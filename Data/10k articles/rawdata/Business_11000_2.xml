'''Alexandre Marie Auguste Jamar''' (6 November 1821 &amp;ndash; 15 August 1888) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] businessman, liberal politician and former governor of the [[National Bank of Belgium]] (NBB) from 1882 until 1888. From 1868 to 1870, he was Minister of Public Works, in the government of [[Walthère Frère-Orban]].

== Career ==
Born in [[Brussels]] on 6 November 1821, Jamar started his career at the age of 17, when he became a partner in the family printing business of his brother. Later on he became a commissioner for the ''{{lang|fr|Banque de Belgique}}'' and had a seat on the first management board of the ''{{lang|fr|Caisse Générale d'Épargne et de Retraite}}'' and the ''{{lang|fr|Crédit Communal}}''.

Jamar became a censor at the NBB in 1865 and a member of the discount committee of the NBB.  In 1870 he became director of the NBB and in 1882 governor of the National Bank of Belgium.  During his time in office he had to deal with the consequences of an economic depression.  In addition he had to deal with problems within the [[Latin Monetary Union]], caused by the refusal of Belgium to sign the new convention of 1885. His experience in the printing business resulted in better quality [[banknote]]s.

Jamar died in Brussels on 15 August 1888.

He also runs many other firms in Argentina, the U.S., and elsewhere, and resides in [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Miami]].&lt;ref name=fortuna&gt;{{cite web| title =Carlos Molinari: del barrio cerrado a las viviendas sociales | work =FortunaWeb| url = http://fortunaweb.com.ar/2013-03-29-119045-carlos-molinari-del-barrio-cerrado-a-las-viviendas-sociales/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=avion&gt;{{cite web| title =Molinari, el empresario K que quiere los aviones| work =El Observador| date =Nov 10, 2012| url = http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/234540/molinari-el-empresario-k-que-quiere-los-aviones/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molinari described himself in 2011 during a brief foray into electoral politics as “a businessman who believes in social justice,&lt;ref name=avion/&gt;”. He is a longtime associate of the Kirchner family and a key figure in the so-called K money trail, the 2013 political scandal centering on acts of embezzlement and money laundering by persons connected to the presidential administrations of [[Nestor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner]].

==Career==
Molinari has been described as the “son of a trade unionist” and as being “of humble origins.”&lt;ref name=avion/&gt;

He is president of Real Estate Investments (REI) Sociedad Fiduciaria, which manages real estate in Argentina, including the 68-hectare Hudson Park in Berazategui.&lt;ref name=elentr&gt;{{cite web| title =Millonario K ligado a Concordia | work =El Entrerios| date =May 10, 2013| url = http://www.elentrerios.com/politica/millonario-k-ligado-a-concordia.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hudson Park, “an exclusive gated community,” has been described as Molinari’s “beloved child.” It includes houses, a condo-hotel, and shops, all built at an investment of around $30 million.”&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;

In the U.S., Molinari is the President of Global Development Consultant Inc., based in Miami, Florida, and registered in 2009. He is also a Managing Member of Adg Group Holdings, LLC; The New Langford, LLC.; and La Bahia, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wysk.com/index/florida/miami/8dyyan3/global-development-consultant-inc/profile |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517120341/http://www.wysk.com/index/florida/miami/8dyyan3/global-development-consultant-inc/profile |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he has served as an officer of several now-inactive U.S. entities, such as the Americas Real Estate Investments Inc., American Condo Hotel Group, Miami Wolf Soccer Team Inc., MDJ Housing Industries Corp., Argentinian Construction Group LLC, and National Argentine American Foundation, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;https://opencorporates.com/officers/8100171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizapedia.com/people/CARLOS-MOLINARI.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Hudson Park, Molinari has constructed a hotel-condominium development, La Aldea de Pilar, and a project called “La Mansión,” a complex of “VIP towers” in the historical district of Quilmes.  Noting that all three of these projects are located in areas governed by Kirchernist politicians, a journalist for Perfil observed that “politics often helps one find more and better opportunities.”&lt;ref name=perfil/&gt;

In March 2013 Molinari was described as being currently engaged in “developing a condo-hotel in a historic downtown building” in “most Latin American cities.” At the time, he was planning to initiate such projects shortly in Punta del Este, Pilar, Bernal, Mar del Plata, and Rosario.&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;

Molinari has built low-cost housing in [[Haiti]] out of containers. Molinari explained that this was an ecologically positive activity, given that there are “a lot of unused containers” in ports and that their rusting “causes severe environmental pollution problems.... By using this material, we are recovering a toxic waste.”&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;

Molinari was described in 2013 as a gifted analyst of the real-estate market, who in a 2004 conversation with [[Tomás Pedro Regalado|Tomás Regalado]], later elected mayor of Miami, predicted the mortgage crisis “when nobody was talking about anything but the euphoria of large investments.”&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;

It was reported in March 2013 that Molinari had “recently” started work on a 40-hectare Public Industrial Park in Canelones, [[Uruguay]], an investment of $120 million.&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;

Molinari is a director or shareholder of such Argentinian firms as Land Developer SA, and Sharks Sports SA, ADG Argentinian Developer Group SA, among others.&lt;ref name=eeuu&gt;{{cite web| last =Santoro| first =Daniel| title =Caso Báez: uno de los involucrados, en problemas con la Justicia de EE.UU.| work =Clarin| date =Nov 7, 2013| url = http://www.clarin.com/politica/Caso-Baez-involucrados-Justicia-EEUU_0_953904630.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, it was reported that Molinari wanted “to create a new airline in forty-five days.” He was in negotiations to buy seven aircraft from the defunct Uruguayan airline Pluna, which was in bankruptcy proceedings, and re-employ most of its 700 former employees. He presented Homero Guerrero, secretary to the Uruguayan president, with a plan to purchase the aircraft for close to $130 million and form a Uruguayan-based airline called Alas Sudamericanas, at an initial total investment of $190 million, that would be in the air within 45 days. He even met with President Mujica of Uruguay.  But the plan did not work out. Molinari complained that the issue had been “politicized.” He said, however, that he was carrying out feasibility studies aimed at the creation of his own Uruguayan airline, explaining that Uruguay ”is a strategic point in Latin America.”&lt;ref name=fortuna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prensa.cancilleria.gov.ar/noticia.php?id%3D26627639 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517124401/http://prensa.cancilleria.gov.ar/noticia.php?id=26627639 |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molinari is a founding member of the regional business platform Developers &amp; Builders Alliance (DBA), which has offices in the U.S. and throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name=urug&gt;{{cite web| last =Ladra| first =Antonio| title =Uruguay en la ruta del dinero de los K| work =El Contecer| date =Apr 16, 2013| url = http://www.elacontecer.com.uy/18819-uruguay-en-la-ruta-del-dinero-de-los-k.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
In 2011, Molinari ran as deputy when his friend [[Mario Ishii]] challenged the candidacy of [[Daniel Scioli]] for re-election as governor of the Buenos Aires province. "We are a possible alternative to the management of the current provincial leader,” Molinari told an interviewer. “We are able to see an alternative for the people of Buenos Aires with my practicality and with the ideological capacity of Mario Ishii.” Ishii and Molinari failed to win, despite a reported expenditure by Molinari of 6 million pesos.&lt;ref name=urug/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elembudo.tv/politica/40-politica/1171-la-extrana-historia-de-carlos-molinari-ex-companero-de-formula-de-mario-ishii.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517121118/http://www.elembudo.tv/politica/40-politica/1171-la-extrana-historia-de-carlos-molinari-ex-companero-de-formula-de-mario-ishii.html |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latecla.info/3/nota_1.php?noticia_id=46948&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obama connection===
Molinari is friendly with Miami businessman [[Freddy Balsera]], who led the [[Barack Obama]] campaign’s outreach effort to Latinos and is head of the Hispanic Council of the Democratic Party in the U.S. Together, Molinari and Balsera have been involved together in a business venture involving “social housing.”&lt;ref name=avion/&gt;&lt;ref name=urug/&gt;

Molinari visited the White House in 2010 and contributed financially to the reelection campaign of President Obama in 2010.&lt;ref name=eeuu/&gt;  He also attended a 2010 dinner in Miami in support of Obama at the mansion of Gloria and Emilio Estefan, where he spoke to President Obama.&lt;ref name=elentr/&gt;
He has also donated to the [[Democratic Party PAC ActBlue]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.city-data.com/elec2/10/elec-MIAMI-FL-10-part3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===K money trail scandal===
{{Main|The K money trail}}
The scandal erupted as a result of the April 14, 2013, episode of the investigative journalism program ''Periodismo para todos (Journalism for All)'', hosted by [[Jorge Lanata]]. The episode, entitled “The K money trail,” included hidden-camera footage on which [[Leonardo Fariña]], the husband of famous model [[Karina Jelinek]], described in detail the financial maneuvers whereby [[Lázaro Báez]], a businessman close to the Kirchners, managed to transfer about 55 million euros from Argentina to [[Switzerland]]. Fariña had aided in this money-laundering operation, and it was established that the link between Báez and Fariña was Molinari, who was described as the “protector” of Fariña, a childhood friend of his son Martin.&lt;ref name=urug/&gt;

Appearing on the [[Jorge Rial]] radio program later in April, Molinari maintained that he had no involvement in money-laundering; that he had never met Báez; that he had met Fariña in late 2010, when Fariña had approached him with the idea of starting a luxury-car rental agency; and that he had known Federico Elaskar since the latter was 15 years old and a friend of his son, living in the same apartment building as the Molinaris, but that he had never done business with him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarin.com/politica/Molinari-Elaskar-conozco-amigo-hijo_0_906509541.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perfil.com/politica/Hablo-Carlos-Molinari-el-multimillonario-jefe-de-Leo-Faria-20130423-0031.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarin.com/politica/Empresario-blanquear-contactos-Elaskar-Farina_0_907109322.html&lt;/ref&gt; “I'm a businessman,” Molinari said. “I do business.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elliberal.com.ar/ampliada.php?ID=87665&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgente24.com/213356-la-version-de-molinari-el-millonario-protector-de-farina?pagination%3Dshow |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517122549/http://www.urgente24.com/213356-la-version-de-molinari-el-millonario-protector-de-farina?pagination=show |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/68847/&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 2013, Molinari was violently assaulted by five men in the Palermo section of Buenos Aires who took several items from him, including his Audi A7 truck, which was found abandoned shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1576136-asaltan-y-golpean-al-empresario-carlos-molinari&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that the beating and robbery of Molinari were the work of “mobsters” sending a “message.”&lt;ref name=eeuu/&gt;

[[Elisa Carrió]], a member of the Argentinian parliament, described Fariña in April 2013 as being “protected” by Molinari.&lt;ref&gt;http://tn.com.ar/politica/carrio-%E2%80%9Ctodo-lo-que-dice-farina-tiene-respaldo-documental%E2%80%9D_383507&lt;/ref&gt;

Fariña testified in June 2013 that he was an auditor for Austral Construcciones, a firm owned by Báez, and that he worked for Molinari, who paid him a monthly salary of 70,000 pesos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1590774-leonardo-farina-declaro-ante-la-justicia-y-admitio-que-conoce-a-lazaro-baez&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June 2013, Maximiliano Acosta told a court that Molinari and his son Mathias had presented themselves to him as project developers and as representatives of Báez and his son.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1589050-el-testigo-de-boda-de-farina-complico-a-perez-gadin&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in July 2013 that Molinari was “in trouble” in the U.S. courts. He was sought in connection with a Miami trial, ''Carlos Germán Díaz vs Global Development Consultant Inc'', in which he was named as a defendant, and with a New York case, brought by Kenneth Welt against Diego Molinari, Deborah Batista, and Amadeo Molinari of [[Moll Systems Corporation]], that involved a payment to a Panamanian firm, [[Tensho Media]].&lt;ref name=eeuu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dockets.justia.com/docket/florida/flsdce/1:2013cv20729/416235&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, federal judge Sebastián Casanello ordered a raid on Molinari’s firm Rei Fiduciaria, in order to determine the legitimacy of Fariña’s claim that his lavish lifestyle could be accounted for by his income from Rei Fudiciaria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1616457-caso-baez-allanan-una-firma-y-carrio-pide-interpelar-a-timerman&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with Fariña===
Molinari has been described as the man who “invented” the husband of Karina Jelinek, “since it was he who gave her the famous Ferrari” and paid for the couple’s wedding. Molinari said that Fariña had been recommended to him by a lawyer in La Plata. “He proposed to me the business of high-end car rental, and bought five cars, some on behalf of the company and others in my name,” said Molinari. “The idea was good, because they were cars that were not in Argentina.” At that time Fariña had not yet become involved with Jelinek, and “seemed to be a person with an ordinary life.” Molinari said he paid Fariña “a per diem of six thousand dollars and also had a stake in the [car-rental] company.” After Fariña and Jelinek became a couple, Molinari disliked the negative press that the couple generated and encouraged Fariña to lower his profile and to clarify that his car was company-owned and that he was not a millionaire. Molinari said he had paid for Fariña’s and Jelinek’s wedding, a total outlay of 480,000 pesos, in order to promote the car-rental firm, some of whose wares were on display at the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1591140-farina-dejo-muchas-dudas-ante-el-juez&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lasombradelespectaculo.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/escandalo-farina-rossi-carlos-molinari-el-hombre-que-invento-al-empresario/&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaskar testified that he knew Fariña through Molinari’s son Matías. The elder Molinari, said Elaskar, had given his wife an Audi as a wedding gift.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1590825-caso-baez-farina-y-elaskar-acusaron-a-lanata-ante-el-juez&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Molinari has five sons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perfil.com/politica/Molinari-el-magnate-con-lazos-politicos-detras-del-escandalo-20130421-0001.html&lt;/ref&gt; He had a son with Lucrecia Silva, a former ballet dancer and former TV host and the current owner of a baby-clothing store in Concordia, in which Molinari reportedly invested. Their son’s christening party was held at Club Progreso in 2012.&lt;ref name=elentr/&gt;

Molinari’s luxurious house in Pilar, Buenos Aires, was the subject of a feature in the magazine ''Caras'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urgente24.com/12574-molinari-como-jelinek-en-caras-nunca-trabaje-por-diner{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performing artist [[Marixa Balli]] stated in 2013 that Molinari had been her CD producer and lover in Miami many years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarin.com/politica/Ruta_del_dinero_K-Marixa_Balli-gastos-Carlos_Molinari-Leonarido_Farina_0_907109544.html&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that he had paid for her most recent trip to Miami.&lt;ref name=eeuu/&gt;

The '''Carnegie Deli''' was an iconic small [[delicatessen]] chain based in [[New York City]]. Its main branch, opened in 1937 adjacent to [[Carnegie Hall]], was located at 854 [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|7th Avenue]] (between [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th]] and [[55th Street (Manhattan)|55th Street]]s) in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. There are subsidiaries in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]]; [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]; [[Six Flags Great Adventure]]. The deli, though having had its main branch closed, still operates a wholesale distribution service.

The Parker family's [[delicatessen]] was in its third generation of owners. Among the United States' most renowned delis, it was operated by a second-generation owner, Marian Harper Levine.

The restaurant offered [[pastrami]], [[corned beef]], and other sandwiches containing at least {{Convert|1|lb|kg}} of meat, as well as traditional [[Jewish]] fare such as [[matzoh ball]] soup, [[latke]]s, chopped [[chicken liver]]s, and [[lox]]. The restaurant also offered other, non-Jewish (or at least non-[[kosher]]) food such as [[ham]], [[sausage]], and [[bacon]]. Available for order were [[cheesecake]] portions of over a pound per serving. The restaurant's [[motto]] was: "If you can finish your meal, we've done something wrong". In addition to the large servings, the restaurant was also known for its surly waiters, who allegedly tried to impart some of the stereotypical gruffness of New York to visitors.

The main branch on Seventh Avenue closed on December 30, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abc7ny.com/business/iconic-carnegie-deli-closes-at-midnight/1533412/ "Iconic Carnegie Deli closes at midnight"], ''[[Eyewitness News]]'', [[WABC-TV|ABC 7 New York]], December 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/carnegie-deli-new-york-city-closes-pastrami-sandwiches/ "'It is delicious, we will miss it so much': NYC's legendary Carnegie Deli says goodbye"], CBS News, December 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The other three branches and the distribution service remain open.{{refn|group=note|name=press|"We appreciate all your heartfelt wishes and your love of the Carnegie Deli.

== History ==

===Early history===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
[[Leo Steiner]] (c. 1939 – December 31, 1987) was a Jewish American restaurateur who was co-owner of the first Carnegie Deli, located at 55th Street and [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]] near [[Carnegie Hall]]. While his partner, [[Milton Parker]], mostly worked behind the scenes, Steiner worked the crowd with his Jewish humor in the restaurant, which became a destination for both celebrities and tourists in the theater district. Steiner was born in Newark, New Jersey. He worked in his parents' grocery store in nearby Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he grew up. The one-time owner of Pastrami &amp; Things, a delicatessen located at Third Avenue and 23rd Street, he joined Milton Parker and Fred Klein in 1976, purchasing the Carnegie Deli from the trio of Bernie Gross, Max Hudas and Thomas North. Klein, who had not been actively involved in running the business, dropped out shortly thereafter.

Under the management of Parker and Steiner, the deli became known nationwide, attracting celebrities such as Woody Allen, Jackie Mason and Henny Youngman, and opened branch locations in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]; [[Secaucus, New Jersey]]; and [[Tysons Corner, Virginia]]. Steiner became the public face of Jewish food, appearing in a television commercial for rye bread. He created a 60-pound Statue of Liberty carved from chopped liver, complete with a torch fashioned from a turkey wing, for the United States Bicentennial and was asked to prepare corned beef and pastrami for visiting heads of state attending the G7 economic summit meeting held in 1983 in Williamsburg, Virginia. Portions of Woody Allen's 1984 movie Broadway Danny Rose were filmed in the restaurant.

Milton Parker, who died in 2009, had written a book (with Allyn Freeman) called ''How to Feed Friends and Influence People: The Carnegie Deli'', providing the history of the family's ownership.

===Main branch closures===
On April 24, 2015, the main, Midtown Manhattan branch of Carnegie Deli was closed temporarily due to the discovery of an illegal gas line in the restaurant. [[Con Edison]] was investigating the restaurant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burke |first1=Kerry |last2=Smith |first2=Greg | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-famed-carnegie-deli-closed-illegal-gas-line-hookup-article-1.2198242 | title=NYC's famed Carnegie Deli closed for illegal gas connection | work=New York Daily News | date=24 April 2015 | accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; later fining the eatery $40,050.&lt;ref name="Settembre 2016"/&gt; On July 28, 2015, Carnegie Deli was subsequently closed for upgrades to its energy lines after the discovery of improperly siphoning off natural gas for the previous six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Novellino |first=Teresa |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2015/07/28/shuttered-carnegie-deli-plans-to-reopen-asap.html |title=After 3 pastrami-less months, Carnegie Deli plans to reopen ASAP |date= 28 July 2015|website= |publisher=New York Business Journals |access-date=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deli reopened on February 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Pulos | first=Will | title=Carnegie Deli will reopen tomorrow after being closed for 10 months | website=Time Out New York | date=2016-02-08 | url=https://www.timeout.com/newyork/blog/carnegie-deli-will-reopen-tomorrow-after-being-closed-for-10-months-020816 | accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=McGeehan | first=Patrick | title=Carnegie Deli Reopens After a 10-Month Shutdown | website=The New York Times | date=2016-02-09 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/nyregion/carnegie-deli-reopens-after-a-10-month-shutdown.html | accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2016, it was announced that the Midtown Manhattan branch of the deli would close by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cuozzo|first1=Steve|title=Carnegie Deli will close at end of 2016|url=https://nypost.com/2016/09/30/carnegie-deli-will-close-at-end-of-2016/|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner, Marian Harper Levine, stated that she needed a more permanent break from operating the restaurant, saying, "At this stage of my life, the early morning to late night days have taken a toll, along with my sleepless nights and grueling hours that come with operating a restaurant business in Manhattan."&lt;ref name="Settembre 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Settembre | first=Jeanette | title=Carnegie Deli will close at end of 2016 | website=NY Daily News | date=2016-09-30 | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/carnegie-deli-close-2016-article-1.2812899 | accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two branches in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]], and in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], will remain open, as well as its wholesale distribution service.&lt;ref name="Settembre 2016"/&gt;

At midnight on December 31, 2016, Carnegie Deli on Seventh Avenue closed after almost eighty years of service.

==Cuisine and culture==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
The deli's corned beef and pastrami, celebrated by smoked meat connoisseurs nationwide, were cured in the store's cellar using Steiner's own recipe in a two-week-long curing process. The Carnegie Deli used a half-ton of brisket to prepare a week's supply of corned beef by the time of his death. Steiner admitted, "You could eat it after seven days, but if you wait until the 13th you're in heaven." The Carnegie Deli was the favorite hangout of [[comedian]] [[Henny Youngman]], and [[Adam Sandler]] included a reference to the deli in "[[The Chanukah Song]]" in 1996. Steiner was eulogized by comedian Henny Youngman as "the deli lama".

The walls of the deli are nearly completely covered with autographed pictures of celebrities who have eaten there. Menu items have been named after famous patrons, including a corned beef and pastrami sandwich named after [[Woody Allen]] after the deli served as a filming location for ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]].'' A number of items on the menu feature [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] themes and [[Yiddish]] vocabulary, including dishes like "[[wikt:nosh|nosh]], nosh, Nanette" (after the musical, "[[No, No, Nanette]]") and "the egg and oy" ("[[The Egg and I]]"). There are also some humorous items in the menu, like the famous liver sandwich named "50 Ways to Love Your Liver" after the [[Paul Simon]] song "[[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover]]." It is a place many reporters in the city frequent, including staffers from Black Rock (aka the [[CBS Building]]) like [[Bob Simon]].

In March 2012, the deli introduced a sandwich dedicated to newly arrived [[New York Jets]] quarterback [[Tim Tebow]]. The sandwich, named the "Jetbow", is priced at $22.22, weighs in at 3.5&amp;nbsp;lbs and consists of corned beef, pastrami, roast beef, American cheese, lettuce and tomato on white bread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2012/03/26/carnegie-deli-creates-tim-tebow-inspired-jetbow-sandwich/#ixzz28wfZ3pzk |title=NYC deli creates Tim Tebow-inspired ‘Jetbow’ sandwich |work=[[Fox News]] |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Branch locations ==
[[File:Carnegie deli.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the Carnegie Deli]]
The deli opened several branch locations in the 1980s, including two New Jersey branches in [[Secaucus]] and [[Atlantic City]] and one in the Washington, D.C. suburbs in [[Tysons Corner]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, David. [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/09/us/washington-talk-suburbia-pastrami-with-glitz-and-politesse.html?scp=20&amp;sq=%22carnegie%20deli%22&amp;st=cse "Washington Talk: Suburbia; Pastrami, With Glitz and Politesse"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1987-10-09. Retrieved on 2009-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of these branches have since closed and are no longer in operation. One, in [[Beverly Hills, California]], was financed by oil billionaire [[Marvin Davis]] and designed by restaurant designer [[Pat Kuleto]] at a cost of $4 million to be the "best deli in the world", in response to Davis' complaint that the delis in California were not as good as those in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Pastrami on Rye, Hold the West Coast|author=David Margolick|date=November 16, 1994|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/16/garden/pastrami-on-rye-hold-the-west-coast.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deli operates a second location on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], which opened at [[The Mirage]] in 2005. A third location opened in 2006 at the [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] in [[New Jersey]] and serves as the "healthy choice" restaurant at the park; however, the menu is smaller and only has the restaurant's most popular items. The fifth location is at the [[Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem|Sands Casino Resort]] in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and opened November 22, 2009.

In addition to the retail operation, the restaurant sells cheesecakes and merchandise such as T-shirts and baseball caps online.

==Critical reception==
In 2013, ''[[Zagat]]'' gave it a food rating of 23, and rated it the 8th-best deli in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zagat.com/r/carnegie-deli-manhattan|title=Carnegie Deli Manhattan |work=zagat.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[USA Today]]'' has called the restaurant the "most famous" deli in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Seth |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/books/reviews/2005-01-30-deli_x.htm |date=2005-01-30 |title=Deli owner has recipe for success |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |access-date=2015-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central Park''' is an [[urban park]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It is located between the [[Upper West Side]] and [[Upper East Side]], roughly bounded by [[Fifth Avenue]] on the east, [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Central Park West]] (Eighth Avenue) on the west, [[59th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park South]] (59th Street) on the south, and [[110th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park North]] (110th Street) on the north. Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States, with 40 million visitors in 2013, and one of the most filmed locations in the world. In terms of area, Central Park is the [[List of New York City parks|fifth-largest park in New York City]], covering {{convert|843|acre|ha}}.

The park was established in 1857 on {{convert|778|acre|ha}} of land acquired by the city. In 1858, landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and architect/landscape designer [[Calvert Vaux]] won a [[Architectural design competition|design competition]] to improve and expand the park with a plan they titled the "Greensward Plan". Construction began the same year, and the park's first area was opened to the public in the winter of 1858. Construction north of the park continued during the [[American Civil War]] in the 1860s, and the park was expanded to its current size in 1873. After a period of decline in the early 20th century, [[Robert Moses]] started a program to clean up Central Park. Another decline in the late 20th century spurred the creation of the [[Central Park Conservancy]] in 1980, which refurbished many parts of the park during the 1980s and 1990s.

Central Park was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]] in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/66000538&lt;/ref&gt; which in April 2017 placed it on the tentative list for [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6234/ Central Park], UNESCO tentative list&lt;/ref&gt; The park, managed for decades by the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]], is currently managed by the Central Park Conservancy under contract with the municipal government in a public-private partnership. The Conservancy is a non-profit organization that contributes 75 percent of Central Park's $65 million annual budget and is responsible for all basic care of the 843-acre park.

Central Park, which has been a [[National Historic Landmark]] since 1962, was designed by landscape architect and writer [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and the English architect [[Calvert Vaux]] in 1858 after winning a design competition. They also designed [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]].&lt;ref name="nhlsum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=388&amp;ResourceType=District|title=Central Park|date=September 10, 2007|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013053342/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceID=388&amp;resourceType=District|archivedate=October 13, 2007}}

Central Park constitutes its own United States [[census tract]], number 143. According to [[American Community Survey]] 5-year estimates, the park's population was five people, all female, with a [[median age]] of 19.8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://censusreporter.org/profiles/14000US36061014300-census-tract-143-new-york-ny/|title=Census Tract 143, New York, NY|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Central Park officials have rejected the claim of anyone permanently living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Census Apparently Did Check Behind Every Tree|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/nyregion/26census.html?_r=1&amp; | work=The New York Times | first=Alan|last=Feuer|date=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real estate value of Central Park was estimated by property appraisal firm Miller Samuel to be about $528.8 billion in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Robledo, S. Jhoanna; [http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/reasonstoloveny/15362/index.html "Central Park: Because We Wouldn't Trade a Patch of Grass for $528,783,552,000"] ''[[New York (magazine)|NYMag.com]]'', December 18, 2005 (Retrieved: August 26, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Central Park's size and cultural position, similar to London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and Munich's [[Englischer Garten]], has served as a model for many urban parks, including San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]], Tokyo's [[Ueno Park]], and Vancouver's [[Stanley Park]]. The park, which receives approximately 35 million visitors annually,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/general-info/faq/|title=Central Park FAQ|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524211246/http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/general-info/faq/|archivedate=May 24, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is the most visited [[urban park]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpl.org/content_documents/ccpe_MostVisitedParks.pdf|title=America's Most Visited City Parks|accessdate=July 11, 2006|date=June 2006|format=PDF|publisher=The Trust for Public Land|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060725034722/http://www.tpl.org/content_documents/ccpe_MostVisitedParks.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the most filmed location in the world. A December 2017 report found that 231 movies have used Central Park for on-location shoots, more than the 160 movies that have filmed in [[Greenwich Village]] or the 99 movies that have filmed in [[Times Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Pereira | first=Ivan | title=Central Park is a film superstar | website=am New York | date=December 10, 2017 | url=https://www.amny.com/news/central-park-most-filmed-1.15405440 | access-date=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park is maintained by the Central Park Conservancy, a private, [[not-for-profit]] organization that manages the park under a contract with the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]],&lt;ref name="Conservancy"/&gt; in which the president of the Conservancy is ''[[ex officio]]'' Administrator of Central Park. Today, the conservancy employs 80% of maintenance and operations staff in the park. It effectively oversees the work of both the private and public employees under the authority of the Central Park administrator (publicly appointed), who reports to the parks commissioner, conservancy's president. {{As of|2007}}, the conservancy had invested approximately $450 million in the restoration and management of the park; the organization presently contributes approximately 85% of Central Park's annual operating budget of over $37 million.&lt;ref name="Conservancy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/about/about-cpc |title=About the Central Park Conservancy|website= Central Park Conservancy|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was functioning so well that in 2006 the conservancy created the Historic Harlem Parks initiative, providing horticultural and maintenance support and mentoring in [[Morningside Park (New York City)|Morningside Park]], St. Nicholas Park, Jackie Robinson Park, and [[Marcus Garvey Park]].&lt;ref name="Blonsky, Douglas Op-Ed"/&gt;

The park has its own [[New York City Police Department]] precinct—the Central Park Precinct—which employs both regular police and auxiliary officers. In 2005, safety measures held the number of crimes in the park to fewer than one hundred per year (down from approximately 1,000 annually in the early 1980s). The [[New York City Parks Enforcement Patrol]] also patrols Central Park. There is an all-volunteer ambulance service, the [[Central Park Medical Unit]], that provides free [[medical emergency|emergency medical]] service to patrons of Central Park and the surrounding streets. It operates a rapid-response bicycle patrol, particularly during major events such as the [[New York City Marathon]], the [[1998 Goodwill Games]], and concerts in the park.

While planting and land form in much of the park appear natural, it is in fact almost entirely landscaped. The park contains several natural-looking lakes and ponds that have been created artificially by damming natural seeps and flows.
There is a large area of woods in addition to seven major lawns, the "meadows",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/nyregion/conservancy-marks-milestone-in-restoring-central-park.html "Restoring a meadow to grandeur: Conservancy marks milestone in Central Park", September 2011]
&lt;/ref&gt; and many minor grassy areas; some of them are used for informal or team sports and some set aside as quiet areas; there are a number of enclosed [[playground]]s for children. The {{convert|6|mi|km}} of drives within the park are used by joggers, cyclists, skateboarders, and inline skaters, especially when automobile traffic is prohibited, on weekends and in the evenings after 7:00 pm.

[[File:Central Park Bolt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[John Randel]]'s survey bolt]]&lt;/div&gt;
Between 1821 and 1855, New York City nearly quadrupled in population. As the city expanded northward up Manhattan Island, people were drawn to the few existing open spaces, mainly cemeteries, to get away from the noise and chaotic life in the city. Since Central Park was not part of the original [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]], John Randel, Jr., surveyed the grounds. The only remaining surveying bolt from his survey is embedded in a rock located north of the present Dairy and the 65th Street Transverse, and south of Center Drive. The bolt marks the location where West 65th Street would have intersected [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Todd, John Emerson Todd| title=Frederick Law Olmsted (see the history of [[Green-Wood Cemetery]])|location= Boston|publisher= Twayne Publishers: Twayne's World Leader Series| date= 1982|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City's need for a great public park was resounded by the famed poet and editor of the ''Evening Post'' (now the ''[[New York Post]]''), [[William Cullen Bryant]], as well as by the first American landscape architect, [[Andrew Jackson Downing]], who predicted and began to publicize the city's need for a public park in 1844. A stylish place for open-air driving, similar to Paris' [[Bois de Boulogne]] or London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], was felt to be needed by many influential New Yorkers, and, after an abortive attempt in 1850–1851 to designate [[Jones's Wood]], in 1853 the [[New York legislature]] settled upon a {{convert|750|acre|ha|adj=on}} area from 59th to 106th Streets for the creation of the park, at a cost of more than US$5 million for the land.&lt;ref name="timeline-1850-debate"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centralparkhistory.com/timeline/timeline_1850_debate.html |publisher=CentralParkHistory.com |title=The Great Park Debate – 1850 |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeline-1850-taking"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centralparkhistory.com/timeline/timeline_1850_taking.html |publisher=CentralParkHistory.com|title=Taking the Land – 1850 |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia-dolkart"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ci.columbia.edu/0240s/0244_3/0244_3_s3_text.html |author=Andrew S.

The state appointed a Central Park Commission to oversee the development of the park, and in 1857 the commission held a landscape design contest. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]] developed what came to be known as the "Greensward Plan", which was selected as the winning design. According to Olmsted, the park was "of great importance as the first real Park made in this country&amp;nbsp;– a democratic development of the highest significance...", a view probably inspired by his various trips to Europe during 1850&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olmsted letter to Parke Godwin August 1, 1858|work=Empire City: The Making and Meaning of the New York City Landscape|url= http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/714_reg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (he had visited several parks during these trips and was particularly impressed by [[Birkenhead Park]] and [[Derby Arboretum]] in England).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centralparkhistory.com/timeline/timeline_1850_compete.html |work= CentralParkHistory.com |title= The Design Competition |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centralparkhistory.com/timeline/timeline_1850_victors.html|work= CentralParkHistory.com |title= The Victors |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greensward Plan called for [[List of arches and bridges in Central Park|some 36 bridges]], all designed by Vaux, ranging from rugged spans of [[Manhattan schist]] or [[granite]], to lacy [[Neo-Gothic]] cast iron; no two are alike. The ensemble of the formal line of [[Central Park Mall|the Mall]]'s doubled allées of elms culminating at Bethesda Terrace, whose centerpiece is the [[Bethesda Fountain]], with a composed view beyond of lake and woodland, was at the heart of the larger design. Execution of the Greensward Plan was the responsibility of a number of individuals, including [[Jacob Wrey Mould]] (architect), [[Ignaz Anton Pilat]] (master gardener), [[George E. Waring, Jr.]] (engineer), and [[Andrew Haswell Green]] (politician), in addition to Olmsted and Vaux.&lt;ref name="timeline-1850-debate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timeline-1850-taking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia-dolkart"/&gt;

Several influences came together in the design. Landscaped cemeteries, such as [[Mount Auburn Cemetery|Mount Auburn]] ([[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]) and [[Green-Wood Cemetery|Green-Wood]] ([[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]]) had set examples of idyllic, naturalistic landscapes. The most influential innovations in the Central Park design were the "separate circulation" systems for pedestrians, horseback riders, and pleasure vehicles. The "crosstown" commercial traffic was entirely concealed in sunken roadways (today called "transverses"), screened with densely planted shrub belts so as to maintain a rustic ambiance.

At the same time, the offsetting revenue from [[property tax]]es of adjacent land came to $1.7 million, or one-third of the purchase price, and was considerably less than earlier estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://centralparkhistory.com/timeline/timeline_1850_taking.html|title=CentralParkHistory.com|website=centralparkhistory.com|access-date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the park's construction, Olmsted battled with the park commissioners, many of them also politicians. In 1860, he was forced out for the first of many times as Central Park's superintendent, and [[Andrew Haswell Green]], the former president of New York City's Board of Education took over as the commission's chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypap.org/content/andrew-haswell-green|title=Andrew Haswell Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his having relatively little experience, Green managed to accelerate the construction. Green also finalized the negotiations to purchase an additional {{convert|65|acre|m2}} at the north end of the park, between 106th and 110th Streets, which would be used as the "rugged" part of the park, its swampy northeast corner dredged, and reconstructed as the [[Harlem Meer, Central Park|Harlem Meer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centralpark.com/pages/attractions/harlem-meer.html |publisher=Centralpark.com |title=Harlem Meer |accessdate=October 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408124159/http://www.centralpark.com/pages/attractions/harlem-meer.html |archive-date=April 8, 2007 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/10/10/105955070.pdf |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |title=Andrew H.

Between 1860 and 1873, most of the major hurdles to construction were overcome, and the park was substantially completed. Construction combined the modern with the ageless: up-to-date steam-powered equipment and custom-designed wheeled tree-moving machines augmented massive numbers of unskilled laborers wielding shovels. The work was extensively documented with technical drawings and photographs. During this period, more than {{convert|18500|yd3|m3}} of topsoil had been transported from [[New Jersey]], because the original soil was neither fertile nor sufficiently substantial to sustain the various trees, shrubs, and plants called for by the Greensward Plan. When the park was officially completed in 1873, more than 10 million cartloads of material had been transported out of the park, including soil and rocks, and more than four million trees, shrubs, and plants representing approximately 1,500 species were transplanted to the park. More gunpowder was used to clear the area than was used at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] during the American Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosenzweig, Roy |author2=Blackmar, Elizabeth |title=The Park and the People: A History of Central Park|date=1992| page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposal to have ornate, European-style entrances to the park was opposed by Olmsted and Vaux, who intended for the park's unadorned entrances to signal "that all were welcome, regardless of rank or wealth."&lt;ref name="July 6, 2014"&gt;Pollak, Michael.

===First decline and renovation===
Following completion, the park quickly slipped into decline. One of the main reasons for this was the lack of interest from the [[Tammany Hall]] political machine, which was the largest political force in New York at the time. Around the turn of the 20th century, the park faced several new challenges. Cars were becoming commonplace, bringing with them their burden of pollution, and people's attitudes were beginning to change. No longer were parks to be used only for walks and picnics in an idyllic environment but also for sports and similar recreation. Following the dissolution of the Central Park Commission in 1870 and Andrew Green's departure from the project, and Vaux's death in 1895, the maintenance effort gradually declined. All of this changed in 1934, when Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]] was elected [[List of mayors of New York City|mayor of New York City]] and unified the five park-related departments then in existence. [[Robert Moses]] was given the task of cleaning up the park. Moses, about to become one of the most powerful men in New York City, took over what was essentially a relic, a leftover from a bygone era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centralparkhistory.com/timeline/timeline_1930_newdeal.html |title=Robert Moses and a New Deal |work=Centralparkhistory.com |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Robert Caro]]:

{{blockquote|Lawns, unseeded, were expanses of bare earth, decorated with scraggly patches of grass and weeds, that became dust holes in dry weather and mud holes in wet... The once beautiful Mall looked like a scene of a wild party the morning after. Benches lay on their backs, their legs jabbing at the sky...&lt;ref name=Caro1974&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9WMDQAAQBAJ|title=The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York|last=Caro|first=Robert A.|publisher=Knopf|year=1974|isbn=978-0-394-48076-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|334}}}}

In a single year, Moses managed to clean up Central Park and other parks in New York City. Lawns and flowers were replanted, dead trees and bushes were replaced, walls were sandblasted, and bridges were repaired. Another dramatic change was Moses's removal of the "[[Hoover valley]]" shantytown, whose site was transformed into the {{convert|30|acre}} Great Lawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stern| first=Robert A.M.|author2=Gregory Gilmartin|author3=Thomas Mellins| title=New York 1930| publisher=Rizzoli New York| year=1987| isbn=978-0-8478-3096-1|page=710}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Major redesigning and construction also was carried out: for instance, the Croton Lower Reservoir was filled in so the [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond, Central Park|Great Lawn]] could be created. The Greensward Plan{{'}}s purpose of creating an idyllic landscape was combined with Moses' vision of a park to be used for recreational purposes: 19 playgrounds, 12 ball fields, and handball courts were constructed. Moses managed to secure funds from the [[New Deal]] program, as well as donations from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centralparkhistory.com/timeline/timeline_1930.html |title= Planting the Seeds for the "Great Lawn" |work=Centralparkhistory.com |accessdate= October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created the 67th Street Transverse, widened West Drive, and evicted the sheep from Sheep Meadow.&lt;ref name=Caro1974/&gt;{{rp|984}}

===The "Events Era" and second decline===

}}
The 1960s marked the beginning of an "Events Era" in Central Park that reflected the widespread cultural and political trends of the period. [[The Public Theater]]'s annual [[Shakespeare in the Park]] festival was settled in the [[Delacorte Theater]] in 1961, and summer performances were instituted on the Sheep Meadow, and then on the Great Lawn by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. During the late 1960s, the park became the venue for rallies and cultural events such as the "[[Love-in]]s" and "[[Central Park be-in|Be-Ins]]" of the period. In 1966, Mayor [[John Lindsay]], an avid cyclist, initiated a weekend ban on automobiles in Central Park for the enjoyment of cyclists and public alike&amp;nbsp;– a policy that continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://jimsbikeblog.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/a-pioneer-of-urban-cycling/ |title=A pioneer of urban cycling| work=Jim's Bike Blog|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly through the 1970s, the park became a venue for events of unprecedented scale, including rallies, demonstrations, festivals, and concerts.

Despite the increasing numbers of visitors to the park, Robert Moses' departure in 1960 marked the beginning of a 20-year period of decline in its management. The city was experiencing economic and social changes, with some residents leaving the city and moving to the suburbs in the wake of increased crime. The [[New York City Parks Department|Parks Department]], suffering from budget cuts, responded by opening the park to any and all activities that would bring people into it, without adequate oversight and maintenance follow-up. Some of these events nevertheless became milestones in the social history of the park and in the cultural history of the city.&lt;ref name="centralparknyc history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/about/history.html |title=The History of Central Park |publisher=Centralparknyc.org |date=August 18, 2009| accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, however, managerial neglect was taking a toll on the park's condition. "Years of poor management and inadequate maintenance had turned a masterpiece of landscape architecture into a virtual dustbowl by day and a danger zone by night", in the opinion of Douglas Blonsky, a president of the [[Central Park Conservancy]].&lt;ref name="Blonsky, Douglas Op-Ed"/&gt; Vandalism, territorial use (e.g. a pick-up game of [[softball]] or [[association football]], which commandeered open space and excluded others), and illicit activities were taking place in the park. Several volunteer citizen groups emerged, intent upon reclaiming the park by fundraising and organizing volunteer initiatives. One of these groups, the Central Park Community Fund, commissioned a study of the park's management. The study's conclusion was bi-linear; it called for establishment of a single position within the New York City Parks Department, responsible for overseeing both the planning and management of Central Park, as well as a board of guardians to provide citizen oversight.&lt;ref name="centralparknyc history"/&gt;

In 1979, Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis established the Office of Central Park Administrator, appointing to the position the executive director of another citizen organization, the Central Park Task Force.&lt;ref name="centralparknyc history"/&gt; The Central Park Conservancy was founded the following year, to support the office and initiatives of the administrator and to provide consistent leadership through a self-perpetuating, citizen-based board that also would include as ex-officio trustees, the Parks Commissioner, the Central Park Administrator, and mayoral appointees.&lt;ref name="centralparknyc history"/&gt;

===Restoration and second renovation===
Under the leadership of the [[Central Park Conservancy]], the park's reclamation began with modest but highly significant first steps, addressing needs that could not be met within the existing structure and resources of the parks department. Interns were hired and a small restoration staff to reconstruct and repair unique rustic features, undertaking horticultural projects, and removing graffiti under the [[broken windows theory]].&lt;ref name="centralparknyc history"/&gt; The state of the park has improved since the 1970s, according to Conservancy president Douglas Blonsky:

{{quote|Graffiti doesn't last 24 hours in Central Park; visible litter gets carted off by 9 each morning and throughout the day. Our workers empty trash receptacles daily (at least) and maintain lawns with tremendous care. Broken benches and playground equipment get fixed on the spot.&lt;ref name="Blonsky, Douglas Op-Ed"&gt;{{cite news| author=Blonsky, Douglas | title= Saving the Park: A key to NYC's revival|url=https://nypost.com/2007/11/03/saving-the-park/| work=New York Post|date= November 3, 2007|page= Op-Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====1980s–90s renovations====
{{multiple image|direction=vertical|width=250|align=left

By 1980, the Conservancy was also engaged in design efforts and long-term restoration planning, using both its own staff and external consultants. It provided the impetus and leadership for several early restoration projects funded by the city, preparing a comprehensive plan for rebuilding the park. The restoration was accompanied by a crucial restructuring of management, whereby the park was subdivided into zones, to each of which a supervisor was designated, responsible for maintaining restored areas. That year, the Dairy (which was originally designed as a refreshment stand and rest spot) was transformed into the park's first visitor's center, with the Conservancy using it to revitalize public interest in the park through exhibits, music series, and children's programs. The first landscape to be restored was the Sheep Meadow, primarily with funds provided by New York State. During the next few years, [[Bethesda Terrace and Fountain]], [[Belvedere Castle]], and the East Green were restored.

Bethesda Fountain, which had been dry for decades, was restored in 1980–81&lt;ref&gt;Murphy and Ottavino 1986:24: "materials science, chemical testing, historical research, and attentive site supervision contributed to the successful rehabilitation of Bethesda Terrace".&lt;/ref&gt; and the Terrace was restored a year later, its stonework disassembled, cleaned, deteriorated surfaces removed, restored, patched, and reset. Resodding, and fifty new trees, 3,500 shrubs and 3,000 ground cover plants specified by Philip Winslow followed in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centralparknyc.org/aboutcpc/cpc-history/cpchistory1980-1988 Central Park Conservancy on-line history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126152855/http://www.centralparknyc.org/aboutcpc/cpc-history/cpchistory1980-1988 |date=January 26, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; most of which, having matured into dense blocks, were removed in 2008, to make way for plants native to the United States. Around the same time, the Belvedere Castle, which had been closed for many years, was renovated and reopened on May 1, 1983, as the [[Henry Luce]] Nature Observatory.

By 1982, the Chess &amp; Checkers House and Frisbee Hill had been restored; thousands of shrubs and flowers asserted the park as a horticultural showpiece. To tend to those plants, more than 1,900 volunteers contributed more than 4,000 hours of work in the park. On completion of the planning stage in 1985, the conservancy launched its first capital campaign, assuming increasing responsibility for funding the park's restoration, and full responsibility for designing, bidding, and supervising all capital projects in the park.&lt;ref name="centralparknyc history"/&gt; The Conservancy launched its first fundraising campaign in 1986, mapping out a 15-year restoration plan that sought to remain true to the original design. Over the next several years, ''Campaign for the Central Park Conservancy'' restored landmarks in the southern part of the park&amp;nbsp;– [[Grand Army Plaza (Manhattan)|Grand Army Plaza]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encnyc}}, pp. 497-498; {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/01/garden/currents-grand-army-plaza-s-rather-grand-history.html|title=Currents; Grand Army Plaza's Rather Grand History|last=Louie|first=Elaine|date=March 1, 1990|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/28/arts/review-architecture-a-restored-grand-army-plaza-with-a-new-coat-for-the-general.html?pagewanted=1|title=Review/Architecture; A Restored Grand Army Plaza, With a New Coat for the General|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|date=June 28, 1990|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/02/opinion/grand-army-plaza-redressed.html?pagewanted=1|title=Grand Army Plaza, Redressed|date=July 2, 1990|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}; {{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Ann Lee|title=The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|series=Oxford reference online|page=45|isbn=978-0-19-512878-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pyvjWAcwnHEC&amp;pg=PA45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare Garden, and [[Cedar Hill (Central Park)|Cedar Hill]]. By 1988, Conservancy volunteers logged more than 13,000 hours in the park, with the organization's volunteer program winning a citation for excellence from the [[White House]].

In the early 1990s, the Conservancy announced a $50 million capital campaign to focus on improvements to the northern end of the park. Efforts culminated in the restoration of the Mall and Concert Ground, [[Harlem Meer]], and the Ravine in the North Woods. The Conservancy's work on the Meer and the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center was subsequently honored with three awards: the 1994 New York City Landmarks Preservation Award, the American Society of Landscape Architects' Design Merit Award and the Victorian Society's Citation of Merit. In 1996, the Conservancy embarked on its most ambitious landscape restoration: the overhaul of the {{convert|55|acres|abbr=off}} including and surrounding the [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond]] (formerly the Great Lawn and the Belvedere Lake).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turtle Pond |url=http://centralpark.org/index.php/attractions-h-w/turtle-pond/ |publisher=CentralPark.org |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was the centerpiece of the Conservancy's three-year ''Wonder of New York Campaign'', which raised $71.5 million and also helped restore southern and westside landscapes, as well as the North Meadow. The Great Lawn project was completed in 1997, featuring new amenities to encourage passive and active recreation as well as nature appreciation.

Citywide budget cuts in the early 1990s, however, resulted in attrition of the park's routine maintenance staff, and the conservancy began hiring staff to replace these workers. Management of the restored landscapes by the conservancy's "zone gardeners" proved so successful that core maintenance and operations staff were reorganized in 1996. The zone-based system of management was implemented throughout the park, which was divided into 49 zones. Zone gardeners supervise volunteers assigned to them; these volunteers commit to a consistent work schedule and are supported by specialized crews in areas of maintenance requiring specific expertise or equipment, or more effectively conducted on a park-wide basis. In 2007, there were 3,000 volunteers compared to just under 250 paid workers in the park.&lt;ref name="centralparknyc history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blonsky, Douglas Op-Ed"/&gt;

Renovations continued through the early 2000s. In 2000 the [[Conservatory Water]] opened after a six-month restoration effort, with a $4 million project beginning on the 59th Street Pond, one of the park's most visible and heavily used landscapes. A new Reservoir fence was installed in 2003 under a $2 million capital project that replaced the old chain-link fence with a replica of the 8,000-foot long steel and cast-iron one that had enclosed the Reservoir in 1926. The new fence, along with removal of invasive trees and shrubs, restored the panoramic views of the park and Manhattan skyline.

Another ambitious restoration effort began in 2004, when Conservancy staff and contractors worked together to refurbish the 15,876 Minton tiles that hang on the ceiling of the Bethesda Arcade. Originally designed by Calvert Vaux and [[Jacob Wrey Mould]], the ceiling of the Arcade is lined by 15,876 elaborately patterned [[encaustic tile]]s. Made by [[Mintons|Minton and Company]], a leading 19th-century ceramic manufacturer in England, the ceiling tiles are divided into 49 panels, each containing 324 tiles. Salt and water infiltration from the roadway above had badly damaged the tiles, leaving their backing plates so corroded they had to be removed in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy and Ottavino 1986 and {{Cite journal |last1=Champe |first1=Peter |last2=Rabinowitz |first2=Mark |title=Restoring the Minton Tile Ceiling, Bethesda Terrace Arcade, Central Park, New York City |journal=[[APT Bulletin]] |volume=30 |issue=2-3 |date=1999 |pages=11-16 |doi=10.2307/1504635 |jstor=1504635}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tiles sat in storage for more than 20 years until the Conservancy received a generous private donation for their restoration. The Conservancy embarked on a $7 million restoration effort to return the Minton tiles to their original luster in 2004. A team of seven conservation technicians cleaned and repaired more than 14,000 original tiles by hand. Only three panels of replica tiles were needed to replace those that had been damaged beyond repair. For those recreations, the Conservancy decided to commission Maw and Company, Minton's successor in Stoke-on-Trent, England. The completed Bethesda Terrace Arcade was unveiled to much fanfare in March 2007. In 2006, the Conservancy completed a nine-month renovation of the Mall in a project that returned the landscape to its original character and ensured the protection of its great American Elms.

[[The Ramble and Lake|The Lake]] was the last of Central Park's bodies of water to be renovated by the Central Park Conservancy, in a project to enhance both its ecological&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Its increasing significance as a wildlife habitat" was noted on the Conservancy's on-site information boards.&lt;/ref&gt; and scenic aspects. In the summer of 2007, the first phase of a restoration of the Lake and its shoreline plantings commenced, with replanting using native shrubs and understory trees around the northern end of the Lake, from Bank Rock Bay&amp;nbsp;– a narrow cove in the northwest corner that had become a silted-up algae-covered stand of aggressively invasive ''[[Phragmites]]'' reeds&amp;nbsp;– to [[Bow Bridge (Central Park)|Bow Bridge]], which received replicas of its four original Italianate cast-iron vases, overspilling with annuals. In the earliest stages, invasive non-native plants like [[Japanese knotweed]] were eradicated, the slopes were regraded with added humus and protected with landscaping burlap to stabilize the slopes while root systems became established and leaf litter developed.

During the same time, Bank Rock Bridge, also called Cabinet Bridge, across the mouth of the cove was recreated in carved oak with cast-iron panels and pine decking, its original materials, following Vaux's original design of 1859–60.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centralpark2000.com/database/bank_rock_br.html The former replacement bridge with utilitarian spiked steel pipe handrails].&lt;/ref&gt; The cascade, where the Gill empties into the lake, was reconstructed to approximate its dramatic original form, inspired by paintings of [[Asher B. Durand]]. Sections of the Lake were dredged of accumulated silt&amp;nbsp;– topsoil that had washed off the surrounding slopes&amp;nbsp;– and the island formerly in the lake, which gradually eroded below water level, was reconstructed in the summer of 2007 with rugged boulders along its shoreline, graded wetland areas, and submerged planting shelves for water-loving native plants, like [[Pickerel weed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centralparknyc.org/site/DocServer/CampaignPressRelease.pdf?docID=143 Central Park Conservancy press release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003070133/http://www.centralparknyc.org/site/DocServer/CampaignPressRelease.pdf?docID=143 |date=October 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oak Bridge, the major entrance to the Ramble from the [[Upper West Side]], spans Bank Rock Bay in the Lake's northwest corner; the long-lost picturesque feature was recreated in 2009 based on Calvert Vaux's original drawings. The bridge, built in 1860 of white oak with decorative openwork panels of cast iron, has been recreated in steel clad in ornamental cast iron facings, with wooden deck and railings. Restoration of further sections of the Lake's shoreline landscapes was undertaken, and the first renovated sections were opened to visitors in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Central Park Conservancy]] | title=Oak Bridge at Bank Rock Bay | website=The Official Website of Central Park NYC | date=February 12, 2015 | url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/oak-bridge.html | access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, there has been a grassroots campaign to restore the park's [[#Vertical drives|loop drives]] to their original [[car-free zones|car-free]] state. Over the years, the number of car-free hours increased, though a full closure was resisted by the [[New York City Department of Transportation]].

Much of the first statuary placed was of authors and poets, in an area now known as Literary Walk. Some of the sculptures are:
* ''[[List of sculptures in Central Park#Fictional characters|Alice in Wonderland Margaret Delacorte Memorial]]'' (1959), a sculpture of [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice]] by sculptor José de Creeft, landscape architect Hideo Sasaki, and designer Ferando Texidor at the Central Park Conservatory Pond
* ''[[List of sculptures in Central Park#Other sculptures|Angel of the Waters]]'' at [[Bethesda Terrace]] by [[Emma Stebbins]] (1873), the first large public sculpture commission for an American woman
* ''[[List of sculptures in Central Park#Animals|Balto]]'' (1925), a statue of [[Balto]], the sled dog who became famous during the [[1925 serum run to Nome]]
* ''[[List of sculptures in Central Park#Complete list|Duke Ellington Memorial]]'' (dedicated in 1997), by sculptor [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]], near Fifth Avenue and 110th Street, in the [[Duke Ellington Circle]]
* ''[[King Jagiello Monument]]'', a bronze monument on the east end of [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond, Central Park|Turtle Pond]]

* '''[[Cleopatra's Needle (New York City)|Cleopatra's Needle]]''' is a red [[granite]] [[obelisk]]. The "Cleopatra's Needle" in Central Park is one of three; there also is one in Paris and one in London. Each obelisk is approximately 68–69 feet tall and weigh about 180 tons. They originally were erected at the Temple of [[Ra]] in [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] in [[Ancient Egypt]] around 1450 BC by the [[Pharaoh]] [[Thutmose III]]. The [[hieroglyph]]s were inscribed about two hundred years later by Pharaoh [[Rameses II]] to glorify his military victories. The obelisks were all moved during the reign of Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]] when [[Ancient Egypt]] was under the control of Rome. They were brought to [[Alexandria]] and erected as tribute to [[Julius Caesar]], in front of the [[Caesarium]], a temple originally built by [[Cleopatra VII]] of Egypt in honor of [[Mark Antony]], thus the name "Cleopatra's Needle".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Leslie's New York journal, Volumes 1-2 p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;{{paragraph}} There are two versions of how the Central Park Cleopatra's Needle made its way to Central Park: either it was a gift from the Khedive of Egypt, [[Isma'il Pasha]], or it was stolen through the machinations of [[William H. Vanderbilt]] who paid the tab to have the obelisk shipped to New York and erected. The obelisk arrived in New York in July 1880; it took thirty-two horses hitched in sixteen pairs to pull the obelisk to the park. It was erected in an official ceremony on January 22, 1881.
* '''[[Strawberry Fields (memorial)|Strawberry Fields]]''': On October 9, 1985, on what would have been [[John Lennon]]'s 45th birthday, New York City dedicated {{convert|2.5|acres|1|abbr=off}} to his memory. Countries from all around the world contributed trees, and Italy donated the iconic "Imagine" mosaic. It has since become the site of impromptu memorial gatherings for other notables, and in the days following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], candlelight vigils were held there.
* '''''[[The Gates]]''''': For sixteen days in 2005 (February 12–27), Central Park was the setting for [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]'s installation ''The Gates''.&lt;ref&gt;''Christo and Jeanne-Claude, The Gates: Central Park, New York City, 1979–2005'', {{ISBN|3-8228-4242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the project was the subject of mixed reactions (and it took many years for Christo and Jeanne-Claude to get the necessary approvals), it was nevertheless a major, if temporary, draw for the park.&lt;ref&gt;February 25, 2005 CNN story about Christo and Jeanne-Claude's The Gates [http://www.cnn.com/2005/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/25/gates.closing/ ''Central Park's 'Gates' to close'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rat Rock pinacle jeh.jpg|thumb|Congregating at the top of Rat Rock]]
There are four different types of [[bedrock]] in Manhattan. In Central Park, [[Manhattan schist]] and Hartland schist, which are both metamorphosed [[sedimentary rock]], are exposed in various outcroppings. The other two types, [[Fordham gneiss]] (an older deeper layer) and [[Inwood marble]] (metamorphosed [[limestone]] which overlays the [[gneiss]]), do not surface in the park.&lt;ref&gt;City at the water's edge: a natural history of New York By Betsy McCully p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Fordham gneiss, which consists of metamorphosed [[igneous rock]]s, was formed a billion years ago, during the [[Grenville orogeny]] that occurred during the creation of an ancient super-continent. It is the oldest rock in the [[Canadian Shield]], the most ancient part of the North American [[tectonic plate]]. Manhattan schist and Hartland schist were formed in the [[Iapetus Ocean]] during the [[Taconic orogeny]] in the [[Paleozoic]] era, about 450 million years ago. During this period the tectonic plates began to move toward each other, which resulted in the creation of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]].&lt;ref&gt;Deformational History of Manhattan Rocks and Its Relationship with the State of In-situ Stress in New York City [http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2004NE/finalprogram/abstract_70544.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cameron's Line]] is a [[fault zone]] that traverses Central Park on an east-west axis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukelabs.com/Abstracts%20and%20Papers/CMMMM2004.htm "Geology of Central Park – From Rocks to Ice" by Charles Merguerian and Mickey Merguerian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228171311/http://dukelabs.com/Abstracts%20and%20Papers/CMMMM2004.htm |date=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various glaciers have covered the area of Central Park in the past, with the most recent being the [[Wisconsinan glaciation|Wisconsin glacier]] which receded about 12,000 years ago. Evidence of past glaciers are visible throughout the park in the form of ''[[glacial erratic]]s'' (large boulders dropped by the receding glacier) and north-south glacial striations visible on stone outcroppings.

====Lakes====
[[File:Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir.jpg|thumb|The [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir]]]]
Central Park is home to seven bodies of water, all artificial. The largest lake is the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir]], so named since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/central-park-reservoir-fountain-is-given-life-again/ ''The New York Times'' report] by Diane Cardwell, July 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed between 1858 and 1862. Covering an area of {{convert|106|acre}} between 86th and 96th Streets, the reservoir reaches a depth of more than {{convert|40|ft}} in places and contains about {{convert|1|e9usgal|e9l|abbr=off}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/reservoir.html?_ga=1.87685144.1637375115.1415715369 www.centralparknyc.org] The Reservoir article&lt;/ref&gt; The Reservoir is best known to New Yorkers for the jogging track around it.

[[The Ramble and Lake]] south of the [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond|Great Lawn]] covers nearly {{convert|18|acre}}.

Central Park is home to over 25,000 trees and has a stand of 1,700 [[American elm]]s, one of the largest remaining stands in the [[northeastern U.S.]], protected by their isolation from the [[Dutch elm disease]] that devastated the tree throughout its native range.

&lt;/ref&gt; Over the decades the list has been updated and changed.{{paragraph}}The park is frequented by various migratory birds during their spring and fall migration on the [[Atlantic Flyway]]. Over a quarter of all the bird species found in the United States have been seen in Central Park. One of these species is the [[red-tailed hawk]], which re-established a presence in the park when a male hawk known as [[Pale Male]] for his light coloration, nested on a building on Fifth Avenue, across the street from the park in 1991. He became a local media celebrity and a prolific breeder.{{paragraph}} Central Park was the site of the misguided unleashing of [[European starling]]s in North America, a native of [[Eurasia]] which has become an [[invasive species]]. In April 1890, eighty birds were released by [[Eugene Schieffelin]] and the following March another eighty; these one hundred and sixty birds are the [[progenitor]]s of the flocks which now span the United States and parts of Canada.
* '''Mammals''':
** [[Raccoon]]s have become extremely common in Central Park in recent years, prompting the Parks Department to post rabies warnings around certain areas.
** [[Eastern gray squirrel]], or grey squirrel
** [[Eastern chipmunk]]: although not commonly sighted, there are chipmunks in Central Park.
** [[Virginia opossum]]

A wooded section of the park, called [[the Ramble and Lake]], is popular among birders. Many species of woodland birds, especially warblers, may be seen in the Ramble in the spring and the fall.

Rowboats and kayaks are rented on an hourly basis at the Loeb Boathouse, which also houses a restaurant overlooking the Lake.

Park Drive, just over {{convert|6|mi|km}} long, is heavily used by runners, joggers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and inline skaters.

On most weekends, running races take place in the park, many of which are organized by the [[New York Road Runners]]. The [[New York City Marathon]] finishes in Central Park outside [[Tavern on the Green]]. Many other professional races are run in the park, including the 2008 USA Men's 8k Championships. [[Baseball field]]s are numerous, and there are also courts for [[beach volleyball|volleyball]], [[tennis]], [[croquet]] and [[lawn bowling]]. The park is home to several competitive running clubs, including Central Park Track Club.

Central Park has two [[ice skating]] rinks, [[Wollman Rink]] and [[Lasker Rink]]; during summer, the former is the site of [[Victorian Gardens]] seasonal amusement park, and the latter converts to an outdoor swimming pool.

Central Park's [[glaciated rock]] outcroppings attract climbers, especially [[bouldering|boulderers]]. The two most renowned spots for boulderers are Rat Rock and Cat Rock; others include Dog Rock, Duck Rock, Rock N' Roll Rock, and Beaver Rock, near the south end of the park.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S.

===Attractions===
[[File:CP Carousel spring jeh.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|[[Central Park Carousel]]]]
Central Park has twenty-one playgrounds for children located throughout the park; the largest, at {{convert|3|acre|m2}}, is Heckscher Playground named for [[August Heckscher]]. The current [[Central Park Carousel]], installed in 1951, is one of the largest merry-go-rounds in the United States. The fifty-eight hand-carved horses and two chariots were made by Solomon Stein and Harry Goldstein in 1908. The carousel originally was installed in [[Coney Island]] in Brooklyn.

The [[Central Park Zoo]] is part of a system of four zoos and one aquarium that is managed by the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]]. The zoo is home to an indoor [[rainforest]], a [[leafcutter ant]] colony, a chilled penguin house, and a [[polar bear]] pool.

[[Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre]] is located in the Swedish Cottage. The building was originally a model schoolhouse built in Sweden. Made of native pine and cedar, it was disassembled and rebuilt in the U.S. as Sweden's exhibit for the [[1876 Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia. Frederick Law Olmsted moved the cottage to its present site in 1877.

===Restaurants===
[[File:Tavern on the Green cloudy jeh.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.1|[[Tavern on the Green]] was originally built in the era of [[Tammany Hall]] to house Central Park's sheep]]

Central Park is home to two indoor restaurants.
The famed New York City restaurant [[Tavern on the Green]] is located on the park's grounds at [[Central Park West]] and West 67th Street. It was originally the sheepfold that housed the sheep that grazed Sheep Meadow, built to a design by Calvert Vaux in 1870. It became a restaurant as part of a 1934 renovation of the park under Robert Moses. In 1974, [[Warner LeRoy]] took over the restaurant's lease and reopened it in 1976 after $10 million in renovations including the addition of a glass-enclosed Crystal Room overlooking the restaurant's garden (one of several dining rooms), which doubled the seating capacity to 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tavern deal not Crystal Clear |first=Steve |last=[[Steve Cuozzo|Cuozzo]] | url= http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/realestate/commercial/tavern_deal_not_crystal_clear_TXN7SjuFfo9ibfJ7SknBoI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME= |newspaper=New York Post |date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant closed in 2009 and reopened on April 24, 2014, after a renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/tavern-green-open-april-24-dinner-article-1.1743113 |title=Tavern on the Green to open April 24 for dinner; to add brunch, lunch in May|work=NY Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Loeb Boathouse restaurant is the other indoor restaurant in Central Park. Located at the Loeb Boathouse on The Lake, it was designed in 1874, destroyed in 1950, and rebuilt in 1954 on the East Side between 74th and 75th Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Central Park Conservancy]] | title=Loeb Boathouse | website=The Official Website of Central Park NYC | url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/loeb-boathouse.html | access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entertainment===

The oldest free classical music concert series in the United States, the [http://www.naumburgconcerts.org/ Naumburg Orchestral Concerts]&amp;nbsp;– founded in [[Elkan Naumburg|1905]]&amp;nbsp;– presents concerts in the park's only neo-classical building, the [[Elkan Naumburg|Naumburg Bandshell on the Concert Ground]], each summer. The concerts feature promising new talent and promote the professional development of young composers and conductors.
[[File:SS Venue and Crowd.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1|[[Summerstage]] features free musical concerts throughout the summer]]

Central Park has given birth to other arts groups dedicated to performing in the park, notably [[Central Park Brass]], which performs an annual concert series, and the [[New York Classical Theatre]], which produces an annual series of plays.

Each summer, there are several events happening in the park. [[The Public Theater]] presents free open-air theatre productions, often starring well-known stage and screen actors. The [[Delacorte Theater]] is the summer performing venue of the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]], where most, although not all, of the plays presented are by [[William Shakespeare]], and the performances are generally regarded as being of high quality since its founding by [[Joseph Papp]] in 1962. The [[New York Philharmonic]] gives an open-air concert on the Great Lawn yearly during the summer. City Parks Foundation has offered Central Park [[Summerstage]] since 1985, a series of free performances including music, dance, spoken word, and film presentations, often featuring famous performers; the Summerstage facility also has non-free concerts that are branded under different names. Since 1992, local singer-songwriter [[David Ippolito]] has performed almost every summer weekend to large crowds of passers-by and regulars and has become a New York icon, often simply referred to as "That guitar man from Central Park". From 1967 until 2007, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] presented two operas in concert each year. The Fifth Avenue Mile is along the east side of the park between 80th and 60th Streets each September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Gretschel | first=Johanna | title=Jenny Simpson Aims For Sixth Title, Course Record At 5th Avenue Mile | website=FloTrack | date=October 5, 2017 | url=http://www.flotrack.org/article/61403-jenny-simpson-aims-for-sixth-title-course-record-at-5th-avenue-mile | access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular one-time concerts have been given in the park including [[Barbra Streisand]], 1967; [[The Supremes]], 1970; [[Carole King]], 1973; [[Bob Marley and The Wailers]], 1975; [[America (band)|America]], 1979; [[Elton John]], 1980; the [[The Concert in Central Park|Simon and Garfunkel reunion]], 1981; [[Diana Ross]], 1983; [[Paul Simon's Concert in the Park|Paul Simon]], 1991; [[Garth Brooks]], 1997; [[Sheryl Crow]], 1999; [[Dave Matthews Band]], 2003; [[Bon Jovi]], 2008;&lt;ref&gt;For the Bon Jovi concert, July 12, 2008, 60,000 free tickets were distributed by the city; a large section of Central Park was closed to the non-ticketed public.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Concerto: One Night in Central Park|Andrea Bocelli]], 2011. Central Park was the location of the largest concert ever on record when [[Country music|country]] superstar [[Garth Brooks]] performed a [[Garth: Live from Central Park|free concert]] in August 1997, to which about 980,000 had attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garth Brooks: The Entertainer |url=http://garthbrooks.com/dialup/index.cfm?id=3&amp;discoID=22 |website=garthbrooks.com |accessdate=February 14, 2010 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103102628/http://garthbrooks.com/dialup/index.cfm?id=3&amp;discoID=22 |archive-date=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==

===Public transport===
The [[New York City Subway]]'s [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Eighth center}}) runs along the western edge of the park, with a transfer station to the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]] at [[59th Street–Columbus Circle (New York City Subway)|Columbus Circle]]. In addition, the [[IRT Lenox Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Lenox south}}) has a station at [[Central Park North–110th Street (IRT Lenox Avenue Line)|Central Park North]]. From there the line curves southwest under the park, and heads west under 104th Street. The [[BMT Broadway Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway 60th}}) has a station at [[Fifth Avenue–59th Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Fifth Avenue and 59th Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NYCS const|map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various bus routes pass through Central Park or stop along its boundaries. The [[M10 and M20 buses|M10]] bus stops along Central Park West, while the [[M5 (New York City bus)|M5]] and part of the [[M7 (New York City bus)|M7]] runs along Central Park South, and the {{NYC bus link|M2|M3|M4|prose=y}} run along Central Park North. The [[M1 (New York City bus)|M1]], M2, M3, and M4 run southbound along Fifth Avenue with corresponding northbound bus service on Madison Avenue. In addition, the {{NYC bus link|M66|M72|M79 SBS|M86 SBS|M96|M106|prose=y}} buses use the transverse roads across Central Park. The {{NYC bus link|M12|M20|M104|prose=y}} only serve Columbus Circle on the south end of the park, and the {{NYC bus link|M31|M57|prose=y}} run on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] two blocks from the park's south end, but do not actually stop on the boundaries of the park itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NYC bus map|M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roads===
Central Park is surrounded by four roadways: [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Central Park North]], [[59th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park South]], [[110th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park West]], and [[Fifth Avenue]]. There are four plazas, one on each corner of the park: [[Frederick Douglass Circle]] on the northwest, [[Duke Ellington Circle]] on the northeast, [[Columbus Circle]] at the southwest, and [[Grand Army Plaza (Manhattan)|Grand Army Plaza]] at the southeast. There are also four transverse roadways: [[66th Street (Manhattan)|65th–66th Streets]], [[79th Street (Manhattan)|79th–81st Streets]], [[86th Street (Manhattan)|86th Street]], and [[96th Street (Manhattan)|96th Street]]. The park has three scenic roadways that travel it vertically: West, Center, and East Drives. Since 2018, traffic is banned from all of the vertical drives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Vertical drives====
[[File:Central Park New York May 2015 005.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|West Drive in Central Park]]
{{vanchor|West Drive}} is the westernmost of the park's three vertical "drives". The road, which carries southbound bicycle and horse-carriage traffic, is described as "... concealed in sunken roadways and screened with densely planted shrub belts, creating a country-road feel in the center of the city." In the early 20th century, the drive was a popular place for carriage rides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshutter.com/image/central-park-west-drive-new-york|title=Central Park West Drive 1906}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A painting by [[Gifford Beal]] shows a picture of West Drive depicted with a horse and buggy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dma.org/collection/artwork/gifford-beal/west-drive-central-park|title=West Drive, Central Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the drive is also dangerous; in 2014, a {{convert|0.5|mi|adj=on}} stretch of West Drive was considered to be "the most dangerous section of Central Park" for pedestrians, with bicycle crashes along the drive leaving 15 people injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/01/22/pedestrians-walking-into-bicycle-danger-zones-in-central-park/|title=Pedestrians walking into bicycle danger zones in Central Park|work=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taxis routes Central Park.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Center Drive in Central Park]]
{{vanchor|Center Drive}} (also known as the "Central Park Lower Loop"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2012-09-28-central-park-loop.pdf|title=Central Park Drives: Improvements for Pedestrians &amp; Cyclists}}&lt;/ref&gt;) connects northbound bicycle and carriage traffic from Midtown at West Drive and Sixth Avenue near the 65th Street Transverse. The street generally goes east and then north, forming the bottom part of the Central Park loop. The attractions along this street include the Victorian Gardens Amusement Park, the Central Park Carousel and the Central Park Mall.

{{vanchor|East Drive}}, the easternmost of the three drives, connects northbound bicycle and carriage traffic from Midtown to the Upper West Side at [[Lenox Avenue]]. The street is renowned for its country scenery and free concerts. It generally straddles the east side of the park along Fifth Avenue. The drive passes by the Central Park Zoo around 63rd Street and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] around the 80th to 84th Street area. The drive is also one of the legs of the New York Marathon. It is known as the "[[Elite Carriage Parade]]", because at the time of the park's opening, only 5 percent of the city was able to afford the carriage; of this, [[Walt Whitman]] said that the carriage parade was "an impressive, rich, interminable circus on a grand scale, full of action and color."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2014/06/16/the-daily-carriage-parade-in-1860s-central-park/|title=The elite "carriage parade" in 1860s Central Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drives were formerly two-way traffic, but in November 1929, the scenic drives were converted to unidirectional traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/11/23/archives/oneway-traffic-ordered-for-central-park-new-zone-created-to-relieve.html|title=One-Way Traffic Ordered for Central Park; New Zone Created to Relieve Congestion|date=November 23, 1929|website=The New York Times|access-date=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The improvements were intended to increase pedestrian safety. Prior to the changes, there were large numbers of collisions between pedestrians and vehicles. In the first ten months of 1929, eight people were killed and 249 were injured in 338 separate collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/11/27/archives/park-safety-is-aim-of-oneway-rules-no-intention-to-make-express.html|title=PARK SAFETY IS AIM OF ONE-WAY RULES; No Intention to Make Express Motor Highways of the Drives, Hoyt Explains.

The signals were coordinated so that drivers could go through all of the green lights if they maintained a steady speed of 25 mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/04/01/archives/central-park-uses-new-traffic-lights-today-to-curb-speeding-and.html|title=Central Park Uses New Traffic Lights Today To Curb Speeding and Protect Pedestrians|date=March 1, 1932|website=The New York Times|access-date=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drives were experimentally closed to automotive traffic on weekends starting in 1967, for exclusive use by pedestrians and bicyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/04/17/archives/new-car-ban-set-for-central-park-test-will-give-cyclists-sole-use.html|title=NEW CAR BAN SET FOR CENTRAL PARK; Test Will Give Cyclists Sole Use of Drives on Saturdays|date=April 17, 1967|website=The New York Times|access-date=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, the scenic drives were closed to automotive traffic for most of the day during the summer. By 1979, the drives were only open during rush hours and late evenings during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/08/archives/car-ban-a-spring-ritual-gives-park-roads-to-the-people-central-park.html|title=Car Ban, a Spring Ritual, Gives Park Roads to the People|last=Daniels|first=Lee A.|date=May 8, 1979|website=The New York Times|access-date=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation was proposed in October 2014 to conduct a study to make the park car-free in summer 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2015, Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] announced the permanent closure of West and East Drives north of 72nd Street to vehicular traffic as it was proven that closing the roads did not adversely impact traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150618/upper-west-side/central-park-will-be-permamently-car-free-above-72nd-street-mayor-says|title=Central Park Will Be Permanently Car-Free Above 72nd Street, Mayor Says|author=Emily Frost|date=June 18, 2015|work=DNA Info|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928151120/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150618/upper-west-side/central-park-will-be-permamently-car-free-above-72nd-street-mayor-says|archivedate=September 28, 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After most of the Central Park loop drives were closed to vehicular traffic, the city performed a follow-up study. The city found that West Drive, which was used by 1,050 vehicles a day, was open for two hours during the morning rush hour, and that East Drive, which was open for twelve hours a day, was used by 3,400 vehicles per day.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/nyregion/central-park-car-ban.html|title=Central Park’s Scenic Drives Will Soon Be Car-Free|date=April 20, 2018|website=The New York Times|access-date=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, all cars were banned from East Drive in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ny.curbed.com/2018/1/2/16842086/prospect-park-car-free-2018-photos|title=At last, Prospect Park is permanently car-free|last=Plitt|first=Amy|date=January 2, 2018|website=Curbed NY|access-date=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, de Blasio announced that the entirety of all three loop drives would be permanently closed to traffic.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-centralpark/new-york-banning-cars-from-central-park-starting-this-summer-idUSKBN1HR2SJ|title=New York banning cars from Central Park starting this summer|last=Cherelus|first=Gina|date=April 20, 2018|website=Reuters U.S.|access-date=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closure was placed into effect in June 2018.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Issues==
Central Park was once a very dangerous place, especially after dark, as measured by crime statistics. The park is considerably safer in the 21st century, though during prior periods it was the site of numerous muggings and rapes. Well-publicized incidents of sexual and confiscatory violence, such as the notorious 1989 [[Central Park jogger case]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/wise.pdf |title=Affirmation in Response to Motion to Vacate Judgment of Conviction: The People of the State of New York -against- Kharey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Raymond Santana, Defendants |date=December 5, 2002 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Robert M.

Permission to hold issue-centered rallies in Central Park, similar to the [[Central Park be-ins|be-ins]] of the 1960s, has been met with increasingly stiff resistance from the city. During some [[2004 Republican National Convention protest activity|2004 protests]], the organization [[United for Peace and Justice]] wanted to hold a rally on the Great Lawn during the [[Republican National Convention (2004)|Republican National Convention]]. The city denied application for a permit, stating that such a mass gathering would be harmful to the grass and that such damage would make it harder to collect private donations to maintain the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0825-11.htm |title=Judge Blocks Central Park Protest |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=August 25, 2004 |accessdate=March 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324194946/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0825-11.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts upheld the refusal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/08/24/rnc.protests/|title=Judge blocks RNC protest in Central Park|website=CNN.com|date=August 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s and early 2010s, new towers were constructed along the southern end of Central Park. According to a [[Municipal Art Society]] report, such buildings cast shadows over the southern end of the park. There has been some controversy over this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.org/urbanplanning/accidental-skyline/|title=Accidental Skyline |publisher=MAS.org |date=October 15, 2014 |accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Eugène Bedaux''' (10 October 1886 – 18 February 1944) was a [[France|French]]-born American [[millionaire]] who made his fortune developing and implementing the [[work measurement]] aspect of [[scientific management]], notably the [[Bedaux System]]. Considered one of the most eccentric [[millionaire]]s of the early twentieth century, Bedaux was friends with [[British royalty]] and [[Nazism|Nazis]] alike, and was a [[management consultant]], [[big game hunter]] and [[explorer]].

==Early years==
Charles Bedaux was born in the [[Charenton-le-Pont]] [[commune]] of [[Paris, France]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB&gt;Steven Kreis, 'Charles E. Bedaux' in ''[[American National Biography]]'' [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1000116 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about his early life but his brother Gaston later recorded that in 1903, Charles dropped out of [[Lycée Jean-Baptiste-Say]] in [[Paris]] where he had been studying engineering.

Charles worked a series of menial jobs before befriending Henri Ledoux, a successful [[pimp]] from the infamous [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]] district. The mysterious Ledoux apparently taught Bedaux lessons on proper dress, confidence and street-fighting, but was murdered in 1906.&lt;ref name=Gaston&gt;Gaston Bedaux, ''La Vie Ardente de Charles Bedaux'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

What is verified is that in 1906, Charles moved to the United States, where he became a [[United States citizen]], married, and had a son, Charles Emile Bedaux (1909–1993).&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt; He would later claim in interviews to have worked as a restaurant bottle-washer, a [[sandhog]],&lt;ref&gt;'Duke's Guide Here had Vivid Rise; Industrialist Began as Laborer' ''New York Times'', 24 October 1937. [https://www.nytimes.com/1937/10/24/archives/dukes-guide-here-had-vivid-rise-industrialist-began-as-laborer.html ''New York Times'' online archive]&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[New Jersey]] Worsted Mills in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;

==The Bedaux B==
Bedaux was one of the leading contributors in the field of [[work measurement]] or ''labor measurement'', one strand of the [[scientific management]] movement's influence. In this, he was strongly influenced by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]]'s book ''Shop Management'',&lt;ref&gt;See F.W. Taylor, ''Shop Management'' (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1911). Online at [https://archive.org/details/shopmanagement01tayl Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly Taylor's time study practices, and [[Charles Edward Knoeppel|Charles E. Knoeppel]]'s writings on industrial layout and routing.&lt;ref name=Brech&gt;[[Edward Francis Leopold Brech]], ''Productivity in Perspective, 1914-1974'' (Bristol: Thoemmes Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn&gt;Michael R. Weatherburn, 'Scientific Management at Work: the Bedaux System, Management Consulting, and Worker Efficiency in British Industry, 1914-48' (Imperial College PhD thesis, 2014). {{cite web|url= https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/25296 |title=Download PDF from Imperial College, London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The_Bedaux_company_logo,_featuring_the_"B".jpg|thumb|left|The Bedaux company logo, featuring its distinctive "B" unit]]

Building on these authors, Bedaux introduced the concept of rating assessment, which led to improvements in the comparability of employee and departmental efficiency. He named this the "[[Bedaux System|Bedaux System of Human Power Measurement]]." The distinguishing feature of the Bedaux System, which advanced it beyond these earlier scientific management practitioners, was in its use of the ''[[Bedaux Unit]]'' or ''B'', a universal measure for all manual work.&lt;ref name=Brech /&gt;&lt;ref name=Littler&gt;Craig R. Littler, ''Development of the Labour Process in Capitalist Societies:  a Comparative Study of the Transformation of Work Organization in Britain, Japan and the USA'' (London: Heinemann, 1982) [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_development_of_the_labour_process_in.html?id=2k2yAAAAIAAJ entry on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedaux also mimicked [[Frank Gilbreth]] by introducing a [[time and motion study|motion study]] [[Kodascope]] package which he propagated with an early Bedaux client, [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]].&lt;ref name=KreisThesis&gt;Steven Kreis, 'The Diffusion of an Idea: A History of Scientific Management in Britain, 1890-1945' (PhD thesis, University of Missouri-Columbia, 1990) [http://www.worldcat.org/title/diffusion-of-an-idea-a-history-of-scientific-management-in-britain-1890-1945/oclc/25526850?referer=di&amp;ht=edition entry on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management consultancy==
Bedaux became associated with one of Taylor's circle, [[Harrington Emerson]], whose consultancy, [[Emerson Consulting]],&lt;ref&gt;William F. Muhs, 'The Emerson Engineers: A Look at One of the First Management Consulting Firms in the U.S' ''Academy of Management Proceedings'' Vol. 1986, No. 1 (1986).

E. Bedaux Company.

[[File:Bedaux consultancy advertising booklet (1928).jpg|thumb|Bedaux consultancy advertising booklet (1928)]]

Early U.S. clients were in the furniture assembly and rubber sectors of [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historygrandrapids.org/article/4349/f-stuart-foote-brings-bedaux-t&lt;/ref&gt; His consultancy's slogan was ''Bedaux Measures Labor'' and its logo incorporated an [[egg timer]] motif.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

The Bedaux consultancy was one of the first of its kind and within a decade its success allowed for the creation of a string of consultancy firms across the United States, [[Europe]], and eventually throughout [[Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;Jon Lewis, ''Industrialisation and Trade Union Organisation in South Africa, 1924-55: the Rise and Fall of the South African Trades and Labour Council'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; India,&lt;ref&gt;Rajnarayan Chandavarkar, 'Workers' Resistance and the Rationalization of Work in Bombay Between the Wars' in Douglas E.

Major Bedaux clients included [[DuPont]],&lt;ref&gt;John C. Rumm, 'Scientific Management and Industrial Engineering at Du Pont' in ''A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management Since Taylor'' (1992). {{cite web|url= https://ohiostatepress.org/books/Complete%20PDFs/Nelson%20Mental/09.pdf |title=Link }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imperial Chemical Industries]],&lt;ref name="Link"/&gt; [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later BP)]],&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kipping, 'Consultancy and Conflicts: Bedaux at Lukens

==Labor resistance==
The Bedaux system was introduced at [[Campbell's]] in 1927, where ''B'' standards were 'the cause of the majority of the shop floor battles between management and labor' for years.&lt;ref name="Sidorick"/&gt; In 1929, the [[Taylor Society]] supported Southern textile workers in their [[strike action|strike]] against the Bedaux System, which textile workers believed was 'even worse than the old "Taylor Stop-Watch System"'.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Nadworny, ''Scientific Management and the Unions: 1900- 1932. A Historical Analysis'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a long series of labor disputes in relation to Bedaux and the [[Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen|Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen (4L)]] in the U.S. Northwest lumber industry from 1931-5.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Egolf, 'Labor Control in Crisis: the 4L and the Bedaux System in the U.S. Northwest Lumber Industry, 1931-1935' (University of British Columbia MA thesis, 1980)  {{cite web|url= https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0094679 |title=Link }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bedaux Hell in the 'Daily Worker'.jpg|thumb|A cartoon attacking the Bedaux B in the Daily Worker]]

Bedaux Britain had several labor issues:  in 1929, there was a strike over the Bedaux System at the [[Rover Company|Rover]] plant in [[Coventry]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura Lee Downs, 'Industrial Decline, Rationalization and Equal Pay: The Bedaux Strike at Rover Automobile Company' ''Social History'' Vol. 15, No. 1 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In winter 1931-2, women workers struck over the introduction of the Bedaux System at [[Wolsey (clothing)|Wolsey]] in [[Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/leicester/article_1.shtml 'The Bedaux strike': Oral history study from [[BBC]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selina Todd, ''The People: The Rise and Fall of the Working Class'' (London: John Murray, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 1934 the introduction of the Bedaux System at [[Richard Johnson and Nephew]] in [[Manchester]] precipitated a strike which lasted for months.&lt;ref name=Littler /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mick Jenkins, 'Time and Motion Strike: Manchester 1934-7' ''Our History'' Vol. 60 (Autumn 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the wiredrawers' union took their employers to court over the Bedaux System but eventually lost their case.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

One of Bedaux's principal engagements in Italy was at the iconic [[Fiat]] plant in [[Turin]], whose founder [[Giovanni Agnelli]] was also head of the Società Italiana Bedaux.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Musso /&gt; These management interventions were later made famous by the founder of the [[Italian Communist Party]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], whose ''[[Prison Notebooks]]'' analyzed the ramifications of ''[[Taylorism]]'' at the plant. The Bedaux System also met with resistance at the Pertusola mines in [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Stella Rollandi, ʻIl sistema Bedaux nelle miniere sarde della "Pertusola" (1927-1935)' ''Studi Storici'', No. 26, Vol. 1, (1985), pp. 69-106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minesofsardinia.com/StoriaMiniereIng.php?IdS=12&amp;IdCSM=9&amp;PHPSESSID=&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bedaux Britain Ltd.==

Of Bedaux's business empire, Bedaux Britain was particularly lucrative.&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Littler /&gt;&lt;ref name=KreisThesis /&gt; Here, the [[Bedaux Unit]] was so successful that it was copied by industrial firms such as [[Rowntree's]] of [[York]] (a corporate member of the [[Taylor Society]]), [[Mander Brothers]] of [[Wolverhampton]], and influential consultancies including [[Lyndall Urwick|Urwick, Orr &amp; Partners]].&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

Indeed, Bedaux Britain formed the basis for all four of the 'Big Four' European consultancies in the postwar period: [[Associated Industrial Consultants (AIC)]], [[Lyndall Urwick|Urwick, Orr &amp; Partners (UOP)]], [[Production-Engineering (P-E)]] and [[PA Consulting|PA Consulting (PA)]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Tisdall, ''Agents of Change: The Development and Practice of Management Consultancy'' (London: Heinemann, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kipping, 'Consultancies, Institutions and the Diffusion of Taylorism in Britain, Germany and France, 1920s to 1950s', ''Business History'' (1997) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076799700000146 PDF from Taylor &amp; Francis online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ferguson, ''The Rise of Management Consulting in Britain'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In focusing on factory floor and office efficiency issues, the 'Big Four' Bedauxist consultancies were successful across Western Europe until the 1960s, when they were largely overtaken by U.S. consultancies such as [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], whose efforts were in higher-value activities such as strategy and restructuring.&lt;ref name=mckenna&gt;'Christopher D. McKenna, ''The World's Newest Profession: Management Consulting in the Twentieth Century'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2010).

==The Bedaux Canadian Sub-Arctic Expedition==
The [[Bedaux Expedition|Bedaux Canadian Sub-Arctic Expedition]] was the grand title Bedaux gave to the expedition he formed to cross the wilderness of Northern [[British Columbia]], Canada in 1934. Mostly, the expedition was a [[publicity stunt]], but it was also formed to test out the new [[Citroën]] [[half-track]] cars that were being developed by Bedaux's friend [[André Citroën]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saskatoon Sun |title=Rumours surround legendary Bedaux trek |url=http://www.wdm.ca/wdmbedau.html |accessdate=2007-07-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072236/http://www.wdm.ca/wdmbedau.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historygrandrapids.org/article/4356/bedaux-canadian-subartic-exped&lt;/ref&gt;
Key points in the trip were filmed by [[Academy Award]] winning cinematographer from [[Hollywood]], [[Floyd Crosby]], who would later be praised for his work on ''[[High Noon]]''. Also along for the trip were several dozen [[Alberta]] [[cowboy]]s and a large film crew.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Sherwood, ''Bannock and Beans: A Cowboy's Account of the Bedaux Expedition'' (2009) [http://surveyingbc.ca/bann.htm summary]&lt;/ref&gt; To map the route of the expedition, the Canadian government sent along two geographers, [[Frank Swannell]] and Ernest Lemarque. The expedition started off at [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] on 6 July 1934 and their goal was to travel 1500 miles to [[Telegraph Creek, British Columbia]]. Much of the trip would have to be made through regions that were relatively uncharted and had no trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bob Dyke |title=Bedaux Expedition |url=http://www.fsj.nlc.bc.ca/nlc/sroe/bob_dyke.htm |accessdate=2007-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214225117/http://www.fsj.nlc.bc.ca/nlc/sroe/bob_dyke.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The party failed to reach their destination and the original movie was never made, but in 1995, [[Canadians|Canadian]] director, George Ungar,&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0881089/ George Ungar on [[IMDB]]]&lt;/ref&gt; produced a television biography of Bedaux incorporating Crosby's footage of the expedition, ''[[The Champagne Safari]]'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112657/ ''The Champagne Safari'' (1995) on [[IMDB]] entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vettese |first1=Richard |title=Champagne Safari |url=http://www.historygrandrapids.org/article/4358/champagne-safari |website=History Grand Rapids.org by the Grand Rapids Historical Commission |publisher=Grand Rapids Community Media Center |accessdate=8 August 2018 |location=[[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]], US |language=en-us |date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ChateauCandé-B.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Bedaux hosted the Windsors' wedding in his [[Château de Candé]].]]

==The Duke and Duchess of Windsor==
Bedaux purchased the sixteenth-century [[Château de Candé]], in France, and lived there with his American second wife, the former Fern Lombard (1892–1972), a daughter of lawyer James Lombard of Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt; The couple purchased the château in 1927 and renovated it, completing work in 1930.&lt;ref name="experienceloire.com"&gt;http://www.experienceloire.com/chateau-de-cande.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 1937, Charles and Fern Bedaux hosted the wedding of [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Warfield]] and [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor]] at the château.&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt; Bedaux then arranged the couple's honeymoon to the [[Third Reich]], where they publicly met the [[Führer]], [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;

==The Duke and Duchess's U.S.A. tour==
The next stage of the trip, the United States, was called off due to [[labor union]], press and public outrage at Bedaux's involvement. He was quickly [[demonized]] in the media around the globe. Specifically, the [[Baltimore Federation of Labor]] publicly attacked the 'emissaries of dictatorships or uniformed sentimentalists' and called the [[Bedaux System]] a 'vicious adaptation of the [[Taylor System]]'.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

From then on, commentators conceptually linked Bedaux and his ''B'' system with [[fascism]], and Taylor's remaining supporters, particularly those in the [[Taylor Society]], distanced themselves from Bedaux.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

The fiasco prompted many employers using the Bedaux System, and those derived from it, to change its terminology to more neutral and administrative language.&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sidorick"/&gt; This goes some way to explain why historical research into the enduring influence of the Bedaux System and its [[Bedaux Unit]] has been reported as difficult to undertake.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Littler, 'The Bureaucratization of the Shop-Floor: the Development of Modern Work Systems' (PhD thesis, London School of Economics, 1980), Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War activity==
When Paris was occupied by the [[Germans]] during [[World War II]], Bedaux became acquainted with leading Nazi and [[Vichy France|Vichy]] figures. After the fall of France in 1940, he was appointed as an economic advisor to Vichy and the [[Reich]].

Bedaux's wife, Fern, and her sister, Eve Duez (Mme Louis S Duez), were interned briefly in Paris during the war but were soon released through their connections to the German government in France.&lt;ref&gt;"My attention was drawn to a woman who was sitting on the edge of a cot with an ermine wrap around her feet. She was passing around a five-pound box of chocolates to her friends. I learned that she was Mrs. Charles Bedaux, at whose chateau the Duke of Windsor married Mrs. Simpson. Mrs. Bedaux said in a very loud voice that she did not expect to be with us long, and that she was waiting for Otto Abetz, Nazi fifth columnist in France before the war and the new Nazi Ambassador to France, to come and get her and her sister released. Next morning a group of French collaborationists, obviously personages high in treachery, arrived with an important German in uniform. They were very respectful to Mrs. Bedaux, helped her pack her things, and out she swept, while the rest of us were enraged at this exhibition of the power of social and political influence." From '' The House Near Paris: An American Woman's Story of Traffic in Patriots'' by Drue Tartière and M R Werner, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1946, page 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Bedaux experimented with a political-economic system of his own invention, ''Equivalism'', in [[Roquefort]], [[Vichy France]]. Recent research has shown that the experiments amounted to tinkering which locals hardly noticed.&lt;ref name=LevantNikitin&gt;Yves Levant &amp; Marc Nikitin, 'Charles Eugène Bedaux (1886–1944): ‘cost killer’ or Utopian Socialist?' ''Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History'' (2009) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09585200902969278 Taylor &amp; Francis online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1941, in France, there was a violent coal strike over the [[Bedaux System]] in the Nord and Pas de Calais in May and June.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vinen, 'The French Coal Industry during the Occupation' ''The Historical Journal'' Vol. 33, No. 1 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedaux's German connections were not restricted to Occupied France. In October 1941 he was designated by the sabotage branch of the [[Abwehr]] (Abwehr II) to command a covert mission to [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]) to capture the refinery at [[Abadan]] from his former client, the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]], and protect it from Allied bombardment prior to a planned German military invasion of [[Iraq]] and Persia.&lt;ref&gt;The sheer scale of such an operation would have been enormous, especially since Bedaux contemplated the “sanding-up” (and subsequent “de-sanding”) of not only the Abadan refinery, but also the [[Mosul]] oilfield, as well as the 483&amp;nbsp;km of pipeline between them, not to mention other infrastructure in southwestern Persia. The proposal was indeed first regarded by the Abwehr planners as a “fantastic” plan, and it looked as if it would not gain acceptance. However, Bedaux persisted and succeeded in getting the plan submitted to a panel of experts who, after meticulous examination, pronounced it technically feasible. The scheme was ultimately cancelled by the Abwehr for various reasons. Those that concerned Bedaux himself were: (1) his expertise was confined strictly to his 1938 survey of the refinery, and he knew even less about Persia than the Persians knew about him; (2) Bedaux's age, poor health, lack of military training and experience, lack of petroleum-engineering qualifications, and inability to speak either [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[German language|German]] made him a poor choice as commander; (3) Bedaux's inappropriate, grandiose demands, such as being given the full rank of general.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1942, however, strategic events (e.g. the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]) had rendered the operation unworkable, and Bedaux was dropped by [[Berlin]]. The countersabotage plan then became obsolete,&lt;ref name="o'sullivan"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Sullivan|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian O'Sullivan|title=German Covert Initiatives and British Intelligence in Persia (Iran), 1939-1945 ([[Doctor of Literature and Philosophy|DLitt et Phil]] dissertation)|publisher=UNISA|location=Pretoria|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it looked suspicious when Bedaux was later investigated by the [[FBI]] and [[MI5]].&lt;ref name=Weatherburn/&gt;

Despite Bedaux's cultivation of relationships with various [[Abwehr]] and [[Nazi Party]] officials, declassified [[National Archives and Records Administration]] records indicate that Bedaux did not have dealings with the upper echelons of the Party or with officials of the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SS Security Service).&lt;ref name=Weatherburn/&gt;&lt;ref name="o'sullivan"/&gt;

==Bedaux's arrest and suicide==
On 13 January 1943 Bedaux was in [[Algeria]] allegedly supervising the construction of a [[Germany|German]] [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] when he and his son were arrested by the Americans. He was kept in custody without charge for a year.&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt; Bedaux was eventually flown to the [[US]], and, awaiting charges of [[trading with the enemy]] and [[treason]], committed [[suicide]] using an [[overdose]] of [[barbiturates]] while in [[FBI]] custody in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Littler /&gt;&lt;ref name="o'sullivan"/&gt; His death featured prominently in the contemporary media,&lt;ref name=NYTimesMystery&gt;'Bedaux Legendary as Mystery Man' ''New York Times'', 20 February 1944 [https://www.nytimes.com/1944/02/20/archives/bedaux-legendary-as-mystery-man-one-of-group-credited-with.html ''New York Times'' online archive]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly an influential [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] biographical trilogy by [[Janet Flanner]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Littler /&gt;&lt;ref name=mckenna /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brenda Wineapple]], ''Genêt: A Biography of Janet Flanner'' (1992) [http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Gen%C3%AAt,672627.aspx University of Nebraska Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Flanner attacked the [[Bedaux System]] and [[Bedaux Unit]] as, despite Bedaux's verbose claims to originality, she argued that they did not differ 'much from the old [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] shop-management system of the nineties'.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

==Posthumous reputation==
The circumstances of Bedaux's death and his posthumous influence remain subjects of research inquiry.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Littler /&gt;&lt;ref name=mckenna /&gt;&lt;ref name="o'sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimesMystery"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://historyguide.org/author1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his contemporary prominence in the media, and in business and consultancy circles, Bedaux did not feature alongside such figures as [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]], [[Hans Renold]] and [[Charles Samuel Myers|Charles Myers]] in the ''[[Making of Scientific Management]]'' trilogy by [[Lyndall Urwick]] and [[Edward Franz Leopold Brech|E.F.L. Brech]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyndall Urwick and E.F.L. Brech, ''The Making of Scientific Management II: Management in British Industry'' (London: Management Publications Trust, 1949) [https://archive.org/details/makingofscientif029853mbp available at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also not present in Urwick's comprehensive management [[prosopography]] ''The Golden Book of Management''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyndall Urwick]], ''The Golden Book of Management: A Historical Record of the Life and Work of Seventy Pioneers'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt; It remains controversial as to why.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref name=KreisThesis /&gt;&lt;ref name=mckenna /&gt;

It has also been suggested that, in an attempt to restore Bedaux's reputation, the French government awarded Bedaux a posthumous [[Légion d'honneur]] on the grounds that he had actually hampered the Germans and guarded Jewish property.&lt;ref name=Gaston /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebba|first=Anne|authorlink=Anne Sebba|year=2011|title=That Woman: the Life of Wallis Simpson, Duchess of Windsor|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-85896-6|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has been unable to prove the existence of this award.&lt;ref name=LevantNikitin /&gt;

A street in Tours, the Avenue Charles Bedaux, is named after Bedaux.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Avenue+Charles+Bedaux,+37000+Tours,+France/@47.376769,0.6693022,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47fcd5e67856f60b:0x89410e1c46d7c3fd!8m2!3d47.376769!4d0.6714909&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Bedaux (1886-1944) grave.png|thumb|Charles Bedaux (1886-1944) grave]]

The [[Château de Candé]] is open to public visitors and is themed around the Duke and Duchess's 1937 wedding. Many of Bedaux's possessions are on display there.&lt;ref name="experienceloire.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.francetoday.com/travel/travel-features/chateau-de-cande-wedding-wallis-simpson-edward-viii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bedaux in popular culture==
Bedaux's most famous [[depiction]] in interwar culture was as a crackpot inventor in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' who presents a 'Beddoes' or 'Billowes' 'Feeding Machine' to Chaplin's employer. The malfunctioning contraption was then demonstrated on a restrained and tormented Chaplin.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro F. Guillén, ''Models of Management: Work, Authority, and Organization in a Comparative Perspective'' (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the 'Bedaux belt' featured in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Inside the Whale]]'', alongside other items and people, such as [[Hitler]] and [[Stalin]], which Orwell saw as indicative of the dark side of the period.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

Following his death in 1944, Bedaux features by name in [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1945 novel [[Dragon Harvest]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=OeQlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT40&amp;dq=Bedaux+upton+sinclair&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Bedaux%20upton%20sinclair&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedaux also appears as a thwarted [[Business process reengineering|efficiency expert]], Monsieur Bedou of Ratio Ltd., in [[Pierre Boulle]]'s ''Sacrilege in Malaya'' (1951).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prrb.ca/issues/prrb-issue06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
Several [[conspiracy theories]] surround Bedaux's life and death. They usually situate Bedaux as a conduit between the [[Nazi]] and British elites, who facilitated important events in [[World War Two]] such as the [[fall of France]] and the alleged [[murder]] of [[Heinrich Himmler]] by British intelligence operatives.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Allen, ''Hidden Agenda: How the Duke of Windsor Betrayed the Allies'' (London: Macmillan, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Allen, ''The Hitler/Hess Deception: British Intelligence's Best-Kept Secret of the Second World War'' (London: HarperCollins, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Allen, ''Himmler's Secret War: the Covert Peace Negotiations of Heinrich Himmler'' (London: Robson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  These stories stem both from contemporary [[sensationalist]] media stories following Bedaux's well-publicised suicide&lt;ref name=NYTimesMystery /&gt; and in publications which followed the [[FBI]]'s release of the Bedaux files in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Allen, ''The Crown and the Swastika: Hitler, Hess, and the Duke of Windsor'' (London: Hale, 1983) [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_crown_and_the_swastika.html?id=MZ0gAAAAMAAJ Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Higham, ''Trading with the Enemy: an Exposé of the Nazi-American Money Plot 1933-1949'' (London: Hale, 1983) [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/682306.Trading_With_The_Enemy Goodreads]&lt;/ref&gt; These claims have been subject to recent investigation.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haiger, 'Fiction, Facts, and Forgeries: the “Revelations” of Peter and Martin Allen about the History of the Second World War' ''Journal of Intelligence History'' Vol. 6 (2006) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16161262.2006.10555127 ''Journal of Intelligence History'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C16525&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2008 this issue was compounded by the discovery that key elements of Martin Allen's ''Hidden Agenda'' trilogy were based on twenty-nine forgeries located in the [[UK National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Fenton, 'Lies And Secrets' ''Financial Times'', 3 May 2008 [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f3a43fbc-18ab-11dd-8c92-0000779fd2ac.html?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true#axzz4DfPdTiIX ''Financial Times'' online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The 29 Fakes Behind a Rewriting of History' ''The Guardian'', 5 May 2008 [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/05/nationalarchives.secondworldwar ''The Guardian'' online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Forgeries revealed in the National Archives' ''The Sunday Times'', 4 May 2008 [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article90536.ece ''The Sunday Times'' online]&lt;/ref&gt; These forged papers explicitly implicated Bedaux high in the elite echelons of the [[Third Reich]]. As part of the police investigation into the case, Allen denied knowledge of the forgeries and 'suggested he was the victim of a conspiracy'.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Fenton, 'Himmler Forgeries in National Archives Case will Stay Unsolved' ''Financial Times'' 3 May 2008 [http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100309134935/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/371bb7fe-18aa-11dd-8c92-0000779fd2ac.html ''Financial Times'' online]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Cleveland Dodge''' (September 16, 1841 &amp;ndash; November 4, 1910) was a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[American Civil War]] and one of the youngest in history, receiving his commission at the age of twenty-one. He was the son of Congressman [[William Earle Dodge]].

==American Civil War service==
Dodge was commissioned as a captain in the [[1st Regiment New York Mounted Rifles|1st New York Mounted Rifles]], also known as [[7th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry|7th New York Volunteer Cavalry]] in December 1861, and was soon promoted to major. He commanded this cavalry detachment during [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[John E. Wool]]'s Norfolk expedition, Prior to this Major Dodge and the Mounted Rifles participated in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|clash of ironclads]], firing from shore at the [[CSS Virginia]] during said Naval engagement.

After the successful seizure, of [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard|Norfolk &amp; Gosport Naval Yard]], Major Dodge was dispatched to Suffolk on May 12, 1862. This move was to choke off Rebel port and secure roads around the Dismal Swamp. This cut off supplies coming up from [[Carolina Sounds]]. Suffolk had been abandoned by rebel forces who withdrew to the [[Blackwater River (Virginia)|Blackwater River]]. Major Dodge held Suffolk until General Peck was placed in charge and turned Suffolk into a fortress city with 15 miles of defensive works.

Dodge was promoted to the rank of colonel on August 14, 1862, and then to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on November 29, 1862, an advancement that was lobbied for by a number of prominent New Yorkers, including Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;Gerleman, David J. “A Roosevelt, A Dodge, and A. Lincoln," ''Lincoln Editor: The Quarterly Newsletter of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln'', XIV, 2 (April–June 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded successful engagements during the [[Siege of Suffolk|Suffolk Campaign]] and at [[Hertford, North Carolina]]. The mounted Rifles under Dodge served as the eyes and ears for General Peck in numerous sorties. Cavalry men under Dodge were the first to detect the movement of Longstreet that led to the siege of Suffolk by Rebel Forces.

He had performed commendably, but there was obviously difficulties between Dodge and his superior [[Major General]] [[John J. Peck]], and his Corps commander Major General [[John Adams Dix|John A. Dix]], who expressed preference for an older officer to lead the cavalry division. In a letter to [[Edwin M. Stanton]], Secretary of War, dated 28 March 1863, John A. Dix wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is another subject I would like to mention. Col. Dodge of the New York Mounted Rifles has been made Brigadier General.  This regiment has given me great trouble.  It is known as “Dodge’s Rifles”.  They have plundered in all direction, and since the first of October thirty-five have deserted to the enemy, from ten different companies, most of them from outposts, carrying away their horses, arms and equipment; a thing unprecedented in any Regiment in the service.  General Peck refused to recommend his promotion, and I felt it my duty to censure him in General Orders.  General Peck does not want him, nor do I.  His influence with his regiment is not salutary.  Besides, he will be chief of Cavalry, which would otherwise be commanded by General Spear, a most gallant, experienced and efficient officer.  I beg of you to put General Dodge on duty elsewhere.  He is very young, and should be under an experienced officer if he to be continued in the Cavalry service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowitt|first1=Richard|title=A Merchant Prince of the Nineteenth Century - William E Dodge|date=1954|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=218–219  From Edwin M Stanton Papers, Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There were no other cavalry officers available with an earlier date of rank, and Dodge refused to be subordinated to someone who was junior to him in seniority. He resigned in June 1863 in protest, and briefly returned to service with the militia to suppress the [[New York City draft riots]].  On the third day of rioting Dodge led the 8th New York National Guard supported by Colonel [[Thaddeus P. Mott]]'s 14th New York Cavalry and [[John H. Howell]]'s artillery battery to [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] and [[32nd Street (Manhattan)|32nd Street]].  At the lynching of 3 African-Americans a group of rioters had assembled which possibly numbered 5,000.  The crowd retreated from the infantry and cavalry column but struck back with bricks, bats and stones.  Howell's artillery was then ordered to open fire which dispersed the rioters.&lt;ref&gt;Headley p.231&lt;/ref&gt;  The next day Dodge moved with troops to 22nd Street and engaged rioters near [[Gramercy Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Headly p.334&lt;/ref&gt;

He then went into business, and was a partner in [[Phelps Dodge Co.]], and President of the [[New York and Boston Cape Cod Canal Co.]], which was eventually purchased and completed by the Federal Government in 1914.

He died in [[New York City]] in 1910 of pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Gen. Charles C.

'''Chauncey Brooks McCormick''' (December 7, 1884 – September 8, 1954) was an [[Americans|American]] businessman and art collector in the [[McCormick family]].

==Life==
His mother was Eleanor Brooks, daughter of Walter Brooks of Baltimore.
His father was [[William Grigsby McCormick]] (1851–1941), whose father [[William Sanderson McCormick]] (1815–1865) was one of the founders of McCormick  Harvester, which merged in 1902 with the [[Deering Harvester Company]] founded by [[William Deering]] and others to form [[International Harvester]] Corporation. His father founded [[Kappa Sigma Fraternity]], and owned insurance and real estate businesses before becoming a member of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kappa Sigma |chapter= William Grigsby McCormick  |title=Caduceus of Kappa Sigma |volume= 19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VwETAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA353 |year=1904 |pages=353–356}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chauncey Brooks McCormick was born December 7, 1884, the sixth of seven children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Family record and biography |author= [[Leander James McCormick]] |year= 1896 |page=310 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QC83AAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Groton School]] and graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1907. During the summer of 1905 he worked as a common laborer in the McCormick factory. After graduation he worked for the [[Paris]] office of International Harvester. In 1907 he was gored by a wild [[elk]] while on the private game preserve of  Percy Raymond Greist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Elk Gores Yale Student: Chauncey Badly Injures Chauncey Brooks McCormick of Chicago |date= October 8, 1906 |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/10/08/101715955.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 1914 McCormick married [[Charles Deering]]'s daughter Marion Deering (1886–1965) in Paris. When the engagement was announced in June, her parents objected because "McCormick did not take life seriously enough".&lt;ref name="wed"/&gt; After a civil ceremony, the religious rite required in France was held at her uncle [[James Deering]]'s Paris residence.&lt;ref name="wed"&gt;{{cite news |title= Chauncey McCormick Weds Miss Deering, Whose Parents First Objected to Union |date= July 7, 1914 |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/07/07/101382678.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple was still in [[France]] when it became involved in [[World War I]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Paris society quiet: War Eclipses All Its Social and Business Activities |date= August 2, 1914 |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/08/02/105456185.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He joined the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] with the rank of Captain, using his connections to supply food and medical supplies to refugees. In 1918 [[Herbert Hoover]] sent him to [[Poland]] to organize aid there.&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt;
France awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de guerre]] for his services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Capt. Chauncey McCormick Awarded Croix de Guerre |date= Mar 13, 1920 |newspaper= [[Chicago Tribune]] |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/367969332.html?dids=367969332:367969332&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war they moved to St. James Farm in [[DuPage County, Illinois]], west of [[Chicago]] near modern [[Warrenville, Illinois]]. It was just south of the estate of his cousin [[Robert R. McCormick|Robert Rutherford "Colonel" McCormick]] (1880–1955) called [[Cantigny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= The Transplants: Post-World Wars: 1920-1950 |title= History of DuPage County: DuPage Roots |author= Richard A Thompson |url= http://www.dupagehistory.org/dupage_roots/Chapter5.htm  |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1925 he became a trustee of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], and became president in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chauncey McCormick: Some Recollections |author= Daniel Catton Rich |work= The Art Institute of Chicago Quarterly |pages= 61–67 |date= November 15, 1954 |jstor= 4112665 |volume=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1927 he became chairman of the art committee for the 1933 world's fair known as the [[Century of Progress]], and arranged for "the biggest, most comprehensive, most valuable loan exhibition ever assembled in the U. S."&lt;ref name="show"&gt;{{cite news |title= Art: Biggest Show |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= May 29, 1933 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,753687,00.html |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Financial problems associated with the [[Great Depression]] threatened to reduce the effort to showing popular pictures that would pay off expenses. McCormick used his connections instead to lobby for displaying the most important works he could find. They included [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s portrait of his mother known as [[Whistler's Mother]], which was sent from the [[Louvre]] with an armed guard of US troops for a tour that included a stop at the Chicago fair.&lt;ref name="show"/&gt;
On June 10, 1929, he purchased (with cousin Robert) the estate originally built around 1822 by his great grandfather Reuben Grigsby (1780–1863) known as [[Hickory Hill (Glasgow, Virginia)|Hickory Hill]].&lt;ref name="nom"&gt;{{cite web |title= Hickory Hill registration form |author= Donald J.

McCormick was a member of the International Harvester Board of Directors from 1936 until his death in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Chauncey McCormick |work= Wisconsin Historical Images |publisher= Wisconsin Historical Society |url= http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=59729 |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he never ran for public office, he was a delegate to the [[1936 Republican National Convention]]. During [[World War II]] he was Chairman of the [[Commission for Polish Relief]], and also worked on reconstruction efforts of Poland after the war.
He died on September 8, 1954 while at a vacation home in [[Seal Harbor, Maine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chauncey McCormick, 69, Leader in Chicago; International Harvester - Led Polish Relief Program Dies in Maine Hospital |date= September 9, 1954 |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F10FD3E5C177B93CBA91782D85F408585F9 |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chauncey McCormick |date= September 10, 1954 |newspaper= [[New York Daily News]] |url= http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/US-OBITS/2001-02/0982792524 |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and left his papers to the [[Newberry Library]].&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;{{cite web |title= Inventory of the Chauncey McCormick Papers, 1887-1955 |author= Emma Reynolds |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Newberry Library]] |url= http://www.newberry.org/collections/FindingAids/mccormick/McCormickpr.html |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His widow Marion McCormick also became a patron of art in Chicago and "one of the nation's richest women" when she died in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mrs. Chauncey McCormick Dies: Chicago Patron of Art Was 78; Leader in Cultural Affairs Was Said to Be One of' Nation's Richest Women |date= January 14, 1965 |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40C14F8345B157A93C6A8178AD85F418685F9 |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son [[Brooks McCormick]] (1917–2006) was the last family member to head International Harvester. Two other sons were C. Deering McCormick and Roger McCormick.
The Warrenville estate is now the St. James Farm Forest Preserve, at {{coord |41|50|2|N| 88|9|39|W| type:landmark_region:US-IL |display=inline |name=  St. James Farm Forest Preserve}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= St. James Farm |work= DuPage County Forest Preserve District web site |url= http://www.dupageforest.com/Conservation/ForestPreserves/St__James_Farm.html |accessdate= January 2, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120731050656/http://www.dupageforest.com/Conservation/ForestPreserves/St__James_Farm.html |archivedate= July 31, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of their paintings, ''[[Femme aux Bras Croisés]]'' (Woman With Crossed Arms) by [[Pablo Picasso]] from his [[Picasso's Blue Period|blue period]], was auctioned off for [[US Dollar|US$]]55 million in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Picasso Auction Record: $55 Million |date= November 9, 2000 |author= Carol Vogel |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/09/nyregion/picasso-auction-record-55-million.html |accessdate= January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Marion's sister Barbara Deering (1888–1987) married Richard Ely Danielson and also donated works to the Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Charles Deering, Mrs. Chauncey McCormick, and Mrs. Richard E.

The use, procuring or offering of a child by others for illegal activities, including [[Drug trafficking|the trafficking]] or production of drugs, is one of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention#Predefined worst forms of child labour|''predefined worst forms of child labour'']] in terms of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]], adopted in 1999.

It is also known as '''Children used by adults in the commission of crime''' (CUBAC).

In terms of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation]] ratifying countries should ensure that CUBAC is a criminal offence, and also provide for other criminal, civil or administrative remedies to ensure the effective enforcement of such national legislation (Article III(12) to (14)).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9811">A '''finance lease''' (also known as a '''capital lease''' or a '''sales lease''') is a type of [[lease]] in which a [[finance company]] is typically the legal owner of the asset for the duraton of the lease, while the lessee not only has operating control over the asset, but also has a substantial share of the economic risks and returns from the change in the valuation of the underlying asset. &lt;ref&gt;The Principles &amp; Practices of Leasing by K V Kamath et al published by Lease Asia 1990 especially chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, it is a commercial arrangement where:
* the lessee (customer or borrower) will select an [[asset]] (equipment, vehicle, software);
* the lessor (finance company) will purchase that asset;
* the lessee will have use of that asset during the lease;
* the lessee will pay a series of [[rentals]] or installments for the use of that asset;
* the lessor will recover a large part or all of the cost of the asset plus earn [[interest]] from the rentals paid by the lessee;
* the lessee has the option to acquire ownership of the asset (e.g. paying the last rental, or bargain option purchase price);

A finance lease has similar financial characteristics to [[hire purchase]] agreements and [[closed-end leasing]] as the usual outcome is that the lessee will become the owner of the asset at the end of the lease, but has different accounting treatments and tax implications.  There may be tax benefits for the lessee to lease an asset rather than purchase it and this may be the motivation to obtain a finance lease.

== Impact on accounting ==
* Since a finance lease is capitalized, both assets and liabilities in the balance sheet increase. As a consequence, [[working capital]] decreases, but the debt/equity ratio increases, creating additional leverage.
* Finance lease expenses are allocated between interest expense and principal value much like a bond or loan; therefore, in a statement of cash flows, part of the lease payments are reported under [[operating cash flow]] but part under financing cash flow. Therefore, operating cash flow increases.
* Under operating lease conditions, lease obligations are not recognized; therefore, leverage ratios are understated and ratios of return ([[return on equity|ROE]] and [[return on assets|ROA]]) are overstated.

The key IFRS criterion is:

If "substantially all the risks and rewards" of ownership are transferred to the lessee then it is a finance lease.
If it is not a finance lease then it is an operating lease.
The transfer of risk to the lessee may be shown by lease terms such as an option for the lessee to buy the asset at a low price (typically the residual value) at the end of the lease. The nature of the asset (whether it is likely to be used by anyone other than the lessee), the length of the lease term (whether it covers most of the useful life of the asset), and the present value of lease payments (whether they cover the cost of the asset) may also be factors.

IFRS does not provide a rigid set of rules for classifying leases and there will always be borderline cases. It is also still sometimes possible to use leases to make balance sheets look better, provided that the lessee can justify treating them as operating leases.

The classification of large transactions, such as sale and leasebacks of property, may have a significant effect on the accounts and on measures of financial stability such as [[Leverage (finance)|gearing]]. However, it is worth remembering that an improvement in financial gearing may be offset by a worsening of operational gearing and vice versa.

== Accounting treatment by country ==
=== International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)===
In the over 100 countries that govern accounting using [[International Financial Reporting Standards]], the controlling standard is IAS 17, "Leases". However, it is currently being phased out, to be replaced with IFRS 16, "Leases" for reporting periods from 2019. While IAS 17 is similar in many respects to FAS 13 in the U.S., IAS 17 avoids the "bright line" tests (specifying an exact percentage as a limit) on the lease term and present value of the rents. Instead, IAS 17 has the following five tests. If any of these tests are met, the lease is considered a finance lease:
* ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term;
* the lease contains a bargain purchase option to buy the equipment at less than fair market value;
* the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset even if title is not transferred;
* at the inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset.
* the leased assets are of a specialised nature such that only the lessee can use them without major modifications being made.

IAS 17 is now transitioning to IFRS 16, as a joint project with the U.S. lease accounting standard. The standard was published in 2016, with companies required to have implemented it by 2019 or earlier. The criteria for being classified as a finance lease are similar to the above, but judgement is required - simply meeting one requirement may not be enough.

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]] the accounting standard pertaining to lease is AASB 117 'Leases'. AASB 117 was released in July 2004. AASB 117 'Leases' applies to accounting for leases other than: (a) leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources; and (b) licensing agreements for such items as motion picture films, video recordings, plays, manuscripts, patents and copyrights.

According to AASB 117, paragraph 4, a lease is: an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment or series of payments the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.aasb.gov.au/admin/file/content105/c9/AASB117_07-04_COMPjun09_01-10.pdf |title=Compiled AASB Standard AASB 117 - Leases |publisher=Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) |date=December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lease is classified as a finance lease if it "transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset." (AASB 117, p8) There are no strict guidelines as to what constitutes a finance lease, however guidelines are provided within the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Australian Financial Accounting, 4th edition |author=Craig Deegan |ISBN=0-07-471479-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
Finance lease is one in  which risk and rewards incidental to the ownership of the leased asset are transferred to lessee but not the actual ownership. Thus in case of finance lease we can say that notional ownership is passed to the lessee.  The amount paid as interest during lease period is shown in P/l DR side of lessee

Features:
* it's not cancel-able 
* the lessor may or may not bear the cost of insurance, repair, maintenance etc. Usually the lessee has to bear all cost.
* the lessor may transfer ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term
* the lessee has an option to purchase the asset at a price which is expected to be sufficiently lower than the value at the end of the lease period

=== United States ===
{{main|Accounting for leases in the United States}}
Under US accounting standards, a finance (capital) lease is a lease which meets at least one of the following criteria:
* ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term;
* the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the asset and the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option;
* the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset (75% of the asset's estimated useful life or greater);
* the [[present value]] of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset (90% of the total original cost of the equipment).
* The asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.

Following the [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] [[accounting]] point of view, such a lease is classified as essentially equivalent to a ''purchase by the lessee'' and is capitalized on the lessee's [[balance sheet]]. See [http://www.fasb.org/pdf/fas13.pdf Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (FAS 13)] for more details of classification and accounting.

==== Special Case: Finance Leases under UCC Article 2A ====
The term sometimes means a special case of lease defined by Article 2A of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (specifically, Sec. 2A-103(1) (g)). Such a finance lease recognizes that some lessors are financial institutions or other business organizations that lease the goods in question purely as a financial accommodation and do not want to have the warranty and other entanglements that are usually associated with leases by companies that are manufacturers or merchants of such goods. Under a UCC 2A finance lease, the lessee pays the payments to the lessor (and indeed must do so, regardless of any defect in the leased goods – this obligation usually being contained in a "hell or high water" clause), but any claims related to defects in the leased goods may be brought only against the actual supplier of the goods. UCC 2A finance leases are usually easy to identify because they commonly contain a clause specifically declaring that the lease is to be considered a finance lease under UCC 2A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13497">'''Formulary apportionment''', also known as '''unitary taxation''', is a method of allocating profit earned (or loss incurred) by a corporation or corporate group to a particular tax jurisdiction in which the corporation or group has a taxable presence. It is an alternative to separate entity accounting, under which a branch or subsidiary within the jurisdiction is accounted for as a separate entity, requiring prices for transactions with other parts of the corporation or group to be assigned according to the [[arm's length principle|arm's length]] standard commonly used in [[transfer pricing]].  In contrast, formulary apportionment attributes the corporation's total worldwide profit (or loss) to each jurisdiction, based on factors such as the proportion of sales, assets or payroll in that jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="CAYp12"&gt;{{harvnb|Clausing|Avi-Yonah|2007|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When applied to a corporate group, formulary apportionment requires [[combined reporting]] of the group's results.  The parent and all of its subsidiaries are viewed as though they were a single entity (''unitary combination''), and the method is then also known as ''worldwide unitary taxation''.  In the US, most states have adopted water's edge combined reporting which restricts the taxable group to just US domestic corporations and excludes "overseas business organization", i.e., unitary foreign affiliates and foreign parents.

==In domestic taxation==
Formulary methods are used in both the United States and Canada to apportion income of corporations between the sub-national jurisdictions in which they operate.  In many U.S. states formulary apportionment is also used to apportion the combined income of a related group of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2005|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax in each US state is thus assessed based on the unitary combination of all related entities.&lt;ref name="MWp254"&gt;{{harvnb|McLure|Weiner|2000|pp=254&amp;ndash;255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The related entities included in the unitary combination may be worldwide entities or only entities within the United States, depending on the state. The latter is known as water's edge combined reporting. 

Worldwide unitary combined reporting was first approved by the US Supreme Court in 1983 in Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) by a vote of 5-3 (Justice Stevens did not participate). The court re-visited worldwide combined reporting in 1994 in Barclays Bank v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) and Colgate-Palmolive v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) and again approved its use by California but this time by larger majorities.  The votes were 7-2 and 9-0, respectively.  However, as a result of foreign retaliatory legislation and pressure from the federal government, all states have now abandoned mandatory worldwide combined reporting.

The use of formulary apportionment in the United States dates back to the late 19th century. At that time, there was no state or federal corporate income tax, but the states did assess [[property tax|property]] and capital stock taxes. With the growth of the [[transcontinental railroad]]s, state taxation authorities faced companies which had not just [[immovable property]] (tracks) but also non-trivial movable property ([[rolling stock]]) operating across state lines. The property value of a company assessable to state tax was thus assessed by examining the proportion of value of railway lines within the state, and then taking that proportion of the company's total value (including the movable property) as the portion of value located within a certain state. When [[Wisconsin]] adopted a state income tax in 1911, it also used formulary apportionment (based on property, cost of manufacture, and sales), pointing to the impracticality of otherwise calculating separate accounts for companies operating in multiple states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-20th century, the "Massachusetts Formula" had become a commonly used standard of formulary apportionment. The formula placed an equal weight on three factors: group sales, payroll, and property within each jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="CAYp12"/&gt; Out of the forty-four states (plus one more jurisdiction, the [[District of Columbia]]) which imposed a corporate income tax in 1978, all but [[Iowa]] used the Massachusetts Formula.&lt;ref name="Mp72"&gt;{{harvnb|Mayer|2008|p=72}}; see also ''Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair'' ([http://supreme.justia.com/us/437/267/ 437 US 267])&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa's formula ignored payroll and property, looking solely at sales; the constitutionality of this formula was challenged in the ''Moorman'' case in Iowa, and it was held invalid by a trial court under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] as well as the [[Commerce Clause]] of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]]; however, the [[Iowa Supreme Court]] reversed the trial court in 1978. This marked the beginning of a trend towards increasing weight on sales at the expense of the other two factors; by 2004, there were only twelve states still using an equally weighted formula.&lt;ref name="Mp72"/&gt;

==In international taxation==
Formulary apportionment is not used as a method of attributing profit between (rather than within) national tax jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OECD|2010|para 1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of formulary apportionment has been advocated at various times since the 1970s.  The matter has been hotly debated by [[OECD]] member states beginning in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000 Joann Weiner and Charles E. McLure Jr. proposed the use of formulary apportionment within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLure|Weiner|2000|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, the EU issued a communication advocating the use of formulary apportionment.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2001:0582:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Kimberley A. Clausing and Reuven Avi-Yonah suggested that the US [[Internal Revenue Service]] use formulary apportionment in the assessment of federal [[corporate tax in the United States|corporate income tax]], believing it would lead to increased tax revenue in the face of a trend for multinational corporations to use transfer pricing to shift profits out of the US into low-tax countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clausing|Avi-Yonah|2007|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of these suggestions has been adopted.

Several US states allow, but do not mandate, that a corporate group include foreign entities for the purpose of assessing factors used in formulary apportionment ("worldwide unitary combination"). California, for example, began to accept worldwide unitary combination in the 1940s. However, its attempt to ''require'' such combination led to strong protests from US trading partners.&lt;ref name="MWp254"/&gt; The UK-US [[double taxation treaty]] signed in 1975 included a provision to prohibit US states from "tak[ing] into account the income, deductions, receipts, or out-goings of a related enterprise" in the United Kingdom or any other country for the purpose of determining tax liability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/uk.pdf US-UK Income Tax Convention (1975)] Article 9(4)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the US Senate, whose consent was required to ratify the treaty, rejected this provision,&lt;ref name="MWp254"/&gt; and the treaty was amended by a protocol in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/uk.pdf US-UK Income Tax Convention (1975)] Protocol 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] explicitly held worldwide unitary combination as constitutional in separate cases in 1983 and 1994 ([[Barclays Bank PLC]] v. [[California Franchise Tax Board|Franchise Tax Board]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2204141 114 S.Ct. 2268 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985 the United Kingdom passed retaliatory legislation which would have overridden the UK-US tax treaty and denied significant UK tax benefits to corporations headquartered in US states which applied worldwide unitary taxation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/1/section/812/enacted Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 Section 812]&lt;/ref&gt; This and further pressure from foreign governments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yourdemocracy.newstatesman.com/parliament/unitary-taxation/HAN12824823 Debate in UK Parliament, December 18, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; the executive branch and multinational corporations led US states to adopt a "water's edge" limitation on unitary combination, allowing taxpayers to decide for themselves whether or not to include foreign entities in their combined reporting.&lt;ref name="MWp254"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Advocates claim that transfer pricing issues increase compliance costs, formulary apportionment reduces those costs and treating associated enterprises in a unitary fashion more closely reflects the underlying operating realities of multinational enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OECD|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue:
*Formulary apportionment leads to [[double taxation]] of the same profits unless there is agreement among all the jurisdictions on the formula to be used and the composition of the combined group.
*Tax could be avoided by manipulation of the components of the formula like the location of mobile assets.
*[[Compliance costs]] would be increased by the need to calculate each component of the formula in each jurisdiction.
*Compliance costs would be much higher unless all jurisdictions adopted a common method of calculating [[taxable profit]]s.  Otherwise a separate calculation of worldwide group profits would be required under each jurisdiction's [[tax accounting]] rules. The issue is significantly reduced within the United States and Canada because variations among each jurisdiction's tax accounting methods are relatively minor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxjournal.com/tj/articles/debate-should-we-move-system-unitary-taxation-18122012&lt;/ref&gt;
*If members of the group account in different currencies, currency [[exchange rate]] movements could distort the results of the apportionment.
*Formulary apportionment does not reflect the economic profit or loss of each entity. For example, a profitable group that incurs a loss in a particular territory has taxable profit apportioned to that territory, and conversely a loss-making group which makes profits in a particular territory has no taxable profits in that territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OECD|2010|pp=8&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3398">A '''Franchise Agreement''' is a legal, binding contract between a franchisor and franchisee. In the [[United States]] franchise agreements are enforced at the State level.

Prior to a franchisee signing a [[contract]], the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] regulates information disclosures under the authority of [[The Franchise Rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/franchise/bus70.pdf|title=Consumer Information|work=ftc.gov|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Franchise Rule requires a franchisee be supplied a  [[Franchise Disclosure Document]] (FDD ) (originally called [[Uniform Franchise Offering Circular]] (UFOC )) prior to signing a franchise agreement, a minimum of fourteen days before signing a franchise agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.ftc.gov/documents/inv05-buying-franchise-consumer-guide#2|title=Buying a Franchise: A Consumer Guide|work=ftc.gov|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Federal ten-day waiting period has passed, the Franchise Agreement becomes a State level jurisdiction document.  Each state has unique laws regarding franchise agreements.

A franchise agreement contents can vary significantly in content depending upon the franchise system, the state jurisdiction of the franchisor, franchisee, and arbitrator.

It overall provides the investor with a product, a branded name and recognition, and a support system.

A typical franchise agreement contains
* Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD)
* Disclosures required by state laws
* Parties defined in the agreement
* Recitals, such as Ownership of System, and Objectives of Parties
* Definitions, such as
:Agreement, Territory Area, Area Licensee, Authorized deductions, Gross Receipts, License Network, The System Manual, Trademarks, Start Date, Trade name, Termination, Transfer of [[license]].
* Licensed Rights, such as
:Territory, Rights Reserved, Term and Renewal, Minimum Performance Standard
* Franchisors Services, such as
:Administration, Collections and Billing, Consultation, Marketing, Manual, Training
* Franchisee Payments, such as
:Initial Franchise Fee, Training Fees, Marketing Fund, Royalties, Renewal fee, and Transfer fee
* Franchisee Obligations, such as
:Use of Trademarks, Financial Information, Insurance, Financial and Legal responsibility
* Relationship of Parties, such as
:Confidentiality, [[Indemnification]], Non-Compete clauses
* Transfer of License, such as
:Consent of franchisor, Termination of license, Termination by licensee
* Other provisions
* Governing law
* Amendments
* Waivers
* Arbitration
* Severability

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6029">The '''Freedom to Speak Up Review''' was a review into [[whistleblowing]] in the [[NHS in England]]. It was announced on 24 June 2014 and it was chaired by [[Robert Francis (barrister)|Sir Robert Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Borland Daily Mail (25 June 2014) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2668566/NHS-gripped-culture-fear-Inquiry-whistleblowing-set-barrister-investigated-Mid-Staffs.html NHS is still gripped by a culture of fear: Inquiry into whistleblowing set up by barrister who investigated Mid Staffs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomtospeakup.org.uk/|title=Freedom to Speak Up Review|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150218150343/https://freedomtospeakup.org.uk/|archivedate=2015-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was originally expected to report in November 2014 but took longer because of a huge volume of input material: 17,500 online responses and 600 postal responses.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Borland Daily Mail (21 January 2015) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2919200/Probe-NHS-whistleblowers-swamped-18-000-replies.html Probe into NHS whistleblowers is swamped by 18,000 replies: Officials tried to push back report after being deluged with comments by concerned staff]&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was published on 11 February 2015.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11Feb2105"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/11/nhs-whistleblowers-report-offers-no-prescription-cover-up-culture |title=NHS whistleblowers report offers no prescription for ending cover-up culture |first=Denis |last=Campbell |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 February 2015 |accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
Francis outlined twenty principles and associated actions, then concluded by making just two recommendations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cri.sagepub.com/content/20/6/128.short |title=Francis’s ‘‘Freedom to Speak Up’’ review: An openness and transparency revolution or just another report? |first=Peter |last=Walsh |journal=Clinical Risk |date= November 2014 |volume=20 |issue=6 |page=128 |doi=10.1177/1356262215575958}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# for all NHS organisations and regulators to implement all the principles and actions;
# for the Secretary of State to review progress annually.

The twenty principles to allow a consistent approach to raising concerns, while still allowing some flexibility, included:&lt;ref name=Parry&gt;Lizzie Parry Daily Mail (11 February 2015) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2948871/NHS-staff-scared-speak-poor-care-Climate-fear-leaves-worried-bullied-lose-job-speak-up.html Climate of fear leaves NHS whistleblowers 'on the brink of suicide' says report but campaigners warn new measures to protect workers 'don't go far enough']&lt;/ref&gt;
* Culture of raising concerns - to make raising issues a part of normal routine business of any well-led NHS organisation.
* Culture free from bullying - freedom of staff to speak out relies on staff being able to work in a culture which is free from bullying.
* Training - every member of staff should receive training in their trust's approach to raising concerns and in receiving and acting on them. 
* Support - all NHS trusts should ensure there is a dedicated person to whom concerns can be easily reported and without formality, a "Freedom to Speak Up Guardian" .
* Support to find alternative employment in the NHS - where a worker who has raised a concern cannot, as a result, continue their role, the NHS should help them seek an alternative job.

==Reactions==
Many campaigners claimed that the recommendations did not go far enough.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Sawer, Laura Donnelly The Telegraph (11 February 2015) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11405430/Whistleblowing-Its-still-not-safe-for-us-to-speak-out.html Whistleblowing: 'It's still not safe for us to speak out']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Sophie Borland, Claire Ellicott, Daniel Martin Daily Mail (12 February 2015) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2949934/Whistleblower-whitewash-Health-staff-dare-speak-not-protected-says-report.html Whistleblower whitewash: Health staff who dare to speak out will still not be protected, says report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 11Feb2105"/&gt;

'''futureSAX''' is the inner [[Saxony]] business plan competition of the [[Free State of Saxony]] in [[Germany]] that has an objective of lending support to start-up businesses and growing enterprises.

==Business plan competition futureSAX==

The competition is possible due to Businessplan-Wettbewerb Sachsen GmbH (BPWS), which is operated by the [[Sachsen Aufbaubank - Förderbank]].

===Conditions for participation===
People with an idea for an [[innovation|innovative]] product or service with high [[Market (economics)|market]] potential is entitled to take part in FutureSAX for free.

A condition is that the enterprise has a need for finances and the instatement of the business idea is intended to be in the state of Saxony. At least one team member must be able to provide proof of residency or work place in Saxony.

==Procedure==
FutureSAX is divided into three competition phases, in which the competing participants are aided under consultation in the development of their own business plans. During the course of the competition, the business ideas continually evolve; the participants profit from free [[seminar]] programs{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} and the opportunity to correspond with others in their industry as well as sponsors of the competition.

On the basis of a business or development idea (phase one), the production of a business and marketing strategy develops (phase two) and a detailed and professional business plan (phase three) is constructed. Each phase ends with a confidential evaluation of the practicality of the business ideas by independent juries.

The business plans that have the most judicial approval are awarded with prize money. For the first two award ceremonies, four teams are awarded - one team each per the industries of [[technology]], ITK, [[biotechnology|bio]]/[[nano-technology]], and [[service industry|service]]. With the third award ceremony, five prizes in the three categories of “start-ups”, “growth”, and “special university prize” are awarded.

Apart from the phase's closing jury vote, the technical support is guaranteed to the competitors by sponsors, such as regularly offered coaching and seminar meetings about start-up relevant information.

Apart from the technical support with the development of business plans through FutureSAX, the opportunity is granted to the competitors to establish contacts to financial sources such as [[venture capital|Venture Capitalists]], etc. at the FutureSAX [[social network|networking]] seminars.

==History==
On 7 November 2002, FutureSAX started as a Saxony industry competition for start-ups and recent growth [[Business|enterprises]]. Thus, it replaced the IT Business Plan Competition, which was exclusive for the [[information technology|IT-industry]] that had existed since 1999 and was also presented by FutureSAX.

Since 2002, more than 490 start-ups and entrepreneurs, as well as 10,000 participants in net-working meetings and workshops, have taken part in FutureSAX. However, in the 2006 competition, 140 teams took part and 188 business ideas, marketing concepts, and business plans were submitted. During the years 2003 through 2005, the competition grew approximately 67 percent.

On October 5, 2006, FutureSAX launched into its fifth open-industry competition, which ran until 18 July 2007. The total prize money amounted to 68,000 [[euro]]s.

'''Grays Armory''' is a historic building in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].  It was built by the Cleveland Grays, a private military company which was founded in 1837.&lt;ref name="Cleveland Grays"&gt;[http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CG3 Cleveland Grays], Cleveland Grays - The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is one of the oldest standing buildings in downtown Cleveland.

== The Cleveland Grays ==
The Cleveland Grays is a social organization devoted to the promotion of patriotism and the preservation of the military heritage of Greater Cleveland.&lt;ref name="Cleveland Grays" /&gt;  It was founded as a volunteer private military company at a time when the common or constitutional militia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html |title=United States Constitution, Article I, Section 8 |publisher=The United States National Archives and Records Administration |work=The United States Constitution |accessdate=17 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; languished due to disinterest and neglect by state politicians.&lt;ref name= "The Cleveland Grays"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cleveland Grays: An Urban Military Company, 1837-1919 |last=Vourlojianis |first= George N. |year=2002 |publisher=The Kent State University Press |location=Kent, Ohio |isbn=0-87338-678-7 |pages= 1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit's original purpose was twofold:  to provide assistance and support to the local law enforcement authorities of the time as well as to provide a first line of defense for the city in the event that the fighting in Canada's [[Rebellions of 1837]] spilled over the border and into the United States resulting in a third war with the United Kingdom in less than a century.&lt;ref&gt;Vourlojianis (2002), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  The unit's motto is '''[[Semper Paratus]]''' (from the Latin: "Always Ready").&lt;ref name="Cleveland Grays" /&gt;

The first organizational meeting was held on August 28, 1837, and on September 18, seventy-eight men joined the active company.  At the time of its founding, the unit was called The Cleveland City Guards but within the next year the membership decided that their organization would be known by reference to the gray color of their uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Vourlojianis (2002), pp. 7-11&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 29, 1838 the Grays made one of the first of their many parade appearances fully dressed in their distinctive gray uniforms and tall black [[bearskin]] caps.  As the years passed, those who had earned the status of "Pioneer" for their membership of twenty-five or more years were entitled to add leather aprons to their uniforms and to carry axes when on parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rose |first=William Ganson |year=1990 |title=Cleveland: The Making Of A City |publisher=The Kent State University Press |publication-place=Kent, Ohio |page=165 |isbn=0-87338-428-8 |lccn=90-4853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grays saw military service as a unit during the Civil War and the Spanish–American War.&lt;ref name="Cleveland Grays" /&gt; Reforms of the country's militia system which began with the [[Militia Act of 1903]] and continued with subsequent legislation at the state and federal levels meant that the era of private military companies' official participation in national military affairs had come to an end and while the Grays, under the leadership of Ludwig S. Connelly, were able to enlist in the Ohio National Guard (ONG) for duty during the Mexican Punitive Expedition, they essentially did so as a group of private citizens enlisting ''en masse'' and not as a private military company.  Their participation in World War I, which began immediately upon their ONG unit's release from duty on the Mexican border, was the last conflict in which the Grays saw active service even as a group of enlistees.&lt;ref&gt;Vourlojianis (2002), pp. 91-115&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual members have served in subsequent conflicts.&lt;ref name="Cleveland Grays" /&gt;

==Building==
The Grays made their home in several different places from the time of their founding until the completion of their own building on Bolivar Road.  The Grays' first [[Armory (military)|armory]] was located on the fourth floor of the Mechanics Block, newly erected in 1838 at the southeast corner of Ontario Street and Prospect Street.&lt;ref&gt;Rose (1990), pp. 154, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1870, they moved into a building which had once served as a fire station on Frankfort Street.&lt;ref&gt;Rose (1990), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;  By March 20, 1880 the Grays had moved into the new City Armory on Long Street&lt;ref&gt;Rose (1990), p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; and used that facility as its headquarters along with the 5th Regiment, Ohio National Guard until December 8, 1892 when fire destroyed the building and much of its contents including equipment and guns belonging to the Grays.  Major Otto Schade and several of his men were able to save a few items without any cost to their health or their lives.  The unit was able to recover very quickly and funds were soon amassed for the purpose of building a new armory.  Until construction was completed in 1893, the company found a temporary home at the Gatling Gun Battery Armory on Sibley Street.&lt;ref&gt;Rose (1990), p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the fire===
[[File:Cleveland Grays Armory Archway.jpg|thumb|right|The armory's entrance]]
On May 30, 1893. a three-ton [[Berea sandstone]] foundation block was put in place by Colonel [[John Frazee]]. The main portion of the building is four stories high, and the most notable feature is the five-story tower on the northeast corner of the building. The tower has '3 x 5' foundation blocks, the main entrance corners and the front window lintels are all of solid rough-hewn sandstone. The main entry arch rests on top of polished granite columns that rise from each cornerstone. Positioned above is a black iron [[drop-gate]], and a gothic barrier between the front steps and the colossal oak doors. There were also pointed iron rods bolted to the scarlet brick walls that make up the window protectors on the first floor. The effect is a splendid mix of color and texture in materials. The overall design effectively conveys that this is an urban fortress.

The Cleveland Grays Armory has been long known for hosting the city's premiere social events. Grays Armory earned repute as an exclusive venue right from the beginning during the celebrations for Cleveland's Centennial (1896). The Grays Armory events went way beyond the customary military balls and band concerts typical during that era. This building was originally built to house weapons and provides a drill hall for the militia; this edifice quickly evolved into a vital community center for the turn-of-the century Clevelanders.

==Cleveland Grays Armory Museum==
The Grays Armory Museum seeks to share its historical and cultural legacy with the public. Beyond stewardship of the building and conservation of artifacts, the museum strives to preserve the traditions and the rich heritage of those who serve their country and their community. The museum actively fulfills this objective by preserving, interpreting and presenting the [[military history of the United States]]. The museum regularly reaches out to Greater Cleveland by sponsoring open-house events intended to reach diverse audiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2355">'''Gustav Humbert''' (born February 1950 in [[Celle]], [[West Germany]]) is the former [[Chief executive officer]] and [[President (corporate title)|President]] of [[Airbus|Airbus SAS]], and a former member of the [[EADS]] Executive Committee.

== Airbus ==
Humbert joined Airbus management in July 2000, as the [[Chief operating officer]] and a member of the [[EADS|EADS']] ([[Airbus|Airbus']] [[Parent company]]) Executive Committee, and in March 2004 he was appointed [[Airbus]]’ Executive Vice-President - Programmes. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/people/Humbert_bio.html Source]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005 he was appointed Airbus President and Chief Executive Officer, a position he held until 2 July 2006, when he resigned from these various positions as a result of further delays on the [[Airbus A380]] production line and other delivery program setbacks, announced the previous month, on 14 June.

=== Resignation ===
While announcing his [[resignation]], Humbert said the delays were a "major disappointment" for Airbus, and "as President and CEO of Airbus, must take responsibility for this setback and ... offer my resignation to our shareholders."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airbus.com/en/presscentre/pressreleases/pressreleases_items/07_02_06_humbert.html Resignation Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal ==
Humbert holds a degree in mechanical engineering from the [[University of Hanover|Hannover Technical University]] as well as a PhD in engineering from the [[University of Hanover]] [http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/people/Humbert_bio.html], and was even a visiting professor of [[mechanical engineering]] at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] in 1979.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1386">In [[contract law]] or [[tort law]], the term '''heads of loss''' or '''heads of claim''' refers to categories of damage that a party may incur.  It uses the term "head" in its sense of "category"; each head of loss refers to the damages that correspond to a particular category of duty.

==Contract law==

When used in the context of contracts, "loss" is the equivalent of damages at common law. The measure of such damages can be complex, but the starting position is to put the injured party in the same position (so far as money can accomplish) as if the contract had been correctly performed&lt;ref&gt;Robinson v. Harman (1848) 1 Ex 850.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a book on "Building Contract Claims" lists the following "more common heads of loss":&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RMR1RiHGSEkC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=%22heads+of+loss%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FpC9khVJ_F&amp;sig=nKHA0_hzBekrFRX-3bZIlSEMSa4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IDBaSoyhOKWEmQe37I3yAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 ''Building Contract Claims'', David Chappell,  [[Vincent Powell-Smith]],  John Sims]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hubs and nodes''' is a geographic model explaining how linked regions can co-operate to fulfill elements of an industry's [[value chain]] and collectively gain sufficient mass to drive [[innovation]] growth. The model of hubs and nodes builds on [[Porter's cluster]] model which served well in the past, but as businesses and regions around the world have adjusted to the realities of [[globalization]], the concept of clusters is becoming outdated.

==Disaggregation of clusters==
Companies are realizing that they may not require a particular stage of production to be in close geographic proximity. As barriers to long-distance national and global transactions have fallen through advances in [[technology]] and [[logistics]], such as the growth of the [[Internet]] and [[Courier|overnight package services]], it has become increasingly possible to relocate operations such as [[research]], [[New product development|product development]], and [[manufacturing]] to countries and regions with relevant expertise and lower costs. It is common among [[consumer goods]], for example, to have concept generation centered in one locale, product testing and refinement in another, and manufacturing and [[distribution (business)|distribution]] in still others. Elements of development, production and distribution are being more and more completed beyond the borders of historical clusters. 

As more companies progress beyond the cluster model, they increasingly expand and diversify their operations to locations where their investments will be most profitable. For companies adequately prepared for the rapid globalization process, their [[research and development]], manufacturing and distribution stages fare better as these businesses are able to reduce their costs and potentially realizing new efficiencies and increased speeds of product development. The spirit of the cluster model may remain intact, and the various stages of production will still be shared by a number of different entities, but geographical proximity need no longer bind the entities together

Shiloah was born in [[Maoz Haim]], a Kibbutz in northern Israel. Drafted to the army in 1977, he served in the Special Forces unit [[Sayeret Matkal]]. After completing his service, Shiloah obtained a BA in Economics &amp; Management from [[Tel Aviv University]], where he also achieved an MBA.

In 1995, Shiloah was appointed as the CEO of Kesher-Barel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarker.com/advertising/1.119695 |title=אילן שילוח, מנכ"ל ושותף, מקאן קשר בראל, הוא איש השיווק של החודש  - מדיה ופרסום - דה מרקר TheMarker|publisher=www.themarker.com |date=2002-07-11|accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=833855 |title=התחנה הבאה של אילן שילוח - גלובס

An '''inside director''' is a member of the [[board of directors]] of a [[corporation]] who is also a member of the corporation's [[management]], almost always a [[corporate officer]]. For example, a [[chief executive officer]] who is also [[Chair (official)|chairman of the board]] would be considered an inside director. A [[chief financial officer]], [[executive vice president]], or other corporate executive who is a member of the board is also an inside director. Inside directors commonly enjoy seats on boards because they own [[Ownership equity|equity]] in the company.

Inside directors are differentiated from [[outside director]]s, who do not hold a management position in the corporation which the board governs.

The '''International Color Consortium''' ('''ICC''') was formed in 1993 by eight vendors in order to create an open, vendor-neutral [[color management]] system which would function transparently across all [[operating system]]s and software packages.

The ICC specification, currently on version 4.3,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.color.org/specification/ICC1v43_2010-12.pdf Specification ICC.1:2010-12 ], 2010 revision of the [[ICC profile]] standard&lt;/ref&gt; allows for matching of [[color]] when moved between applications and [[operating system]]s, from the point of creation to the final output, whether display or print.  This specification is technically identical to ISO 15076-1:2010, available from [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]].

The [[ICC profile]] which describe the color attributes of a particular device or viewing requirement by defining a mapping between the source or target [[color space]] and a ''profile connection space'' (PCS).

The ICC defines the format precisely but does not define algorithms or processing details. This means there is room for variation between different applications and systems that work with ICC profiles.

ICC has also published a preliminary specification for iccMAX, a next-generation color management architecture with significantly expanded functionality and a choice of colorimetric, spectral or material connection space. Details are at [http://www.color.org/iccmax/index.xalter http://www.color.org/iccmax/]

'''John Avery McIlhenny''' (1867&amp;ndash;1942) was an [[United States|American]] [[businessman]], [[soldier]], [[politician]] and [[public servant]]. He was the eldest son of [[Tabasco sauce]] inventor [[Edmund McIlhenny]].

==Background==
Born on [[Avery Island]], [[Louisiana]], McIlhenny was educated on the Island by private tutors before attending [[Dr. Holbrook's Military School]] in Sing Sing (now [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]]), [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. He later attended business school in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], as well as [[Tulane University|Tulane]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] universities (although he did not complete his studies).&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard, ''Tabasco: An Illustrated History'' (Avery Island, La.: McIlhenny Company, 2007), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1880s McIlhenny worked as a [[clerk (position)|clerk]] on a ship in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], but returned to Avery Island on the death of his father in 1890. Assuming control of Tabasco operations, he ran [[Tabasco sauce|McIlhenny Company]] for eight years, expanding and modernizing production, and increasing promotion and advertising of the increasingly famous product.&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard, ''Tabasco: An Illustrated History'' (Avery Island, La.: McIlhenny Company, 2007), p. 58, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Smalltbad.jpg|left|175px|thumb|[[Tabasco sauce|Tabasco brand pepper sauce]] advertisement from John Avery McIlhenny's tenure as head of [[Tabasco sauce|McIlhenny Company]], circa 1895]]

==As Rough Rider==
In 1898 McIlhenny resigned from the company to serve in the [[Spanish–American War]], joining [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Rough Riders]] volunteer [[cavalry]] regiment. "[B]y his high qualities and zealous attention to duty," wrote Roosevelt in his memoir of the campaign, McIlhenny "speedily rose to a sergeantcy, and finally won his lieutenancy for gallantry in action."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Roosevelt, ''The Rough Riders'' (New York: Da Capo, 1990), pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  McIlhenny participated in the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]] and the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] and continued to serve despite suffering from [[measles]] and [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard, ''Tabasco: An Illustrated History'' (Avery Island, La.: McIlhenny Company, 2007), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service==
On his return to civilian life, McIlhenny served in the [[Louisiana State Legislature]], winning a seat in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] from 1900 to 1904 and in the state [[Louisiana Senate|Senate]] from 1904 to 1906 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. A close companion of Theodore Roosevelt, in 1906 he accepted then President Roosevelt's offer to help oversee the [[United States Civil Service Commission]], during which he enacted numerous reforms which streamlined the federal [[bureaucracy]]. McIlhenny retained his position with the commission under Roosevelt's successor, [[William Howard Taft]], as well as under [[Woodrow Wilson]].

He resigned in 1919, however, to accept a position with the [[U.S. State Department]] as a [[financial adviser]] to [[Haiti]], during the island republic's [[United States occupation of Haiti|occupation]] by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]]. During his time in Haiti, he clashed with Haitian president [[Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave]] over economic issues, which resulted in McIlhenny suspending Dartiguenave's salary, causing a diplomatic crisis and inviting private criticism from the U.S. State Department.&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard, "Soldier, Patriot, Christian, Gentleman: A Biographical Sketch of John Avery McIlhenny," ''Attakapas Gazette'' (Attakapas Historical Association / Center for Louisiana Studies, University of Southwestern Louisiana, 1993), 7, 9, 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and death==
McIlhenny retired in 1922 and settled in a [[farmhouse]] near [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]]. Over the next several years he renewed his interest in McIlhenny Company, helping with its reorganization, as a major [[shareholder]] in the family-owned company. After a prolonged illness, McIlhenny died in 1942 and was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard, ''Tabasco: An Illustrated History'' (Avery Island, La.: McIlhenny Company, 2007), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liquid air''' is [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] that has been cooled to very low temperatures ([[cryogenics|cryogenic temperatures]]), so that it has condensed into a pale blue  mobile liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Babbage|title=Difference Engine: End of the electric car?|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/10/nitrogen-cycle|work=The Economist|accessdate=Oct 21, 2012|date=Oct 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To thermally insulate it from [[room temperature]], it is stored in specialized containers ([[vacuum flask|Vacuum insulated flasks]] are often used). Liquid air can absorb heat rapidly and revert to its gaseous state. It is often used for condensing other substances into liquid and/or solidifying them, and as an industrial source of [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[argon]], and other [[inert gas]]es through a process called [[air separation]].

== Properties ==
Liquid air has a density of approximately 870&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (0.87 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), though the density may vary depending on the elemental composition of the air. Since dry gaseous air contains approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% [[argon]], the density of liquid air at standard composition is calculated by the percentage of the components and their respective liquid densities (see [[liquid nitrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]]). Although air contains trace amounts of [[carbon dioxide]] (about 0.040%), this gas [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublime]]s (transfers directly between gas and solid, and therefore does not exist as a liquid) at pressures less than 5.1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s.

The boiling point of liquid air is -194.35&amp;nbsp;°C, intermediate between the boiling points of [[liquid nitrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]]. However, it can be difficult to keep at a stable temperature as the liquid boils, since the nitrogen will boil off first, leaving the mixture oxygen-rich and changing the boiling point. This may also occur in some circumstances due to the liquid air condensing oxygen out of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Armararego. W. L. F. and Perrin. D. D., Purification of Laboratory Chemicals 4th edition. Reed Educational and Professional Publishing Ltd (1996). p36&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid air freezes at approximately 58 K (-215&amp;nbsp;°C)(-355 F), also at standard atmospheric pressure.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Preparation ==

=== Principle of production ===
The constituents of air were once known as "permanent gases", as they could not be liquified solely by compression at room temperature. A compression process will raise the temperature of the gas. This heat is removed by cooling to the ambient temperature in a heat exchanger, and then expanding by venting into a chamber. The expansion causes a lowering of the temperature, and by [[Countercurrent exchange|counter-flow heat exchange]] of the expanded air, the pressurized air entering the expander is further cooled. With sufficient compression, flow, and heat removal, eventually droplets of liquid air will form, which may then be employed directly for low temperature demonstrations.

The main constituents of air were liquefied for the first time by Polish scientists [[Zygmunt Florenty Wróblewski]] and [[Karol Olszewski]] in 1883.

Devices for the production of liquid air are simple enough to be fabricated by the experimenter using commonly available materials.

=== Process of manufacture ===
The most common process for the preparation of liquid air is the two-column [[Hampson–Linde cycle]] using the [[Joule–Thomson effect]]. Air is fed at high pressure (&gt;60 [[Pressure measurement#Absolute, gauge and differential pressures - zero reference|psig]], or 520 kPa) into the lower column, in which it is separated into pure nitrogen and oxygen-rich liquid. The rich liquid and some of the nitrogen are fed as reflux into the upper column, which operates at low pressure (&lt;10 psig, or 170 kPa), where the final separation into pure nitrogen and oxygen occurs. A raw argon product can be removed from the middle of the upper column for further purification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =| first =| date =| url =http://www.linde.com/international/web/linde/like35lindecom.nsf/docbyalias/page_ch_chronicle_18911934details_1| title =Air liquefaction, "Linde Air", rectification: into new markets with new research findings| publisher =The Linde Group| accessdate =2007-08-09| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213521/http://www.linde.com/international/web/linde/like35lindecom.nsf/docbyalias/page_ch_chronicle_18911934details_1| archivedate =2007-09-27| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
In manufacturing processes, the liquid air product is fractionated into its constituent gases in either liquid or gaseous form, as the oxygen is especially useful for [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|fuel gas welding and cutting]], and the argon is useful as an oxygen-excluding [[shielding gas]] in [[gas tungsten arc welding]]. [[Liquid nitrogen]] is useful in various low-temperature applications, being nonreactive at normal temperatures (unlike oxygen), and boiling at {{convert|77|K|0}}.

===Transport and energy storage===
{{main|Liquid Air|Cryogenic energy storage}}
Between 1899 and 1902, the automobile [[Liquid Air]] was produced and demonstrated by a joint American/English company, with the claim that they could construct a car that would run a hundred miles on liquid air.

On 2 October 2012, the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] said liquid air could be used as a means of storing energy. This was based on a technology that was developed by Peter Dearman, a garage inventor in [[Hertfordshire]], England to power vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19785689 | work=BBC News | title=Liquid air 'offers energy storage hope' | date=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4068">'''William Edward "Ned" Herrmann''' (1922 – December 24, 1999) was an American creativity researcher and author, known for his [[research]] in [[creative thinking]]&lt;ref name="NH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbdi.com/ned_herrmann.htm |title=Ned Herrmann (1922-1999): Pioneer of creative thinking in the corporation and founder of Whole Brain Technology |accessdate=2006-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306232953/http://www.hbdi.com/ned_herrmann.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2005 |df= }}. at ''hbdi.com'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and whole-brain methods.

''Potentials, IEEE'' 13.5 (1994): 4-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rick Crandall (1999) ''Celebrate Customer Service.'' p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
At [[Cornell University]], Herrmann majored in both [[physics]] and [[music]] in the Class of 1943. He continued to study at the Graduate Studies R.P.I., New York University.&lt;ref name="NH"/&gt;

After graduation Hermann became manager of [[Management Education]] for [[General Electric]] (GE) in 1970. His primary responsibility was to oversee training program design; specifically, maintaining or increasing an individual's [[productivity]], [[motivation]], and [[creativity]].

In 1978, Herrmann created the "Herrmann Participant Survey Form."  He profiled workshop participant's thinking styles and learning preferences in accord with brain dominance theory.  This quickly evolved into a theory of stable brain quadrants, independent of brain anatomy facts, each with its own characteristic “genius.”  He developed the [[Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument]] (HBDI), the scored and analyzed Participant Survey, and designed the [[Applied Creative Thinking Workshop]] (ACT), which remains a leading personality assessment instrument and workshop topic in corporate training.

Herrmann's contributions brought him worldwide recognition. In 1992, he received the Distinguished Contribution to Human Resource Development Award from the [[American Society for Training &amp; Development]] (ASTD). In 1993, he was elected [[President (corporate title)|President]] of The American Creativity Association.

== Work ==
Herrmann was a pioneer in exploring, explicating and expanding understanding of the brain in close-up view as a four quadrant system. He was one of the first to ascertain, through testing, how individuals use or prefer one, two, three or all four possible brain quadrants.  His approach to brain balance was to encourage experiments, use and exercise of weaker quadrants through live, in-person games, small group processes and discussion.  This evolved into more and better ideas about whole-brainedness.

He spent 30 years from approximately 1964-1996, exploring and explicating [[Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument]] to [[teaching]], [[learning]], increased self-understanding and enhanced creative thinking capabilities, on both an individual and corporate level.

'''Overtime rate''' is a calculation of hours worked by a worker that exceed those hours defined for a standard [[workweek]]. This rate can have different meanings in different countries and jurisdictions, depending on how that jurisdiction's [[labor law]] defines [[overtime]]. In many jurisdictions, additional pay is mandated for certain classes of workers when this set number of hours is exceeded. In others, there is no concept of a standard workweek or analogous time period, and no additional pay for exceeding a set number of hours within that week.

The '''overtime rate''' calculates the [[ratio]] between employee [[overtime]] with the '''regular hours''' in a specific time period. Even if the work is planned or scheduled, it can still be considered overtime if it exceeds what is considered the standard workweek in that jurisdiction.

A high overtime rate is a good indicator of a temporary or permanent high [[workload]], and can be a contentious issue in [[labor-management relations]].&lt;ref name="ucexample"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycal.org/2013/08/11/high-overtime-among-uc-medical-care-workers-may-indicate-understaffing/ |title=High overtime among UC medical care workers may indicate understaffing |last=Shah |first=Sohan |date=August 11, 2013 |newspaper=[[Daily Californian]] |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could result in a higher illness rate,&lt;ref name="sick"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/may/11/overtime-heart-risks-research |title=Too much overtime is bad for your health, says study |last=Boseley |first=Sarah |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 11, 2010 |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; lower safety rate,&lt;ref name="danger"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://oem.bmj.com/content/62/9/588.full |title=The impact of overtime and long work hours on occupational injuries and illnesses: new evidence from the United States |last1=Dembe |first1=A.

==United States==
In the United States a standard workweek is considered to be 40 hours. [[Independent contractor#Independent contractor versus employee|Most waged employees or so-called non-exempt workers under U.S. federal labor and tax law]] must be paid at a wage rate of 150% of their regular hourly rate for hours that exceed 40 in a week. The start of the pay week can be defined by the employer, and need not be a standard calendar week start (e.g., Sunday midnight). Many employees, especially [[shift work]]ers in the U.S., have some amount of overtime built into their schedules so that [[24/7]] coverage can be obtained.

==Formula ==

&lt;math&gt; \textstyle{\mbox{Overtime Rate } = \frac{\sum{\mbox{Overtime Hours}}}{\sum{\mbox{Regular Hours (defined)}}}} \times 100 \%&lt;/math&gt;

The Pallache have had connections with both Portuguese and Spanish Sephardic communities, as detailed below.

The Pallache established themselves in cities in Portugal (?), Morocco, the Netherlands, Turkey, Egypt, and other countries from the 1500s through the 1900s.  The family includes [[Chief Rabbi]]s, [[rabbi]]s, founders of [[synagogue]]s and [[beth midrash|batei midrash]], scientists, entrepreneurs, writers, and others.  Best known to date are:  Moroccan envoys and brothers [[Samuel Pallache]] (ca. 1550–1616) and [[Joseph Pallache]], at least three grand rabbis of Izmir – [[Gaon (Hebrew)|Gaon]].&lt;ref&gt;

==History==

===Inquisitions and expulsions===

[[File:Expulsion judios-en.svg|right|200px|Expulsions of Jews in Europe (1100–1600)]]

In 1480, Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] and King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] established a Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition ({{lang-es|Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisición|links=no}}), commonly known as the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (''Inquisición española'').  Its dual purpose was to maintain [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] orthodoxy in Spain while replacing the [[Medieval Inquisition]] under [[Papal]] control.  On March 31, 1492, Isabella  and Ferdinand issued the [[Alhambra Decree]] (or "Edict of Expulsion"), thereby ordering the expulsion of practicing Jews from the [[Kingdom of Castile|Kingdoms of Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], its territories, and it possessions by July 31 that year–in four months.&lt;ref name="Decree-translation"&gt;

On December 5, 1496, King [[Manuel I of Portugal|ManueI of Portugal]] decreed that all Jews must convert to Catholicism or leave the country.  Jews who converted to Christianity were known as [[New Christians]].  This initial edict of expulsion turned into an edict of forced conversion by 1497.  In 1506, the [[Lisbon Massacre]] erupted.  In 1535, Portugal launched its own [[Portuguese Inquisition|inquisition]].  Portuguese Jews fled to the Ottoman Empire (notably [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Constantinople]] and to [[Wattasid Dynasty|Morocco]]. Some went to [[Amsterdam]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Colony of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Curaçao]], and the [[Antilles]].  Some of the most famous descendants of Portuguese Jews who lived outside [[Portugal]] are the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] (from Portuguese Bento de Espinosa), and the classical economist [[David Ricardo]].  While Portugal was under control of the [[Philippine Dynasty]] of the [[House of Habsburg]] (1581–1640), the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] blended with the Spanish.

The combined Spanish-Portuguese inquisitions caused one of the largest [[Jewish diaspora|diasporas]] in [[Jewish history]].

José Maria Abecassis cites historian [[Abraham ibn Daud]] of Toledo (ca. 1110–1180), who wrote:  &lt;blockquote&gt;''Segundo o historiador Abraham Ben Daud (''Sepher Ha-Qabbalah'', 69) a família Pallache já era célebre em Córdova no séc. 10. Após a expulsão de Espanha em 1492 foi para Marrocos, donde posteriormente se ramificou na Holanda, Turquia, Palestina e em Gibraltar.''&lt;br&gt;''Outras grafias: Palatio, Pallacío, Payachia. ''&lt;br&gt;''Membros desta familia prestaram serviços eminentes a Marrocos no séc. 17. Distinguiram-se como embaixadores ou enviados dos sultões na Europa, especialmente na Holanda. Estabeleceram relações diplomáticas e criaram importantes trocas comerciais com o seu país.''&lt;br&gt;''Os Palaçano viviam em Portugal antes da Expulsão.''&lt;br&gt; According to the historian Abraham Ben Daud (''Sepher Ha-Qabbalah'', 69) the Pallache family was already famous in Cordoba in the 10th century. After expulsion from Spain in 1492, they went to Morocco, where later they branched out to Holland, Turkey, Palestine, and Gibraltar.&lt;br&gt; Other spellings: Palatio, Pallacío, Payachia.&lt;br&gt; Members of this family provided eminent services to Morocco in the 17th century. They distinguished themselves as ambassadors or envoys of the Sultans in Europe, especially in Holland.

===Portugal===

At present, it is unclear as to whether members of the Pallache family went first to Portugal after Spain.  However, new findings show that their intermarriage started earlier than supposed in ''A Man in Three Worlds'' (see "Netherlands," below).

===Morocco===

[[File:Jüdische Hochzeit in Marokko-1024.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jewish Wedding in Morocco by [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]]]     Jewish presence in Morocco goes back to [[Carthage]], fared moderately, and often prospered under Muslim rule (e.g., the [[Marinid dynasty]]).  From Morocco, they filtered into [[Al-Andalus]] (Islamic Spain, 711–1492) but began to return during the [[Spanish Reconquista]], which mounted in the 10th Century.  The Spanish-Portuguese expulsions and inquisitions sent floods of Jews back to Morocco on a larger scale.  Resultant overcrowding in Moroccan cities led to tension, fires, and famines in Jewish quarters.

Moïse Al Palas (also Moses al-Palas&lt;ref name=Pallache-Moroccan /&gt;) (???–1535), born in Marrakesh, was a rabbi who moved to [[Tetuán]] and lived for a time in [[Salonica]], then in the Ottoman Empire.  Before dying in [[Venice]], he published ''Va-Yakhel Moshe'' (1597) and ''Ho'il Moshe'' (1597), and an autobiography.&lt;ref name=Pallache-Moroccan /&gt;&lt;ref name=JVL-Palache /&gt;&lt;ref name=Patronymes&gt;

Isaac Pallache was a rabbi in [[Fez, Morocco]], first mentioned in ''[[takkanot]]'' (Jewish community statutes) in 1588.  His sons were '''Samuel Pallache''' (ca. 1550–1616) and '''Joseph Pallache'''.  Isaac was married to a sister of Fez's grand rabbi, [[Judah Uziel]]; his nephew [[Isaac Uziel]] became a rabbi of the Neve Shalom community in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

===Netherlands===

[[File:Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael - The Jewish Cemetery - WGA20486.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[The Jewish Cemetery]]'' by [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], where [[Samuel Pallache]], his brother, and descendants lie buried]]  Jews began to settle in the Netherlands only at the end of the 16th Century.  Thanks to its own recent (1581) independence from Spanish control, the [[Dutch Republic]] attracted [[Sephardic Jews in the Netherlands]] as a refuge from a common enemy, Spain.

After an unsuccessful attempt to return to Spain in the mid-1600s, Samuel and Joseph Pallache settled a new branch of the Pallache family in the Netherlands by 1608.  There, they represented their benefactor, [[Zidan al-Nasir]] of Morocco, as well as the Dutch government, in complex negotiations with Morocco, the Netherlands, Spain, France, England, the Ottoman Empire, and other European states – often on behalf of more than one sponsoring state and (as stateless Jews) on their own behalf.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

The sons of both brothers continued in their fathers's footsteps, some remaining in the Netherlands (e.g., David Pallache), others returning to Morocco (e.g., Moses Pallache).

In the Netherlands, the surname solidified as "Palache" (a spelling variation which started in the 16th Century), and the family continues as Palache in the Netherlands to the present.  In recent times, prominent members have included grand rabbi '''[[Isaac Juda Palache]]''' (1858-1927) and his son, Professor '''[[Juda Lion Palache]]''' (1887-1944).

''A Man in Three Worlds'' did not find intermarriage between the Pallache brothers or sons and members of the Portuguese Sephardic community in the Netherlands.  In fact, it documents the contrary, e.g., that sons Isaac and Joshuae did not go make such marriages.  "It seems significant that no male member of the Pallache family ever married a woman from the Portuguese community...  it is surely significant that neither Samuel nor any of his heirs were ever to marry into the great trading families of 'the Portuguese nation'."&lt;ref name=three /&gt;  In September 2016, however, two 1643 marriage certificates were discovered for [[David Pallache]] (1598–1650&lt;ref name=David-Record&gt;

===Turkey===

[[File:Abraham palagi.jpg |thumb|right|200px|[[Abraham Palacci]]]]      [[Romaniotes|Jewis]] have lived in Asia Minor (Turkey) since the 5th Century BCE.  The [[Ottoman Empire]] welcomed Sephardic Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula.  (Today, the majority of [[Turkish Jews in Israel|Turkish Jews live in Israel]], while modern-day Turkey continues to host a modest Jewish population.)

The first reported Pallache in Turkey (then, the Ottoman Empire) dates to 1695, when Isaac Pallache of Leghorn ([[Livorno]], Italy) wrote a letter to the Dutch consul in Smyrna (1695)&lt;ref name=three /&gt;&lt;ref name=Patronymes /&gt;  Currently, it is unknown whether the Pallache settled first in Istanbul or Izmir.

The Pallache appear in Izmir (then, "Smyrna") no later than the time of rabbi Jacob Pallache, who married the daughter of a previous grand rabbi '''[[Joseph ben Hayyim Hazan|Joseph Raphael ben Hayyim]] [[Hazzan (surname)|Hazzan]]'''.&lt;ref name=HazanGen&gt;

According to the ''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World'':  &lt;blockquote&gt;The Pallache... produced several leading rabbinical scholars in the Ottoman city of Izmir (Smyrna) during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Two of them, Hayyim ben Jacob and his sone Abraham, served as chief rabbi (''hakham bashi'') and became the focus of a fierce dispute that engulfed the town's Jewish community, while a third, Soloman ben Abraham, contributed to its decline.&lt;ref name=Pallache-Turkish /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Pallache continued in Turkey past the 1922 [[great fire of Smyrna]]; some left during Allied evacuation during World War II and died during the Holocaust (see below).&lt;ref name=Deported&gt;

===Egypt===

[[File:Demonstration in Egypt in 1919 (Crescent, the Cross and Star of David).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|Demonstration in Egypt in 1919]]]]   The [[Torah]] documents a long history of Jews in Egypt.  Jews lived quietly under the Romans until the advent of Christianity (e.g., Emperor [[Heraclius I]] and [[Patriarch Cyrus of Alexandria]]).  After the [[Arab conquest]], Jews survived reasonably well under the [[Tulunids]] (863–905), the [[Fatimids]] (969–1169), and the [[Ayyubids]] (1174–1250) during whose rule [[Maimonides]] lived.  Under the [[Bahri Mamluks]] (1250–1390), Jews began to feel less secure and less so under the [[Burji dynasty|Burji Mamluks]] (1390–1517).  The [[Ottomans]] (1517–1922) took more active interest in the Jewish community and made substantial changes in their governance.  [[Shabbatai Zvi]] visited Cairo, where his movement continued under [[Abraham Miguel Cardozo]], physician to the pasha Kara Mohammed.  Following the [[Damascus Affair]], [[Moses Montefiore]], [[Adolphe Crémieux]], and [[Salomon Munk]] visited Egypt in 1840 and helped found schools with Rabbi [[Moses Joseph Algazi]].

It was a period of rapid change in Egypt.  As of 1867, the government began changing from ''pasha'' to ''[[Khedivate of Egypt|khedive]]'', to ''[[Sultanate of Egypt|sultan]]'' and threw off Ottoman [[suzerainty]].  It also saw the building of the [[Suez Canal]].  Political unrest exploded after World War I, led by [[Saad Zaghlul]] and the [[Wafd Party]]) and culminating in the [[Egyptian revolution of 1919]] and the issue by the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916–1922)|UK government]] (colonial controllers in the 1800s) of a [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|unilateral declaration of Egyptian independence]] on February 22, 1922..  (See [[History of Egypt under the British]].)  The [[Kingdom of Egypt|new Egyptian government]] drafted and implemented a [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] in 1923 based on a [[parliamentary system]]. In 1924, Zaghlul became [[Prime Minister of Egypt]]. In 1936, Egypt concluded a new [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|treaty]] with the UK. In 1952, the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] of the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]] forced King [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] to abdicate in support of his son [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad]], secured a British promise of withdrawal by 1954–1956, and led to the accession of Egypt's first modern president [[Gamal Abdel-Nasser]].

No later than the close of the 19th Century, a branch of the Pallache family had settled in Egypt, with some remaining in Cairo into the 1950s.

Which members of the family had what foreign citizenship is as yet undetermined, e.g., Spanish under the Decree-Law of 29 December 1948 (''Decreto-Ley de 29 de Deciembre de 1948'') to extend Spanish protection for Sephardic Jews in Greece and Egypt:  &lt;blockquote&gt;'' '''DECRETO-LEY de 29 de diciembre de 1948 por el que se reconoce la condición de súbditos españoles en 1. extranjero a determinados sefardies protegidos de España:'''   Por Canje de Notas efectuado por España con Egipto el dieciséis y diecisiete de enero de mil novecientos treinta y cinco, y con Grecia el siete de abril de mil novecientos treinta y seis, se convino que España continuarla otorgando su patrocinio y documentando, en consecuencia, a una serie de familias sefardies que, desde tiempos del imperIo ottoman, gozaban en aquellos territorios de tal gracia; y a dicho efecto, y como anejo a las referidas Notas, se establecireron unas listas, cuidadosamente seleccionadas, de esos beneficiarios, cuya futura condición de súbditos españoles se preveía en aquellas Notas...''&lt;br&gt;

As community leaders, the Palacci supported Jewish causes inside and outside Egypt.  In 1907, Vita Palacci was serving as president of ''la société de bienfaisence a "Hachemia"'':  &lt;blockquote&gt;''En 1901, fut fondée au Caire une société de bienfaisance israélite dénommée "Hachemia."  Cette institution qui est l'oeuvre exclusive des israélites de Turquie résidant en Egypte, prend de jour en jour un développement sensible.  Pendant le dernier exercice, Hachemia a donne des soins médicaux à 1.000 malades furent visites à raison d'une piastre (0 fr. 25) par visite, sans compter les malades seignés à son compete dans divers hôpitaux du Caire et d'Alexandrie...&lt;br&gt;  L'année dernière, le baron [[Edmond de Rothschild]], lors de son dernier séjour au Cairo, fit a cette société un don de 3.000 fr.  En 2901 Mme la baronne de Rothschild lue fil un don pareil.  &lt;br&gt;Le comité directeur de la Hachemia est composé de personnalités marquantes de Caire.  M. Vita Palacci, le distingué chef de l'importante maison du commerce Palacci fils, Haim et Cie, qui est bien connue en Egypte et au Soudain, en est le president actif et dévoué.  Parmi ses collaborateurs, citons de Dr. Beneroya, le directeur du journal "La Vara"; M.

Ces deux derniers étant membres honoraires théoriquement, actifs, pratiquement.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1901, a Jewish mutual aid society was founded in Cairo called the "Hachemia." This institution, which is a charitable organization for Turkish [Ottoman] Jews residing in Egypt, is making positive advances. Since the last fiscal year, Hachemia has provided medical care to a thousand visiting patients at the rate of one piaster (0.25 French francs) per visit, not including patients cared for and covered by Hachemia in several hospitals in Cairo and Alexandria...&lt;br&gt;Last year, Baron Edmond de Rothschild, during his last visit to Cairo, donated 3,000 francs. In 1901, Baroness de Rothschild made a gift in the same amount.&lt;br&gt;The committee leadership of Hachemia is composed of prominent people of Cairo. Mr. Vita Palacci, the distinguished head of the major commercial house Palacci Sons, Haim and Co., well known in Egypt and in Sudan, is the current and committed president of Hachemia. Among the other members of the leadership are: Dr. Beneroya, the editor of the newspaper "La Vara"; Mr. Talvi, an engineer at the Ministry of Public Works, etc.; Dr. Amster, doctor administering health services; and Dr. Isaac J. Levy of Alexandria, doctor at the Jewish Community Menascé Hospital, of Anti-Tuberculosis League, and the Alexandria Municipality.

After World War I, participation of the ''[[Force Publique]]'' in the East African campaign resulted in a [[League of Nations]] mandate over the previously German colony of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] to Belgium as Belgian Congo (read more at "[[Belgian Congo]]").

In the mid-1940s, Henri Palacci, son of Menahem, son of Aaron (Henri) Palacci, founded "La Coupole" store in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (then Leopoldville, [[Belgian Congo]]), as documented in

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Les commerçants juifs ont contribué à l'émancipation des "indigènes," en les initiant aux produits manufacturés.  Ainsi, les boutiques "Au Chic" du Groupe Hasson et "La Coupole" d’Henri Palacci, ouverts, à Léopoldville, vers 1946, vendent à tous et refusent toute forme de discrimination raciale. Leurs rapports quotidiens avec les colonisés distinguaient les Juifs des autres Blancs. Et lors des évènements tragiques de 1960, aucun Juif ne fut molesté par la foule en colère.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jewish merchants contributed to the empowerment of "indigenous" people by introducing them to manufactured goods.  The shops "Au Chic" (Hasson Group)  and "La Coupole" (Henry Palacci), opened in Leopoldville, around 1946, selling to all and refusing any form of racial discrimination.  Daily contact with colonized Jews differed from other Whites.  And during the tragic events of 1960, no Jew was molested by mobs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  (See "[[Congo Crisis]]" for more on the emergence of the DR Congo.&lt;ref&gt;

===Turkey===
Around 1840, the Pallache home in Smyrna became today's Beth Hillel Synagogue (Turkish ''Bet-Ilel Sinagogu'') and seat of a yeshiva or beit madras.  The synagogue lies in the [[Kemeraltı]] marketplace district in Izmir and is named after Haim or Abraham Palacci.  Professor [[Stanford J. Shaw]] stated it was Haim who founded the ''Beth Hillel Palacci''.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;

According to Jewish Izmir Heritage, "In the 19th century, Rabbi Avraham Palache founded in his home a synagogue named Beit Hillel, after the philanthropist from Bucharest who supported the publication of Rabbi Palache's books.  However, the name 'Avraham Palache Synagogue' was also used by the community."&lt;ref&gt;

"The building had been used as a synagogue and a ''[[Beth midrash|Beit Midrash]]''. The synagogue has not been used since 1960's."    It concludes, "The synagogue was founded by the Palaggi family and is therefore very important."&lt;ref name=BeitHillel&gt;

==Yeshivas==

===Turkey===

Journey into Jewish Heritage states that Haim Palacci founded the ''Beit Hillel [[Yeshiva]]'' in Izmir in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=book-collection&gt;
{{cite web

| accessdate = 2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Current sources are unclear, but it is likely the same as the ''Beit Midrash'' mentioned above.&lt;ref name=BeitHillel /&gt;

===Israel===

A seminary was named in Haim Palachi's honor in [[Bnei Brak]], Israel.&lt;ref name=Pallache-Turkish /&gt;

==Writings==
* Haim Palachi – of 82 publications, 36 (as of September 2016) are listed under: [[Haim Palachi]]
* Many other rabbinical works by other Palache rabbis, including:  [[Abraham Palacci]], [[Rahamim Nissim Palacci]], and [[Joseph Palacci]]
* [[Colette Rossant|Colette (Palacci) Rossant]]:  ''Apricots on the Nile'' (1999, 2004)&lt;ref name=Apricots /&gt;
* [[Eddy Palacci]]:  ''Des étoiles par cœur'' (2012)&lt;ref name=Etoiles /&gt;

==Documented spellings of surname==

As the Pallache settled in new cities with new languages, spellings of the surname changed.  Oftentimes, changes occurred via officialdom.  In the 19th Century, for example, American officials at [[Ellis Island]] would shorten, simplify, or change altogether the spellings of foreigners upon arrival.  In the 20th Century, Turkish officials forced all nationals to adopt surnames under the 1934 [[Surname Law]].

Variations on the Pallache name appear on both Spanish and Portuguese lists of Sephardic names.  For instance, "Palacci" is listed as Spanish Sephardic,&lt;ref&gt;

Samuel Pallache's name appeared in several forms–including variations that he himself used.&lt;ref&gt;citation pending from ''A Man in Three Worlds''&lt;/ref&gt;  A German ''Vierteljarhschrift'' mentions both "Duarte de Palacios" and "Duarte Palache" when referring to the same person, thus making direct equation between the names "de Palacios" and "Palache."&lt;ref&gt;

==Family tree==

The approach that the outline below follows is:  1) use [[Moïse Rahmani]]'s essay "Les Patronymes: une histoire de nom ou histoire tout court" as a base, 2) add findings from the penultimate chapter of García-Arenal and Wiegers's ''A Man of Three Worlds: Samuel Pallache, a Moroccan Jew in Catholic and Protestant Europe'' (1999, 2007), and 3) add further information – all with citations.  The index developed for Abraham Galante's ''Jews of Turkey'' is another major source for the Izmir branch of the family.

=== 16th-17th Centuries Morocco and Netherlands ===
Pallache of the 16th-17th Centuries, who originated from Morocco include:
: '''Moïse Al Palas''' (???–1535), born in Marrakesh, lived in Salonica, died in Venice&lt;ref name=JVL-Palache /&gt;&lt;ref name=Patronymes /&gt;
: '''Isaac Pallache'''(???–1560&lt;ref name=Patronymes /&gt;), rabbi of Fez (mentioned 1588)&lt;ref name=Laredo /&gt;
::  '''[[Isaac Uziel]]''' (???-1622), nephew of Isaac Palacche, rabbi of Amsterdam's second Separhdic synagogue "Neve Shalom"
::  '''[[Samuel Pallache]]''' (ca. 1550-1616), envoy and dragoman of Morocco (1608-1616)&lt;ref name=Patronymes /&gt;&lt;ref name=Laredo /&gt;

==Background==
Born in [[Simrishamn]] in southern Sweden, the youngest of three children, he grew up in [[Uddevalla]], north of [[Gothenburg]], where his parents operated a small printing company. Barnevik was educated at the [[University of Gothenburg]]'s [[School of Business, Economics and Law]] and at [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]. He has received seven [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]] in Sweden, Finland and the U.S., including from [[Linköping University]] (1989) and the [[University of Gothenburg]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary doctors at Linköping University|url=https://liu.se/en/article/honorary-doctors|publisher=Linköping University|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hedersdoktorer [Honorary Doctors]|url=https://handels.gu.se/om_handelshogskolan/fakta_+och+_historia/hedersdoktorer|publisher=University of Gothenburg, School of Business, Economics and Law|accessdate=1 February 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In 1993, Barnevik received the [[IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/weber_rl.pdf |title=IEEE Ernst Weber Engineering Leadership Recognition Recipients |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Barnevik started his professional career in the Swedish company Datema, but soon moved to [[Sandvik]]. In [[Sandviken]], where between the years 1969 and 1970 he hired over 150 people, his employees said "he has some kind of magic in him—you just can't refuse his offer." He developed unique relationships with many of his colleagues which helped him to improve the communication. In 1975, he was promoted to CEO of Sandvik's American operations, Sandvik Steel. Within the next four years he tripled the revenues, grossing $250 million, and turned the company profitable. During his work in the United States, Sandvik started competing against the industry leaders, such as [[General Electric]] and [[U.S. Steel]].

In 1979 he joined [[ASEA]], a leading Swedish heavy industrial company based in [[Västerås]]. In 1987 he decided to merge with its Swiss competitor – [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]]. It was the largest merger at that time. He held the position of CEO of ASEA 1980–87, was CEO of ABB from  1988 to 1996. He was Chairman of Sandvik 1983–2002, Chairman of [[Skanska]] 1992–1997, Chairman of [[Investor AB]] 1997–2002, Chairman of [[AstraZeneca]] 1999–2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrazeneca.at/Documents/AZNews/L040311LouisSchweitzer.doc ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202004831/http://www.astrazeneca.at/Documents/AZNews/L040311LouisSchweitzer.doc |date=2 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman of ABB 1996–2002, Member of the Board of [[DuPont]], USA 1991–1998 and Member of the Board of [[General Motors]], USA 1996-2009. He was also a regular [[Bilderberg Group]] [[List of Bilderberg attendees|attendee]] 1992–2001 and belonged to the group's Steering Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/former-steering-committee-members.html|title=Former Steering Committee Members|work=bilderbergmeetings.org|publisher=[[Bilderberg Group]]|accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his eight years as CEO of ASEA followed by the nine years as CEO of ABB, the company achieved an increase of stock value of 87 times or 30% average per year over the 17 years. Net profit increased 60 times and sales 30 times. Based upon these extraordinary results Barnevik received a one-off payment of 148 million Swiss francs when he retired as CEO in 1996. 2002, six years later under a second succeeding CEO, ABB stock market value plummeted from 54.50 francs in 2000 to just under 15 francs. When ABB's board made the pension payment public, a huge scandal ensued and Barnevik was forced to resign as chairman of Investor, the Swedish investment company controlled by the powerful [[Wallenberg family]], and to hand back a large chunk of his pension to ABB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1866190.stm |work=BBC News | title=ABB ex-bosses pay back benefits | date=11 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/C1256C290031524BC1256B0B003B8C36.aspx |title=Jürgen Dormann succeeds Percy Barnevik as chairman of ABB |publisher=Abb.com |date=21 November 2001 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 2003, Barnevik co-founded charity [[:en:Hand in Hand International|Hand in Hand]] with Dr Kalpana Sankar in Tamil Nadu, India. The charity, which fights poverty through job and business creation, has since grown to include programs in 10 countries: Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, India, Afghanistan and, more recently, Cambodia and Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HiH Where We Work|url=http://www.hihinternational.org/Where-We-Do-It/Where-We-Do-It.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand in Hand’s mission is to work for economic and social empowerment of the poorest and most marginalized people by supporting the development of businesses and jobs. Since 2003, the Hand in Hand network has helped start and sustain 1.3 million businesses and has generated 1.9 million jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hand in Hand International]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Barnevik lives in London. In an interview he once stated that he took a test which stated he was unsuitable for a managerial position.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/percy-barnevik-jag-var-olamplig-som-chef&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnevik|first1=Percy|title=Percy Barnevik on Leadership|publisher=Sanoma|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Providencia F. Paredes''' (1924 – March 18, 2015) was the personal assistant to the [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]].&lt;ref name="jfklibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilrights.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKOH-PP-01.aspx|title=Providencia Paredes Oral History Interview - JFK #1, 1965. - John F.

== Biography ==
A native of [[San Pedro de Macoris]], [[Dominican Republic]], Parades arrived in the United States in 1948 with Francisco Thomen, Ambassador to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the conclusion of the Ambassador’s term in [[Washington, D.C.]], she returned to the Dominican Republic and was reunited with her first child, Hector, who was born in 1945. Several years later, ''Provi'' (as she is known to friends) returned to the [[United States]], where she remarried Gustavo G. Paredes, a former member of the [[Colombia]]n [[Colombian National Armada|navy]] and merchant marines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/style/weddings-gustavo-paredes-elizabeth-alexander.html WEDDINGS; Gustavo Paredes, Elizabeth Alexander] from ''The New York Times'', date September 19, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and gave birth to her second child, Gustavo, in 1954.

In 1957, Senator [[John F. Kennedy]]’s personal secretary, [[Evelyn Lincoln]], introduced Paredes to Senator Kennedy. After meeting Mrs. Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, Provi began working for the Kennedys in their [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] home. Upon Senator John F. Kennedy’s election as President, Paredes became a U.S. citizen and accompanied the Kennedys to the [[White House]] and was employed as Mrs. Kennedy’s private attendant. Her role was noteworthy in that she was the only staff member of [[Hispanic]] descent in the Kennedy administration's inner circle. Chief among her duties was the care and oversight of the First Lady’s extensive wardrobe and personal accessories.

During the Kennedy White House years, Paredes traveled widely with both the President and Mrs. Kennedy. She accompanied President Kennedy on trips and official state visits to [[Puerto Rico]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[France]], [[Mexico]], and [[England]], and was a companion to the First Lady on trips to Mexico, [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], [[Turkey]] and [[Switzerland]]. While many trips were official business, others were personal.

After President Kennedy’s assassination, Paredes worked for [[Robert F. Kennedy]] until his untimely death, and for Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] briefly. In 1969 she assumed a position in the [[United States Postal Service]] Library Division from which she retired in 1992 after thirty one years of public service. After her death in May 1994, Mrs. Onassis remembered Ms. Paredes in her final will, leaving her a total of US$50,000 in gratitude for her assistance and friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtuallawoffice.com/onasis.html Last Will and Testament of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis] from ''Law Office of Sean W. Scott''&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Paredes and her son, Gustavo, who was a good friend of Ms. Onassis's son, [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]] attended her burial at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on May 24, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/us/death-of-a-first-lady-the-overview-jacqueline-kennedy-onassis-is-buried.html?pagewanted=2 DEATH OF A FIRST LADY: The Overview; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Is Buried] from the ''[[New York Times]]'', date May 24, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Paredes and her family maintained a close relationship with many members of the Kennedy family.

Paredes died on March 18, 2015 at the age of 90.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/03/23/providencia-paredes-the-woman-behind-jackie-kennedy-dies-at-90/|title=Providencia Paredes – the woman behind Jackie Kennedy – dies at 90|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bolsa de Comercio Rosario 1.jpg|thumb|The original Rosario Stock Exchange]] 
The '''Rosario Board of Trade''' ({{lang-es|'''Bolsa de Comercio de Rosario'''}}, ''BCR'') is a non-profit making association based in [[Rosario]], in the [[provinces of Argentina|Province]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]]. Founded on August 18, 1884, it serves as a forum for the conduct of trade negotiations in several markets including grain, oilseed, agricultural products and their by-products, as well as securities and other assets.

== Grain Market ==
The Physical Grain Market (''{{lang|es|Mercado Físico de Granos}}'') of the BCR is the most important in Argentina in terms of its volume of operations, and provides reference prices for the national and international markets. Most of the country's production of [[cereal]]s and [[Vegetable fats and oils|oilseeds]] is traded within it, especially [[soybean]]. The [[Greater Rosario|region]] around Rosario contains more than 80% of the vegetable oil industry of Argentina and its ports, ([[Port of Rosario|Rosario]] and [[San Lorenzo-Puerto General San Martín Port Complex|San Lorenzo-Puerto San Martín]]), handle more than 90% of the Argentine export of soybean and its derivatives.
The Board of Trade additionally operates a complex of laboratories which analyze and provide quality certifications for samples of agricultural products, soil and water.

== Futures Exchange {{anchor|Rosario Futures Exchange}} ==
The Rosario Futures Exchange (ROFEX, ''{{lang|es|Mercado a Término de Rosario}}'') has traditionally been a [[futures exchange]] for [[commodities]] and, in more recent times, for financial products such as [[exchange rate]] and [[interest rate]] options. Its negotiated volume (especially in [[forward contract]]s over [[United States dollar|dollars]]) makes ROFEX the largest futures market in the country.

== Stock Exchange {{anchor|Rosario Stock Exchange}} ==
The Rosario Stock Exchange (''{{lang|es|Mercado de Valores de Rosario}}'', abbreviated MerVaRos) is known as ''{{lang|es|Mercado Argentino de Valores}}'', after the merger with the Mendoza Stock Exchange.

== Livestock Market ==
The Rosario Livestock Market (''{{lang|es|Mercado [[wikt:ganadero|Ganadero]] de Rosario}}'', abbreviated Rosgan) is an important Argentine livestock auction market, notably for [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Official site of [http://www.rosgannet.com.ar/ingles Rosgan] (livestock auction market)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Operating in a landmark [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] headquarters designed by Raúl Rivero in 1926, the exchange had new offices built during the 1990s. Designed by architect [[Mario Roberto Álvarez]], the new building was completed in 1998.

The company is listed on [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM]], a sub-market of the [[London Stock Exchange]], and is headquartered in London with offices in New York City and Chicago, Illinois.

==History==
Rosslyn Analytics was founded in 2007 by Charles Clark and Hugh Cox.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7030">'''&lt;big&gt;Rural management&lt;/big&gt;''' is the study of planning, organising, directing, and controlling of [[rural area]],  [[Cooperative|co-operatives]], [[agribusiness]] and allied fields. It merges the knowledge of [[Management|management studies]] and applying it in the rural context. Most of the courses are designed  in such a way that the concepts taught in the class is applied in the real life through training in the rural areas through [[Case study|case-studies]] and interaction with the rural people

== Rural Management Institutes in India ==

There are many academic institutions within India  offering courses on Rural Management.  Notable among them are Institute of Rural Management, Anand (www.irma.ac.in), KIIT School of Rural Management (KSRM), Bhubaneswar (ksrm.ac.in) and Xavier University, Bhubaneswar (ximb.ac.in).  They offer either two years' Post Graduate Diploma in Rural Management or Two Years' Masters in Business Administration (MBA-Rural Management).

Rural Management graduates work in the areas like sustainable rural livelihoods, agri-business management, cooperatives, climate change, micro-finance, [[corporate social responsibility]], [[Natural resource management|natural resources managemen]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t, rural marketing, commodity trading and marketing and  [[social entrepreneurship]].

Apart from the classroom based courses, IRMA and KSRM provide opportunities to their rural management students to undergo three field segments (internships) of 10–11 weeks duration. In other words, the curriculum is designed to make it contextual to develop rural areas through experiential learning, live projects.

== Growing scope of Rural Management in India ==
India has close to 4,000 management schools that produce over 300,000 graduates every year. But the country has  few niche management schools focusing on the rural sector. Rural management schools  produce less than 1,000  rural managers. The small number is surprising considering the importance of the rural sector, or Bharat, in India's economy.

According to a study by global consulting firm Accenture, the rural economy accounts for 50 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. It also makes up 70 per cent of the country's population and 50 per cent of the work force. About 75 percent of new factories built in the past decade have come up in rural India, which accounts for 75 per cent of all new manufacturing jobs. Since 2000, per capita GDP has grown at 6.2 per cent a year in rural India compared with 4.2 per cent in urban areas. And in terms of spending, Bharat has trumped India by a mile. Between 2009 and 2012, Indians in the countryside spent $69 billion compared with $55 billion in big towns and cities.

Harish Manwani, chairman of Hindustan Unilever Ltd, says rural India is a powerhouse with the potential to add $1.8 trillion, or the equivalent of the current GDP, to the country's economy. But this potential can be realised only if Bharat and India merge.

Mainstream management schools have not ventured into rural management for many reasons. The rural management courses are very niche and they call for students with a different set of attitudes. The teaching approach is also different. Most mainstream schools may not be prepared to handle such subjects," says Professor Abraham Koshy, professor of marketing at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.  Experts say there is room for more rural management schools. For a country of India's size and the number of problems we face, there is a need for lot more such institutions. There is a  need to create a lot of rural managers who are potential agents of change.

Rural Management is one such specialisation which gives you the chance to contribute towards uplifting and betterment of those sections of the society, where the light of development is yet to reach. The purpose of the rural managers is to promote sustainable, eco-friendly and equitable socioeconomic development of rural area  through professional management of their institutions and organisations. Previously, only a few people opted for this challenging course but nowadays, a lot of students are opting for this course of rural management as they want to learn and showcase their skills to ensure that the performance in the rural sector is enhanced..

== Unique areas of Rural Management in terms of course and career ==
The MBA (Rural Management) programme is unique in the sense that in addition to traditional management courses such as Project Management, Accounting, Quantitative Techniques, Managerial Analysis and Communication, Finance, Marketing Management, many specialised courses focusing on management of rural sector are offered.

Agribusiness Management, Rural Production and Livelihoods, Rural Finance and Commercial Banking, Natural Resources Management and Climate Change, Rural Marketing, CSR Management, Micro Finance, ICTs for Development, Innovation in Rural Development and Enterprises, Policy and Programme Interventions in Rural Development are some of the courses especially focusing on the rural sector.

Anyone who completes MBA (Rural Management) has the advantage of having career opportunities in any general management area.  In addition to that, Rural Management graduates alone are preferred in specific areas mentioned above.

(Dr) '''Tan Chin Tuan''' ({{zh|s=陈振传|t=陳振傳|p=Chén Zhèn Chuán}}; 21 November 1908 – 13 November 2005) was a [[Peranakan]] banker and philanthropist who is often credited with helping to build up [[Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation]] (OCBC).

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Born in 1908, he was the son of prominent Hokkien businessman, Tan Cheng Siong, a General Manager of Oversea-Chinese Bank Ltd. Tan Chin Tuan grew up under the harsh conditions of the [[Great Depression|Great Depression (1930)]], having lost his father during his schooling years.  Educated at [[Anglo-Chinese School]], he was compelled to leave school at the age of seventeen to begin work at the Chinese Commercial Bank (which merged with Ho Hong Bank that same year to form OCBC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tan Chin Tuan|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_155_2004-12-27.html|website=Singapore Infopedia|publisher=National Library Board Singapore|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
Tan served as the managing director of OCBC from 1942 to 1972 and as chairman from 1966 to 1983. Upon his retirement, he was made honorary life president of the bank, the only person ever thus honoured.

Tan established his reputation as a sharp corporate banker with a keen eye for spotting opportunities to create value for the bank and its shareholders.  His ideas and thinking were instrumental in the building of OCBC bank.

Between the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s, he was chairman of ten blue-chip companies.  Upon his retirement of these companies, Tan was made their Honorary Life President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tan Chin Tuan's Biography|url=http://www.geni.com/people/TAN-Chin-Tuan-%E9%99%88%E6%8C%AF%E4%BC%A0/6000000025343675571|website=Gini|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philanthropist ===
Tan Chin Tuan was a strong advocate of lifelong learning. In 1984, he donated £350,000 to the [[Needham Research Institute]] (NRI) in Cambridge, United Kingdom and the library block at NRI is named after him.  NRI is currently one of the top three centres for learning Chinese science and technology in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Needham Legacy and China’s Genius|url=http://lampinfoo.com/2008/09/15/needham-legacy-and-chinas-genius/|website=Lam Pin Foo: My Reflections on Life|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997, he committed S$2.5 million towards the [[Nanyang Technological University]]'s exchange programme in engineering. Named the Tan Chin Tuan Exchange Fellowship, it funds research collaborations between NTU and overseas institutes.

Tan established the Tan Chin Tuan Foundation (TCTF) on 10 April 1976 to share with society the rewards of his highly illustrious career. He rendered assistance to the deserving and provided services that helped uplift the less fortunate. Today, the contributions of TCTF reflect the founder’s philosophy of how money should be channelled for social good. The foundation strives to support causes and projects that are viable, sustainable and well-managed with definable social outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Tan Chin Tuan Foundation|url=http://tanfoundation.com.sg/the-foundation/about-the-foundation/|website=Tan Chin Tuan|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, TCTF continues his commitment towards advancing educational causes through professorships, scholarships and bursaries, and establishing strategic programmes in institutions of higher learning.

== History ==

=== The Silk Industry in Zurich ===
As early as 1237, raw silk was documented to be brought to Zurich from [[Como]] via [[Walenstadt]]. At that time, shipments were transported in primitive vehicles on poorly paved roads, narrow bridle paths, and dangerously labile, unstable footbridges&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hundert Jahre Seidentrocknungs-Anstalt Zürich, 1846–1946.|last=Jenny|first=Hans|publisher=Orell Füssli AG|year=1946|isbn=|location=Zurich|pages=4|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Back then, transporting silk was much more laborious and hazardous than it is today. To reach [[Chur]] and adjacently Walenstadt, traders were forced to pass the [[Septimer Pass]] and the old imperial road. From there, the goods were transported to Zurich by boat. Upon arrival, the silk was unloaded near the [[Wasserkirche|Helmhaus]] Bridge and sold in a store near the [[Fraumünster]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Silk Drying ===
[[File:Trocknungsöfen.jpg|thumb|The drying ovens of the "Seidentrocknungsanstalt Zürich" around 1918]]
In order to determine the curb weight of [[silk]], it must be completely dry. However, this process is heavily influenced by the atmospheric humidity, since the material absorbs moisture from the air and thereby increases in weight&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hundert Jahre Seidentrocknungs-Anstalt Zürich, 1846–1946.|last=Jenny|first=Hans|publisher=Orell Füssli AG|year=1946|isbn=|location=Zurich|pages=19|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property of raw silk makes it difficult to accurately determine its weight, which created the need for independent “weighing institutes”. These institutes were established to dry all traders’ silk according to a standardized method and thereby ensure a fair silk trade. Per definition, a silk conditioning institute is “a neutral authority whose test results are recognized as binding by both contractual parties."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hundert Jahre Seidentrocknungs-Anstalt Zürich, 1846–1946.|last=Jenny|first=Hans|publisher=Orell Füssli AG|year=1946|isbn=|location=Zurich|pages=24|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first silk conditioning institute opened on April 8, 1724 in [[Turin]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It would remain the only institution of its kind until Jean-Louis Rast-Maupas opened a similar institution with improved procedures in [[Lyon]] in 1779. During the [[French Revolution]], Rast-Maupas's “Condition” was closed for nearly two years. During this time, three similar institutes opened in Lyon, setting off a fierce competition. In 1805, [[Napoleon]] granted the Lyon [[Chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]] the exclusive right to dry silk, resulting in the establishment of a state institution in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hundert Jahre Seidentrocknungs-Anstalt Zürich, 1846–1946.|last=Jenny|first=Hans|publisher=Orell Füssli AG|year=1946|isbn=|location=Zurich|pages=22|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the establishment of institutions in Turin, Lyon, and [[Milan]], others quickly followed in [[Elberfeld]], [[Krefeld]], [[Saint-Étienne]], [[Vienna]], [[Zürich|Zurich]], and, finally, in [[New York City|New York]], [[Yokohama]], [[Kobe]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Guangzhou]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Founding ===
The silk industry experienced a considerable boom around 1846. It became obvious that it would be disadvantageous to remain dependent on foreign silk conditioning institutions,  a “provisional committee” decided to establish a silk drying institute in Zurich. On September 22nd, 1846, the constitutive assembly approved the statutes. Nearly 50 silk experts gathered in the “[[Zunfthaus zur Zimmerleuten|Zunfthaus zur Zimmerläuten]]” to elect a [[board of directors]] for the newly founded institute. Colonel Heinrich von Muralt-Stockar was elected Chairman of the Board,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hundert Jahre Seidentrocknungs-Anstalt Zürich, 1846–1946.|last=Jenny|first=Hans|publisher=Orell Füssli|year=1946|isbn=|location=Zurich|pages=28|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lord Schwarzenbach-Imhof was appointed as director. Three days later the board met for the first time, and operations began on June 1st, 1847. At that time, they did not yet have any practical experience in silk drying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hundert Jahre Seidentrocknungs-Anstalt Zürich, 1846–1946.|last=Jenny|first=Hans|publisher=Orell Füssli AG|year=1946|isbn=|location=Zurich|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three individuals were primarily responsible for the founding of the Silk Drying Institute in Zurich. They became aware of silk drying while travelling abroad and wanted to establish the practice in Switzerland in order to make the local silk trade less dependent on foreign entities. All three were politically active and well-known throughout the city.

Colonel Heinrich von Muralt-Stockar served as Chairman of the Board for 14 consecutive years, he was the son of Hans Conrad von Muralt, the former mayor of Zurich. At the age of 27, he took over his father’s silk business “Heinrich de Daniel Muralt” and served as president of Zurich’s “Baukollegium”, and the “Dampfschifffahrtsgesellschaft”.

Cavalry Captain Conrad Bürkli, a senior commander of the fire brigade, was a close friend of von Muralt's. He had been the proprietor of the Johann Georg Bürkli silk trading company since 1811, as well as a member of the city council.

Johann Heinrich (Henry) Bodmer-Pestalozzi was a member of the Bodmer zur Arch family and owner of the family’s eponymous silk production company. The company was among the first in Switzerland to produce silk [[gauze]].

=== Facilities ===
[[File:Neubau Gotthardstrasse.jpg|thumb|The newly constructed headquarters in April 1932 at the Gotthardstrasse 61, Zürich]]
Between 1846 and 1863, the Silk Drying Institute resided in the “Äusseren Tiefenhof”, where the [[headquarters]] of the [[Zurich Cantonal Bank]] are located at present. The facility, located in the center of Zurich, covered roughly 5,525 square feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hundert Jahre Seidentrocknungs-Anstalt Zürich, 1846–1946.|last=Jenny|first=Hans|publisher=Orell Füssli AG|year=1946|isbn=|location=Zurich|pages=31|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1st, 1849, a new branch was opened in [[Basel]], which would later detach itself organizationally and financially from its parent company in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hundert Jahre Seidentrocknungs-Anstalt Zürich, 1846–1946.|last=Jenny|first=Hans|publisher=Orell Füssli AG|year=1946|isbn=|location=Zurich|pages=33|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the company’s rapid growth and an acute need for additional space, a new facility was acquired in 1861: the “weissen Bären,” located on the corner of Bärengasse and Talstrasse. The company officially moved to the new facility in 1863, after two years of renovations and furnishing. The facility remained in use until 1932, when it was replaced by the company’s present-day headquarters in [[Enge (Zürich)|Zurich’s Enge]] district, which officially opened on April 14th, 1932. Although an expansion of the company’s operational space had been in discussion since as early as 1889, the implementation was delayed, due to [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hundert Jahre Seidentrocknungs-Anstalt Zürich, 1846–1946.|last=Jenny|first=Hans|publisher=Orell Füssli AG|year=1946|isbn=|location=Zurich|pages=77|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Zurich Silk Industry in Its Prime ===
In the second half of the [[19th century]], free trade policies and technological advances such as the [[telephone]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph,]] introduced a period of prosperity for the silk trade. The [[Gotthard railway|Gotthard railway connection]], completed in 1882, and the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 made international trade significantly easier. On account of its constant improvements to the silk drying procedure and improved logistics and storage, Zurich became the center of the international silk trade.

=== The War and Post-War Eras ===
Zurich retained this status during World War I despite the difficult conditions, which caused interruptions and declines in sales. Many banks and other businesses closed following the outbreak of war. This resulted in a shortage of liquid funds, which soon impacted the silk trade. The home countries of the institutions in Milan, Turin, Lyon, Krefeld, and later [[Tokyo]] and New York, had entered the war. This favored the silk industry in Zurich tremendously, hence it achieved record sales between 1915 and 1917.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== World War II ===
While the transition from a peacetime economy to a wartime economy posed fewer issues in [[World War II]] than it did in World War I, the war years were even tougher for the silk trade. As a national economy, Switzerland was largely cut off from foreign markets. While the silk trade was exempt from rationing measures, it was subordinated to the Swiss Textile Syndicate along with all other branches of the textile industry. The export guarantee issued by the [[Swiss Federal Council]] eased the situation for exports only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hundert Jahre Seidentrocknungs-Anstalt Zürich, 1846–1946.|last=Jenny|first=Hans|publisher=Orell Füssli AG|year=1946|isbn=|location=Zurich|pages=65|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1944, silk experienced a certain upswing due to the temporary shortage of [[wool]] and [[cotton]]. Following the war, the silk business began to flourish once again. Large supplies of Italian silk were exported to Switzerland, which stimulated the local economy.

== Present ==

=== Decline of the Swiss Silk Industry ===

Following the development of [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic fibers]], particularly after World War II, the Swiss silk industry began processing less and less real silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D13965.php|title=Seide|last=AHB|first=Liliane Mottu-Weber /|date=|website=HLS-DHS-DSS.CH|language=German|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;As a result, the demand for traditional silk drying methods declined significantly. In 1970, the company responded to the shifting market conditions by focussing on textile testing and changing its name to Testex AG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.testex.com/de/leistungen/wer-wir-sind/#box01|title=Le Fil Rouge, Jubiläumsausgabe zum 160-jährigen Bestehen der ehemaligen Seidentrocknungsanstalt Zürich.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.testex.com|language=German|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This laid the foundation for a new reorganization to a modern testing institute. In 1993, Testex joined the Oeko-Tex Association and began conducting human ecological tests on textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.testex.com/en/leistungen/wer-wir-sind/#box01|title=Milestones TESTEX AG.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.testex.com|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testex Today ===
Today, little remains of the silk drying institute. The boom eras of Zurich’s silk industry are a thing of the past, and the Swiss textile industry has long been in decline. The "Seidentrocknungsanstalt", however, has managed to avoid a similar fate. Today, Testex AG is one of the largest textile testing companies in the world, and has experienced significant growth since the turn of the century. At the end of 2006, Testex AG engaged 66 employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzz.ch/articleEPOV6-1.86374|title=Von der «Sidetröckni» zum Hightech-Betrieb - das Textilprüfinstitut Testex: Ist der Teddybär resistent gegen Speichel?|date=2006-12-29|work=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|access-date=2017-08-14|language=de-CH|issn=0376-6829}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in 2017 the company employs over 200 people in 20 locations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.testex.com/en/leistungen/wer-wir-sind/|title=TESTEX - Gruppe|last=|first=|date=|website=www.testex.com|language=English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Times Square Red, Times Square Blue''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written by [[science fiction]] author [[Samuel R. Delany]] and published in [[1999 in literature|1999]] by the [[New York University Press]]. The book is a compilation of two separate [[essay]]s: ''Times Square Blue'' and ''...Three, Two, One, Contact: Times Square Red''.

==Contents==

===''Times Square Blue''===
''Times Square Blue'' is a first-hand narrative of Delany's (often referred to as "Chip," or, occasionally, as "The Professor") sexual exploits in [[Times Square]]'s [[adult movie theater|pornographic movie theaters]] with other men (some [[homosexuality|homosexual]], some [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]]) from 1960 through the mid-1990s. He also describes, in detail, his relationships with these men inside and outside the theatres.

===''...Three, Two, One, Contact: Times Square Red''===
The second essay in the book discusses the nature of [[social relation]]s within the realm of [[urban studies]]. Delany proposes two kinds of relationships, "contact" and "networking," and analyzes the content and benefits of each. He also refers extensively to [[Jane Jacobs]]' ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.
