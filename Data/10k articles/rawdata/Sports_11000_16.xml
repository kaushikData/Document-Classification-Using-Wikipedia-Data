The '''1200 Guineas Stakes''' was a [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[Great Britain]] open to [[thoroughbred]]s aged five years. It was run at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] and was one of the most important races of the second half of the 18th century.

==History==
The 1200 Guineas was established in 1753 to be first run during [[Easter]] week of 1757. It was established by the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], [[Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven|3rd Duke of Ancaster]], [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough|3rd Duke of Marlborough]], [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|2nd Marquess of Rockingham]], [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire|Marquess of Hartington]], [[John Manners, Marquess of Granby|Marquess of Granby]], [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin|2nd Earl of Godolphin]], [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|2nd Earl of Northumberland]], [[Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton|10th Earl of Eglinton]], [[Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond|3rd Duke of Richmond]], [[John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower|1st Earl of Gower]] and Thomas Duncombe. They agreed the race was to be run over the Beacon course at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] and would be open to five-year-old horses and mares. They paid a 100 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] subscription each to enter their horse and all runners would carry nine [[Stone (unit)|stone]].&lt;ref name="turf"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pick |first1=William |last2=Johnson |first2=R. |title=The Turf Register (Vol. I) |publisher=A. Bartholoman, High-Ousegate |year=1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race was initially to be run for five consecutive years from 1757, but was subsequently renewed in 1762.&lt;ref name="turf"/&gt;

1729 was the 33rd English [[cricket]] season since the earliest known [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] was played. Details have survived of seven [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]]. The earliest known [[innings]] victory is believed to have happened and the earliest known surviving [[cricket bat]] dates from the season. The earliest known reference to cricket in the county of [[Gloucestershire]] has been found.

== Important matches ==
The following matches are classified as [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important]]:&lt;ref name="status" group="fc"&gt;First-class cricket was officially defined in May 1894 by a meeting at [[Lord's]] of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) and the [[county cricket|county clubs]] which were then competing in the [[County Championship]]. The ruling was effective from the beginning of the 1895 season. Pre-1895 matches of the same standard have no official definition of status because the ruling is not retrospective and the [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]] designation, as applied to a given match, is based on the views of one or more substantial historical sources. For further information, see [[First-class cricket]], [[Forms of cricket]] and [[History of cricket]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Stead v Gage was alternatively titled [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] (Stead's XI) v [[Sussex, Surrey &amp; Hampshire cricket team|Sussex, Surrey &amp; Hampshire]] (Gage's XI). It was an 11-a-side match played for 100 guineas with "some thousands" watching.&lt;ref name=DC/&gt; The match seems to have resulted in the earliest known [[innings]] victory as Gage's XI "got (within three) in one hand, as the former did in two hands, so the Kentish men (i.e., Stead's XI) threw it up". The report added re [[Thomas Waymark]] that "a groom of the [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|2nd Duke of Richmond]] signalised himself by extraordinary agility and dexterity".&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;

The report then states that "(Waymark) turned the scale of victory, which for some years past has been generally on the Kentish side".&lt;ref name=DC/&gt; This indicates that inter-county matches had been played for many years previously and that there was keen rivalry with each team seeking ascendancy: i.e., as "champions" or, given a 1728 reference to the superiority of Kent, at least of "bragging rights".&lt;ref name=LL/&gt;

==County cricket==
It appears that Gage's XI was representative of three counties and so should perhaps be considered a [[Non-international England cricket teams|Rest of England team]] formed to challenge Kent, who had hitherto enjoyed: "the scale of victory, which for some years past has been generally on the Kentish side" (see above). The match on 24 June involved a team specifically named Sussex, but the result is unknown. Despite losing to Gage's team in August, Kent under the patronage of Edwin Stead is generally believed to have been the strongest county team&lt;ref name="champs" group="fc"&gt;"Champion County" is an unofficial seasonal title proclaimed by media or historians prior to December 1889 when the official [[County Championship]] was constituted.&lt;/ref&gt; of the 1720s.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/histories/champions.html |title=Champion cricket teams since 1728 |last=Leach |first=John |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2008 |accessdate=28 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829042341/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/histories/champions.html |archivedate=29 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oldest cricket bat.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The oldest [[cricket]] [[cricket bat|bat]] still in existence dates from 1729. Note the shape, which is more like that of a modern-day hockey stick than a modern-day cricket bat. It is kept in the Sandham Room in the Member's Pavilion at [[the Oval]]]]

There is a bat in [[The Oval]] pavilion which belonged to John Chitty of [[Knaphill]], [[Surrey]]. Dated 1729, it is the oldest known bat.&lt;ref name=RB&gt;Bowen, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; It looks more like a [[field hockey]] stick than a modern cricket bat but its curvature was to enable the batsman to play a ball that was always rolled or skimmed along the ground, as in [[bowls]], never pitched. Pitching began about 30 years later and the straight bats used nowadays were invented in response to the [[pitched delivery bowling|pitched delivery]].&lt;ref name=LL/&gt; 

Dr [[Samuel Johnson]] attended the [[University of Oxford]] from October 1728 until the following summer and later told [[James Boswell]] that cricket matches were played there. Boswell mentioned this in his ''Life of Samuel Johnson''.&lt;ref name=M38&gt;Maun, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tuesday, 5 August''. [[Gentlemen of Middlesex cricket team|Gentlemen of Middlesex]] v [[Gentlemen of London cricket team|Gentlemen of London]] was announced, to be played at the [[The "Woolpack" cricket ground, Islington|"Woolpack", Islington]]. The venue was described as "in the Field behind the ''Woolpack'' Back Gate near [[Sadler's Wells]]", the match having a stake of £50 per side. Several sources have listed the match in 1728 due to an error in original research. As London were playing Dartford on the same day (see above), this match was as advertised "gentlemen only".&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;&lt;ref name=LL/&gt; 

A local game in [[Gloucester]] on Monday, 22 September is the earliest known reference to cricket in [[Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref name=RB/&gt;

== History ==

On 30 May 1983, the 21 International Federations governing the sports included at the time on the programme of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games decided to form the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF).

ASOIF was formed, as stated in the first article of its constitution 'to co-ordinate and to defend the common interests of its members' and to 'ensure close co-operation between its members, and members of the Olympic Movement and other organisations'. These needs were identified in order to preserve the unity of the Olympic movement while maintaining 'the authority, independence and autonomy of the member International Federations.'

The members of ASOIF meet once a year in a General Assembly. The General Assembly usually precedes the joint meeting between the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee and the International Federations where a multitude of topics are discussed in the common interests of the Olympic Movement.

In 2015, the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 had proposed five new sports in response to the new flexibility provided by Olympic Agenda 2020, the IOC’s strategic roadmap for the future of the Olympic Movement. Olympic Agenda 2020 gives host cities the option of suggesting new sports and events for inclusion in their edition of the Games. Karate, skateboarding, sports climbing, surfing and baseball/softball will be added to the Olympic Programme in Tokyo 2020. ASOIF has amended its statutes to enable IFs “governing sports included within the events programme for a specific edition of the Summer Olympic Games” to become “Associate Members”. 

ASOIF is administered by an executive body, the Council, which consists of seven individual members, most of which are presidents of Summer Olympic International Federations.

The ASOIF General Secretariat is located in Lausanne and is administered by the ASOIF Executive Director.

The '''Austrian National League''' ({{lang-de|Österreichische Eishockey-Nationalliga}}) is a former second tier ice hockey league in [[Ice hockey in Austria|Austria]].  For the [[2012–13 Inter-National League season|2012–13]] season, it was replaced by the [[Inter-National League]].

==Decline==
With the conclusion of the [[2011–12 Austrian National League season|2011–12]] season, seven of the twelve teams left the league. Two teams, [[Dornbirner EC|Dornbirner]] and [[HC TWK Innsbruck|TWK Innsbruck]] were invited to join the [[Austrian Hockey League]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Bahrain national cricket team''' is the team that represents the country of [[Bahrain]] in [[international cricket]]. The team is organised by the [[Bahrain Cricket Association]] (BCA), which became an [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] affiliate member in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Countries/37.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|work=cricketarchive.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[ICC members|associate member]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="Assoc"/&gt; The Bahraini national side made its first international appearance in 1979, at a tournament with [[Kuwait national cricket team|Kuwait]], [[Qatar national cricket team|Qatar]], and Sharjah (one of the [[United Arab Emirates national cricket team|United Arab Emirates]]). Its first appearance in an [[Asian Cricket Council]] tournament came at the [[2004 ACC Trophy]] in Malaysia; since then, Bahrain has regularly appeared in ACC events. Bahrain has also made several appearances in [[World Cricket League]] tournaments, but was relegated back to regional tournaments after finishing fifth at the [[2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Six|2013 Division Six]] event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/2/2381/Other_Matches.html Other matches played by Bahrain] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all [[Twenty20]] matches played between Bahrain and other [[List of International Cricket Council members|ICC members]] after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/672322|title=All T20 matches between ICC members to get international status|publisher=[[International Cricket Council]]|date=26 April 2018|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some racing drivers have used '''doping in auto racing''' to enhance their performance. Deemed unsafe and illegal by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]]. Appendix A to the [[International Sporting Code]] determines which substances are banned and mandates penalties.

==Appendix A to the International Sporting Code==
The Appendix regarding doping in auto racing was added on 1 December 2010 after consultation with the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA). The regulations apply to all FIA and national sanctioned events. The FIA adopts the banned substance list issued by WADA. The FIA has added [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[beta blockers]] to the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROHIBITED IN PARTICULAR SPORTS|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/prohibited-list/prohibited-in-particular-sports/beta-blockers|website=WADA|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FIA will test at random from a pre determined pool of drivers. The national sanctioning body will test a number of athletes during their events.

In case of a positive doping test, the driver in question will be disqualified, have his/hers results forfeited and has to return all their winnings. In case of negligence by the driver will only be disqualified for the event on hand. In case of a second violation the driver will be banned from the sport for six months. More severe penalties could be imposed, depending on the circumstances. The driver has to pay back price money won. A fine of up to € 15.000 can be imposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendix A - FIA Anti-Doping Regulations - 2017|url=http://www.fia.com/file/51922/download/12835?token=imYs-6AK|website=FIA|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==INDYCAR==
Since the series inception in [[1996 Indy Racing League|1996]], [[INDYCAR]] has a substance abuse policy in place. The policy is applied to all series sanctioned by INDYCAR, currently the [[IndyCar Series]], [[Indy Lights]], [[Pro Mazda]], [[USF2000]] and [[Global MX-5 Cup]]. Drivers, crew and officials can be subjected to testing (depending on the series). The INDYCAR organisation can subject subjects to test at random. INDYCAR may require a drug test also in events of 'reasonable suspicion'. Reasonable suspicion includes, but is not limited to, violent temper or an accident during the event. When a driver is tested positive for [[performance enhancing drugs]] (PED) the driver will be suspended for one year. A fine of $ 5.000 wil also be imposed. With a non-PED positive test (alcohol for example) the driver will be suspended for no less than sixty days. A fine of $ 2.500 wil also be imposed. 

In the case of multiple violations the driver will be penalized again. The height of the penalty will be determined by the specific circumstances. The driver may return to competition after psychological and medical evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 INDYCAR Substance Abuse Policy|url=https://hardcards.indycar.com/Resources/pdfs/2017/2017_INDYCAR_Substance_Abuse_Policy.pdf|website=INDYCAR|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASCAR==
[[File:TSM AJ Allmendinger - 2015 - Stierch 3.jpg|thumb|left|A.J. Allmendinger]]
[[NASCAR]] has its own anti doping regulations. The substance abuse policy was first implemented in the late 1980s. Flaws in the systems allowed drivers to continue to use banned substances. One notorious case was that of [[Aaron Fike]]. After being arrested for [[heroin]] possession, Fike admitted using [[black tar heroin]] during race weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former truck racer Fike admits using heroin on race days|url=http://www.espn.com/racing/nascar/truck/news/story?id=3336865|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2009]], [[Jeremy Mayfield]] failed a drug test for [[methamphetamine]] with his stepmother declaring Mayfield has used meth as early as 1998. After sitting out the initial penalty, Mayfield tested positive again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASCAR driver Mayfield fails another drug test|url=https://pilotonline.com/sports/auto-racing/nascar-driver-mayfield-fails-another-drug-test/article_b96c0760-dd15-563a-90a1-ed66805966ec.html|website=The Virginian Pilot|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayfield could return to NASCAR competition after completing the Road to Recovery. The driver however has questioned the credibility of the testing laboratory recognized by NASCAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeremy Mayfield adamant he didn't use drugs, won't go through NASCAR recovery program|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/news/jeremy-mayfield-video-drug-suspension-nascar-lawsuit-recovery-program-meth-stolen-property/2zqljx2u39ia1i97fz2qpk4x8|website=Sporting News|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the case of Fike and the case of Mayfield, the policy was overhauled. [[A.J. Allmendinger]] was one of the first big name drivers failing a drug test. Allmendinger tested positive for [[Adderall]]. Allmendinger was suspended, fired by team owner [[Roger Penske]], and returned to competition 2,5 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASCAR: The Curious Case of AJ Allmendinger|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1362398-nascar-the-curious-case-of-aj-allmendinger|website=Bleacher Report|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the nature of the NASCAR garage, drivers and crew members can be tested by the organisation, especially because performance enhancing drugs can be abused by crew members. Crew chief [[Todd Parrott]], for driver [[Aric Almirola]], tested positive for an 'undisclosed substance'.  The NASCAR policy is consistent with the FIA's policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Previously suspended crew chief has completed NASCAR Road to Recovery program|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/7/todd-parrott-reinstated-nascar-road-to-recovery.html|website=NASCAR|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2018 28-year old [[Spencer Gallagher]] won his first [[2018 NASCAR Xfinity Series|NASCAR Xfinity Series]] race on 28th of April. On May 1st Gallagher failed the drug test. Gallagher was suspended indefinitely and agreed to join the Road to Recovery program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2018/05/02/spencer-gallagher-issued-substance-abuse-policy-penalty-nascar/|title=Gallagher issued Substance Abuse Policy penalty|last=|first=|date=|website=NASCAR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;n 

After testing positive for a banned substance, the person in question is suspended indefinitely. To return to competition the person needs to complete the NASCAR Road to Recovery and have a Road to Recovery Plan approved. The plan includes treatment, rehabilitation, counseling and other measures necessary to prevent repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALLMENDINGER TO PARTICIPATE IN RECOVERY PROGRAM|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2012/07/25/aallmendinger-recovery-program.html|website=NASCAR|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==USAC==
The [[United States Auto Club]] has implemented a substance abuse policy since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USAC CONTINUES MOTORSPORTS LEADERSHIP ROLE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY ANNOUNCEMENT|url=http://www.usacracing.com/content/view/7281/1/|website=USAC|accessdate=11 September 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213185622/http://www.usacracing.com/content/view/7281/1/|archivedate=13 February 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; USAC also has a self determined list of banned substances, with the exclusion of prescription medication (used in accordance with the purpose and instruction). The policy states that USAC has to have reasonable suspicion that banned substances are used. The policy states (but is not limited to) a list of symptoms for drug and/or alcohol use. USAC also has the right to test at random. With a positive drug or alcohol test the USAC Director of Competition may suspend the driver indefinitely. After the failure of a drug test, the driver can return to competition after a negative drug test after the suspension period. After a failed alcohol test, the driver only has to sit out the suspended period. In both cases the driver will be subjected to more frequent tests in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Substance Abuse Policy|url=http://www.usacracing.com/assets/files/allseries/forms/substanceabusepolicy.pdf|website=USAC|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It is located on land that was part of the grounds of [[Langtons|Langtons House]], built in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.havering.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4709 Havering Borough Council site]&lt;/ref&gt; The park, known as Langton Park, was the home of [[Hornchurch Cricket Club]] and was a major venue from 1785 to 1793. At that time, the Hornchurch club was representative of [[Essex county cricket teams|Essex]] as a county.

The earliest recorded first-class match at Langton Park was in May 1785 when Essex played [[Middlesex county cricket teams|Middlesex]] and the last was [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/173.html Essex v MCC] in May 1793.&lt;ref name="S&amp;B"&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies'', Volume 1 (1744-1826), Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt; The ground faded from the records as the [[Napoleonic Wars]] progressed and Essex ceased to have a first-class county team.

By 1889, the Hornchurch club had moved from Langtons to nearby [[Grey Towers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hornchurchcc.org/index.php?module=PostWrap&amp;page=history.htm Hornchurch CC site]&lt;/ref&gt; It is still used by the club as a secondary location to [[Harrow Lodge Park]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hornchurchcc.org/Location.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53729">'''[[Rugby union]]''' is a team sport played between two teams of fifteen players. It is known for its rich terminology.

This is a general glossary of the '''terminology''' used in the [[sport]] of rugby union. Where words in a sentence are also defined elsewhere in this article, they appear in italics. 
__NOTOC__
{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}

== 0-9 ==
'''22'''

The 22&amp;nbsp;m line, marking {{convert|22|m}} from the tryline.

'''89'''

An "89" or ''eight-nine move'' is a phase following a ''scrum'', in which the ''number 8'' picks up the ball and transfers it to [[Scrum-half (rugby union)|number 9]] (''scrum-half'').

'''[[99 call|99]]'''

The "99" call was a policy of simultaneous retaliation by the [[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa]], (the 99 comes from the British emergency services telephone number which is 999). The tour was marred by on-pitch violence, which the match officials did not adequately control and the relative absence of cameras compared to the modern game made citing and punishment after the fact unlikely. The Lions' captain, Willie John McBride (Ireland), therefore instigated a policy of "one in, all in" - that is, when one Lions player retaliated, all other Lions were expected to join in the melee or hit the nearest Springbok. By doing so, the referee would be unable to identify any single instigator, and so would be left with the choice of sending off all or none of the team. In this respect, the "99" call was extremely successful - no Lions player was sent off during the tour.

==A==

'''Accidental offside'''

see ''[[#O|Offside]]''

'''Advantage'''

"Advantage" is the period of time after an infringement in which the non-offending side have the opportunity to gain sufficient territory or tactical opportunity to negate the need to stop the game due to the infringement. The referee will signal advantage with his arm out horizontally toward the non-infringing team. If no tactical or territorial advantage is gained, the referee will whistle and give the decision that had been delayed. If sufficient advantage is gained, the referee will call "advantage over", and play will continue. The Advantage Law allows the game to flow more freely, and not stop for every minor infringement, giving no incentive for a player to commit "intentional" fouls. 

An example of the application of advantage would be if Team A knocked the ball on (technical offence, conceding a scrum) but a Team B player picked the ball up and made a run forwards before being tackled.

'''Advantage line'''

Also called the ''gain line''. It is an imaginary line drawn across the centre of the pitch when there is a breakdown in open play, such as a ''ruck'', ''maul'' or ''scrum''. Advancing across the gain line represents a gain in territory.

'''[[Ankle tap]]'''

An ankle-tap or ''tap-tackle'' is a form of tackle. It is used when the player carrying the ball is running at speed and a defending player is approaching from behind. Even if the defender is not able to get close enough to the ball-carrier to wrap his arms around him in a conventional tackle, he may still be able to dive at the other player's feet and, with outstretched arm, deliver a tap or hook to the player's foot (or feet) causing the player to stumble.

== B ==

'''[[Ball back]]'''

If the ball enters touch, then play is restarted by a ''line-out'' at the point where the ball left the field of play. The exception to this is if the ball is kicked into touch on the full. In this case, a ''line-out'' is taken at the point from where the ball was kicked, and not from where it entered ''touch''.

Ball back is waived in certain circumstances:

* If the kicking player is inside his own 22m line when he receives and then kicks the ball. If the player receives the ball outside the 22 then retreats back into the 22 and kicks into touch on the full it is a lineout at the nearest point on the touchline from where the ball was kicked.
* If a side elects to kick a ''penalty'' into touch.

'''Bill'''

Australian name given to the (William Webb Ellis) [[Webb Ellis Cup]].

'''Black dot'''

A mark in the centre of the crossbar connecting the goal posts, usually black in colour, used as an aid to kickers with their aiming. A player scoring a try in the centre of the goal line, that is beneath the posts, can be said to have scored "under the black dot".

'''Blindside'''

The narrow side of the pitch in relation to a scrum or a breakdown in play; it is the opposite of ''openside''. The [[Flanker (rugby union)|blindside flanker]] is expected to cover the opposing team blindside at ''scrum'' and ''breakdown''.

The Blindside of the scrum is the side that the opposing scrum half is feeding the ball from. The Open side is the other side, 'Open' in this situation, means unimpeded. 

'''[[Blitz defence]]'''

The blitz defence is a defensive technique similar to the defence used in [[rugby league]]. It relies on the whole defensive line moving forward towards their marked man as one, as soon as the ball leaves the base of a ''ruck'' or ''maul''. The charge is usually led by the [[Centre (rugby union)|inside centre]].

The idea of this technique is to prevent the attacking team gaining any ground by tackling them behind the gain line and forcing interceptions and charged down kicks. However, the defending team can be vulnerable to chip kicks and any player breaking the defensive line will have lots of space to play because the defence are running the other way and must stop, turn and chase.

'''Blood bin'''

It is also called [[blood replacement]]. A player who has a visible bleeding injury may be replaced for up to fifteen minutes (running time not game time), during which he or she may receive [[first-aid]] treatment to stop the flow of blood and dress the wound. The player may then return to the [[pitch (sports field)|pitch]] to continue playing.

'''[[Rugby union bonus points system|Bonus points]]'''

Bonus points are a method of deciding table points from a rugby union match. It was implemented in order to encourage attacking play throughout a match, to discourage repetitive goal-kicking, and to reward teams for "coming close" in losing efforts.
*Under the standard system, 1 bonus point is awarded for scoring 4 (or more) tries and 1 bonus point for losing by 7 points (or fewer).
*The [[National Rugby League (France)|French professional league]] replaces the four-try bonus point with a point for a win in which the winning team scores at least 3 more tries than its opponent. In addition, the "losing" bonus point requires a margin of defeat of 5 or fewer points.
* Australia's [[National Rugby Championship]] uses the same system as France, except that a losing bonus point is awarded if the margin of defeat is 8 points or fewer.

'''Box-kick'''

This is a kick taken from behind a scrum, normally by the scrum-half, in which he turns away from the scrum facing the touchline, and kicks the ball back over the scrum into the clear "box" of space behind the opposition to allow his own team to chase through and regain the ball in undefended territory .

'''Breakdown'''

The breakdown is a colloquial term for the short period of open play immediately after a tackle and before and during the ensuing ruck. During this time teams compete for possession of the ball, initially with their hands and then using feet in the ''ruck''.  Most referees will call "ruck" or "hands away" as soon as the ruck is formed. Most infringements take place at the breakdown, owing to the greater variety of possible offences at a breakdown, for example handling in the ruck, killing the ball, offside at the ruck and so on.

==C==

'''Caution'''

A player who deliberately or repeatedly infringes the laws is cautioned, and shown a yellow card. A cautioned player is suspended from playing for ten minutes.

'''Cavalry Charge'''

Typically during a penalty kick or free kick, the attacking players form a line behind their kicker. When signaled, they charge forward. The kicker then tap-kicks the ball and passes to one of the players behind. This move is explicitly forbidden under 10.4(p) and the penalty is a penalty kick.

'''[[Centre (rugby union)|Centre]]'''

They are the players wearing shirts numbers 12 &amp; 13. They are divided into inside and outside centre. The inside centre is also known as the ''[[second five-eighths]]'' in New Zealand.

'''Charge-down'''

When a player makes a defensive clearance kick, but it hits an opponent who has run towards him in an attempt to block it, it is known as a charge-down. These can be good try-scoring opportunities.

'''Choke tackle'''

Tackle in which the tackler tries to keep the ball carrier on his feet and push him backwards before taking him to the ground. This is harder to execute but gives the tackler's side a gain in territory.

'''[[Cibi]]'''

The cibi is a Fijian war dance performed by the [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji national team]] before each of their international matches.

'''[[Try#Conversion|Conversion]]'''

If a team scores a try, they have an opportunity to "convert" it for two further points by kicking the ball between the posts and above the crossbar - that is, through the goal. The kick is taken at any point on the field of play in line with the point that the ball was grounded for the try, parallel to the touch-lines. So it is advantageous to score a try nearer to the posts as it is easier to convert it.

The kick can be either a ''drop kick'' or a ''place kick'' in the 15-man game. However, in [[rugby sevens|sevens]], all conversions must be drop kicks.

'''Counter rucking'''

If a team (usually the team that took the ball into contact) has secured the ball at a ruck, and the other team manage to force them off the ball and secure possession themselves, the defending team are said to have "counter-rucked"

'''[[Crash ball]]'''

It is an attacking tactic where a player receives a pass at pace and runs directly at the opposition's defensive line. The crash ball runner attempts to commit two or more opposing players to the ''tackle'', then attempts to make the ball available to team-mates by ''off-loading'' in the tackle or recycling the ball quickly from the ''ruck''.

By committing players to the tackle, the crash ball runner creates holes in the opposition's defense, thereby creating attacking opportunities for team-mates.

'''[[Crash ball|Crash tackle]]'''

Another name for the ''crash ball'' as mentioned above.

'''Cross-Field Kick'''

A kick which goes from one side of the field to the other and is kicked very high, usually resulting in an aerial battle between an attacker and defender to catch it. This is usually used near the defending team's try-line, often with the catch happening in the in-goal area itself. Most often used when the kicker knows the referee is playing advantage and his team will get a penalty if the kick fails - this is because the kick itself is very risky and likely to result in an interception.

==D==

'''[[Drop goal#Rugby union|Drop goal]]'''

A drop goal is scored when a player kicks the ball from hand through the opposition's goal, but the ball must touch the ground between being dropped and kicked. It is worth three points.

The team awarded a free kick cannot score a dropped goal until the ball next becomes dead, or until an opponent has played or touched it, or has tackled the ball carrier. This restriction applies also to a scrum taken instead of a free kick.

'''[[Drift defence]]'''

The drift defence is a defensive technique which forces the attacking side into an ever shrinking pocket near to the touchline. It operates by the defensive side moving forward and diagonally following the path of the attacking side's ball movements. If used successfully the ball will usually end up in the attacking winger's hands near the line of touch. This player would then find themselves surrounded on one side by a defending outside centre, with the opposing winger opposite and the touchline on his other side. This will prevent a cut-back and allows the Touchline to act as a 16th player. Its disadvantage is that if the attacking team are strong enough to break through the pocket tackle the defending team will have no players spare to cover a breakout.

'''[[Drop kick#Rugby football|Drop kick]]'''

A drop kick is when a player kicks the ball from hand and the ball touches the ground between being dropped and kicked. If a drop kick goes through a goal then it results in a ''drop goal''.

'''Dummy pass'''

An offensive ruse, where the ball carrier moves as if to pass the ball to a team-mate, but then continues to run with the ball himself; the objective is to trick defenders into marking the would-be pass receiver, creating a gap for the ball carrier to run into. If it is successful, the player is said to have "sold the dummy".

'''Dummy runner'''

Another offensive tactic; a player on the attacking team runs towards the opposition as if running onto a pass, only for the ball to be passed to another player, carried on by the ball carrier or kicked forwards. As with a ''dummy pass'', this tactic draws defenders away from the ball and creates space for the attacking team

'''[[Dump tackle]]'''

It is a [[tackle (football move)|tackling]] technique. The tackler wraps his arms around the ball carrier's thighs and lifts him a short distance in the air before forcibly driving him to the ground. The tackler must go to ground with the ball carrier for the tackle to be legal. This technique is useful to completely stop the opponent in his tracks. A dump tackle which drops the ball carrier on his head or neck is known as a ''spear tackle'', and will almost invariably concede a penalty and possibly result in a caution for the tackler. In rugby union, [[World Rugby]] has ruled that a dangerous tackle of this type, sometimes also called a tip tackle, should be punished with a straight red card.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deepsouthrugbyunion.com/images/IRB_Memorandum_re_Dangerous_Tackles.pdf IRB memorandum, Dangerous Tackles, 8 June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==E==

'''Eightman''', '''Eighth-man'''

Alternative name for the [[Number eight (rugby union)|Number 8]]

==F==

'''Five metre scrum''', '''Scrum-five'''

When a scrum offence is committed within 5m of either try line, or a player carries the ball over his own try line and touches it down, the referee will award a scrum on the five metre line; this is to prevent all but the most brutal packs from driving the ball over the try line within the scrum.

'''[[Stiff-arm fend|Fend]]''' or '''"hand off"'''

Fending is the action by the ball carrier of repelling a tackler using his arm. For the action to be legal, the ball carrier's arm must be straight before contact is made; a shove or "straight-arm smash", where the arm is extended immediately before contact or on contact, is illegal and classed as dangerous play.

'''First XV''' or '''First fifteen'''

The preferred starting line-up of a team - more colloquially, the senior team of any club.

'''[[Rugby union positions#6. Blindside flanker &amp; 7. Openside flanker|Flanker]]'''

Also known as breakaways or wing forwards. They are the players wearing shirts numbers 6 &amp; 7. They are the players with the fewest set responsibilities. The player should have all round attributes: speed, strength, fitness, tackling and handling skills. Flankers are always involved in the game, as they are the real ball winners at the ''breakdown'', especially the number 7. The two flankers do not usually bind to the ''scrum'' in a fixed position. Instead, the ''openside'' flanker will attach to the scrum on whichever side is further from the nearer touchline, while the ''blindside'' flanker attaches himself to the scrum on the side closer to the touchline.

'''{{anchor|Fly-half|Flyhalf}}[[Fly-half (rugby union)|Fly half]]''' or '''five-eighth'''

Referred to by a number of different names, including ''first five-eighth'' in New Zealand, this player wears shirt number 10. They are the back-line player most likely to be passed the ball from the scrum-half or half-back, and therefore make many key tactical decisions during a game. Often this player is also the goal kicker as the position requires excellent kicking skills.

'''[[Forward pass#Rugby league and union|Forward pass]]'''

It is called a throw-forward in the laws of the game.

A forward pass occurs when the ball fails to travel backwards in a pass. If the ball is not thrown or passed forward but it bounces forward after hitting a player or the ground, it is not a throw-forward.

If the referee deems it accidental, this results in a ''scrum'' to the opposing team; however deliberate forward passes result in the award of a ''penalty''.

'''Foul play'''

Foul play is defined as the deliberate infringement of the laws of the game.

'''Fourth official'''

A fourth official is one who controls replacements and substitutes. He may also substitute for referee or touch judge in case of injury to either of them.

'''[[Free kick (rugby union)|Free-kick]]'''

Also called ''short arm penalty''. This is a lesser form of the penalty, usually awarded to a team for a technical offence committed by the opposing side such as numbers at the line-out or time wasting at a scrum. A free kick is also awarded for calling a ''mark''.

A team cannot kick for goal and the normal 22m rule applies for kicking for position from a free kick. A Free Kick is signalled by the referee with a bent arm raised in the air.

'''[[Rugby union positions#15. Fullback|Full-back]]'''

They are the player wearing jersey number 15. They act as the last line of defence against running attacks by the opposing three-quarter backs. The full-back is expected to field high kicks from the opposition, and reply with a superior kick or a counter-attack. The full back is sometimes the specialist goal-kicker in a team, taking penalty and conversion kicks.

'''Full house'''

Scoring a ''try'', ''conversion'', ''penalty'' and ''drop goal'' in the same match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Full house for Hernández  at Loftus|url=http://www.planetrugby.com/news/full-house-at-loftus-for-hernandez/|publisher=Planet Rugby|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==G==

'''[[Gain line]]'''

The gain line is an imaginary line drawn across the centre of the pitch when there is a ''breakdown'' in open play, such as a ruck, maul or scrum. Advancing across the gain line represents a gain in territory.

'''[[Bomb_(kick)|Garryowen]]'''

A Garryowen, or up-and-under kick, is a high short punt onto or behind the defending team.

'''[[Goal (sport)|Goal]]'''

A goal is scored when a player kicks the ball through the plane bounded by the two uprights and above the crossbar. A ''drop goal'' or ''penalty goal'' count for 3 points and ''conversions'' count for two.

'''Goal from mark'''

Goal from mark is an antiquated method of scoring. It occurred when a player "[[mark (rugby)|marked]]" and scored a [[Field goal (rugby)|goal]] from there. In the modern game, a goal cannot be scored from a free kick, but in the past the reward for scoring a "goal from mark" (which is a difficult kick to play) was three or four points.  Occasionally referred to as a field goal.

'''Goal line''', '''Tryline'''

Two solid, straight white lines (one at each end) stretching across the entire width of the pitch passing directly through the goal posts which defines the boundary between the "field of play" and the "in-goal".  As the goal line is defined as part of the "in-goal", attacking players can score tries by placing the ball with downward pressure onto the goal line itself.  The base of the goal posts and post protectors are also defined to be part of the goal line.

The goal line is often referred to as the "try line" though that term does not appear in the Laws of the Game.

'''Goose Step'''

A goose step, made famous by Australian [[David Campese]] but now performed by many players, is a running technique where the player slows down and takes a small 'hop' into the air before sprinting off - sometimes in a different direction - upon landing. Its purpose is to confuse the defender, who is often unable to predict the sudden change of pace and direction.

'''[[Group of death]]'''

Is an informal [[sobriquet]] used to describe a situation that often occurs during the [[round-robin tournament|group stage]] of a [[Multi-stage tournament|tournament]], where either (1) ''any'' team in the group could qualify and ''any'' team could be eliminated, or (2) more teams have a legitimate chance to advance to the next stage than allowed by the tournament structure.

Typically, a group of death will see an unusual match-up of heavyweight sides, due to a quirk in the [[seed (sports)|seeding]] system.

'''[[Grubber kick#Rugby football|Grubber kick]]'''

It is a type of kick which makes the ball roll and tumble across the ground, producing irregular bounces making it hard for the defending team to pick up the ball without causing a knock-on. It gives the ball both high and low bounce and on occasions, the ball can sit up in a perfect catching position.

==H==

'''Half-back'''

Can refer to either the [[Glossary of rugby union terms#Scrum-half|scrum-half]] or [[Glossary of rugby union terms#Fly-half|fly-half]], but in New Zealand is exclusively used to describe the scrum-half.

'''Haka'''

The [[Haka (sports)|haka]] is a [[Haka|traditional Māori dance]] performed by New Zealand national teams, most famously the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]], prior to international matches. It serves as a challenge to the opposing team.

'''Hand-off'''

Handing off (also called ''fend'') is the action by the ball carrier of repelling a tackler using his arm. For the action to be legal, the ball carrier's arm must be straight before contact is made; a shove or "straight-arm smash", where the arm is extended immediately before contact or on contact, is illegal and classed as dangerous play.

'''High tackle'''

A high tackle (or head-high tackle) is a form of tackle where the tackler grasps the ball carrier above the line of the shoulders (most commonly around the neck or at the line of the chin and jaw). Executed violently or at speed, a high tackle is potentially dangerous, so are often not just sanctioned with a penalty, but also a yellow or red card.

'''[[Hooker (rugby union)|Hooker]]'''

Hookers traditionally wear the number 2 shirt. The hooker is the player who is in the centre position of the front row of the scrum and who uses his/her feet to 'hook' the ball back. Due to the pressure put on the body by the scrum and the requirement to use both arms to bind to other players (and hence having no free arm to use to support or deflect bodyweight) it is considered to be one of the most dangerous positions to play.

Hookers normally throw the ball in at ''line-outs'', partly because they are normally the shortest of the forwards, but more often because they are the most skillful of the forwards.

'''[[Hospital pass]]'''

Any pass that is made which has the inevitable, unavoidable consequence of the receiver being tackled. This is because the receiver has already been marked and the opposing player is bearing down on the receiver so rapidly that, as soon as the ball is caught, the opposing player smashes into the receiver. Generally made in times of panic or when there is no-one else available, it is called the hospital pass because of the inevitability of a hard tackle.

==I==

'''Interception'''

The gaining of possession by running forward from the defensive line and taking a pass meant for a member of the opposition. The result is similar to the result of a ''line break'', and has a good chance of leading to a ''try''.

==K==

'''Kick-off'''

A coin is tossed and the winning captain either chooses which direction his team shall play, or elects to take the kick that starts the game. Both halves of the match are started with a ''drop kick'' from the centre-point of the halfway line. The kick must cross the opposition's 10-metre line, unless played by a member of the receiving team.  The opposition are not allowed to encroach beyond the 10-metre line until the ball is kicked.

If the ball does not travel 10 metres, goes straight into touch, or goes over the dead ball line at the end of the pitch, the opposing team may accept the kick, have the ball kicked off again, or have a ''scrum'' at the centre.

After a score, the game is restarted from the same place under the same restrictions, with the conceding team drop-kicking the ball to the scoring team. However, in sevens, the scoring team kicks off.

'''Kick tennis'''

Style of play characterised by both teams repeatedly kicking from hand to the opposition, rather than running at the opposition and risking a ''turnover''. So-called because the ball moves back and forth like in a tennis match. It is considered boring to watch and also referred to as aerial ping-pong.

'''Knock-on'''

Also called knock-forward. A knock-on is when the ball unintentionally moves forward after coming into contact with a player above the waist then hits either the ground or another player. It results in a ''scrum'' with the put-in to the opposition. If the ball is intentionally knocked forward it is deemed a deliberate knock-on; the opposition is rewarded with a penalty and the offending player is given a yellow card and sent to the sin bin.

==L==
'''Latcher/Latching on'''

A latcher is a player who binds himself to the ballcarrier in open play in order to add his power and weight to an attempt to ''break the line'' and gain yards. If the defence is able to stop the ballcarrier and hold him up, a ''maul'' usually forms. However latching on does not automatically create a maul.

'''Late tackle'''

A late tackle is a tackle executed on a player who has already passed or kicked away the ball.  As it is illegal to tackle a player who does not have the ball, late tackles are penalty offences (referees allow a short margin of error where the tackler was already committed to the tackle) and if severe or reckless may result in yellow or red Cards.

If a late tackle occurs after a kick and a penalty is awarded, the non-offending team has the option of taking the penalty where the ball landed.

'''Loose head'''

The loose head prop is the player who takes the left hand position on the front row of the ''scrum''. A loose head prop traditionally wears the number 1 shirt.

As the loose head has considerable potential freedom of movement compared to other front row players, the loose head can attempt to play various illegal techniques to divert the push of the opposing pack and is often able to illegally interfere with the ball in the scrum using his free arm.

'''Line break'''

Action by which the player with the ball gets through the opponent's defensive line without being tackled. If there is insufficient cover, or the player has support, line breaks can often lead to tries.

'''[[Line-out (rugby union)|Line-out]]'''

A minimum of two players line up parallel with each other two metres apart between the five-metre and 15-metre lines. The hooker of the team in possession throws the ball in while his opposite number [may] stand in between the touchline and the five-metre line. 

All players not involved in the lineout, except the scrum-half, must retire 10 metres.

The ball must be thrown in straight down the middle of the lineout and the hooker must not cross into the field of play while throwing in. If the throw is not straight then the throw is given to the opposition or a ''scrum'' awarded.

Jumpers can be lifted by their team-mates below the waist, but the opposition's jumpers must not be obstructed, barged or pulled down.

'''[[Line-out code]]'''

It is a coded piece of information, used to communicate intentions about a ''line-out'' within one team in a match without giving information away to the other team. The advantage in line-out comes from knowing in advance how the throw will be made.

'''Line speed'''

The speed with which a ''blitz defence'' closes down the opposing team. A high line speed will make it difficult for the opposition to cross the ''gain line''.

'''[[Second Row (rugby union)|Lock]]'''

Locks or second-row are the players wearing shirts number 4 &amp; 5. Locks are very tall, athletic and have an excellent standing jump along with good strength. This makes them the primary targets at ''line-outs''. They also make good ball carriers, bashing holes in the defence around the ruck and maul. They also have to push in the ''rucks'' and ''mauls''.

==M==

'''[[Mark (rugby)|Mark]]'''

A mark is the place where the game will restart after a stoppage, such as where a scrum-offence or penalty offence occurred, or on the touchline where the ball went out of play (or where the ball was kicked in the case of ball-back).  Marks are generally defined by the referee, or the touch judge when the ball leaves play by the touchline.

Marks can also be defined by a defending player who executes a clean catch (catches the ball before it bounces or touches another player) of a ball kicked by an attacking player if the defender is standing within his/her own 22-metre zone or in-goal.  To "call a mark", the player shouts "Mark!" as he/she catches the ball.  The referee then awards that player a free kick which must be taken by that specific player. (If, for whatever reason, that player cannot take the kick, a scrum is awarded instead.)  If the player is simply a poor kicker he/she is likely to take a 'Tap Kick' and immediately pass the ball to the fly-half or full back who will generally deliver a clearance kick.

Marks can be called when the ball is cleanly caught following a kick by the opposition for any type of kick except a kick off or restart after a score. It is legal, though very unusual, to call a mark from a clean catch of a penalty kick.

'''Maul'''

When a ball carrier is held up (without being tackled) by both an opposing player and a player from his own team, a maul is then considered formed.

The offside line becomes the last foot of the last man on each side of the maul. Players can join in only from behind that team-mate. Anyone who comes in from the sides will be penalised by the referee. Hands are allowed to be used in the maul. If either team deliberately collapses the maul then that side will be penalised by the referee.  (Note that from August 1, 2008, the IRB is conducting a global trial of a modification of this Law which will allow players to deliberately collapse a maul providing the collapse is achieved by pulling from above the waist.)

If the ball does not come out in a timely fashion, the referee will award a scrum to the team that did not take the ball into the maul.

Mauls can only exist in the field of play.  Play that looks like a maul can exist within the in-goal but restrictions on entry to the maul and the need to bind on to a team member do not apply.

'''Medical joker'''

A player signed by a professional club as an injury replacement. The term is directly borrowed from the French ''joker médical'' and is most commonly associated with [[Top 14|France's top league]]; that country has long allowed such signings.

'''Mismatch'''

Situation where a back is one-on-one with a forward. This favours the attacking side, as often forwards are too slow to stop backs, and backs are too small to stop forwards.

'''Mulligrubber'''

The mulligrubber kick is a style of kicking. A mulligrubber is directed towards the ground and forced to bounce. Often used in situations where either the ball needs to be placed in a specific position (i.e. on the try line) or to intentionally stop the opponent from being able to catch the ball on the full.

==N==

'''North''' (to go north, to head north, etc.)

In the days prior to professionalism in rugby union, players would often convert to rugby league — which was a paid sport — thereby becoming ineligible to again play rugby union. In Wales and (to a lesser extent) England, the term "to go north" referred to this change of code, an allusion to the popularity of rugby league in the north of England.

'''Not straight'''

Referee's call when a ''line-out'' throw or the feeding of the ball into the ''scrum'' is unfairly towards the team in possession, preventing any contest for the ball. It is punished by resetting the set piece and giving control of the ball to the opposition.

'''[[Number eight (rugby union)|Number 8]]'''

They are the players wearing shirts number 8. It is the only position that is known only by the shirt number. Number eights must have a good tactical awareness in order to coordinate scrums and ruck moves with the scrum-half. If the ball is at his feet at the back of a scrum, ruck or maul, it is normally the number eight's decision whether to pass the ball out or drive the breakdown on in order to make ground.

==O==

'''Obstruction'''

Offence whereby a player deliberately impedes an opponent who does not have the ball.

'''Off-load pass'''

A short pass made by a player being tackled before he reaches the ground, usually by turning to face a team-mate and tossing the ball into the air for a team-mate to catch.

'''[[Offside (rugby)|Offside]]'''

A player is offside when he/she is forward of the relevant offside line i.e. between the relevant offside line and the opposing team's dead ball line.

In a match, most players will be offside several times but they only become liable for penalty if they do not act to attempt to become onside (which generally means retreat downfield) or attempt to interfere with play.

In open play, only the ball carrier's team (or the team that last carried or deliberately touched the ball) is bound by offside - the offside line for them is the ball.  (Note every player who passes the ball backwards is offside and must attempt to retire.)

An ''accidental offside'' may occur (and be penalised) if the ball carrier accidentally collides with one of his own team's players while that player is attempting to retire behind the ball (or is otherwise in an offside position).

'''Onside'''

A player is onside whenever he or she is behind the relevant offside line for the particular phase of play. Players who are onside take an active part in playing the game.

Previously offside players may be "put onside" by the actions of other players (for example, in a kick ahead in open play, players in the kicker's team in front of the kick are offside but can be put onside by the kicker or any other team member who was onside at the time of the kick running up the pitch past them). So that players can be confident they are now onside and can take an active part in the game, the referee may shout "Onside" or "All Onside".

'''On the full'''

If the ball is kicked into touch without first bouncing inside the field of play it is termed as ball is kicked into touch on the full. The ''line-out'' is then taken from where the ball was kicked, except in situations where it was kicked from inside the ''22''.

'''Openside'''

The broad side of the pitch in relation to a ''scrum'' or a ''breakdown'' in play. The [[Flanker (rugby union)|openside flanker]] is expected to cover the opposing team openside at ''scrum'' and ''breakdown''. It is the opposite of ''blindside''.

'''Overlap'''

Situation where there are more attacking players (typically backs) on one side of the field than there are defending players. An overlap can be used to manufacture a try by forcing the defenders into tackles and offloading to teammates until the defenders have run out.

==P==
'''{{anchor|Pack}}Pack'''

The pack is another name used for the forwards players, particularly when they are bound for a scrum. 

'''Passing'''

A pass is to transfer a ball to a teammate by throwing it.  Passes in rugby must not travel forwards.  There are different varieties of pass, including the flat, direct spin pass; the short, close-quarters pop pass; and the floated pass - a long pass which an advancing player can run onto at pace.

'''[[Penalty (rugby union)|Penalty]]'''

Penalties are awarded for serious infringements like dangerous play, offside and handling the ball on the ground in a ruck.  Penalties are signalled by the referee with a straight arm raised in the air. Players can also receive red and yellow cards, as in [[soccer|Association football]].

The offending team must retire 10 metres (or to their goal line if closer) for both penalties and free kicks. A team can either kick for goal, ''tap'' and run the ball, take a scrum or kick directly into touch with the resulting line-out awarded to them.

'''Penalty kick'''

If a side commits a ''penalty'' infringement the opposition can take the option of a ''place kick'' at goal from where the infringement occurred (or, if the offence occurred when a player was in the process of kicking the ball, the non-offending team can opt to take the kick from where the ball landed which may be more advantageous). This is called a penalty kick. If successful, it is worth three points.

'''[[Penalty try]]'''

A [[penalty try]] awarded if the referee believes a team illegally prevented a try from probably being scored. As of 2018, penalty tries score an immediate seven points, with no conversion having to be taken. Generally a penalty try is awarded when the try-preventing offence cannot be easily attributed to a single individual, such as when a team repeatedly deliberately collapses a scrum near its own tryline. When the prevention of the try is due to an individual, a yellow card is a more common punishment.

'''Phase'''

A phase is the time a ball is in play between breakdowns. For example, first phase would be winning the ball at the lineout and passing to a centre who is tackled. Second phase would be winning the ball back from the ensuing breakdown and attacking again.

'''Pitch'''

The official name of a rugby playing field.  Dimensions are 100m long by 70m wide.

'''[[Place kick]]'''

The place kick is a kicking style commonly used when kicking for ''goal''. It typically involves placing the ball on the ground. To keep the ball in position, a mound of sand or plastic tee is sometimes used.

'''Pop pass'''

A very short ''pass''.

'''[[Professional foul#Rugby union|Professional foul]]'''

A professional foul is a deliberate act of foul play, usually to prevent an opponent scoring. It is punishable by a yellow card.

'''[[Prop (rugby union)|Prop]]'''

They are the players wearing shirts number 1 &amp; 3. The role of both the props is to support the hooker in the scrum and to provide support for the jumpers in the line-out. The props provide the main power in the push forward in the scrum. For this reason they need to be exceptionally big and strong.

==R==

'''Red card'''

In International matches, red cards are shown by the referee to players who have been ordered off the pitch, which results in the player being removed from the game without being replaced. This usually occurs when a player is guilty of serious foul play, or violent conduct or for committing two offences resulting in cautions (yellow cards).

Red cards are also commonly used in non-international matches in precisely the same manner as in International matches but there is no regulation requiring their use.  (i.e. in a domestic match, a referee may dismiss a player without actually displaying a red card.)

'''Red zone'''

This is a term most commonly used by coaches to describe the area of the pitch between the try line and around 22 metres out, in which it is most likely a try may be scored or conceded.

'''Restart'''

The kick taken from the centre line after the opposition have scored points.

'''[[Round the corner kicking]]'''

A style of place-kicking in which the kicker, instead of facing directly toward the goal-posts, approaches the ball from an angle and swings his kicking leg in an arc.

'''Ruck'''

A ruck is formed when the ball is on the ground and two opposing players meet over the ball.  The offside line becomes the last foot of the last man on each side of the ruck and players compete for the ball by attempting to drive one another from the area and to 'ruck' the ball backwards with their feet.

Rucks commonly form soon after tackles, but can form anywhere in the field of play where the ball is on the ground.

Handling the ball while it is in the vicinity of a ruck is a penalty offence.  (Though modern practice allows a player on the ground to support the ball with his/her hands and for the player who is acting as scrum half to 'dig' for the ball once possession has been secured.)

If the ball remains contested and does not come out of a ruck after about five seconds, the referee will award a scrum to the team he considers to have been moving forward in the ruck.

==S==

[[File:Scrum ASM Clermont-Saracens.jpg|thumb|Scrum between ASM Clermont-Auvergne and Saracens.]]
'''[[Scrum (rugby union)|Scrum]]'''

The eight forwards from each team bind together and push against each other. The scrum-half from the team that has been awarded possession feeds the ball into the centre of the scrum from the side most advantageous for his hooker (which is typically the side of [[Prop (rugby union)|loose head prop]]).

The ball must be fed straight down the middle of the tunnel and the hookers must not contest for the ball until it is put in. If they do, a free-kick is awarded for "foot up".

The scrum is taken again if the ball comes straight out of the tunnel or if it collapses. If the scrum wheels (rotates) due to pushing more than 90 degrees the scrum is reformed and awarded to the other side.  Pulling in an attempt to unbalance the other side or to assist in rotating the scrum is a Penalty Offence.

'''{{anchor|Scrum-half|Scrumhalf|Scrum half}}[[Scrum-half (rugby union)|Scrum half]]'''

Also known as a '''half-back''' (especially in New Zealand), they are the players traditionally wearing shirt number 9. Scrum halves form the all-important link between the forwards and the backs. They are relatively small but with a high degree of vision, the ability to react to situations very quickly, and good handling skills.

They are often the first tackler in defence and are behind every scrum, maul or ruck to get the ball out and maintain movement. They put the ball into the scrum and collect it afterwards. Scrum halves generally also act as "receiver" in the line-out to catch the ball knocked down by the forwards. (The receiver is a member of the line-out and so stands within 10 metres of it and may join the line once the ball is thrown.)

'''{{anchor|Selector|Selectors}}[[Selector (sport)|Selector]]'''

A person who is delegated with the task of choosing players for a team. Typically the term is used in the context of team selection for a national, county, state or provincial representative side, where the selector, or "selection panel", act under the authority of the relevant national or provincial administrative body.

'''Set piece'''

Collective term for the scrum, line-out and sometimes the restart.

'''Shoeing'''

At the ''breakdown'' a ''ruck'' commonly forms over the players involved in the tackle.

Where players who are on the ground on the opposition side of the ruck do not move away quickly enough, players on their feet may be tempted to "help" them move by pushing them away with their boots.

This potentially dangerous act is illegal and if done deliberately (or recklessly) may result in penalties and ''yellow'' or ''red cards''.

'''Short arm penalty'''

See ''free kick''

'''[[Penalty box|Sin bin]]'''

The notional area where a player must remain for a minimum of ten minutes after being shown a ''yellow card''.  In high level games, the sin bin is monitored by the ''fourth official''.

'''[[Sipi Tau]]'''

Sipi Tau is a Tongan war dance performed by the [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga national team]] before each of their international matches.

'''[[Siva Tau]]'''

Siva Tau is a Samoan war dance performed by the [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa national team]] before each of their international matches.

'''[[Spear tackle]]'''

A spear tackle is a dangerous tackle in which a player is picked up by the tackler and turned so that they are upside down. The tackler then drops or drives the player into the ground often head, neck or shoulder first.

Spear tackles are particularly dangerous and have caused serious injury including spinal damage, dislocations and broken bones in the shoulder or neck. On rare occasion, even death can occur.

Spear tackles are taken very seriously by the various Union discipline committees and can result in lengthy playing bans.

'''[[Experimental law variations|Stellenbosch Laws]]'''

The Stellenbosch Laws were a set of experimental laws of rugby union considered by World Rugby, then known as the International Rugby Board (IRB), from 2006 through 2008. The trials ended in late 2008, with the IRB choosing to adopt roughly half of the proposed changes.

==T==

[[File:Tackle on Nicolas Bézy.jpg|thumb|Tackle during a game between the [[Stade toulousain]] and [[Aviron Bayonnais]].]]
'''[[Tackle (football move)|Tackle]]'''

A tackle takes place when one or more opposition players [tackler(s)] grasp onto the ball carrier and succeed in bringing/pulling him/her to ground and holding them there.

Once briefly held, the tackler(s) must release the tackled player who must then him/herself immediately release or attempt to pass the ball so that play can continue.

'''Tap kick'''

A tap kick is a type of kick used by players at penalties or free kicks to meet the regulation that requires the ball must be kicked a visible distance before a player may pass or run with it.

In a tap kick, the player momentarily releases the ball from his hands and taps it with his foot or lower leg and then quickly catches it again. The player will then generally try to run forward with the ball.

'''Tap-tackle'''

Despite its name, a tap tackle is a not actually a tackle as the ball carrier is brought to ground by a form of trip, is not actually held on the ground and may attempt to get up and continue to run.  A tap tackle is used when a defending player is unable to get close enough to the ball carrier but is able to dive at the other player's feet and, with outstretched arm, deliver a tap or hook to the player's foot (or feet) causing the player to stumble.  At speed, this will often be sufficient to bring the ball-carrier down, allowing a team-mate of the tackling player to retrieve the ball or provide sufficient delay for the defending team to organise a defence.

'''Ten Metre Law'''

The Ten Metre Law is a form of offside which is designed to prevent injury to a defending player who attempts to catch a ball that has been kicked ahead by the attacking side.

In the normal Law of Offside in open play, it is possible for an offside player to be put onside by actions of the opposing team.  This ability to be put onside by a member of the opposing team does not apply if the offside player was within 10 metres along the field of a defending player waiting to catch the ball and the offside player remains offside until either he/she retreats onside or is put onside by a member of their own team.

'''[[Test match (rugby union)|Test match]]'''

International rugby union matches with full (Test) status are called Test matches.

'''Tight Head'''

The tight head prop is the player who takes the right-hand position on the front row of the ''scrum''. A tight head prop traditionally wears the number 3 shirt. He is named the tight head since in the scrum he will have an opposition player bind to both his left- and right-hand sides, meaning his head is unexposed to the side of the scrum, as opposed to the loose head, whose left-hand side is exposed.

'''TMO'''

Television match official (TMO), commonly called the [[video referee]].

'''[[Touch (rugby)|Touch]]'''

Touch is the area outside and including the two touch-lines which define the sides of the playing area.  As the touch-lines are not part of the playing area they are part of touch. The ball, and players carrying the ball, are not considered to be in touch until they touch the floor.

[[File:Touch judge.jpg|thumb|Touch judge.]]
'''[[Touch judge]]'''

The touch judge is an official who monitors the touch-line and raises a flag if the ball (or player carrying it) goes into touch. Touch judges also stand behind the posts to confirm that a goal has been scored following a penalty kick or conversion of a try.

'''Truck and trailer'''

A colloquial term for an accidental obstruction. "Truck and trailer" occurs when a player carrying the ball leaves a maul, along with one or more of his teammates.  Once the ball carrier leaves the maul, the maul is over, and if the ball carrier's teammates are in front of the ball carrier and prevent defending players from making a tackle, the defending team will be awarded a scrum. If the incident of truck and trailer is judged to be deliberate or the latest in a series of similar infringements, a penalty may be awarded instead.

{{clr}}
[[File:Dragons vs Leinster welsh try Celtic League 9 may 2008.jpg|thumb|Try during a game between Newport Gwent Dragons and Leinster in the Magners League]]
'''[[Try]]'''

This is the primary method of scoring. A try is worth five points. It is scored when a player places the ball on the ground with ''downward pressure'' in the in-goal area between (and including) the goal-line and up to but not including dead ball line of the opposition's half.  (As the goal posts and post protectors are also part of the goal-line, touching the ball down against the base of these is also a try.)

There is no such thing as an "own try". If you touch the ball down in your own in-goal area, it results in a twenty-two metre drop out or a five-metre ''scrum''.

'''Tunnel'''

When a ''scrum'' is formed, the gap between the legs of the three players from each team who form the 'front row' is called the 'tunnel'.

'''Turnover'''

When a team concedes possession of the ball, particularly at the breakdown, they are said to have turned the ball over to the other team.  This can happen due to defending players stealing the ball from an isolated attacker, ''counter rucking'', a ''knock on'', an intercepted pass or the ball not emerging from a maul (wherein the referee awards the scrum feed to the opposing team).

'''Twenty two metre drop-out'''

A drop kick is taken from behind the 22m line if a team touches down in its own in-goal area but did not carry the ball over the try line, or if the ball is kicked over the dead ball line from any other play other than the kick-off.

The ball only needs to cross the line, but if it goes directly into touch a scrum is awarded to the receiving team at the centre-point of the 22m line.

==U==

'''Uncontested scrum'''

Scrum in which, due to absence of key specialist forwards through injuries or yellow cards, the safety of the scrum cannot be guaranteed. In an uncontested scrum, the players form a scrum but the two teams do not push against each other or compete for possession.

'''[[Bomb (kick)|Up and under]]'''

An up and under or a Garryowen kick, is a high short punt onto or behind the defending team.

'''Use it or lose it'''

If a maul stops moving forward the referee will often shout "use it or lose it" to the team in possession of the ball. This means they must pass the ball within a five-second time period. If they do not, the referee will call a scrum and the team not in possession at the beginning of the maul will be given the feed.

==V==

'''Video Referee'''

Also called TMO (Television Match Official). This is the official who monitors the match in television recorded matches. He is the person who could be called upon by the referee if he is unaware of the outcome of a rugby situation. A good example is a try that is obscured from view i.e. under numerous players.

==W==
'''Wheeling'''

A scrum that has rotated through 90 degrees or more is said to have "wheeled". The referee will order the scrum to be reset, with the ball being turned over if the attacking team is deemed to have been deliberately or repeatedly wheeling the scrum.

'''[[Wing (rugby union)|Wing]]'''

The players wearing shirts numbers 11 and 14 are the left and right wingers. Wingers must be fast runners and agile in order to evade tackles and have excellent ball-handling skills in order to pass and receive the ball at pace.

==Y==

'''Yellow Card'''

In International matches, a yellow card is shown to a player who has been cautioned to indicate "temporary suspension" for repeated or deliberate infringements of the rules.  The offending player is sent to the “sin bin” for at least 10 minutes while his team must play a man short. A player who is temporarily suspended cannot return to the pitch until the first break in play after his/her 10-minute suspension is completed.

In domestic matches, yellow cards are commonly used in exactly the same manner as in International matches but this is not required by regulation so a referee may order the temporary suspension of a player without showing a yellow card.

'''Harder Stadium''' is a 17,000 seat, outdoor [[multi-purpose stadium]] on the campus of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]].  It serves as the on-campus [[association football|soccer]] stadium for both the men's and women's programs.  It is also currently used occasionally by the university's club [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[lacrosse]] teams and previously served as the home for the [[American football|football]] team.

==History==
[[File:Isla Vista Killings Memorial Service.JPG|thumb|left|185px|Over 20,000 were in attendance for a memorial service for the [[2014 Isla Vista Killings]].]]
The stadium was built in 1966 and is named after Theodore "Spud" Harder, a former coach of the Gauchos' [[college football|football]] team. It hosted [[Vince Lombardi]] and the [[Green Bay Packers]] who trained there ahead of the 1967 [[Super Bowl I|Super Bowl]]. The UC-Santa Barbara football team played their home games at Harder Stadium until football was cut after the 1972 season due to budget cuts.  UCSB brought football back as a non-scholarship sport in 1983 and by 1987 was playing a full [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] and [[NCAA Division III|III]] schedule.  In 1992, the [[NCAA]] ruled that [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] colleges must play at the Division I level in all sports; UCSB and a few other universities attempted to form a non-scholarship Division I-AAA level, but the effort failed and UCSB eventually dropped football.  The stadium has a capacity of 17,000 people, and currently is the largest stadium on California's [[Central Coast of California|Central Coast]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  Along with the [[University of California, Santa Barbara Events Center|UCSB Events Center]], it is one of the more well-attended athletic venues in the [[Central Coast of California|Central Coast]].

Harder Stadium hosted a memorial service for the victims of the [[2014 Isla Vista Killings]]. Guests in attendance included UC President [[Janet Napolitano]], and over 20,000 students, staff, alumni, and community members. The stadium seats were filled over capacity as thousands more sat on the grass field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ktla.com/2014/05/27/thousands-expected-at-memorial-planned-for-ucsb-victims-in-isla-vista/#axzz32wMgQFQ9|title=Thousands Honor Isla Vista Victims at UCSB Memorial Service|work=KTLA|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Soccer legacy==
[[File:Harder Stadium Santa Barbara CA.JPG|thumb|right|245px|Harder Stadium in September 2006 looking northwest towards the [[Santa Ynez Mountains]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]]]]
Harder Stadium sees most of its present-day use as a [[association football|soccer]] stadium to the [[UCSB soccer|UCSB men's soccer]] and women's soccer teams. The stadium hosted the final three matches of the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Tournament|2010 College Cup]].  However, a number of professional club and international teams have played in Harder Stadium as well.

===UC Santa Barbara teams===
Due to the success of the men's program, the stadium has hosted numerous NCAA soccer playoff games in addition to the regular season games.  Despite the men's program recent success, it was the women's program who first brought the NCAA Tournaments to Harder Stadium.  The women hosted the first soccer NCAA Tournament game in a 1985 4-3 victory against [[Cal State Hayward]].  In total, the women's program has held 4 NCAA Tournament matches at Harder Stadium, bringing such opponents as the [[Wisconsin Badgers]], [[Stanford Cardinal]], and [[Hartford Hawks]].

The men's program hosted their first men's NCAA Tournament game in 2002, blanking the [[University of San Diego|San Diego Toreros]] 2-0.  In total, they have hosted 9 NCAA Tournament games.

In 2004, 11,214 fans saw UCSB defeat [[VCU Rams|Virginia Commonwealth]] 4-1 to reach the [[NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Championship|College Cup]] (NCAA Soccer's "Final Four").  After the game, a group of students celebrated by carrying one of the soccer goals out of the stadium. They had planned to throw it into the Pacific Ocean (about 1/3 mile away), but were stopped by a combination of law enforcement down the block and tiring out from the weight of the goal.

However, in 2006, the UCSB won the [[2006 Division I Men's College Cup]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Meanwhile, 2,000 miles away at Harder Stadium, a group of rowdy students marched down to the stadium from their homes and attempted the same feat. This time the group succeeded in their quest, throwing the soccer goal off of a cliff at the beginning of the 6600 block of [[Del Playa Drive]].

In 2009, the NCAA awarded UCSB and Harder Stadium the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Tournament|2010 Division I Men's College Cup]], which is the "Final Four" of Division I men's soccer.

On September 24, 2010, the UCSB gaucho fans set a record on the highest attendance at any NCAA (on campus) soccer match. UCSB beat the visiting UCLA team (2-0) in front of 15,896 who attended the game.

Additional UCSB teams that use the stadium for select contests are the UCSB women's lacrosse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsbwlax.com|title=UCSB Women&amp;#39;s Lacrosse|work=ucsbwlax.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; men's lacrosse&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucsbmlax.com&lt;/ref&gt; and rugby&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsbrugby.com|title=Personal Injury Class Action Lawsuits|work=ucsbrugby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; teams. These teams are part of the UCSB Recreation Department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recreation.ucsb.edu/|title=University of California, Santa Barbara -         HOME|work=ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and open to all students.

===Other teams===
Due to the large capacity of Harder Stadium, it is often used by professional teams exhibition games.  In 1991, the [[United States women's national soccer team|US Women's National Team]] played there before the [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup]]. Likewise, the [[United States men's national soccer team|US Men's National Team]] played there in 1994 against the [[Romania national football team|Romanian National Team]].

Club teams also have played at Harder Stadium. In March 2004, the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] and [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] played a pre-season exhibition in Santa Barbara. Following the success of [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] teams at Harder, in March 2006 &amp; 2007, the UC Santa Barbara men's team played exhibition matches against the [[Columbus Crew]] while in July 2006, [[C.D.S.C. Cruz Azul|Cruz Azul]] and [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] played.  March 2007 also saw [[Shizuoka Sangyo University|Shizuoka Sangyō University]] of Japan played off against UCSB.  March 2009 saw [[Club América]] and [[Monarcas Morelia]] played,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Zant |authorlink= |title=Harder Is a Happy Home for Soccer |url=http://www.independent.com/news/2009/mar/31/harder-happy-home-soccer/ |newspaper=[[Santa Barbara Independent]] |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while UCSB has scheduled to play the [[Mexico national under-17 football team|Mexican U-17 National Team]].

==Non-sporting activities==
Every year, the school's [[University of California, Santa Barbara Associated Students Program Board|Associated Students Program Board]] have thrown a free day-long party, known as [[Extravaganza (Music Festival)|EXTRAVAGANZA]], at Harder Stadium.  Previous bands to have played at the festival include [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[No Doubt]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], [[T.I.]], [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[Coolio]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[The Black Eyed Peas]], [[Jane's Addiction]], [[MxPx]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Eve 6]], [[Pepper (band)|Pepper]], [[Slightly Stoopid]], [[Ludacris]], [[Nas]], [[Hellogoodbye]], and [[E-40]].

Harder Stadium also houses 18 art studios located beneath the seating risers. They are primarily used by graduate students and faculty.

'''John Borland (Jock) Wadley''' (1914 – March 1981) was an English journalist whose magazines and reporting opened Continental [[cycle racing]] to fans in Britain.
Wadley covered 18 [[Tour de France|Tours de France]] from 1956. He worked for the British weekly, ''The Bicycle'' and then started and edited the monthlies ''Coureur'' (later ''[[Sporting Cyclist]]'') and ''International Cycle Sport''. He also wrote a number of books.

==Cycling origins==
Wadley began cycling with the [[Colchester]] Rovers club when he was 14. He and a friend, Alf Kettle, were between the towns of Kelvedon and Coggeshall when they took a wrong turning into a farm track by moonlight, riding by the light of [[acetylene]] lamps. Kettle called Wadley "Willy", because it was what all new members were called. He said it was "like the [[Tour de France]]". It was the first time Wadley had heard of the race, which was still in the era of daily stages that started at dawn and rode on unsurfaced roads. He wanted to know more.
He went to the world track championships in Paris when he was 19 and came home starry-eyed over riders like Jeff Scherens and [[Lucien Michard]]. He ordered the daily paper ''[[L'Auto]]'', which organised the Tour, from a newsagent in Colchester. The man warned him it cost 1½d (1p or about 3 US cents) and that the cost was extravagant.

==Journalism==
Wadley joined ''The Bicycle'' soon after it started, in February 1936, and became the magazine's foreign correspondent. The paper opened in opposition to ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'', to counter ''Cycling''{{'}}s perceived establishment views, which included not covering massed racing on the open road after the [[Second World War]] and giving what some readers saw as little attention to professional cycling, such as the [[Tour de France]]. ''Cycling'' was originally dismissive of a breakaway organisation, the [[British League of Racing Cyclists]] and campaigned against it and did little to cover its races; ''The Bicycle'' saw itself as neither for or against the BLRC but saw massed-start racing an exciting part of cycle-racing. ''The Bicycle'' appeared on Tuesday rather than the Friday of its rival.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bicycle'' was founded by Bill Mills who in 1933 had organised massed-start racing on the car track at Brooklands as a trial for the world championship road race. His co-organiser was Vic Jenner, who helped finance ''Sporting Cyclist''. It was the first mass race in Britain for 40 years. Mills was a talented rider, originally from Brighton, who briefly had a contract with the Oscar Egg team in Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadley translated reports in French and Belgian papers, and cuttings sent by the magazine's correspondent at [[L'Auto]] and cycled around the Continent reporting the races he saw and writing accounts of the riders he had met. Adrian Bell, the British publisher who compiled a collection of Wadley's work, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And so began a pattern of working life and, with it, a unique style of writing about cycling that Wadley was to maintain, to a greater or lesser extent, for more than 20 years. When not required for race-reporting duties in England, he would load the panniers of his bicycle – spare clothes and maps in one, a portable typewriter in the other – and take to the roads of France, Belgium Holland. Whatever the route, it was of his choosing. And back would come the reports – of major Tours, French classics, frenetic kermesses over the Belgian pavé, or six-day dramas on the steep banking of indoor [[velodrome]]s – or interviews with current riders or with those whose exploits had once made cycling history, or simply touring features that depicted the appealing variety of the terrain through which he travelled. During one two-month tour in the spring of 1954, he submitted 3,000 words a week; there was simply nothing like it in the English cycling press.&lt;ref name="Wadley"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wadley left the magazine two years later and joined the press department of the bicycle maker, [[Hercules]], which was sponsoring prominent British riders to break long-distance records. From there he was conscripted into the services at the start of the [[Second World War]].

With the return of peace, he became one of three press officers for the sport's governing body, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] when the [[Olympic Games]] were held in London in 1948. He then rejoined ''The Bicycle'' and stayed until it closed in 1955. That year he started work on a monthly magazine, initially called ''Coureur'' but then, because a magazine with a similar title already existed, ''[[Sporting Cyclist]]''.

==''Sporting Cyclist''==
Wadley recalled of his redundancy: "I saw more cycling... than in four far-from-dull years on ''The Bicycle''. As the programme included my first all-the-way Tour de France, I had enough material in hand to write a book... The dream, however, was to bring out a continental-style all-cycling magazine."&lt;ref name=Sporting&gt;''Sporting Cyclist'', vol 9, no 9, September 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1956, Wadley secured the backing of the publisher [[Charlie Buchan|Charles Buchan]], former [[association football|football]] captain of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[England national football team|England]], who wanted a companion to his magazine, ''Football Monthly''. Wadley told Buchan that he had a proposal which would never make him rich but wouldn't disgrace him, an approach so novel that Buchan was interested from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Private letter, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Issue number one was written by Wadley, who had also taken most of the photographs.&lt;ref name="Wadley"&gt;Bell, Adrian (ed.) (2002) ''From the Pen of J. B. Wadley'', Mousehold Press, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced at the home of Peter Bryan, Wadley's editor at ''The Bicycle'',&lt;ref&gt;The two met when Bryan, then still at school, was evacuated to Colchester at the start of the war. Bryan joined a ride that went too fast for him and Wadley took pity on him and bought him his afternoon tea.&lt;/ref&gt; with help from a photographer, Bill Lovelace, and a designer, Glenn Steward. They too had worked at ''The Bicycle''.&lt;ref name="Wadley"/&gt;

''Sporting Cyclist'' introduced Continental racing through the Franco-American writer, [[René de Latour]]. His role was "friend of the stars", providing insights into Continental racing at a time when ''Cycling'' concentrated on domestic issues.

The cycle parts importer and advertiser, Ron Kitching, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This was a real innovation and an instant success. It was filled with exciting stories of both home and overseas events, written not only by Jock himself but also by the top cycling writers of the day – like René de Latour, Harry Aspden, Charles Ruys and Dick Snowden, Geoffrey Nicholson and David Saunders.&lt;ref name=Kitching&gt;''A wheel in two worlds'', written and published by Ron Kitching 1993, ed: Michael Breckon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Closure==

The last edition was in April 1968, volume 12, number 4. ''Sporting Cyclist'' was by then owned by Longacre Press, which had bought Buchan's publications. Longacre also published ''Cycling'' and the two merged. The assistant editor, Roy Green, who had joined in 1960, left ''Sporting Cyclist'' to join ''[[Amateur Photographer]]''.

Wadley set up another magazine, ''International Cycle Sport'', which after 199 issues in 17 years also failed, by which time Wadley's contract as editor had long since not been renewed.

==''International Cycle Sport''==

''International Cycle Sport'' was the idea of Kennedy Brothers, a printing company in [[Keighley]], Yorkshire owned by three brothers. It was the first English-language cycling magazine printed in colour, with a colour cover and several colour pages inside.&lt;ref name="Wadley"/&gt; The contents were those which would have appeared in the next ''Sporting Cyclist''. Wadley's assistant editor, John Wilcockson, said: "We were thrilled with the first issue that came off the presses, even though the colour reproduction was pretty awful."&lt;ref name="Wadley"/&gt; One of the pictures, of the Belgian rider [[Patrick Sercu]] was printed the wrong way round.

Wadley wrote in his first leading article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had launched [Sporting Cyclist] because I knew the cycling world wanted it. There was never any suggestion that it would make a lot of money for anybody. Yet within a few years, after a series of mergers and takeovers, ''Sporting Cyclist'' found itself under the control of a giant publishing organisation whose business, understandably, was to make money. A small monthly magazine supported by what it considered to be a "dying industry" was obviously of little interest to such a concern, and its eventual merger with ''Cycling'' was simply a matter of time. When the decision was taken I and my most able assistant Roy Green were given the chance of carrying on with the combined publication, but neither accepted the offer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalcyclesport.com/html/ics_magazine.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The magazine was produced in a basement office in [[Kingston upon Thames]] [[Surrey]], rented from Maurice Cumberworth, race director of the [[Milk Race]]. Kennedy Brothers, however, failed and a receiver passed its assets to another Yorkshire printer, Peter Fretwell. The magazine was among the assets. Fretwell's company was also struggling and the receiver hoped to make one strong company out of two weak ones.

Wilcockson said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Peter Fretwell was a tough-minded businessman, the antithesis of the mild-mannered Wadley. The two men didn't get on... The arrangement worked for a while, but Fretwell soon decided that he could do without Wadley. I was prepared to go too, but my 'father' [Wadley] said no... Well, within a year, I was fired too.&lt;ref name="Wadley"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adrian Bell wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So the saying goes, you can never walk the same road twice. ''ICS'' was not ''Sporting Cyclist'' in full-colour guise. In the first place it never had the same breadth of coverage. Secondly, not only was it more narrowly focused, it contained fewer articles, and they were mainly written by professional journalists. In its text and the use of full-page colour photography, it was closer to a contemporary monthly cycling journal; it was never a diary written by clubmen for clubmen.&lt;ref name="Wadley"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tour de France==
Jock Wadley covered 18 Tours de France not only for his magazine but for the London [[Daily Telegraph]]. The paper then decided to send its specialist cycling reporter, David Saunders. Until then Saunders had not wanted to spend a month of each summer away from home.

The new arrangement ended Wadley's newspaper career and halted the occasional contributions he made to BBC Radio, where he reported on noisy short-wave and telephone links from races such as the world championship and [[Bordeaux–Paris]], a race from which he reported the victory of the British rider, [[Tom Simpson]].

It also ended Wadley's habit of following the Tour in the car of French journalist colleagues and he covered his 19th Tour by bike and wrote a book called ''My Nineteenth Tour de France''.

His years at the Tour de France earned him the race's medal. He received it from the organisers [[Jacques Goddet]] and [[Félix Lévitan]] at [[Carpentras]] in 1970. For many years he had been the only permanent English-speaking reporter on the Tour and the race press officer, Louis Lapeyre, who for many years refused to speak to any anglophone journalists let alone do it in English, finally negotiated with them through Wadley.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Geoffrey (1991), Le Tour, Hodder and Stoughton, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tom Simpson==
Few cyclists featured in Wadley's writing as much as [[Tom Simpson]], the first Briton to wear the [[yellow jersey]] in the Tour de France. Wadley's first encounter with him was in 1955 while he was at a training camp in [[Monaco]] sponsored by the [[derailleur]]-maker, [[Simplex]]. The camp was run by the former Tour rider, [[Charles Pélissier]]. Wadley went there to report, specifically on a promising Irish rider called [[Seamus Elliott]], who had won his place as a prize in the previous year's Tour of Ireland.

Many cyclists unable to attend the camp wrote to Pélissier, asking his advice. Wadley translated them into French for him. One said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Sir, I am writing to you hoping you will give me some advice on racing and training for the 1955 season. I am 16 years old, and have raced on the track and also massed start road races, competing in between, in [[time trials]]. In my first track event I gained 3rd place, in road races I have won 2 prizes and in time trials I have won 4 prizes. My positions in time trials were 11th, 8th, 15th, 7th. I have done 25 miles in 1hr 34 seconds, which is the fastest time for a 16-year-old in England this year.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to know, if you think it is advisable to compete in so many different events, and also what greatest mileage I should race. I have been told that if I race often, I will burn myself out, and will be no good when I get older, do you think this is true. Yours in sport, Thomas Simpson, HARWORTH &amp; DIST. C.C.&lt;ref&gt;Private letter, 22 November 1954&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no evidence of a reply from Pélissier, who didn't speak English, although Wadley suggested in ''[[Sporting Cyclist]]'' in 1965 that he may have done.

==Writing style==
Martin Ayres, one of several who wrote their first articles for [[Sporting Cyclist]] and went on to edit cycling magazines of their own,&lt;ref&gt;Ayres became editor of ''Cycling'', as did Alan Gayfer; John Wilcockson became editor of ''Velonews'' in the USA&lt;/ref&gt; said that Wadley's discursive, first-person style looked simple but "I tried to copy Jock's style once or twice when I was editor of ''Cycling'', but when I did it, it just seemed like name-dropping.'

Adrian Bell wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This consistent use of the first person in his articles is crucial to understanding the appeal of his writing. Regardless of whether he was composing an account of a race, interviewing an old-time, retired cyclist, or describing a leisurely tour, he always used this technique. Events were not reported as if they were simple objective facts, nor were they sensationalised; always we saw them through his eyes and ears. He offered us his thoughts, his emotions and his immediate impressions at the moment of their happening, and if those impressions needed to be revised in the light of later revelations, he did that, too, and explained why... Good letter-writers, so they say, are basically good conversationalists and, by all accounts, J. B. Wadley was certainly that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Long-distance riding==
Wadley always rode in [[Hush Puppies|Hush Puppy]] shoes, which he said hurt his feet less than conventional cycling shoes. He rode long distances both in races such as 24-hour time-trials – he rode just short of 400 miles in the North Road event when he was 59 – and outside competition. His first book, ''My 19th Tour de France'', starts: "I had practised and thoroughly enjoyed what I had for so long been preaching. Instead of lazing 3,000 miles in a press car, I had pedalled 1,750 on a bike. Instead of scribbling 400 words a night and phoning them through to [[Fleet Street]], I have taken my time in writing 90,000 and sent them to the printers."&lt;ref&gt;Wadley, J. B. (1974), My 19th Tour de France, J. B. Wadley Publications, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

His fondness for France led him to join the Union Sportif at [[Créteil]], in the Paris suburbs. That led to his riding the 1,200&amp;nbsp;km challenge, [[Paris–Brest–Paris]], which he recorded in another book, ''Old Roads and New''. His writing inspired riders around the world. In Britain it led to the creation of [[Audax UK]] to provide a means for British riders to take part. In Canada said the long-distance enthusiast Eric Fergusson:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here in [[British Columbia]], "Brestward Ho!" [title of the chapter recounting Paris–Brest–Paris] did indeed make its mark. After reading the story, local cycling legend John Hathaway committed to ride the Audax version of PBP in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;There are two versions of the ride, held in different years ever since a political split decades ago. The Audax version is the smaller and less well known.&lt;/ref&gt; While in France, he met the randonneur PBP organiser Robert Lepertel and was persuaded to come back for the next randonneur PBP in 1979. Three years later Hathaway returned to France with fellow randonneur pioneers Dan McGuire, Gerry Pareja, and Wayne Phillips to participate in (and complete!) PBP '79 marking the birth of randonneur cycling in British Columbia, and indeed, in Canada.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was a celebration marking the 25th anniversary of BC Randonneurs at the club's annual general meeting in September 2003. At this event Gerry Pareja... held up a copy of ''Old Roads and New''. With the "Brestward Ho!" chapter in mind Gerry suggested that: 'This book probably had more to do with getting English-speaking cyclists to become interested in PBP than anything else written about it.' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.randonneurs.bc.ca/pbp/stories/brestward-ho/introduction.html, retrieved September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadley rode the Brevet des Randonneurs des Alpes, a mountain challenge, in 1973. It was run as a time-trial over the col de Glandon, the Croix de Fer, the [[Telegraphe]] and the [[Col du Galibier|Galibier]]. The race started in [[Grenoble]] at 2&amp;nbsp;am. Wadley had hoped to meet [[Pierre Brambilla]], who lost the Tour de France on the last day in 1947. He was attacked, against a tradition that the race leader would be left to ride to Paris in glory, by the Frenchman [[Jean Robic]]. Wadley had met Brambilla but never remembered to ask the truth of the story that he was so upset by his defeat that he buried his bike in his garden.

Graeme Fife wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Brambilla caught Wadley on the approach to the Galibier. Wadley thought the Italian veteran (now 53 years old) would have been miles ahead, but he'd overslept and set out an hour late. He offered to give Wadley a tow up the Galibier; Wadley declined and Brambilla flew off. Wadley remembered the buried bicycle story and called out, but too late... the chance to confirm or scotch missed." &lt;ref&gt;Fife, Graeme (1999), Tour de France, Mainstream Publishing, UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
Wadley remained disillusioned at the closure of ''Sporting Cyclist'' – "the only time I saw him angry", said Peter Bryan – and at being fired from ''International Cycle Sport'' and at the mixed success of his book-publishing venture. He died in March 1981 and his ashes were scattered on the [[col du Glandon]] in the [[Alps]]. His widow, Mary, had asked that his ashes be scattered on the route of the Tour.

They were taken by a group of readers led by the British enthusiast, Neville Chanin. They scattered them on [[Bastille Day]] during the Tour de France. Chanin wrote:

:We dined well that night [before the scattering of ashes] but then we usually do. This meal was a special one: our table was laid for eight, yet fellow diners noted only seven lads present. They watched in silence as we drank a toast to the unoccupied chair at the head of our table... It seemed logical and fitting that Jock should attend his final Tour with a bunch of British clubmen... We – the seven of us – had each taken a turn in carrying the remains of our Sporting Cyclist over the mountain roads he knew so well and now Chris would carry him up the Glandon – two hours of real climbing.

:I'd chosen a special spot on the Glandon because, in 1973 on his 59th birthday, Jock had climbed that pass while riding the Brevet Randonneur des Alpes. Dave was first to the summit and had descended the 13km to locate the spot in the Défilé de Maupas where the Torrent des Sept Laux comes crashing down from seven lakes higher up the mountain, forming a spectacular waterfall. He had already gathered a selection of mountain flowers and arranged them in a plastic bottle and was making a simple cross as I arrived... Our intentions had been announced on [[Radio Tour]] and the organisers had positioned a [[Gendarmerie|gendarme]] nearby to ensure that our scattering of his ashes was not interrupted. It was sad and silent.&lt;ref&gt;Chanin, Neville, Bicycle Times, UK, cited From the Pen of J. B. Wadley, ed Adrian Bell, Mousehold Press, Norwich, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Bryan said: "Wadley's beautiful turn of phrase could be applied equally to a touring theme or race report, and he carried you, the reader, along with him as though you were riding and hearing his words borne from the front saddle."&lt;ref name="Wadley"/&gt;

Ron Kitching said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He wasn't ruthless enough to be a businessman, he just floated through life absorbing the cycling scene and reflecting it in his articles and books. I don't think Jock ever worked as such, he just put down in words what his thoughts were. Jock was a real gentleman but he did tend to wander off. We were sponsoring the Tour of the North and ''International Cycle Sport'' was one of the sponsors. He turned up on his bike, just pottering about. He seemed more interested in riding his bike than covering the race. Which was his downfall, really.&lt;ref name=Kitching/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An annual road race is held near Colchester each summer in Wadley's memory. Wadley had been president of the Colchester Rovers. A collection of his writing was published in 2002: ''From the pen of J. B. Wadley'', ed: Adrian Bell, Mousehold Press, Norwich.

The '''Johnny Mannah Cup''' is a trophy contested annually in a game between the [[National Rugby League]]'s [[Parramatta Eels]] and [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]] clubs. It was introduced to commemorate [[Johnny Mannah]] following his death in January 2013 from [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].

The game featured No. 1-ranked and two-time defending national champion [[2013 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]] (11–0, 7–0 in the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]]) as a 10-point favorite over the No. 4-ranked [[2013 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Tigers]] (10–1, 6–1 in the SEC). The Iron Bowl was fiercely contested in 2013 with both teams ranked in the top 5 and a berth in the [[2013 SEC Championship Game]] and, potentially, the national championship game at stake.&lt;ref name="Alabama-Auburn 2013 game box score on ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anniston Star Marq Burnett" /&gt; However, this game was particularly notable for its ending.&lt;ref name="Lightning striking twice"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2013/11/30/west-college-football-auburn-tigers-alabama-crimson-tide-iron-bowl/3791245/|title=No. 5 Auburn shocks No. 1 Alabama on game's final play|work=USA Today|first=Dan|last=Wolken|date=November 30, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC Sports article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/11/30/auburn-returns-field-goal-for-sec-west-clinching-td-hands-alabama-first-loss/|title=Auburn returns field goal for SEC West clinching TD, hands Alabama first loss|work=NBC Sports|first=Kevin|last=McGuire|date=November 30, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After falling behind in the 2nd quarter and then again in the 4th, Auburn rallied late to tie the game at 28–28 with 32 seconds remaining.&lt;ref name="Alabama-Auburn 2013 game box score on ESPN"/&gt; After the ensuing kickoff, Alabama quickly moved to the Auburn 38 yard line, at which point the clock ran out, seemingly sending the game to overtime. Alabama coach [[Nick Saban]] challenged the timekeeping call, and after a video review, one second was put back on the clock, and the Crimson Tide lined up for a potential game winning 57-yard field goal. The kick was short, and Auburn's [[Chris Davis (cornerback)|Chris Davis]], who had been positioned near the goal line, caught the ball just in front of the goal posts. Davis ran across the entire field through players from both teams to the opposite end zone, improbably scoring the winning touchdown for Auburn on the last play of the game. Though the runback was technically about 109 yards, it is officially considered a 100 yard return according to NCAA rules, and it tied [[LSU Tigers football|LSU's]] [[Odell Beckham Jr.]]'s record-setting 100 yard return that same season.&lt;ref name="Alabama-Auburn 2013 game box score on ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Odell Beckham return"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/23532853/video-odell-beckham-returns-missed-fg-109-yards-for-td|title=Odell Beckham returns missed FG 109 yards for TD|work=CBS Sports|first=Jerry|last=Hinnen|date=September 7, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richie Luzzi return"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/25390/yards-to-glory-sec-version|title=Yards to Glory, SEC version|work=ESPN|first=Chris|last=Low|date=August 1, 2011|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Don Guest return"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebiglead.com/2013/09/07/odell-beckham-returned-a-missed-field-goal-100-yards-for-a-touchdown/|title=Odell Beckham Returned a Missed Field Goal 100 Yards for a Touchdown|work=The Big Lead|first=Michael|last=Shamburger|date=September 7, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Missed Field Goals returned for touchdowns"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/no-4-auburn-beats-no-032646253--ncaaf.html|title=No. 4 Auburn beats No. 1 Alabama on rare play|work=Associated Press|publisher=Yahoo|date=November 30, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jordan-Hare Stadium south.jpg|thumb|[[Jordan–Hare Stadium]], where the 78th Iron Bowl was played]]
The two teams came into the game after very different 2012 seasons. Despite an upset at the hands of Texas A&amp;M, the [[2012 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Crimson Tide]] ultimately finished as SEC Champions after [[2012 SEC Championship Game|a close game]] against the [[2012 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]] and went on to soundly defeat Notre Dame 42–14 for their second consecutive national title, their third in four years. Meanwhile, two years after their own National Championship, the Auburn Tigers suffered through their worst season in 60 years, finishing 3–9 with an abysmal 0–8 SEC record, capped by a 49–0 loss to Alabama in the 2012 Iron Bowl–their second consecutive blowout loss on the Iron Bowl. Head coach [[Gene Chizik]] was fired in favor of Arkansas State coach [[Gus Malzahn]].

Alabama entered the season ranked #1 and remained at the top of the polls for the entire season, rolling through their schedule with relative ease; they won all but one of their games by more than 10 points. Auburn, on the other hand, entered the season unranked and didn't enter the AP Poll until the midpoint of the season. Auburn's season was defined by a series of come-from-behind wins and miraculous plays. Auburn defeated [[2013 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]] in September on a late touchdown pass.&lt;ref name="Auburn vs. Mississippi State"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeandmagnolia.com/football/2013/9/15/4732146/auburn-mississippi-state-highlights-nick-marshall-cj-uzomah|title=Auburn 24, Mississippi State 20: Highlights of the Tigers'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, No. 24 Auburn came from behind to beat No. 7 [[2013 Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team|Texas A&amp;M]] and [[Johnny Manziel]].&lt;ref name=" Auburn-Texas A&amp;M 2013 game box score on ESPN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=332920245&amp;period=4|title= Auburn vs. Texas A&amp;M (Oct 19, 2013) Box Score|work=ESPN|date=October 19, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With that win, Auburn surged all the way to No. 11 in both major polls. 

Two weeks before the Iron Bowl, No. 7 Auburn defeated [[Deep South's Oldest Rivalry|rival]] [[2013 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]] with a miraculous tipped [[Hail Mary pass]] known as the "[[Prayer at Jordan–Hare]].",&lt;ref name="Lightning striking twice"/&gt; setting the stage for a highly ranked Iron Bowl matchup.

===Second quarter===
Alabama scored touchdowns on their first three possessions of the second quarter, with the first two on scoring passes by [[AJ McCarron]]; the first was a 67-yard drive,&lt;ref name="Alabama-Auburn 2013 game box score on ESPN"/&gt; the second was 36 yards,&lt;ref name="Alabama-Auburn 2013 game box score on ESPN"/&gt; and the third drive covered 56 yards. Alabama had scored 21 unanswered points.&lt;ref name="Alabama-Auburn 2013 game box score on ESPN"/&gt; But Auburn scored late in the second quarter on a [[Tre Mason]] run,&lt;ref name="Alabama-Auburn 2013 game box score on ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alabama-Auburn 2013 game box score on ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times article"/&gt; and the Crimson Tide led, 21–14, at the half.&lt;ref name="Alabama-Auburn 2013 game box score on ESPN"/&gt;

===Third quarter===

[[Yahoo! Sports]] columnist [[Pat Forde]] stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;It was, quite simply, the most astounding ending ever to a college football game.

===Naming the game===
After the game, the press identified Alabama's [[Achilles' heel]]: the kicking game. In reference to their four unsuccessful field goal attempts, writers called the game "Kick Bama Kick," in reference to the 1972 Iron Bowl, nicknamed "[[Punt Bama Punt]]".&lt;ref name="Kick Bama Kick by Ryan Black"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/2013/11/30/2830054/alabama-leads-iron-bowl-at-halftime.html|title=Kick, Bama, kick: Auburn stuns Alabama to win Iron Bowl|work=Ledger-Enquirer|first=Ryan|last=Black |date=November 30, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 6:43&amp;nbsp;p.m., just 18 minutes after of the conclusion of the game, Jon Solomon of ''[[The Birmingham News]]'' posted an article titled "Kick Bama Kick", but included an [[online poll]] allowing readers to select their favorite moniker.&lt;ref name="Kick Bama Kick by Jon Solomon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2013/11/kick_bama_kick_name_chris_davi.html|title=Kick Bama Kick: Name Chris Davis' stunning Iron Bowl touchdown|first=Jon|last=Solomon |work=The Birmingham News|date=November 30, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among seven proposed titles, "Kick Bama Kick" won by a landslide. Ryan Black of the ''[[Ledger–Enquirer]]'' in [[Columbus, Georgia]] titled an article "Kick, Bama, kick" within hours of the game's completion.&lt;ref name="Kick Bama Kick by Ryan Black"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Missed Field Goals returned for touchdowns"/&gt; Frank Cooney of [[Yahoo! Sports]], who noted that the game will be "forever secured" in the discussion for the most dramatic college football game in history, also titled his piece "Kick Bama Kick" that evening.&lt;ref name="Kick Bama Kick by Frank Cooney"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/iron-bowls-name-game-kick-035213596--ncaaf.html|title=Iron Bowl's name game: Kick Bama Kick!|publisher=Yahoo! Sports|first=Frank|last=Cooney|date=November 30, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year after the game, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', [[CBS Sports]] and [[Fox Sports]] referred to it as the "Kick Six".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/11/24/iron-bowl-alabama-auburn-one-year-later The other side of a miracle: Looking back at historic Iron Bowl a year later], ''Sports Illustrated''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/feature/24839803/remembering-kick-six Remembering "Kick Six"], CBS Sports&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/alabama-auburn-iron-bowl-score-recap-crimson-tide-tigers-kick-six-112914 No. 1 Alabama avenges 'Kick Six,' beats No. 15 Auburn in Iron Bowl], Fox Sports&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Kick Six" is also used, in general, to refer to other instances of blocked or missed field goals being returned for a touchdown, such as one occurring in an [[NFL]] game on November 30, 2015, as performed by the [[Baltimore Ravens]] against the [[Cleveland Browns]].&lt;ref name=espn-nflkicksix&gt;{{cite news|title=Five things on the 'Kick Six' that led to Browns' latest defeat|url=https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/11/30/9825230/ravens-browns-kick-six-will-hill-monday-night-football|accessdate=13 January 2016|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is a play on the term "pick six", which refers to an interception being returned for a touchdown.

==Nominations and awards==
At the [[2014 ESPY Awards]], recognizing the greatest achievements in 2013, the 2013 Iron Bowl won the award for "Best Game". The other two nominees were Game Five of the [[2014 Stanley Cup Finals]] and the [[2013–14 NFL playoffs#Wild Card Playoffs|Indianapolis Colts first round playoff victory]].&lt;ref name="2014 ESPY Nominees"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/803724-espy-awards-2014-nominees-list-winners-predictions-vote-info-presenters-host/ |title=ESPY Awards 2014: Nominees List, Winners Predictions, Vote Info, Presenters, Host |work=Epoch Times |first=Zachary |last=Stieber |date=July 16, 2014 |accessdate=July 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725133655/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/803724-espy-awards-2014-nominees-list-winners-predictions-vote-info-presenters-host/ |archivedate=July 25, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2014 ESPY Winners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/espy-awards-2014-winners-and-top-moments/ |title=ESPY Awards 2014 winners and top moments |work=CBSNews |first=Lauren |last=Moraski |date=July 17, 2014 |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game-winning touchdown return was named "Best Play" at the 2014 ESPYs. The play beat three other nominees including the play near the end of Auburn's [[Prayer at Jordan–Hare|game against Georgia]].&lt;ref name="2014 ESPY Nominees"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2014 ESPY Winners"/&gt;

==Oddities==
The crowd reaction to the game's final play registered on seismographs across the state of Alabama in a manner similar to activity registered during the 1988 Auburn–LSU "[[Earthquake Game]]".&lt;ref name="Iron Bowl Earthquake"/&gt;

Cremated human remains were discovered on the field inside Jordan–Hare Stadium by Auburn's grounds crew the Monday following the game, presumably left by a [[pitch invasion|field-rusher]] who was honoring a request from a deceased relative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2013/12/cremated-human-remains-ashes-dumped-on-pat-dye-field-at-jordan-hare-stadium/#.VC3V9hb9nfM Cremated remains dumped on Pat Dye Field at Jordan–Hare Stadium after the Iron Bowl.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lewisohn Stadium''' was an amphitheater and athletic facility built on the campus of the [[City College of New York]]. It opened in 1915 and was demolished in 1973.

==History==
The Doric-colonnaded amphitheater was built between [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam]] and Convent Avenues, from 136th to 138th Streets, in 1915, with a capacity of 8,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Automobile Blue Book]], [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/manhattan_upper_1920.jpg Chief Points of Interest in Upper Manhattan], 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  Financier and philanthropist [[Adolph Lewisohn]] donated the money for construction. The stadium hosted many athletic, musical, and theatrical events and was one of New York's public landmarks. It was demolished in 1973 to make way for the $125 million North Academic Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Carter B.|last= Horsley|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Lewisohn Stadium, Center for Culture, to Be Razed |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/05/archives/lewisohn-stadium-center-for-culture-to-be-razed-a-zlike-structure.html |quote=A $90-million academic center is planned to replace Lewisohn Stadium-the amphitheater and athletic field of City College that served as the city's summer cultural center for about half a century. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=April 5, 1973 |accessdate=2008-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The CCNY football team played its home games at Lewisohn from 1921 to 1950; the final game played was a 33–6 Beavers victory over [[Lowell Technological Institute|Lowell Textile]] on November 18, 1950, in front of 300 fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luckyshow.org/football/beavers.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; (It was CCNY's only win that season, and the program was discontinued the following year.)

==Classical concerts==
Besides sporting events, the stadium was used for performances by [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Louis Armstrong]], the [[Metropolitan Opera]], the [[New York Philharmonic]] (sometimes called the "Stadium Symphony Orchestra"), Renata Tebaldi [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Marian Anderson]], [[Alfredo Antonini]] &lt;ref&gt; Stern, Jonathan. ''Music for the (American) People: The Concerts at Lewisohn Stadium, 1922-1964'', The City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center, New York 2009, P. 204-205 [https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=3282&amp;context=gc_etds Alfredo Antonini conductor at Lewisohn Stadium on academicworks.cuny.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eugene Ormandy]]. [[Leopold Stokowski]] made a series of recordings for [[Everest Records|Everest]] with the "Stadium Symphony Orchestra of New York." [[George Gershwin]] played his ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]''. Performers ranged from [[Van Cliburn]], [[Jascha Heifetz]], and [[Yehudi Menuhin]] to [[Leontyne Price]], [[Roberta Peters]], [[Licia Albanese]] &lt;ref&gt; ''Stadium Concerts Review'' - Stadium Symphony Orchestra,  Herald Square Press, Volume XLII, No. 1, 22 June 1959, P. 17 [http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/64e03b3b-6294-4ff8-8e54-86245693a4ec-0.1/fullview#page/1/mode/2up ''Stadium Concerts Review'' program listing for Licia Albanese, Alfredo Antonini, Richard Tucker and The New York Philharmonic on 25 June 1959 p. 17 on nyphil.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Peerce]], [[Richard Tucker]], [[Placido Domingo]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Thomas Hayward (tenor)]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Benny Goodman]], &lt;ref&gt; Stern, Jonathan.

Due to declining attendances, the concerts were discontinued in 1966.

==Other uses==
The stadium was used by City College for its commencement exercises; all CCNY campuses took part, including Liberal Arts, Engineering and Architecture, and its Manhattan Business School (now [[Baruch College]]); this continued through June1973. It was also used for CCNY's annual Army [[ROTC]]'s reviews at the end of each academic year. Along with [[Jasper Oval]] (right across Convent Avenue, also now demolished), Lewisohn was used throughout the academic year for many of the college's uptown campus outdoor intramural sports.

==In film==
The derelict stadium was used in the 1973 film ''[[Serpico]]'', directed by [[Sidney Lumet]], in a scene with [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]] and [[Al Pacino]]. It also appeared as the setting of the final scene of the 1945 film ''[[Rhapsody in Blue (film)|Rhapsody in Blue]]'' in which [[Oscar Levant]] performs the title composition, with an orchestra conducted by [[Paul Whiteman]], as a memorial to the composer.

{{For|the exhibition grounds formerly known as Northlands Park|Northlands}}
'''Northlands Park''' is the "Alberta A circuit" [[horse racing]] track at [[Northlands]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]. The horse racing season generally consists of a spring harness ([[Standardbred]]) meet from February/March, a [[Thoroughbred]] meet from May/June to September/October and a fall harness meet to mid-December. Northlands Park (formerly Northlands Spectrum) is the building name for the grandstand. There are three dining areas on the second floor. Colours is the main dining room overlooking the race track and has a [[seating capacity]] of 700. Uplinks Theatre is the simulcast restaurant area and features 6 projection televisions and up to 26 different simulcast race broadcasts from North American tracks and Sha Tin in Hong Kong. Playbook Lounge is open limited hours and is available for private functions, sports broadcast events (27 televisions) and private parties. There are two other concessions on the second floor - Rock's and The Deli - that are open during live horse racing.

The track opened in 1900 to replace [[Rossdale Flats]] with upgrades in 1995 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmontonplus.ca/edmonton/venues/northlands-spectrum/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slots at Northlands Park is the main-floor slot machine gaming room and features Las Vegas-style slot machines and [[Video lottery terminal|VLT]]s and has two dining areas - the Slot Lounge and the Slot Grill.  

The Paddock Theatre hosts the post position draw for the [[Canadian Derby]], Northlands Park's largest and most prestigious annual thoroughbred race. Directly outside of the Paddock Theatre is the outdoor paddock area - featuring a [[barbecue]] concession window with beer service, paddock viewing terrace and the race commentary television broadcast room.

Northlands Park was also the corporate operating name for Edmonton Northlands. The name was adopted from the race track name in 1995 and changed to [[Northlands]] in 2006. 

== Future ==
On February 18, 2016, Northlands announced that at the end of the 2016 season, the Park would be shut down as part of its Vision 2020 renovation plan, which proposed that the site be redeveloped as outdoor festival grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/business/local-business/dan-barnes-northlands-isnt-horsing-around-anymore-vision-2020-plan-is-about-evolution|title=Dan Barnes: Northlands isn't horsing around anymore; Vision 2020 plan is about evolution|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|date=February 18, 2016|accessdate=February 22, 2016|last=Barnes|first=Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Northlands president Tim Reid later announced in August that these plans were subject to discussions with the city, and that "we have made it clear that our plans are not to continue racing at this site. But we've also got to listen to our stakeholders — the owners, trainers and jockeys — and be considerate of their industry." Horse Racing Alberta issued a call for bids to construct a new A-level complex in the city, which was won by [[Century Casinos]]. It is expected that Northlands Park will continue to operate until the completion of the new Century Mile facility, which will be located near [[Edmonton International Airport]]. The venue was expected to be completed in July 2018 in time to host the Canadian Derby, but has since been delayed to later in the year. The 2017 edition of the race was advertised as being the final Canadian Derby at Northlands, but with the opening of the new track delayed until spring 2019, the 2018 edition will be hosted at Northlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/century-mile-horsing-racing-track-edmonton-approved-1.4042689|title=Century Mile horse racing track near Edmonton airport gets AGLC approval|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/thoroughbred-racing-edmonton-century-mile-northlands-tim-reid-1.4250270|title=Canadian Derby thoroughbred race location still uncertain for 2018|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/sports/door-not-shut-on-horse-racing-at-northlands-next-year|title=Door not shut on horse racing at Northlands next year|date=2016-08-17|work=Edmonton Journal|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4186028/horse-racing-northlands-alberta-edmonton/|title=New track delayed; horse racing to stay at Northlands a little longer|work=Global News|date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Riverside Stadium''' is a football stadium in [[Middlesbrough]], [[England]], which has been the home of [[Middlesbrough F.C.]] since it opened in 1995. Its current capacity is 34,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/riverside-stadiums-new-capacity-confirmed-13298568|title=Riverside Stadium's new capacity confirmed after Boro's relegation to Championship|last=Brown|first=Mike|date=8 July 2017|access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; all seated, although there is provisional planning permission in place to expand that to 42,000 if required.&lt;ref name="StadiumInfoGazette"/&gt;

==History==
The stadium was built to replace [[Ayresome Park]] after the [[Taylor Report]], which required all top division football stadiums to be all-seater. After the report was delivered in January 1990, Middlesbrough needed an all-seater stadium by August 1994, and were unable to expand Ayresome Park outwards owing to its location in a residential area, and expanding the stadium upwards would have limited the club to a capacity of around 20,000 seats – the club wanted a considerably larger capacity. The decision was taken by club officials to build a new stadium; [[Teesside Development Corporation]] offered them the Middlehaven site by the [[River Tees]] for development.

The new 30,000 seater stadium was constructed by [[Taylor Woodrow|Taylor Woodrow Construction]]&lt;ref name="StadiumInfo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/club/stadium-story/0,,1~2321257,00.html | title=The Riverside Stadium Info | work=MFC.co.uk | publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. | accessdate=9 April 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226012458/http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/club/stadium-story/0,,1~2321257,00.html | archivedate=26 February 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for £16&amp;nbsp;million, taking approximately nine months to complete after work began in the autumn of 1994.  The name of the stadium was chosen by the club's fans, following a vote during the final game at Ayresome Park.  The other choices available were ''Middlehaven Stadium'', ''Erimus Stadium'' and ''Teesside Stadium''.  When first opened, the name was amended to Cellnet Riverside Stadium (and then BT Cellnet Riverside Stadium) as part of a £3&amp;nbsp;million sponsorship deal with [[Cellnet]], but this deal ended after the 2001–02 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/borofc/clubinfo/ Boro FC club info, The Riverside Stadium – Gazette Live&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first game was played against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in front of a 28,286 crowd (the highest home attendance in 14 years) on 26 August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/GreatMatchesDetail/0,,1~536230,00.html Boro 2 Chelsea 0, 26 August 1995 | Middlesbrough | History | Great Games |Great Games&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908081630/http://www.mfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/GreatMatchesDetail/0,,1~536230,00.html |date=8 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Middlesbrough won the game 2–0, with [[Craig Hignett]] taking the honour of scoring the first ever goal at the stadium, [[Jan Åge Fjørtoft]] scoring the second. Their first season at their new stadium was also their first back in the [[FA Premier League]] following promotion after two seasons away.

In their second season at the Riverside Stadium, Middlesbrough were runners-up in both of the domestic cups but a points deduction in the league meant that they were relegated from the Premier League.

In 1998 – when Middlesbrough were promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt – the capacity was increased by 5,000 by filling in the north and south-west corners at a cost of £5 million. This expansion gave the stadium a 35,100 capacity.  Modernisation of the stadium since then has led to the seating being reorganised on several occasions with the stadium currently having a capacity of 34,000 (2017-18 season).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/riverside-stadiums-new-capacity-confirmed-13298568 |title=Riverside Stadium's new capacity confirmed after Boro's relegation to Championship |publisher=Gazette Live Website |date=8 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club have the Council's permission to extend the stadium by another 7,000 if demand made it necessary, which would bring its capacity up to approximately 42,000.

[[File:Borobrick War Heroes.JPG|thumb|right|200px|War heroes in the Borobrick Road]]
In 2005 the club resurrected the old Ayresome Park gates which had been famously locked when the club went into liquidation. They were erected outside the Riverside Stadium as a reminder of the past.  Another addition has been statues of former players, [[George Hardwick]] and [[Wilf Mannion]].  In front of the old Ayresome park gates is the location for the "Borobrick Road", where fans can pay to have a message inscribed on a brick (often in memory of a deceased family member) to be added to the road.  For [[Armistice Day]] 2008, a set of bricks commemorating 8 players who died in the World Wars was unveiled.&lt;ref name=Heroes&gt;[http://www.mfc.co.uk/articles/20081111/boro-remember-fallen-heroes_86418_1450618 www.mfc.co.uk] Boro remember fallen heroes&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, planning permission was granted by Middlesbrough Council to construct a [[wind turbine]] at the site of the stadium, standing 125 metres high and capable of generating 3 Megawatts of electricity. The turbine will be used to power the stadium, with the excess being sold to the [[National Grid plc|National Grid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/2008/07/08/boro-wind-turbine-given-go-ahead-84229-21301885/ |title=Boro wind turbine given go ahead |publisher=Evening Gazette |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2013, it was announced that [[Conference National]] side [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]] would stage a "home" game at the Riverside Stadium, after continual drainage problems at [[Gateshead International Stadium]] caused them to play their last 12 league games of the season at five different venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gateshead-fc.com/4428/ebbsfleet-game-at-boro |title=Ebbsfleet Game at Boro |publisher=Gateshead FC |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319131814/http://www.gateshead-fc.com/4428/ebbsfleet-game-at-boro |archivedate=19 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gateshead-fc.com/4396/hyde-game-at-croft-park |title=Hyde Game at Croft Park |publisher=Gateshead FC |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302232920/http://www.gateshead-fc.com/4396/hyde-game-at-croft-park |archivedate=2 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gateshead-fc.com/4374/media-watch-gateshead-look-at-alternatives |title=Media Watch – Gateshead look at alternatives |publisher=Gateshead FC |date=13 February 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623050244/http://www.gateshead-fc.com/4374/media-watch-gateshead-look-at-alternatives |archivedate=23 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the club's promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 2015/16 season, the ground underwent a £5m package of renovations designed to bring it up to the standards required of [[Premier League]] stadiums. Renovations included the installation of a large press box at the back of the East Stand, the construction of two permanent TV studios at the back of the South East Corner, with associated access and TV compound on the stadium's exterior, an internal reorganisation of the West Stand reception, tunnel and changing room area, new floodlights and refurbished concourse areas including the addition of new kiosks and card and contactless payment methods.

===International matches===
Like its predecessor [[Ayresome Park]], the Riverside Stadium has played host to international football. During the construction of the new [[Wembley Stadium]], the [[England national football team]] toured the country, playing at varying grounds. The Riverside was chosen to host the [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] qualifying match against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] on 11 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/england/2709253.stm |title=Riverside to host Slovakia clash |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=30 January 2003 |accessdate=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; England won the match 2–1 with a brace from [[Michael Owen]] after [[Vladimír Janočko]] had put Slovakia ahead. The match is also notable for pitting Middlesbrough's England defender [[Gareth Southgate]] against their own Slovakian striker at the time, [[Szilárd Németh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/2981828.stm |title=Clockwatch: Euro 2004 qualifiers |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team GB==
On 24 April 2012 it was announced that The Riverside Stadium would host the only public warm up match for [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Team GB]] before the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympic Games]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil Olympic Football Team]]. Football stars including [[Ryan Giggs]], [[Craig Bellamy]], [[Thiago Silva (footballer)|Thiago Silva]], [[Neymar]], [[Lucas Moura]], [[Hulk (footballer)|Hulk]] and even [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough's]] [[Jason Steele (footballer)|Jason Steele]] all featured in the match in which [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil Olympic Football Team]] outclassed [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Team GB]] winning 2–0 with 12 shots on target for Brazil compared to the 1 shot on target achieved by Team GB.

==Details==

===Stadium===
The stadium is fully enclosed with every seat offering an uninterrupted view of the pitch. The four main stands are commonly known as the North, East, West and South stands. The corners are referred to as the North-East, North-West, South-East and South-West corners. Concourses run around the entirety of the ground with kiosks serving food and drink.

The North stand backs on to the River Tees and at the back of the Stand is some of the vocal support is housed, and thus is also known as the New Holgate End in reference the Holgate End at [[Ayresome Park]], where the similar vocal supporters were located.

The West stand runs along the length of the pitch and is the stadium's largest stand. The stand contains a number of executive boxes along its length as well as restaurants etc. The stand houses the changing rooms, and the players tunnel emerges from the middle of the stand. White seating in the top tier spells out the club's nickname "BORO".

The East stand greets the players as they walk out the tunnel. The main television gantry was reallocated to the top of the stand from the west stand in 2016. White seating in the top tier of the stand spells out "MFC". The roof houses five flagpoles with various flags flying, usually representing the league and cup competitions the club are participating in, as well as a flag of the team crest. A new press box was installed at the back of this stand in preparation for the club's re-entry into the [[Premier League]]. The East stand houses a Family Zone (North east end) and also visiting supporters (South East Corner). Prior the 2016/17 season, two permanent television studios were installed at the back of the South East Corner, either side of the existing giant TV screen. One effect of this was a reduction in overall capacity.

The South stand has previously housed visiting supporters (now relocated to the East stand),  but since the 2013/14 season is currently (2017/18 season) occupied by home supporters. It includes most of the vocal support  is held, including Boro's own "Ultras" Group, the "Red Faction".

It has a capacity of 10,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadium-attendances.com/stade-albert-domec-carcassonne.htm|title=Stade Albert Domec Carcassonne|publisher=Stadium-attendances.com|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the home ground of [[Pro D2]] rugby union club [[US Carcassonne|Union Sportive Carcassonnaise]] and [[Elite One Championship]] rugby league club [[AS Carcassonne|Association Sportive de Carcassonne XIII]]. It is also used by the association football club Football Agglomération Carcassonne for their big matches. Built in 1899, it is one of the oldest stadiums in France, and was renovated in 2002, and again in 2012 when US Carcassonne entered the Pro D2. The stadium is named after the French rugby union player [[Albert Domec]], who died 20 September 1948, and who represented [[France national rugby union team|France]] in 1939. The stadium is also equipped for athletics and has an eight lane 400m track. 

The stadium has been used in [[Rugby League World Cup]]s. The ground has hosted many French rugby league championship and cup finals as well as French rugby league internationals, the first being in 1967 when [[Great Britain national rugby league team]] won 16-13 in front of 10,650 spectators

== History ==

Formerly called 'le stade de la Pepiniere' the ground was built and opened in 1899 and sits within the medieval castle walls of the city. In 1919 the rugby club paid 95,000 francs for the site then sold it to the local council a year later. The council built the two main stands that run along the length of the pitch each able to hold 3,000 spectators, floodlights and a cycle track were also installed. The stadium has been renovated twice since in 2002 and in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delaney|first1=Trevor|title=The International Grounds of Rugby League|date=1995|publisher=Trevor R Delaney|isbn=978-0950998244|pages=154, 155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground is named after the former [[US Carcassonne]] and French rugby union international player [[Albert Domec]] who played as a centre during the 1920s and 1930s. The stadium has a bronze statue of AS Carcassonne's most famous player, former captain of the [[France national rugby league team|French national rugby league team]], [[Puig Aubert]] at its entrance.The record attendance at the ground is 23,500 for the [[French rugby league championship]] Final in 1949 between [[AS Carcassonne]] and [[Marseille XIII]]

'''Taylor Field''' was an open-air [[stadium]] located in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]. It was the home field of the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] from its initial establishment as complete stadium in 1936 until 2016, although the team was playing some of its games at the site as early as 1921. Originally designed to house baseball as well as football, the stadium was converted to a football-only facility in 1966.

Taylor Field was also the home field for the [[University of Regina]] Rams, who play in [[U Sports]]' [[Canada West Universities Athletic Association|Canada West conference]], the [[Regina Thunder]], who play in the [[Canadian Junior Football League]]; and the Regina Riot of the Western Women's Canadian Football League. The field was also used to play high school football. It was owned and managed by the city of Regina. The field featured [[artificial turf]] and, as of [[2012 CFL season|2012]], a [[seating capacity]] of 32,848.&lt;ref name="4 new things about Mosaic Stadium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/story/2012/06/20/sk-mosaic-stadium-changes-120620.html|title=4 new things about Mosaic Stadium - CBC News|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium closed after the 2016 season, being succeeded by the new [[Mosaic Stadium]] at [[Evraz Place]], which was completed in 2016 and became the Roughriders' home field beginning in the [[2017 CFL season]]. Demolition of the stadium commenced in September 2017 and was completed on October 27, 2017. The site will be converted into a [[mixed use development]].

==History==
The stadium was located in the [[Neighbourhoods in Regina, Saskatchewan#North Central|North Central]] portion of Regina. Beginning in 1910, the original Regina Rugby Club played at various venues throughout the city, including Dominion Park and Exhibition Park. In 1921, the team began playing at a [[association football|soccer]] field known as Park Hughes.

In 1928, Park Hughes and an adjoining [[baseball]] diamond known as Park de Young were reconfigured to provide a better venue to accommodate the growing number of baseball and football fans. To make the facility suitable for both sports, the football field was laid out in a unique diagonal pattern, a configuration which would persist throughout the remainder of the facility's existence.

Nevertheless, the venue's facilities remained rudimentary even by contemporary standards. The playing surface was little more than plain dirt. When heavy rain turned the field to mud, the team was compelled to relocate games to other venues in the city, including the RCMP barracks. At the time, the barracks housed a unit informally called the ''Roughriders'' who were tasked with breaking in wild broncos for the force. In 1924, the Regina Rugby Club would adopt the ''Roughriders'' nickname as their own.

After the first permanent grandstand was built in 1936, the team moved into the facility full-time and remain there for the next eight decades. However, for a decade after the first permanent seating was built, the playing surface remained dirt, with a new layer of topsoil added every year. Late-season games were frequently played in dust bowl conditions. Finally, in 1946, the city recreation board agreed to plant a more stable grass surface.

In 1947 the facility was renamed Taylor Field after recently deceased [[Piffles Taylor|Neil J. "Piffles" Taylor]], a First World War fighter pilot and postwar lawyer who played and coached [[rugby union]] and football in the city, and subsequently served as president of the Regina Roughriders, the Canadian Rugby Union and the Western Interprovincial Football Union. A man of legendary toughness, Taylor lost an eye in action during the First World War, and spent more than a year in a German [[prisoner of war camp]], but persisted in playing football in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="newold"&gt;{{cite news|title=A new, old name|work=The Leader-Post|date=2006-06-23|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=1a1dad38-76f8-4ac2-8dff-4f9abf6f1a2d&amp;k=69100|accessdate=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His artificial glass eye was once jolted out of its socket when he was tackled. All play stopped while players from both teams hunted for the missing eye. When found, Taylor cleaned it, then popped it back into its socket and resumed play.&lt;ref name="familyok"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vanstone|first=Rob|title=Family was OK with stadium name|work=The Leader-Post|date=2006-06-24|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/sports/story.html?id=0731d613-4005-4c2f-bd73-54a3d8b61539|accessdate=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Rider receiver Hugh Campbell said in the documentary ''CFL Traditions'' in 2003. "When I first saw the stadium in Regina (in 1963), it looked like a farmer had built it, you know, like they'd just added on a few pieces here and there and half of the dressing room was dirt floor, where us rookies got to be. But we had a hook for everybody to hang their clothes on so that was a pretty good deal."

Renovations in 1978-79 increased the seating capacity by about 7,000 seats with the addition of an upper-level grandstand on the west side of the stadium, in addition, the stadium gained an artificial turf surface which replaced the natural grass surface previously used. In 2005, a new scoreboard was installed, which included the stadium's first permanent giant replay screen.

In 2005, Mosaic Stadium gained refurbished washrooms, concessions and refurbished seats on the east side, a new sound system, and the new ''[[SaskTel]] MaxTron'' video board.&lt;ref name="football.ballparks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://football.ballparks.com/CFL/Saskatchewan/|title=Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field|first=BALLPARKS.com by Munsey and|last=Suppes|website=football.ballparks.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a VIP deck and stands were put in place in the south endzone, allowing the football club to host its corporate game day sponsors.&lt;ref name="football.ballparks.com"/&gt; In 2007, the field was switched to the next-generation [[FieldTurf]]{{emdash}}Mosaic was the last stadium in the CFL to still use the old-style [[AstroTurf]].

On June 23, 2006, the Roughriders and [[The Mosaic Company]] announced a 10-year, $3.75 million [[naming rights]] deal. Unlike other similar deals, which have seen original names of facilities disappear, it was decided to retain the Taylor Field name, thus the facility was renamed '''Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field'''.&lt;ref name="newold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="familyok" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Rider partnership leads to new name|publisher=Saskatchewan Roughriders|url=http://www.saskriders.com/article/rider_partnership_leads_to_new_name|date=2006-06-23|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2008, the Roughriders announced that temporary seats would be added to the stadium due to high demand for tickets{{emdash}}the team had sold out every home game for the 2008 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Riders sell out entire season for first time in team history|work=Regina Leader-Post|date=2008-10-26|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/sports/story.html?id=bce4627d-ae95-40ca-9e87-185c8f9f0ba7|accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; With tickets in high demand coming off their Grey Cup season, an extra 2,145 seats were added, bringing the capacity to 30,945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roughriders add seats at Mosaic Stadium following string of sellouts|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=cdf23373-5309-4d7e-a941-06cfc68c6936|work=Regina Leader-Post|date=2008-07-31|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seating was first put to use during the Labour Day Classic against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Following the [[96th Grey Cup#West Semi-Final|2008 West Semi-Final]] game on November 8, 2008 against the [[BC Lions]], the temporary seats were taken down, putting the capacity back to the original number of 28,800. 2,145 temporary extra seats were put in place for [[2009 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2009 season]]. Temporary seating was again put in place for the [[2010 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2010 season]]; however, the additional seating only raised capacity to 30,048.&lt;ref name="capacity"&gt;https://leaderpost.com/sports/Riders+sales+still+amaze/4885366/story.html Riders' sales still amaze&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2012, the Roughriders announced a $14 million renovation plan known as the "Legacy Project" to prepare the stadium for hosting the [[101st Grey Cup]]. Riders chairman Roger Brandvold was quoted as saying "Replacing Mosaic Stadium still remains our top priority, but certain upgrades needed to be made to get us through the next few years and especially the 2013 Grey Cup". The first stage of the renovations were finished in time for the start of the 2012 season, with the addition of 7,000 extra seats and 27 new corporate suites (arranged to give the stadium a more "bowl"-like feel), additional bathrooms and concessions, the ''SaskTel MaxTron'' video screen and scoreboard upgraded to a 60-foot [[LED display|LED screen]] (with a second display directly alongside, shaped like the province of Saskatchewan), a new 55-foot video screen attached to the west grandstand, and ribbon screens along the bottom of the grandstands. For the 2013 season, its capacity was expanded to 45,000 with temporary seating, which were removed for the following season.&lt;ref name=newlook-mosaic&gt;{{cite web|title=New-look Mosaic Stadium set for debut|url=http://www.canada.com/sports/look+Mosaic+Stadium+debut/6824508/story.html|publisher=Leader-Post|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sask.

==Notable events==

===Football and other sports===
* Taylor Field was the venue for the [[83rd Grey Cup|83rd]], [[91st Grey Cup|91st]] and [[101st Grey Cup|101st]] [[Grey Cup]] games. A temporary grandstand seating for an additional 20,000-25,000 spectators was added for each of these games.
* It has also played host to the [[field hockey]] competition at the [[2005 Canada Games]] among other notable sporting events over the decades.
* The stadium was the site of the four longest field goals in CFL history (note that Taylor Field was one of the most windy venues in the CFL due to the windy Saskatchewan climate and the structure of the stadium itself). [[Dave Cutler]] kicked a then-league-record 59-yard field goal on October 28, 1970 (and narrowly missed a 71-yard attempt at the stadium in 1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luckyshow.org/football/field%20goals%20of%2060%20yards%20or%20more.htm|title=A List of All Players With Field Goals of 60 Yards Or More In the History of (American) Football|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul Watson tied that record with a 59-yarder against Winnipeg July 12, 1981. [[Dave Ridgway]] hit a 60-yarder against the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] September 6, 1987 (it was the first time in CFL history that a field goal was made from that distance). That record was broken by [[Paul McCallum (Canadian football)|Paul McCallum]], who kicked a 62-yard field goal against the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] on October 27, 2001 in a 12–3 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Riders proposed pay cut: B.C.-bound McCallum|publisher=CBC Sports|date=2006-02-23|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2006/02/22/mccallum_riders_confirmed060222.html?ref=rss|accessdate=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ridgway and [[Mark McLoughlin]] of the [[Calgary Stampeders]] have also kicked 58-yard field goals at Taylor Field.

In [[baseball]], the '''uniform number''' is a number worn on the uniform of each player and coach. Numbers are used for the purpose of easily identifying each person on the field as no two people from the same team can wear the same number. Although designed for identification purposes only, numbers have become the source of superstition, emotional attachment, and honor (in the form of a number retirement). The number is always on the back of the jersey, often on the front, and occasionally seen on the left leg of the pants.

==History==
[[File:José Méndez 1909.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[José Méndez]] of the [[Cuban Stars (West)|Cuban Stars]], seen with a uniform number on his left sleeve (1909).]]
Rumor has it that the uniform number first appeared in the 19th century, but the earliest official record is from 1907, when the [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading Red Roses]] of the [[Atlantic League (1896–1900)|Atlantic League]] numbered its players' jerseys in an effort to help the fans identify them. While it is unknown if the team ever took the field with numbers, it did mark the beginning of the idea of uniform numbers.&lt;ref name=numbers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/numbers.htm |title=National Baseball Hall of Fame – Dressed to the Nines – Parts of the Uniform |publisher=Exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniform number appeared on the jerseys of the [[Cuban Stars (West)|Cuban Stars]], a traveling team of the early 1900s, in 1909. In an issue of the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', star pitcher [[José Méndez]] is seen wearing the number 12 on his left sleeve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/timeline_1909b.htm |title=National Baseball Hall of Fame – Dressed to the Nines – Timeline |publisher=Exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time a Major League team wore numbers was on June 26, 1916. Inspired by football's and hockey's use of numbers, the [[Cleveland Indians]] trotted on their [[League Park|home field]] wearing large numbers on their left sleeves. This "experiment" was tried for a few weeks, again the next season, and then abandoned.&lt;ref name="numbers"/&gt;  In 1923, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] adopted uniform numbers on their sleeves. However, as then-manager [[Branch Rickey]] recalled, the Cardinals' players were "subjected to field criticism from the stands and especially from opposing players,"&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt; so the numbers were removed. At this time, the Indianapolis ABC's of the Negro National League and the San Antonio Bears of the Texas League also tried out numbers.

[[File:Jrobinson.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Jackie Robinson of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] wearing a uniform with a number on the front.]]
In 1929, the [[New York Yankees]] were planning to start the season with uniform numbers on the back of the jersey. The Indians also planned to wear numbers in this fashion. The Yankees were rained out on opening day, April 16, while the Indians played, making Cleveland the first MLB franchise to wear numbers on the back. The Yankees debuted their numbered jerseys two days after, April 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/1005/uni-watch-who-needs-uniform-numbers Uni Watch: Who needs uniform numbers?]&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s, all MLB teams wore numbers; in 1937 the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] finally began wearing numbers on both home and away jerseys, making numbers a universal trait in the MLB. The first MLB game to feature both teams wearing numbers on their jerseys was the game between the Indians and the Yankees on May 13, 1929.

===Numbers on other spots of the uniform===
In 1951, the [[Springfield Cubs]] of the [[International League]] pioneered the look of having numbers on the front of the jersey. A year later, the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] incorporated the idea into MLB.  They had intended numbers-on-front to be first used in their 1951 World Series appearance, an event which did not occur because of Bobby Thomson's [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|walk-off home run]] in the last game of the [[1951 National League tie-breaker series|tiebreaker series]] between the [[1951 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] and the [[1951 New York Giants (MLB) season|Giants]]. Today, numbers on the front are very common at all levels of play. In 1940, the [[Memphis Red Sox]] of the [[Negro American League]] wore numbers on their pants leg; the idea didn't catch on in MLB until the 1975-78 [[Houston Astros|Astros]] wore numbers on their front left hip.

Today, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] are the only Major League team to wear a number on the sleeve of their jerseys.

==Rules about numbers==
The official rules of baseball state that uniforms must be identical for all members of a team. The only mention of uniform number is that it must be on the back and a minimum of six inches tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule1.shtml |title=Baseball Rules: 1.00 Objectives of the Game |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date=1958-06-01 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each player must have their own unique number, but there is no rule requiring coaches to have unique numbers. For example, in 2015, [[Alan Trammell]] (who wore number 3 for his lengthy career as a [[Detroit Tigers]] player and manager) returned to coach first base and wore 3 again, despite the number belonging to [[Ian Kinsler]] at the time, marking a rare instance of a coach sharing a number with a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freep.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2015/08/22/alan-trammell-detroit-tigers/32209287/ |title=Tigers' Alan Trammell back to No. 3 while coaching first |first=Anthony |last=Fenech |date=August 22, 2015 |work=Detroit Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deviations from the rules===
In their first career games, [[Cincinnati Reds]] outfielder [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] and [[Chicago White Sox]] pitcher [[Joe Horlen]] did not have jersey numbers. Both of these players were just called up to the big league team while it was on the road and the only uniform available had no number.

On September 27, 1999, [[Detroit Tigers]] center fielder [[Gabe Kapler]] took the field donning a numberless uniform. That day, the Tigers played their last game at historic [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] and, in honor of great Tigers of the past, members of the starting lineup wore the uniform numbers of corresponding members of an All-Time Detroit Tigers team voted on by the fans. Since Kapler played center field, he was to wear [[Ty Cobb]]'s uniform number, but since Cobb played before numbers were used, Kapler's back was blank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-fever.com/archive/index.php/t-68985.html |title=No Number [Archive] |publisher=Baseball Fever |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 100th anniversary of [[Fenway Park]] on April 20, 2012, the [[Boston Red Sox]] and New York Yankees wore 1912-style uniforms which had no numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=320420102 |title=Yankees spoil Red Sox's 100-year celebration of Fenway Park |work=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Jackie Robinson Day]], teams across the MLB all wear uniform number 42 to honor him.&lt;ref name="jr-day"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/172342410/mlb-announces-jackie-robinson-day-details |title=MLB announces Jackie Robinson Day details |date=April 14, 2016 |publisher=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [See "Retired numbers," below.] The MLB has taken this tribute so far that, on that day only, all 30 team websites' active rosters say that every player on the team is number 42.

==Number assignments==
The original baseball numbers were based on the lineup. The starting players would be numbered 1-8, based on their spot in the order. The backup catcher would be number 9, and the pitchers would wear 10-14 (but not 13, as that is superstitious).&lt;ref name=jerseys&gt;[http://answers.yourdictionary.com/sports/why-do-baseball-players-wear-numbers-on-their-jerseys.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209110607/http://answers.yourdictionary.com/sports/why-do-baseball-players-wear-numbers-on-their-jerseys.html |date=December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of this system are teammates [[Babe Ruth]] (he was number 3 and batted third for the Yankees) and [[Lou Gehrig]] (number 4, batted fourth).

===Experiments with numbers by position===
Several teams experimented with numbering-by-position during the 1930s. In {{baseball year|1939}}, the [[Cincinnati Reds]], under [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Warren Giles]], introduced what would be the [[1939 Cincinnati Reds season#Roster|longest-lasting convention]], in which pitchers wore numbers between 30 and 49; outfielders between 20 and 29; infielders between 10 and 19; and catchers, coaches and managers in the single digits.  (An exception occurred in the early 1950s, when the Reds' coaches and managers were assigned numbers in the fifties.)&lt;ref name="fhb"&gt;[http://www.uni-watch.com/2011/01/04/numbers-game/ UniWatch.com 2011.01.04]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] adopted this system in [[1947 New York Giants (MLB) season#Roster|1947]], and when Giles became chief executive of the [[National League]] in 1952, many other NL clubs began to follow suit.  Two [[American League]] teams, the [[1961 Los Angeles Angels season#Roster|first edition]] of the [[expansion team|expansion]] [[Los Angeles Angels]] and the [[Cleveland Indians]] beginning in [[1963 Cleveland Indians season#Roster|1963]], also adopted the numbering scheme.&lt;ref name="fhb"/&gt;

In his {{baseball year|1969}} memoir, ''[[Ball Four]]'', pitcher [[Jim Bouton]] tells how he asked his new NL team, the [[Houston Astros]], for his traditional number 56, but was assigned [[1969 Houston Astros season#Roster|44]] instead because of the numbering custom. Bouton wrote: "I asked if there was any chance I could get 56. [The equipment manager] said he didn't think so, that all our pitchers have numbers in the 30s and 40s.  He said I'd have to talk to [general manager Spec] [[Spec Richardson|Richardson]] or manager [[Harry Walker]] if I wanted to change the rule. I said I was sure they wouldn't want to be bothered with something so small, and he said, 'Oh, you'd be surprised.'  Oh no I wouldn't."&lt;ref&gt;Bouton, Jim, ''Ball Four.'' New York and Cleveland, The World Publishing Company, 1970, page 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the number-by-position convention was never a formal rule, and a few National League clubs — notably the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] — resisted the idea. The custom was slowly abandoned during the 1970s and 1980s.  (In fact, in [[1970 Houston Astros season#Roster|1970]], the Astros assigned Bouton his traditional number 56.)

===Contemporary numbering conventions===
Today teams do not assign numbers based on any system; personal preference combined with retired numbers has made it impossible. However, a few trends do present themselves quite clearly:&lt;ref name=jerseys/&gt; Infielders, especially shortstops and second basemen, tend to be the players who would wear single digit numbers.  Single digit numbers, however, are not rare for outfielders or catchers.
* Numbers 1-14 are usually only worn by position players, while numbers 50 and above are more likely to be worn by pitchers. Numbers 60 and above are rarely worn in the regular season.  During [[spring training]], such high numbers are often given to players who are unlikely to make the regular-season team.  It is generally thought that the higher the number, the less chance of making the team. [[Houston Astros]] pitcher [[Dallas Keuchel]] is the only pitcher in the organization to wear 60
* The number 44 has been worn by many "power hitters" since [[Hank Aaron]]'s career as home run king (Aaron was number 44). Other notable examples include [[Willie McCovey]], [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Adam Dunn]], [[Anthony Rizzo]], and [[Paul Goldschmidt]].
* Number 49 is traditionally sought out by [[knuckleball]] throwing pitchers:&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGrath|first=Ben|title=Project Knuckleball|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 17, 2004|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact1?currentPage=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; notable examples include [[Hoyt Wilhelm]], [[Charlie Hough]], [[Tim Wakefield]], and [[Tom Candiotti]].

==Superstitions, attachments, and gimmicks==
Often players grow emotionally attached to a number. When a player switches teams, his number is often already in use. Since the MLB allows number changes at any time, bribes may occur for numbers. Among the most outrageous are when [[Brian Jordan]] joined the [[Atlanta Braves]] and gave then-third base coach [[Fredi González]] a $40,000 motorcycle for #33, and when [[Rickey Henderson]] joined the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and paid Turner Ward $25,000 for Henderson's long-time career #24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://keepingscore.blogs.time.com/2012/03/21/peyton-manning-will-wear-number-18-in-denver-why-exactly-do-we-care/ | work=Time | date=March 21, 2012 | title=Peyton Manning Will Wear Number 18 In Denver. Why, Exactly, Do We Care?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not every player pays top dollar for his number; when [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]] joined the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], he bought #28 from [[John Kruk]] for $10 and two cases of beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/19/sports/sp-d2comment19 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Jim | last=Litke | title=It's All a Big Numbers Game for These Players | date=June 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, Williams would change his number to #99 after [[Charlie Sheen|Rick "Wild Thing" Vaughn]], the character in the 1989 film, ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'', whose erratic pitching style resembled his own.

In 1951, independent ball player Johnny Neves wore the number 7 backwards because "Neves" spelled backwards is "seven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball to Bassist|url=http://goldenrankings.com/baseballoddfacts4.htm|website=goldenrankings.com|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Voiselle]], who is from [[Ninety Six, South Carolina]], wore #96 from 1947–1950 to honor his hometown. [[Carlos May]], who was born on May 17, wore number 17, meaning that his jersey read both his name and number and his birthday ("May 17").&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt;

Some players who are unable to acquire the number they had on their previous team will obtain a similar number. For example, [[Roger Clemens]] wore #21 during the first 15 years of his career with the Red Sox and Blue Jays and during his college days at the [[University of Texas]]. When he joined the Yankees and the [[Houston Astros]], he switched to #22. Upon Clemens' arrival in New York, he reportedly asked long-time Yankee outfielder [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] to surrender his #21, but O'Neill refused. Though he would eventually opt for #22, Clemens initially reversed his beloved #21, and wore #12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yankeenumbers.com/playersview.asp?key=427 |title=Roger Clemens – 1999 – #12 – YankeeNumbers.com – Database of Yankee Uniform Numbers Through the Years |publisher=YankeeNumbers.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clemens continued to wear #22 upon signing with his hometown Astros in 2004 and, upon re-signing with the Yankees, [[Robinson Canó]], owner of #22 at the beginning of the 2007 season, moved to #24 in anticipation of the Yankees possibly re-signing Clemens, leaving #22 available for Clemens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070123&amp;content_id=1784336&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy |title=Cano changes number, just in case &amp;#124; yankees.com: News |publisher=Newyork.yankees.mlb.com |date=2013-05-24 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Beimel]] has worn #97 throughout his career because his first child was born in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070503&amp;content_id=1944813&amp;vkey=news_la&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=la |title=Beimel feels at home with Dodgers &amp;#124; dodgers.com: News |publisher=Mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Wells]] wore #3 while with the Red Sox because his favorite player, Babe Ruth, wore #3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2005/03/14/2003246299 |title=David Wells looks forward to opening day with Red Sox |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2013-10-18 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he played with the Yankees, Wells could not have #3 (retired for Babe Ruth), so he wore #33. In his final season, playing for the Red Sox, [[J. T. Snow]] wore #84 to honor his father [[Jack Snow (American football)|Jack]], a former [[National Football League|NFL]] [[wide receiver]].

[[Eddie Gaedel]], the dwarf who made one plate appearance for the [[St. Louis Browns]], wore the number ⅛.  The uniform belonged to the young son of Browns executive [[Bill DeWitt]]. The boy, [[William DeWitt, Jr.]], was then the team's batboy; he is now the principal owner of the St. Louis Cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/page2/tvlistings/show73transcript.html ESPN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baseball Hall of Fame]] [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] never wore a digit on the back of his uniform with the Yankees (1931–1946) and Red Sox (1948–1950), despite managing during the era when numbers became widespread in Major League Baseball.

[[Joe Girardi]], in his managerial role with the Yankees, wore #27 to signify his desire to lead the team to their 27th championship.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3085167&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the [[2009 World Series]], he subsequently switched to #28.

==Retired numbers==
{{Main article|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}
The most legendary players, [[manager (baseball)|managers]], or [[coach (sport)|coaches]] on a team will sometimes have their uniform number [[Retired number|retired]], so that future players and coaches cannot wear those numbers with that team. Only the player with the retired number can wear that number if he returns to that team as a player or coach. Generally, such retirements are reserved for the very best, who in most cases, have impacted the entire league, and are most memorable.

The first [[Major League Baseball#MLB uniforms|Major League Baseball]] player to have his number retired was [[Lou Gehrig]] (#4). #4 and #5 have each been retired by 8 teams, more than any other number. The highest player uniform number to be retired was [[Carlton Fisk]]'s #72, but the Cardinals retired #85 in honor of their one-time owner [[August Busch, Jr.]]. Though he never wore a uniform, that is how old he was at the time of the honor. The [[Cleveland Indians]] retired the #455 in 2001 in honor of "the fans", to commemorate the then-longest home sellout streak ever (although MLB does not allow any team to issue three-digit uniform numbers).

Eight players and one manager, [[Casey Stengel]], have had their numbers retired with more than one team. [[Nolan Ryan]] had two different numbers (#30 and #34) retired among three different teams. Fisk's #27 from the Red Sox and #72 from the White Sox are both retired, as are [[Reggie Jackson]]'s #9 and #44, respectively, by the [[Oakland Athletics|A's]] and Yankees.

[[File:0G1G4040 Mariano Rivera.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Mariano Rivera was the last major league baseball player to wear #42]]
The New York Yankees have retired more numbers than any other team (19 numbers for 20 players), including all non-zero single digit numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/ |title=New York Yankees Team Page |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that many Yankees players get higher numbers because there aren't enough low numbers left.

The [[Toronto Blue Jays]] traditionally had not retired numbers, but have an alternative method of honoring their players called the 'Level of Excellence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/tor/history/level_of_excellence.jsp |title=Blue Jays Level Of Excellence &amp;#124; bluejays.com: History |publisher=Toronto.bluejays.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did retire [[Roberto Alomar]]'s number #12 in 2011, due to him being inducted into the Hall of Fame. They later retired number #32 in honor of [[Roy Halladay]], after his death. They also added him to the Level of Excellence.

On August 6, 2016 the Seattle Mariners retired #24 throughout the organization in honor of Ken Griffey Jr.'s induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He is the first Mariners player to have his number retired. 
 

===Jackie Robinson and number 42===
In 1997, Major League Baseball, for the first time ever, made a Major League-wide retirement of a number. Number 42 cannot be issued to any new players, having been retired in honor of [[Jackie Robinson]], although all players who currently wore the number upon the mass retirement of #42, such as [[Mo Vaughn]] and [[Butch Huskey]] of the Red Sox and Mets, were allowed to keep it under a [[grandfather clause]] if they were wearing the number in honor of Jackie Robinson. The clause also permitted such players who changed teams after the retirement date to retain #42 with their new team if it was available; thus, Vaughn (Red Sox, Angels, and Mets), [[Mike Jackson (right-handed pitcher)|Mike Jackson]] (Indians and Twins), and [[José Lima]] (Astros and Tigers) became the last players to wear the number #42 with two or more teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Robinsion | first = Craig | title = 42: Last Players to Wear the Number For Each Team | url=http://www.flipflopflyin.com/flipflopflyball/info-42.html |publisher = Flip Flop Fly Ball|date = April 2010 | accessdate = 2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the retirement of [[Mariano Rivera]] of the [[New York Yankees]] following the 2013 season, no MLB player currently wears #42 regularly. Art Silber, owner and coach of the Nationals' Class-A Affiliate Potomac, wears the number 42 as well. The [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], for whom Robinson played (as a Brooklyn Dodger), had already retired the number in 1972 before Robinson's death.

However, the #42 would be worn by a number of players other than Rivera in [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007]], which marked the 60th anniversary of Robinson's first appearance in Major League Baseball (the event that broke the sport's [[baseball color line|20th-century color line]]). Before the season, then-[[Cincinnati Reds]] outfielder [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] asked Robinson's widow, [[Rachel Robinson]], and MLB Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] for permission to wear #42 on April 15, the anniversary date of Robinson's historic game. Both gave their approval, and Selig later ruled that any player who wished to wear #42 on that date could do so. Three teams and several individual players on other teams wore #42 on that date; three other teams whose plans to wear #42 collectively were postponed due to rain on that date did so later in the month.  Since 2009, all players and coaches on all teams have worn #42 on April 15 in honor of Robinson.&lt;ref name="jr-day"/&gt;

Some feel that [[Roberto Clemente]] deserves a similar honor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buck|first=Ray|title=Baseball should retire Roberto Clemente's No. 21|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2010/07/17/2342561/baseball-should-retire-roberto.html|work=Star-Telegram|accessdate=22 September 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that #21 should be retired by all teams. Clemente opened the doors for [[Hispanic]]s to play Major League Baseball, just as Robinson did for [[African-Americans]]. He died in a plane crash in 1972 while helping [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|earthquake]] victims from Nicaragua, ending his storied career too soon. Number 21 is retired by Clemente's team, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], and was worn by [[Sammy Sosa]] throughout his career as a tribute to his childhood hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cunniff | first = Bill | title = Sosa plays host at party at his island mansion | page = 3 | work = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 1999-11-26 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB424463A5BF794&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | accessdate = 2008-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1250">The '''Warsaw Derby''' is a race for three-year-old [[Thoroughbred]] [[race horse]]s first run in 1874 at a [[racetrack]] in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. In addition to the purse money, the race winner receives the Prize of the President of the Republic of Poland.

The horses competing in the Warsaw Derby come from the countries associated in the [[Konferenz des Mitteleuropaeischen Turfs]] (KMET) organization. Beyond host Poland, the organization includes members from [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]].

Currently run at the [[Sluzewiec Racetrack]] in the [[Służewiec Przemysłowy|Służewiec]] sector of the city of Warsaw, the original race course no longer exists and is now the site of the [[Pole Mokotowskie]] park.

'''WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca''' (previously known as '''Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca''' and '''Laguna Seca Raceway''') is a paved [[Racing track#Motorsport|road racing track]] in [[central California]] used for both [[auto racing]] and [[Motorcycle sport|motorcycle racing]], built in 1957 near both [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] and [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[California]], United States.

The racetrack is {{convert|2.238|mi|km}} long, with a {{convert|180|ft|m}} elevation change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modified.com/roadtests/modp-1110-mazda-raceway-laguna-seca/index.html Modified.com - Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca - Track Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.modified.com/f/34973662/modp-1110-03+mazda-raceway-laguna-seca+track-map.jpg Detailed course map by Whitson Engineers]&lt;/ref&gt; Its eleven turns are highlighted by the circuit's signature turn, the downhill-plunging "Corkscrew" at Turns 8 and 8A. A variety of racing, exhibition, and entertainment events are held at the raceway, ranging from [[superkart]]s to sports car racing to music festivals.

The name Laguna Seca is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "dry lagoon":  the area where the track now lies was once a lake, and the course was built around the dry lake bed. After the course was reconfigured, two artificial ponds were added.

== History ==
[[Image:LagunaSecaMay08.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Laguna Seca Raceway from between Turns 1 and 2]]
[[File:Mario Andretti 1991 Laguna Seca.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mario Andretti]] at Laguna Seca, 1991]]
[[File:LagunaSecaOriginal.svg|thumb|right|The original layout]]
The earliest development of the local area occurred in 1867 with the founding of the nearby [[Laguna Seca Ranch]], which has operated continuously for 140 years with [[grazing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] uses.&lt;ref&gt;''Environmental Site Assessment: Laguna Seca Ranch'', Earth Metrics Inc., on file with the County of Monterey (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

The track was built in 1957 at a cost of $1.5 million raised from local businesses and individuals on part of the US Army's [[Fort Ord]] (a maneuver area and field artillery target range) after the nearby [[Pebble Beach Road Races]] were abandoned for being too dangerous. Since 1974, the property was deeded over to the [[Monterey County]] Parks Department and continues to be part of the park system.

The first race, held on November 9, 1957, was won by [[Pete Lovely]] driving a [[Ferrari]]. In the intervening years, the track has hosted USRRC, [[Can-Am]], [[Trans-Am]], [[Formula 5000]], [[IMSA GT Championship|IMSA GT]], [[Champ Car|CART]], [[American Le Mans Series]], [[Grand American]], [[Monterey Historic Automobile Races]], [[Speed World Challenge]], AMA ([[American Motorcyclist Association]]), WSBK [[Superbike World Championship]] and [[MotoGP]] motorcycle races (but 125/Moto3 and 250/Moto2 are not admitted).

The day-to-day operations of the track, along with the management and promotion of major racing events, are handled by the Sports Car Racing Association of the Monterey Peninsula (SCRAMP), which is a non-profit organization. With oversight by a board of local residents, SCRAMP operates with a professional staff on-site with the goal of generating income through the operations of the racetrack which is then redistributed to local charities.

The track itself has undergone significant changes over the past two decades to meet evolving safety [[homologation]] requirements of the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme]] (FIM), [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) and other sanctioning bodies. Changes include the addition of the entire infield area in 1988 (present day turns 3, 4, and 5, eliminating the straight that started at present day turn 2 and ended at present day turn 5) extending the track from its original {{convert|1.9|mi|km|adj=on}} length to meet the minimum-track-length criteria of the FIM for MotoGP events, plus the more recent relocation of [[pedestrian]] bridges and [[Embankment (transportation)|embankments]], and the expansion of [[gravel]] pits outside turns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 for additional runoff. The original media center was demolished in 2006 to make way for additional run-off room in Turn 1. Also in 2006, the 'hump' at the top of the Rahal Straight was flattened to accommodate the MotoGP riders, though some claim that this increases the wind effects that can perturb a race motorcycle. Remnants of the old configuration can still be seen from the parking lot between turns two and five. They are found underneath a road leading to the parking area for entrant trailers and RVs.

[[Image:Horag Corkscrew.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A view of the "Corkscrew" from the bottom]]
{{anchor|Corkscrew}}
The famous Turn 8 and 8A combination, popularly referred to as 'the Corkscrew', is considered one of the motorsport world's most challenging turns,{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} due to the 18-metre drop in elevation as well as its blind crest and apex on the uphill approach.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Mazda+Raceway+Laguna+Seca&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=34.861942,86.308594&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=36.584244,-121.748887&amp;spn=0,359.997366&amp;t=h&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=36.584343,-121.748854&amp;panoid=udrYf4y2Ja8H454cVpYO2w&amp;cbp=12,1.5996056991563416,,0,5 Google Street View image]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Andretti Hairpin}}
Turn 2, with its difficult and technical double-apex, has been renamed the 'Andretti Hairpin', in honor of former Formula 1 World Champion [[Mario Andretti]], while Turn 9 has been renamed 'Rainey Curve' in honor of 500cc [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] World Champion [[Wayne Rainey]], a resident of nearby [[Salinas, California]]. Also the straight that runs between Turn 6 and Turn 7 has been renamed the 'Rahal Straight' after four-time consecutive Champ Car race winner [[Bobby Rahal]].

A [[Champ Car]] World Series weekend had been a prominent event from 1983 through 2004, when its spot on the calendar was shifted to the [[San Jose Grand Prix]]. On the last lap of the 1996 CART race, [[Alex Zanardi]] passed [[Bryan Herta]] on the inside of the Corkscrew to take the victory. Uruguayan driver [[Gonzalo Rodríguez (racing driver)|Gonzalo Rodríguez]] died during the practice session of the 1999 CART race after crashing at the same corner. Because of the incident, runoff was installed at the end of the Rahal Straight.

Champ Car announced on September 11, 2007 that they would be returning the Northern California race to Laguna Seca from San Jose over the May 16–18 weekend in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=12226 Champ Car &gt; News Tuesday, September 11, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916032348/http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=12226 |date=September 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But the subsequent merger of Champ Car and [[Indy Racing League|IndyCar]] resulted in the race being canceled.

The track is also the site of the annual [[Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion]], formerly known as the Monterey Historic Automobile Races. The event features an extraordinarily eclectic mixture of race cars on the course. Each year features a different marque.  Considered one of the two greatest historic racing events (along with the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed|Goodwood Festival]] in England), attendance often rivals, or surpasses the professional racing events listed above.

There are many permanent dry and hook-up [[camping]] facilities located at the raceway, which are available year-round as part of the Laguna Seca Recreation Area, the county park in which the racetrack is set.

The track's primary corporate sponsor is [[WeatherTech]] which began April 2018. As part of the sponsorship, the track is now officially referred to as WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca. Previously, the sponsorship belonged to [[Mazda]] for 17 years with the track being known as Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.

A study by [[California State University, Monterey Bay]] and commissioned by SCRAMP states that the raceway generates $62.1 million to the [[Monterey County]] economy and $5.2 million in state and local taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CSUMB Economic Study: Mazda Raceway Contributed $62M To Monterey County In 2015|url=http://www.mazdaraceway.com/homepage-middle-pod/csumb-economic-study-mazda-raceway-contributed-62m-monterey-county-2015|publisher=Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Racing ==
Major events each year include the US round of the [[World Superbike Championship]] (held in conjunction with a round of the [[MotoAmerica]] championship), [[Monterey Sports Car Championships]] ([[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]]), and the Monterey Historics for classic racecars.

===Formula One===
In 1989, the year following the last [[Detroit Grand Prix|Formula One race in Detroit]], choices for a new location for the [[United States Grand Prix]] came down to Laguna Seca and [[Phoenix street circuit|Phoenix]]. The aforementioned 1988 improvements to the track were made in part to lure the F1 race. In the final decision, Laguna Seca was thought to be too remote and too small for an F1 crowd, and so Phoenix was granted the Grand Prix.

==Lap records==
On August 20, 2006, [[Toyota F1]] test driver [[Ricardo Zonta]] set an unofficial lap record of 1:06.309.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyota.com/montereyhistoric/history.html Zonta breaks the record, part three...] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516150404/http://www.toyota.com/montereyhistoric/history.html |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous record time was 1:07.722, set by [[Hélio Castroneves]] in a Penske [[Champ Car]] during qualifying for the 2000 CART Honda Grand Prix of Monterey. The unofficial record was re-taken by a Champ Car on March 10, 2007 by [[Sébastien Bourdais]], who lapped in 1'05.880 during Champ Car Spring Training. The unofficial record was again re-taken by a Formula One car on May 19, 2012 by [[Marc Gené]], who lapped in 1'05.786 in a [[Ferrari F2003-GA]] during the 2012 Ferrari Racing Days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoblog.com/2012/05/23/ferrari-claims-unofficial-lap-record-at-laguna-seca/&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially, Castroneves is still the recordholder as the times of Zonta, Bourdais and Gené were set during exhibition and testing sessions, and official records can only be set in race conditions (either in practice, qualifying, or during a race).

At the [[2008 Monterey Sports Car Championships]], [[David Brabham]] set a pole position time of 1:10.103 in a Le Mans Prototype.&lt;ref name="LMP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsaracing.net/2008/events/laguna/ALMS_FinalGrid.pdf |title=ALMS Final Grid |publisher=[[International Motor Sports Association]] |format=PDF |date=2008-10-18 |accessdate=2008-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315071957/http://www.imsaracing.net/2008/events/laguna/ALMS_FinalGrid.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fastest lap at the 2006 [[A1GP]] race was 1:17.951, set by [[Nicolas Lapierre]].

At the [[2012 United States motorcycle Grand Prix]], [[Jorge Lorenzo]] set a pole time of 1:20.554 on the Yamaha. During the [[2014 Superbike World Championship season]], [[Tom Sykes]] set a time of 1:21.811 on the Kawasaki.&lt;ref&gt;http://resources.worldsbk.com/files/results/2014/USA/SBK/Q2A/BES/BestLapsAndSpeeds.pdf?version=c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Porsche]] [[Porsche 918|918 Spyder]] held the previous production car lap record with 1:29.89.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/exotic/1503_2015_mclaren_p1_vs_2015_porsche_918_spyder/track_performance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 [[Dodge Viper|Dodge Viper ACR]] holds the current [[Dodge Viper#Official lap records|production car lap record with 1:28.65]].

The 2019 [[Jaguar XE|Jaguar XE Project 8]] holds the current four-door production sedan lap record with 1:37.54 set by driver Randy Pobst. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gtplanet.net/jaguars-project-8-smashes-the-sedan-lap-record-around-laguna-seca/|title=Jaguar's Project 8 Smashes the Sedan Lap Record Around Laguna Seca|date=2018-09-17|work=GTPlanet|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During qualifying for the 2011 FIM e-Power International Championship/[[TTXGP]] World Series race, [[Steve Rapp]] rode the [[Mission Motors]] Mission R to the electric vehicle record with 1:31.376. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.asphaltandrubber.com/racing/e-power-ttxgp-laguna-seca-qualifying-2011/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17th September 2018 Tesla Roadstar development driver Emile Bouret &lt;ref&gt; https://twitter.com/ebouret/status/1041513650119303168?s=21&lt;/ref&gt;shared in Twitter &amp; Instagram &lt;ref&gt; https://www.instagram.com/p/BnzpDdynFCK/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=f68y614b11hg &lt;/ref&gt;that he with the assistance of Development Engineering Team of [[Tesla, Inc.]] in a stock [[Tesla Model S]] P100D completed the lap in 1:43:06 &lt;ref&gt; https://twitter.com/ebouret/status/1041513650119303168?s=21&lt;/ref&gt; officially breaking the overall Fastest Production EV lap record &amp; also an unofficial recent lap time of  1:46.8 by amateur driver Cameron Rogers in a [[Tesla Model 3]] on September 14 2018. Currently Emile Bouret officially holds the Fastest Production EV lap record is this circuit. Cameron Rogers narrowly beat out the previous lap record of 1:48.18 set by professional driver Randy Pobst in a [[Jaguar I-PACE]].&lt;ref&gt;https://electrek.co/2018/09/15/tesla-model-3-performance-laguna-seca-record/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other use ==

===Automotive===
When not being used by the major events the track can be rented.  Approximately twice a year the [[Sports Car Club of America]] holds regional club races for the San Francisco Region.  Various clubs rent the track throughout the year for informal high performance driving schools that allow the public to drive their own cars at speed. The raceway has also played host to prototype testing of the [[Nissan GT-R]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/GeneralFuture/articleId=119632 2009 Nissan Skyline GT-R conquers the Corkscrew at Laguna Seca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609025115/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/GeneralFuture/articleId=119632 |date=2008-06-09 }} By Ed Hellwig '''Edmunds Inside Line''' 2/16/2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The track is featured in [[video game]]s such as the [[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]] series (including the bike version [[Tourist Trophy (video game)|Tourist Trophy]]), [[Forza Motorsport]], and the [[MotoGP '07|MotoGP]] series.  In a bid to compare real life versus video games, [[Jeremy Clarkson]] of the British automotive show ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' attempted to beat his [[Gran Turismo 4|Gran Turismo]] time of 1:41.148 in a [[Honda NSX]] by racing the real track in the same car in 2005.  During the trials, Clarkson determined that the game omitted a few details of the track, and the game's physics allowed him to brake later when coming into turns than he could in real life.  As a consequence, reality prevailed and he managed a best time of only 1:57 on the real course.&lt;ref&gt;Top Gear, Season 7, Episode 6 2005.12.27&lt;/ref&gt;  However, both he and the track instructor agreed that it is possible to complete the course in 1:41 in a Honda NSX if the driver were sufficiently experienced, talented, and most importantly fearless.

It was also used in 1975 for the film ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' as a qualifying track.

===Other non-automotive events===
Laguna Seca and the part of the old [[Fort Ord]] that is now [[Bureau of Land Management]] land annually host the [[Sea Otter Classic]] "Celebration of Cycling". The event has now become the largest cycling festival in the United States, bringing in over 10,000 racers and over 100,000 spectators - and is now the first major event of the year, typically held in April – for both the [[road bike]] and [[mountain bike]] professional seasons.

Several times each year, bicycles are permitted on the track for 2 hours.  The admission fee is $10 per bicycle rider.

Laguna Seca served as the finish line for Stage 4 of the [[2016 Tour of California|2016 Amgen Tour of California]] and
Stage 3 of the [[2018 Tour of California|2018 Amgen Tour of California]] bicycle races.

The raceway has been occasionally as a venue for concerts and other non-sporting events. The [[Grateful Dead]] performed on the racetrack in May 1987; Later that night, the band filmed their music video for "[[Touch of Grey]]" there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Browne |first1=David |title=See Incredible Live Photos of the Grateful Dead |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-dead-come-alive-bob-minkins-live-photos-of-the-grateful-dead-19206/laguna-seca-monterey-california-may-1987-239169/ |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=18 November 2018 |date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behind The Scenes Of The Making Of Grateful Dead 'Touch Of Grey' Video 1987 |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/behind-scenes-making-grateful-dead-touch-grey-video-1987 |website=JamBase |accessdate=18 November 2018 |date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 1987, [[Pope John Paul II]] celebrated mass at Laguna Seca Raceway, where 72,000 people had gathered to see him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-12/sports/sp-8841_1_indy-car | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Laguna Seca Indy Car Race | first=Shav | last=Glick | date=October 12, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1990s, the raceway was the venue for the Laguna Seca Daze music festival, which featured performances from music acts in the [[Contemporary folk music|folk]], [[alternative rock]] and [[jam band]] genres. Artists who performed at the festival include [[Bob Dylan]], [[Phish]], [[Blues Traveler]], [[10,000 Maniacs]], [[Big Head Todd and the Monsters]], [[Meat Puppets]], [[4 Non Blondes]], [[Jeff Healey]], [[The Allman Brothers Band]], [[Gin Blossoms]] and [[Shawn Colvin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sun, 1993-05-30 Laguna Seca Raceway |url=http://phish.com/tours/dates/sun-1993-05-30-laguna-seca-raceway/ |website=Phish |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sun, 1994-05-29 Laguna Seca Raceway |url=http://phish.com/tours/dates/sun-1994-05-29-laguna-seca-raceway/ |website=Phish |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sat, 1993-05-29 Laguna Seca Raceway |url=http://phish.com/tours/dates/sat-1993-05-29-laguna-seca-raceway/ |website=Phish |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laguna Seca Daze {{!}} The Official Bob Dylan Site |url=https://www.bobdylan.com/date/1995-05-27-laguna-seca-daze/ |website=www.bobdylan.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, 2011, John Mueller of Muellerized Suspension Systems married Sheila Stone on the top of the Corkscrew at Laguna Seca. This is the location where the ashes of Lee Mueller (4 time SCCA National Champion, IMSA GTU Champion, 3 time winner of the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], and [[12 Hours of Sebring]] winner), John Mueller's father, were spread.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muellerized.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Withdean Stadium''' is an athletics stadium in [[Withdean]], a suburb of [[Brighton]]. Between 1999 and 2011 it was the home ground of [[soccer|football]] team [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.]].

==Use by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.==
The capacity of the ground was 8,850 people, all seated. The stadium was temporary home for Brighton whilst a [[Falmer Stadium|new stadium]] was built in nearby [[Falmer]]. The club's former stadium, the [[Goldstone Ground]], was sold for redevelopment in 1997 by the board of the time, none of whom any longer has any involvement with the club. This resulted in the team playing their home matches for two seasons at [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham's]] [[Priestfield Stadium]], over {{convert|70|mi|km}} from Brighton, before moving to Withdean Stadium. The only other local option for Albion had been to play at [[Sussex CCC]]'s [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]].

Withdean Stadium was voted the fourth worst stadium in the UK by ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,1324085,00.html "Simply the worst"], Gemma Clarke, [[The Observer]], 10 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The temporary nature of the stadium is obvious - the stadium is primarily used for athletics; there is a single permanent stand along the north side, while the other stands are assembled from scaffolding, some of which has also served as temporary seating at the [[Open Championship]] golf tournament. The largest is the South Stand, running the entire length of the pitch. The east end of the pitch contains two medium-sized and one small stand. One of the larger stands here is designated as the family stand. The West Stand was the designated away stand. Changing and hospitality facilities are provided with portable cabins placed haphazardly around the site, and there is very limited on-site car parking.

There was considerable opposition in the neighbourhood to allowing the club to use the stadium. After some unique concessions were made, the club was allowed to move into Withdean in 1999. Amplified music was banned during football matches (except for the traditional "[[Sussex by the Sea]]"), and matchday parking restrictions were imposed within a one-mile radius of the ground. After a year, the music restrictions were eased, but the parking limitations continued in force. The price of each match ticket included a public transportation voucher allowing free bus or rail travel throughout the Brighton and Hove area.

For Albion's match against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 2 October 2004 the stadium was temporarily renamed [[wikt:Palookaville|Palookaville]] as it hosted the launch party for [[Fatboy Slim]]'s [[Palookaville (album)|album of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/archive/2004/10/04/The+Argus+Archive/6711083.Fatboy_calls_the_tune/ |title=Fatboy calls the tune |work=The Argus |accessdate=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released on [[Skint Records]], then the club's shirt sponsor, and for that match the team wore shirts bearing the name Palookaville instead of Skint. The name Palookaville was also considered appropriate by fans because it reflected the inadequacy of the club's temporary home.

Additional seating was added at the East and West Ends of the ground in November 2005. The club played their last game at Withdean on Saturday 30 April 2011 against [[Huddersfield Town F.C|Huddersfield Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9002049.Police_praise_Albion_fans_after_last_game_at_Withdean/ |title=Police praise Albion fans after last game at Withdean |work=The Argus |accessdate=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the temporary seating used at Withdean, is now being used by [[Whitehawk F.C.|Whitehawk FC]] at East Brighton Park.

== Stadium management ==

The stadium was managed and maintained under contract from [[Brighton and Hove]] city council by [[D C Leisure Management]]. The staff responsible for the preparation and maintenance of the stadium on match days used to be employed and managed by D C Leisure (when the company was called Ecovert Management Limited) until the 2003–2004 football season when responsibility of match day stadium staff was handed over to [[Brighton and Hove Albion F.C.]].

The staff responsible for the leisure facilities of the stadium complex including the gym, squash and tennis courts, spa and the stadium on non-match days are still employed and managed by D C Leisure.
