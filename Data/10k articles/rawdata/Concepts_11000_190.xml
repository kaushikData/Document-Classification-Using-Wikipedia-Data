The '''12-hour clock''' is a time convention in which the 24 hours of the day are divided into two periods: a.m. (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''ante meridiem'', translates to, before midday) and p.m. (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''post meridiem'' translates to, past midday).&lt;ref name=EncyclopaediaBritannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title =Time | encyclopedia =The New Encyclopædia Britannica | volume =28 | pages =660 2a | year= 1986 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title =Time | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition | url = http://library.eb.com.au/eb/article-61027| accessdate = 20 November 2013}} {{subscription required}}&lt;br /&gt;"The use of AM or PM to designate either noon or midnight can cause ambiguity. To designate noon, either the word noon or 1200 or 12 M should be used. To designate midnight without causing ambiguity, the two dates between which it falls should be given unless the 24-hour notation is used. Thus, midnight may be written: May 15–16 or 2400 May 15 or 0000 May 16."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NISTFAQ/&gt; Each period consists of 12 hours numbered: ''12'' (acting as zero),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.csusb.edu/faculty/susan/number_bracelets/mod_arith.html |title=Modular Arithmetic |date=25 August 2016 |accessdate=28 November 2008 |author=Susan Addington |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704121745/http://www.math.csusb.edu/faculty/susan/number_bracelets/mod_arith.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,'' and ''11''. The 24 hour/day cycle starts at 12 midnight (may be indicated as 12 a.m.), runs through 12 noon (may be indicated as 12 p.m.), and continues to the midnight at the end of the day. The 12-hour clock has been developed from the middle of the [[second millennium]] BC to the 16th century [[Anno Domini|AD]].

The 12-hour time convention is common in several English-speaking nations and former British colonies, as well as a few other countries.

==History and use==
[[File:Exeter Cathedral astronomical clock.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Exeter Cathedral Astronomical Clock]], showing the double-XII numbering scheme]]
The natural day-and-night division of a calendar day forms the fundamental basis as to why each day is split into two cycles.
Originally there were two cycles; one cycle which could be tracked by the position of the Sun (day) followed by one cycle which could be tracked by the Moon and stars (night).
This would eventually evolve into the two 12-hour periods that started at midnight (a.m.) and noon (p.m.) which are used today.  Noon itself is rarely abbreviated today, but if it is, it is denoted M.&lt;ref name=EncyclopaediaBritannica/&gt;

The 12-hour clock can be traced back as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013135550/http://www.arcytech.org/java/clock/clock_history.html|title=The History of Clocks|date=13 October 2008|access-date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both an Egyptian [[sundial]] for daytime use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aon.at/sundials/berlin-egypte.htm|title=Berlin instruments of the old Eg.time of day destination|website=members.aon.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and an Egyptian [[water clock]] for night-time use were found in the tomb of Pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html A Walk through Time - Water Clocks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531063139/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |date=31 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dating to c. 1500 BC, these clocks divided their respective times of use into 12 hours each.

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] also used a 12-hour clock: daylight was divided into 12 equal hours (thus hours having varying length throughout the year) and the night was divided into four watches.

The first mechanical clocks in the 14th century, if they had dials at all, showed all 24 hours, used the [[24-hour analog dial]], influenced by astronomers' familiarity with the [[astrolabe]] and sundial, and their desire to model the [[Earth's rotation|Earth's apparent motion around the Sun]].
In [[Northern Europe]] these dials generally used the 12-hour [[numbering scheme]] in [[Roman numerals]], but showed both ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' periods in sequence. This is known as the double-XII system, and can be seen on many surviving clock faces, such as those at [[Wells Cathedral clock|Wells]] and [[Exeter Cathedral#Clock|Exeter]].

Elsewhere in Europe, particularly in [[Italy]], numbering was more likely to be based on the 24-hour system (I to XXIV), reflecting the Italian style of counting the hours. The 12-hour clock was used throughout the British empire.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, the 12-hour analog dial and time system gradually became established as standard throughout Northern Europe for general public use. The 24-hour analog dial was reserved for more specialized applications, such as [[astronomical clock]]s and chronometers.

Most analog clocks and watches today use the 12-hour dial, on which the shorter hour hand rotates once every 12 hours and twice in one day. Some analog clock dials have an inner ring of numbers along with the standard 1-to-12 numbered ring.  The number 12 is paired either with a 00 or a 24, while the numbers 1 through 11 are paired with the numbers 13 through 23, respectively. This modification allows the clock to be read also in the [[24-hour notation]]. This kind of 12-hour clock can be found in countries where the 24-hour clock is preferred.

===Use by country===
{{Main|Date and time representation by country}}
[[File:Westclox Big Ben.jpg|thumb|left|Typical [[Clock#Analog clocks|analogue 12-hour clock]]]]
In several countries the 12-hour clock is the dominant written and spoken system of time, predominantly in nations that were part of the former British Empire, for example, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Malaysia]] and others follow this convention as well such as [[Egypt]], [[Mexico]] and the former American colony of the [[Philippines]]. In most countries, however, the [[24-hour clock]] is the standard system used, especially in writing. Some nations in Europe and Latin America use a combination of the two, preferring the 12-hour system in colloquial speech but using the 24-hour system in written form and in formal contexts.

The 12-hour clock in speech often uses phrases such as '' ... in the morning, ... in the afternoon, ... in the evening,'' and ''...at night''. In the United Kingdom, these descriptive phrases are still used. ''Rider's British Merlin'' almanac for 1795 and a similar almanac for 1773 published in London used them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4881611 National Library of Australia catalogue entry] for ''Rider's British merlin: for the year of Our Lord God 1795''&lt;/ref&gt;. Other than English-speaking countries, the terms ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' are seldom used and often unknown.

===Computer support===
In most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. Most operating systems, including [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]] and [[macOS]], activate the 12-hour notation by default for a limited number of language and region settings. This behavior can be changed by the user, such as with the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system "Region and Language" settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/customize-how-time-is-displayed-in-windows/|title=How to customize how the time is displayed in Windows|author=Lawrence Abrams|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=26 October 2013|publisher=Bleeping Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbreviations==

[[File:Digital-clock-alarm.jpg|thumb|Typical [[digital clock|digital]] 12-hour alarm clock indicating ''p.m.'' with a dot to the left of the hour]]The [[Latin]] abbreviations ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' (often written "am" and "pm", "AM" and "PM", or "A.M." and "P.M.") are used in [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario panhispánico de dudas, [http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?lema=hora2 HORA] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalents in [[Greek language|Greek]] are {{lang|el|π.µ.}} and {{lang|el|µ.µ.}}, respectively, and in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] {{lang|si|පෙ.ව.}} ({{transl|si|''pe.va.''}}) for {{lang|si|පෙරවරු}} ({{transl|si|''peravaru''}}, {{lang|si|පෙර}} {{transl|si|''pera''}} - fore, pre) and {{lang|si|ප.ව.}} ({{transl|si|''pa.va.''}}) for {{lang|si|පස්වරු}} ({{transl|si|''pasvaru''}}, {{lang|si|පස්සේ}} {{transl|si|''passē''}} - after, post). However, noon is rarely abbreviated in any of these languages, noon normally being written in full. In Portuguese, there are two official options and many other used, for example, using 21:45 pm: 21h45 or 21h45min (official ones) or 21:45 or 9:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. In [[Irish language|Irish]], ''a.m.'' and ''i.n.'' are used, standing for ''ar maidin'' ("in the morning") and ''iarnóin'' ("afternoon") respectively.

Most other languages lack formal abbreviations for "before noon" and "after noon", and their users use the 12-hour clock only orally and informally.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} However, in many languages, such as Russian and Hebrew, informal designations are used, such as "9 in the morning" or "3 in the night".

When abbreviations and phrases are omitted, one may rely on sentence context and societal norms to reduce ambiguity. For example, if one commutes to work at "9:00", 9:00 a.m. may be implied, but if a [[social dance]] is scheduled to begin at "9:00", it may begin at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.

==Related conventions==

===Typography===
The terms "a.m." and "p.m." are abbreviations of the Latin ''ante meridiem'' (before midday) and ''post meridiem'' (after midday). Depending on the [[style guide]] referenced, the abbreviations "a.m." and "p.m." are variously written in [[small capital]]s ("{{smallcaps|am}}" and "{{smallcaps|pm}}"), [[uppercase]] letters without a [[Period (punctuation)|period]] ("AM" and "PM"), uppercase letters with [[Periods.|periods]], or [[lowercase]] letters ("am" and "pm" or, more commonly, "a.m." and "p.m.").

Some stylebooks suggest the use of a space between the number and the a.m. or p.m. abbreviation.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Style guides recommend not using a.m. and p.m. without a time preceding it,&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Diana, A Writer's Reference, six edition, Bedford, St Martin's, Boston, 2007, section M4-c, p.308.&lt;/ref&gt; although doing so can be advantageous when describing an event that always happens before or after noon.

The hour/minute separator [[Date and time representation by country|varies between countries]]: some use a colon, others use a [[period (punctuation)|period]] (full stop), and still others use the letter h. In many instances using the 24-hour clock, there is no separator between hours and minutes (0800, read as written, i.e. "oh-eight-hundred").

====Encoding====
In Unicode, there exist symbols for:
: "a.m." {{unichar
| 33C2
| &lt;!-- Unicode name --&gt;
| ulink =
| image =
| size  = 150%
| html  =
}} and
: "p.m." {{unichar
| 33D8
| &lt;!-- Unicode name --&gt;
| ulink =
| image =
| size  = 150%
| html  = }}.

They are meant to be used only with [[CJK characters|Chinese-Japanese-Korean]] character sets, as they take up exactly the same space as one [[Chinese character]].

===Informal speech and rounding off===
It is common to round the time to the nearest five minutes and express the time as so many minutes past an hour, for example, "five past five" or "five to five".15 minutes is often expressed as "a quarter" such as "a quarter past five" and 30 minutes as "half past five" or merely "half five"). The time would be spoken as 8:45, and "''(a) quarter to'' ''nine''".&lt;ref&gt;''American Heritage Dictionary,'' 3rd ed. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1992). s.v. usage note at end of "quarter" entry.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in situations where the relevant hour is obvious or has been recently mentioned, speakers can use terms "quarter to" and "half past" to avoid elaborate sentences in particularly informal conversations. These forms are often commonly used in television and radio broadcasts that cover multiple time zones at one-hour intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=TVTimes|date=21–27 May 1983|url=http://forums.doyouremember.co.uk/threads/8061-TVTimes-magazine-21-27-May-1983-part1|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of meaning 5:30, the "half five" expression is sometimes used to mean 4:30, or "half-way to five", especially for regions such as the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]] and other areas that have been particularly [[German America|influenced by German culture]]. This meaning follows the pattern choices of many Germanic and [[Slavic languages]], including [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], as well as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

===Formal speech and times to the minute===
{{redirect|O'clock|the o'clock watch|O bag}}
Minutes may be expressed as an exact number of minutes past the hour specifying the time of day (e.g., 6:32&amp;nbsp;p.m. is "six thirty-two"). Additionally, when expressing the time using the "past (after)" or "to (before)" formula, it is conventional to choose the number of minutes below 30 (e.g., 6.32 pm is conventionally "twenty-eight minutes to seven" rather than "thirty-two minutes past six").

In spoken English, full hours are often represented by the numbered hour followed by ''o'clock'' (10:00 as ''ten o'clock'', 2:00 as ''two o'clock''). This may be followed by the "a.m." or "p.m." designator, though phrases such as ''in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening,'' or ''at night'' more commonly follow analog-style terms such as ''o'clock, half past three,'' and ''quarter to four. O'clock'' itself may be omitted, telling a time as ''four a.m.'' or ''four p.m.'' Minutes ":01" to ":09" are usually pronounced as ''oh one'' to ''oh nine'' (''nought'' or ''zero'' can also be used instead of ''oh''). Minutes ":10" to ":59" are pronounced as their usual number-words. For instance, 6:02&amp;nbsp;a.m. can be pronounced ''six oh two a.m.'' whereas 6:32&amp;nbsp;a.m. could be told as ''six thirty-two a.m.''

It is not always clear what times "12:00 a.m." and "12:00 p.m." denote. From the [[Latin]] words ''meridies'' (midday), ''ante'' (before) and ''post'' (after), the term ''ante meridiem'' (a.m.) means before midday and ''post meridiem'' (p.m.) means after midday. Since "noon" (midday - ''meridies'' (m.)) is neither before nor after itself, the terms a.m. and p.m. do not apply.&lt;ref name=NISTFAQ /&gt;  Although "12 m." was suggested as a way to indicate noon, this is seldom done&lt;ref name="chicago" /&gt;  and also does not resolve the question of how to indicate midnight.

''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' states "By convention, ''12 AM'' denotes midnight and ''12 PM'' denotes noon. Because of the potential for confusion, it is advisable to use ''12 noon'' and ''12 midnight''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=AM AM] at the ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fifth Edition (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

E. G. Richards in his book ''Mapping Time'' provided a diagram in which 12 a.m. means noon and 12 p.m. means midnight.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. G., ''Mapping Time: the Calendar and its History'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The style manual of the [[United States Government Printing Office]] used 12 a.m. for noon and 12 p.m. for midnight until its 2008 edition, when it reversed these designations,&lt;ref name="GPO2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GPO2008" /&gt; later maintained in its 2016 revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/features/new-edition-gpo-style-manual|title=New Edition of the GPO Style Manual - govinfo|website=www.govinfo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many U.S. style guides, and [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]'s "Frequently asked questions (FAQ)" web page,&lt;ref name=NISTFAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/times-day-faqs|title=Times of Day FAQs |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|date=21 September 2016|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommend that it is clearest if one refers to "noon" or "12:00&amp;nbsp;noon" and "midnight" or "12:00&amp;nbsp;midnight" (rather than to "12:00&amp;nbsp;p.m." and "12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m."). The NIST website states that "12 a.m. and 12 p.m. are ambiguous and should not be used."

''The Associated Press Stylebook'' specifies that midnight "is part of the day that is ending, not the one that is beginning."&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; Thus, according to AP style, "midnight Friday" occurs one minute after 11:59&amp;nbsp;p.m. Friday, not one minute before 12:01&amp;nbsp;a.m. Friday.

''The Canadian Press Stylebook''&lt;ref name="CP"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canadian Press Stylebook|edition= 11th |date = 1999 | at = page 288}}&lt;/ref&gt; says, "write ''noon'' or ''midnight'', not ''12 noon'' or ''12 midnight''." Phrases such as "12 a.m." and "12 p.m." are not mentioned at all. Britain's National Physical Laboratory "FAQ-Time" web page&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;[http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/time-frequency/time/faqs National Physical Laboratory, ''FAQ-Time'']&lt;/ref&gt; states "In cases  where the context cannot be relied upon to place a particular event, the pair of days straddling midnight can be quoted"; also "the terms 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. should be avoided."

Likewise, some U.S. style guides recommend either clarifying "midnight" with other context clues, such as specifying the two dates between which it falls, or not referring to midnight at all. For an example of the latter method, "midnight" is replaced with "11:59 p.m." for the end of a day or "12:01 a.m." for the start of a day. That has become common in the United States in legal contracts and for [[airplane]], [[bus]], or [[train]] schedules, though some schedules use other conventions. Occasionally, when trains run at regular intervals, the pattern may be broken at midnight by displacing the midnight departure one or more minutes, such as to 11:59&amp;nbsp;p.m. or 12:01&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abelliogreateranglia.co.uk/f/62130/62130.pdf ''Interim train timetables''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526154117/http://www.abelliogreateranglia.co.uk/f/62130/62130.pdf# |date=26 May 2015 }}, Abellio Greater Anglia, London, 17 May 2015, pages 7 and 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abnormality''' (or '''dysfunctional behavior''') is a behavioral characteristic assigned to those with conditions regarded as rare or dysfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;Psychology: Core Concepts, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior is considered abnormal when it is atypical or out of the ordinary, consists of undesirable behavior, and results in impairment in the individual's functioning.&lt;ref&gt;A Cross-sectional Study in Iranian Population, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Abnormality is that which is considered deviant from specific societal, cultural and ethical expectations. These expectations are broadly dependent on age, gender, traditional and societal categorizations. The definition of abnormal behavior is an often debated issue in [[abnormal psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification and Assessment of Abnormal Behavior|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hcpsy002/Nevid_ch03.pdf|website=csun.edu|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of these subjective variables.  

''Abnormal'' behavior should not be confused with ''unusual'' behavior. Behavior that is out of the ordinary is not necessarily indicative of a mental or psychological disorder. Abnormal behavior, on the other hand, while not a mental disorder in itself, is often indicative of mental and psychological disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118625392.wbecp308|title=The Encyclopedia of Clinical Psychology|last=Marty|first=Meghan A.|last2=Segal|first2=Daniel L.|publisher=American Cancer Society|pages=1–6|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118625392.wbecp308}}&lt;/ref&gt; A psychological disorder is defined as an "ongoing dysfunctional pattern of thought, emotion, and behavior that causes significant distress, and is considered deviant in that person's culture or society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology and Modern Life (13th ed)|last=Butcher|first=James|last2=Mineka|first2=Susan|last3=Hooley|first3=Jill|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|year=2007|isbn=|location=Boston, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important to note is that abnormal behavior, as it relates to psychological disorders, would be "ongoing" and a cause of "significant distress". A [[mental disorder]] describes a patient who has a medical condition whereby the medical practitioner makes a judgement that the patient is exhibiting abnormal behavior based on the DSM-5 criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/medical-model.html|title=The Medical Model|last=McLeod|first=Saul|date=2014|website=Simply Psychology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, simply because a behavior is unusual does not make it abnormal; it is only considered abnormal if it meets these criteria.

==Several conventional criteria==
There are five main criteria of abnormality. They are: 
# Statistical Criterion
# Social Criterion
# Personal Discomfort
# Maladaptive Behaviour
# Deviation from Ideal

Abnormal behaviors are "actions that are unexpected and often evaluated negatively because they differ from typical or usual behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Durand, V., &amp; Barlow, D. (2016). Essentials of Abnormal Psychology.  Boston, MA: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''The following Criteria are subjective:'''

* [[maladaptivity|Maladaptative]] and Malfunctional behaviors. Behaviors which, due to circumstance, are not fully adapted to the environment become malfunctional and detrimental to the individual or others. For example, a mouse continuing to attempt an escape when escape is obviously impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-05-02|title=Medical paradigms for the study of problem behaviour: a critical review|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159102002861|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|language=en|volume=81|issue=3|pages=265–277|doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(02)00286-1|issn=0168-1591}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

*Behavior that violates the standards of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-35465-1_2|title=First Responder’s Guide to Abnormal Psychology|date=2007|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|isbn=9780387351391|pages=13–18|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-35465-1_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people do not follow the conventional social and moral rules of their society, the behavior is considered abnormal. (See Deviation from Social Norms)
*Observer discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;David Rosenhan &amp; Martin Seligman (1984) ''Abnormal Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt; If a person's behavior brings discomfort to those in observation, it is likely to be considered abnormal. 

The standard criteria in psychology and [[psychiatry]] is that of [[mental illness]] or [[mental disorder]]. Determination of abnormality is based upon [[medical diagnosis]].

'''Other Criteria'''

*'''Statistical Infrequency''': Statistically rare behaviors are called abnormal. Though not always the case, the presence of abnormal behavior in people should be rare or statistically unusual. Any specific abnormal behavior may be unusual, but it is not uncommon for people to exhibit some form of prolonged abnormal behavior at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/numbers.cfm | title=Mental Illness in America | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991009122407/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/numbers.cfm | archivedate=1999-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Deviation from Social Norms''' defines the departure or deviation of an individual from society's unwritten rules (norms). For example, if one was to witness a man jumping around, nude, on the streets, the man would be perceived as abnormal, as he has broken society's norms about wearing clothing. There are also a number of criteria for one to examine before reaching a judgment as to whether someone has deviated from society's norms. The first of these criterion being ''culture''; what may be seen as normal in one culture, may be seen as abnormal in another. The second criterion being the ''situation &amp; context'' one is placed in; for example, going to the toilet is a normal human act, but going in the middle of a supermarket would be seen as highly abnormal, i.e., defecating or urinating in public is illegal as a misdemeanor act of indecent public conduct. The third criterion is ''age''; a child at the age of three could get away with taking off clothing in public, but not a man at the age of twenty. The fourth criterion is gender: a male responding with behavior normally reacted to as female, and vice versa, is retaliated against, not just corrected. The fifth criterion is historical context; standards of normal behavior change in some societies, sometimes very rapidly.
*'''FF: Failure to Function Adequately.''' A behavior is abnormal if the individual is unable to cope with the demands of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/abnormal-psychology.html|title=Abnormal Psychology {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists can disagree on the boundaries that define what is 'functioning' and what is 'adequately', however, as some behaviors that can cause 'failure to function' are not seen as bad. For example, a firemen risking their lives to save people in a blazing fire. 
*'''DIM: Deviation from Ideal Mental health''' defines abnormality by determining if the behavior the individual is displaying is affecting their mental well-being. As with the Failure to Function definition, the boundaries that stipulate what 'ideal mental health' is are not clearly defined. A frequent problem with the definition is that all individuals at some point in their life deviate from ideal mental health, but it does not mean the behavior is abnormal. For example, someone who has lost a relative is distressed and deviates from "ideal mental health" for a time, but their distress is not defined as abnormal, as distress is an expected reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/53659.php|title=Complicated Grief Needs Specific Treatment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common approach to defining abnormality is a '''Multi-Criteria''' approach, where all definitions of abnormality are used to determine whether an individual's behavior is abnormal. For example, psychologists would be prepared to define an individual's behavior as "abnormal" if the following criteria are met. 

* The individual is engaging in behavior that is preventing them from functioning. 

* The individual is engaging in behavior that breaks a social norm. 

* The individual is engaging in behavior that is statistically infrequent. 

A good example of an abnormal behavior assessed by a multi-criteria approach is [[depression (mood)|depression]]: it is commonly seen as a deviation from ideal mental stability, it often stops the individual from 'functioning' a normal life, and, though it is a relatively common mental disorder, it is still statistically infrequent. Most people do not experience significant [[major depressive disorder]] in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/25766.php|title=How prevalent is mental illness in the USA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, depression and its associated behaviors would be considered abnormal. 

Though not mentioned by many psychologists a lot of abnormal people can all agree that they were bullied into social ostracism when they were in school or by their families, they would tell you how people were consistently angry with them. For example: 

Kid A: Loves things that are the social norms, loves the expected interests that Kid A was told to love by parents and loved ones, has a group of friends that loves everything Kid A loves and respects.  

Kid B: Sees Kid A and his group of friends and wants to fit in with Kid A’s friends, he does everything he can to fit in to the social norms and expected interests Kid A loves, Kid A sees Kid B takes an interest in Kid A, Kid A gets ferociously offended and yells at Kid B to NEVER do those things again. Kid B then, feels alone,sad and empty and eventually finds something NOT liked by everyone and then LOVES it.

[[File:Rodoljub Šabić.jpg|thumb|Rodoljub Šabić, Commissioner for Information and protection of personal data]]
'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Serbia]], access to public information is guaranteed in the Constitution and protected by the Law on free Access to Information of Public Importance adopted in 2003 and amended in 2007 and 2009. 
The '''scope of the right''' entails that everyone in Serbia has the right to access to information of public importance and to be informed whether public authorities hold specific information, whether such information is already accessible, and to obtain a copy of the requested information.&lt;ref name="Serbia Commissioner for Information"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/en/contents-of-the-right.html| title= Contents of the right regarding access to information of public importance |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= 17 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Protection of personal data is the authority entitled by law to monitor the respect of obligations entailed by this Law.

==Legal framework==
Serbia is considered among the countries with the best regulatory framework regarding access to information of public relevance: the Global Right to Information Rating, compiled by NGOs AccessInfo and Centre for Law and Democracy, ranks the country in the second position in its global ranking assessing the quality of legislative frameworks regulating FOI across the world.&lt;ref name="RTI Rating"&gt;{{cite web |date=2016 |title=Global Right to Information Rating |url=http://www.rti-rating.org/view_country/?country_name=Serbia |access-date= 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of access to public information is defined in Article 51 of the [[Constitution of Serbia]], which establishes the right of everybody to be informed about issues of public importance and the deriving obligation of state bodies and public organizations to guarantee the access to such information.&lt;ref name= "Serbian Constitution"&gt;{{cite constitution |article= 51 |section= II |country= Serbia |language= en |ratified=2006 |url=http://www.srbija.gov.rs/cinjenice_o_srbiji/ustav.php?change_lang=en |accessdate=17 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access to information of public relevance is translated into national law by the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance adopted in 2003 and amended in 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/en/pravni-okvir-pi/laws-pi/881-zakon-o-slobodnom-pristupu-informacijama-od-javnog-znacaja-preciscen-tekst-sl-glasnik-rs-12004-5407-10409-i-3610.html | title=Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance |access-date= 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of the law is valued positively especially inasmuch as it extends the right to access to information '''to all natural person''', notwithstanding their citizenship, temporary or permanent residence in the country.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

Moreover, the right to access information applies to the executive, legislative and judicial bodies, State-owned enterprises, as well as other public authorities and private bodies that perform a public function or that receive significant public funding are also obliged to disclose information of public relevance (Art. 3).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

Requests should be lodged in written form, with no need for the applicant to specify the reason for the request.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;
The public authority shall reply without delay and within 15 days at the latest. If the requested information entails consequences for the protection of a person's life or freedom, public health and the environment, the time span at the disposal of authorities is reduced to 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt; In cases in which the document contains information that the public has no legitimate interest to know, the applicant has the right to access to other parts of the documents.

Limitations to the right to access to information are defined in Article 9 of the Law, establishing that legitimate limitation may derive if the requested information exposes to risk the life, health, safety or another vital interest of a person; if it obstacles the work of the judiciary; if it threatens national defense, national and public safety, international relations or the government's ability to manage the national economic processes. Finally, classified information are excluded from the right.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

The authority in charge of monitoring the respect of the Law is the '''Commissioner for Information of Public Importance'''. The Commissioner is an independent, second-level appeal instance: if a public authority does not respond to the request within the deadline, the applicant may lodge a complaint with the Commissioner, except in cases prescribed by this Law (Art.16).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

The Commissioner is entitled by Law to issue decisions on disputed cases, and his/her decisions should be enforced by the Government of the Republic of Serbia if necessary (Art 28).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt; The Commissioner is appointed by the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia on proposal of the Committee of the National Assembly responsible for information. The position of the Commissioner for Information has been held since 2004 by Rodoljub Šabić, who was appointed for an initial 7-years term and then re-elected in 2011.

Aside from examining individual complaints related to violations of the right to free access to information, the Commissioner also addresses citizens’ requests asking how to exercise their right to information, provides to state authorities opinions about the implementation of the law, trainings for law implementation and takes part in activities related to the EU accession process.

It has been noted that a significant '''limitation of the right''' set forth in the Constitution is due to the restrictions applied to the admissibility of complaints against first instance decisions: a complaint is not admissible if “lodged against decisions of the National Assembly, the President of the Republic, the Government of the Republic of Serbia, the Supreme Court of Serbia, the Constitutional Court and the Republic Public Prosecutor” (Art. 22).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedominfo.org/2004/11/serbian-parliament-adopts-access-law/ FreedomInfo.org]{{Retrieved|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

Since the adoption of the Law on Access to Information in 2004, a significant increase in the number of requests has been registered by the entitled Commissioner, pointing to the positive fact that the right is increasing being used by citizens and media professionals in Serbia. At the same time, the increasing number of complaints filed to the Commissioner demonstrates the reluctancy by authorities to timely and fully comply with the obligation established by the Law on access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Serbia/Serbia-the-hard-fight-for-information-177372 |title=Serbia: the hard fight for information |last=Maja|first=Poznatov |date=13 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Beta / Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa |access-date=24 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its annual report for 2015, the Commissioner for Information notes some limitation to the effective implementation of the law. These have to do, according to the Commissioner, particularly with insufficient accountability for violations of the Law and inefficient mechanisms of enforcement of the Commissioner’s decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/images/stories/dokumentacija-nova/izvestajiPoverenika/2015/IZVESTAJ2015/engrezime.pdf |title= Summary of the report on the implementation of the law on Free Access to Information|last=Commissioner for Information in Serbia |date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the implementation of the Law on Access to Information in Serbia and its impact on the exercise of journalism, Freedom House has noted in 2016 that “Despite the existence of the 2004 Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, authorities frequently obstruct journalists’ efforts to obtain public information”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/serbia |title= Freedom of the press in Serbia|last=Freedom House |date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017|quote=“Despite the existence of the 2004 Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, authorities frequently obstruct journalists’ efforts to obtain public information”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern over implementation, alignment with European standards, endowment of resources to the Commissioner for Information and enforcement of his decisions is highlighted also by the [[European Union]] in its annual report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_serbia.pdf |title= EU Serbia Progress Report 2016| date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth Initiative for Human Rights v. Serbia===
A landmark case by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] related to the right to access to information in Serbia. 
In 2006, the Belgrade-based NGO [[Youth Initiative for Human Rights]] (YIHR) filed a request to the Serbian [[Security Intelligence Agency]] demanding information concerning the use of electronic surveillance measures by that agency in 2005. 
The Agency denied access to the requested information twice, first on grounds of secrecy and then, after a binding decision by the Commissioner for Information stating that the information should be made public, by declaring that it did not hold the requested information.&lt;ref name=Voohroof&gt;{{cite web| url=https://strasbourgobservers.com/2013/07/08/article-10-of-the-convention-includes-the-right-of-access-to-data-held-by-intelligence-agency/#more-2125 |title=Article 10 of the Convention includes the right of access to data held by an intelligence agency |last=Voorhoof |first=Dirk |date=8 July 2013 |website=Strasbourg Observer |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YIHR appealed to the European Court of Human Rights under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6]] and [[Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights|Article 10]] of the Convention.
In June 2013, the verdict of the ECtHR defined “unpersuasive” the argument used by the Agency according to which it did not hold the information requested and found that the restrictions imposed by the Serbian intelligence agency were not justified by domestic law and hence constituted a violation of article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=Voohroof/&gt;

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Aikyam ''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ऐक्यम्) means – oneness, unity, harmony, unanimity, identity or sameness or identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English dictionary|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=aikyam&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All thoughts of the [[Upanishads]] move around two fundamental ideas – [[Brahman]] and the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]; as a rule these terms are used synonymously, there is no difference between these two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of the Upanishads|author=paul Deussen|publisher=Cosimo Inc|pages=38,39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_Bea7AXHY4C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqXwU56xL4jIuATppoCwCQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main theme of Vedantic teaching is identity of the individual and the Total (''jiva isvara aikyam''), that the self (''Atman'') and awareness ('' [[Chaitanya (consciousness)|Chaitanya]] '') are identical (''aikyam''). ''Aikyam'' means oneness or identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Be Free From Me: Vedanta Notes|author=paul Bahder|publisher=Vision Of Vedanta|page=398|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdGwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT398&amp;lpg=PT398&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QqKexpc0-P&amp;sig=Q3CpsBRhFJbV-zHXno0HTTmhdu8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KqPwU7WyOMPHuASKjYCgDA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=aikyam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic purport==

The [[Vedas]] are part of oral tradition, therefore they are called '' [[Śruti]] '' (that which is heard), Upanishads, known as the Vedanta, are the destroyer of bondage. The oneness of the Individual Self and the Universal Self (''jīvātma paramātma aikyam'') is ''Śrutisara'', the ultimate purport of the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extracting the Essence of the Sruti|author=Totakacarya|page=ix|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=j-eq605vuwUC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_aPwU7O6JY-GuASqkIKQDA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=aikyam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the compound word – ''Brahman atman aikyam'', unity of the Brahman and the Atman, is described the fundamental dogma of the Vedanta system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upanishads Vol.3|publisher=Sarup and Sons|page=217|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgwzp6-HTTIC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqXwU56xL4jIuATppoCwCQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=aikyam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedic]] [[Rishis]] tell us – सत्त्वानुरूपा सर्वस्य श्रद्धा भवति – that undoubtedly the faith of all men conforms to their mental constitution, they speak about the two Unmanifests – the one which transforms itself and causes other transformations, and the other one that supports the former it had projected with the intention of commencing creation, although there is no real difference between these two. Rishi [[Dirghatamas]] ([[Rig Veda]] I.163.4) prays to [[Agni]] thus:-
: त्रीणि त आहुर्दिवि बन्धनानि त्रीण्यप्सु त्रीण्यन्तः समुद्रे |
: उतेव मे वरुणश्च्छन्त्स्यर्वन्यत्रा त आहुः परमं जनित्रम् ||
: "The place of your origin or birth is the same as that of mine; if you are endowed with strength I too possess the same strength; O the bright one! If you so happen to exist in three states or forms (gross, subtle and causal) so does water (the finest divine aspects) and the earth (the gross supporting aspect) and all objects (the entire transformation of the First Cause) dispersed in space (as existing outside and within) have three forms, O learned one! if your birth and knowledge is divine so is mine. "

This unique awareness of Sameness which is actually the awareness of Oneness is the knowledge of Reality, the true knowledge of existence, gaining which knowledge the true seeker ceases to see difference in this vast world of "variety" which difference is seen only as so many names echoing and re-echoing persistently in one’s mind. Rishi Venobhargavah ([[Rig Veda]] IX.85.9) also speaks about the same knowledge of Oneness when he prays:-
: अधिद्यामस्थाद्वष्भो विचक्षणोऽरूरुचद्वि दिवो रोचना कविः |
: राजा पवित्रमत्येति रोरुवद्दिवः पीयूषं दुहते नृचक्षसः ||
and tells us about the stars and celestial luminaries dotting the sky shining because of the light of the self-effulgent [[Brahman]] shining brightly revealing everything and providing strength and stability (अधिद्यामस्थात्),who is pure and the source of amrita (पीयूषं) desired by the learned people (नृचक्षसः), who is the giver of happiness and who is the deliverer being the only source of immortality.201-203&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=201-203|url= https://www.amazon.in/Books-Ravinder-Kumar-Soni/s?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A976389031%2Cp_27%3ARavinder%20Kumar%20Soni   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedanta contention==

[[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)|Vedantasara]] explains that the subject (''visheya'') is the identity of the individual self and Brahman, which is of the nature of Pure Intelligence (wherein all ideas of separation and variety are effaced) and is to be realized – सर्वे वेदा यत् पदमामनन्ति – That goal which all the Vedas declare ([[Katha Upanishad]] I.ii.15), and that the connection (''sambandha'') is the relation between that identity which is to be realized and the evidence of the [[Upanishads]] that establishes it, as between a thing to be known and that which tells of it.p.16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedantasara|author=Sadananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=16|url= http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Vedantasara-Nikhilananda.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Adi Shankara|sankara]] states that the notion of a multitude of souls is valid only at the level of the empirical world. While the ''Atman'' stays within the limits of the body, emotions and intellect, there cannot be any dissolution, any absolute unity (''sarvarthā- aikyam'') with Brahman; the soul is only the reflection of the higher ''ātman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shankara and Indian Philosophy|author=N.V.Isaeva|publisher=SUNY Press|page=223|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=J43SDe9ilOsC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqXwU56xL4jIuATppoCwCQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=aikyam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one reality. That about which the cognition does not change is ''sat'' – real and that about which cognition keeps changing or is negated is ''asat'' – unreal; the Atman or Brahman alone being unchangeable and un-negatable is the only ''sat'' or Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jivesvara Aikyam|publisher=speaking tree.in|url= http://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/masters/philosophy/jivesvara-aikyam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections==

According to [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]], ''aikyam'' cannot be real at all; if it were, the absolutism would have vanished. The Absolute is the only reality, ''aikyam'' cannot be another reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reign of Realism in Indian Philosophy|author=R.Naga Raja Sarma|publisher=National Press|page=152|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4aZbAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=aikyam&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1aTwU5-5EJCXuATCvYC4DA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBDgK }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, [[Nagarjuna]] explains – if there were to be identity of cause and effect, then there would be oneness of producer and the produce; if there were to be difference between cause and effect, then the cause would be equal to a non-cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Path|publisher=SUNY Press|page=289|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0O6_coQ1odMC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dqbwU9XHBMG-uASUuYGgDA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCTg8#v=onepage&amp;q=aikyam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annie Arniel''' (May 1873 – February 9, 1924) was a [[women's suffrage|suffragist]] and women's rights advocate. Born in [[Harrington, Delaware|Harrington]], [[Delaware]], United States, as Anna L. Melvin, she married George Arniel of Canada and was widowed in 1910. Annie played a key role in helping to win the women's vote in the United States.

Arniel was a factory worker, living in downtown [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Delaware]], when she was recruited by [[Mabel Vernon]] and [[Alice Paul]] for membership in the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP). As a member of the [[Silent Sentinels]] she was among the first six suffragists arrested and jailed on June 27, 1917, at the [[White House]]. She served eight jail terms for suffrage protesting: three days in June 1917; 60 days in the [[Lorton Reformatory|Occoquan prison]] in [[Virginia]], from August to September 1917, for picketing; 15 days for a meeting in [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]]; and five sentences of five days each in January and February 1919 for the NWP's watchfire demonstrations.

'''''Arsenault-Cameron v Prince Edward Island''''', [2000] 1 S.C.R. 3, 2000 SCC 1, is a landmark [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on [[minority language]] rights. The Court found that the numbers of Francophone children in [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island|Summerside]], [[Prince Edward Island]] warranted [[French language|French-language]] education in Summerside, under [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', and the province was constitutionally obligated to create a French language school.

==Background==
A number of Francophone families living in Summerside made a request to the [[French Language Board]] to build a French-language school in the community rather than bus the children to the closest French school 57 minutes away. The Board made a proposal to the [[Minister (government)|Minister]] which was rejected.

The family applied for a declaration against the province to build a school in Summerside. At trial the declaration was granted but was overturned on appeal.

In the decision of ''Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island'', [1999] 3 S.C.R. 851, prior to the language rights hearing, the counsel for the government sought to have [[Bastarache]] recuse himself for [[reasonable apprehension of bias]] due to his history of championing the French language. In an application to Bastarache, he held that he was not biased to hear the case, and so did not recuse himself.

==Opinion of the Court==
Major and Bastarache, writing for a unanimous court, applied a [[purposive interpretation]] to section 23 of the ''Charter''. He found that the purpose of the right is to redress past injustices and provide "an official language minority with equal access to high quality education in its own language in circumstances where community development will be enhanced."

'''Austin Hobart Clark''' (December 17, 1880 &amp;ndash; October 28, 1954) was an [[United States|American]] [[zoology|zoologist]]. He was born in  [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]] and died in [[Washington, D.C.]] His research covered a wide range of topics including [[oceanography]], [[marine biology]], [[ornithology]], and [[entomology]].

==Biography==

The son of Theodore Minot Clark and Jeannette French Clark, Clark obtained his Bachelor of Arts at [[Harvard University]] in 1903. He had five children with his first wife Mary Wendell Upham, whom he married on March 6, 1906. Mary died in December 1931 and Clark was remarried in 1933 to [[Leila F. Clark|Leila Gay Forbes]].

In 1901, Clark organized a scientific expedition to [[Isla Margarita]] in [[Venezuela]]. From 1903 to 1905, he conducted research in the [[Antilles]]. From 1906 to 1907, he led a scientific team aboard the 1882 [[USS Albatross (1882)|USS ''Albatross'']]. In 1908, he took a post at the [[National Museum of Natural History]], which he held until his retirement in 1950.

Clark had important and various roles in a number of [[learned society|learned societies]]: to name a few, he was president of the Entomological Society of Washington, vice president of the [[American Geophysical Union]], and directed the press service of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

Clark was author to more than 600 publications written in English, French, Italian, German, and Russian. Some of the most well-known include ''Animals of Land and Sea'' (1925), ''Nature Narratives'' (two volumes, 1929 and 1931), ''The New Evolution'' (1930), and ''Animals Alive'' (1948).

Several animal species and genera were first scientifically described by Clark, including the [[Lesser Antillean macaw]] (1905), the [[Martinique parrot]] (1905), the [[Dominican green-and-yellow macaw]] (1908), the [[mulga parrot]] (1910), the [[crustacean]] genus ''[[Laomenes]]'' (1919) or the [[starfish]] species ''[[Copidaster lymani]]'' (1948).
[[File:Diagram from Zoogenesis.png|thumb|"Three sumultaneous paths of development from the primitive single cell", ''Zoogenesis'']]

==Zoogenesis==

Clark is best known for his evolutionary theory called zoogenesis, which he introduced in his book ''The New Evolution: Zoogenesis'' (1930).&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;J. H. W. (1931). ''Reviewed Work: The New Evolution Zoogenesis by Austin H. Clark''. ''Science Progress in the Twentieth Century (1919-1933)'' 26 (101): 160.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory challenged the [[Tree of life (biology)|single tree view]] of [[evolution]], according to Clark the major types of life forms on earth evolved separately and independently from all the others.&lt;ref name="Numbers 2006"&gt;Numbers, Ronald L. (2006). ''[[The Creationists|The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design]]''. Harvard University Press. p. 53. {{ISBN|0-674-02339-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Clark wrote that "the seemingly simultaneous appearance of all the phyla or major groups of animals simply means that life at its very first beginnings developed at once and simultaneously from the primitive single cell in every possible direction, giving rise to some original form or forms in every phylum." He termed this process, ''eogenesis''.&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt;

Clark was [[Quoting out of context|quote-mined]] by creationists but he rejected any supernatural view of origins.&lt;ref name="Numbers 2006"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9379">{{Immanuel Kant}}

In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s philosophy, a '''category''' ({{lang-de|Categorie}} in the [[Critique of Pure Reason|original]] or ''Kategorie'' in [[modern German]]) is a pure concept of the [[#The table of judgments|understanding]] (''Verstand''). A Kantian category is a characteristic of the appearance of any object in general, before it has been experienced. Kant wrote that "They are concepts of an object in general…."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', B129, (''Sie sind Begriffe von einem Gegenstande überhaupt'')&lt;/ref&gt; Kant also wrote that, "…pure cоncepts [Categories] of the undеrstanding which apply to objects of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]] in general…."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 79 (''reine Verstandesbegriffe, welche a priori auf Gegenstände der Anschauung überhaupt gehen'')&lt;/ref&gt; Such a category is not a classificatory division, as the word is commonly used. It is, instead, the condition of the [[Epistemic possibility|possibility]] of objects in general,&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 139&lt;/ref&gt; that is, objects as such, any and all objects, not specific objects in particular.

== Meaning of "category" ==

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:κατηγορία|κατηγορία]], ''katēgoria'', meaning "that which can be said, predicated, or publicly declared and asserted, about something." A category is an attribute, property, quality, or characteristic that can be predicated of a thing. "…I remark concerning the categories…that their logical employment consists in their use as predicates of objects."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Jakob Sigismund Beck|Beck]] to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], June 20, 1797&lt;/ref&gt; Kant called them "ontological predicates."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'', Introduction, V&lt;/ref&gt;

A category is that which can be said of everything in general, that is, of anything that is an object. [[J.S. Mill|John Stuart Mill]] wrote: "The Categories, or Predicaments &amp;mdash; the former a Greek word, the latter its literal translation in the Latin language &amp;mdash; were believed to be an enumeration  of all things capable of being named, an enumeration by the ''summa genera'' (highest kind), i.e., the most extensive classes into which things could be distributed, which, therefore, were so many highest Predicates, one or other of which was supposed capable of being affirmed with truth of every nameable thing whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart, ''[[A System of Logic]]'', I, 3, §1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] had claimed that the following ten predicates or categories could be asserted of anything in general: substance, quantity, quality, relation, action, affection (passivity), place, time (date), position, and state. These are supposed to be the qualities or attributes that can be affirmed of each and every thing in experience. Any particular object that exists in thought must have been able to have the Categories attributed to it as possible predicates because the Categories are the properties, qualities, or characteristics of any possible object in general. The Categories of Aristotle and Kant are the general properties that belong to all things without expressing the peculiar nature of any particular thing. Kant appreciated Aristotle's effort, but said that his table was imperfect because " … as he had no guiding principle, he merely picked them up as they occurred to him..."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The Categories do not provide knowledge of individual, particular objects. Any object, however, must have Categories as its characteristics if it is to be an object of experience. It is presupposed or assumed that anything that is a specific object must possess Categories as its properties because Categories are predicates of an object in general. An object in general does not have all of the Categories as predicates at one time.  For example, a general object cannot have the qualitative Categories of reality and negation at the same time. Similarly, an object in general cannot have both unity and plurality as quantitative predicates at once. The Categories of Modality exclude each other. Therefore, a general object cannot simultaneously have the Categories of possibility/impossibility and existence/non&amp;ndash;existence as qualities.

Since the Categories are a list of that which can be said of every object, they are related only to human language. In making a verbal statement about an object, a speaker makes a judgment. A general object, that is, every object, has attributes that are contained in Kant's list of Categories. In a judgment, or verbal statement, the Categories are the predicates that can be asserted of every object and all objects.

==The table of judgments&lt;!--'Understanding (Kant)' redirects here--&gt;==
Kant believed that the ability of the human '''understanding'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (German: ''Verstand'', Greek: ''[[dianoia]]'' "διάνοια", Latin: ''[[ratio]]'') to think about and know an object is the same as the making of a spoken or written judgment about an object. According to him, "Our ability to judge is equivalent to our ability to think."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 80&lt;/ref&gt;
A judgment is the thought that a thing is known to have a certain quality or attribute. For example, the sentence "The rose is red" is a judgment. Kant created a table of the forms of such judgments as they relate to all objects in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 71&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Table of Judgements
|-
! Category !! colspan="3" style="text-align: center;" | Judgements

|}

This table of judgments was used by Kant as a model for the table of categories. Taken together, these twelvefold tables constitute the formal structure for Kant's [[Kantian architectonics|architectonic]] conception of his philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, "The Architectonic Form of Kant's Copernican Logic", ''Metaphilosophy'' 17:4 (October 1986), pp.266-288; revised and reprinted as Chapter III of Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 ''Kant's System of Perspectives'']: ''An architectonic interpretation of the Critical philosophy'' (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schemata==
Categories are entirely different from the appearances of objects. According to Kant, in order to relate to specific phenomena, categories must be "applied" through [[time]]. The way that this is done is called a [[Schema (Kant)|schema]].

==Criticism==
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], in his [[Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy|criticism of the Kantian philosophy]], found many errors{{Examples|date=September 2018}} in Kant's use of the Categories of Quality, Quantity, Relation, and Modality. Schopenhauer also noted that in accordance with Kant's claim, non-human animals would not be able to know objects. Animals would only know impressions on their [[sense organ]]s, which Kant mistakenly{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} calls [[perception]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19842">The '''Chinese Library Classification''' ('''CLC'''; {{Zh|c = 中国图书馆分类法|s = |t = }}), also known as '''Classification for Chinese Libraries''' ('''CCL'''),{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} is effectively the national [[library classification]] scheme in [[China]]. It is used in almost all primary and secondary schools, universities, academic institutions, as well as public [[libraries]]. It is also used by publishers to classify all books published in China.

The '''Book Classification of Chinese Libraries''' ('''BCCL''') was first published in 1975, under the auspices of China's Administrative Bureau of Cultural Affairs. Its fourth edition (1999) was renamed CLC. In September 2010, the fifth edition was published by National Library of China Publishing House.
CLC has twenty-two top-level categories, and inherits a [[Marxist]] orientation from its earlier editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joemls.dils.tku.edu.tw/fulltext/41/41-1/1-22.pdf Zhang, Wenxian (2003). ''Classification for Chinese Libraries (CCL): Histories, accomplishments, problems and its comparisons''. Journal of Educational Media &amp; Library Sciences, vol. 41, nr. 1, p. 1-22.] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; (For instance, category A is [[Marxism]], [[Leninism]], [[Maoism]] &amp; [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]].) It contains a total of 43600 categories, many of which are recent additions, meeting the needs of a rapidly changing nation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Standardization of Chinese Library Classification'', Xiaochun Liu, [[Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly]], Volume 16, Issue 2, ISSN 0163-9374, Pub Date: 8/13/1993

The '''''yángsuì''''' 陽燧 or '''sun-mirror''' was an [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient Chinese]] [[burning-mirror]] that concentrates sunlight to ignite tinder and the '''''fāngzhū''''' 方諸 or '''moon-mirror''' was a device that collects nighttime dew by condensation. These two bronze implements are literary metaphors for [[yin and yang]], associating the "''yang''-mirror" ''yangsui'' with the sun (a.k.a. ''tàiyáng'' [[wikt:太陽|太陽]] "great ''yang''"), fire, dry, and round, and the "''yin''-mirror" ''fangshu'' with the moon (''tàiyīn'' [[wikt:太陰|太陰]] "great ''yin''"), water, wet, and square.

==Terminology==
There are numerous Chinese names for the fire-producing ''yángsuì'' 陽燧 "sun-mirror" and water-producing ''fāngzhū'' 方諸 "moon-mirror".

===''Yangsui''===
[[File:Huabiao denglong.jpg|thumb|right|''Hou'' 犼 dragon sitting on a ''chenglupan'' 承露盤 "dew collecting plate" capping a ''[[huabiao]]'' column]]
'''''Yángsuì''''' &lt; [[Old Chinese]] '''*''laŋsə-lu[t]-s''''' can be written 陽遂 or 陽燧, [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]]  ''yáng'' [[wikt:陽|陽]] (of ''yīnyáng'') "sunshine; shining; sunny side" with ''suì'' [[wikt:遂|遂]] "advance; accomplish; achieve" or ''suì'' [[wikt:燧|燧]] (clarified with the [[Radical 86|fire radical]] [[wikt:火|火]]) "light a fire". Compare the mirrorless ''sui'' terms [[Suiren]] 燧人 (with "person") "a mythical sage who invented [[Firelighting#Friction|friction firelighting]]", ''suìshí'' 燧石 (with "stone") "flint", ''mùsuì'' 木燧 (with "wood"), meaning either "hearth-board" or "fire-drill", and ''fēngsuì'' 烽燧 (with "beacon") "beacon-fire". ''Yángsuìzú'' 陽燧足 "sun-mirror feet" is an old Chinese name for "[[brittle star]]". ''Suì'' 燧 also had early graphic variants 鐆 and 䥙, written with the [[Radical 167|metal radical]] 金 specifying the bronze mirror.

The ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' unabridged Chinese dictionary (1993, 11: 1974) gives three meanings for ''yángsuì'' 陽遂 (written without the "fire radical"): 亦作"阳燧" 古代利用日光取火的凹面铜镜 ["Also written 阳燧, a concave bronze mirror anciently used to start a fire from sunlight."]; 清畅通达貌 ["appearance of clear, unobstructed flowing"], which was first recorded in a poem (洞箫赋) by [[Wang Bao]] (c. 84 – c. 53 BCE); and 古代车上的一种采光装置 ["an ancient type of chariot window that admits light"], which was first recorded in the ''[[Book of Jin]]'' history covering 265 to 420 CE.

Three uncommon variant names for the concave fire-starting mirror are '''''fúsuì''''' &lt; '''*''[b]asә-lu[t]-s''''' 夫遂 (with [[wikt: 夫|夫]] "that") used in the ''Zhouli'' (below), '''''jīnsuì''''' &lt; '''*''k(r)[ә]msә-lu[t]-s''''' 金燧 (with [[wikt:金|金]] "metal") used in the ''Liji'' (below), and '''''yángfú''''' &lt; '''*''laŋ[b](r)o''''' 陽符 used in ''Taiping Yulan'' (below) (1993, 2: 1457).

English translations of the Chinese sun-mirror in classic texts (cited below) include:
*"metal speculum for getting fire from the sun" (Legge 1885)
*"burning-glass" (Forke 1907)
*"sun-mirror" (de Groot 1910)
*"burning mirror" (Needham and Wang 1962)
*"solar kindlers" or "igniters using ''yang''" (Schafer 1963)
*"burning-mirror" (Ware 1966)
*"burning mirror" (Major et al. 2010)

===''Fangzhu''===
The name '''''fāngzhū''''' &lt; '''*''C-paŋta''''' 方諸 combines ''fāng'' [[wikt:方|方]] "square; side; region" and ''zhū'' [[wikt:諸|諸]] "all; various". The ''Hanyu Da Cidian'' (1993, 6: 1570) gives two ''fāngzhū'' meanings: 古代在月下承露取水的器具 ["an ancient device used to collect dew in the moonlight in order to obtain water", with the oldest usage example from the ''Huainanzi'' (below); 传说中仙人住所 "a mythical place where ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' 'transcendents; immortals' reside"], which was first recorded in (c. 499) [[Shangqing School]] Daoist collection ''[[Zhen'gao]]'' 真誥 "Declarations of the Perfected", which says Fangzhu was named from being square, 1,300 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' on each side, and 9,000 ''[[Zhàng|zhang]]'' high. Gustave Schlegel (1875: 612) says the ''yangsui'' mirror is perfectly round and the ''fangzhu'' is ("le Carré total") "perfectly square", which is consistent with ''yanyang'' theory since roundness pertained to ''yang'' and heavenly fiery things, while squareness pertained to ''yin'' and earthly watery things. Umehara (1956: 142) described square mirrors believed to be from the [[Qin dynasty]]. ''Qīngtóng'' 青童 "Azure Lad", which is a [[homophone]] of ''qīngtóng'' 青銅 (lit. "azure copper") "bronze", is one of the main deities in [[Shangqing School|Shangqing Daoism]], and lord of the mythic paradise Fangzhu "Square Speculum Isle" in the eastern sea near [[Mount Penglai]] (Smith 2008: 803).

The (983) ''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' encyclopedia lists some ''yinyang'' synonyms of ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'', "The ''yangsui'' or '''''yángfú''''' &lt; '''*''laŋ[b](r)o''''' 陽符 (with ''fú'' [[wikt:符|符]] "tally; talisman; magic figure") obtains fire from the sun. The '''''yīnfú''''' &lt; '''*''q(r)um[b](r)o''''' 陰符 (cf. ''[[Huangdi Yinfujing|Yinfujing]]'' "Hidden Tally Scripture") or '''''yīnsuì''''' &lt; '''*''q(r)umsə-lu[t]-s''''' 陰燧 obtains water from the moon. They are copper amalgam mirrors, also named 'water and fire mirrors'."

''Chénglùpán'' 承露盤 "plate for receiving dew" is a near-synonym for ''fangzhu'' (Needham and Wang 1962: 89). The ''[[huabiao]]'', which is a type of [[Chinese architecture|Chinese architectural]] column traditionally erected in front of palaces and tombs, is topped by a mythical ''hou'' 犼 "a wolf-headed [[Chinese dragon]]" sitting on a round ''chenglupan'' "dew-collecting plate" cap.

There are comparatively fewer English translations of the Chinese moon-mirror, which lacks a direct translation equivalent and is more frequently  [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized]], include:
*"moon-mirror" (Forke 1907)
*"Yin mirror" (Needham and Wang 1962)
*"metal speculum for gathering water from the moon" (Ware 1966)
*"square speculum" (Smith 2008)
*"square receptacle" (Major et al. 2010)

==Mirror metaphors==
Metaphorically using ''fangzhu'' and ''yangsui'' mirrors to represent ''yin'' and ''yang'' reflects a more commonly used Chinese philosophical metaphor of a mirror to denote the ''[[Xin (concept)|xin]]'' 心 "heart-mind". For instance, the ''Zhuangzi'' famously says having a mirror-like ''xin'' represents the ideal state of unity with the Dao.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not be a corpse for fame, Do not be a storehouse of schemes; Do not be responsible for affairs, Do not be a proprietor of knowledge. Thoroughly embody unendingness and wander in nonbeginning. Thoroughly experience what you receive from heaven but do not reveal what you attain. Just be empty, that's all. The mind of the ultimate man functions like a mirror. It neither sends off nor welcomes; it responds but does not retain. Therefore, he can triumph over things without injury. (7, tr. Mair 1994: 70-71) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The stillness of the sage is not because stillness is said to be good and therefore he is still. It is because the myriad things are unable to disturb his mind that he is still. When water is still, it clearly reflects whiskers and brows. It is so accurate that the great craftsman takes his standard from it. If still water has such clarity, how much more so pure spirit! The stillness of the mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the looking glass of the myriad things. (13, tr. Mair 1994: 119-120) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many scholars of Chinese philosophy have analyzed the mirror metaphor for the ''xin'' "heart-mind". Harold Oshima (1983: 75) explains that for a modern Westerner who regards a mirror as a commonplace looking-glass, this metaphor "appears quite pedestrian and unexciting" until one realizes that the ancient Chinese imagined mirrors "to possess broad and mysterious powers." For instance, a mirror can reveal and control demons. The ''Baopuzi'' (above) says a Daoist practitioner entering the mountains would suspend a mirror on his back, which was believed to prevent the approach of demons—compare the European belief that a mirror is [[Vampire#Apotropaics|apotropaic toward vampires]] who are supposedly unable to produce a reflection. Oshima says the ''yangsui'' burning-mirror that miraculously produces fire best illustrates the "great sense of mystery surrounding mirrors". "Certainly this mirror symbolized a powerful connection with the greater powers of the heavens and, as such, would have served admirably as a model for the [''xin'']."
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the early Chinese, mirrors were not simply passive "reflectors" of information, they offered accurate and appropriate ''responses'' to whatever came before them. When placed before the sun—the ultimate ''yang'' 陽 phenomenon in the world—they respond with fire: the pure essence of ''yang''. When placed before the moon—the ultimate ''yin'' 陰 phenomenon in the world—they respond with water: the pure essence of ''yin''. Thus mirrors offer the paradigm for ''proper responsiveness'': they reflect the true essence of the ultimate ''yin'' and ''yang''—the alpha and omega of phenomena in early Chinese cosmology." (Carr and Ivanhoe 2000: 56) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Erin Cline says the early Chinese attributed mirrors to have a mysterious power and great religious significance. The ceremonial bronze ''fusui'' 夫遂 and ''yangsui'' 陽燧 mirrors were seen as active, responsive objects because they could be used to produce fire and water (two of the Five Phases). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When placed outside, concave mirrors focused sunlight to produce fire, while bronze mirrors gathered condensation in the light of the moon. But it was not simply the fact that mirrors had the power to ''gather'' or ''produce'' that made them objects of religious significance in ancient China; it was what they produced. Water and fire were thought to be the pure essences of ''yin'' and ''yang'', respectively, and the fact that mirrors appeared to ''draw'' these substances from the sun and moon reinforced the cosmological power that was already associated with them. (2008: 338)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Textual examples==
The [[Chinese classics]] contain early information about ''yangsui'' fire-mirrors and ''fangshu'' water-mirrors. The first two sources below are "ritual texts" of uncertain dates, and the others are presented chronologically.

===Zhouli===
The (c. 2nd century BCE) ''[[Zhouli]]'' "Zhou Rites" is a compilation of [[Zhou dynasty#Eastern Zhou|Eastern Zhou]] (771-256 BCE) texts about government bureaucracy and administration. It describes two kinds of ritual officials making the purifying "new fire". The ''Siguan'' 司爟 "Directors of Fire Ceremonies" used a ''zuānsuì'' 鑽燧 "[[Bow drill#Hand drill|fire-drill]]", for which a variety of different woods were chosen at five periods during the year (Biot 1881 2: 194). The ''Sixuanshi'' 司烜氏 "Directors of Sun Fire" ceremonially used a ''yangsui'' "burning-mirror" to start the "new fire".
&lt;blockquote&gt;They have the duty of receiving, with the [''fusui'' 夫遂] mirror, brilliant fire from the sun; and of receiving with the (ordinary) mirror [''jian'' 鑒] brilliant water from the moon. They carry out these operations in order to prepare brilliant rice, brilliant torches for sacrifices, and brilliant water. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 87, cf. Biot 1881 2: 381) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Zhouli'' commentary of [[Zheng Xuan]] (127–200) glosses  ''fusui'' as ''yangsui''. The sub-commentary of Jia Gongyan 賈公彦 says the ''fusui'' is called ''yangsui'' because it starts a fire by means of the ''jīng'' 精 "spirit; essence" of the ''taiyang'' "great ''yang''; sun".

===Liji===
Another ritual text similar to the ''Zhouli'', the (c. 2nd-1st century BCE) ''[[Liji]]'' "Record of Rites" is a compilation of Eastern Zhou textual materials. "The Pattern of the Family" section lists idealized duties of family members. Sons and daughters-in-law are supposed to wear a utility belt that includes metal and wood (two of the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]]) ''suì'' fire-starters: ''jīnsuì'' 金燧 "burning-mirror" and a ''mùsuì'' 木燧 "fire-drill", which implies that fire-mirrors were quite commonly used among the ancient Chinese (Forke 1911: 497).
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the left and right of the girdle [a son] should hang their articles for use—on the left side, the duster and handkerchief, the knife and whetstone, the small spike, and the metal speculum for getting fire from the sun [金燧]; on the right, the archer's thimble for the thumb and the armlet, the tube for writing instruments, the knife-case [or "needle-case" for a daughter-in-law], the larger spike, and the borer for getting fire from wood [木燧]. (tr. Legge 1885 27: 449, 450) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Zheng Xuan's ''Liji'' commentary glosses ''musui'' as ''zuānhuǒ'' 鑽火 "produce fire by friction". [[Kong Yingda]] (574 – 648) quotes Huang Kan 皇侃, "When it is daylight, use the ''jinsui'' to start a fire from the sun, when it is dark, use the ''musui'' to start a fire with a drill". The commentary of Sun Xidan 孙希旦 (1736-1784) says ''jinsui'' or ''yangsui'' 陽遂 "''yang'' burning-mirrors" should ideally be cast on the Summer Solstice and ''yinjian'' 陰鑒 "''yin'' mirrors" on the Winter Solstice.

The ''[[Chunqiu Fanlu]]'' (14), attributed to [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179–104 BC), says ''císhí'' 磁石 "[[lodestone]]" attracts iron and ''jǐngjīn'' 頸金 "neck metal; burning-mirror" attracts fire; [[Joseph Needham]] and [[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang Ling]] (1962: 88) suggest the name "neck metal" derives from either the mirror being hung round the neck, or because necks are concave things.

===Huainanzi===
[[Liu An]]'s (c. 139 BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]'' "Masters of Huainan", which is a compendium of writings from various schools of Chinese philosophy, was the first text to record ''fangzhu'' dew-collectors.

Two ''Huainanzi'' chapters metaphorically use "sun and moon mirrors" to exemplify ''yang'' and ''yin'' categories and elucidate the Chinese notion of ''[[ganying]]'' "cosmic resonance" through which categorically identical things mutually resonate and influence each other. The ''yángsuì'' 陽燧 "burning-mirror" is ''yang'', round, and sun-like; the ''fāngzhū'' 方諸 "square receptacle" is ''yin'', square, and moon-like. The first context describes ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' mirrors ''jiàn'' 見 "seeing" the sun and moon. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Way of Heaven is called the Round; the Way of Earth is called the Square. The square governs the obscure; the circular governs the bright. The bright emits ''qi'', and for this reason fire is the external brilliance of the sun. The obscure sucks in ''qi'', and for this reason water is the internal luminosity of the moon. Emitted ''qi'' endows; retained ''qi'' transforms. Thus yang endows and yin transforms. The unbalanced ''qi'' of Heaven and Earth, becoming perturbed, causes wind; the harmonious ''qi'' of Heaven and Earth, becoming calm, causes rain. When yin and yang rub against each other, their interaction [感] produces thunder. Aroused, they produce thunderclaps; disordered they produce mist. When the yang ''qi'' prevails, it scatters to make rain and dew; when the yin ''qi'' prevails, it freezes to make frost and snow. Hairy and feather creatures make up the class of flying and walking things and are subject to yang. Creatures with scales and shells make up the class of creeping and hiding things and are subject to yin. The sun is the ruler of yang. Therefore, in spring and summer animals shed their fur; at the summer solstice, stags' antlers drop off. The moon is the fundament of yin. Therefore when the moon wanes, the brains of fish shrink; when the moon dies, wasps and crabs shrivel up. Fire flies upward; water flows downward. Thus, the flight of birds is aloft; the movement of fishes is downward. Things within the same class mutually move one another; root and twig mutually respond to each other [相應]. Therefore, when the burning mirror sees the sun, it ignites tinder and produces fire [故陽燧見日則燃而為火]. When the square receptacle sees the moon, it moistens and produces water [方諸見月則津而為水]. When the tiger roars, the valley winds rush; when the dragon arises, the bright clouds accumulate. When ''qilins'' wrangle, the sun or moon is eclipsed; when the leviathan dies, comets appear. When silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the ''shang'' string [of a stringed instrument] snaps. When meteors fall, the Bohai surges upward. (3.2, tr. Major et al. 2010: 115-116) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second mentions some of the same ''yinyang'' and ''ganying'' folk-beliefs. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;That things in their [various] categories are mutually responsive [相應] is [something] dark, mysterious, deep, and subtle. Knowledge is not capable of assessing it; argument is not capable of explaining it. Thus, when the east wind arrives, wine turns clear and overflows [its vessels]; when silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the ''shang'' string [of a stringed instrument] snaps. Something has stimulated [感] them. When a picture is traced out with the ashes of reeds, the moon's halo has a [corresponding] gap. When the leviathan dies, comets appear. Something has moved them. Thus, when a sage occupies the throne, he embraces the Way and does not speak, and his nurturance reaches to the myriad people. But when ruler and ministers [harbor] distrust in their hearts, back-to-back arcs appear in the sky. The mutual responses [相應] of spirit ''qi'' are subtle indeed! Thus, mountain clouds are like grassy hummocks; river clouds are like fish scales; dryland clouds are like smoky fire; cataract clouds are like billowing water. All resemble their forms and evoke responses [感] according to their class. The burning mirror takes fire from the sun; the square receptacle takes dew from the moon [夫陽燧取火於日方諸取露於月]. Of [all the things] between Heaven and Earth, even a skilled astrologer cannot master all their techniques. [Even] a hand [that can hold] minutely tiny and indistinct things cannot grasp a beam of light. However, from what is within the palm of one's hand, one can trace [correlative] categories to beyond the extreme end point [of the cosmos]. [Thus] that one can set up [these implements] and produce water and fire is [a function of] the mutually [responsive] movement of yin and yang of the same ''qi''. (6.2, tr. Major et al. 2010:216-217) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Huainanzi'' commentary of [[Gao You]] (fl. 210 CE) says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The burning mirror is of metal. One takes a metal cup untarnished with verdigris and polishes it strongly, then it is heated by being made to face the sun at noon time; in this position cause it to play upon mugwort tinder and this will take fire. The [''fangzhu''] is the Yin mirror [''yinsui'' 陰燧]; it is like a large clam(-shell) [''dage'' 大蛤]. It is also polished and held under the moonlight at full moon; water collects upon it, which can be received in drops upon the bronze plate. So the statements of our ancient teacher are really true. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 88) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Needham and Wang (1962: 90), this comparison between a ''fangzhu'' mirror that drew water from the moon and a bivalve shell reflects an ancient Chinese confusion between beliefs about moon-mirrors and beliefs that certain marine animals waxed and waned in correspondence with the moon. For example, the (c. 3rd century BCE) ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The virtue of a ruler is what all the people obey, just as the moon is the root and fount of all Yin things. So at full moon, shellfish [''bangge'' 蚌蛤] are fleshy, and all that is Yin abounds. When the moon has waned, the shellfish are empty and Yin things weak. When the moon appears in the heavens all Yin things are influenced right down to the depths of the sea. So the sage lets virtue flow forth from himself, and the four outer wildernesses rejoice in his benevolent love. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 31) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The authors compare [[Aristotle]]'s (c. 350 BCE) ''[[Parts of Animals]]'' recording that some kinds of [[sea urchins]] were fat and good to eat at the full moon, which was one of the oldest biological observations about the lunar periodicity of the reproductive system of [[echinoderms]], especially sea urchins.

A third ''Huainanzi'' chapter accurately describes the importance of finding a ''sui'' burning-mirror's focal point. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Way of employing people is like drawing fire from a mirror [以燧取火]; if you're too far away [from the tinder], you won't get anything; if you're too close, it won't work. The right [distance] lies between far away and close. Observing the dawn, he [calculates] the shift [of the sun] at dusk; measuring the crooked, he tells [how far] something departs from the straight and level. When a sage matches things up, it is as if he holds up a mirror to their form; from the crooked [reflection], he can get to the nature [of things]. (17.227-228, tr. Major et al. 2010: 707-708) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Huainanzi'' frequently uses the term ''suìhuǒ'' 燧火 "kindle a fire", for instance, in the second month of summer, the Emperor "drinks water gathered from the eight winds and cooks with fire [kindled from] cudrania branches (5.5, tr. Major et al. 2010; 188).

===Lunheng===
[[File:Wu liang shrine relief depicting xihe, yi, and fusang tree.jpg|thumb|Houyi takes aim at the suns (right upper corner), rubbing from the Wu Liang shrines reliefs]]
[[Wang Chong]]'s (c. 80 CE) ''[[Lunheng]]'' mentions the ''fangzhu'' 方諸 in two chapters (46, 47), and the ''yangsui'' in five, written 陽遂 (8, 32) and 陽燧 (47, 74, 80).

The German sinologist Alfred Forke's (1907, 1911) English translation of the ''Lunheng'' consistently renders ''fangzhu'' as "moon-mirror" and ''yangsui'' as "[[burning-glass]]", because two chapters describe "liquefying five stones" (''wǔshí'' 五石) on a [[bingwu]] day (43rd in the 60-day [[sexagenary cycle]]) in the fifth [[Chinese calendar#Month|lunar month]]. Forke (1911: 496) circularly reasons that, "If this be true, the material must have been a sort of glass, for otherwise it could not possess the qualities of a burning glass. Just flint glass of which optical instruments are now made consists of five stony and earthy substances—silica, lead oxide, potash, lime, and clay. The Taoists in their alchemistical researches may have discovered such a mixture." The French sinologist [[Berthold Laufer]] (1915: 182-183, 187) refutes Forke's "downright literary concoction" of ''yangsui'' as "burning-glass" because Wang Chong's ''wushi'' 五石 "five stones" reference was a literary allusion to the [[Nüwa]] legend's ''wuseshi'' 五色石 "five-colored stone; multicolored stone", and because the Zhou Chinese did not have a word for "glass", which was unknown to them. Forke overlooked the (c. 320) Daoist text ''Baopuzi'' (below, Ware 1966: 294) that also describes smelting the "five minerals" (identified as realgar, cinnabar, orpiment, alum, and laminar malachite) on the ''bingwu'' day of a fifth month to make magic daggers that will protect travelers from water demons.

Both ''Lunheng'' contexts about casting a ''yangsui'' "burning-mirror" on a ''bingwu'' day use the phrase ''xiāoliàn wǔshí'' 消鍊五石 "smelting five minerals". The first contrasts burning-mirrors and crooked sword-blades.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The laws of Heaven can be applied in a right and in a wrong way. The right way is in harmony with Heaven, the wrong one owes its results to human astuteness, but cannot in its effects be distinguished from the right one. This will be shown by the following. Among the "Tribute of Yu" are mentioned jade and white corals. These were the produce of earth and genuine precious stones and pearls. But the Taoists melt five kinds of stones, and make five-coloured gems out of them. Their lustre, if compared with real gems, does not differ. Pearls in fishes and shells are as genuine as the jade-stones in the Tribute of Yu. Yet the Marquis of Sui made pearls from chemicals, which were as brilliant as genuine ones. This is the climax of Taoist learning and a triumph of their skill. By means of a burning-glass [陽燧] one catches fire from heaven. Of five stones liquefied on the [Bingwu] day of the 5th moon an instrument is cast, which, when polished bright, held up against the sun, brings down fire too, in precisely the same manner as, when fire is caught in the proper way. Now, one goes even so far as to furbish the crooked blades of swords, till they shine, when, held up against the sun, they attract fire also. Crooked blades are not burning-glasses; that they can catch fire is the effect of rubbing. Now, provided the bad-natured men are of the same kind as good-natured ones, then they can be influenced, and induced to do good. Should they be of a different kind, they can also be coerced in the same manner as the Taoists cast gems, Sui Hou made pearls, and people furbish the crooked blades of swords. Enlightened with learning and familiarized with virtue, they too begin by and by to practise benevolence and equity. (8, tr. Forke 1907: 377-378) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Needham and Wang interpret this ''Lunheng'' passage as an account of making glass burning-lenses. Despite Forke's translation of ''suíhòu'' 隨侯, with ''suí'' 隨 "follow; comply with; the ancient state [[Sui (state)|Sui]]" and [[Chinese nobility#Princehood and peerage|''hóu'']] 侯 "marquis", as the legendary "Sui Hou; Marquis of Sui" who received a fabulous pearl from a snake; they translate "following proper timing", citing the [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemical]] term ''huǒhòu'' 火候 "fire-times; times when heating should begin and end", and reading ''hóu'' 侯 "marquis" as a miscopy of ''hòu'' 候 "time; wait; situation".
&lt;blockquote&gt;But by following proper timing (i.e. when to begin heating and how long to go on) pearls can be made from chemicals [''yao'' 藥], just as brilliant as genuine ones. This is the climax of Taoist learning and a triumph of their skill. Now by means of the burning-mirror [''yangsui''] one catches fire from heaven. Yet of five mineral substances liquefied and transmuted on a [''bingwu''] day in the fifth month, an instrument [''qi'' 器] is cast, which, when brightly polished and held up against the sun, brings down fire too, in precisely the same manner as when fire is caught in the proper way. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 112) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Wang Chong gives three contrasts between "genuine" and "imitation" things: the opaque glass "jade" made by Daoist alchemists with the real thing; the artificially made "pearls" with true pearls; and the "instrument" made by liquefying five different minerals, which can concentrate the sun's rays like the traditional bronze burning-mirror. Furthermore, Needham and Wang question why the ''Lunheng'' specifies five different minerals, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bronze would require only two ores, perhaps even only one, with possible addition of a flux. Glass needs silica, limestone, an alkaline carbonate, and perhaps litharge or the barium mineral, together with colouring matter. Of course, the text does not clearly tell us that lenses were being made; the instruments might have been simply glass mirrors imitating the bronze ones. (1962: 113) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on archeological finds of glass objects substituting for jade and bronze ones in tombs dating back to the Warring States period, Needham and Wang (1962: 113) conclude that the Chinese were making glass [[lens (optics)|lenses]] in the 1st century CE, and probably as far back as the 3rd century BCE.

The second context explains ''[[ganying]]'' "cosmic resonance" with examples of ''bingwu'' burning-mirrors, moon-mirrors, and ''tulong'' 土龍 "[[Yinglong#Shanhaijing|clay dragons]]" believed analogously to cause rainfall like Chinese [[Chinese dragon|''long'' dragons]]. It describes a dispute between Han astronomer [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]], who used a clay dragon in a rain sacrifice, but could not explain the reason why it worked, when the scholar [[Huan Tan]] argued that only a genuine lodestone can attract needles.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The objection that the dragon was not genuine, is all right, but it is wrong not to insist on relationship. When an east wind blows, wine flows over, and [when a whale dies, a comet appears.] The principle of Heaven is spontaneity, and does not resemble human activity, being essentially like that affinity between clouds and dragons. The sun is fire, and the moon is water. Fire and water are always affected by genuine fluids. Now, physicists cast burning-glasses [陽燧] wherewith to catch the flying fire from the sun, and they produce moon-mirrors [方諸] to draw the water from the moon. That is not spontaneity, yet Heaven agrees to it. A clay dragon is not genuine either, but why should it not be apt to affect Heaven? With a burning-glass one draws fire from Heaven. In the fifth month, on a [bingwu] day at noon, they melt five stones, and cast an instrument with which they obtain fire. Now, without further ceremony, they also take the crooked hooks on swords and blades, rub them, hold them up towards the sun, and likewise affect Heaven. If a clay dragon cannot be compared with a burning-glass, it can at least be placed on a level with those crooked hooks on swords and blades. (47, tr. Forke 1911: 350-351) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
A third ''Lunheng'' chapter, which mentions casting burning-mirrors on the fifth month but not the ''bingwu'' day, criticizes the Han philosopher [[Dong Zhongshu]]'s belief that clay dragons could cause rain.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]ven Heaven may be induced to respond, by tricks. In order to stir up the heavenly fluid, the spirit should be used, but people will employ burning glasses [陽燧], to attract the fire from the sky. By melting five stones and moulding an instrument in the fifth month, in the height of summer, one may obtain fire. But now people merely take knives and swords or crooked blades of common copper, and, by rubbing them and holding them up against the sun, they likewise get fire. As by burning glasses, knives, swords, and blades one may obtain fire from the sun, so even ordinary men, being neither Worthies nor Sages, can influence the fluid of Heaven, as Tung Chung Shu was convinced that by a clay dragon he could attract the clouds and rain, and he had still some reason for this belief. If even those who in this manner conform to the working of Heaven, cannot be termed Worthies, how much less have those a claim to this name who barely win people’s hearts? (80, tr. Forke 1911: 132) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The other ''Lunheng'' reference to moon-mirrors mentions moon mythology about the [[moon rabbit]] and [[Jin Chan|three-legged toad]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we hold up a moon-mirror [方諸] towards the moon, water comes down. The moon approaching the Hyades or leaving the constellation of the ‘House’ from the north, it nearly always inevitably rains. The animals in the moon are the hare and the toad. Their counterparts on earth are snails and corn-weevils. When the moon is eclipsed in the sky, snails and corn-weevils decrease on earth, which proves that they are of the same kind. When it rains without ceasing, one attacks all that belongs to the Yin. To obtain a result one ought to hunt and kill hares and toads, and smash snails and corn-weevils. (46, tr. Forke 1911: 341) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two chapters mention ''yangsui'' mirrors to express skepticism about the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese myth]] that the archer [[Houyi]] shot down nine of the [[Houyi#The Time of the Ten Suns|Ten Suns]] (children of [[Di Jun]] and [[Xihe (deity)|Xihe]]) that were burning up earth.
&lt;blockquote&gt;We see that with a sun-glass fire [陽遂] is drawn from heaven, the sun being a big fire. Since on earth fire is one fluid, and the earth has not ten fires, how can heaven possess ten suns? Perhaps the so called ten suns are some other things, whose light and shape resembles that of the sun. They are staying in the ‘Hot Water Abyss’, and always climb up Fu-sang. Yü and Yi saw them, and described them as ten suns. (32, tr. Forke 1911: 272-273) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
These legendary references are to [[Fusang]], [[Yu the Great|Yu]], and [[Yi (husbandman)|Yi]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sun is fire: in the sky it is the sun, and on earth it is fire. How shall we prove it? A burning glass [陽遂] being held up towards the sun, fire comes down from heaven. Consequently fire is the solar fluid. The sun is connected with the cycle of ten, but fire is not. How is it that there are ten suns and twelve constellations? The suns are combined with these constellations, therefore [''jia''] is joined to [''zi'']. But what are the so called ten suns? Are there ten real suns, or is there only one with ten different names? (74, tr. Forke 1911: 412) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Jia'' 甲 and ''zi'' 子 are the first signs of the [[heavenly stems]] and [[earthly branches]] in the [[Chinese calendar]].

===Baopuzi===
Three "Inner Chapters" of the (c. 320 CE) ''[[Baopuzi]]'', written by the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] scholar [[Ge Hong]], provide information about ''yangsui'' 陽燧 "burning-mirrors" and ''fangzhu'' 方諸 "dew-mirrors".

In Chapter 3 "Rejoinder to Popular Conceptions", Ge Hong mentions the commonly used sun and moon mirrors to answer an interlocutor who criticizes Daoist alchemical recipes for immortality as "specious … unreliable fabrications of wondermongers".
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to your argument, they would appear inefficacious, but even the most minor of them is not without effect. I have frequently seen people obtain water from the moon at night by means of a speculum, and fire from the sun in the morning by used of a burning-mirror [餘數見人以方諸求水於夕月陽燧引火於朝日]. I have seen people conceal themselves to the point of complete disappearance, or change their appearance so that they no longer seem human. I have seen them knot a kerchief, throw it to the ground, and produce a hopping hare. I have seen them sew together a red belt and thereby produce a wriggling snake. I have seen people make melons and fruit ripen in an instant, or dragons and fish come and go in a basin. All of these things occurred just as it was said they would. (tr. Ware 1966: 62-3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 4 "Gold and Cinnabar" refers to the ''yinyang'' mirrors in two contexts. The first describes an alchemical elixir method that uses a burning-mirror to create a mercury alloy dew-mirror.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is also a [''Minshan danfa'' 岷山丹法], found in a cave by [Zhang Kaita 張蓋蹋] as he was giving careful thought to such matters on Mount Min. This method forges yellow copper alloy to make a speculum for gathering water from the moon [其法鼓冶黃銅以作方諸]. It is then covered with mercury and its interior heated with solar essence (gathered by a burning-mirror) [以承取月中水以水銀覆之]. The taking of this substance over a long period will produce immortality. This same text also teaches us to place this elixir in a copper mirror coated with realgar, cover it with mercury, and expose it to the sun for twenty days, after which it is uncovered and treated. When taken in the form of pills the size of grams, washed down with the first water drawn from the well at dawn, for a hundred days, it makes the blind see, and by itself cures those who are ill. It will also turn white hair black and regrow teeth. (tr. Ware 1966: 83-84) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second ''fangzhu'' context describes using plates and bowls made from an elixir of immortality in order to collect the ''yè'' 液 "liquid; fluid; juice" (tr. "exudate") of the sun and moon, which also provides immortality.
&lt;blockquote&gt; A recipe for making "black amber sesame" [威喜巨勝] from Potable Gold is to combine Potable Gold with mercury and cook for thirty days. Remove, and fill a clay bowl with it. Seal with Six-One lute [a mixture of alum, arsenolite, salts, limestone, etc.], place in a raging fire, and cook for sixty double-hours, by which time it all turns to elixir. Take a quantity of this the size of a gram and you will immediately become a genie. A spatula of this elixir mixed with one pound of mercury will immediately turn it to silver; a pound placed over a fire, which is then fanned, will turn into a reddish gold termed "vermillion gold" [丹金]. If daggers and sword are smeared with it, they will ward off all other weapons within ten thousand miles. If plates and bowls are made of vermillion gold and used for drinking and eating, they will produce Fullness of Life. If these dishes are used to gather exudate of the sun and moon, as specula are used to gather lunar water [以承日月得液如方諸之得水也], the exudate will produce immortality when drunk. (tr. Ware 1966: 90) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 16 "The Yellow and the White" uses the abbreviations ''zhu'' 諸 and ''sui'' 燧 along with ''fangzhu'' and ''yangsui'' to compare natural and artificial transformations. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is it that the arts of transformation cannot do? May I remind my readers that the human body, which is normally visible, can be made to disappear? Ghosts and gods are normally invisible, but there are ways and means to make them visible. Those capable of operating these methods and prescriptions will be found to abound wherever you go. Water and fire are present in the sky, but they may be brought down with specula and burning-mirrors [水火在天而取之以諸燧]; lead is naturally white, but it can be reddened and mistaken for cinnabar. Cinnabar is naturally red, but it can be whitened to look like lead. Clouds, rain, frost, and snow are all breaths belonging to heaven and earth, but those produced by art differ in no way from the natural phenomena. Flying things and those that creep and crawl have been created in specific shapes, but it would be impossible ever to finish listing the thousands upon thousands of sudden metamorphoses which they can undergo. Man himself is the most highly honored member of creation and the most highly endowed, yet there are just as many instances of men and women changing into cranes, stones, tigers, monkeys, sand, or lizards. The cases of high mountains becoming deep abysses and of profound valleys changing into peaks are metamorphoses on an immense scale. It is clear, therefore, that transformation is something spontaneous in nature. Why should we doubt the possibility of making gold and silver from something different? Compare, if you will, the fire obtained with a burning-mirror and the water which condenses at night on the surface of a metal speculum [譬諸陽燧所得之火方諸所得之水]. Do they differ from ordinary water and fire? (tr. Ware 1966: 262-263) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Baopuzi'' also mentions ''míngjìng'' 明鏡 "bright mirror" magic, such as meditating on paired "sun" and "moon" mirrors to see spiritual beings, using mirror reflections to protect against shapeshifting demons (de Groot 1910: 1000-1005 discusses Chinese demon-conquering mirrors), and practicing Daoist [[multilocation]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At other times a bright mirror nine inches or more in diameter [明鏡徑九寸已上] is used for looking at oneself with something on the mind. After seven days and nights a god or genie will appear, either male, female, old, or young, and a single declaration on its part discloses automatically what is occurring at that moment a thousand miles away. Sometimes two mirrors are used and designated sun and moon respectively. Or four are used and designated as the four circumferences, by which is meant the front, rear, left, and right, to which each points when one looks into them. When four mirrors are used, a large number of gods are seen to appear; sometimes pell-mell, other times riding dragons or tigers and wearing hats and clothes of many colors, different from those seen in ordinary life. There are books and illustrations to document all this. (15, tr. Ware 1966: 255-256) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The spirits in old objects are capable of assuming human shape for the purpose of confusing human vision and constantly putting human beings to a test. It is only when reflected in a mirror that they are unable to alter their true forms. Therefore, in the old days, all processors entering the mountains suspended on their backs a mirror measuring nine inches or more in diameter [明鏡徑九寸已上], so that aged demons would not dare approach them. If any did come to test them, they were to turn and look at them in the mirror. If they were genii or good mountain gods, they would look like human beings when viewed in the mirror. If they were birds, animals, or evil demons, their true forms would appear in the mirror. If such a demon comes toward you, you must walk backward, turning your mirror toward it, in order to drive it away. Then observe it. If it is an aged demon it is sure to have no heels. If it has heels, it is a mountain god. (17, tr. Ware 1966: 281) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The preservation of Mystery-Unity [玄一] consists in imagining yourself as being divided into three persons. Once these three have become visible, you can continue to increase the number to several dozen, all like yourself, who may be concealed or revealed, and all of whom are automatically in possession of secret oral directions. This may be termed a process for multiplying the body. Through this method [Zuo Cu], [Ji Liao], and my uncle [Ge Xuan] could be in several dozen places at one time. When guests were present they could be one host speaking the guests in the house, another host greeting guests beside the stream, and still another host making cases with his fishing line, but the guests were unable to distinguish which was he true one. My teacher used to say that to preserve Unity was to practice jointly Bright Mirror [守一兼修明鏡], and that on becoming successful in the mirror procedure a man would be able to multiply his body to several dozen all with the same dress and facial expression. (18, tr. Ware 1966: 306) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bencao gangmu===
[[Li Shizhen]]'s (1578) ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' classic pharmacopeia mentions both burning-mirrors and dew-mirrors.

''Yangsui'' "burning-mirror" occurs with ''huǒzhū'' 火珠 (lit. "fire pearl/bead") "burning-lens" in the entry for ''àihuǒ'' 艾火 "igniting [[mugwort]] for [[moxibustion]]".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fire used in cauterizing with mugwort ought to be fire really obtained from the sun by means of a sun-mirror [艾火] or fire-pearl (lens?) [火珠] exposed to the sun. Next in efficacy is fire obtained by boring into [''huái'' 槐 "locust tree"] wood, and only in cases of emergency, or when it is difficult to procure such fire, it may be taken from a lamp of pure hempseed oil, or from a wax taper. (火1, tr. Groot 1910 6:947) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Li Shizhen explains (tr. Forke 1911: 497), "[The ''yangsui''] is a fire mirror made of cast copper. Its face is concave. Rubbing it warm and holding it towards the sun, one obtains fire by bringing some artemisia near it. This is what the [''ZhouIi''] says about the comptroller of light receiving the brilliant light from the sun by his fire speculum."

The ''huozhu'' "fire pearl" burning-lens was introduced into China during the [[Tang dynasty]] (Schafer 1963: 237). The (945) ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' records that in 630, envoys from [[Chams]] presented [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r. 626-649) with a crystalline ''huǒzhū'' 火珠 (lit. "fire pearl/bead") "fire orb; [[burning glass]]", the size of a hen's egg, that would concentrate the sun's rays and ignite a piece of punk. The envoys said they obtained this [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tribute gift]] in the country of the ''Luóchà'' 羅剎 "[[rakshasa]] creatures in [[Hindu mythology]]", probably imported into [[India]] from the [[Hellenistic]] Near East (Schafer 1963: 237). Needham and Wang (1962: 115) say ''Luocha'' "the country of the Rakshas", is not [[Sri Lanka]], but rather [[Pahang]], [[Malaysia]]. The (1060) ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' account says the year was 631 and the fire-orb came from [[Bali]]. The American sinologist [[Edward H. Schafer]] (1963: 237, 239) notes that the Chinese ''huozhu'' name reflects the [[Sanskrit]] ''agnimaṇi'' "fire jewel" name for burning-glasses, and later Tang dynasty sources use hybrid names like ''yangsuizhu'' "Solar-Kindling Pearl", showing that the crystal fire-orb was regarded as the legitimate successor of the ancient bronze burning-bowl.

''Fangzhu'' occurs in the ''Bencao Gangmu'' entry  for ''míngshuǐ'' 明水 "bright water" used in rituals (水1 天水類, tr. Forke 1911: 497-498), which is explained as ''fangzhu shui'' 方諸水 "dew-mirror water". [Chen Cangqi 陳藏器] says that it is a ''dabang'' 大蚌 "big oyster[-shell]" that, "when rubbed and held up towards the moon, draws some drops of water from it, resembling dew in the morning". [Other authors say] ''fang'' 方 means ''shi'' 石 "stone", or "a mixture of five stones", and ''zhu'' 諸 means ''zhū'' 珠 "pearl; bead". [Li Shizhen] "rejects all these explanations contending that the [''fangzhu''] was a mirror like the burning speculum, and similarly manufactured. This view is supported by the above quoted passage of the [''Zhouli''], which expressly speaks of a mirror employed to obtain water from the moon. This very pure water was perhaps used at sacrifices."

==Speculum metallurgy==
[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze mirror.jpg|thumb|A ''Jiàn'' 鑒 bronze mirror from the [[Warring States period]] (475 - 221 BCE)]]
[[Bronze mirrors]] have special significance within the [[history of metallurgy in China]]. In the [[archaeology of China]], copper and bronze mirrors first appeared in the (pre-16th century BCE) "early metalwork" period before the [[Shang dynasty]]. Developments of metal plaques and mirrors appear to have been faster in the Northwestern Region where there was more frequent use of metals in the social life. In particular, the (c. 2050-1915 BCE) [[Qijia culture]], mainly in [[Gansu]] and eastern [[Qinghai]], has provided rich finds of copper mirrors (Bai 2013: 157, 164). Archeological evidence shows that ''yangsui'' burning-mirrors were "clearly one of the earliest uses to which mirrors were put, and the art of producing them was doubtless well known in the [Zhou dynasty]" (Todd and Rupert 1935: 14). Chemical analyses of [[Bronze Age#China|Chinese Bronze Age]] mirrors reveal that early technicians produced sophisticated [[speculum metal]], a white, silvery smooth, high-tin bronze alloy that provides extremely reflective surfaces, used for mirrors and reflecting telescopes (Needham and Lu 1974: 198). Among [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], the most common mirror was ''jiàn'' [[wikt:鑒|鑒]] "mirror", which anciently referred to either a circular mirror, often with intricate ornamentation on the back, or a tall, broad dish for water.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The ''[[Kaogongji]]'' "Record Examining Crafts" section of the ''Zhouli'' (above) lists six official standards for ''tóngxī'' 銅錫 copper-tin (Cu-Sn) bronze alloys to produce different implements; from the least tin (1 part per 5 parts copper) for "bells and sacrificial urns" to the most (1 part tin per 1 part copper) for "metallic mirrors", namely, the ''jiànsuì'' 鑒燧 "mirror-igniter" alloy (Hirth 1907: 217-218). However, these ratios are based on [[Numerology#Chinese numerology|Chinese numerology]] instead of practical metallurgy. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Beyond about 32% the alloy becomes excessively brittle, and increasing tin content brings no further advantages of any kind; this the Han metallurgists evidently knew. Indeed they knew much more, for they almost always added up to 9% of lead, a constituent which greatly improved the casting properties. Han specular metal is truly white, reflects without tinning or silvering, resists scratching and corrosion well, and was admirably adapted for the purposes of its makers. (Needham and Wang 1962: 89) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Besides the ''Kaogongji'' half-copper and half-tin formula, other Chinese texts describe the ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' speculum alloy as ''jīnxī'' 金錫 "gold and tin" or  ''qīngtóngxī'' 青銅錫 "bronze and tin" (Forke 1911: 497).

Unless a mirror surface is truly smooth, image quality falls off rapidly with distance. Chinese bronze mirrors included both smooth [[plane mirror]]s and precisely [[curved mirrors]] of bright finish and high reflectivity. Needham and Wang (1962: 91) say, "That high-tin bronze (specular metal) was used from [Zhou] times onward is certain, and that it was sometimes coated with a layer of tin by heating above 2300°C. is highly probable; this would give at least 80% reflectivity." Later the tin was deposited by means of a mercury [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], as recorded in the ''Baopuzi'' (4,  above).

Fu Ju Xiansheng 負局先生 "Master Box-on-his-Back" was the Daoist patron saint of mirror-polishers. The (c. 4th century CE) ''[[Liexian Zhuan]]'' (tr. Giles 1948: 50-51) says Fu Chu "always carried on his back a box of implements for polishing mirrors, and used to frequent the market-towns of Wu in order to exhibit his skill in this work. He charged one cash for polishing a mirror. Having inquired of his host if there were any sick persons in the place, he would produce a drug made up into purple pills and administer these. Those who took them invariably recovered."

The casting of Chinese sun-mirrors and moon-mirrors ideally followed the principles of [[Chinese astrology]], ''yinyang'', and ''[[Wu xing|wuxing]]''. The ''Lunheng'' (above) says ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' mirrors should be smelted from five minerals when a ''bingwu'' (43rd of 60-day cycle) day occurs in the 5th lunar month. The (4th century) ''[[Soushenji]]'' explains, "The fire mirror must be cast in the 5th month on a [''bingwu''] day at noon, the moon mirror in the eleventh month on a [''renzi''] day at midnight." These times, the middle of summer and of winter are in harmony with the theory of the Five Elements (Forke 1911: 497). Many early bronze mirrors have inscriptions mentioning the ''bingwu'' day, which was considered auspicious for casting operations since the cyclical ''bing'' was associated with the west and metal, while ''wu'' was associated with the south and fire; correspondingly, the moon-mirrors were cast on ''renzi'' days in the twelfth month, and these cyclical signs are associated with the complementary elements of water and wood (Needham and Wang 1962: 113).

==Cross-cultural parallels==
[[File:Burning mirrors, from Kircher. Wellcome L0016024.jpg|thumb|Burning mirrors, [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s (1646) ''Ars magna lucis et umbrae'']]
The Chinese use of burning-mirrors has parallels in other civilizations, especially to produce ritual "pure fire", used as the source for lighting other fires.

Burning-mirrors were known to the Greeks and Romans. [[Archimedes]] supposedly set fire to the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] with burning-mirrors in 212 BCE, when [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was besieged by [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] (Simms 1977). [[Plutarch]]'s (c. 1st century CE) ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' account of [[Numa Pompilius]] (r. 715-673 BCE) records the [[Vestal Virgins]] using burning-mirrors to light the [[sacred fire of Vesta]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;If it (the fire) happens by any accident to be put out, … it is not to be lighted again from another fire, but new fire is to be gained by drawing a pure and unpolluted flame from the sunbeams. They kindle it generally with concave vessels of brass, formed by hollowing out an isosceles rectangular triangle, whose lines from the circumference meet in one single point. This being placed against the sun, causes its rays to converge in the centre, which, by reflection, acquiring the force and activity of fire, rarefy the air, and immediately kindle such light and dry matter as they think fit to apply. (tr. Langhorne 1821 1: 195) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The striking contemporaneity of the first burning-mirror references in Chinese and European literature, probably indicates the spread in both directions of a technique originally Mesopotamian or Egyptian (Needham and Wang 1962: 88).

In ancient India, the physician [[Vagbhata]]'s ''Ashtānga hridayasamhitā'' mentions using burning-mirrors twice, to grind certain drugs on it, and to cauterize a rat bite wound (Laufer 1915: 220).

[[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]]'s history of the Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] (r. 1556-1605) records a pair of sacred sun and moon stones: Hindi ''sūryakānta'' "a crystal [[burning lens]] used to light the sacred fire" and ''chandrakānta'' (Sanskrit ''candrakānta'' "beloved by the moon") "a [[Moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]] that drips water when exposed to moonlight".
&lt;blockquote&gt;At noon of the day, when the sun enters the nineteenth degree of Aries, the whole world being then surrounded by its light, they expose to the rays of the sun a round piece of a white and shining stone, called in Hindi ''sūryakānta''. A piece of cotton is then held near it, which catches fire from the heat of the stone. This celestial fire is committed to the care of proper persons. …There is also a shining white stone, called ''chandrakānt'', which, upon being exposed to the beams of the moon, drips water. (Laufer 1915: 221-222). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Owing to the similarities of Chinese ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' mirrors with Indian ''sūryakānta'' and ''candrakānta'' stones, Tang (1935) proposes a [[trans-cultural diffusion]] from China to the [[Mughal Empire]].

A '''choropleth map''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] χῶρος ("area/region") + πλῆθος ("multitude")) is a [[thematic map]] in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or [[per-capita income]]. 

Choropleth maps provide an easy way to visualize how a measurement varies across a geographic area or show the level of variability within a region. A [[heat map]] is similar but does not use geographic boundaries.

== Overview ==
The earliest known choropleth map was created in 1826 by [[Charles Dupin|Baron Pierre Charles Dupin]].&lt;ref name = "MF08"&gt;[[Michael Friendly]] (2008). [http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf "Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization"].&lt;/ref&gt; They were first called "''cartes teintées''" (''coloured map'' in French). The term "choroplethe map" was introduced in 1938 by the geographer [[John Kirtland Wright]] in "Problems in Population Mapping".&lt;ref name = "JKW"&gt;[[John Kirtland Wright]] (1938). [https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/5160537/ "Problems in Population Mapping" in "Notes on statistical mapping, with special reference to the mapping of population phenomena"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Choropleth maps are based on statistical data aggregated over previously defined regions (e.g., counties), in contrast to area-class and [[Contour line|isarithmic]] maps, in which region boundaries are defined by data patterns. Thus, where defined regions are important to a discussion, as in an election map divided by electoral regions, choropleths are preferred.

Where real-world patterns may not conform to the regions discussed, issues such as the [[ecological fallacy]] and the [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (MAUP) can lead to major misinterpretations, and other techniques are preferable.&lt;ref&gt;T. Slocum, R. McMaster, F. Kessler, H. Howard (2009). ''Thematic Cartography and Geovisualization'', Third Edn, pages 85–86. Pearson Prentice Hall: Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the size and specificity of the displayed regions depend on the variable being represented. While the use of smaller and more specific regions can decrease the risk of ecological fallacy and MAUP, it can cause the map to appear to be more complicated. Although representing specific data in large regions can be misleading, it can make the map clearer and easier to interpret and remember.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rittschof|first=Kent|date=1998|title=Learning and Remembering from Thematic Maps of Familiar Regions|url=|journal=Educational Technology Research and Development|volume=46|pages=19–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of regions will ultimately depend on the map's intended audience and purpose.

The [[dasymetric map|dasymetric technique]] can be thought of as a compromise approach in many situations. Broadly speaking, choropleths represent two types of data: spatially extensive or spatially intensive. 
* Spatially extensive data are things like populations. The population of the UK might be 65 million, but it would not be accurate to arbitrarily cut the UK into two halves of equal area and say that the population of each half of the UK is 32.5 million. 
* Spatially intensive data are things like rates, densities and proportions, which can be thought of conceptually as field data that is averaged over an area. Though the UK's 60 million inhabitants occupy an area of about 240,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the population density is therefore about 250/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, arbitrary halves of equal area would not both have the same population density.

== Normalization ==
[[Image:Choropleth-density.png|thumb|240px|Normalization:the map on the left uses total population to determine color. This causes larger polygons to appear to be more urbanized than the smaller dense urban areas of [[Boston]], Massachusetts.  The map on the right uses population density. A properly normalized map will show variables independent of the size of the polygons. ]]
Another common error in choropleths is the use of raw data values to represent magnitude rather than normalized values to produce a map of densities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Monmonier]] (1991). ''How to Lie with Maps''. pp. 22–23. University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; This is problematic because the eye naturally integrates over areas of the same color, giving undue prominence to larger polygons of moderate magnitude and minimizing the significance of smaller polygons with high magnitudes. The problem with using data in total counts arises when the polygons are not all the same size (in area or total population), as in the figure at right. Because a single color, representing a single value, is spread over the entire area of the district, large areas will be more dominant in the visual hierarchy than they should be, and are commonly misinterpreted as having larger values than smaller districts with the same color. To solve this issue, one can ''normalize'' the variable by dividing it by the total area, thus deriving ''density'', which is a field. Another solution is to represent total amounts using a [[Thematic map#Proportional symbol|proportional symbol map]].

== Color progression ==
When mapping quantitative data, a specific color progression should be used to depict the data properly.  There are several different types of color progressions used by cartographers.  The following are described in detail in Robinson et al. (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, A.H., Morrison, J.L., Muehrke, P.C., Kimmerling, A.J. &amp; Guptill, S.C. (1995) ''Elements of Cartography.'' (6th Edition), New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
[[File:Color progression examples single hue.svg|thumb|Single hue progression]]

Single-hue progressions fade from a dark shade of the chosen color to a very light or white shade of relatively the same hue. This is a common method used to map magnitude. The darkest hue represents the greatest number in the data set and the lightest shade representing the least number.

Two variables may be shown through the use of two overprinted single color scales. The hues typically used are from red to white for the first data set and blue to white for the second, they are then overprinted to produce varying hues. These type of maps show the magnitude of the values in relation to each other.

[[File:Color progression examples bi-polar.svg|thumb|Bi-polar color progression]]

Bi-polar progressions are normally used with two opposite hues to show a change in value from negative to positive or on either side of some either central tendency, such as the mean of the variable being mapped or other significant value like [[room temperature]]. For example, a typical progression when mapping temperatures is from dark blue (for cold) to dark red (for hot) with white in the middle. When one extreme can be considered better than the other (as in this map of life expectancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/what-digital-maps-can-tell-us-about-the-american-way |title=What Digital Maps Can Tell Us About the American Way |author=Patricia Cohen |publisher=New York Times |date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) then it is common to denote the poor alternative with shades of red, and the good alternative with green.

Complementary hue progressions are a type of bi-polar progression. This can be done with any of the complementary colors and will fade from each of the darker end point hues into a gray shade representing the middle. An example would be using blue and yellow as the two end points.

[[File:Color progression examples blended hue.svg|thumb|Blended hue color progression]]

Blended hue progressions use related hues to blend together the two end point hues. This type of color progression is typically used to show elevation changes. For example, from yellow through orange to brown.

[[File:Color progression examples partial spectral.svg|thumb|Partial spectral color progression]]

Partial spectral hue progressions are used to map mixtures of two distinct sets of data. This type of hue progression will blend two adjacent opponent hues and show the magnitude of the mixing data classes. &lt;!-- When the two colors chosen match the solar spectrum that shows the greatest magnitude. --&gt;
	
[[File:Color progression examples full-spectral.svg|thumb|Full-spectral color progression]]

Full spectral progression contains hues from blue through red. This is common on relief maps and modern weather maps.  This type of progression is not recommended under other circumstances because certain color connotations can confuse the map user.

[[File:Color progression examples value progression.svg|thumb|Value progression]]

Value progression maps are monochromatic. Although any color may be used, the archetype is from black to white with intervening shades of gray that represent magnitude. According to Robinson ''et al.'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;Robinson et al. (1995), op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; this is the best way to portray a magnitude message to the map audience. It is clearly understood by the user and easy to produce in print.

===Usability===
When using any of these methods, there are two important principles: first is that darker colors are perceived as being higher in magnitude; second is that, while there are millions of color variations, the human eye is limited as to how many colors it can easily distinguish. Generally, five to seven color categories are recommended. The map user should be able to easily identify the implied magnitude of the hue and to match it with the legend.

Additional considerations include [[color blindness]] and various reproduction techniques. For example, the red–green bi-polar progression described in the section above is likely to cause problems for [[Dichromacy|dichromats]]. A related issue is that color scales which rely primarily on [[hue]] with insufficient variation in [[HSL and HSV|saturation or intensity]] may be compromised if reproduced in black and white. Conversely, if a map is legible in black and white, then a prospective user's perception of color is irrelevant.

Color can greatly enhance the communication between the cartographer and their audience, but poor color choice can result in a map that is neither effective nor appealing to the map user. Sometimes simpler is better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Light |year=2004 |title=The End of the Rainbow?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14487">In [[psychology]], the human mind is considered to be a '''cognitive miser''' due to the tendency of people to think and [[problem solving|solve problems]] in simpler and less effortful ways rather than in more sophisticated and more effortful ways, regardless of intelligence.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stanovich |first=Keith E. |authorlink=Keith Stanovich |date=2009 |chapter=The cognitive miser: ways to avoid thinking |title=What intelligence tests miss: the psychology of rational thought |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SQvleDwn9YC&amp;pg=PA70 70–85] |isbn=9780300123852 |oclc=216936066 |ref=harv}} See also other chapters in the same book: "Framing and the cognitive miser" (chapter 7); "A different pitfall of the cognitive miser: thinking a lot, but losing" (chapter 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Just as a [[miser]] seeks to avoid spending money, the human mind often seeks to avoid spending computational effort. The cognitive miser theory is an umbrella theory of [[cognition]] that brings together previous research on [[heuristic]]s and [[attributional bias]]es to explain how and why people are cognitive misers.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fiske |first1=Susan T. |authorlink1=Susan Fiske |last2=Taylor |first2=Shelley E. |authorlink2=Shelley Taylor |year=1991 |origyear=1984 |title=Social cognition |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=0070211914 |oclc=22810253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ToplakWestStanovich2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Toplak |first1=Maggie E. |last2=West |first2=Richard F. |last3=Stanovich |first3=Keith E. |authorlink3=Keith Stanovich |date=April 2014 |title=Assessing miserly information processing: an expansion of the Cognitive Reflection Test |journal=Thinking &amp; Reasoning |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=147–168 |doi=10.1080/13546783.2013.844729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cognitive miser'' was first introduced by [[Susan Fiske]] and [[Shelley Taylor]] in 1984. It is an important concept in [[social cognition]] theory and has been influential in other social sciences including but not exclusive to economics and political science.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt;

==Background==

===The naïve scientist and attribution theory===
Before Fiske and Taylor's cognitive miser theory, the predominant model of social cognition was the naïve scientist. First proposed in 1958 by [[Fritz Heider]] in ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations,'' this theory holds that humans think and act with dispassionate [[rationality]] whilst engaging in detailed and nuanced thought processes for both complex and routine actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heider |first=Fritz |authorlink=Fritz Heider |year=1958 |title=The psychology of interpersonal relations |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=0898592828 |oclc=225326}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, humans were thought to think like scientists, albeit naïve ones, measuring and analyzing the world around them. Applying this framework to human thought processes, naïve scientists seek the consistency and stability that comes from a coherent view of the world and need for environmental control.&lt;ref name="CrispTurner2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crisp |first1=Richard J. |last2=Turner |first2=Rhiannon N. |year=2014 |title=Essential social psychology |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=9781446270769 |oclc=873005953}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}}

In order to meet these needs, naïve scientists make [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]s.&lt;ref name="KassinFein&amp;Markus2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kassin |first1=Saul |authorlink1=Saul Kassin |last2=Fein |first2=Steven |authorlink2=Steven Fein |last3=Markus |first3=Hazel Rose |authorlink3=Hazel Rose Markus |date=2016 |title=Social psychology |edition=10th |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |isbn=9781305580220 |oclc=952391832}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}} Thus, attribution theory emerged from the study of the ways in which individuals assess causal relationships and mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Lee |authorlink=Lee Ross |year=1977 |chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: distortions in the attribution process |editor-first=Leonard |editor-last=Berkowitz |title=Advances in experimental social psychology |volume=10 |pages=173–220 |location=New York |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=012015210X |oclc=1283539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the study of causal attributions, led by [[Harold Kelley]] and [[Bernard Weiner]] amongst others, social psychologists began to observe that subjects regularly demonstrate several attributional biases including but not limited to the [[fundamental attribution error]].&lt;ref name="JonesHarris67"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Edward E. |last2=Harris |first2=Victor A. |year=1967 |title=The attribution of attitudes |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(67)90034-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of attributions had two effects: it created further interest in testing the naive scientist and opened up a new wave of [[social psychology]] research that questioned its explanatory power. This second effect helped to lay the foundation for Fiske and Taylor's cognitive miser.&lt;ref name="CrispTurner2014"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}}

==The cognitive miser theory==
The wave of research on attributional biases done by Kahneman, Tversky and others effectively ended the dominance of Heider's naïve scientist within social psychology.&lt;ref name="BaroneMadduxSnyder1997"/&gt; Fiske and Taylor, building upon the prevalence of heuristics in human cognition, offered their theory of the cognitive miser. It is, in many ways, a unifying theory which suggests that humans engage in economically prudent thought processes, instead of acting like scientists who rationally weigh costs and benefits, test hypothesis, and update expectations based upon the results of the experiments that are our everyday actions.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt; In other words, humans are more inclined to act as cognitive misers using mental short cuts to make assessments and decisions, about issues and ideas about which they know very little as well as issues of great salience. Fiske and Taylor argue that acting as cognitive misers is rational due to the sheer volume and intensity of information and stimuli humans intake&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nano&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheufele |first=Dietram A. |last2=Lewenstein |first2=Bruce V. |title=The public and nanotechnology: how citizens make sense of emerging technologies |journal=Journal of Nanoparticle Research |date=17 May 2005 |volume=7 |pages=659–667 [660] |doi=10.1007/s11051-005-7526-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other psychologists also argue that the cognitively miserly tendency of humans is a primary reason why "humans are often less than rational".&lt;ref name="ToplakWestStanovich2014"/&gt;

===Implications===
The implications of this theory raise important questions about both [[cognition]] and [[human behavior]]. In addition to streamlining cognition in complicated, analytical tasks, cognitive misers are also at work when dealing with unfamiliar issues as well as issues of great importance.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nano/&gt; Voting behavior in democracies are an arena in which the cognitive miser is at work. Acting as a cognitive miser should lead those with expertise in an area to more efficient information processing and streamlined decision making.&lt;ref name=LauRedlawsk2001&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lau |first=Richard R. |author2=David P. Redlawsk |title=Advantages and disadvantages of cognitive heuristics in political decision making |journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]] |date=4 Oct 2001 |volume=45 |pages=951–971 |jstor=2669334 |doi=10.2307/2669334}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Lau and Redlawsk note, acting as cognitive miser who employs heuristics can have very different results for high-information and [[low-information voter]]s. They write, "...cognitive heuristics are at times employed by almost all voters, and that they are particularly likely to be used when the choice situation facing voters is complex... heuristic use generally increases the probability of a correct vote by political experts but decreases the probability of a correct vote by novices."&lt;ref name="LauRedlawsk2001"/&gt; In democracies, where no vote is weighted more or less because of the expertise behind its casting, low-information voters, acting as cognitive misers, can have broad and potentially deleterious choices for a society.&lt;ref name="LauRedlawsk2001"/&gt;

==Updates and later research==
Later models suggest that the cognitive miser and the naïve scientist create two poles of social cognition that are too monolithic. Instead, Fiske, Taylor, and [[Arie W. Kruglanski]] and other social psychologists offer an alternative explanation of social cognition: the [[motivated tactician]].&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt; According to this theory, people employ either shortcuts or thoughtful analysis based upon the context and salience of a particular issue. In other words, this theory suggests that humans are, in fact, ''both'' naive scientists and cognitive misers.&lt;ref name="CrispTurner2014"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7049">'''Community indicators''' are "measurements that provide information about past and current trends and assist planners and community leaders in making decisions that affect future outcomes". They provide insight into the overall direction of a community: whether it is improving, declining, or staying the same, or is some mix of all three.

In essence, indicators are measurements that reflect the interplay between social, environmental, and economic factors affecting a region’s or community’s [[Quality of life|well-being]]. Community indicators projects typically are conducted by [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organizations]] within a community, although in some cases they are initiated by the public sector.

== History of community indicators ==
Community indicators are a localized response to the perceived invalidity of the traditional predominantly economic indicators, such as GDP, that are used for measuring human progress. This invalidity takes two forms. First, economic indicators account for all money transactions as beneficial for quality of life, whereas some of these can be seen as decidedly negative (e.g., money spent on environmental cleanup of pollution that could have been prevented). Secondly, strictly economic indicators do not count the value of non-monetary activity, such as homemaker and volunteer work and non-cash public assistance, which are decidedly positive for the quality of life of many families (Journal article by David Swain, Danielle Hollar; International Journal of Public Administration, Vol. 26, 2003).

A communities level approach to this apparent invalidity is based on the evidence of a social group whose members reside in a specific locality, share government, and often have a common culture and history. Community indicators are not a new concept; they have been in use since 1910, when the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] initiated the development of local surveys for measuring industrial, educational, recreational, and other factors. The processes used by the Sage Foundation are similar to those that reemerged during the 1990s. But the difference today is the use of indicators to consider the full spectrum of a community’s well-being, not just isolated factors. Nowadays, indicators are used by many constituencies within a [[community]]. After a decade of renewed attention to community indicators, they now represent a valuable mechanism to improve monitoring and evaluation in planning.

Russell Sage Foundation employed “over two thousand local surveys taken on education, recreation, [[public health]], crime, and general social conditions” to assess social conditions. The first survey was conducted in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. (In the late 1990s, Pittsburgh again embraced indicators, with its Sustainable Pittsburgh Goals and Indicators Project.) Many of the surveys used
by the Sage Foundation were conducted by nonprofit organizations, such as [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]] and citizen committees. These surveys yielded social trends indicators and were popular until [[Great Depression|the Great Depression]] and World War II, when economic measures such as the [[gross domestic product]] or [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]] indicators took greater precedence

== Community information systems objectives ==
'''Community information systems''' ('''CIS''') bring together a wide range of community indicators — [[social]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] data and information around objectives:
* Monitoring the health, social well-being and sustainability of communities through the management of Quality of Life indicators;
* Bringing together government performance indicators and community targeted indicators into a single solution;
* Widening the use of data by citizens and public officials to support decision-making, improve policy and target resources;
* Providing a wider local intelligence context to [[key performance indicators]] for government officials;
* Communicating outcome measures to citizens, stimulating public debate and building confidence in progress towards societal goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3945">'''Compartmentalization''' is a subconscious [[defence mechanism|psychological defense mechanism]] used to avoid [[cognitive dissonance]], or the mental discomfort and anxiety caused by a person's having conflicting values, cognitions, emotions, beliefs, etc. within themselves.  

Compartmentalization allows these conflicting ideas to co-exist by inhibiting direct or explicit acknowledgement and interaction between separate compartmentalized self-states.&lt;ref name=Tangney58-61&gt;{{cite book|author=Tangney|editors=Leary, Mark R. Leary and Price, June |title=Handbook of self and identity|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-4625-0305-6|pages=58–61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vafgWfgxUK8C&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Psychoanalytic views==

[[Psychoanalysis]] considers that whereas [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]] separates thoughts from feeling, compartmentalization separates different (incompatible) cognitions from each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy McWilliams]], ''Psychoanalytic Diagnosis'' (2011) p. 135-6&lt;/ref&gt; As a secondary, intellectual defense, it may be linked to [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]].&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, p. 200 and p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; It is also related to the phenomenon of neurotic typing, whereby everything must be classified into mutually exclusive and watertight categories.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otto Kernberg]] has used the term "bridging interventions" for the therapist's attempts to straddle and contain contradictory and compartmentalized components of the patient's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Salman Akhtar, ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vulnerability==

Compartmentalization may lead to hidden [[vulnerabilities]] in those who use it as a major defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Reich et al, ''Handbook of Adult Resilience'' (2012) p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Those suffering from [[borderline personality disorder]] will often divide people into all good versus all bad, to avoid the conflicts removing the compartments would inevitably bring, using [[denial]] or indifference to protect against any indications of contradictory evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Glen O. Gabbard|Gabbard, Glen O.]]|title=Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy|location=London|year= 2010|ISBN=978-1-58562-144-6 |pages=34–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using indifference towards a better viewpoint is a normal and common example of this. It can be caused by someone having used multiple compartment ideals and having been uncomfortable with modifying them, at risk of being found incorrect. This often causes [[Double standard|double-standards]], and [[bias]].{{cn|date=October 2012}}

==Social identity==

Conflicting social identities may be dealt with by compartmentalizing them and dealing with each only in a context-dependent way.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Crisp, ''The Psychology of Social and Cultural Diversity'' (2011)  p. 16 and p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==

In his novel, ''[[The Human Factor (Graham Greene book)|The Human Factor]]'', [[Graham Greene]] has one of his corrupt officials use the rectangular boxes of [[Ben Nicholson]]'s art as a guide to avoiding moral responsibility for bureaucratic decision-making—a way to compartmentalize oneself within one's own separately colored box.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[Doris Lessing]] considered that the essential theme of ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'' was "that we must not divide things off, must not compartmentalise. 'Bound. Free. Good. Bad. Yes. No. Capitalism. Socialism. Sex. Love...'".&lt;ref&gt;Doris Lessing, ''The Golden Notebook'' (1973) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''concept-driven strategy''' is a process for formulating [[strategy]] that draws on the explanation of how humans inquire provided by linguistic pragmatic philosophy. This argues that thinking starts by selecting (explicitly or implicitly) a set of [[concept]]s (frames, patterns, lens, principles, etc.) gained from our past experiences. These are used to reflect on whatever happens, or is done, in the future.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. 1911/1996. Some Problems of Philosophy. University of Nebraska Press Nebraska.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept-driven strategy therefore starts from agreeing and enacting a set of strategic concepts ([[organizing principle]]s) that "works best" for an organisation. For example, a hospital might set its strategy as intending to be Caring, World Class, Local, Evidence Based, and Team Based. A University might set its strategy as intending to be Ranked, Problem Solving, Online, Equis, and Offering Pathways. A commercial corporation might set its strategy as intending to be Innovative, Global, Have Visible Supply Chains, Agile and Market Share Dominant. These strategic concepts make up its ''Statement of Intent'' (or Purpose).

==Background==

Much of the [[strategic management]] literature mutates [[Peter Drucker]]'s call for corporations to start the strategic management process by producing a statement of purpose, mission and objectives. This has been mutated into a call to start with a vision, mission and objectives statement. There is an alternative approach which focuses on the Statement of Purpose or Intent. Drucker's example for this statement for a commercial corporation was to state that the corporation's purpose was to create customers. That is, it was going to use the concept of 'customer creation' to coordinate and organise the cognition or mindset of those that worked for the organisation. This was why the corporation existed. Having one concept is now thought to be insufficient. [[George Armitage Miller]]'s modified [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]] and [[dialectic]] suggests a handful of concepts under tension would be preferable.

The Statement of Purpose, Statement of Intent or concept-driven approach to strategy formulation therefore focuses on setting and enacting a set strategic concepts. If a participatory approach is being used these concepts will be acquired through a process of collaboration with stakeholders. Once agreed the strategic concepts can be used to coordinate activities and act as a set of [[decision making]] criteria. The set of concepts that make up the Statement of Intent is then used to make sense of an unpredictable future across an organisation in a co-ordinated manner.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M. A Pragmatic System of Decision Criteria Systems Research and Behavioral Science 2012 {{DOI|10.1002/sres.2122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.006 | volume=31 | title=The linguistic turn in project conceptualization | year=2013 | journal=International Journal of Project Management | pages=1154–1162 | author=McKenna Allen, Metcalfe Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying philosophy==

Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues that our prior conceptions interpret our perception (sensory inputs). These conceptions are represented by concepts like running, smiling, justice, reasoning and agility. They are patterns of activity, experienced in our past and remembered. They can be named by those with language and so shared.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. 1982. Consequences of Pragmatism. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shields, P. 2005. Classical Pragmatism does not need an Upgrade. Administration &amp; Society 37(4) 504-518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandom, R., B,. 2011. Perspectives On Pragmatism. Havard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haack, S. 2006. Pragmatism: Old and New. Prometheus Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toulmin, S. 1972. Human Understanding: The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts. Princeton University Press, Princeton New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagginni explains pragmatic concepts using the classic example of whether the earth is flat or round.&lt;ref&gt;Baggini, J. 2005. Pragmatism History Of Ideas. BBC Radio 4, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"...if we treat the world as if these concepts do exist then we find we can manipulate the world and make things work much better. The point about this is that you cannot just choose any concept. What is useful is not just on our whim to choose. [A concept is] a better concept for looking at the world because it works much better than others. You don't have to worry, as some British philosophers have thought that if you go down the pragmatic route that you might believe the world is flat because [that fits best with our sensory input]. Ultimately it isn't useful to believe that the world is flat. All sorts of things won't work if you construct your view in that way. These concepts are tools for helping us manipulate the world and some work better than others."|Julian Baggini, (aired 2005) Editor of The Philosophers' Magazine.}}

Another example would be that we can think of the war in Iraqi differently by reflecting off the concepts of oil security, Imperialism, aggressive capitalism, liberation or democracy. 
The concept-driven approach to strategy formulation involves setting and using a set of linguistic pragmatic concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M  Pragmatic inquiry Journal of the Operational Research Society (2008) 59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The steps to formulating a participatory concept-driven strategy are:

# Select who the strategy is for exactly, and what exactly is their problem. 
# Reflect on significant events in the past that have impacted on the organisation (past [[experience]] matters)
# Identify all stakeholders including suppliers, competitors, staff, alliances, government, environmentalist, industry experts, etc. 
# Ask them what concerns they have for the future relevant to your organisation. Use their experiences and expertise from being involved in the industry.  
# Use [[idea networking]] to cluster these stakeholder concern statements into about five clusters
# Name these clusters as strategic concepts (priorities, [[organizing principle]]s). For example, one cluster of statements might be about innovation, another about becoming more international. 
# Reflect on the possible paradoxical consequences of enacting these strategic concepts
# Draft a one-page 'Statement of Intent' which says the organisation intends to become more like the five or so strategic concepts.
# Draft implementation action plans for each strategic concept. These should be both organisational change actions and investment projects, with goals and milestones. 
# Communicate the 'Statement of Intent' and 'Action Plans' to stakeholders as appropriate.
# Get senior staffs' comments, performance measures, selection criteria and decision criteria to reflect the 'Statement of Intent'.
# In the longer term, reflect on the strategic concepts in the Statement of Intent.&lt;ref&gt;Blog on Concept Driven Strategy http://mudmap.wordpress.com/tag/concept-driven-strategy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terminology==
Concept-driven strategy is the name given to a number of similar [[strategic thinking]] approaches.

Generally, the term 'concept-driven' is used to encourage a focus on the 'concepts' being used.&lt;ref&gt;Mareschal, D., P. Quinn, S. Lea. 2010. The Making of Human Concepts. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, M.L.G., B.R. Gaines. 1989. Comparing Conceptual Structures: Consensus, Conflict, Correspondence and Contrast. Knowledge Acquisition 1 341-363.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Concept learning]] or Management Concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Management Concepts Wikibooks http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Management_Concepts_and_Applications/Management&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisations produce a 'statement of intent' with little thought as to the concepts it contains.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G., C.K. Prahalad. 2005. Strategic Intent. Harvard Business Review 83(7/8) 148-161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Saku M., Sillance J.A.A. | year = 2007 | title = Strategic Intent as a Rhetorical Device | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Management | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 406–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it is a short list of concepts, high level objectives, principles, priorities or frames, then concept-driven strategy offers a philosophical basis for these statements.

Some organisations produce a 'strategic principles'&lt;ref&gt;Strategic Principals http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/ Strategic Principals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to Turn a Great Strategic Principle into Great Results http://www.strategydriven.com/2011/06/27/how-to-turn-a-great-strategic-principle-into-great-results/&lt;/ref&gt; statement which again is similar to a statement of intent and the same applies about the concepts approach offering a philosophical basis. The term 'strategic priorities' or 'strategic values' are often used in the same way as strategic principles.

The literature about 'corporate purpose'&lt;ref&gt;Basu, S. 1999. Corporate Purpose: Why it Matters More than Strategy. Garland Publishing, Inc, New York &amp; London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, R., R. 2002. Leading with Purpose. Stanford University Press, California.&lt;/ref&gt; is also similar to that of strategic intent. Sometimes, purpose refers to present actions and intent to future ones. If purpose is expressed as a set of concepts, then the concepts approach again provides some philosophical basis.

There is a connection between '[[systems thinking]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ackoff R | year = 1971 | title = Towards A System Of System Concepts | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 661–671 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.17.11.661}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concept-driven strategy. The Churchman/Ackoff stream of systems thinking was interested in a developing generic system of concepts for thinking about problems. Rather than a generic set of concepts, the concept-driven approach uses whatever concepts stakeholders think work best for the future of their organisation.

There is a military planning approach called 'concept-led'.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of OR and Analysis in Concept-led Long Range Planning http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2535/DSTO-CR-0282.pdf{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the implementation of 'Concept-led and Participative' planning in the development of the Defence Logistics Transformation Plan http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4367990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Headline Experiment a concept-led team effort http://adamdonovan.net/pdf/adam%20defence%20mag.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The military-like leadership seems to have moved the concepts from being drivers to be leaders. There seems to be very little difference otherwise.

In turbulent environments, concepts are thought 'more flexible than objectives' (goals, targets) as they provide why certain actions are preferable. The purpose and intent literature likes to distinguish itself from the objectives literature by saying purpose and intent provide the reasons for (why change), the driver for change. Objectives are where you end up. In complex dynamic situations, there may be many acceptable end points, many of which cannot be anticipated by planners. Arguably the only objective is to survive. How is explained in the statement of intent.

Perhaps strangely, there is a connection between 'metaphor', [[metaphoric criticism]], or [[conceptual metaphor]] and concept-driven strategy. Pragmatic concepts are not images but most concepts relate to metaphors. For example, to say an organisation is like a machine, with cogs, or like an adaptive organism, is to use the concepts of machine and organism to reflect on organisations. Much of what has been written about the usefulness of metaphors in planning applies to concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'strategic frames' is not common given the extensive literature on [[frame analysis]] but frames and pragmatic concepts seem to be very similar. [[Amos Tversky]] defines a frame as a conception of outcomes.

The system of strategic concepts listed in a statement of intent, purpose, principles, frames or conceptual metaphor are [[organizing principle]](s).&lt;ref&gt;Vnuk-Balan, E. 2010. Concept Driven Strategy, American Academy of Management Conference, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, as Karl Weick explains [[sensemaking]] as the process of conceptualising problems, concept-driven strategy might be thought of as a pragmatic means of sensemaking a strategy.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Career==

Since completing her PhD, Cordelia Fine has undertaken research at the School of Philosophy &amp; Bioethics at Monash University, at the Centre for Applied Philosophy &amp; Public Ethics at the Australian National University, and at the Centre for Agency, Values &amp; Ethics (CAVE) at Macquarie University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cel.edu.au/persons/cordelia-fine |title=Who We Are, Prof. Cordelia Fine |last= |first= |date= |website=Centre for Ethical Leadership |publisher= |access-date=2018-01-31 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 2012 to 2016 she was an ARC Future Fellow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arc.gov.au/future-fellowships|title=Future Fellowships, Discovery Program |last= |first= |date= |website=Australian Government, Australian Research Council |publisher= |access-date=2018-01-31 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person126041 |title=Find an Expert, Prof Cordelia Fine |last= |first= |date= |website=The University of Melbourne |publisher= |access-date=2018-01-31 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She was also an Associate Professor in the Melbourne Business School, at the University of Melbourne until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person126041 |title=Find an Expert, Prof Cordelia Fine |last= |first= |date= |website=The University of Melbourne |publisher= |access-date=2018-01-31 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently a Professor in the School of Historical and Philosophical Studies at the University of Melbourne, Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.unimelb.edu.au/shaps/welcome/staff |title=Faculty of Arts, School of Historical and Philosophical Studies, Our Staff |last= |first= |date= |website=The University of Melbourne |publisher= |access-date=2018-01-31 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Fine's first book, ''A Mind of Its Own'', synthesizes a large amount of cognitive research to show that the mind often gives a distorted picture of reality. 

Her second book, ''[[Delusions of Gender]]'', argues that conclusions that science has shown that [[men's and women's brains]] are intrinsically different in ways that explain the gender status quo are premature and often based on flawed methods and unexamined assumptions. She also challenges the common assumption that a gender-egalitarian society means that differences in social outcomes and interests must be due to biology. "With still such different contexts and circumstances for men and women, it's simply not possible to compare the choices they make and draw confident conclusions about the sexes' different inner natures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Irvine|first=Jessica|title=An equal footing still step too far|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/an-equal-footing-still-step-too-far-20110826-1jegl.html|work=[[The Age]] (Melbourne)|accessdate=27 September 2011|date=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fine's approach to gender has been criticised by those who think it [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/thepsychologist/docs/psy1110/15 |title=The Psychologist, November 2010 by The British Psychological Society |publisher=ISSUU |date= |accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Farrelly |first=Elizabeth |authorlink=Elizabeth Farrelly |title=Gender and feminism, a guilt trip |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/gender-and-feminism-a-guilt-trip-20101013-16jyv.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |date=14 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118204411/http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/gender-and-feminism-a-guilt-trip-20101013-16jyv.html |archivedate=18 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for not accounting for what psychiatry terms [[gender identity disorder]]s. However, as Fine pointed out in ''The Psychologist'', the book is concerned with scientific evidence presented as support for the idea that males and females are, on average, 'hardwired' to 'systemise' versus 'empathise', rather than the question of the extent to which core gender identity is 'hardwired'; and that she does not subscribe to a behaviourist or [[social determinist]] view of development, but rather "one in which the developmental path is constructed, step by step, out of the continuous and dynamic interaction between brain, genes and environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cordeliafine.com/Psychologist_Interview.pdf |format=PDF |title=The battle of the sex differences: Interview |publisher=Cordeliafine.com |accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ben Barres]], a Professor of Neurobiology at [[Stanford University]], wrote in a review of the book for ''[[PLOS Biology]]'' that Fine's "analysis of this data should be required reading for every neurobiology student, if not every human being." The neuroscientists Margaret McCarthy and Gregory Ball, have said that Fine presents a one-sided picture of the study of sex differences, and that ''Delusions of Gender'' threatened to "severely hamper" progress in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCarthy | first1 = Margaret M. | last2 = Ball | first2 = Gregory F. | title = Tempests and tales: challenges to the study of sex differences in the brain |journal=Biology of Sex Differences | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | doi = 10.1186/2042-6410-2-4 | pmc = 3108906 | date = 28 April 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1186/2042-6410-2-4 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neuroscientists Geert de Vries and Nancy Forger of the Neuroscience Institute at Georgia State University cite the work of Fine and colleagues in noting that "unsubstantiated claims about the nature and function of neural sex differences continue to be made and such claims may do serious harm".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Vries|first=Geert J.|last2=Forger|first2=Nancy G.|date=1 January 2015|title=Sex differences in the brain: a whole body perspective|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13293-015-0032-z|journal=Biology of Sex Differences|volume=6|pages=15|doi=10.1186/s13293-015-0032-z|issn=2042-6410|pmc=4536872|pmid=26279833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Barnard College sociomedical scientist [[Rebecca Jordan-Young]], Fine has rejected the claim,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-xx-factor/|title=The XX Factor - Commentary Magazine|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=18 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on quotations of her criticisms of popular misrepresentations of science, that she is "anti-sex differences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/06/anti-sex-difference-scientific-rigour-gender-research-feminism|title=We’ve been labelled ‘anti-sex difference’ for demanding greater scientific rigour|last=Fine|first=Cordelia|date=6 April 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=18 April 2017|last2=Jordan-Young|first2=Rebecca|author-link2 =Rebecca Young (journalist)|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fine and Jordan-Young, with other co-authors, have published recommendations and guidelines for improving the quality of scientific investigations of sex/gender differences in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rippon | first1 = Gina | last2 = Fine | first2 = Cordelia | last3 = Jordan-Young | first3 = Rebecca | last4 = Kaiser | first4 = Anelis | author-link1 = Gina Rippon | author-link3 = Rebecca Jordan-Young | author-link4 = Anelis Kaiser | title = Recommendations for sex/gender neuroimaging research: key principles and implications for research design, analysis and interpretation | journal = Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 650 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;13 | publisher = [[Frontiers Media|Frontiers]] | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00650 | pmid = 25221493 | pmc = 4147717 | date = 28 August 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00650 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fine | first1 = Cordelia | last2 = Rippon | first2 = Gina | last3 = Jordan-Young | first3 = Rebecca | last4 = Kaiser | first4 = Anelis | last5 = Joel | first5 = Daphna | author-link2 = Gina Rippon | author-link3 = Rebecca Jordan-Young | author-link4 = Anelis Kaiser | author-link5 = Daphna Joel | title = Letter to the Editor &amp;#124; ''Journal of Neuroscience'' research policy on addressing sex as a biological variable: Comments, clarifications, and elaborations | journal = [[Journal of Neuroscience Research]] | volume = 95 | issue = 7 | pages = 1357&amp;ndash;1359 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1002/jnr.24045 | pmid = 28225166 | date = July 2017 | url = https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24045 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine's third book, ''Testosterone Rex,'' critiques an account of sex differences and their evolutionary, neural and hormonal basis that is prominent in the popular literature, and also often influential in some areas of scientific research. In 2017 it won the prestigious  [[Royal Society Science Books Prize]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/news/2017/09/cordelia-fine-wins-30th-anniversary-royal-society-insight-investment-science-book-prize/|title=Cordelia Fine’s explosive study of gender politics wins 30th anniversary Royal Society Insight Investment Science Book Prize|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cromwell's rule''', named by statistician [[Dennis Lindley]],&lt;ref&gt;Jackman, Simon (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QFqyrNL8yEkC&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bayesian Analysis for the Social Sciences], Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-470-01154-6}} (ebook {{ISBN|978-0-470-68663-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt; states that the use of [[prior probability|prior probabilities]] of 0 ("the event will definitely not occur") or 1 ("the event will definitely occur") should be avoided, except when applied to statements that are logically true or false, such as 2+2 equaling 4 or 5.

The reference is to [[Oliver Cromwell]], who wrote to the General Assembly of the [[Church of Scotland]] on 5 August 1650, including a phrase that has become well known and frequently quoted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches |editor-last=Carlyle |editor-first=Thomas |year=1855 |publisher=Harper |location=New York |volume=1 |page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken.}}

As Lindley puts it, assigning a probability should "leave a little probability for the moon being made of green cheese; it can be as small as 1 in a million, but have it there since otherwise an army of astronauts returning with samples of the said cheese will leave you unmoved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Making Decisions |last=Lindley |first=Dennis |year=1991 |edition=2 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-90808-8 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in assessing the likelihood that tossing a coin will result in either a head or a tail facing upwards, there is a possibility, albeit remote, that the coin will land on its edge and remain in that position.

If the prior probability assigned to a hypothesis is 0 or 1, then, by [[Bayes' theorem]], the [[posterior probability]] (probability of the hypothesis, given the evidence) is forced to be 0 or 1 as well; no evidence, no matter how strong, could have any influence.

A strengthened version of Cromwell's rule, applying also to statements of arithmetic and logic, alters the first rule of probability, or the convexity rule, 0 ≤ Pr(''A'') ≤ 1, to 0 &lt; Pr(''A'') &lt; 1.

== Bayesian divergence (pessimistic) ==
An example of Bayesian divergence of opinion is based on Appendix A of Sharon Bertsch McGrayne's 2011 book.&lt;ref&gt;McGrayne, Sharon Bertsch. (2011). ''The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes' Rule Cracked The Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, &amp; Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy.'' New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|9780300169690}}; [http://www.worldcat.org/title/theory-that-would-not-die-how-bayes-rule-cracked-the-enigma-code-hunted-down-russian-submarines-emerged-triumphant-from-two-centuries-of-controversy/oclc/670481486 OCLC 670481486] {{Google books|_Kx5xVGuLRIC|''The Theory That Would Not Die,'' pages 263-265}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Tim and Susan disagree as to whether a stranger who has two fair coins and one unfair coin (one with heads on both sides) has tossed one of the two fair coins or the unfair one; the stranger has tossed one of his coins three times and it has come up heads each time. 

Tim assumes that the stranger picked the coin randomly – i.e., assumes a [[prior probability|prior probability distribution]] in which each coin had a 1/3 chance of being the one picked. Applying [[Bayesian inference#Probability of a hypothesis|Bayesian inference]], Tim then calculates an 80% probability that the result of three consecutive heads was achieved by using the unfair coin, because each of the fair coins had a 1/8 chance of giving three straight heads, while the unfair coin had an 8/8 chance; out of 24 equally likely possibilities for what could happen, 8 out of the 10 that agree with the observations came from the unfair coin. If more flips are conducted, each further head increases the probability that the coin is the unfair one. If no tail ever appears, this probability converges to 1. But if a tail ever occurs, the probability that the coin is unfair immediately goes to 0 and stays at 0 permanently.

Susan assumes the stranger chose a fair coin (so the prior probability that the tossed coin is the unfair coin is 0). Consequently, Susan calculates the probability that three (or any number of consecutive heads) were tossed with the unfair coin must be 0; if still more heads are thrown, Susan does not change her probability. Tim and Susan's probabilities do not converge as more and more heads are thrown.

== Bayesian convergence (optimistic) ==
An example of Bayesian convergence of opinion is in Nate Silver's 2012 book ''[[The Signal and the Noise|The Signal and the Noise: Why so many predictions fail — but some don't]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silver|first=Nate|title=The Signal and the Noise: Why so many predictions fail -- but some don't|year=2012|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59-420411-1 |pages=258–261}}
&lt;/ref&gt; After stating, "Absolutely nothing useful is realized when one person who holds that there is a 0 (zero) percent probability of something argues against another person who holds that the probability is 100 percent", Silver describes a simulation where three investors start out with initial guesses of 10%, 50% and 90% that the stock market is in a bull market; by the end of the simulation (shown in a graph), "all of the investors conclude they are in a bull market with almost (although not exactly of course) 100 percent certainty."

The term '''Dakshinachara''' ([[Right-Hand Path]]) is a technical term used to refer to [[Tantra|Tantric sects]] that do not engage in [[nastika|heterodox]] practices. In contrast, ''[[Vamachara]]'' ([[Left-Hand Path]]) is  used to describe particular tantric practices that are considered [[nastika|heterodox]] according to usual [[Hindu]] social norms.

==Etymology==
N. N. Bhattacharyya explains the Sanskrit technical term ''[[Ācāra|{{IAST|ācāra}}]]'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The means of spiritual attainment which varies from person to person according to competence.... ''Ācāras'' are generally of seven kinds – Veda, Vaiṣṇava, Śaiva, Dakṣiṇa, Vāma, Siddhāṇta, and Kaula, falling into two broad categories – Dakṣiṇa and Vāma. Interpretations vary regarding the nature and grouping of the ''ācāras''.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharyya (1999) pp. 368-69.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Dakshina|{{IAST|Dakṣiṇa}}]]'' mans "right".&lt;ref&gt;Macdonell, A. A. (1996) p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, the term Dakṣiṇāra is often translated "Right-hand practice".

==Practices==

The ''Brahma Yamala'', a [[Tantras|Tantric text]], says there are three currents of tradition (dakshina, vama, and madhyama) characterized respectively by the predominance of each of the three [[guna]]s (sattva, rajas, and tamas).  According to this text, dakshina is characterized by [[sattva]], and is pure; Madhyama, characterized by [[rajas]], is mixed; and Vama, characterized by [[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]], is impure.  The Tantras of each class follow a particular line of spiritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bagchi, P. C. "Evolution of the Tantras" in: Prabhananda (2000) pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Dakshinachara consists of traditional Hindu practices such as [[asceticism]] and [[meditation]].

'''Delayed gratification''', or '''deferred gratification''', describes the process that the subject undergoes when the subject resists the temptation of an immediate reward in preference for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate   reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later.&lt;ref name = Carducci&gt;{{cite book |last=Carducci |first=Bernardo J. |year=2009 |chapter=Basic Processes of Mischel's Cognitive-Affective Perspective: Delay of Gratification and Conditions of Behavioral Consistency |pages=443–4 |title=The Psychology of Personality: Viewpoints, Research, and Applications |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-1-4051-3635-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay [[gratification]] to a host of other positive outcomes, including [[academic success]], physical health, [[psychological health]], and [[social competence]].

A person's ability to delay gratification relates to other similar skills such as [[patience]], impulse control, [[self-control]] and willpower, all of which are involved in self-regulation. Broadly, self-regulation encompasses a person's capacity to adapt the self as necessary to meet demands of the environment.&lt;ref name="MadduxTangney2010"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Celeste E. |last1=Doerr |first2=Roy F. |last2=Baumeister |year=2011 |chapter=Self-Regulatory Strength and Psychological Adjustment: Implications of the Limited Resource Model of Self-Regulation |chapterurl=https://books.googi did this on purpose because you can do this le.com/books?id=KPxfoCUUolsC&amp;pg=PA71 |pages=71–83 |editor1-first=James E. |editor1-last=Maddux |editor2-first=June Price |editor2-last=Tangney |title=Social Psychological Foundations of Clinical Psychology |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-60623-689-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaying gratification is the reverse of delay discounting, which is "the preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger but delayed rewards" and refers to the "fact that the subjective value of reward decreases with increasing delay to its receipt".&lt;ref name="Anokhin et al 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10519-010-9384-7 |title=Heritability of Delay Discounting in Adolescence: A Longitudinal Twin Study |year=2010 |last1=Anokhin |first1=Andrey P. |last2=Golosheykin |first2=Simon |last3=Grant |first3=Julia D. |last4=Heath |first4=Andrew C. |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=175–83 |pmid=20700643 |pmc=3036802}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorized that the ability to delay rewards is under the control of the [[cognitive-affective personality system]] (CAPS).&lt;ref name = Mischel10&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ethan |last1=Kross |first2=Walter |last2=Mischel |first3=Yichi |last3=Shoda |year=2011 |chapter=Enabling Self-Control |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPxfoCUUolsC&amp;pg=PA375 |pages=375–94 |editor1-first=James E. |editor1-last=Maddux |editor2-first=June Price |editor2-last=Tangney |title=Social Psychological Foundations of Clinical Psychology |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-60623-689-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of psychoanalytic theory, discussed the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego. Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the topic, and found that [[impulsivity]], or a lack of ego-control, has a stronger effect on one's ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable.&lt;ref name = Funder&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.6.1041 |title=The role of ego-control, ego-resiliency, and IQ in delay of gratification in adolescence |year=1989 |last1=Funder |first1=David C. |last2=Block |first2=Jack |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=1041–50 |pmid=2614657}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, environmental and social factors play a role; for example, delay is affected by the self-imposed or external nature of a reward contingency,&lt;ref name = Miller&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.33.5.594 |title=The role of rewards in externally and self-imposed delay of gratification |year=1976 |last1=Miller |first1=Dale T. |last2=Karniol |first2=Rachel |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=594–600}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the degree of task engagement required during the delay,&lt;ref name = Mischel02&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.38.2.313 |title=Strategic attention deployment for delay of gratification in working and waiting situations |year=2002 |last1=Peake |first1=Philip K. |last2=Hebl |first2=Michelle |last3=Mischel |first3=Walter |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=313–26 |pmid=11881765}}&lt;/ref&gt; by early mother-child relationship characteristics,&lt;ref name = Mischel00&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.36.6.767 |title=The role of strategic attention deployment in development of self-regulation: Predicting preschoolers' delay of gratification from mother-toddler interactions |year=2000 |last1=Sethi |first1=Anita |last2=Mischel |first2=Walter |last3=Aber |first3=J.

==Background==

===The cognitive-affective processing system===
One well-supported theory of self-regulation, called the [[Cognitive-affective personality system]] (CAPS), suggests that delaying gratification results from an ability to use "cool" regulatory strategies (i.e., calm, controlled and cognitive strategies) over "hot regulatory strategies (i.e., emotional, impulsive, automatic reactions), when faced with provocation.&lt;ref name = Mischel10 /&gt; In "hot" processing, a person thinks intently about the object causing temptation, and especially about its most appealing elements, and is subsequently less able to resist the immediate reward. The use of cool strategies can translate to more control over behavior. Effective "cool" strategies involve distraction and restructuring the perception of the tempting stimulus to make it seem less appealing. For example, in one study of pre-adolescent boys with behavioral problems, the boys showed a reduction in verbal and physical aggression when they used "cool" strategies, such as looking away or distracting themselves.&lt;ref name= Romer /&gt; The most effective type of distraction seems to be imagining another desirable reward, which takes attention away from the immediate temptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Karasu |first=Sylvia R. |date=March 26, 2012 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-gravity-weight/201203/lead-us-not-temptation-the-neuroscience-behind-the-marshmallow-test |title=Lead Us Not Into Temptation: The Neuroscience Behind the Marshmallow Test |work=Psychology Today |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Stanford marshmallow experiment===

The seminal research on delayed gratification – the now-famous "[[marshmallow experiment]]" – was conducted by [[Walter Mischel]] in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stanford University]]. Mischel and his colleagues were interested in strategies that preschool children used to resist temptation. They presented four-year-olds with a marshmallow and told the children that they had two options: (1) ring a bell at any point to summon the experimenter and eat the marshmallow, or (2) wait until the experimenter returned (about 15 minutes later), and earn two marshmallows. The message was: "small reward now, bigger reward later." Some children broke down and ate the marshmallow, whereas others were able to delay gratification and earn the coveted two marshmallows. In follow-up experiments, Mischel found that children were able to wait longer if they used certain "cool" distraction techniques (covering their eyes, hiding under the desk, singing songs,&lt;ref name = Lehrer&gt;{{cite web |last=Lehrer |first=Jonah |date=May 18, 2009 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_lehrer |title=Don't!: The Secret of Self Control |work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; or imagining pretzels instead of the marshmallow in front of them), or if they changed the way they thought about the marshmallow (focusing on its similarity to a cotton ball, rather than on its gooey, delectable taste).&lt;ref name = Brooks&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=David |date=May 7, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/opinion/07brooks.html |title=Marshmallows and Public Policy |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Linehan&gt;{{cite book |first=Marsha |last=Linehan |title=Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder |year=1993 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-89862-034-4}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The children who waited longer, when re-evaluated as teenagers and adults, demonstrated a striking array of advantages over their peers.

Each of these positive outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward in favor of a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against [[rejection sensitivity]] (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds.&lt;ref name = Carducci /&gt;&lt;ref name = Linehan /&gt; These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.

Forty years after the first marshmallow test studies, neuroimaging data has shed light on the neural correlates of delayed gratification. A team led by B. J. Casey, of [[Cornell University]], recruited 59 of the original participants – who are now in their mid-40s – and gave them a delayed gratification task. Instead of resisting marshmallows, these adults were instructed to suppress responses to images of happy faces, but not to neutral or fearful faces. Those who had been high delayers as pre-schoolers were more successful at controlling their impulses in response to the emotional faces (i.e., not pressing the button in response to happy faces), suggesting that the high delayers continued to show better ability to dampen or resist impulses.&lt;ref name = Casey&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2011PNAS..10814998C |laysummary=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/thinking-cap-delaying-gratification/ |laysource=The New York Times |laydate=September 20, 2011 |title=Behavioral and neural correlates of delay of gratification 40 years later |author1=Casey |first1=B.

The researchers hypothesized that high delayers would be more likely to use "cool" regulation strategies to control their responses, which would manifest as activation of the right [[prefrontal cortex]], whereas low delayers would use "hot" strategies, which would activate the [[ventral striatum]], an area also linked to addiction. Indeed, results showed this differential brain activity.&lt;ref name = Casey/&gt; This mirrors other fMRI research of delayed gratification conducted by Noah Shamosh and Jeremy Gray, of [[Yale University]], demonstrating that individuals who chose larger delayed rewards over smaller immediate rewards (in hypothetical situations) showed greater brain activation in the anterior prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = Phys.org&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02175.x |laysummary=http://phys.org/news140173735.html |laysource=Phys.org |laydate=Sep 9, 2008 |title=Individual Differences in Delay Discounting: Relation to Intelligence, Working Memory, and Anterior Prefrontal Cortex |year=2008 |last1=Shamosh |first1=Noah A. |last2=Deyoung |first2=Colin G. |last3=Green |first3=Adam E. |last4=Reis |first4=Deidre L. |last5=Johnson |first5=Matthew R. |last6=Conway |first6=Andrew R.A. |last7=Engle |first7=Randall W. |last8=Braver |first8=Todd S. |last9=Gray |first9=Jeremy R. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=19 |issue=9 |pages=904–11 |pmid=18947356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting one's ability==

===Neurocognitive factors===
The way that a person frames a situation heavily influences a decision's outcome.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.58.9.697 |title=A perspective on judgment and choice: Mapping bounded rationality |year=2003 |last1=Kahneman |first1=Daniel |journal=American Psychologist |volume=58 |issue=9 |pages=697–720 |pmid=14584987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on "hot" and "cool" strategies suggests that when children cognitively represent what they are waiting for as a real reward by focusing on the reward's arousing, "hot" qualities (taste, smell, sound,feel, etc.) their self-control and delay of gratification decreases, while directing attention to a symbol of the reward by focusing on its abstract, "cool" qualities (shape, color, number, etc.), can enhance self-control and increase the delay. Optimal self-control and the longest delay to gratification can be achieved by directing attention to a competing item, especially the arousing, "hot" qualities of a competing item.&lt;ref name = Lehrer/&gt; For example, delays are increased when thinking about the taste and smell of popcorn while waiting to eat candy. This illustrates an individual's ability to manipulate his/her cognitive representation of external stimuli for goal-directed purposes.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"/&gt;

Delaying gratification is the same as controlling the impulse for immediate gratification, which requires cognitive control. The [[ventral striatum]], located in the [[midbrain]], is the part of the [[limbic system]] that is the reward center&lt;ref name = "pmid19164109"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/jn.90730.2008 |title=Short-Term Temporal Discounting of Reward Value in Human Ventral Striatum |year=2009 |last1=Gregorios-Pippas |first1=L. |last2=Tobler |first2=P.

The prefrontal cortex is also the part of the brain that determines the focus of a person's attention,&lt;ref name="Haines 2006"/&gt; which enables a better framing that facilitates delayed gratification.&lt;ref name= Lehrer/&gt;  During adolescence and early adulthood, the prefrontal cortex develops and matures to become more complicated and connected with the rest of the brain.&lt;ref name = Fair /&gt; Older children and adults find the deferment-of-gratification tasks easier than do young children for this reason.&lt;ref name =Fair/&gt; However, the relative ability to defer gratification remains stable throughout development.&lt;ref name = Lehrer/&gt; Children who can better control impulses grow up to be adults who also have better control.&lt;ref name = Lehrer /&gt; Practicing deferred gratification is quite beneficial to cognitive abilities throughout life.&lt;ref name = Lehrer /&gt;

===Behavioral factors===
Behaviorists focus on the acquisition and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. [[Applied behavior analysis|Behavior analysts]] capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It is important to note that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant.&lt;ref name = Miller /&gt; Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.&lt;ref name = Miller /&gt;

Behavior theorists see delaying gratification as an adaptive skill.&lt;ref name = McComas&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2000.33-359 |title=Designing interventions that include delayed reinforcement: Implications of recent laboratory research |year=2000 |last1=Stromer |first1=R |last2=McComas |first2=J J |last3=Rehfeldt |first3=R A |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=359–71 |pmid=11051582 |pmc=1284263}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions.&lt;ref name = McComas /&gt; For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities.&lt;ref name = McComas /&gt; To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.

Behavioral researchers have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement.&lt;ref name = Begley /&gt; A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for a short amount of time and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued.&lt;ref name = Phys.org /&gt; Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0023-9690(80)90021-1 |title=An experimental analysis of impulsivity and impulse control in humans |year=1980 |last1=Solnick |first1=Jay V. |last2=Kannenberg |first2=Catherine H. |last3=Eckerman |first3=David A. |last4=Waller |first4=Marcus B. |journal=Learning and Motivation |volume=11 |pages=61–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual thresholds for delay====
In a 2011 study, researchers tested to see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended on the amount of money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward.&lt;ref name = Begley /&gt; The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As [[prospect theory]] states, people are heavily loss-averse.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"/&gt; People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"/&gt;

====Duration of time delay====
The duration of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2001.34-101 |title=Temporal discounting: Basic research and the analysis of socially important behavior |year=2001 |last1=Critchfield |first1=T S |last2=Kollins |first2=S H |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=34 |pages=101–22 |pmid=11317983 |issue=1 |pmc=1284292}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 study demonstrated that if a reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, the bulk of the participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.

====Behavioral training====

=====Applications in classroom settings=====
In a Year 3 elementary classroom in South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan was put into place. The study gave limits on the numbers of questions the children could ask, and if they did not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The [[token economy]] for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2011.44-451 |title=Using Differential Reinforcement of Low Rates to Reduce Children's Requests for Teacher Attention |year=2011 |last1=Austin |first1=Jennifer L |last2=Bevan |first2=Deborah |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=451–61 |pmid=21941378 |pmc=3177329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Applications to ADHD=====
Compared to neurotypical children, those with [[ADHD]] generally demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more than by the frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through the implementation of a simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased.&lt;ref name = Binder&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2000.33-233 |title=A procedure to teach self-control to children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |year=2000 |last1=Binder |first1=L M |last2=Dixon |first2=M R |last3=Ghezzi |first3=P M |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=233–7 |pmid=10885530 |pmc=1284241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Neef 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2001.34-397 |title=Assessment of impulsivity and the development of self-control in students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |year=2001 |last1=Neef |first1=N A |last2=Bicard |first2=D F |last3=Endo |first3=S |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=397–408 |pmid=11800181 |pmc=1284336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Neef&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2005.146-02 |title=Behavioral Assessment of Impulsivity: A Comparison of Children with and Without Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder |year=2005 |last1=Neef |first1=Nancy A |last2=Marckel |first2=Julie |last3=Ferreri |first3=Summer J |last4=Bicard |first4=David F |last5=Endo |first5=Sayaka |last6=Aman |first6=Michael G |last7=Miller |first7=Kelly M |last8=Jung |first8=Sunhwa |last9=Nist |first9=Lindsay |last10=Armstrong |first10=N |editor1-last=Lerman |editor1-first=Dorothea |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=38 |pages=23–37 |pmid=15898472 |issue=1 |pmc=1224407|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD.&lt;ref name = "Neef 2001"/&gt; In another study, three children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation of the quality of the reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.&lt;ref name = Neef /&gt;

===Across the lifespan===
At birth, infants are unable to wait for their wants and needs to be met and exhibit a defining lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification.&lt;ref name = Mischel92 /&gt; Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Kumst, S., &amp; Scarf, D. |title=Your wish is my command! The influence of symbolic modelling on preschool children's delay of gratification |journal=PeerJ |year=2015 |volume=3|pages=e774|doi=10.7717/peerj.774|pmid=25737814 |pmc=4338768 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/774/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects of age====
Children under five years old display the least effective strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay.&lt;ref name = Mischel92 /&gt; Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood.&lt;ref name = Casey /&gt; Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01732.x |jstor=40064397 |title=Predicting Cognitive Control from Preschool to Late Adolescence and Young Adulthood |year=2006 |last1=Eigsti |first1=Inge-Marie |last2=Zayas |first2=Vivian |last3=Mischel |first3=Walter |last4=Shoda |first4=Yuichi |last5=Ayduk |first5=Ozlem |last6=Dadlani |first6=Mamta B. |last7=Davidson |first7=Matthew C. |last8=Aber |first8=J.

====Effects of gender====
Throughout 33 studies on gender differences, a small significant effect (r = .06) has been found&lt;ref name = Tobin /&gt; indicating that a base-rate of 10% more females are able to delay rewards than males, which is the typical percentage of difference found between the sexes on measures such as personality or social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.98.1.198 |title=Self-discipline gives girls the edge: Gender in self-discipline, grades, and achievement test scores |year=2006 |last1=Duckworth |first1=Angela Lee |last2=Seligman |first2=Martin E.

Some researchers suggest this gender difference may correspond with a mother's tendency to sacrifice her wants and needs in order to meet those of her child more frequently than a father does.&lt;ref name = Silverman /&gt;

===Clinical factors===

====Contemporary clinical psychology perspectives====
Self-control has been called the "master virtue"&lt;ref name = Baumeister&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00086 |title=Virtue, Personality, and Social Relations: Self-Control as the Moral Muscle |year=1999 |last1=Baumeister |first1=Roy F. |last2=Juola Exline |first2=Julie |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=1165–94 |pmid=10637991}}&lt;/ref&gt; by clinical and social psychologists, suggesting that the ability to delay gratification plays a critical role in a person's overall psychological adjustment. People with better ability to delay gratification report higher wellbeing, self-esteem and openness to experience, as well as more productive ways of responding to anger and other provocations.&lt;ref name = Psychopedia /&gt; Early delay ability has been shown to protect against the development of a variety of emotional vulnerabilities later in life, such as aggression and features of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name = Mischel11 /&gt; Meanwhile, many maladaptive coping skills that characterize mental illness entail a difficulty delaying gratification. The tendency to choose short-term rewards at the expense of longer-term benefits permeates many forms of psychopathology.

A growing body of research suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice.&lt;ref name="Baumeister" /&gt; In other words, self-control abilities are malleable,&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared.&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt; [[Exposure therapy]] is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes.&lt;ref name="Linehan" /&gt; For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.

===== Externalizing disorders =====
[[Externalizing disorders]] (i.e., acting-out disorders) show a clearer link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents,&lt;ref name="Mischel11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1996.tb00816.x |title=Delay of Gratification, Psychopathology, and Personality: Is Low Self-Control Specific to Externaiizing Problems? |year=1996 |last1=Krueger |first1=Robert F. |last2=Caspi |first2=Avshalom |last3=Moffitt |first3=Terrie E. |last4=White |first4=Jennifer |last5=Stouthamer-Loeber |first5=Magda |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=64 |pages=107–29 |pmid=8656312 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults.&lt;ref name="Mischel11" /&gt; In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis.&lt;ref name="Romer" /&gt; A 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for [[IQ]] (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02347.x |title=Delay discounting of reward in ADHD: Application in young children |year=2011 |last1=Wilson |first1=Vanessa B. |last2=Mitchell |first2=Suzanne H. |last3=Musser |first3=Erica D. |last4=Schmitt |first4=Colleen F. |last5=Nigg |first5=Joel T. |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=256–64 |pmid=21083561 |pmc=3059765}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification,&lt;ref name="Phys.org" /&gt; and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.

===== Internalizing disorders =====
Difficulty delaying gratification also plays a role in [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing disorders]] like [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Psychopedia" /&gt; A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. [[Procrastination]], which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barlow |first1=David H. |last2=Durand |first2=V. Mark |year=2011 |title=Abnormal Psychology, An Integrative Approach |edition=6th |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth |isbn=978-1-111-34365-1}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Capacity to Delay Reward Differentiates Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder|year=2014|first=Anthony|last=Pinto|doi= 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.09.007|journal=Biol Psychiatry|volume=75|pages=653–659|issue=8|pmc=3969772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear.&lt;ref name="Rehm"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(77)80150-0 |title=A self-control model of depression |year=1977 |last1=Rehm |first1=Lynn P. |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=787–804}}&lt;/ref&gt; A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate [[self-harm]] (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.04.009 |title=An experimental investigation of emotional willingness and physical pain tolerance in deliberate self-harm: The moderating role of interpersonal distress |year=2011 |last1=Gratz |first1=Kim L. |last2=Hepworth |first2=Claire |last3=Tull |first3=Matthew T. |last4=Paulson |first4=Autumn |last5=Clarke |first5=Sue |last6=Remington |first6=Bob |last7=Lejuez |first7=C.W. |journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry |volume=52 |pages=63–74 |pmid=21220067 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.

====Psychoanalytic drives and impulses====
[[Sigmund Freud]] viewed the struggle to delay gratification as a person's efforts to overcome the instinctive, libidinal drive of the id. According to classic psychoanalytic theory, a person's psyche is composed of the [[id, ego and superego]].&lt;ref name = Barlow /&gt; The id is driven by the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]: it wants physical pleasure, and it wants it now. The ego, operating under the [[reality principle]], serves to moderate the id's desire for instant gratification against the superego, which is guided by a person's internalized sense of morality.&lt;ref name = Barlow /&gt; According to [[psychoanalytic]] theory, a person with difficulty delaying gratification is plagued by intrapsychic conflict – the ego cannot adequately regulate the battle between the id and the superego – and experiences psychological distress, often in the form of anxiety or "neurosis".&lt;ref name = Barlow /&gt;

Other psychoanalytic researchers describe a more nuanced, and less universally positive, view of delayed gratification. [[David C. Funder]] and [[Jack Block]] theorized that a person's tendency to delay, or not delay, gratification is just one element of a broader construct called ego control, defined as a person's ability to modulate or control impulses.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; Ego control "ranges from ego undercontrol at one end to ego overcontrol at the other", according to Funder.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; These tendencies are thought to be relatively stable in each individual, such that someone who tends toward undercontrol will "grab whatever rewards are immediately available even at the cost of long-term gain" and someone who tends toward overcontrol will "delay or even forgo pleasures even when they can be had without cost".&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; By this view, delay of gratification may be adaptive in certain settings, but inappropriate or even costly in other settings.

Funder and Block draw a distinction between the ego-control model, in which delayed gratification is seen as a general tendency to contain motivational impulses (whether or not it is adaptive in a specific instance), and the ego-resiliency model (supported by Mischel's research), in which delayed gratification is seen as a skill that arises only when it is adaptive.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; To tease apart these models, Funder and Block explored the association between ego control, ego resiliency, IQ and delayed gratification in adolescents. The adolescents had the choice between being paid $4 at each of six study sessions or delaying their payment until the last session, in which case they would also earn an addition $4 of "interest". The results supported both models of delayed gratification. The teens' tendency to delay gratification was indeed associated with IQ and with ego resiliency (e.g., higher delayers were rated as more responsible, consistent, likable, sympathetic, generous; less hostile, moody, self-indulgent, rebellious), but was also independently associated with ego control (e.g., higher delayers were rated as "tends toward over-control of needs and impulses" and "favors conservative values in a number of areas").&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; The researchers noted that individual differences in ego control (i.e., overall impulsivity) may play a larger role in delayed gratification when the incentives are larger and more motivating.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt;

Writing in 1998, Funder described delayed gratification as a "mixed bag". He concluded: "Participants who exhibited the most delay were not just 'better' at self-control, but in a sense they seemed unable to avoid it. [...] Delayers are in general smart and well-adjusted, but they also tend to be somewhat overcontrolled and unnecessarily inhibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0903_3 |title=On the Pros and Cons of Delay of Gratification |year=1998 |last1=Funder |first1=David C. |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=211–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental and social factors===

====Who's in control====
Factors affecting one's ability to delay gratification depend on whether the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at the will of the person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.&lt;ref name = Miller /&gt;

====Task engagement====
Engaging in work or an assigned task can generate an effective distraction from a reward and enable a person to wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.&lt;ref name=Mischel02 /&gt;

====Mother–child relationship====
The more positive emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies in order to delay gratification.&lt;ref name = Mischel00 /&gt; This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with social and interpersonal frustrations are similar to those utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown.&lt;ref name = Mischel00 /&gt; A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]], [[self-control]] and emotional competency.&lt;ref name = Rodriguez  /&gt;

====Reliability of gratification====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Marshmallow Graph.png|thumb|Mean wait time for children in unreliable vs. reliable environments]]  --&gt;Researchers have investigated whether the reliability of the reward affects one's ability to delay gratification.&lt;ref name = post /&gt; Reliability of the reward refers to how well the reward received matches what the person was expecting or promised in terms of quality and quantity. For example, researchers told children that they would receive better art supplies if they waited. After the children successfully waited for the reward, better supplies could not be "found" and so they had to use the crayons and stickers that were in poor shape. Comparing these children to ones who received their promised rewards reliably revealed different results on subsequent Marshmallow tests measuring delayed gratification. Children who had learned that the researcher's promise was unreliable quickly succumbed to eating the marshmallow, waiting only an average of three minutes. Conversely, children who had learned that the researcher was reliable were able to wait an average of 12 minutes, with many of them waiting the full 15 minutes for the researcher to return in order to double the reward to two marshmallows.&lt;ref name = post /&gt;

===Genetics and evolution===
Evolutionary theory can argue against the selection of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior.&lt;ref name = vanderBos&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2006.02.008 |title=Evolved to satisfy our immediate needs: Self-control and the rewarding properties of food |year=2006 |last1=van den Bos |first1=Ruud |last2=de Ridder |first2=Denise |journal=Appetite |volume=47 |pages=24–9 |pmid=16678304 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such cost is the basic [[opportunity cost]] associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time that could be used to find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage.&lt;ref name = vanderBos/&gt; There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk.&lt;ref name = Fawcett&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2011.08.015 |title=When is it adaptive to be patient? A general framework for evaluating delayed rewards |year=2012 |last1=Fawcett |first1=Tim W. |last2=McNamara |first2=John M. |last3=Houston |first3=Alasdair I. |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=128–36 |pmid=21920413 |url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/29424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk.&lt;ref name = Fawcett /&gt; These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.&lt;ref name = vanderBos /&gt;

It is likely that there is a strong genetic component to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior.&lt;ref name = Lehrer /&gt; For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.

==Animal studies==

Delayed gratification or deferred gratification is an animal behavior that can be linked to delay discounting, ecological factors, individual fitness, and neurobiological mechanisms. Research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as [[capuchin monkey]]s, [[tamarin]]s, [[marmoset]]s, rats, and pigeons.

===Delay discounting===
When animals are faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the [[hyperbolic discounting|discounting]] of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging.&lt;ref name = Fawcett /&gt; Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting.&lt;ref name = Kalenscher&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.12.016 |title=Decision Making: Don't Risk a Delay |year=2007 |last1=Kalenscher |first1=Tobias |journal=Current Biology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=R58–61 |pmid=17240330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.
To test for this theory, they gave the same test while varying the time between the opportunities to choose a reward. They found that as the interval increased, the number of times that the monkeys chose the more risky reward decreased.&lt;ref name = Kalenscher /&gt; While this occurred in macaque monkeys, the varying interval time did not affect pigeons' choices in another study. This suggests that research looking into varying risk sensitivity of different species is needed.&lt;ref name = Kalenscher /&gt;  When provided a choice between a small, short delay reward, and a large, long delay reward, there is an impulsive preference for the former. Additionally, as the delay time for the small/short and large/long reward increases, there is a shift in preference toward the larger, delayed reward.&lt;ref name = Fawcett /&gt; This evidence only supports hyperbolic discounting, not exponential.

===Ecological factors===
Although predicting reward preference seems simple when using empirical models, there are a number of ecological factors that seem to affect the delayed gratification behavior of animals. In real world situations, "discounting makes sense because of the inherent uncertainty of future payoffs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.10.024 |title=Decision Making: The Virtue of Patience in Primates |year=2005 |last1=Long |first1=Arwen |last2=Platt |first2=Michael |journal=Current Biology |volume=15 |issue=21 |pages=R874–6 |pmid=16271858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study looked at how reward discounting is context specific.&lt;ref name = StevensRosati/&gt; By differing the time and space between small and large rewards, they were able to test how these factors affected the decision making in [[tamarins]] and [[marmosets]]. They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances.

The physiological similarities between humans and other animals, especially primates, have led to more comparative research between the two groups. Future research with animal models then can expand our own understanding of how people make decisions about instant versus delayed gratification in the real world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7525">An '''extraterritorial operation''' in [[international law]] is a [[law enforcement]] or [[military]] [[military operation|operation]] conducted outside the territory or [[jurisdiction]] of the state of the forces in operation, generally within the territory of another sovereign state. Under international law, these activities are generally highly restricted, and it is considered a violation of a [[state (polity)|state]]'s [[sovereignty]] if any other state engages in law enforcement or military operations within another state without gaining that state's consent:{{sfn|Stigall|2013|pp=16-17}}
{{cquote|The first and foremost restriction imposed by international law on a State is that—failing the existence of a permissive rule to the contrary—it may not exercise its power in any form in the territory of another State.|author=[[Permanent Court of International Justice]], 1923&lt;ref name=PCIJ&gt;S.S. Lotus (Fr. v. Turk.), 1927 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 10, ¶ 45 (Sept. 7); quoted in {{harvnb|Stigall|2013|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Law enforcement ==
The policing of [[transnational crime|transnational]] and [[International criminal law|international crime]]s is a challenge to state-based law enforcement agencies, as jurisdiction restricts the direct intervention a state's agencies can legally take in another state's jurisdiction, with even basic law enforcement activities such as arrest and detention "tantamount to abduction" when carried out extraterritorially.{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=18}} These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as [[Interpol]] to encourage co-operation, and placing additional obligations on the state such as ''[[aut dedere aut judicare]]'' ("[[extradition|extradite]] or prosecute") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including [[aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] of [[civil aviation|civilian aircraft]], taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of [[terrorism]], as well as crimes against [[diplomat]]s and other "[[Protection of Diplomats Convention|internationally protected persons]]".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|pp=19-21}}

== Military operations ==
While extraterritorial law enforcement activity is highly restricted and subject to the approval of the 'host' state, traditional interstate military operations assume some degree of extraterritorial operation. As Stigall points out, innate in 'just' war (''[[jus ad bellum]]'') is the expectation that one state may be conducting military activity against, and within the borders, of another state; the [[laws of armed conflict]] "[presuppose] extraterritoriality".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31}} Therefore, "[i]f the circumstances exist for the 
lawful use of force under ''jus ad bellum'', then so long as a state abides by the rules articulated in ''[[Law of war|jus in bello]]'' [the law of war], that state’s extraterritorial actions are considered lawful."{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31}}

=== "Unwilling or unable" ===
Problems with the legitimacy of extraterritorial operations arise, according to Stigall, when one state is conducting military activity against non-state actors in a state "that is not party to the conflict".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31}} Although some commentators suggest that the use of force is permitted in some of these cases, with Deeks' commentary on the 'Unwilling or Unable Test' mentioning sources that recommend that "neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent",{{sfn|Deeks|2012|p=499}} Stigall reminds "that such view is not universal, and textual authority for such cross-border attacks is limited".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31-32}}

=== Humanitarian and human rights law ===
For the [[European Union]], key tenets of its [[human rights law]] jurisdiction are laid down in [[Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), with the convention employed to complement and reinforce the more specific scope of [[international humanitarian law|humanitarian law]].{{sfn|Orakhelashvili|2012|p=2}}{{efn|"This should be enough to dispel the assumption that, wherever human rights treaties such as the ECHR apply extra-territorially in situations of armed conflict and occupation, their effect could be curtailed by the more limited humanitarian law protection."{{sfn|Orakhelashvili|2012|p=2}}}} The application of this to extraterritorial operations has been noted by Ryngaert as mixed, with ''Al-Skeini and others v United Kingdom'' in 2011 attempting "to square ''Bankovic ''[''v. Belgium'''s "sufficient control" model of jurisdiction] with the personal model of jurisdiction",{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}}{{sfn|Holcroft-Emmess|2013}} and ''Al-Jedda v United Kingdom'' "tried to reconcile the ‘ultimate control and authority’ standard... with  the ‘effective operational control’ standard endorsed by the UN’s International Law Commission."{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}} Ryngaert declares each of the two results to be "an awkward hybrid theory".{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}}
&lt;!--"for those who brandish human rights, it is difficult to accept that States may do abroad what they are not allowed to do inside their borders."{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}}--&gt;

'''Free will in theology''' is an important part of the debate on [[free will]] in general. Religions vary greatly in their response to the standard argument against free will and thus might appeal to any number of responses to the [[argument from free will|paradox of free will]], the claim that [[omniscience]] and free will are incompatible.

==Overview==
{{main article|Argument from free will}}
The [[theology|theological]] doctrine of divine foreknowledge is often alleged to be in conflict with free will, particularly in [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] circles: if [[God]] knows exactly what will happen (right down to every choice a person makes), it would seem that the "freedom" of these choices is called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Alston, William P. 1985. "Divine Foreknowledge and Alternative Conceptions of Human Freedom." International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 18:1, 19–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem is related to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] problem of the sea battle: tomorrow either there will or will not be a sea battle. According to the [[Law of excluded middle]], there seems to be two options. If there will be sea battle, then it seems that it was true even yesterday that there would be one. Thus it is ''necessary'' that the sea battle will occur. If there will not be one, then, by similar reasoning, it is necessary that it will not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "De Interpretatione" in ''The Complete Works of Aristotle'', vol. I, ed. Jonathan Barnes. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; That means that the future, whatever it is, is completely fixed by past truths: true propositions about the future (a [[determinism|deterministic]] conclusion is reached: things could not have been any other way).

However, some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp p. 46–7&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo]] in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common defenses==
[[Jewish philosophy]] stresses that free will is a product of the intrinsic human soul, using the word ''neshama'' (from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew root]] ''n.sh.m.'' or .נ.ש.מ meaning "breath"), but the ability to make a free choice is through ''Yechida'' (from Hebrew word "yachid", יחיד, singular), the part of the soul that is united with God,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} the only being that is not hindered by or dependent on cause and effect (thus, freedom of will does not belong to the realm of the physical reality, and inability of natural philosophy to account for it is expected).

In [[Islam]], the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge but with God's ''jabr'' or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia Islam]], Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm Man and His Destiny]&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. All actions committed by man's free will are said to be counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are his/her own and not God's.

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848)''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence,"''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==

===In the Bible===
The biblical ground for free will lies in the [[fall of man|fall]] into sin by [[Adam and Eve]] that occurred in their "willfully chosen" disobedience to God.&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', s.v. "Fall, the."&lt;/ref&gt;

"Freedom” and "free will" can be treated as one because the two terms are commonly used as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, “Determinism and Freedom Philosophy – Its Terminology,” http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwTerminology.html (accessed November 7, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are widespread disagreements in definitions of the two terms.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kane, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', (Oxford, 2005), 10 and Fischer, J., Kane, R., Pereboom, D., &amp; Vargas, M., ''Four Views on Free Will'' (Blackwell, 2007), 128 and R. Eric Barnes, {{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/ebarnes/101/101-freedom-topic.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216033737/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/ebarnes/101/101-freedom-topic.htm |archivedate=2005-02-16 |df= }} (accessed October 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these disagreements, [[Mortimer Adler]] found that a delineation of three kinds of freedom is necessary for clarity on the subject, as follows:

(1) '''Circumstantial freedom''' is "freedom from coercion or restraint" that prevents acting as one wills.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958), 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the Bible, circumstantial freedom was given to the Israelites in [[The Exodus]] from slavery in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. Elwell, Philip Wesley Comfort, eds, ''Tyndale Bible Dictionary'' (Tyndale House, 2001), s.v. “Exodus,” 456.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) '''Natural freedom''' (a.k.a. volitional freedom) is freedom to determine one’s own "decisions or plans." Natural freedom is inherent in all people, in all circumstances, and "''without regard'' to any state of mind or character which they may or may not acquire in the course of their lives."&lt;ref name="Mortimer J. Adler 1958"&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958), 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Bible, paralleling Adler, views all humanity as naturally possessing the "free choice of the will."&lt;ref&gt;Donald K. McKim, ''Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1996). s.v. "free will."&lt;/ref&gt; If  "free will" is taken to mean unconstrained and voluntary choice, the Bible assumes that all people, unregenerate and regenerate, possess it.&lt;ref name="D. Douglas 1962"&gt;J. D. Douglas, ed., ''The New Bible Dictionary'' (Eerdmans, 1962), s.v. "Liberty, Section III. FREE WILL."&lt;/ref&gt; For examples, "free will" is taught in Matthew 23:37 and Revelation 22:17.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Free, revised and expanded by Howard Frederic Vos, ''Archaeology and Bible History'' (Zondervan, 1992.), 83.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2015}}

(3) '''Acquired freedom''' is freedom "to live as [one] ought to live," a freedom that requires a transformation whereby a person acquires a righteous, holy, healthy, etc. "state of mind or character."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958), 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Bible testifies to the need for acquired freedom because no one "is free for obedience and faith till he is freed from sin’s dominion." People possess natural freedom but their “voluntary choices” serve sin until they acquire freedom from "sin’s dominion." The ''New Bible Dictionary'' denotes this acquired freedom for "obedience and faith" as "free will" in a theological sense.&lt;ref name="D. Douglas 1962"/&gt; Therefore, in biblical thinking, an acquired freedom from being "enslaved to sin" is needed "to live up to Jesus' commandments to love God and love neighbor."&lt;ref&gt;Ted Peters, ''Sin: Radical Evil in Soul and Society'' (Eerdmans, 1994), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jesus told his hearers that they needed to be made "free indeed" (John 8:36). "Free indeed [''ontós'']" means "truly free" or "really free," as it is in some translations.&lt;ref&gt;Strong’s ''Greek Dictionary'' translates ''ontós'' as “really” or “truly.” Versions using these translations include ''The Darby Translation'', ''The Bible in Basic English'', ''New Century Version'', ''Young’s Literal Translation'', and ''Good News Translation''.&lt;/ref&gt; Being made “free indeed” means freedom from “bondage to sin.”&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Burge, “Gospel of John,” in ''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: John's Gospel, Hebrews-Revelation'', ed. Craig A. Evans, (David C. Cook, 2005), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This acquired freedom is “freedom to serve the Lord.”&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', s.v. “Freedom.”&lt;/ref&gt; Being "free indeed" (i.e., true freedom) comes by "God’s changing our nature" to free us from being "slaves to sin." and endowing us with "the freedom to choose to be righteous."

Mark R. Talbot,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/T/Mark-Talbot&lt;/ref&gt; a "classical Christian theist,"&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, “Does God Reveal Who He Actually Is?” in ''God Under Fire'', ed. Douglas S. Huffman, Eric L. Johnson (Zondervan, 2002), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; views this acquired [[Compatibilism|"compatibilist]] freedom" as the freedom that "Scripture portrays as worth having."&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, “True Freedom: The Liberty That Scripture Portrays as Worth Having” in ''Beyond the Bounds'', ed. John Piper and others, 105-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Open theism]] denies that classical theism’s [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] "freedom to choose to be righteous without the possibility of choosing otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, "True Freedom: The Liberty That Scripture Portrays as Worth Having" in ''Beyond the Bounds'', ed. John Piper and others, (Crossway, 2003), 107,109.&lt;/ref&gt; qualifies as true freedom. For open theism, true [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian freedom]] is [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist freedom]]. Regardless of factors, a person has the freedom to choose opposite alternatives. In open theist [[William Hasker]]’s words, regarding any action it is always "''within the agent’s power to perform the action and also in the agent’s power to refrain from the action''."&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, “A Philosophical Perspective,” in ''The Openness of God'' (InterVarsity, 1994), 136-137, Hasker’s italics.&lt;/ref&gt; Although open theism generally contradicts classical theism’s "freedom to choose to be righteous without the possibility of choosing otherwise," Hasker allows that Jesus possessed and humans in heaven will possess such a freedom. Regarding Jesus, Hasker views Jesus as “a free agent,” but he also thinks that "it was not really possible" that Jesus would "abort the mission."&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, answer to "Did Jesus have free will?" at {{cite web |url=http://www.opentheism.info/pages/questions/phiq/freewill/freewill_03.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306181014/http://www.opentheism.info/pages/questions/phiq/freewill/freewill_03.php |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }} (accessed September 27, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding heaven, Hasker foresees that as the result of our choice we will be "unable to sin" because all sinful impulses will be gone.&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, answer to "So, will there be free will in heaven?" at

===Roman Catholic===
Theologians of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] universally embrace the idea of free will, but generally do not view free will as existing apart from or in contradiction to [[divine grace|grace]]. According to the Roman Catholic Church "To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore he establishes his eternal plan of "predestination", he includes in it each person's free response to his grace."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church, section 600&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] wrote extensively on free will, with Augustine focusing on the importance of free will in his responses to the [[Manichaeans]], and also on the limitations of a concept of unlimited free will as denial of grace, in his refutations of [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]].

The Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church asserts that "Freedom is the power, rooted in reason and will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1731|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a3.htm|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It goes on to say that "God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. God willed that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him.""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1730|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a3.htm|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The section concludes with the role that grace plays, "By the working of grace the Holy Spirit educates us in spiritual freedom in order to make us free collaborators in his work in the Church and in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1742|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a3.htm|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin Christianity's views on free will and grace are often contrasted with predestination in [[Calvinism|Reformed]] [[Protestant Christianity]], especially after the [[Counter-Reformation]], but in understanding differing conceptions of free will it is just as important to understand the differing conceptions of the nature of God, focusing on the idea that God can be all-powerful and all-knowing even while people continue to exercise free will, because God transcends time.

The papal encyclical on human freedom, ''Libertas Praestantissimum'' by Pope Leo XIII (1888),&lt;ref&gt;Leo XIII, ''[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13liber.htm Libertas Praestantissimum]'', 1888&lt;/ref&gt; seems to leave the question unresolved as to the relation between free will and determinism: whether the correct notion is the compatibilist one or the libertarian one. The quotations supporting compatibilism include the one from St. Thomas (footnote 4) near the end of paragraph 6, regarding the cause of evil ("Whereas, when he sins, he acts in opposition to reason, is moved by another, and is the victim of foreign misapprehensions"),&lt;ref&gt;Likewise in paragraph 5 that the good or the choice of the good comes from the judgement of reason (in Roman Catholic doctrine it is not identical with free will), which is usually considered causal in philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar passus suggesting a natural, cause-and-effect function of human will ("harmony with his natural inclinations", "Creator of will", "by whom all things are moved in conformity with their nature") near the end of paragraph 8 (when considering the problem of how grace can have effects on free will). On the other hand, metaphysical libertarianism &amp;ndash; at least as a sort of possibility of reversing the direction of one's acting &amp;ndash; is suggested by the reference to the well-known philosophical term ''metaphysical freedom'' at the beginning of paragraph 3 and, to an extent, a contrasting comparison of animals, which always act "of necessity", with human liberty, by means of which one can "either act or not act, do this or do that".

Critique that seems more or less to support popular incompatibilistic views can be found in some papal documents especially in the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;See especially e.g. [http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12PSYRE.HTM an address of Pius XII to the Fifth International Congress on Psychotherapy and Clinical Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; no ''explicit'' condemnation, however, of causal determinism in its most generic form can be found there. More often these documents focus on condemnation of physicalism/materialism and the stressing of significance of belief in soul, as a non-physical indivisible substance equipped with intellect and will, which decides human proceeding in a (perhaps imprecise) way.

===Orthodox Christianity===

====Oriental Orthodox====
The concept of free will is also of vital importance in the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental]] (or [[miaphysitism|non-Chalcedonian]]) Churches,  those in communion with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. As in Judaism, free will is regarded as [[axiomatic]]. Everyone is regarded as having a free choice as to in what measure he or she will follow his or her [[conscience]] or [[:wikt:arrogance|arrogance]], these two having been appointed for each individual. The more one follows one's conscience, the more it brings one good results, and the more one follows one's arrogance, the more it brings one bad results. Following only one's arrogance is sometimes likened to the dangers of falling into a pit while walking in pitch darkness, without the light of conscience to illuminate the path. Very similar doctrines have also found written expression in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] "Manual of Discipline", and in some religious texts possessed by the [[Beta Israel]] Jews of [[Ethiopia]].

====Eastern Orthodox====
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] (or [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian]]) [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] espouses a belief different from the Lutheran, Calvinist, and Arminian Protestant views. The difference is in the interpretation of [[original sin]], alternatively known as "[[ancestral sin]]," where the Orthodox do not believe in [[total depravity]]. The Orthodox reject the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] view that the original sin did not damage human nature; they accept that the human nature is depraved, but despite man's fallenness the divine image he bears has not been destroyed.

The Orthodox Church holds to the teaching of synergy (συνεργός, meaning working together), which says that man has the freedom to, and must if he wants to be saved, choose to accept and work with the grace of God. St. [[John Cassian]], a 4th-century Church Father and pupil of St. [[John Chrysostom]], articulated this view and all the Eastern Fathers embraced it. He taught that "Divine grace is necessary to enable a sinner to return unto God and live, yet man must first, of himself, desire and attempt to choose and obey God", and that "Divine grace is indispensable for salvation, but it does not necessarily need to precede a free human choice, because, despite the weakness of human volition, the will can take the initiative toward God.".

Some [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]] use the parable of a drowning man to plainly illustrate the teaching of synergy: God from the ship throws a rope to a drowning man, pulls him up, saving him, and the man, if he wants to be saved, must hold on tightly to the rope; explaining both that salvation is a gift from God and man cannot save himself, and that man must co-work (syn-ergo) with God in the process of salvation.

[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Christian novelist, suggested many arguments for and against free will. Famous arguments are found in "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" chapter in ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', and in his work ''[[Notes from Underground]]''. He also developed an argument that suicide, if irrational, is actually a validation of free will (see Kirilov in the [[The Devils (novel)|Demons]]) novel. As for the argument presented in ''The Brothers Karamazov'''s section "The Rebellion" that the suffering of innocents was not worth the price of free will, Dostoevsky appears to propose the idea of [[apocatastasis]] (or [[universal reconciliation]]) as one possible rational solution.

;Roman Catholic teaching
Illustrating as it does that the human part in salvation (represented by holding on to the rope) must be preceded and accompanied by grace (represented by the casting and drawing of the rope), the image of the drowning man holding on to the rope cast and drawn by his rescuer corresponds closely to Roman Catholic teaching, which holds that God, who "destined us in love to be his sons" and "to be conformed to the image of his Son",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 257] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303003725/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM |date=March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; includes in his eternal plan of "predestination" each person's free response to his grace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1O.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 600]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church holds to the teaching that "by free will, (the human person) is capable of directing himself toward his true good … man is endowed with freedom, an outstanding manifestation of the divine image'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a1.htm CCC 1704-1705]&lt;/ref&gt; Man has free will either to accept or reject the grace of God, so that for salvation "there is a kind of interplay, or [[synergy]], between human freedom and divine grace".&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cymM4xEM76wC&amp;pg=PA766&amp;dq=Catechism+Catholic+Church+synergy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cu4dTLPRE8qHOLbolPEL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Catechism of the Catholic Church, Reader's Guide to Themes (Burns &amp; Oates 1999] {{ISBN|0-86012-366-9}}), p. 766&lt;/ref&gt; "Justification establishes cooperation between God's grace and man's freedom. On man's part it is expressed by the assent of faith to the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in the cooperation of charity with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who precedes and preserves his assent: 'When God touches man's heart through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, man himself is not inactive while receiving that inspiration, since he could reject it; and yet, without God's grace, he cannot by his own free will move himself toward justice in God's sight' (Council of Trent)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm CCC 1993] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623190358/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm |date=June 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows man's free acting through his collaboration.&lt;ref name="vatican1"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P70.HTM CCC 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; For Roman Catholics, therefore, human cooperation with grace is essential.&lt;ref name="ZJlLHLPY8C p. 186"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=i6ZJlLHLPY8C&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=%22holy+spirit%22+%22human+cooperation%22+catholic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=apsdeqjBwe&amp;sig=lUEQnuuiY2rMxLf2_4Yq8fzAezg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E4EpTJ-mCI3y0gSi9NDcAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22holy%20spirit%22%20%22human%20cooperation%22%20catholic&amp;f=false James Patrick, ''Renaissance and Reformation'' (Marshall Cavendish 2007] {{ISBN|978-0-7614-7651-1}}), vol. 1, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; When God establishes his eternal plan of 'predestination', he includes in it each person's free response to his grace, whether it is positive or negative: "In this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place" ({{bibleverse||Acts|4:27-28}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1O.HTM CCC 600)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative comes from God,&lt;ref&gt;We receive the grace of Christ in the Holy Spirit, and without the Holy Spirit no one can have faith in Christ ({{bibleverse|1|Cor.|12:3}}), and as Saint Cyril of Alexandria said: "It is unworkable for the soul of man to achieve any of the goods, namely, to control its own passions and to escape the mightiness of the sharp trap of the devil, unless he is fortified by the grace of the Holy Spirit and on this count he has Christ himself in his soul" (Against Julian, 3)&lt;/ref&gt; but it demands a free response from man: "God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows man's free acting through his collaboration".&lt;ref name="vatican1"/&gt; "Since the initiative belongs to God in the order of grace, no one can merit the initial grace of forgiveness and justification, at the beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity, we can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the attainment of eternal life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P70.HTM CCC 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Orthodox criticism of Roman Catholic theology
Orthodox theologian [[Vladimir Lossky]] has stated that the teaching of [[John Cassian]], who in the East is considered a witness to Tradition, but who "was unable to make himself correctly understood", "was interpreted, on the rational plane, as a semi-pelagianism, and was condemned in the West".&lt;ref&gt;It is not, in the circumstances, surprising that a representative of the Eastern tradition-St. John Cassian-who took part in this debate and was opposed both to the Pelagians and to St Augustine, was not able to make himself correctly understood. His position of seeming to stand 'above' the conflict, was interpreted, on the rational plane, as a semi-pelagianism, and was condemned in the West. The Eastern Church, on the other hand, has always considered him as a witness to tradition.  The mystical theology of the Eastern Church By Vladimir Lossky Publisher: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press; Edition Not Stated edition Language: English {{ISBN|978-0-913836-31-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Where the Roman Catholic Church defends the concept of faith and free will these are questioned in the East by the conclusions of the [[Second Council of Orange]]. This council is not accepted by the Eastern churches and the Roman Catholic Church's use{{Failed verification|date=August 2010|reason = the citation says nothing of an alleged use or even a single instance of the Roman Catholic Church describing "their position" (whose?) and Cassian himself as semi-Pelagian - and Florovsky explicitly says that there wasn't unanimity within the Latin Church}}&lt;ref&gt;Council of Orange local Council, never accepted in the East, 529 AD Convened regarding Pelagianism. Condemned various beliefs of Pelagianism: that humans are unaffected by Adam's sin, that a person's move towards God can begin without grace, that an increase of faith can be attained apart from grace, that salvation can be attained apart from the Holy Spirit, that man's free will can be restored from its destruction apart from baptism, that 'merit' may precede grace, that man can do good and attain salvation without God's help, Statement we must, under the blessing of God, preach and believe as follows. The sin of the first man has so impaired and weakened free will that no one thereafter can either love God as he ought or believe in God or do good for God's sake, unless the grace of divine mercy has preceded him....According to the Roman Catholic faith we also believe that after grace has been received through baptism, all baptized persons have the ability and responsibility, if they desire to labor faithfully, to perform with the aid and cooperation of Christ what is of essential importance in regard to the salvation of their soul. We not only do not believe that any are foreordained to evil by the power of God, but even state with utter abhorrence that if there are those who want to believe so evil a thing, they are anathema. We also believe and confess to our benefit that in every good work it is not we who take the initiative and are then assisted through the mercy of God, but God himself first inspires in us both faith in him and love for him without any previous good works of our own that deserve reward, so that we may both faithfully seek the sacrament of baptism, and after baptism be able by his help to do what is pleasing to him.

The balanced synergistic doctrine of the early and Eastern Church, a doctrine misunderstood and undermined by Latin Christianity in general from St. Augustine on— although there was always opposition to this in the Latin Church— always understood that God initiates, accompanies, and completes everything in the process of salvation.

Although the Roman Catholic Church explicitly teaches that "original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants",&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 405] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904224955/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM |date=September 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some Eastern Orthodox nevertheless claim that Roman Catholicism professes the teaching, which they attribute to Saint Augustine, that everyone bears not only the consequence, but also the guilt of Adam's sin.&lt;ref&gt;So far Roman Catholicism agrees with the Church; it differs with Orthodoxy on the nature of man's fall and the human condition. Following Augustine of Hippo, the Latins teach that Adam and Eve sinned against God. The guilt of their sin has been inherited by every man, woman and child after them. All humanity is liable for their "original sin." WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORTHODOXY AND ROMAN CATHOLICISM? by Father [[Michael Azkoul]] [http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/reading/ortho_cath.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Orthodox, I discovered, objected to the Roman Catholic understanding of original sin as the stain of inherited guilt passed down from Adam, as a result of his sin, to the rest of the human race. The Orthodox saw this notion of original sin as skewed, drawing almost exclusively on the thought of Saint Augustine. He had virtually ignored the teachings of the Eastern Fathers, who tended to see original sin not as inherited guilt but rather as "the ancestral curse" by which human beings were alienated from the divine life and thus became subject to corruption and death.

As I read further, I discovered that Saint Augustine's and consequently, the Roman Catholic Church's view was the result of the faulty Latin translation of Romans 5:12, the New Testament passage on which the teaching of original sin is based. When the original Greek is properly translated it reads, "Therefore, as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and death spread to all in that (eph ho) all sinned.  . ." The Latin which Augustine used rendered the eph ho ("in that") as in
&gt; quo ("in whom"), meaning "in Adam." Thus the passage was misconstrued as saying that all sinned in Adam, that all shared in the guilt of his original disobedience.

It is understandable how the Roman Catholic doctrine of original sin followed from this misinterpretation. It is also easy to see why the Orthodox rejected the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. Because they understood original sin in terms of the ancestral curse of human mortality, they saw Pius IX's dogma as amounting to no less than an assertion of Mary's immortality! That is, by saying that Mary was free from original sin, the Roman Church in effect was saying that Mary was not mortal! She was therefore not like the rest of the human race. This was something no Orthodox Christian could accept. In fact, Orthodoxy calls Mary "the first of the redeemed", the first human to receive the great blessing of salvation now available to all mankind.

===Differences of view between Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches===
Various Roman Catholic theologians identify Cassian as a teacher of the [[Semipelagianism|semipelagian]] heresy which was condemned by the Council of Orange.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dWpO1--eMrYC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+Catholic+History++Cassian&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=87M0TJ2PCIL78Aa_6-WIAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Cassian&amp;f=false OSV's encyclopedia of Roman Catholic history By Matthew Bunson's]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VzAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=cassian+semipelagianism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nyI1TNvKEIaBlAfm2unUBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=An Introduction to the Early History of Christian Doctrine: To the Time of ... - James Franklin Bethune-Baker - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;Yet Cassian did not himself escape the suspicion of erroneous teaching; he is in fact regarded as the originator of what, since the Middle Ages, has been known as Semipelagianism.

Recently, some Roman Catholic theologians have argued that Cassian's writings should not be considered semipelagian.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} And scholars of other denominations too have concluded that Cassian's thought "is not Semi-Pelagian",&lt;ref name=Pristas&gt;[http://escholarship.bc.edu/dissertations/AAI9329276/ Lauren Pristas, ''The Theological Anthropology of John Cassian'']&lt;/ref&gt; and that he instead taught that "salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God's grace"&lt;ref name=Pristas/&gt; and held that "God's grace, not human free will, is responsible for 'everything which pertains to salvation' - even faith."&lt;ref name=Casiday-faith&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fC0tYhHDHbEC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=cassian+baldly+asserts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OFvglZnBsV&amp;sig=NArSD9TzmzlWaaGNmWXDFF6CM3I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XQxATKKRHJr40wSO4NyZDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cassian%20baldly%20asserts&amp;f=false Augustine Casiday, ''Tradition and Theology in St John Cassian'' (Oxford University Press 2007] {{ISBN|0-19-929718-5}}), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orthodox Church holds to the teaching of [[synergy]] (συνεργός, meaning working together), which says that man has the freedom to, and must if he wants to be saved, choose to accept and work with the grace of God. Once baptised the experience of his salvation and relationship with God is called [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]. Mankind has free will to accept or reject the grace of God. Rejection of the gifts of God is called blasphemy of the Holy Spirit (gifts of grace, faith, life).&lt;ref&gt;We receive the grace of Christ in the Holy Spirit, and without the Holy Spirit no one can have faith in Christ (I Cor. 12:3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril of Alexandria: "For it is unworkable for the soul of man to achieve any of the goods, namely, to control its own passions and to escape the mightiness of the sharp trap of the devil, unless he is fortified by the grace of the Holy Spirit and on this count he has Christ himself in his soul." (Against Julian, 3)&lt;/ref&gt; The first who defined this teaching was [[John Cassian]], 4th-century Church Father, and a pupil of [[John Chrysostom]], and all Eastern Fathers accept it. He taught that "Divine grace is necessary to enable a sinner to return unto God and live, yet man must first, of himself, desire and attempt to choose and obey God", and that "Divine grace is indispensable for salvation, but it does not necessarily need to precede a free human choice, because, despite the weakness of human volition, the will can take the initiative toward God.".{{Citation needed|date=July 2010|reason = Are these 20th-century-sounding quotations really Cassian's words or only something taken from the Elwell Evangelical Dictionary? They seem to go far beyond what I have so far found in the much-cited conference of John Cassian.  Did I miss them?}}

Some Orthodox use an example of a drowning man to illustrate the teaching of synergy: God from the ship throws a rope to a drowning man, the man may take the rope if he wants to be saved, but he may decide not to take the rope and perish by his own will. Explaining both that salvation is a gift from God and man cannot save himself. That man must co-work (syn-ergo) with God in the process of salvation.

====Arminianism====
{{Main article|History of Calvinist–Arminian debate}}

Christians who were influenced by the teachings of [[Jacobus Arminius]] (such as [[Methodists]]) believe that while God is all-knowing and always knows what choices each person will make, and he still gives them the ability to choose or not choose everything, regardless of whether there are any internal or external factors contributing to that choice. 

Like [[John Calvin]], Arminius affirmed [[total depravity]], but Arminius believed that only [[prevenient grace]] allowed people to choose salvation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Concerning grace and free will, this is what I teach according to the Scriptures and orthodox consent: Free will is unable to begin or to perfect any true and spiritual good, without grace....  This grace [''prœvenit''] goes before, accompanies, and follows; it excites, assists, operates that we will, and co operates lest we will in vain.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobus Arminius, ''The Works of James Arminius, D.D., Formerly Professor of Divinity in the University of Leyden'' (Auburn, NY: Derby and Miller, 1853), 4:472.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prevenient grace is [[divine grace]] which precedes human decision. It exists prior to and without reference to anything humans may have done. As humans are corrupted by the effects of [[sin]], prevenient grace allows persons to engage their God-given [[free will]] to choose the salvation offered by God in Jesus Christ or to reject that salvific offer.

[[Thomas Jay Oord]] offers perhaps the most cogent free will theology presupposing prevenient grace. What he calls "essential kenosis" says God acts preveniently to give freedom/agency to all creatures. This gift comes from God's eternal essence, and is therefore necessary. God remains free in choosing how to love, but the fact that God loves and therefore gives freedom/agency to others is a necessary part of what it means to be divine.

This view is backed in the Bible with verses such as [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke13:34&amp;version=NKJV Luke 13:34], NKJV
&lt;blockquote&gt;
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were not willing!” 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here we see Jesus lamenting that He is unable to save [[Jerusalem]] as they are not willing. We see that whilst Jesus wants to save Jerusalem He respects their choice to continue on in sin despite His will that they be saved.

====Lutheranism====
{{main article|Lutheranism}}
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%202:14;&amp;version=50; 1 Cor. 2:14], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%2012:3;&amp;version=31; 12:3], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.%208:7;&amp;version=31; Rom. 8:7], [[Martin Chemnitz]], [[Examination of the Council of Trent]]: Vol. I. Trans. Fred Kramer,  St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1971, pp. 409-53, "Seventh Topic, Concerning Free Will: From the Decree of the Sixth Session of the Council of Trent".&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans believe that although humans have free will concerning civil righteousness, they cannot work spiritual righteousness without the Holy Spirit, since righteousness in the heart cannot be wrought in the absence of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.html#article18 Augsburg Confession, Article 18, Of Free Will].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, humanity is free to choose and act in every regard except for the choice of salvation.

Lutherans also teach that sinners, while capable of doing works that are outwardly "good," are [[Incurvatus in se|not capable]] of doing works that satisfy God's justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7:18 Rom. 7:18], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:7;&amp;version=9; 8:7] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%202:14;&amp;version=31; 1 Cor. 2:14], [[Martin Chemnitz]], Examination of the Council of Trent: Vol. I. Trans. Fred Kramer,  St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1971, pp. 639-52, "The Third Question: Whether the Good Works of the Regenerate in This Life Are So Perfect that They Fully, Abundantly, and Perfectly Satisfy the Divine Law".&lt;/ref&gt; Every human thought and deed is infected with sin and [[Concupiscence|sinful motives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%206:5;&amp;version=9; Gen. 6:5], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%208:21;&amp;version=31;#en-NIV-205 8:21], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat.%207:17;&amp;version=31; Mat. 7:17], [[Charles Porterfield Krauth|Krauth, C.P.]],&lt;cite&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qiURAAAAIAAJ&amp;jtp=388 The Conservative Reformation and Its Theology: As Represented in the Augsburg Confession, and in the History and Literature of the Evangelical Lutheran Church] &lt;/cite&gt;. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott. 1875. pp. 388-90, Part IX The Specific Doctrines Of The Conservative Reformation: Original Sin, Thesis VII The Results, Section ii Positive.&lt;/ref&gt; For Luther himself, in his ''Bondage of the Will'', people are by nature endowed with free-will/free choice in regard to “goods and possessions” with which a person “has the right of using, acting, and omitting according to his Free-will.” However, in “God-ward” things pertaining to “salvation or damnation” people are in bondage “either to the will of God, or to the will of Satan.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823),  66.&lt;/ref&gt;

As found in [[Paul Althaus]]’ study of Luther’s theology,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Althaus, ''The Theology of Martin Luther'' (Fortress, 1966), §§ “The Bondage of the Will” and “Original Sin,” 156-170, 247.&lt;/ref&gt; sin’s infection of every human thought and deed began with [[Fall of man|Adam’s fall]] into sin, the [[Original sin|Original Sin]]. Adam’s fall was a “terrible example” of what “free will” will do unless God constantly motivates it to virtuous behavior. Humanity inherits Adam’s sin. Thus, in our “natural condition,” we have an inborn desire to sin because that is the person we are by birth. As Luther noted, “Adam sinned willingly and freely and from him a will to sin has been born into us so that we cannot sin innocently but only voluntarily.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Althaus, ''The Theology of Martin Luther'' (Fortress, 1966), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial term ''liberum arbitrium'' was translated “free-will” by [[Henry Cole (minister)|Henry Cole]]&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823)&lt;/ref&gt; and “free will” remains in general use. However, the [[Ernest Gordon Rupp|Rupp]]/Watson study of Luther and Erasmus chose “free choice” as the translation and provided a rationale.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson, ''Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation'' (Westminister, 1969), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther used “free choice” (or “free-will”) to denote the fact that humans act “spontaneously” and with “a desirous willingness.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823), 60&lt;/ref&gt; He also allowed “Free-will” as that “power” by which humans “can be caught by the Spirit” of God.&lt;ref&gt;63BOWCole&lt;/ref&gt; However, he deplored the use of the term “Free-will” because it is too “grand, copious, and full.” Therefore, Luther held that the inborn faculty of “willingness” should be “called by some other term.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823), 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although our wills are a function of and are in bondage to our inherited sinful desires, Luther insisted that we sin “voluntarily.” Voluntarily means that we sin of our own free will.&lt;ref&gt;“Voluntarily” means “of one's own free will.” http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/voluntarily&lt;/ref&gt; We will to do what we desire. As long as we desire sin, our wills are only free for sin. This is Luther’s “bondage of the will” to sin. The sinner’s “will is bound, but it is and remains ''his'' will. He repeatedly and voluntarily acts according to it.” So it is, to be set free from sin and for righteousness requires a “rebirth through faith.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Althaus, ''The Theology of Martin Luther'' (Fortress, 1966), 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt; A rebirth of faith gives “true freedom from sin,” which is, wrote Luther, "a liberty [freedom] to do good.”&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Commentary on Romans'', J. Theodore Mueller, translator (Kregel Classics, 1976), xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

To use a biblical word important to Luther, to be set free ''from'' sin and ''for'' righteousness requires a [[Metanoia (theology)|metanoia]].&lt;ref&gt;Treadwell Walden, ''The Great Meaning of the Word Metanoia: Lost in the Old Version, Unrecovered in the New'' (Thomas Whittaker, 1896), 26, footnote #1. Available online in Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther used Jesus’ image of [[The Tree and its Fruits|the good and bad trees]] to depict the necessity of changing the person to change what a person wills and does. In Jesus’ image, “a good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit” (Matthew 7:18).&lt;ref&gt;Steven D. Paulson, ''Luther for the Armchair Theologians'' (Westminster John Knox, 2004), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the bad tree that can only produce bad fruit, before a rebirth through faith, people are in bondage to the sinful desires of their hearts. They can only will to do sin, albeit “spontaneously and with a desirous willingness.”&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Lutzer, ''The Doctrines That Divide: A Fresh Look at the Historic Doctrines That Separate Christians'' (Kregel, 1998), 172-173.&lt;/ref&gt; Given his view of the human condition, Luther concluded that, without a rebirth, the “free choice” that all humans possess is “not free at all” because it cannot of itself free itself from its inherent bondage to sin.&lt;ref&gt;''Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation'', edited by Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson (Westminister, 1969), 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Luther distinguished between different kinds of freedom: (a) by nature, a freedom to act as we will and (b) by rebirth through faith, a freedom to act righteously.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, “On the Bondage of the Will” (1525), in ''Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation'', edited by Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson (Westminister, 1969, reissued by Westminster John Knox, 2006), 27, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

====God and creation====
Orthodox Lutheran theology holds that God made the world, including humanity, perfect, holy and sinless. However, [[Adam and Eve]] chose to disobey God, trusting in their own strength, knowledge, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Sponheim, "The Origin of Sin," in &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;, Carl E. Braaten and Robert W. Jenson, eds. (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984), 385–407.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pieper"&gt;[[Franz August Otto Pieper|Francis Pieper]], "Definition of Original Sin," in &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt; (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1953), 1:538.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, people are saddled with [[Original sin#Lutheranism|original sin]], born sinful and unable to avoid committing sinful acts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Porterfield Krauth|Krauth, C.P.]],&lt;cite&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qiURAAAAIAAJ&amp;jtp=355 The Conservative Reformation and Its Theology: As Represented in the Augsburg Confession, and in the History and Literature of the Evangelical Lutheran Church] &lt;/cite&gt;.

Lippincott. 1875. pp. 335-455, Part IX The Specific Doctrines Of The Conservative Reformation: Original Sin.&lt;/ref&gt; For Lutherans, original sin is the "chief sin, a root and fountainhead of all actual sins."&lt;ref&gt;[[Formula of Concord]], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-sd/originalsin.html Original Sin].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Predestination====
Lutherans believe that the elect are predestined to salvation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:48;&amp;version=9; Acts 13:48], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph.%201:4-11;&amp;version=47; Eph. 1:4–11], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election.

Lutherans disagree with those that make predestination the source of salvation rather than Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection. Lutherans reject the Calvinist doctrine of the [[perseverance of the saints]]. Like both Calvinist camps, Lutherans view the work of salvation as monergistic in that "the natural [that is, corrupted and divinely unrenewed] powers of man cannot do anything or help towards salvation" ([[Formula of Concord]]: [http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/freewill.html Solid Declaration, art. ii, par. 71]), and Lutherans go further along the same lines as the Free Grace advocates to say that the recipient of saving grace need not cooperate with it. Hence, Lutherans believe that a true Christian (that is, a genuine recipient of saving grace) can lose his or her salvation, "[b]ut the cause is not as though God were unwilling to grant grace for perseverance to those in whom He has begun the good work... [but that these persons] wilfully turn away..." ([http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/election.html Formula of Concord: Solid Declaration, art. xi, par. 42]). Unlike Calvinists, Lutherans do not believe in a predestination to damnation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim.%202:4;&amp;version=31; 1 Tim. 2:4], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pet.%203:9;&amp;version=31; 2 Pet. 3:9], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election. Epitome of the Formula of Concord, Article 11, Election], and Engelder's [https://archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 Popular Symbolics], Part XXXI. The Election of Grace, pp. 124-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Lutherans teach eternal damnation is a result of the unbeliever's sins, rejection of the forgiveness of sins, and unbelief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%2013:9;&amp;version=9; Hos. 13:9], Mueller, J.T., &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;.

"Eternal Death", paragraph 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anabaptism====
The [[Anabaptist]] movement was characterized by the fundamental belief in the free will of man. Many earlier movements such as [[Waldensians]] and others likewise held this viewpoint.  Denominations today representing this view include [[Old Order Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Conservative Mennonites]].

====Calvinism====
{{main article|Calvinism}}
[[John Calvin]] ascribed “free will” to all people in the sense that they act “voluntarily, and not by compulsion.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, III.23.2. Available online at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.toc.html CCEL.org.&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated his position by allowing "that man has choice and that it is self-determined” and that his actions stem from “his own voluntary choosing.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin from ''Bondage and Liberation of the Will'', edited by A.N.S. Lane, translated by G. I. Davies (Baker Academic, 2002) 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The free will that Calvin ascribed to all people is what [[Mortimer Adler#Freedom and free will|Mortimer Adler]] calls the “natural freedom” of the will. This freedom to will what one desires is inherent in all people.&lt;ref name="Mortimer J. Adler 1958"/&gt;

Calvin held this kind of inherent/natural&lt;ref&gt;Inherent and natural are synonyms. http://thesaurus.com/browse/inherent.&lt;/ref&gt; free will in disesteem because unless people acquire the freedom to live as they ought by being transformed, they will desire and voluntarily choose to sin. “Man is said to have free will,” wrote Calvin, “because he acts voluntarily, and not by compulsion. This is perfectly true: but why should so small a matter have been dignified with so proud a title?”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, II.2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The glitch in this inherent/natural freedom of the will is that although all people have the “faculty of willing,” by nature they are unavoidably (and yet voluntarily without compulsion) under “the bondage of sin.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, II.3.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kind of free will that Calvin esteems is what Adler calls “acquired freedom” of the will, the freedom/ability&lt;ref&gt;Freedom and ability are synonyms. http://thesaurus.com/browse/freedom.&lt;/ref&gt; “to live as [one] ought.” To possess acquired free will requires a change by which a person acquires a desire to live a life marked by virtuous qualities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As Calvin describes the change required for acquired freedom, the will “must be wholly transformed and renovated.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, II.3.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin depicts this transformation as “a new heart and a new spirit (Ezek. 18:31).” It sets one free from “bondage to sin” and enables “piety towards God, and love towards men, general holiness and purity of life.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, III.3.6, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] embrace the idea of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]], namely, that God chose who would be saved and who would be not saved prior to the creation.  They quote Ephesians 1:4 "For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight" and also 2:8 "For it is by grace you are saved, through faith, and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." One of the strongest defenders of this theological point of view was the American [[Puritan]] preacher and theologian [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]].

Edwards believed that indeterminism was incompatible with individual dependence on God and hence with his sovereignty. He reasoned that if individuals' responses to God's grace are contra-causally free, then their salvation depends partly on them and therefore God's sovereignty is not "absolute and universal." Edwards' book ''Freedom of the Will'' defends theological determinism. In this book, Edwards attempts to show that libertarianism is incoherent. For example, he argues that by 'self-determination' the libertarian must mean either that one's actions including one's acts of willing are preceded by an act of free will or that one's acts of will lack sufficient causes. The first leads to an infinite regress while the second implies that acts of will happen accidentally and hence can't make someone "better or worse, any more than a tree is better than other trees because it oftener happens to be lit upon by a swan or nightingale; or a rock more vicious than other rocks, because rattlesnakes have happened oftener to crawl over it."&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom of the Will'', 1754; Edwards 1957-, vol. 1, pp. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should not be thought that this view completely denies freedom of choice, however. It claims that man is free to act on his strongest moral impulse and volition, which is externally determined, but is not free to act contrary to them, or to alter them. Proponents, such as [[John L. Girardeau]], have indicated their belief that moral neutrality is impossible; that even if it were possible, and one were equally inclined to contrary options, one could make no choice at all; that if one is inclined, however slightly, toward one option, then that person will necessarily choose that one over any others.

Some non-Calvinist Christians attempt a reconciliation of the dual concepts of predestination and free will by pointing to the situation of God as Christ. In taking the form of a man, a necessary element of this process was that Jesus Christ lived the existence of a mortal. When Jesus was born he was not born with the omniscient power of God the Creator, but with the mind of a human child - yet he was still God in essence. The precedent this creates is that God is able to will the abandonment of His knowledge, or ignore knowledge, while remaining fully God. Thus it is not inconceivable that although omniscience demands that God knows what the future holds for individuals, it is within his power to deny this knowledge in order to preserve individual free will. Other theologians argue that the Calvinist-Edwardsean view suggests that if all human volitions are predetermined by God, then all actions dictated by fallen will of man necessarily satisfy His sovereign decree. Hence, it is impossible to act outside of God's perfect will, a conclusion some non-Calvinists claim poses a serious problem for ethics and [[moral theology]].

An early proposal toward such a reconciliation states that God is, in fact, not aware of future events, but rather, being eternal, He is outside time, and sees the past, present, and future as one whole creation.  Consequently, it is not as though God would know "in advance" that [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] would become guilty of homicide years prior to the event as an example, but that He was aware of it from all eternity, viewing all time as a single present.  This was the view offered by [[Boethius]] in Book V of ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]''.

Calvinist theologian [[Loraine Boettner]] argued that the doctrine of divine foreknowledge does not escape the alleged problems of divine foreordination. He wrote that "what God foreknows must, in the very nature of the case, be as fixed and certain as what is foreordained; and if one is inconsistent with the free agency of man, the other is also. Foreordination renders the events certain, while foreknowledge presupposes that they are certain."[https://web.archive.org/web/20060805100404/http://www.solagratia.org/Articles/The_Foreknowledge_of_God.aspx] Some Christian theologians, feeling the bite of this argument, have opted to limit the doctrine of foreknowledge if not do away with it altogether, thus forming a new school of thought, similar to [[Socinianism]] and [[process theology]], called [[open theism]].

====Comparison of Protestants====
This table summarizes three classical Protestant beliefs about free will.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! John Calvin !! Martin Luther !! Jacob Arminius
|-
| For [[John Calvin|Calvin]], humanity possesses “free will,”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, III.23.2.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is in bondage to sin,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; unless it is “transformed.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, III.3.6.&lt;/ref&gt; || For [[Martin Luther|Luther]], humanity possesses free-will/free choice in regard to “goods and possessions,” but regarding “salvation or damnation” people are in bondage either to God or Satan.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Cole (minister)|Henry Cole]], trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823), 66. The controversial term ''liberum arbitrium'' was translated “free-will” by Cole. However [[Ernest Gordon Rupp]] and Philip Saville Watson, ''Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation'' (Westminister, 1969) chose “free choice” as their translation.&lt;/ref&gt; || For [[Jacobus Arminius|Arminius]], humanity possesses freedom from necessity, but not “freedom from sin” unless enabled by “[[prevenient grace]].”&lt;ref&gt;Keith D. Stanglin and Thomas H. McCall, ''Jacob Arminius: Theologian of Grace'' (Oxford University, 2012), 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{Main article|Agency (LDS Church)}}
[[Mormonism|Mormons]] or Latter-day Saints, believe that God has given all humans the gift of moral agency. Moral agency includes free will and [[Agency (Mormonism)|agency]]. Proper exercise of unfettered choice leads to the ultimate goal of returning to God's presence. Having the choice to do right or wrong was important, because God wants a society of a certain type—those that comply with eternal laws. Before this Earth was created, this dispute over agency rose to the level that there was a "[[War of Heaven|war in heaven]]." [[Lucifer]] (who favored no agency) and his followers were cast out of heaven for rebelling against God's will.  Many Mormon leaders have also taught that the battle in Heaven over agency is now being carried out on earth{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, where dictators, influenced by Satan, fight against freedom (or free agency) in governments contrary to the will of God.

Mormons also believe in a limited form of foreordination — not in deterministic, unalterable decrees, but rather in callings from God for individuals to perform specific missions in mortality. Those who are foreordained can reject the foreordination, either outright or by transgressing the laws of God and becoming unworthy to fulfill the call.

===New Church===
[[The New Church]], or Swedenborgianism, teaches that every person has complete freedom to choose heaven or hell. [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], upon whose writings the New Church is founded, argued that if God is love itself, people must have free will.  If God is love itself, then He desires no harm to come to anyone: and so it is impossible that he would predestine anyone to hell.  On the other hand, if God is love itself, then He must love things outside of Himself; and if people do not have the freedom to choose evil, they are simply extensions of God, and He cannot love them as something outside of Himself.  In addition, Swedenborg argues that if a person does not have free will to choose goodness and faith, then all of the commandments in the Bible to love God and the neighbor are worthless, since no one can choose to do them - and it is impossible that a God who is love itself and wisdom itself would give impossible commandments.

==Hinduism==
{{see also|Free will#In Hindu philosophy}}
As [[Hinduism]] is primarily a conglomerate of different religious traditions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuhcs.org.uk/info.faq.php Cambridge University HCS] "Since Hinduism is itself a conglomerate of religions, an attitude of tolerance and acceptance of the validity of other belief systems has long been a part of Hindu thought."&lt;/ref&gt; there is no one accepted view on the concept of free will. Within the predominant schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] there are two main opinions. The [[Advaita]] ([[monistic]]) schools generally believe in a [[destiny|fate]]-based approach, and the [[Dvaita]] ([[Dualistic cosmology#Theistic dualism|dualistic]]) schools are proponents for the theory of free will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrologyforthesoul.com/vp/predictiveastrologyfatekarmafreewill.htm Predictive Astrology - Understanding Karma, Fate, &amp; Free Will ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206040507/http://www.astrologyforthesoul.com/vp/predictiveastrologyfatekarmafreewill.htm |date=2006-12-06 }} "“Dvaita” or dualism and is generally a proponent of a free will orientation. The path of surrender or non-action, represents “Advaita” or non-dualism and is generally a proponent of fate orientation."&lt;/ref&gt; The different schools' understandings are based upon their conceptions of the nature of the supreme Being (see [[Brahman]], [[Paramatma]] and [[Ishvara]]) and how the individual soul ([[Atman (Hinduism)|atma]] or [[jiva]]) dictates, or is dictated by [[karma]] within the illusory existence of [[Maya (illusion)|maya]].

In both Dvaita and Advaita schools, and also in the many other traditions within Hinduism, there is a strong belief in [[destiny]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayanacademy.com/basics/nineb/ Himalayan Academy] "Hindus believe in karma, the law of cause and effect by which each individual creates his own destiny by his thoughts, words and deeds"&lt;/ref&gt; and that both the past and future are known, or viewable, by certain [[saint]]s or [[rishi|mystics]] as well as by the supreme being ([[Ishvara]]) in traditions where Ishvara is worshipped as an ''all-knowing being''. In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Avatar]], [[Krishna]] says to [[Arjuna]]: 
*''I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/7/26 Bhagavad Gita 7.26] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220001/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/7/26/en1 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this belief in destiny is not necessarily believed to rule out the existence of free will, as in some cases both free will and destiny are believed to exist simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/3/27/en1 Bhagavad-Gita 3.27] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707123748/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/3/27/en1 |date=2012-07-07 }} "The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedabase.net/bg/15/7/en1 B-Gita 15.7 purport] "As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental portions of His qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity, as an individual soul, has his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] also states:
:: ''Nor does the Supreme Lord assume anyone's sinful or pious activities'' (Bhagavad Gita 5.15)
:: ''From wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the self'' (Bhagavad Gita 6.26), indicating that God does not control anyone's will, and that it is possible to control the mind.

===Different approaches===
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] give differing opinions: In the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.  For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will.  The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name="viveka"&gt;Swami Vivekananda (1907) "Freedom" from The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. vol. 1.  [http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/vol_1 ((online))]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Vivekananda's above quote can't be taken as a literal refutation of all free will, as Vivekanda's teacher, [[Ramakrishna Paramahansa]] used to teach that man is like a goat tied to a stake - the karmic debts and human nature bind him and the amount of free will he has is analogous to the amount of freedom the rope allows; as one progresses spiritually, the rope becomes longer.

On the other hand, [[Mimamsa]], [[Vedanta]], and the more theistic versions of Hinduism such as [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] have often emphasized the importance of free will. For example, in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] the living beings ([[jiva]]s) are described as being of a ''higher nature'' who have the freedom to exploit the inferior material nature ([[prakrti]]):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/7/5/en1 Bhagavad Gita 7.5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301173148/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/7/5/en1 |date=2007-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The doctrine of [[Karma in Hinduism]] requires both that we pay for our actions in the past, and that our actions in the present be free enough to allow us to deserve the future reward or punishment that we will receive for our present actions. The [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitin]] philosopher [[Chandrashekhara Bharati|Chandrashekhara Bharati Swaminah]] puts it this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fate is past karma, free-will is present karma.  Both are really one, that is, karma, though they may differ in the matter of time.  There can be no conflict when they are really one.

Fate, as I told you, is the resultant of the past exercise of your free-will.  By exercising your free-will in the past, you brought on the resultant fate.  By exercising your free-will in the present, I want you to wipe out your past record if it hurts you, or to add to it if you find it enjoyable.  In any case, whether for acquiring more happiness or for reducing misery, you have to exercise your free-will in the present.&lt;ref name="Swami"&gt;[[Chandrashekhara Bharati]] in ''Dialogues with the Guru'' by R. Krishnaswami Aiyar, Chetana Limited, Bombay, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Islam==
{{See also|Predestination in Islam}}
Disputes about free will in [[Islam]] began with the [[Mu'tazili]] vs [[Hanbali]] disputes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldschmit|first=Arthur|title=A Concise History of the Middle East|year=2010|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-4388-4|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Mu'tazili arguing that humans had ''qadar'', the capacity to do right or wrong, and thus deserved the reward or punishment they received, whereas Hanbali insisted on God's ''jabr'', or total power and initiative in managing all events.&lt;ref&gt;Denny, Frederick. An Introduction to Islam, 1985 Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools that developed around earlier thinkers such as [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] searched for ways to explain how both human ''qadar'' and divine ''jabr'' could be asserted at the same time.  Ash'ari develops a "dual agency" or "acquisition" account of free will in which every human action has two distinct agents. God creates the possibility of a human action with his divine ''jabr'', but then the human follows through and "acquires" the act, making it theirs and taking responsibility for it using their human ''qadar''.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Montgomery. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948.; Wolfson, Harry. The Philosophy of Kalam, 1976 Harvard University Press and {{cite web |url=http://umcc.ais.org/~maftab/ip/pdf/bktxt/kalam.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823124700/http://umcc.ais.org/~maftab/ip/pdf/bktxt/kalam.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
The belief in free will ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''bechirah chofshit'' בחירה חפשית, ''bechirah'' בחירה) is [[axiom]]atic in [[Jewish principles of faith|Jewish thought]], and is closely linked with the concept of reward and punishment, based on the [[Torah]] itself: "I [God] have set before you life and death, blessing and curse: therefore choose life" ( [[Deuteronomy]] 30:19).

Free will is therefore discussed at length in [[Jewish philosophy]], firstly as regards God's purpose in [[Creation myth|creation]], and secondly as regards the closely related, resultant, [[paradox]]. The topic is also often discussed in connection with [[Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition|Negative theology]], [[Divine simplicity]] and [[Divine Providence#In Jewish thought|Divine Providence]], as well as [[Jewish principles of faith]] in general.

===Free will and creation===
The traditional teaching regarding the purpose of [[Jewish principles of faith#God as Creator of the universe|creation]], particularly as influenced by [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], is that "This world is like a corridor to the [[Jewish eschatology#The afterlife and olam haba (the world to come)|World to Come]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' {{cite web |url=http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/04-16.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830200534/http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/04-16.htm |archivedate=2006-08-30 |df= }} 4:16]&lt;/ref&gt; "Man was created for the sole purpose of rejoicing in God, and deriving pleasure from the splendor of His Presence… The place where this joy may truly be derived is the World to Come, which was expressly created to provide for it; but the path to the object of our desires is this world..."&lt;ref&gt;([[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'', [http://www.shechem.org/torah/mesyesh/1.htm Ch.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912040826/http://www.shechem.org/torah/mesyesh/1.htm |date=2006-09-12 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Free will is thus required by God's justice, “otherwise, Man would not be given or denied good for actions over which he had no control”.&lt;ref name="aish.com"&gt;http://www.aish.com/literacy/concepts/The_Essence_of_Mankind.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

It is further understood that in order for Man to have true free choice, he must not only have inner free will, but also an environment in which a choice between obedience and disobedience exists. God thus created the world such that both good and evil can operate freely, this is the meaning of the rabbinic [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]], "All is in the hands of Heaven except the fear of Heaven".&lt;ref&gt;([[Talmud]], ''Berachot'' 33b)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maimonides,
{{quote|Free will is granted to every man. If he desires to incline towards the good way and be righteous, he has the power to do so; and if he desires to incline towards the unrighteous way and be a wicked man, he also has the power to do so. Give no place in your minds to that which is asserted by many of the ignorant: namely that the Holy One, blessed be He, decrees that a man from his birth should be either righteous or wicked. Since the power of doing good or evil is in our own hands, and since all the wicked deeds which we have committed have been committed with our full consciousness, it befits us to turn in penitence and to forsake our evil deed.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The paradox of free will===
In [[rabbinic literature]], there is much discussion as to the apparent [[contradiction]] between God's [[omniscience]] and free will. The representative view is that "Everything is foreseen; yet free will is given".&lt;ref&gt;([[Rabbi Akiva]], ''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' [http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/03-15.htm 3:15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830203834/http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/03-15.htm |date=2006-08-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this understanding, the problem is formally described as a [[paradox]], beyond our understanding.
{{quote|The Holy One, Blessed Be He, knows everything that will happen before it has happened. So does He know whether a particular person will be righteous or wicked, or not? If He does know, then it will be impossible for that person not to be righteous. If He knows that he will be righteous but that it is possible for him to be wicked, then He does not know everything that He has created. ...[T]he Holy One, Blessed Be He, does not have any temperaments and is outside such realms, unlike people, whose selves and temperaments are two separate things. God and His temperaments are one, and God's existence is beyond the comprehension of Man… [Thus] we do not have the capabilities to comprehend how the Holy One, Blessed Be He, knows all creations and events. [Nevertheless] know without doubt that people do what they want without the Holy One, Blessed Be He, forcing or decreeing upon them to do so... It has been said because of this that a man is judged according to all his actions.|[[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panix.com/~jjbaker/MadaT.html ''Teshuva'' 5:5]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The paradox is explained, but not resolved, by observing that God exists outside of [[time]], and therefore, his knowledge of the future is exactly the same as his knowledge of the past and present. Just as his knowledge of the past does not interfere with man's free will, neither does his knowledge of the future.&lt;ref name="aish.com"/&gt; This distinction, between [[Foreknowledge of God|foreknowledge]] and [[predestination]], is in fact discussed by [[Abraham ibn Daud]].

One [[analogy]] here is that of [[time travel]]. The time traveller, having returned from the future, knows in advance what x will do, but while he knows what x will do, that knowledge does not cause x to do so: x had free will, even while the time traveller had foreknowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/John_Gribbin/timetrav.htm#time_an_illusion See]&lt;/ref&gt; One objection raised against this analogy – and ibn Daud’s distinction – is that if x truly has free will, he may choose to act otherwise when the event in question comes to pass, and therefore the time traveller (or God) merely has knowledge of a ''possible'' event: even having seen the event, there is no way to know with certainty what x will do; see the view of [[Gersonides]] below.  Further, the presence of the time traveller, may have had some [[chaos theory|chaotic]] effect on x's circumstances and choice, absent when the event comes to pass in the present.)

===Alternate approaches===
Although the above discussion of the paradox represents the majority Rabbinic view, there are several major thinkers who resolve the issue by explicitly ''excluding'' human action from divine foreknowledge.

Both [[Emunoth ve-Deoth#iv Free will: obedience and disobedience|Saadia Gaon]] and [[Judah ha-Levi]] hold that "the decisions of man precede God's knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=363&amp;letter=F&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gersonides]] holds that God knows, beforehand, the choices open to each individual, but does not know which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make. [[Isaiah Horowitz]] takes the view that God cannot know which moral choices people will make, but that, nevertheless, this does not impair his perfection.

In line with this thinking, the teaching from ''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' above, is then to be read as: "Everything&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chagigah]]'' [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l2b01.htm 5b]: " Rab said: Even the superfluous conversation between a man and his wife is declared to a person in the hour of his death."&lt;/ref&gt; is ''observed'' (while - and no matter where - it happens), ''and'' (since the actor is unaware of being observed) free will is given ".&lt;ref&gt;See for example, the [[Mishnah#Commentaries|commentary]] of  "The Bartenura", [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], ''[[ad loc]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kabbalistic thought===
The existence of free will, and the paradox above (as addressed by either approach), is closely linked to the concept of ''[[Tzimtzum]]''. ''Tzimtzum'' entails the idea that God "constricted" his [[Infinity|infinite]] essence, to allow for the existence of a "conceptual space" in which a [[wiktionary:finite|finite]], independent world could exist. This "constriction" made free will possible, and hence the potential to earn the [[Jewish eschatology#Olam Haba - the afterlife and the world to come|World to Come]].

Further, according to the first approach, it is understood that the Free-will Omniscience paradox provides a temporal parallel to the paradox inherent within ''Tzimtzum''. In granting free will, God has somehow "constricted" his foreknowledge, to allow for Man's independent action; He thus has foreknowledge and yet free will exists. In the case of ''Tzimtzum'', God has "constricted" his essence to allow for Man's independent existence; He is thus [[Immanence|immanent]] and yet [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]].

In [[engineering]], a '''function''' is interpreted as a specific [[process (engineering)|process]], action or [[Task analysis|task]] that a [[system]] is able to perform.&lt;ref&gt;R.Barker, C. Longman, Case Method: Function and Process Modelling, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In engineering design==

In the [[enterprise life cycle|lifecycle]] of engineering projects, there are usually distinguished subsequently: ''[[Requirements]]'' and ''[[Functional specification]]'' documents. The ''[[Requirement]]s'' usually specifies the most important attributes of the requested system. In the ''Design specification'' documents, physical or software processes and systems are frequently the requested functions

==In products==
For advertising and marketing of technical products, the number of functions they can perform is often counted and used for promotion. For example a [[calculator]] capable of the basic mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, would be called a "four-function" model; when other operations are added, for example for scientific, financial, or statistical calculations, advertisers speak of "57 scientific functions", etc. A wristwatch with stopwatch and timer facilities would similarly claim a specified number of functions. To maximise the claim, trivial operations which do not significantly enhance the functionality of a product may be counted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5979">The '''Goodwin model''', sometimes called '''Goodwin’s class struggle model''', is a model of endogenous economic fluctuations first proposed by the American economist [[Richard M. Goodwin]] in 1967. It combines aspects of the [[Harrod–Domar]] growth model with the [[Phillips curve]] to generate endogenous cycles in economic activity (output, unemployment, wages) unlike most modern macroeconomic models in which movements in economic aggregates are driven by exogenously assumed shocks. Since Goodwin’s publication in 1967 the model has been extended and applied in various ways.

== The model ==

Output is given by the aggregate production function

: &lt;math&gt; q = \min\left(a\ell,\frac {k} {\sigma}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
 
: ''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is aggregate output
: ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is employment of labor
: ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is (homogeneous) capital
: ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is labor productivity
: ''σ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is the capital-output ratio, a constant.

All of these variables are functions of time, though the time subscripts have been suppressed for convenience. 

Unlike in the Harrod–Domar model, full capital utilization is assumed. Hence

: &lt;math&gt;a\ell=\frac {k} {\sigma}=q&lt;/math&gt;

at all times. The employment rate is given by

: &lt;math&gt;v=\frac {\ell} {n}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is total labor force which grows at the rate ''β''. Additionally, labor productivity ''a'', is assumed to also increase at the rate ''α''. Note that in this case the rate of growth of the employment rate is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dv/dt}{v} = g_v=g_\ell-\beta.&lt;/math&gt;

The growth rate of the absolute level of employment in turn is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\ell/dt}{\ell} =g_\ell=g_q-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Wages are assumed to change according to a linearized [[Phillips curve]] relationship given by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dw/dt}{w}=g_w=\rho v-\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if the labor market is '[[Market tightness|tight]]' (employment is already high) there is upward pressure on wages and vice versa in a 'lax' labor market. This is the aspect of the model that can loosely be associated with the "class struggle" portion of its name, however, this kind of Phillips curve can be found in many Macroeconomic models.

The [[wage share|workers' share in output]] is ''u'', which by definition is

: &lt;math&gt;u=\frac {w\ell} {q} = \frac {w} {a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the growth rate of the workers' share is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {du/dt}{u} = g_u=g_w-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Labor's share in output increases with wages but declines with productivity growth as less workers are needed to produce the same amount of output.

Finally we have the capital accumulation equation and the resulting growth rate for output (since k and q grow at the same rate by assumption of full utilization of capital and constant returns to scale). It is assumed that workers consume their wages and capital owners save a portion s of their profits (note that the model generalizes to the case where capitalists save more than workers) and that capital depreciates at the rate delta. The growth rate of output and capital is then given by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dk/dt}{k} = g_k=g_q=s(1-u)(q/k)-\delta.&lt;/math&gt;

This in turn implies that

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dv/dt}{v} = g_v=\frac {s(1-u)}{\sigma} -(\delta +\alpha + \beta).&lt;/math&gt;

===Solution===

The two differential equations

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dv/dt}{v} = g_v=\frac {s(1-u)} {\sigma} -(\delta +\alpha + \beta)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {du/dt}{u} = g_u=\rho v-\gamma-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

are the key equations of the model and in fact are the [[Lotka–Volterra equations]] (which are used in biology to model predator-prey interaction).

While the model can be solved explicitly it is instructive to analyze the trajectory of the economy in terms of a [[Phase space|phase diagram]]. Setting the two equations above equal to zero we get the values of ''u'' and ''v'' at which growth of ''v'' and growth ''u'', respectively, are zero.

: &lt;math&gt;u* = 1- \frac {(\delta+\alpha+\beta) \sigma} {s}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;v*=\frac {\gamma + \alpha} {\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

These two lines (along with parameter restrictions which ensure that neither u nor v can go higher than 1) divide the positive orthant into four regions. The figure below indicates with arrows the movement of the economy in each region. For example the north-western region (high employment, low labor's share in output) the economy is moving north-east (employment is rising, worker's share is increasing). Once it crosses the u* line it will begin moving south-west.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Goodwin2.JPG]]&lt;/center&gt;

The figure below illustrates the movement of potential output (output at full employment), actual output and wages over time.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GoodwinModelTime.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

As can be seen the Goodwin model can generate endogenous fluctuations in economic activity without relying on extraneous assumptions of outside shocks, whether on the demand or supply side.

The model has been applied and extended by many economists since its first presentation in 1967.

==Statistics==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68114">{{Race}} 
The concept of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] as a rough division of [[anatomically modern human]]s (''Homo sapiens'') has a long and complicated history. The word ''race'' itself is modern and was used in the sense of "[[nation]], [[ethnic group]]" during the 16th to 19th century, and only acquired its modern meaning in the field of [[physical anthropology]] from the mid 19th century. The politicization of the field under the concept of [[racism]] in the 20th century led to a decline in racial studies during the 1930s to 1980s, culminating in a [[poststructuralist]] [[deconstruction]] of [[Race and society|race as a social construct]].

==Etymology==
The word "race", interpreted to mean an identifiable group of people who share a [[common descent]], was introduced into [[English language|English]] in about 1580, from the Old French ''{{wiktfra|rasse}}'' (1512), from Italian ''{{wiktita|razza}}''{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. An earlier but etymologically distinct word for a similar concept was the Latin word ''{{wiktlat|genus}}'' meaning a group sharing qualities related to birth, descent, origin, race, stock, or family; this Latin word is [[cognate]] with the Greek words "genos", ({{wiktell|γένος}}) meaning "race or kind", and "gonos", which has meanings related to "birth, offspring, stock ...".&lt;ref name=OEDHarper&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=genus | title= Online Etymology Dictionary | work= genus | publisher= Douglas Harper | accessdate = March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
In many ancient civilizations, individuals with widely varying physical appearances became full members of a [[society]] by growing up within that society or by adopting that society's [[culture|cultural]] [[norm (sociology)|norms]]. (Snowden 1983; Lewis 1990).

[[Classical civilization]]s from [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] to [[History of China#Ancient China|China]] tended to invest the most importance in [[family|familial]] or tribal affiliation than an individual's physical appearance (Dikötter 1992; Goldenberg 2003){{Citation needed|reason=references given do not appear in the bibliography|date=February 2018}}. Societies still tended to equate physical characteristics, such as hair and eye colour, with psychological and moral qualities, usually assigning the highest qualities to their own people and lower qualities to the "Other", either lower classes or outsiders to their society. For example, an historian of the 3rd century [[Han Dynasty]] in the territory of present-day China describes [[barbarian]]s of blond hair and green eyes as resembling "the monkeys from which they are descended".&lt;ref name=Gossett&gt;Gossett, Thomas F. New Edition, ''Race: The History of an Idea in America.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-509778-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Gossett, pp.&amp;nbsp;4).

Dominant in ancient Greek and Roman conceptions of human diversity was the thesis that physical differences between different populations could be attributed to environmental factors. Though ancient peoples likely had no knowledge of evolutionary theory or genetic variability, their concepts of race could be described as malleable. Chief among environmental causes for physical difference in the ancient period were climate and geography. Though thinkers in ancient civilizations recognized differences in physical characteristics between different populations, the general consensus was that all non-Greeks were barbarians. This barbarian status, however, was not thought to be fixed; rather, one could shed the 'barbarian' status simply by adopting Greek culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44066982|title=The Emperor's new clothes : biological theories of race at the millennium|last=1955-|first=Graves, Joseph L.,|date=2001|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813533025|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|oclc=44066982}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Graves 2001)

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Hippocrates rubens.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Hippocrates of Cos]].]]
[[Hippocrates of Cos]] believed, as many thinkers throughout early history did, that factors such as geography and climate played a significant role in the physical appearance of different peoples. He writes, "the forms and dispositions of mankind correspond with the nature of the country". He attributed physical and temperamental differences among different peoples to environmental factors such as climate, water sources, elevation and terrain. He noted that temperate climates created peoples who were "sluggish" and "not apt for labor", while extreme climates led to peoples who were "sharp", "industrious" and "vigilant". He also noted that peoples of "mountainous, rugged, elevated, and well-watered" countries displayed "enterprising" and "warlike" characteristics, while peoples of "level, windy, and well-watered" countries were "unmanly" and "gentle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/airwatpl.24.24.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - On Airs, Waters, and Places by Hippocrates|website=classics.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] factored in the constitutions, laws, capacities, and character of peoples:

{{quote|"Come, tell me why it is that the Celts and the Germans are fierce, while the Hellenes and Romans are, generally speaking, inclined to political life and humane, though at the same time unyielding and warlike? Why the Egyptians are more intelligent and more given to crafts, and the Syrians unwarlike and effeminate, but at the same time intelligent, hot-tempered, vain and quick to learn? For if there is anyone who does not discern a reason for these differences among the nations, but rather declaims that all this so befell spontaneously, how, I ask, can he still believe that the universe is administered by a providence?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/julian_apostate_galileans_1_text.htm "Against the Galilaeans"] Book I, translated by Wilmer Cave Wright, PH.D.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Middle Ages===
European [[medieval]] models of race generally mixed [[Graeco-Roman|Classical]] ideas with the notion that humanity as a whole was descended from [[Shem]], [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] and [[Japheth]], the three [[sons of Noah]], producing distinct [[Semitic people|Semitic]] ([[Asia]]tic), [[Hamitic]] ([[Africa]]n), and [[Japhetites|Japhetic]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) peoples. This theory dates back to the Babylonian ''[[Talmud]]'', which states, "the descendants of Ham are cursed by being [[Black people|black]], and [it] depicts Ham as a sinful man and his progeny as degenerates."

In the 9th century, [[Al-Jahiz]], an [[Afro-Arab]] [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]], attempted to explain the origins of different [[human skin color]]s, particularly [[Black people|black skin]], which he believed to be the result of the environment. He cited a stony region of black [[basalt]] in the northern [[Najd]] as evidence for his theory.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence I. Conrad (1982), "Taun and Waba: Conceptions of Plague and Pestilence in Early Islam", ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'' '''25''' (3): 268–307 [278]:"[It] is so unusual that its gazelles and ostriches, its insects and flies, its foxes, sheep and asses, its horses and its birds are all black. Blackness and whiteness are in fact caused by the properties of the region, as well as by the God-given nature of water and soil and by the proximity or remoteness of the sun and the intensity or mildness of its heat."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century, the [[Sociology in medieval Islam|Islamic sociologist]] [[Ibn Khaldun]], dispelled the Babylonian ''Talmud'''s account of peoples and their characteristics as a myth. He wrote that black skin was due to the hot climate of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and not due to the descendants of Ham being cursed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title='Race', slavery and Islam in Maghribi Mediterranean thought: the question of the Haratin in Morocco|first=Chouki|last=El Hamel|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|volume=7|issue=3|year=2002|pages=29–52 [39–42]|doi=10.1080/13629380208718472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently of Ibn Kaldun's work, the question of whether skin colour is heritable or a product of the environment is raised in 17th to 18th century European anthropology. 
[[Georgius Hornius]] (1666) inherits the rabbinical view of heritability, while [[François Bernier]] (1684) argues for at least partial influence of the environment. 
Ibn Khaldun's work was later{{year needed|date=March 2018}} translated into French, especially for use in Algeria, but in the process, the work was "transformed from local knowledge to colonial categories of knowledge"{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--what does this even mean? whose opinion and/or terminology are we citing?--&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hannoum"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3590803 Abdelmajid Hannoum, "Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldun Orientalist"], ''History and Theory'', Vol. 42, Feb 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Desborough Cooley]]'1s ''The Negro Land of the Arabs Examined and Explained'' (1841) has excerpts of translations of Khaldun's work that were not affected by French colonial ideas.&lt;ref name="Cooley" /&gt; For example, Cooley quotes Khaldun's describing the great African civilization of Ghana (in Cooley's translation):

:"When the conquest of the West (by the Arabs) was completed, and merchants began to penetrate into the interior, they saw no nation of the Blacks so mighty as Ghánah, the dominions of which extended westward as far as the Ocean. The King's court was kept in the city of Ghánah, which, according to the author of the 'Book of Roger' (El Idrisi), and the author of the 'Book of Roads and Realms' (El Bekri), is divided into two parts, standing on both banks of the Nile, and ranks among the largest and most populous cities of the world.
:The people of Ghánah had for neighbours, on the east, a nation, which, according to historians, was called Súsú; after which came another named Máli; and after that another known by the name of Kaǘkaǘ; although some people prefer a different orthography, and write this name Kághó. The last-named nation was followed by a people called Tekrúr. The people of Ghánah declined in course of time, being overwhelmed or absorbed by the Molaththemún (or muffled people; that is, the Morabites), who, adjoining them on the north towards the [[Berber people|Berber]] country, attacked them, and, taking possession of their territory, compelled them to embrace the [[Mohammedan]] religion. The people of Ghánah, being invaded at a later period by the Súsú, a nation of Blacks in their neighbourhood, were exterminated, or mixed with other Black nations." &lt;ref name="Cooley"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6swTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 William Desborough Cooley, ''The Negro Land of the Arabs Examined and Explained''], London: J. Arrowsmith, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Khaldun suggests a link between the rise of the Almoravids and the decline of Ghana. But, historians have found virtually no evidence for an Almoravid conquest of Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~amcdouga/Hist446/readings/conquest_in_west_african_historiography.pdf Pekka Masonen, ''Not Quite Venus from the Waves: The Almoravid Conquest of Ghana in the Modern Historiography of Western Africa''], Humphrey J.

==Early Modern period==
Scientists who were interested in natural history, including biological and geological scientists, were known as "[[naturalists]]". They would collect, examine, describe, and arrange data from their explorations into categories according to certain criteria. People who were particularly skilled at organizing specific sets of data in a logically and comprehensive fashion were known as classifiers and systematists. This process was a new trend in science that served to help answer fundamental questions by collecting and organizing materials for systematic study, also known as [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].&lt;ref name="Smedley, Audrey 1999"&gt;Smedley, Audrey. Race in North America: Origin and Evolution of a Worldview. Boulder: Westview Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the study of natural history grew, so did society's effort to classify human groups. Some zoologists and scientists wondered what made humans different from animals in the primate family. Furthermore, they contemplated whether homo sapiens should be classified as one species with multiple varieties or separate species. In the 16th and 17th century, scientists attempted to classify ''Homo sapiens'' based on a geographic arrangement of human populations based on skin color, others simply on geographic location, shape, stature, food habits, and other distinguishing characteristics. Occasionally the term "race" was used but most of the early taxonomist used classificatory terms such as "peoples", "nations", "types", "varieties", and "species".

Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]] (1548–1600) and [[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596), French philosopher, attempted a rudimentary geographic arrangement of known human populations based on skin color. Bodin's color classifications were purely descriptive, including neutral terms such as "duskish colour, like roasted quinze", "black", "chestnut", and "farish white".&lt;ref name="Smedley, Audrey 1999"/&gt;

===17th century===
German and English scientists, [[Bernhard Varen]] (1622–1650) and [[John Ray]] (1627–1705) classified human populations into categories according to stature, shape, food habits, and skin color, along with any other distinguishing characteristics.&lt;ref name="Smedley, Audrey 1999"/&gt;
Ray was also the first person to produce a biological definition of [[species]].

[[François Bernier]] (1625–1688) is believed to have developed the first comprehensive classification of humans into distinct races which was published in a French journal article in 1684, ''Nouvelle division de la terre par les différentes espèces ou races l'habitant'', New division of Earth by the different species or races which inhabit it. (Gossett, 1997:32–33). Bernier advocated using the "four quarters" of the globe as the basis for providing labels for human differences.&lt;ref name="Smedley, Audrey 1999"/&gt; The four subgroups that Bernier used were Europeans, Far Easterners, Negroes (blacks), and Lapps.&lt;ref name="C. Loring, Brace 2005"&gt;C. Loring, Brace. ''"Race" is a Four-Letter Word: the Genesis of the Concept''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
{{see also|Scientific Racism#Origins of scientific racism}}
As noted earlier, scientists attempted to classify ''Homo sapiens'' based on a geographic arrangement of human populations. Some based their hypothetical divisions of race on the most obvious physical differences, like skin color, while others used geographic location, shape, stature, food habits, and other distinguishing characteristics to delineate between races. However, [[Cultural relativism|cultural notions]] of racial and gender superiority tainted early scientific discovery. In the 18th century, scientists began to include behavioral or psychological traits in their reported observations—which traits often had derogatory or demeaning implications—and researchers often assumed that those traits were related to their race, and therefore, innate and unchangeable. Other areas of interest were to determine the exact number of races, categorize and name them, and examine the primary and secondary causes of variation between groups.

The [[Great Chain of Being]], a medieval idea that there was a hierarchical structure of life from the most fundamental elements to the most perfect, began to encroach upon the idea of race. As taxonomy grew, scientists began to assume that the human species could be divided into distinct subgroups. One's "race" necessarily implied that one group had certain character qualities and physical dispositions that differentiated it from other human populations. Society assigned different values to those differentiations, as well as other, more trivial traits (a man with a strong chin was assumed to possess a stronger character than men with weaker chins). This essentially created a gap between races by deeming one race superior or inferior to another race, thus creating a hierarchy of races. In this way, science was used as justification for unfair treatment of different human populations.

The systematization of race concepts during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period brought with it the conflict between [[monogenism]] (a single origin for all human races) and [[polygenism]] (the hypothesis that races had separate origins). This debate was originally cast in [[creationist]] terms as a question of one versus many creations of humanity, but continued after [[evolution]] was widely accepted, at which point the question was given in terms of whether humans had split from their ancestral species one or many times.

====Johann Friedrich Blumenbach====
[[File:Johann Friedrich Blumenbach.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]
[[File:Blumenbach's five races.JPG|thumb|right|Blumenbach's five [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]].]]
[[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] (1752–1840) divided the human [[species]] into five [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] in 1779, later founded on crania research (description of human skulls), and called them (1793/1795):&lt;ref&gt;Blumenbach, J. F. 1779. ''Handbuch der Naturgeschichte'' vol. 1, pp. 63f. The names of Blumenbach's five groups are introduced in his 1795 revision of ''De generis humani varietate nativa'' (pp. 23f.) as ''Caucasiae, Mongolicae, Aethiopicae, Americanae, Malaicae''. 
see also: Kowner and Skott in: R. Kowner, W. Demel (eds.), ''Race and Racism in Modern East Asia: Interactions, Nationalism, Gender and Lineage'' (2015), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Caucasian race]]
* the [[Mongoloid|Mongolian race]]
* the [[Negroid|Aethiopian race]]
* the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American race]]
* the [[Malay race|Malayan race]]

Blumenbach's classification of the Mongolian race included all [[East Asian]]s and some [[Central Asian]]s as well as the Inuit (Eskimos) of the American arctic, excluding  peoples of Southeast Asian islands and Pacific Islanders, which were categorized in a separate Malayan race. Blumenbach's American race comprised most peoples of the Americas (excepting the polar region) and of the Caribbean.

Blumenbach argued that physical characteristics like skin color, cranial profile, etc., were depended on geography and nutrition and custom.
Blumenbach's work included his description of sixty [[Human cranium|human crania]] (skulls) published originally in fascicules as ''Decas craniorum'' (Göttingen, 1790–1828). This was a founding work for other scientists in the field of [[craniometry]].

Further anatomical study led him to the conclusion that 'individual Africans differ as much, or even more, from other individual Africans as Europeans differ from Europeans'. Furthermore, he concluded that Africans were not inferior to the rest of mankind 'concerning healthy faculties of understanding, excellent natural talents and mental capacities'.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Hitt, "Mighty White of You: Racial Preferences Color America's Oldest Skulls and Bones", ''Harper's'', July 2005, pp. 39–55&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Finally, I am of opinion that after all these numerous instances I have brought together of negroes of capacity, it would not be difficult to mention entire well-known provinces of Europe, from out of which you would not easily expect to obtain off-hand such good authors, poets, philosophers, and correspondents of the Paris Academy; and on the other hand, there is no so-called savage nation known under the sun which has so much distinguished itself by such examples of perfectibility and original capacity for scientific culture, and thereby attached itself so closely to the most civilized nations of the earth, as the Negro."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9QKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA312#PPA312|title=The Anthropological Treatises of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach ...|first1=Johann Friedrich|last1=Blumenbach|first2=Thomas|last2=Bendyshe|date=26 October 1865|publisher=Anthropological Society|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These five groups saw some continuity in the various classification schemes of the 19th century, in some cases augmented, e.g. by the [[Australoid race]]&lt;ref&gt;subsumed under "Aethiopian" ("black") by Blumenbach; introduced by [[Thomas Huxley]], ''On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind'' (1870).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Capoid race]]&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Coon, ''[[The Origin of Races]]'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; in some cases the Mongolian (East Asian) and American collapsed into a single group.

==Racial anthropology (1850–1930)==
{{Main|racial anthropology}}
{{further|biological anthropology}}
Among the 19th century naturalists who defined the field were [[Georges Cuvier]], [[James Cowles Pritchard]], [[Louis Agassiz]], [[Charles Pickering (naturalist)|Charles Pickering]] (''Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution'', 1848). Cuvier enumerated three races, Pritchard seven, Agassiz twelve, and Pickering eleven.

The 19th century saw attempts to change race from a taxonomic to a biological concept. For example, using [[anthropometrics]], invented by Francis Galton and [[Alphonse Bertillon]], they measured the shapes and sizes of skulls and related the results to group differences in intelligence or other attributes (Lieberman 2001).

These scientists made three claims about race: first, that races are objective, naturally occurring divisions of humanity; second, that there is a strong relationship between biological races and other human phenomena (such as [[forms of activity and interpersonal relations]] and culture, and by extension the relative [[materialism|material success]] of cultures), thus biologizing the notion of "race", as Foucault demonstrated in his historical analysis; third, that race is therefore a valid scientific category{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} that can be used to explain and predict individual and group behavior. Races were distinguished by [[human skin color|skin color]], [[facial type]], [[Human cranium|cranial]] profile and size, texture and color of hair. Moreover, races were almost universally considered to reflect group differences in moral character and [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].

Stefan Kuhl wrote that the [[eugenics]] movement rejected the racial and national hypotheses of [[Arthur Gobineau]] and his writing ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]''. According to Kuhl, the eugenicists believed that nations were political and cultural constructs, not race constructs, because nations were the result of race mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher=Springer | title=For the Betterment of the Race: The Rise and Fall of the International Movement for Eugenics and Racial Hygiene | author=Stefan Kühl| date=2013 | isbn=9781137286123 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=4T4hAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=An+Essay+on+the+Inequality+of+the+Human+Races+eugenics#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20Essay%20on%20the%20Inequality%20of%20the%20Human%20Races%20eugenics&amp;f=false | access-date=June 9, 2016 | quote=Eugenicist were clear that nations were political and cultural constructs, not race constructs. In this, they consciously turned away from the race theory of Arthur de Gobineau, who in an essay on the "Inequality of the Human Races", had claimed that a people's cultural assets and its ability to develop historically were determined by a people's "race substance". According to Gobineau, every "nation" is therefore the result of racially determined abilities and lack of abilities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vacher de Lapouge]]'s "anthroposociology", asserted as self-evident the biological inferiority of particular groups (Kevles 1985). In many parts of the world, the idea of race became a way of rigidly dividing groups by culture as well as by physical appearances (Hannaford 1996). Campaigns of oppression and [[genocide]] were often motivated by supposed racial differences (Horowitz 2001{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}).

During the late 19th century and early 20th century, the tension between some who believed in hierarchy and innate superiority, and others who believed in human equality, was at a paramount. The former continued to exacerbate the belief that certain races were innately inferior by examining their shortcomings, namely by examining and testing intelligence between groups. Some scientists claimed that there was a [[biological]] determinant of race by evaluating one's [[genes]] and [[DNA]]. Different methods of eugenics, the study and practice of human selective breeding often with a race as a primary concentration, was still widely accepted in Britain, Germany, and the United States.&lt;ref name="Sarich, Vincent 2004"&gt;Sarich, Vincent, and Miele Frank. Race: the Reality of Human Differences. Boulder: Westview Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many scientists understood race as a [[social construct]]. They believed that the [[phenotypical]] expression of an individual were determined by one's genes that are inherited through reproduction but there were certain social constructs, such as [[culture]], [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], and [[language]] that were primary in shaping behavioral characteristics. Some advocated that race 'should centre not on what race explains about society, but rather on the questions of who, why and with what effect social significance is attached to racial attributes that are constructed in particular political and socio-economic contexts', and thus, addressing the "folk" or "mythological representations" of race.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Les, and Solomos John. Theories of Race and  Racism: A Reader. New York: Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louis Agassiz's racial definitions===
After [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807–1873) traveled to the United States, he became a prolific writer in what has been later termed the genre of scientific racism. Agassiz was specifically a believer and advocate in [[polygenism]], that races came from separate origins (specifically separate creations), were endowed with unequal attributes, and could be classified into specific climatic zones, in the same way he felt other animals and plants could be classified.

These included Western American Temperate (the indigenous peoples west of the Rockies); Eastern American Temperate (east of the Rockies); Tropical Asiatic (south of the Himalayas); Temperate Asiatic (east of the Urals and north of the Himalayas); South American Temperate (South America); New Holland (Australia); Arctic (Alaska and Arctic Canada); Cape of Good Hope (South Africa); and American Tropical (Central America and the West Indies).

Agassiz denied that species originated in single pairs, whether at a single location or at many. He argued instead multiple individuals in each species were created at the same time and then distributed throughout the continents where God meant for them to dwell. His lectures on polygenism were popular among the slaveholders in the South, for many this opinion legitimized the belief in a lower standard of the Negro.

His stance in this case was considered to be quite radical in its time, because it went against the more orthodox and standard reading of the Bible in his time which implied all human stock descended from a single couple (Adam and Eve), and in his defense Agassiz often used what now sounds like a very "modern" argument about the need for independence between science and religion; though Agassiz, unlike many polygeneticists, maintained his religious beliefs and was not anti-Biblical in general.

In the context of ethnology and anthropology of the mid-19th century, Agassiz's polygenetic views became explicitly seen as opposing Darwin's views on race, which sought to show the common origin of all human races and the superficiality of racial differences. Darwin's second book on evolution, The Descent of Man, features extensive argumentation addressing the single origin of the races, at times explicitly opposing Agassiz's theories.

===Arthur de Gobineau===
[[File:Arthur de Gobineau.jpg|thumb|Gobineau in 1876]]
[[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1816–1882) was a successful diplomat for the [[French Second Empire]]. Initially he was posted to Persia, before working in Brazil and other countries. He came to believe that race created culture, arguing that distinctions between the three "black", "white", and "yellow" races were natural barriers, and that "race-mixing" breaks those barriers and leads to chaos. He classified the Middle East, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, North Africa, and southern France as racially mixed.

Gobineau believed the white race was superior to the others. He thought it corresponded to the ancient Indo-European culture, also known as "[[Aryan]]". Gobineau originally wrote that white race miscegenation was inevitable. He attributed much of the economic turmoils in France to pollution of races. Later on in his life, he altered his opinion to believe that the white race could be saved.

To Gobineau, the development of empires was ultimately destructive to the "superior races" that created them, since they led to the mixing of distinct races. This he saw as a degenerative process.

According to his definitions, the people of Spain, most of France, most of Germany, southern and western Iran as well as Switzerland, Austria, northern Italy, and a large part of Britain, consisted of a degenerative race arising from miscegenation. Also according to him, the whole of north India consisted of a yellow race.

Huxley states: 'It is to the Xanthochroi and Melanochroi, taken together, that the absurd denomination of "Caucasian" is usually applied'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley, T. H.]] [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/SM3/GeoDis.html "On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind"] (1870) ''Journal of the Ethnological Society of London''&lt;/ref&gt; He also indicates that he has omitted certain areas with complex ethnic compositions that do not fit into his racial paradigm, including much of the Horn of Africa and the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=Huxley1873/&gt; Huxley's Melanochroi eventually comprised various other dark Caucasoid populations, including the Hamites and Moors.&lt;ref name="JWGregory"/&gt;]]

[[Thomas Huxley]] (1825 –1895) wrote one paper, "On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind" (1870), in which he proposed a distinction within the human species ('races'), and their distribution across the earth. He also acknowledged that certain geographical areas with more complex ethnic compositions, including much of the Horn of Africa and the India subcontinent, did not fit into his racial paradigm. As such, he noted that: "I have purposely omitted such people as the Abyssinians and the Hindoos, who there is every reason to believe result from the intermixture of distinct stocks."&lt;ref name=Huxley1873&gt;{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Thomas|title=Critiques and Addresses by Thomas Henry Huxley, LL.D., F.R.S|year=1873|publisher=Macmillan and Company|page=153|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=V8cArGfZfNgC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late nineteenth century, Huxley's Xanthochroi group had been redefined as the [[Nordic race]], whereas his Melanochroi became the [[Mediterranean race]]. His Melanochroi thus eventually also comprised various other dark Caucasoid populations, including the [[Hamitic|Hamites]] (e.g. Berbers, Somalis, northern Sudanese, ancient Egyptians) and [[Moors]].&lt;ref name="JWGregory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=John Walter|title=Race as a Political Factor|date=1931|publisher=Watts &amp; Company|page=19|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=uU8oAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's paper was rejected by the [[Royal Society]], and this became one of the many theories to be advanced and dropped by the early exponents of [[evolution]].

Despite rejection by Huxley and the science community, the paper is sometimes cited in support of racialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Di Gregorio | first=Mario A | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=T.H. Huxley's place in natural science | publisher= | year=1984 | location=New Haven | pages= | url= | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Darwin, Huxley was a monogenist, the belief that all humans are part of the same species, with morphological variations emerging out of an initial uniformity. (Stepan, p.&amp;nbsp;44). This view contrasts polygenism, the theory that each race is actually a separate species with separate sites of origin.

Despite Huxley's monogenism and his abolitionism on ethical grounds, Huxley assumed a hierarchy of innate abilities, a stance evinced in papers such as "Emancipation Black and White" and his most famous paper, "Evolution and Ethics".

In the former, he writes that the "highest places in the hierarchy of civilization will assuredly not be within the reach of our dusky cousins, though it is by no means necessary that they should be restricted to the lowest". (Stepan, p.&amp;nbsp;79–80).

===Charles Darwin and race===
Though [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolutionary theory was set forth in 1859 upon publication of ''On the Origin of Species'', this work was largely absent of explicit reference to Darwin’s theory applied to man. This application by Darwin would not become explicit until 1871 with the publication of his second great book on evolution, ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]''.

Darwin's publication of this book occurred within the heated debates between advocates of monogeny, who held that all races came from a common ancestor, and advocates of polygeny, who held that the races were separately created. Darwin, who had come from a family with strong abolitionist ties, had experienced and was disturbed by cultures of slavery during his voyage on the Beagle years earlier. Noted Darwin biographers [[Adrian Desmond]] and [[James Moore (biographer)|James Moore]] argue that Darwin's writings on evolution were not only influenced by his abolitionist tendencies, but also his belief that non-white races were equal in regard to their intellectual capacity as white races, a belief which had been strongly disputed by scientists such as Morton, Agassiz and Broca, all noted polygenists.

By the late 1860s, however, Darwin's theory of evolution had been thought to be compatible with the polygenist thesis (Stepan 1982). Darwin thus used ''Descent of Man'' to disprove the polygenist thesis and end the debate between polygeny and monogeny once and for all. Darwin also used it to disprove other hypotheses about racial difference that had persisted since the time of ancient Greece, for example, that differences in skin color and body constitution occurred because of differences of geography and climate.

Darwin concluded, for example, that the biological similarities between the different races were "too great" for the polygenist thesis to be plausible. He also used the idea of races to argue for the continuity between humans and animals, noting that it would be highly implausible that man should, by mere accident acquire characteristics shared by many apes.

Darwin sought to demonstrate that the physical characteristics that were being used to define race for centuries (i.e. skin color and facial features) were superficial and had no utility for survival. Because, according to Darwin, any characteristic that did not have survival value could not have been naturally selected, he devised another hypothesis for the development and persistence of these characteristics. The mechanism Darwin developed is known as [[sexual selection]].

Though the idea of sexual selection had appeared in earlier works by Darwin, it was not until the late 1860s when it received full consideration (Stepan 1982). Furthermore, it was not until 1914 that sexual selection received serious consideration as a racial theory by naturalist thinkers.

Darwin defined sexual selection as the "struggle between individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex". Sexual selection consisted of two types for Darwin: 1.) The physical struggle for a mate, and 2.) The preference for some color or another, typically by females of a given species. Darwin asserted that the differing human races (insofar as race was conceived phenotypically) had arbitrary standards of ideal beauty, and that these standards reflected important physical characteristics sought in mates.

Broadly speaking, Darwin's attitudes of what race was and how it developed in the human species are attributable to two assertions, 1.) That all human beings, regardless of race share a single, common ancestor and 2.) Phenotypic racial differences are superficially selected, and have no survival value.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Given these two beliefs, some believe Darwin to have established monogenism as the dominant paradigm for racial ancestry, and to have defeated the scientific racism practiced by Morton, Knott, Agassiz et. Al, as well as notions that there existed a natural racial hierarchy that reflected inborn differences and measures of value between the different human races.
Nevertheless, he stated: "The various races, when carefully compared and measured, differ much from each other – as in the texture of hair, the relative proportions of all parts of the body, the capacity of the lungs, the form and capacity of the skull, and even the convolutions of the brain. But it would be an endless task to specify the numerous points of difference. The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatization and in liability to certain diseases. Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotion, but partly in their intellectual faculties." (''The Descent of Man'', chapter VII).

In ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin noted the great difficulty naturalists had in trying to decide how many "races" there actually were:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Man has been studied more carefully than any other animal, and yet there is the greatest possible diversity amongst capable judges whether he should be classed as a single species or race, or as two (Virey), as three (Jacquinot), as four (Kant), five (Blumenbach), six (Buffon), seven (Hunter), eight (Agassiz), eleven (Pickering), fifteen (Bory St. Vincent), sixteen (Desmoulins), twenty-two (Morton), sixty (Crawfurd), or as sixty-three, according to Burke. This diversity of judgment does not prove that the races ought not to be ranked as species, but it shews that they graduate into each other, and that it is hardly possible to discover clear distinctive characters between them.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Decline of racial studies after 1930==
Several social and political developments that occurred at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century led to the transformation in the discourse of race. Three movements that historians have considered are: the coming of mass [[democracy]], the age of [[Imperialism|imperialist expansion]], and the impact of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="Malik, Kenan 1996"&gt;Malik, Kenan. The Meaning of Race. New York: New York University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; More than any other, the violence of [[Nazi]] rule, the [[Holocaust]], and [[World War II]] transformed the whole discussion of race. Nazism made an argument for racial superiority based on a biological basis. This led to the idea that people could be divided into discrete groups and based on the divisions, there would be severe, tortuous, and often fatal consequence. The exposition of racial theory beginning in the [[Third Reich]], up to the [[Final Solution]], created a popular moral revolution against racism.&lt;ref name="Malik, Kenan 1996"/&gt; In 1950, and as a response to the genocide of Nazism, UNESCO was formed and released a statement saying that there was no biological determinant or basis for race.

Consequently, studies of human variation focused more on actual patterns of variation and evolutionary patterns among populations and less about classification. Some scientists point to three discoveries. Firstly, African populations exhibit greater genetic diversity and less linkage disequilibrium because of their long history. Secondly, genetic similarity is directly correlated with geographic proximity. Lastly, some loci reflect selection in response to environmental gradients. Therefore, some argue, human racial groups do not appear to be distinct ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig, Barbara A., Lee Sandra Soo-Jin, and Richardson Sarah S. Revisiting Race in a Genomic Age. Piscataway: Rutgers University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franz Boas===
[[Franz Boas]] (1858–1942) was a German American anthropologist and has been called the "Father of American Anthropology". Boas made significant contributions within [[anthropology]], more specifically, [[physical anthropology]], [[linguistics]], [[archaeology]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. His work put an emphasis on cultural and environmental effects on people to explain their development into adulthood and evaluated them in concert with human biology and evolution. This encouraged academics to break away from static taxonomical classifications of race. It is said that before Boas, anthropology was the study of race, and after Boas, anthropology was the study of culture.

===Julian Huxley and A. C. Haddon===
[[Sir Julian Sorell Huxley]] (1887–1975) was an English evolutionary biologist, humanist and internationalist. After returning to England from a tour of the United States in 1924, Huxley wrote a series of articles for the ''Spectator'' which he expressed his belief in the drastic differences between "negros" and "whites".&lt;ref name="Barkan, Elazar 1992"&gt;Barkan, Elazar. The Retreat of Scientific Racism. New York: Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the color of "blood" – percentage of 'white' and 'black' blood – that a person had would determine a person's mental capacity, moral probity, and social behavior. "Blood" also determined how individuals should be treated by society. He was a proponent of racial inequality and segregation.&lt;ref name="Malik, Kenan 1996"/&gt;

By 1930, Huxley's ideas on race and inherited intellectual capacity of human groups became more liberal. By the mid-1930s, Huxley was considered one of the leading [[Anti-racism|antiracist]] and committed much of his time and efforts into publicizing the fight against Nazism.&lt;ref name="Barkan, Elazar 1992"/&gt;

[[Alfred Cort Haddon]] (1855–1940) was a British anthropologist and ethnologist.

In 1935, Huxley and A. C. Haddon wrote, ''We Europeans'', which greatly popularized the struggle against racial science and attacked the Nazis' abuse of science to promote their racial theories. Although they argued that 'any biological arrangement of the types of European man is still largely a subjective process', they proposed that humankind could be divided up into "major" and "minor subspecies". They believed that races were a classification based on [[hereditary]] traits but should not by nature be used to condemn or deem inferior to another group. Like most of their peers, they continued to maintain a distinction between the social meaning of race and the scientific study of race. From a scientific stand point, they were willing to accept that concepts of superiority and inferiority did not exist, but from a social stand point, they continued to believe that racial differences were significant. For example, they argued that genetic differences between groups were functionally important for certain jobs or tasks.&lt;ref name="Malik, Kenan 1996"/&gt;

[[Carleton Stevens Coon]] (1904–1981) was an American [[biological anthropology|physical anthropologist]], Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], lecturer and professor at [[Harvard]], and president of the [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collopy.net/projects/2009/race.html|title={{"'}}Race' Relations: Montagu, Dobzhansky, Coon, and the Divergence of Race Concepts"|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723045713/http://collopy.net/projects/2009/race.html|archivedate=2011-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Coon published ''[[The Races of Europe (Coon)|The Races of Europe]]'', in which he concluded:&lt;ref name=racesofeurope&gt;[http://www.snpa.nordish.net/racesofeurope.htm The Races of Europe by Carleton Coon 1939] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20050225133107/http://www.snpa.nordish.net/racesofeurope.htm |date=2005-02-25 }} (Hosted by the Society for Nordish Physical Anthropology)&lt;/ref&gt;

#The Upper Paleolithic peoples are the truly indigenous peoples of Europe.
#Mediterraneans invaded Europe in large numbers during the Neolithic period and settled there.
#The racial situation in Europe today may be explained as a mixture of Upper Paleolithic survivors and Mediterraneans.
#When reduced Upper Paleolithic survivors and Mediterraneans mix, then occurs the process of [[dinaric race|dinarization]], which produces a hybrid with non-intermediate features.
#The Caucasian race encompasses the regions of [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], the [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]].
#The Nordic race is part of the Mediterranean racial stock, being a mixture of Corded and Danubian Mediterraneans.

In 1962, Coon also published ''The Origin of Races'', wherein he offered a definitive statement of the [[polygenist]] view. He also argued that human fossils could be assigned a date, a race, and an evolutionary grade. Coon divided humanity into five races and believed that each race had ascended the ladder of human evolution at different rates.&lt;ref name="Sarich, Vincent 2004"/&gt;

===Ashley Montagu===
[[Ashley Montagu|Montague Francis Ashley Montagu]] (1905–1999) was a British-American anthropologist. In 1942, he made a strong effort to have the word "race" replaced with "[[ethnic group]]" by publishing his book, ''Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race''. He was also selected to draft the initial 1950 UNESCO Statement on Race.&lt;ref name="Sarich, Vincent 2004"/&gt;

Montagu would later publish ''An Introduction to Physical Anthropology'', a comprehensive treatise on human diversity. In doing so, he sought to provide a firmer scientific framework through which to discuss biological variation among populations.&lt;ref name=Montagu&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashley|first=Montagu|title=An Introduction to Physical Anthropology - Second Edition|date=1951|publisher=Charles C.

=== UNESCO ===
{{Main|The Race Question}}
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) was established November 16, 1945, in the wake of the genocide of Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sack (1986) Unesco: From Inherent Contradictions to Open Crisis, ''Comparative Education Review'', Vol. 30, No. 1 (Feb. 1986), pp. 112–19&lt;/ref&gt; The UNESCO 1945 constitution declared that, "The great and terrible war which now has ended was made possible by the denial of the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men, and by the propagation, in their place, through ignorance and prejudice, of the doctrine of the inequality of men and races."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15244&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=UNESCO Constitution|website=portal.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1978 the UNESCO issued five statements on the issue of race.

The first of the UNESCO statements on race was "[[The Race Question]]" and was issued on July 18, 1950. The statement included both a rejection of a scientific basis for theories of racial hierarchies and a moral [[anti-racism|condemnation of racism]]. Its first statement suggested in particular to "drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of '[[ethnic groups]]{{'"}}, which proved to be controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Barkan, Elazar.

It did not reject the idea of a biological basis to racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Banton. Michael|chapter=Race, Unesco statements on |editor=Schaefer, Richard T. (ed.)|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|publisher=Sage |isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|quote=The statement was primarily concerned with the use of race in the sense of species, but in referring to "the biological fact of race", it touched on the use of the word to signify inheritance.|page=1096 or 1098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead it defined the concept of race in terms as a population defined by certain anatomical and physiological characteristics as being divergent from other populations; it gives the examples of the [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], [[Mongoloid race|Mongoloid]] and [[Negroid race|Negroid]] races. The statements maintain that there are no "pure races" and that biological variability was as great within any race as between races. It argued that there is no scientific basis for believing that there are any innate differences in intellectual, psychological or emotional potential among races.

The statement was drafted by [[Ashley Montagu]] and endorsed by some of the leading researchers of the time, in the fields of [[psychology]], [[biology]], [[cultural anthropology]] and [[ethnology]]. The statement was endorsed by [[Ernest Beaglehole]], [[Juan Comas]], L. A. Costa Pinto, [[Franklin Frazier]], sociologist specialised in race relations studies, [[Morris Ginsberg]], founding chairperson of the [[British Sociological Association]], [[Humayun Kabir]], writer, philosopher and Education Minister of India twice, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], one of the founders of [[ethnology]] and leading theorist of [[structural anthropology]], and [[Ashley Montagu]], anthropologist and author of ''[[Joseph Merrick|The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity]]'', who was the [[wikt:rapporteur|rapporteur]].

As a result of a lack of representation of [[Physical anthropology|physical anthropologists]] in the drafting committee the 1950 publication was criticized by biologists and physical anthropologists for confusing the biological and social senses of race and for going beyond the scientific facts, although there was a general agreement about the statements conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Banton. Michael|chapter=Race, Unesco statements on |editor=Schaefer, Richard T. (ed.)|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|quote=Because of last-minute withdrawals, biological science was not adequately represented in the committee. Many biologists, though not rejecting the statement's general spirit or its main conclusions, believed that it went beyond the scientific facts (e.g., in the reference to “drives towards co-operation”) and that it confused the biological and social uses of the word race.|page=1096 or 1098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCO assembled a new committee with better representation of the physical sciences and drafted a new statement released in 1951. The 1951 statement, published as "[[The Race Concept]]", focused on race as a biological heuristic that could serve as the basis for evolutionary studies of human populations. It considered the existing races to be the result of such evolutionary processes throughout human history. It also maintained that "equality of opportunity and equality in law in no way depend, as ethical principles, upon the assertion that human beings are in fact equal in endowment."

As the 1950 and 1951 statements generated considerable attention, in 1964 a new commission was formed to draft a third statement titled "[[Proposals on the Biological Aspects of Race]]". According to [[Michael Banton]] (2008), this statement broke more clearly with the notion of race-as-species than the previous two statements, declaring that almost any genetically differentiated population could be defined as a race.&lt;ref name="Banton. Michael 2008 1096"&gt;{{cite book|author=Banton. Michael|chapter=Race, Unesco statements on |editor=Schaefer, Richard T. (ed.)|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|publisher=Sage |isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|page=1096 or 1099}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement stated that "Different classifications of mankind into major stocks, and of those into more restricted categories (races, which are groups of populations, or single populations) have been proposed on the basis of hereditary physical traits. Nearly all classifications recognise at least three major stocks" and "There is no national, religious, geographic, linguistic or cultural group which constitutes a race ipso facto; the concept of race is purely biological." It concluded with "The biological data given above stand in open contradiction to the tenets of racism. Racist theories can in no way pretend to have any scientific foundation."

The 1950, '51 and '64 statements focused on the dispelling the scientific foundations for racism but did not consider other factors contributing to racism. For this reason, in 1967 a new committee was assembled, including representatives of the social sciences (sociologists, lawyers, ethnographers and geneticists), to draft a statement "covering the social, ethical and philosophical aspects of the problem". This statement was the first to provide a definition of [[racism]]: "antisocial beliefs and acts which are based upon the fallacy that discriminatory intergroup relations are justifiable on biological grounds". The statement continued to denounce the many negative social affects of racism.&lt;ref name="Banton. Michael 2008 1096"/&gt;

In 1978 the general assembly of the UNESCO considered the four previous statements and published a collective "[[Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/webworld/peace_library/UNESCO/HRIGHTS/107-116.HTM|title=DECLARATION ON RACE AND RACIAL PREJUDICE, 1978|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration included [[Apartheid]] as one of the examples of racism, an inclusion which caused [[South Africa]] to step out of the assembly. It declared that a number of public policies and laws needed to be implemented. It stated that:
* "All human beings belong to a single species."
:*"All peoples of the world possess equal faculties for attaining the highest level in intellectual, technical, social, economic, cultural and political development."
:*"The differences between the achievements of the different peoples are entirely attributable to geographical, historical, political, economic, social and cultural factors."
:*"Any theory which involves the claim that racial or ethnic groups are inherently superior or inferior, thus implying that some would be entitled to dominate and eliminate others, presumed to be inferior, or which bases value judgements on racial differentiation, has no scientific foundation and is contrary to the moral and ethical principles of humanity."

===Criticism of racial studies (1930s–1980s)===
{{cleanup section|reason=more or less random compilation of comments from the period (as opposed to a coherent summary of the academic development during these five decades)|date=July 2015}}
{{further|The Mismeasure of Man|Lewontin's fallacy|Blank-slatism|Anti-racism#Revival in the United States}}

The 20th-century criticism of racial anthropology were significantly based on the school of [[Franz Boas]], professor of anthropology at Columbia University from 1899, who beginning in 1920 strongly favoured the influence of social environment over heritability. As a reaction to the rise of [[Nazi Germany]] and its prominent espousing of [[Nazism and race|racist ideologies]] in the 1930s, there was an outpouring of popular works by scientists criticizing the use of race to justify the politics of "superiority" and "inferiority". An influential work in this regard was the publication of ''We Europeans: A Survey of "Racial" Problems'' by [[Julian Huxley]] and [[A. C. Haddon]] in 1935, which sought to show that [[population genetics]] allowed for only a highly limited definition of race at best. Another popular work during this period, "The Races of Mankind" by [[Ruth Benedict]] and Gene Weltfish, argued that though there were some extreme racial differences, they were primarily superficial, and in any case did not justify political action.

[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' ''Race and History'' ([[UNESCO]], 1952) was another critique of the biological "race" notion, arguing in favor of [[cultural relativism]] through a metaphor of cultures as different trains crossing each other in various directions and speed, thus each one seeming to [[wikt:progress|progress]] to himself while others supposedly kept immobile. This, in his view, clearly showed that "race" was no longer a useful indicator of cultural superiority.

In his 1984 article in the ''Essence'' magazine, "On Being 'White' ... and Other Lies",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cwsworkshop.org/pdfs/CARC/Family_Herstories/2_On_Being_White.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Baldwin]] reads the history of [[racialization]] in America as both figuratively and literally violent, remarking that "race" only exists as a social construction within a network of force relations: "America became white&amp;nbsp;— the people who, as they claim, 'settled' the country became white&amp;nbsp;— because of the necessity of denying the Black presence, and justifying the Black subjugation. No community can be based on such a principle&amp;nbsp;— or, in other words, no community can be established on so genocidal a lie. White men from Norway, for example, where they were Norwegians&amp;nbsp;— became white: by slaughtering the cattle, poisoning the well, torching the houses, massacring Native Americans, raping Black women.... Because they are white, they cannot allow themselves to be tormented by the suspicion that all men are brothers."

Apart from its function as a vernacular term, the term "race"&amp;nbsp;– as Nancy Stepan notes in her 1982 book, ''The Idea of Race in Science, Great Britain 1800–1960''&amp;nbsp;– varied widely in its usage, even in science, from the 18th century through the 20th; the term referred "at one time or another" to "cultural, religious, national, linguistic, ethnic and geographical groups of human beings"&amp;nbsp;— everything from "Celts" to "Spanish Americans" to "Hottentots" to "Europeans" (p.&amp;nbsp;xvii).

In the 1979 preface to ''Blackness: Text and Pretext'', [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], describes the elusive element of "blackness" in Afro-American literature as lacking an "essence", defined instead "by a network of relations that form a particular aesthetic unity" (p.&amp;nbsp;162). Continuing his poststructuralist-inflected negation of blackness as an essence, in his 1985 introduction to a special issue of the journal ''Critical Inquiry'', Gates goes even further, calling race itself a "dangerous trope" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). He argues that "race has become a trope of the ultimate, irreducible difference between cultures, linguistic groups, or adherents of specific belief systems which&amp;nbsp;— more often than not&amp;nbsp;— also have fundamentally opposed economic interests" (p.&amp;nbsp;5).

[[Linda Gottfredson]], on the other hand, has argued that denying (or trying to conceal) real biological differences between groups on average IQ instead cause people to seek something to blame for the differing average group achievements, causing resentment and hostility. She argues that "virtually all the victim groups of [[genocide]] in the Twentieth Century had relatively ''high'' average levels of achievement."&lt;ref name=G2005&gt;What if the Hereditarian Hypothesis Is True?

[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (1/ε = ω/1)]]

The system of '''hyperreal numbers''' is a way of treating [[Infinity|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal]] quantities.  The hyperreals, or '''nonstandard reals''', *'''R''', are an [[Field extension|extension]] of the [[real number]]s '''R''' that contains numbers greater than anything of the form

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 &lt;/math&gt; (for any finite number of terms).

Such numbers are infinite, and their [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s are [[infinitesimal]]s.  The term "hyper-real" was introduced by [[Edwin Hewitt]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (1948), p.&amp;nbsp;74, as reported in Keisler (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

The hyperreal numbers satisfy the [[transfer principle]], a rigorous version of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] heuristic [[Law of Continuity]].  The transfer principle states that true [[first-order logic|first order]] statements about '''R''' are also valid in *'''R'''. For example, the commutative law of addition, ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'', holds for the hyperreals just as it does for the reals; since '''R''' is a [[real closed field]], so is *'''R'''.  Since &lt;math&gt;\sin({\pi n})=0&lt;/math&gt; for all integers ''n'', one also has &lt;math&gt;\sin({\pi H})=0&lt;/math&gt; for all [[hyperinteger]]s ''H''.  The transfer principle for [[ultrapower]]s is a consequence of [[Łoś' theorem]] of 1955.

Concerns about the [[soundness]] of arguments involving infinitesimals date back to ancient Greek mathematics, with [[Archimedes]] replacing such proofs with ones using other techniques such as the [[method of exhaustion]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] proved that the hyperreals were logically consistent if and only if the reals were. This put to rest the fear that any proof involving infinitesimals might be unsound, provided that they were manipulated according to the logical rules that Robinson delineated.

The application of hyperreal numbers and in particular the transfer principle to problems of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] is called [[non-standard analysis]]. One immediate application is the definition of the basic concepts of analysis such as derivative and integral in a direct fashion, without passing via logical complications of multiple quantifiers.  Thus, the derivative of ''f(x)'' becomes &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = {\rm st}\left( \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x} \right)&lt;/math&gt; for an infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, where ''st(&amp;middot;)'' denotes the [[standard part function]], which "rounds off" each finite hyperreal to the nearest real.  Similarly, the integral is defined as the standard part of a suitable infinite sum.

==The transfer principle==
{{Main|Transfer principle}}
The idea of the hyperreal system is to extend the real numbers '''R''' to form a system *'''R''' that includes infinitesimal and infinite numbers, but without changing any of the elementary axioms of algebra. Any statement of the form "for any number x..." that is true for the reals is also true for the hyperreals. For example, the axiom that states "for any number ''x'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''" still applies. The same is true for [[quantification (logic)|quantification]] over several numbers, e.g., "for any numbers ''x'' and ''y'', ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''yx''." This ability to carry over statements from the reals to the hyperreals is called the [[transfer principle]]. However, statements of the form "for any ''set'' of numbers S ..." may not carry over. The only properties that differ between the reals and the hyperreals are those that rely on quantification over sets, or other higher-level structures such as functions and relations, which are typically constructed out of sets. Each real set, function, and relation has its natural hyperreal extension, satisfying the same first-order properties.  The kinds of logical sentences that obey this restriction on quantification are referred to as statements in [[first-order logic]].

The transfer principle, however, doesn't mean that '''R''' and *'''R''' have identical behavior. For instance, in *'''R''' there exists an element ''&amp;omega;'' such that

: &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1+1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1+1+1&lt;\omega, \ldots. &lt;/math&gt;

but there is no such number in '''R'''. (In other words, *'''R''' is not [[Archimedean property|Archimedean]].) This is possible because the nonexistence of ''&amp;omega;'' cannot be expressed as a first order statement.

==Use in analysis==

===Calculus with algebraic functions===
Informal notations for non-real quantities have historically appeared in calculus in two contexts: as infinitesimals like ''dx'' and as the symbol ∞, used, for example, in limits of integration of [[improper integrals]].

As an example of the transfer principle, the statement that for any nonzero number ''x'', ''2x''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''x'', is true for the real numbers, and it is in the form required by the transfer principle, so it is also true for the hyperreal numbers. This shows that it is not possible to use a generic symbol such as ∞ for all the infinite quantities in the hyperreal system; infinite quantities differ in magnitude from other infinite quantities, and infinitesimals from other infinitesimals.

Similarly, the casual use of 1/0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞ is invalid, since the transfer principle applies to the statement that division by zero is undefined. The rigorous counterpart of such a calculation would be that if ε is a non-zero infinitesimal, then 1/ε is infinite.

For any finite hyperreal number ''x'', its [[standard part]], st ''x'', is defined as the unique real number that differs from it only infinitesimally. The derivative of a function ''y''(''x'') is defined not as ''dy/dx'' but as the standard part of ''dy/dx''.

For example, to find the [[derivative]] ''f&amp;prime;''(''x'') of the [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, let ''dx'' be a non-zero infinitesimal. Then,

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{f(x + dx) - f(x)}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{x^2 + 2x \cdot dx + (dx)^2 -x^2}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{2x \cdot dx +  (dx)^2}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{2x \cdot dx}{dx} + \frac{(dx)^2}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(2x + dx\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=2x&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The use of the standard part in the definition of the derivative is a rigorous alternative to the traditional practice of neglecting the square {{Citation needed|reason=if dx got to zero in limit then dx square go there too and doing this faster, this is rigorous|date=February 2018}} of an infinitesimal quantity. [[Dual number]]s are a number system based this idea. After the third line of the differentiation above, the typical method from Newton through the 19th century would have been simply to discard the ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; term. In the hyperreal system,
''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, since ''dx'' is nonzero, and the transfer principle can be applied to the statement that the square of any nonzero number is nonzero. However, the quantity ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  is infinitesimally small compared to ''dx''; that is, the hyperreal system contains a hierarchy of infinitesimal quantities.

===Integration===
One way of defining a definite integral in the hyperreal system is as the standard part of an infinite sum on a hyperfinite lattice defined as ''a'',&amp;nbsp;''a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;dx'',&amp;nbsp;''a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2dx'', ... ''a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ndx'', where ''dx'' is infinitesimal, n is an infinite [[hypernatural]], and the lower and upper bounds of integration are ''a'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;''dx.''&lt;ref&gt;Keisler&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The hyperreals *'''R''' form an [[ordered field]] containing the reals '''R''' as a subfield. Unlike the reals, the hyperreals do not form a standard [[metric space]], but by virtue of their order they carry an [[order topology]].

The use of the definite article ''the'' in the phrase ''the hyperreal numbers'' is somewhat misleading in that there is not a unique ordered field that is referred to in most treatments.
However, a 2003 paper by [[Vladimir Kanovei]] and [[Saharon Shelah]]&lt;ref name=kanovei2003&gt;{{Citation | last1=Kanovei|first1=Vladimir| last2=Shelah|first2=Saharon| title=A definable nonstandard model of the reals| url=http://shelah.logic.at/files/825.pdf| journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=69|year=2004| pages=159–164 | doi=10.2178/jsl/1080938834|arxiv=math/0311165}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that there is a definable, countably [[saturated model|saturated]] (meaning [[ω-saturated]], but not, of course, countable) [[elementary substructure|elementary extension]] of the reals, which therefore has a good claim to the title of ''the'' hyperreal numbers.  Furthermore, the field obtained by the ultrapower construction from the space of all real sequences, is unique up to isomorphism if one assumes the [[continuum hypothesis]].

The condition of being a hyperreal field is a stronger one than that of being a [[real closed field]] strictly containing '''R'''. It is also stronger than that of being a [[superreal field]] in the sense of Dales and [[W. Hugh Woodin|Woodin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Woodin | first1=W. H. | last2=Dales | first2=H. G. | title=Super-real fields: totally ordered fields with additional structure | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | isbn=978-0-19-853991-9 | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The hyperreals can be developed either axiomatically or by more constructively oriented methods. The essence of the axiomatic approach is to assert (1) the existence of at least one infinitesimal number, and (2) the validity of the transfer principle. In the following subsection we give a detailed outline of a more constructive approach. This method allows one to construct the hyperreals if given a set-theoretic object called an [[ultrafilter]], but the ultrafilter itself cannot be explicitly constructed.

===From Leibniz to Robinson===
When [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and (more explicitly) [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] introduced differentials, they used infinitesimals and these were still regarded as useful by later mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]. Nonetheless these concepts were from the beginning seen as suspect, notably by [[George Berkeley]].  Berkeley's criticism centered on a perceived shift in hypothesis in the definition of the derivative in terms of infinitesimals (or fluxions), where ''dx'' is assumed to be nonzero at the beginning of the calculation, and to vanish at its conclusion (see [[Ghosts of departed quantities]] for details).  When in the 1800s [[calculus]] was put on a firm footing through the development of the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] by [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]], Cauchy, [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], and others, infinitesimals were largely abandoned, though research in [[non-Archimedean field]]s continued (Ehrlich 2006).

However, in the 1960s [[Abraham Robinson]] showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of [[non-standard analysis]].&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;{{Citation | last1=Robinson | first1=Abraham | author1-link=Abraham Robinson | title=Non-standard analysis | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | isbn=978-0-691-04490-3 | year=1996}}. The classic introduction to nonstandard analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson developed his theory [[Constructive_proof#Non-constructive_proofs|nonconstructively]], using [[model theory]]; however it is possible to proceed using only [[algebra]] and [[topology]], and proving the transfer principle as a consequence of the definitions. In other words hyperreal numbers ''per se'', aside from their use in nonstandard analysis, have no necessary relationship to model theory or first order logic, although they were discovered by the application of model theoretic techniques from logic.  Hyper-real fields were in fact originally introduced by Hewitt (1948) by purely algebraic techniques, using an ultrapower construction.

===The ultrapower construction===

We are going to construct a hyperreal field via [[sequence]]s of reals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Loeb | first1=Peter A. | title=Nonstandard analysis for the working mathematician | publisher=Kluwer Acad. Publ. | location=Dordrecht | series=Math. Appl. | year=2000 | volume=510 | chapter=An introduction to nonstandard analysis | pages=1–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact we can add and multiply sequences componentwise; for example:

:&lt;math&gt; (a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots) + (b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots) = (a_0 +b_0, a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2, \ldots) &lt;/math&gt;

and analogously for multiplication.
This turns the set of such sequences into a [[commutative ring]], which is in fact a real [[algebra over a field|algebra]] '''A'''. We have a natural embedding of '''R''' in '''A''' by identifying the real number ''r'' with the sequence (''r'', ''r'', ''r'', …) and this identification preserves the corresponding algebraic operations of the reals. The intuitive motivation is, for example, to represent an infinitesimal number using a sequence that approaches zero. The inverse of such a sequence would represent an infinite number. As we will see below, the difficulties arise because of the need to define rules for comparing such sequences in a manner that, although inevitably somewhat arbitrary, must be self-consistent and well defined. For example, we may have two sequences that differ in their first ''n'' members, but are equal after that; such sequences should clearly be considered as representing the same hyperreal number. Similarly, most sequences oscillate randomly forever, and we must find some way of taking such a sequence and interpreting it as, say, &lt;math&gt;7+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a certain infinitesimal number.

Comparing sequences is thus a delicate matter. We could, for example, try to define a relation between sequences in a componentwise fashion:

:&lt;math&gt; (a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots) \leq (b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots) \iff  (a_0 \leq b_0) \wedge (a_1 \leq b_1) \wedge (a_2 \leq b_2) \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

but here we run into trouble, since some entries of the first sequence may be bigger than the corresponding entries of the second sequence, and some others may be smaller.   It follows that the relation defined in this way is only a [[partial order]].  To get around this, we have to specify which positions matter. Since there are infinitely many indices, we don't want finite sets of indices to matter. A consistent choice of index sets that matter is given by any free [[ultrafilter]] ''U'' on the [[natural number]]s; these can be characterized as ultrafilters that do not contain any finite sets. (The good news is that [[Zorn's lemma]] guarantees the existence of many such ''U''; the bad news is that they cannot be explicitly constructed.) We think of ''U'' as singling out those sets of indices that "matter": We write (''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) ≤ (''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) if and only if the set of natural numbers { ''n'' : ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; } is in ''U''.

This is a [[total preorder]] and it turns into a [[total order]] if we agree not to distinguish between two sequences ''a'' and ''b'' if ''a''≤''b'' and ''b''≤''a''. With this identification, the ordered field '''*R''' of hyperreals is constructed. From an algebraic point of view, ''U'' allows us to define a corresponding [[ideal (ring theory)|maximal ideal]] '''I''' in the commutative ring '''A''' (namely, the set of the sequences that vanish in some element of ''U''), and then to define '''*R''' as '''A'''/'''I'''; as the quotient of a commutative ring by a maximal ideal, '''*R''' is a field. This is also notated '''A'''/''U'', directly in terms of the free ultrafilter ''U''; the two are equivalent. The maximality of '''I''' follows from the possibility of, given a sequence ''a'', constructing a sequence ''b'' inverting the non-null elements of ''a'' and not altering its null entries. If the set on which ''a'' vanishes is not in ''U'', the product ''ab'' is identified with the number 1, and any ideal containing 1 must be ''A''. In the resulting field, these ''a'' and ''b'' are inverses.

The field '''A'''/''U'' is an [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]] of '''R'''.
Since this field contains '''R''' it has cardinality at least that of the continuum. Since '''A''' has cardinality

:&lt;math&gt;(2^{\aleph_0})^{\aleph_0} = 2^{\aleph_0^2} =2^{\aleph_0},&lt;/math&gt;

it is also no larger than &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, and hence has the same cardinality as '''R'''.

One question we might ask is whether, if we had chosen a different free ultrafilter ''V'', the quotient field '''A'''/''U'' would be isomorphic as an ordered field to '''A'''/''V''. This question turns out to be equivalent to the [[continuum hypothesis]]; in [[ZFC]] with the continuum hypothesis we can prove this field is unique up to [[order isomorphism]], and in ZFC with the negation of continuum hypothesis we can prove that there are non-order-isomorphic pairs of fields that are both countably indexed ultrapowers of the reals.

For more information about this method of construction, see [[ultraproduct]].

===An intuitive approach to the ultrapower construction===

The following is an intuitive way of understanding the hyperreal numbers. The approach taken here is very close to the one in the book by Goldblatt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Goldblatt | first1=Robert | title=Lectures on the hyperreals: an introduction to nonstandard analysis | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-98464-3 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recall that the sequences converging to zero are sometimes called infinitely small. These are almost the infinitesimals in a sense; the true infinitesimals include certain classes of sequences that contain a sequence converging to zero.

Let us see where these classes come from. Consider first the sequences of real numbers. They form a [[ring (abstract algebra)|ring]], that is, one can multiply, add and subtract them, but not always divide by a non-zero element. The real numbers are considered as the constant sequences, the sequence is zero if it is identically zero, that is,  ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''n''.

In our ring of sequences one can get ''ab''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 with neither ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 nor ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Thus, if for two sequences &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; one has ''ab''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, at least one of them should be declared zero. Surprisingly enough, there is a consistent way to do it. As a result, the equivalence classes of sequences that differ by some sequence declared zero will form a field, which is called a hyperreal [[field (mathematics)|field]]. It will contain the infinitesimals in addition to the ordinary real numbers, as well as infinitely large numbers (the reciprocals of infinitesimals, including those represented by sequences diverging to infinity). Also every  hyperreal that is not infinitely large will be infinitely close to an ordinary real, in other words, it will be the sum of an ordinary real and an infinitesimal.

This construction is parallel to the construction of the reals from the rationals given by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]. He started with the ring of the [[Cauchy sequence]]s of rationals and declared all the sequences that converge to zero to be zero. The result is the reals. To continue the construction of hyperreals, let us consider the zero sets of our sequences, that is, the &lt;math&gt;z(a)=\{i: a_i=0\}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;z(a)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of indexes &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;a_i=0&lt;/math&gt;. It is clear that if &lt;math&gt;ab=0&lt;/math&gt;, then the union of &lt;math&gt;z(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z(b)&lt;/math&gt; is ''N'' (the set of all natural numbers), so:
#One of the sequences that vanish on two complementary sets should be declared zero
#If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is declared zero, &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; should be declared zero too, no matter what &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is.
#If both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are declared zero, then &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt; should also be declared zero.
Now the idea is to single out a bunch ''U'' of subsets ''X'' of ''N'' and to declare that  &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;z(a)&lt;/math&gt; belongs to ''U''.  From the above conditions one can see that:
#From two complementary sets one belongs to ''U''
#Any set having a subset that belongs to ''U'', also belongs to ''U''.
#An intersection of any two sets belonging to ''U'' belongs to ''U''.
#Finally, we do not want the empty set to belong to ''U'' because then everything would belong to ''U'', as every set has the empty set as a subset.

Any family of sets that satisfies (2–4) is called a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] (an example: the complements to the finite sets, it is called the [[Fréchet filter]] and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an [[ultrafilter]] (because you can add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the family of sets containing a given element (in our case, say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use it in our construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the [[axiom of choice]]. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the [[ultrafilter lemma]]) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.

Now if we take a nontrivial ultrafilter (which is an extension of the Fréchet filter) and do our construction, we get the hyperreal numbers as a result.

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a real function of a real variable  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; naturally extends to a hyperreal function of a hyperreal variable by composition:
:&lt;math&gt;f(\{x_n\})=\{f(x_n)\}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\{ \dots\}&lt;/math&gt; means "the equivalence class of the sequence &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt; relative to our ultrafilter", two sequences being in the same class if and only if the zero set of their difference belongs to our ultrafilter.

All the arithmetical expressions and formulas make sense for hyperreals and hold true if they are true for the ordinary reals. It turns out that any finite (that is, such that &lt;math&gt;|x| &lt; a&lt;/math&gt; for some ordinary real &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) hyperreal &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will be of the form &lt;math&gt;y+d&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is an ordinary (called standard) real and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal. It can be proven by bisection method used in proving the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, the property (1) of ultrafilters turns out to be crucial.
Now one can see that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous means that &lt;math&gt;f(a)-f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is infinitely small whenever &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt;  is, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable means that
:&lt;math&gt;(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)-f'(a)&lt;/math&gt;
is infinitely small whenever &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt; is. Remarkably, if one allows &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to be hyperreal, the derivative will be automatically continuous (because, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;  being differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)-(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)=f'(x)-(f(a)-f(x))/(a-x)&lt;/math&gt;
is infinitely small when &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt; is, therefore &lt;math&gt;f'(x)-f'(a)&lt;/math&gt; is also infinitely small when &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt; is).

==Properties of infinitesimal and infinite numbers==

The finite elements '''F''' of '''*R''' form a [[local ring]], and in fact a [[valuation ring]], with the unique maximal ideal '''S''' being the infinitesimals; the quotient '''F'''/'''S''' is isomorphic to the reals. Hence we have a [[ring homomorphism|homomorphic]] mapping, st(''x''), from '''F''' to '''R''' whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] consists of the infinitesimals and which sends every element ''x'' of '''F''' to a unique real number whose difference from x is in '''S'''; which is to say, is infinitesimal. Put another way, every ''finite'' nonstandard real number is "very close" to a unique real number, in the sense that if ''x'' is a finite nonstandard real, then there exists one and only one real number st(''x'') such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;st(''x'') is infinitesimal. This number st(''x'') is called the [[standard part function|standard part]] of ''x'', conceptually the same as ''x'' ''to the nearest real number''. This operation is an order-preserving homomorphism and hence is well-behaved both algebraically and order theoretically. It is order-preserving though not isotonic; i.e. &lt;math&gt; x \le y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{st}(x) \le \operatorname{st}(y)&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y &lt;/math&gt; does not imply &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{st}(x) &lt; \operatorname{st}(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

* We have, if both ''x'' and ''y'' are finite,
::&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(x + y) = \operatorname{st}(x) + \operatorname{st}(y)  &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(x y) = \operatorname{st}(x)  \operatorname{st}(y)  &lt;/math&gt;
*  If ''x'' is finite and not infinitesimal.
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(1/x)  = 1 /  \operatorname{st}(x)  &lt;/math&gt;
* ''x'' is real if and only if
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(x) = x &lt;/math&gt;
The map st is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] with respect to the order topology on the finite hyperreals; in fact it is [[locally constant function|locally constant]].

==Hyperreal fields==
Suppose ''X'' is a [[Tychonoff space]], also called a T&lt;sub&gt;3.5&lt;/sub&gt; space, and C(''X'') is the algebra of continuous real-valued functions on ''X''. Suppose M is a [[prime ideal|maximal ideal]] in C(''X''). Then the [[factor ring|factor algebra]] A = C(''X'')/M is a totally ordered field F containing the reals. If F strictly contains '''R''' then M is called a '''hyperreal ideal''' (terminology due to [[Edwin Hewitt|Hewitt]] (1948)) and F a '''hyperreal field'''. Note that no assumption is being made that the cardinality of F is greater than '''R'''; it can in fact have the same cardinality.

An important special case is where the topology on ''X'' is the [[Discrete space|discrete topology]]; in this case ''X'' can be identified with a [[cardinal number]] κ and C(''X'') with the real algebra &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{R}^\kappa&lt;/math&gt; of functions from κ to '''R'''. The hyperreal fields we obtain in this case are called [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]]s of '''R''' and are identical to the ultrapowers constructed via free [[ultrafilter]]s in model theory.

An '''ideal speech situation''' was a term introduced in the early philosophy of [[Jürgen Habermas]]. It argues that an ideal speech situation is found when [[communication]] between individuals is governed by basic, implied rules. In an ideal speech situation, participants would be able to evaluate each other’s assertions solely on the basis of reason and evidence in an atmosphere completely free of any nonrational “coercive” influences, including both physical and psychological coercion. Furthermore, all participants would be motivated solely by the desire to obtain a rational consensus.
==Doctrines==
Members of the public sphere must adhere to certain rules for an "ideal speech situation" to occur. They are:

1. Every subject with the competence to speak and act is allowed to take part in a discourse.

2a. Everyone is allowed to question any [[Logical assertion|assertion]] whatever.

2b. Everyone is allowed to introduce any assertion whatever into the discourse.

2c. Everyone is allowed to express their attitudes, desires and needs without any hesitation.

3. No speaker may be prevented, by internal or external coercion, from exercising his rights as laid down in (1) and (2)
&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen. "Discourse Ethics: Notes on a Program of Philosophical Justification." Moral Consciousness
and Communicative Action. Trans. Christian Lenhart and Shierry Weber Nicholson.
Cambridge: MIT Press, 1990, pp. 43-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the ideal speech situation came under attack in the 1970s by theorists who persistently [[Relativism|relativized]] the concept, arguing that any ''particular'' conception of an ideal speech situation could not be proven completely correct, so that any (still-unknown) gaps would allow associated oppressions to arise or persist.

Habermas responded to this in 1983 with ''[[Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action]]'' (English trans. 1990).  In this work he no longer spoke of a known ideal speech situation but instead of a new [[moral philosophy|moral]] system ("Discourse ethics") that could be derived from the "presuppositions of argumentation".  These in turn could ''initially'' be postulated by philosophical analysis in the same way that [[Immanuel Kant]] tried to justify his own moral system through [[transcendental idealism|transcendental]] arguments. However, in contradistinction to Kant, Habermas recognizes that the presuppositions of argumentation can be tested in practice by a device he terms "performative contradiction".  If critics object to the presuppositions of argumentation, their argument ''might'' be turned on them to demonstrate that their argument has already granted the existence of whatever specific presupposition of argument they object to.  However, if such a performative [[contradiction]] cannot be found, then the presuppositions of argumentation must be revised to take account of the criticism and the moral system derived from these presuppositions altered accordingly.  In other words, "performative contradiction" is not a trump card to dismiss all objections but a fair test of those objections.  The [[dialectics|dialectical]] nature of Habermas's argument often goes unrecognized.

==Use in Pragmatics and Speech-Act Analysis==
The ideal speech situation, in its assumption of literal rather than figurative language function (language "below" rather than "above" the context-forming horizon of the lifeworld), is taken as the model for formal [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] analysis of [[speech act|speech-acts]].

'''José Antonio Offerman Dono''' (born November 8, 1968) is a Dominican retired professional [[baseball]] player who played professional baseball for nearly 20 years. He played for 15 seasons in the [[Major League Baseball]] and has played 4 seasons of [[Independent league baseball|independent]] and [[Mexican League]] baseball since leaving MLB.

He most recently managed the [[Licey Tigers]] of the [[Dominican Winter League]], leading them to the 2008–2009 and 2013–2014 Dominican Winter League Championship. During a baseball game on January 16, 2010, Offerman attacked an umpire during an argument and, as a result, was banned from the Winter League for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAX17wMMuC4&amp;feature=channel Video of José Offerman hitting an umpire] [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt; He managed the [[Rojos del Águila de Veracruz]] of the [[Mexican League]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite web|title=Offerman looks to coach in MLB again after legal trouble|url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2014/03/30/offerman-looks-to-coach-in-mlb-again-after-legal-trouble/|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=March 30, 2014|date=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
After attending [[Colegio Biblico Cristiano High School]] in [[San Pedro de Macorís]], Offerman signed with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] as an amateur [[free agent]] in 1986. In {{Baseball year|1988}}, he completed his first season of professional play being named as Best Prospect in the [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]]. Progressing rapidly through the minor leagues, he made his major league debut against the [[Montreal Expos]] on August 19, {{Baseball year|1990}} becoming the 55th player in major league history to hit a [[home run]] in his first major league [[at-bat]].

==Major leagues==
By {{Baseball year|1992}}, Offerman became the Dodgers' starting shortstop. On opening day 1993, he was the first batter to ever face the [[Florida Marlins]], striking out against [[Charlie Hough]]. He made his first appearance in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[1995 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1995]] but was traded to the [[Kansas City Royals]] after the season, mostly because of his very poor defense. After a year as a utility player, he won the starting [[second baseman]] job in 1997. Offerman had his best offensive seasons in Kansas City, culminating in {{Baseball year|1998}}, when he hit .315 with a league-leading 13 triples and the fifth most stolen bases, 45. After that season, he signed with the [[Boston Red Sox]] as a free agent, making the All-Star Game for the second time in [[1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1999]].

Known more for his hitting skills than his fielding, Offerman's offense began to decline in {{Baseball year|2000}}. He was sent to the [[Seattle Mariners]] during the {{Baseball year|2002}} season, but was released afterwards. In {{Baseball year|2003}}, he joined the [[Montreal Expos]] in [[spring training]] but was cut before the regular season began. He spent the entire year with the [[Bridgeport Bluefish]] of the independent [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]]. In {{Baseball year|2004}}, he won a spot on the [[Minnesota Twins]] roster and led the league in pinch-hits with 12 in 29 attempts. He started {{Baseball year|2005}} with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] but was released after a slow start. Later, he signed with the [[New York Mets]] and was called back up to the majors in June.

==Post-USA major leagues==
Most recently, Offerman played in the [[2008 Caribbean World Series]] for the [[Licey Tigers]] – Dominican Republic 2 team – where he assisted the team in winning its 10th Caribbean World Series title.  During the series he signed a contract with the 2008 [[Rojos del Águila de Veracruz|Veracruz Red Eagles]] of the [[Mexican Summer League]].

In December, 2008, Offerman was named player-manager of [[Licey Tigers]] of the [[Dominican Winter League]].  With Offerman as manager, Licey swept the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five straight against the Gigantes del Cibao.  As champions, Licey was then invited to participate in the 2009 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager (the series was ultimately won by Venezuela). (The Caribbean World Series is affiliated with the Winter League programs of Major League Baseball, featuring MLB players and prospects from the Dominican Winter League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.)

On January 7, 2014, Offerman was again named manager of the [[Licey Tigers]] of the [[Dominican Winter League]], replacing Mike Guerrero.  With Offerman at the helm, Licey won the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five games to three over the Leones del Escogido.  As champions again, Licey has been invited to the 2014 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager.  At present, his team has qualified for the semifinals of the tournament.

===Bat incident===
He has not played or managed professional baseball in the United States since 2007. 
On August 14, {{Baseball year|2007}}, Offerman was thrown out of a Ducks game against the [[Bridgeport Bluefish]] for charging Bluefish pitcher [[Matt Beech]] with a bat after he was hit by a pitch. Beech sustained broken finger in the resulting melee. Bluefish catcher [[John Nathans]] was also hit in the back of the head during the bench-clearing melee, receiving a severe concussion that effectively ended his playing career.&lt;ref name="ESPN-arrest"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2007, he was suspended indefinitely. The independent Atlantic League announced on August 17, 2007 that Offerman would remain suspended at least until the legal case was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suspension to remain in effect until legal proceedings finish|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2979699|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His case was pending in Bridgeport Superior Court GA#2 in Bridgeport, Connecticut.  He was represented by Attorney Frank J. Riccio II.  On October 30, 2007, Offerman was given two years special probation called "[[Accelerated Rehabilitation]] ('AR')."  The Court determined that his actions on August 14, 2007 were of an aberrant nature.  The Court also found that Offerman is not likely to offend again in the future.&lt;ref name="ESPN-probation"&gt;{{cite news

Nathans filed a $4.8 million civil suit against Offerman in February 2009, claiming that he still has [[post-concussion syndrome]] and that the injury allegedly caused by Offerman ended his baseball career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3902057 Jose Offerman Sued By John Nathans] ESPN.com, February 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2009/05/12/a_dizzying_turn/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=A dizzying turn | first=Stan | last=Grossfeld | date=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 29, 2014, Nathans won his suit, and Offerman was ordered to pay $940,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Offerman ordered to pay nearly $1M|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11282853/jose-offerman-ordered-pay-nearly-1-million-bat-attack-case|publisher=ESPN.com|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominican Republic Winter League incident===
On 16 January 2010, Offerman once again engaged in an on-field assault when he struck an umpire while managing a Dominican Republic winter league game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2010/01/16/sports/s205458S68.DTL&amp;tsp=1 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122003905/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2010%2F01%2F16%2Fsports%2Fs205458S68.DTL |archivedate=January 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Offerman, manager of the [[Licey Tigers]], came onto the field during the third inning while losing a 6-0 game to the [[Cibao Giants]], to protest ejection of his catcher for arguing balls and strikes and ended up arguing with first-base umpire [[D.J. Reyburn]]. He swung with a right hook at Reyburn, who then fell to the ground. Offerman was detained by stadium security, eventually being transported to the local police station to await the end of the game and Reyburn's decision whether to ask for charges to be pressed against him or not.

A day after the incident, the American crew that umpired the game resigned their positions with the Dominican Baseball League and left the country, reportedly due to threats and concerns about their own safety. Because of this incident Offerman received a lifetime ban from the Dominican Republic Winter League, a suspension that was eventually lifted in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almomento.net/articulo/130505/Levantan-suspension-a-Jose-Offerman-por-golpear-arbitro |title=Levantan suspensión a José Offerman por golpear árbitro – Almomento.net: Periodico Digital Dominicano |publisher=Almomento.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809201348/http://www.almomento.net/articulo/130505/Levantan-suspension-a-Jose-Offerman-por-golpear-arbitro |archivedate=2014-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, at the time he was suspended, Offerman was replacing [[Dave Jauss]] as Licey manager after Jauss was suspended himself for two years for bumping an umpire during a playoff game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4836498 |title=José Offerman banned for life by Dominican league – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-01-18 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the book by Robert Phillipson|Linguistic Imperialism}}
'''Linguistic imperialism''', or '''language imperialism''', a phenomenon that occasionally occurs, defined as "the transfer of a dominant [[language]] to other people". This language "transfer" comes about because of [[imperialism]]. The transfer is considered to be a demonstration of [[Power in international relations|power]]—traditionally, [[Armed forces|military power]] but also, in the modern world, [[economic power]]—and aspects of the dominant [[culture]] are usually transferred along with the language.

In the modern world, linguistic imperialism may also be considered in the context of international development, affecting the standard by which organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund (IMF)]] and the [[World Bank]] evaluate the trustworthiness and value of providing structural adjustment loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Master|first=Peter|date=1998-01-01|title=Positive and Negative Aspects of the Dominance of English|jstor=3588002|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=32|issue=4|pages=716–727|doi=10.2307/3588002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1990s, linguistic imperialism has attracted attention among scholars of [[applied linguistics]]. In particular, [[Robert Phillipson]]'s 1992 book, ''Linguistic Imperialism'', has led to considerable debate about its merits and shortcomings. Phillipson found denunciations of linguistic imperialism that dated back to Nazi critiques of the [[British Council]] (European aristocracy was at the time agreeing on the use of English), and to Soviet analyses of [[English language|English]] as the language of world [[capitalism]] and  [[Hegemony|world domination]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillipson, Robert (1992), p36.&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, criticism of English as a world language is rooted in [[anti-globalism]].

== English ==
{{Undue weight section|date=August 2015}}
Phillipson defines English linguistic imperialism as "the dominance of English... asserted and maintained by the establishment and continuous reconstitution of structural and cultural inequalities between English and other languages."&lt;ref&gt;Phillipson, Robert (1992), p [https://books.google.com/books?id=4jVeGWtzQ1oC&amp;pg=PA47 47].&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillipson's theory supports the historic spread of English  as an international language and that language's continued dominance, particularly in [[postcolonial]] settings such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Uganda]], [[Zimbabwe]], etc., but also increasingly in "neo-colonial" settings such as continental [[Europe]]. His theory draws mainly on [[Johan Galtung]]'s [[imperialism]] theory, [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s social theory, and in particular on his notion of [[cultural hegemony]].

A central theme of Phillipson's theory is the complex hegemonic processes{{Clarify|date=August 2015}} which, he asserts, continue to sustain the pre-eminence of English in the world today. His book analyzes the [[British Council]]'s use of rhetoric to promote English, and discusses key tenets of English [[applied linguistics]] and English-language-teaching methodology. These tenets hold that:

* English is best taught [[monolingual]]ly ("the monolingual fallacy");
* the ideal teacher is a [[native speaker]] ("the native-speaker fallacy");{{Clarify|date=August 2015|Why is this fallacious?}}
* the earlier English is taught, the better the results ("the early-start fallacy");{{Clarify|date=August 2015|Why is this fallacious?}}
* the more English is taught, the better the results ("the maximum-exposure fallacy");{{Clarify|date=August 2015|Why is this fallacious?}}
* if other languages are used much, standards of English will drop ("the subtractive fallacy").

According to Phillipson, those who promote English—organizations such as the British Council, the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], and individuals such as operators of English-language schools—use three types of argument:
* ''Intrinsic'' arguments describe the English language as providential, rich, noble and interesting. Such arguments tend to assert what English ''is'' and what other languages ''are not''.
* ''Extrinsic'' arguments point out that English is well-established: that it has many speakers, and that there are trained teachers and a wealth of teaching material. 
* ''Functional'' arguments emphasize the usefulness of English as a gateway to the world.

Other arguments for English are
* its economic utility: it enables people to operate technology;
* its ideological function: it stands for modernity;
* its status as symbol for material advance and efficiency.

Another theme in Phillipson's work is "[[linguicism]]"—the species of [[prejudice]] that leads to [[endangered languages]] becoming extinct or losing their local eminence due to the rise and competing prominence of English.

== Other languages ==

In 1976, Black school children in [[Soweto]] [[Soweto uprising|protested]] at being taught in [[Afrikaans]], which had been pushed by the [[Apartheid]] authorities concerned at the growing refusal of the Black population to speak it. They reasoned that by only having access to Afrikaner resources the South African government could control them more closely than having access to a global language i.e. [[English language|English]]. 176 children died for the right to be taught in English. The Uprising became a turning point in the [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|overthrow of Apartheid]] years later.

At various times, especially in colonial settings or where a dominant culture has sought to unify a region under its control, a similar phenomenon has arisen. In the [[Roman Empire]], [[Latin]]—originally the language of a limited region in central Italy—was imposed first on the rest of Italy and later on large parts of Europe, largely displacing previous languages spoken there, while in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]] Latin was merely dominant until it and the native languages were displaced by [[Arabization]].

[[Anatolia]] was similarly diverse linguistically when it was ruled by small native states.  Under the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic empires]], the language of the conqueror served as the ''[[lingua franca]]''.  The indigenous [[Anatolian languages]] disappeared.

In the [[Far East]], [[Africa]] and [[South America]], regional languages have been or are being coercively replaced or marginalized by the language of a dominant culture—[[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] and [[varieties of Chinese|regional Chinese varieties]] by [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], [[Ainu language|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan]] by [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Quechua language|Quechua]] by [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] by [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Philippine languages]] by [[Filipino language|Filipino/Tagalog]] and so on. [[Arabization]] has eliminated many indigenous languages in [[North Africa]], and restricted [[Coptic language|Coptic]] to sacred use.

The English language during the [[Middle Ages]] was an object of linguistic imperialism by the [[French language]], particularly following the [[Norman conquest]]. For hundreds of years, French or [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] was the language of administration (''See [[Law French]]'') and therefore a language of superior status in England. Latin remained the language of the church and of learning. Although many words introduced by the Normans are today indistinguishable by most English-speakers from native [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] words, later-learned [[loanword]]s derived from Latin or French often have a more cultured sound to a native English-speaker.

Following the establishment of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] over much of present-day [[Germany]] and [[Central Europe]], the [[German language]] and its dialects became the preferred language of many Central-European nobility. With varying success, German spread across much of Central and [[Eastern Europe]] as a language of trade and status. This ended with [[World War II]] (''See also [[Germanization]].'').

French too has expanded. Languages such as [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Corsican language|Corsican]] are to a great extent marginalised in France.  This process, known as [[Francization]], often causes resistance amongst the subject peoples, leading to demands for independence.  Examples of this can still be found in [[Brittany]] and [[Flanders]] ([[Belgium]]).

Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese colonization, made these languages prevalent in [[South America]] and in parts of [[Africa]],  [[Asia]] (the [[Philippines]]), [[Macau]] and in former times in [[Formosa]].  In Iberia, [[Castilian Spanish]], as spoken in the [[kingdom of Castile]] was imposed on other [[Nationalities and regions of Spain|regions of Spain]], initially by Germanic [[Habsburg Spain]] and later more fervently by the French [[Bourbon Spain]]; it was labeled "the companion of the Empire" by [[Antonio de Nebrija]] (1492) in the introduction to his ''[[Gramática de la lengua castellana]]''. Russian linguistic imperialism can be detected in [[Belarus]] both in the former dispute over the name of the country (Belarus vs Belorussia) and in the common spelling of the name of their president. English transcription has overtaken the Russian form [[Alexander Lukashenko]] instead of Belarusian form Alyaksandr Lukashenka.

==Critique==
Many scholars have participated in lively discussions of Phillipson's claims. Alan Davies, for instance, envisions the spectre of Phillipson haunting the Department of Applied Linguistics in Edinburgh:

{{Quote|'Round up the usual suspects', he cries, outing those who have pretended all these years merely to teach applied linguistics, but who have really been plotting with the British Council to take over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies (1996), p. 485&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Davies, two cultures inhabit linguistic imperialism: one, a culture of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] ("colonies should never have happened"); the other, that of romantic despair ("we shouldn't be doing what we are doing"). Rajagopalan goes a step farther and maintains that Phillipson's book has led to a guilt complex among [[English language learning and teaching]] (ELT) professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Rajagopalan (1999), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies also argues that Phillipson's claims are not [[falsifiable]]: what "if the dominated... wanted to adopt English and continue to want to keep it? RP's unfalsifiable answer must be that they don't, they can't, they've been persuaded against their better interests."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1996), p. 488&lt;/ref&gt; It has thus been argued that Phillipson's theory is patronizing in the sense that it does not regard developing countries as being capable of independent decision-making (to adopt or not to adopt ELT). In the context of [[Nigeria]], Bisong holds that people in the "[[Periphery countries|periphery]]" use English pragmatically—they send their children to English-language schools precisely because they want them to grow up multilingual. Regarding Phillipson, Bisong maintains that "to interpret such actions as emanating from people who are victims of Centre linguistic imperialism is to bend sociolinguistic evidence to suit a preconceived thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Bisong (1995 [1994]), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; If English should be abolished because it is foreign, Bisong argues, then Nigeria itself would also have to be dissolved, because it was conceived as a colonial structure.

Furthermore, the assumption that the English language itself is imperialistic has come under attack. [[Henry Widdowson]] has argued that  "there is a fundamental contradiction in the idea that the language of itself exerts hegemonic control: namely that if this were the case, you would never be able to challenge such control".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Widdowson (1998a), p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the idea that the promotion of English necessarily implies a demotion of local languages has been challenged. Holborrow points out that "not all Englishes in the centre dominate, nor are all speakers in the [[Periphery countries|periphery]] equally discriminated against".&lt;ref&gt;Holborrow (1993), p. 359; see also Bisong (1995 [1994]), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irish English]], for instance, could be regarded as a non-dominant centre variety of English.

Thus it could be argued that, while those who follow Phillipson see choices about language as externally imposed, the other camp sees them as decisions made by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1997), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
Those who support the arguments favoring the existence of linguistic imperialism claim that arguments against it are often advanced by [[monolingual]] native-speakers of English who may see the current status of English as a fact worthy of celebration.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In contrast, it has been argued that those who see the increasing spread of English in the world as a worrying development (that marginalizes the status of local and regional languages as well as potentially undermining or eroding cultural values) are likely to be far more receptive to Phillipson's views. [[Alastair Pennycook]], [[Suresh Canagarajah]], [[Adrian Holliday]] and [[Julian Edge]] broadly fall into this group and are often described as [[critical applied linguistics|critical applied linguists]].

However, [[Henry Widdowson]]’s remarks on [[critical discourse analysis]] may also be applied to the critical applied linguists:

{{Quote|It ought surely to be possible to say that an argument is confused, or an analysis flawed, without denying the justice of the cause they support. My view would be that if a case is just then we should look for ways of supporting it by coherent argument... And I would indeed argue that to do otherwise is to do a disservice to the cause. For the procedures of ideological exposure by expedient analysis... can, of course be taken up to further any cause, right wing as well as left.... If you have the conviction and commitment, you will always find your witch.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Widdowson (1998b), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a response to English linguistic imperialism, [[anglicisation#Place names|de-anglicisation]] became a matter of national pride in some places and especially in regions that were once under [[colonialism|colonial]] rule, where vestiges of colonial domination are a sensitive subject.&lt;ref name=ALD&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gaeilge.org/deanglicising.html | title=The Necessity for De-Anglicising Ireland | first=Douglas | last=Hyde | date=25 November 1892 | accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], "Native tongue title and language rights should be promoted. The government ought to define Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander vernaculars as official languages of Australia. We must change the linguistic landscape of Whyalla and elsewhere. Signs should be in both English and the local indigenous language. We ought to acknowledge intellectual property of indigenous knowledge including language, music and dance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/stop-revive-and-survive/story-e6frgcko-1226385194433 "Stop, revive and survive"], ''The Australian Higher Education'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appropriation==
Some who reject the concept of linguistic imperialism argue that the global spread of English is better understood in the framework of [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Spichtinger (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;—that English is used around the world ''for local purposes''.  In addition to the example of Nigeria,  above, the following examples have been given:

* Demonstrators in non-English-speaking countries often use signs in English to convey their demands to TV audiences around the globe. In some cases, the demonstrator may not even understand what the sign he is carrying says.
* Bobda shows how [[Cameroon]] has moved away from a mono-cultural, Anglo-centered way of teaching English and has gradually accommodated teaching materials to a Cameroonian context. Non-Western topics are treated, such as rule by [[emir]]s, [[traditional medicine]], and [[polygamy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bobda (1997), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Bobda argues for bi-cultural, Cameroonian and Anglo-American education.&lt;ref&gt;Bobda (1997), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kramsch and Sullivan describe how Western methodology and textbooks have been appropriated to suit local [[Vietnamese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramsch and Sullivan (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Pakistan]]i textbook ''Primary Stage English'' includes lessons such as "Pakistan, My Country", "Our Flag," and "Our Great Leader",&lt;ref&gt;Malik (1993), pp. 5, 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; which might sound [[jingoistic]] to western ears. Within the native culture, however, establishing a connection between ELT, patriotism and the [[Muslim]] faith is seen as an aim of ELT, as the chairman of the Punjab Textbook Board openly states: "The board... takes care, through these books to inoculate in the students a love of the Islamic values and awareness to guard the ideological frontiers of your [the student's] home lands."&lt;ref&gt;Punjab Text Book Board (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such an "internationalization" of English might also create new possibilities for English native-speakers. McCabe elaborates:

{{Quote|...whereas for two centuries we exported our language and our customs in hot pursuit of... fresh markets, we now find that our language and our customs are returned to us but altered so that they can be used by others... so that our own language and culture discover new possibilities, fresh contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe (1985), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[computing]] and [[systems design]] a '''loosely coupled''' system is one in which each of its [[Software component#Component Definition|component]]s has, or makes use of, little or no knowledge of the definitions of other separate components. Subareas include the [[Coupling (computer programming)|coupling]] of classes, interfaces, data, and services.&lt;ref&gt;''Loosely Coupled: The Missing Pieces of Web Services'' by [[Doug Kaye]]&lt;/ref&gt; Loose coupling is the opposite of [[tight coupling]].

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Components in a loosely coupled system can be replaced with alternative implementations that provide the same services. Components in a loosely coupled system are less constrained to the same platform, language, operating system, or build environment.

If systems are decoupled in time, it is difficult to also provide [[transactional integrity]]; additional coordination protocols are required. [[Data replication]] across different systems provides loose coupling (in availability), but creates issues in maintaining [[data consistency|consistency]] ([[data synchronization]]).

== In integration ==
Loose coupling in broader [[distributed system]] design is achieved by the use of transactions, queues provided by [[message-oriented middleware]], and interoperability standards.&lt;ref&gt;Pautasso C., Wilde E., [http://www2009.eprints.org/92/1/p911.pdf Why is the Web Loosely Coupled?], Proc. of WWW 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Four types of autonomy, which promote loose coupling, are: ''[[reference autonomy]]'', ''time autonomy'', ''format autonomy'', and ''platform autonomy''.&lt;ref&gt;F. Leymann [http://esocc2016.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Leymann-Keynote-ESOCC-2016.pdf Loose Coupling and Architectural Implications], ESOCC 2016 keynote&lt;/ref&gt;

Loose coupling is an architectural principle and design goal in [[service-oriented architecture]]s; eleven forms of loose coupling and their tight coupling counterparts are listed in:&lt;ref&gt;N. Josuttis, SOA in Practice. O'Reilly, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-596-52955-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* physical connections via mediator,
* [[asynchronous communication]] style,
* simple common types only in [[data model]],
* weak type system,
* [[data-centric]] and self-contained messages,
* distributed control of process logic,
* [[dynamic binding (computing)|dynamic binding]] (of service consumers and providers),
* platform independence,
* business-level compensation rather than system-level transactions,
* deployment at different times,
* implicit upgrades in versioning.
[[Enterprise Service Bus]] (ESB) middleware was invented to achieve loose coupling in multiple dimensions;&lt;ref&gt;M. Keen et al, [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246346.html?Open Patterns: Implementing an SOA using an Enterprise Service Bus], IBM, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; however, overengineered and mispositioned ESBs can also have the contrary effect and create undesired tight coupling and a central architectural hotspot.

[[Event-driven architecture]] also aims at promoting loose coupling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soa-eda.blogspot.com/2006/11/how-eda-extends-soa-and-why-it-is.html How EDA extends SOA and why it is important] Jack van Hoof&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods for decreasing coupling ===
Loose coupling of interfaces can be enhanced by publishing data in a standard format (such as [[XML]] or [[JSON]]).

Loose coupling between program components can be enhanced by using standard data types in parameters. Passing customized data types or objects requires both components to have knowledge of the custom data definition.

Loose coupling of services can be enhanced by reducing the information passed into a service to the key data. For example, a service that sends a letter is most reusable when just the customer identifier is passed and the customer address is obtained within the service.  This decouples services because services do not need to be called in a specific order (e.g. GetCustomerAddress, SendLetter).

Loose coupling of application integration in business process automation contexts can be increased by following a presentation layer integration model in which automation applications interact with underlying automated applications through the presentation layer or graphical user interface.

== In programming ==
Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one component has of another. Loose coupling in computing is interpreted as [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] vs. non-encapsulation.

An example of tight coupling occurs when a dependent class contains a pointer directly to a concrete class which provides the required behavior.  The dependency cannot be substituted, or its "signature" changed, without requiring a change to the dependent class.  Loose coupling occurs when the dependent class contains a pointer only to an interface, which can then be implemented by one or many concrete classes.  The dependent class's dependency is to a "contract" specified by the interface; a defined list of methods and/or properties that implementing classes must provide.  Any class that implements the interface can thus satisfy the dependency of a dependent class without having to change the class. This allows for extensibility in software design; a new class implementing an interface can be written to replace a current dependency in some or all situations, without requiring a change to the dependent class; the new and old classes can be interchanged freely.  Strong coupling does not allow this.

This is a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagram illustrating an example of ''loose'' coupling between a dependent class and a set of concrete classes, which provide the required behavior:

[[File:Loose Coupling Example.JPG]]

For comparison, this diagram illustrates the alternative design with ''strong'' coupling between the dependent class and a provider:

[[File:Strong Coupling Example.JPG]]

=== Other forms ===
Computer programming languages having notions of either functions as the core module (see [[Functional programming]]) or functions as objects provide excellent examples of loosely coupled programming. Functional languages have patterns of [[Continuation]]s, [[Closure (computer programming)|Closure]], or generators. See [[Clojure]] and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] as examples of function programming languages. Object-oriented languages like [[Smalltalk]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] have code blocks, whereas [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] has agents. The basic idea is to objectify (encapsulate as an object) a function independent of any other enclosing concept (e.g. decoupling an object function from any direct knowledge of the enclosing object). See [[First-class function]] for further insight into functions as objects, which qualifies as one form of first-class function.

So, for example, in an object-oriented language, when a function of an object is referenced as an object (freeing it from having any knowledge of its enclosing host object) the new function object can be passed, stored, and called at a later time. Recipient objects (to whom these functional objects are given) can safely execute (call) the contained function at their own convenience without any direct knowledge of the enclosing host object. In this way, a program can execute chains or groups of functional objects, while safely decoupled from having any direct reference to the enclosing host object.

Phone numbers are an excellent analog and can easily illustrate the degree of this decoupling.

For example: Some entity provides another with a phone number to call to get a particular job done. When the number is called, the calling entity is effectively saying, "Please do this job for me." The decoupling or loose coupling is immediately apparent. The entity receiving the number to call may have no knowledge of where the number came from (e.g. a reference to the supplier of the number). On the other side, the caller is decoupled from specific knowledge of who they are calling, where they are, and knowing how the receiver of the call operates internally.

Carrying the example a step further, the caller might say to the receiver of the call, "Please do this job for me. Call me back at this number when you are finished." The 'number' being offered to the receiver is referred to as a "Call-back". Again, the loose coupling or decoupled nature of this functional object is apparent. The receiver of the call-back is unaware of what or who is being called. It only knows that it can make the call and decides for itself when to call. In reality, the call-back may not even be to the one who provided the call-back in the first place. This level of indirection is what makes function objects an excellent technology for achieving loosely coupled programs.

=== Measuring data element coupling ===
The degree of the loose coupling can be measured by noting the number of changes in [[data element]]s that could occur in the sending or receiving systems and determining if the computers would still continue communicating correctly.  These changes include items such as:
# Adding new data elements to messages
# Changing the order of data elements
# Changing the names of data elements
# Changing the structures of data elements
# Omitting data elements

'''Overbelief''' (also written as "''over-belief''") is a [[philosophical]] term&lt;ref&gt;"Overbelief." Merriam-Webster.com. Accessed June 3, 2014. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/overbelief.&lt;/ref&gt; for a belief adopted that requires more evidence than one presently has. Generally, acts of overbelief are justified on emotional need or [[faith]], and a need to make sense of spiritual experience, rather than on empirical  [[evidence]]. This idea originates from the works of William James in [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/621 The Varieties of Religious Experience] online text&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the conceptual framework that individuals have. For James, a typical example of an overbelief would be R. W. Trine's contention that "The great central fact of the universe is that spirit of infinite life and power that is back of all, that manifests itself in and through all." James acknowledges that his own over-beliefs are so minimal that to some religious believers they may seem like "under-beliefs".

'''People's Democracy''' ('''PD''') was a political organisation that, while supporting the campaign for [[civil rights]] for [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Irish Catholic|Catholic minority]], stated that such rights could only be achieved through the establishment of a [[Socialist state|socialist republic]] for all of [[Ireland]].  It demanded more radical reforms of the [[government of Northern Ireland]] than the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] it came from.

==Foundation==
It was founded on 9 October 1968 at a meeting held in the [[Queen's University Belfast]] debating hall. A catalyst for its foundation had been the attack on a [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA) march in [[Derry]] on 5 October by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC).{{sfn|Devlin|1969|p=101}}

The group consisted mainly of students who were involved with the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association or left wing groups such as the Labour Clubs and Young Socialist Alliance.

At the meeting the group decided on five aims:
* [[One man, one vote]]
* Repeal of the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]]
* An end to [[gerrymandering]] of electoral boundaries
* Freedom of speech and assembly
* Fair allocation of jobs and housing

It was initially led by a committee of ten members which consisted of Queen's University students Malcolm Miles, Fergus Woods, Anne McBurnley, Ian Godall, [[Bernadette Devlin]], Joe Martin, Eddie McCamely, Michael O'Kane and Patricia Drinan, as well as [[Kevin Boyle (lawyer)|Kevin Boyle]], a law lecturer at QUB.  Other prominent members included [[Cyril Toman]], [[Eamon McCann]] and [[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]].{{sfn|Devlin|1969|p=102}}

The name of the group was selected by accident, according to [[Bernadette Devlin]].
{{quote|The next evening our leaflet and poster were approved by a mass meeting of the students, and taken off to be printed. John D. Murphy, our printer, got the material late at night and only then noticed that our organisation had no name. To comply with the law, he had to put up the name of the organisation responsible at the bottom of the leaflet, and, the story goes, he read through it, decided it was all about people's rights and christened us People's Democracy.{{sfn|Devlin|1969|p=103}} }}

After marches in Belfast, in imitation of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.'s]] [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], about 40 People's Democracy members held a four-day march between [[Belfast]] and Derry starting on 1 January 1969. The march was repeatedly attacked by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] along its route, including an incident at [[Burntollet]] bridge on 4 January where the marchers were attacked by about 200 [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]], including off-duty [[Ulster Special Constabulary|special constables]], armed with iron bars, bottles and stones, while the RUC stood by and watched.&lt;ref&gt;''The IRA'' by Tim Pat Coogan ({{ISBN|978-0312294168}}), page 626&lt;/ref&gt;

PD became increasingly radicalised as a result of these events. They also attacked the [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland|censorship laws in the Republic]] &amp;mdash; earning a rebuke from [[Ruairi Quinn]] and Basil Miller, then leaders of Students for Democratic Action, a revolutionary socialist student organisation, for letting [[British imperialism]] off the hook. In later years, members of the PD either quit politics altogether or became independent left-wing activists (such as Devlin and Farrell).

==Development==
In 1971, PD became a founder of the [[Socialist Labour Alliance]].

In the mid-1970s, the experience of the Ulster Workers' Council strike led to PD predicting a loyalist takeover in Northern Ireland, but it later came round to the view that this perspective was incorrect, giving loyalism a degree of autonomy from imperialism which it did not possess.&lt;ref&gt;John McAnulty ''A People Undefeated''&lt;/ref&gt;  The minority which clung to the old perspective left to form the Left Revolutionary Group, becoming the [[Red Republican Party]] in 1976, which was moribund by 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, PD evolved towards [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] positions and, by merging with the [[Dublin]]-based [[Movement for a Socialist Republic]], was recognised by the [[reunified Fourth International]] as its Irish section.

PD was especially active around the issues of [[internment]] and prisoners' rights. Following the formation of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee in 1979 to build support for the Republican prisoners then on the "[[blanket protest]]" in support of political status and the subsequent death of [[Bobby Sands]] and nine of his comrades during the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|H-Block hunger strikes]], a number of members of the organisation, led by Vincent Doherty - then a member of the Political Committee and a former party general election candidate - argued that PD should join Sinn Féin, which had moved openly to the left in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In [[Northern Ireland local elections, 1981|1981]], two members of People's Democracy were elected to [[Belfast City Council]]. John McAnulty and Fergus O'Hare were elected in a joint campaign with the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party|IRSP]]. [[Fergus O'Hare]] won the council seat of [[Gerry Fitt]], a sitting Westminster MP. O'Hare had been a founding member of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee and had previously been chairperson of the Political Hostages Release Committee which spearheaded the campaign against internment in the early 1970s. He subsequently went on to found the first Irish-language secondary school in Northern Ireland [[Meánscoil Feirste]].

When Sinn Féin ended its boycott of elections and gained mass support among the republican community, PD entered a political crisis. From 1982 on, a number of activists left them and joined Sinn Féin. At a PD national conference in 1986, a group including [[Anne Speed]] proposed the dissolution of the group and that the members all join SF as individuals. This position was defeated by 19 votes to five. A few weeks later the minority of five resigned from PD followed by their supporters and joined [[Sinn Féin]]. The remaining rump who continued to oppose this view maintained PD as a small propaganda group.

In the early 1990s the remaining members of PD initiated the [[Irish Committee for a Marxist Programme]] as an attempt to regroup [[socialists]] and left wing [[Irish Republicanism|republicans]]. This project ended in 1996, when PD dissolved and reconstituted itself as [[Socialist Democracy (Ireland)|Socialist Democracy]], adopting the program put forward by the ICMP.

Some debates have pervaded the field of psychology since its genesis. Perhaps one of the most salient ones deals with the nature of personality. Personality psychology studies one's distinctive style of [[cognition]], behavior, and [[affect (psychology)|affect]]. However, this concept elicits discord among psychologists as some have insisted that it does not exist,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} while others struggle with issues of measurement.

==Personality exists==
[[Personality]], one's characteristic way of feeling, behaving and thinking, is often conceptualized as a person's standing on each [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five personality trait]] ([[extraversion]], [[neuroticism]], [[openness to experience]], [[agreeableness]] and [[conscientiousness]]). A person's personality profile is thus gauged from their standing on five broad concepts which predict, among other life outcomes, behavior and the quality of interpersonal relationships. Initially, it was believed that one's Big Five profile was static and dichotomous in that one was either at one extreme of each trait or another &lt;ref&gt;Funder, D. C. (2010). The Personality Puzzle (5th Ed.). NY: Norton&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example, people are typically categorized as [[introverted]] or [[extraverted]]. Personality was therefore assessed in terms of generalities or averages. In noticing the strong inconsistencies in how people behaved across situations, some psychologists dismissed personality as nonexistent.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

This school of thought attributes human behavior to environmental factors, relegating individual differences to situational artifacts and contesting the existence of individual predispositions. It was led by [[Situationism (psychology)|situationists]] like [[Walter Mischel]] (1968). Their contention held that personality was a fictitious concept.  For them, the discrepancies observed across one's behaviors were evidence that interindividual differences did not exist &lt;ref&gt;Mischel, W. (1968). Personality and assessment. Hoboken, NJ US: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some aspects of the situationist perspective even suggest that all human beings are the same and that the differences we observe are simply illusory biproducts of the environment. 
          
However, personologists soon integrated these inconsistencies into their conceptualization of [[personality]]. They modified the old, more monolithic construct by measuring how people differ across situations. Their new methods of personality assessment describe fluctuations in personality characteristics as consistent and predictable for each person based on the environment he is in and his predispositions. Some work suggests that people can espouse different levels of a personality dimension as the social situations and time of day change&lt;ref name="Fleeson, William 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleeson | first1 = William | year = 2001 | title = Towards a structure- and process-integrated view of personality: Traits as density distributions of states | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 1011–1027 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.1011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
         
Therefore, someone is not [[conscientious]] all the time, but can be conscientious at work and a lot less so when she is home. This work also suggests that intrapersonal variations on a [[trait theory|trait]] can be even larger than interpersonal variations. [[Extraversion]] varies more within a person than across individuals, for example. This work was based on individual self-ratings during the day across a long period of time. This allowed for researchers to assess moment-to-moment and day to day variations on personality attributes.&lt;ref name="Fleeson, William 2001"/&gt;
Personologists now tend to agree that people's personalities are variegated and are not to be conceptualized through bipolar characterizations (e.g. extraversion vs introversion). Rather people oscillate between the two extremes of a trait. The pattern of this oscillation then constitutes personality.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==The impact of social roles==
In addition, social roles (e.g. employee) have been identified as a potential sources of [[personality]] change. Researchers have found strong correspondences between the demands of a [[social role]] and one's personality profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heller | first1 = D. | last2 = Perunovic | first2 = W. Q. E. | last3 = Reichman | first3 = D. | year = 2009 | title = The future of person-situation integration in the interface between traits and goals: A bottom-up framework | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 171–178 | doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2008.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
If the role requires that the person enacting it be [[conscientious]], her standing on this trait is more likely to be high. Conversely, once he leaves that role and or takes on another which entails less conscientiousness, he will manifest a lower level standing on that trait. Longitudinal research demonstrates that people's personality trajectories can often be explained by the social roles they espoused and relinquished throughout their life stages. Thus social roles are often studied as fundamental predictors of personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ozer | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Benet-Martínez | first2 = V. | year = 2006 | title = Personality and the prediction of consequential outcomes | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 401–421 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190127 | pmid=16318601}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The goals associated with them elicit the appropriation of certain personality profiles by the people enacting them. For example, employees judged effective by their peers and superiors are often described as conscientious as well.  
            
Personality also changes through life stages. This may be due to physiological changes associated with development but also experiences that impact behavior. Adolescence and young adulthood have been found to be prime periods of personality changes, especially in the domains of extraversion and agreeableness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Soto | first1 = C. J. | last2 = John | first2 = O. P. | last3 = Gosling | first3 = S. D. | last4 = Potter | first4 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Age differences in personality traits from 10 to 65: Big Five domains and facets in a large cross-sectional sample | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 330–348 | doi=10.1037/a0021717 | pmid=21171787}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has long been believed that personality development is shaped by life experiences that intensify the propensities that led individuals to those experiences in the first place,&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeronimus, B.F.| displayauthors=etal |year=2014|title= Mutual Reinforcement Between Neuroticism and Life Experiences: A Five-Wave, 16-Year Study to Test Reciprocal Causation|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=4|pages=751–64|pmid=25111305|doi=10.1037/a0037009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is known as the [[Correspondence principle (sociology)|corresponsive principle]].&lt;ref name="Caspi2011"/&gt;

Subsequent research endeavors have integrated these findings in their methods of investigation. Researchers distinguish between mean level and rank order changes in trait standing during old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mõttus | first1 = R. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = W. | last3 = Deary | first3 = I. J. | year = 2012 | title = Personality traits in old age: Measurement and rank-order stability and some mean-level change | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 243–249 | doi = 10.1037/a0023690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Their study of personality trajectories is thus contingent on time and on age considerations. Mottus, Johnson and Geary (2012) found that instability engendered by aging does not necessarily affect one's standing within an age cohort. Hence, fluctuations and stability coexist so that one changes relative to one's former self but not relative to one's peers. Similarly, other psychologists found that [[Neuroticism]], [[Extraversion]] (only in men), and [[Openness to experience|Openness]] decreased with age after 70, but [[Conscientiousness]] and [[Agreeableness]] increased with age (the latter only in men). Moreover, they suggest that there is a decline on each trait after the age of 81.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lucas | first1 = R. E. | last2 = Donnellan | first2 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Age differences in personality: Evidence from a nationally representative Australian sample | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 5| pages = 1353–1363 | doi = 10.1037/a0013914 | pmid=19702397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inconsistency as a trait==
Personality inconsistency has become such a prevalent consideration for personologists that some even conceptualize it as a predisposition in itself. Fleisher and Woehr (2008) suggest that that consistency across the Big Five is a construct that is fairly stable and contributes to the predictive validity of personality measures. Hence inconsistency is quantifiable much like a trait and constitutes an index of and enhances the fit of psychological models.

To accommodate the inconsistency demonstrated on personality tests, researchers developed the Frame Of Reference principle (FOR). According to this theory, people tend to think of their personality in terms of a specific social context when they are asked to rate them.  Whichever environment is cognitively salient at the time of the personality measurement will influence the respondent's ratings on a trait measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reddock | first1 = C. M. | last2 = Biderman | first2 = M. D. | last3 = Nguyen | first3 = N. T. | year = 2011 | title = The relationship of reliability and validity of personality tests to frame-of-reference instructions and within-person inconsistency | url = | journal = International Journal of Selection and Assessment | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 119–131 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2389.2011.00540.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
If, for example, the person is thinking in terms of their student identity, then the personality ratings he reports will most likely reflect the profile he espouses in the context of student life. Accounting for the FOR principle aims at increasing the validity of personality measures.  This demonstrates that the predictive validity of personality measures which specify a social context is a lot higher than those measures which take a more generic approach.
          
This point is substantiated by yet another body of work suggesting that FOR instructions moderated the link between extraversion and openness scores on manager ratings of employee performance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunthausen | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Truxillo | first2 = D. M. | last3 = Bauer | first3 = T. N. | last4 = Hammer | first4 = L. B. | year = 2003 | title = A field study of frame-of-reference effects on personality test validity | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 545–551 | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.88.3.545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This research thus recognizes the importance of intrapersonal fluctuations contingent on personality is context specific and is not necessarily generalizable across social domains and time.

==Change over a lifetime==
There are two very specific types of change that researchers tend to focus on: rank-order change and mean-level change. A ''rank-order change'' refers to a change in an individual's personality trait relative to other individuals; such changes do not occur very often.&lt;ref name="Funder 258"&gt;{{cite book|last=Funder|first=David C.|title=The Personality Puzzle|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|pages=258|edition=5th|isbn=0-393-93348-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A ''mean-level change'' refers to an absolute change in the individual's level of a certain trait over time. Longitudinal research shows that mean-level change does occur.&lt;ref name="Funder 258" /&gt; However, some [[Trait theory|traits]] tend to change while some traits tend to stay stable.

There is an increase in consistency of a trait as age increases. However, personality does not stop changing at a specific age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Brent W. | last2 = DelVecchio | first2 = Wendy F. | title = The Rank-Order Consistency of Personality Traits From Childhood to Old Age: A Quantitative Review of Longitudinal Studies | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | pages = 3–25 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.126.1.3 | pmid = 10668348 | issue = 1 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological and social transitions in life may also be a factor for change. Biological transitions are stages like [[puberty]] or first childbirth. Social transitions might be changes in social roles like becoming a parent or working at a first job. These life transitions do not necessarily cause change, but they may be reasons for change. One theory says that whether or not these life transitions cause personality change is based on whether the transition was expected based on age or was unforeseen.&lt;ref name="Caspi and Moffitt"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Caspi | first1 = Avshalom | last2 = Moffitt | first2 = Terrie E. | title = When Do Individual Differences Matter? A Paradoxical Theory of Personality Coherence | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 4 | pages = 247–271 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1207/s15327965pli0404_1 | issue = 4 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events that are expected will cause personality change because those events have common [[Behavioral script|scripts]]. However, events that are unexpected will give prominence to the traits that already exist for the individual.&lt;ref name="Caspi and Moffitt" /&gt; Historical context also affects personality change. Major life events can lead to changes in personality that can persist for more than a decade.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"/&gt; A [[longitudinal study]] followed women over 30 years and found that they showed increases in individualism. This may have been due to the changes that were occurring in the country at the time.&lt;ref name="Roberts and Helson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Brent W.|author2=Ravenna Helson|title=Changes in Culture, Changes in Personality: The Influence of Individualism in a Longitudinal Study of Women|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1997|volume=72|issue=3|pages=641–651|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.641|pmid=9120788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple ways for an individual's personality to change. Individuals will change their behavior based on the ideas in their environment that emit [[Reward system#Psychological reward|rewards]] and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishments]]. Some of these ideas might be implicit, like social roles. The individual changes his or her personality to fit into a [[social role]] if it is favorable. Other ideas might be more explicit like a parent trying to change a child's behavior.&lt;ref name="Caspi and Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caspi|first=Avshalom|author2=Brent W. Roberts|title=Personality Development Across the Life Course: The Argument for Change and Continuity|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=2001|volume=12|issue=2|pages=49–66|doi=10.1207/S15327965PLI1202_01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An individual may decide to actively try to change his or her own behavior/ personality after thinking about his or her own actions. [[Therapy]] involves the same type of introspection. The individual along with the therapist identifies the behaviors that are inappropriate, and then self-monitors in order to change them. Eventually the individual internalizes the behavior they want to attain, and that trait will generalize to other areas of the individual's life.
Personality change also occurs when individuals observe the actions of others. Individuals may mimic the behaviors of others and then internalize those behaviors. Once the individual internalizes those behaviors they are said to be a part of that person's personality.&lt;ref name="Caspi and Roberts" /&gt;
Individuals also receive feedback from other individuals or groups about their own personality. This is a driving force of change because the individual has social motivations to change his or her personality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} It has also been shown that major positive and negative life events can predict changes in personality.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2013"/&gt;

===Change in the Big Five===
The [[Big Five personality traits]] are often used to measure change in personality. There is a mean-level change in the Big Five traits from age 10 to 65.&lt;ref name="Soto1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Soto | first1 = Christopher J. | title = Age Differences in Personality Traits From 10 to 65: Big Five Domains and Facets in a Large Cross-Sectional Sample | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 100 | pages = 330–348 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1037/a0021717 | pmid = 21171787 | last2 = John | first2 = OP | last3 = Gosling | first3 = SD | last4 = Potter | first4 = J | issue = 2 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The trends seen in adulthood are different from trends seen in childhood and [[adolescence]]. Some research suggests that during adolescence rank-order change does occur and therefore personality is highly unstable.&lt;ref name="McCrae, Costa, and Terrachio"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCrae|first=Robert R. |author2=Paul T. Costa Jr |author3=Antonio Terracciano |author4=Wayne D. Parker |author5=Carol J. Mills |author6=Filip De Fruyt |author7=Ivan Mervielde |title=Personality Trait Development From Age 12 to 18: Longitudinal, Cross-Sectional, and Cross-Cultural Analyses|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2002|volume=83|issue=6|pages=1456–1468|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1456|pmid=12500824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender differences are also shown before adulthood.&lt;ref name=Soto1 /&gt;  [[Conscientiousness]] drops from late childhood to adolescence, but then picks back up from adolescence into adulthood. [[Agreeableness]] also drops from late childhood to adolescence, but then picks back up from adolescence into adulthood. [[Neuroticism]] shows a different trend for males and females in childhood and adolescence. For females, Neuroticism increases from childhood to adolescence. Then Neuroticism levels from adolescence into adulthood and continues the adult trend of decreasing. Males however, tend to gradually decrease in Neuroticism from childhood to adolescence into adulthood. [[Extraversion]] drops from childhood to adolescence and then does not significantly change. [[Openness to experience]] also shows a different trend for different genders. Females tend to decrease in Openness to experience from childhood to early adulthood and then gradually increases all throughout adulthood. Males tend to decrease in Openness to experience from childhood to adolescence, then it tends to increase through adulthood. In adulthood, Neuroticism tends to decrease, while Conscientiousness and Agreeableness tend to increase. Extraversion and Openness to experience do not seem to change much during adulthood. These trends seen in adulthood are different from trends seen in childhood and adolescence.&lt;ref name="Soto1"/&gt;   [[Big Five personality traits and culture|Cross-cultural]] research shows that German, British, Czech, and Turkish people show similar trends of these personality traits.&lt;ref name="McCrae, Costa, and Ostendorf"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCrae|first=Robert R. |author2=Paul T. Costa Jr |author3=Margarida Pedrosa de Lima |author4=Antonio Simoes |author5=Fritz Ostendorf |author6=Alois Angleitner |author7=Iris Marusic |author8=Denis Bratko |author9=Gian Vittorio Caprara |author10=Claudio Barbaranelli |author11=Joon-Ho Chae |title=Age Differences in Personality Across the Adult Life Span: Parallels in Five Cultures|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=2|pages=466–477|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.35.2.466|pmid=10082017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Five personality traits can also be broken down into [[Facet (psychology)|facets]]. Different facets of each personality trait are often correlated with different behavioral outcomes. Breaking down the personality traits into facets is difficult and not yet at a consensus. However, it is important to look at change in facets over a lifetime separate from just the change in traits because different facets of the same trait show different trends.&lt;ref name=Soto1 /&gt;  Neuroticism can be broken into the two facets of anxiety and depression. Anxiety has the same trend as Neuroticism for both males and females. For females, anxiety increases from childhood to adolescence, at [[emerging adulthood]] it levels out, and then starts to decrease into and throughout middle age. Anxiety in males tends to decrease from late childhood through adulthood. Depression (not [[clinical depression]], but rather susceptibility to negative affect) shows two peaks in females. Females tend to have higher levels of this kind of depression in adolescence and then again in early adulthood. Depression does, however, have a negative trend through adulthood. For males, depression tends to show an increase from childhood to early adulthood and then shows a slight decrease through middle age.&lt;ref name=Soto1 /&gt;

'''Planograms''', also known as '''plano-grams''', '''plan-o-grams''', '''[[schematic]]s''' and '''POGs''', are visual representations of a store's products or services on display. They are considered a tool for [[visual merchandising]]. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', a plangoram "is a diagram or model that indicates the placement of retail products on shelves in order to maximize sales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/planogram?region=us|title=planogram(plan·o·gram)|author= |date= |work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the planogram can be measured by the sales volume generated from the specific area being diagramed.

==Overview==
Planograms are predominantly used in [[retail]] businesses. A planogram defines the location and quantity of products to be placed on display. The rules and theories for creating planograms are set under the terms of [[merchandising]]. For example, given limited shelf space, a vendor may prefer to provide a wide assortment of products, or may limit the assortment but increase the facings of each product to avoid stock-outs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/616081266|title=Supply chain management for retailing|last=Rajesh.|first=Ray,|date=2010|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780070145047|location=New Delhi|oclc=616081266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers often send planograms to stores ahead of new product shipments. This is useful when a vendor wants retail displays in multiple store locations to have the same look and feel. Often, a consumer goods manufacturer releases a planogram with each new product to show how the product can relate to existing products.

[[Fast Moving Consumer Goods|Fast-moving consumer goods]] organizations and [[supermarket]]s mostly use text and box-based planograms to optimize shelf space, [[Inventory turnover|inventory turns]] and [[profit margin]]s. Apparel brands and retailers are more focused on presentation and use pictorial planograms that illustrate the look and brand identity for each product.

==Placement methods==
===Visual===
Visual product placement is supported by different theories including; horizontal, vertical, and block placement. Horizontal product placement increases the concentration of a certain article. Research studies suggest that a product's relation to customer eye levels directly correlates to its sales.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2008/12/18/the-way-the-brain-buys&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; This depends on the customer's distance from the unit. Vertical product placement puts products on more than one shelf level to achieve {{convert|15|cm|in}} – {{convert|30|cm|in}} of placement space. Similar products are placed in blocks.

===Commercial===
Commercial placement is determined by both market share placement and margin placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/i1vihjvnvieo/planogram/|title=PLANOGRAM|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Market share research companies like [[ACNielsen]] collect sales data for various products and calculate market share of products in various market segments. Margin placement is determined by the profit margin of a specific item. Higher margin places a product closer to the front of the store, where it is most likely to attract attention.

===Derivative objectives===

* To communicate how to set the merchandise
* To ensure sufficient inventory levels on the shelf or display
* To use space effectively (e.g. floor, page, and screen)
* To facilitate communication of retailer's brand identity
* To assist in the process of mapping a store

==Creation==
The planogram concept originated with [[Kmart|KMart]]. Planograms are created with the help of planogramming software by a Planogram Specialist, Space Planning Specialist or Space Planning Manager. The retail industry utilizes software to ensure proper stocking. Retailers turn to planogram software to reflect each store’s particular customer profile and localized demand, while maintaining centralized control and supply chain efficiency. 

For example, some software packages focused upon [[fast-moving consumer goods]] and [[hard goods]] sectors made enhancements to transfer parts of shelving elements to single store measurements, which, according to the producers, should increase efficiency.

Retailers automate the creation of store-specific planograms through use of corporate-level business rules and constraints describing best practices. Such planogramming solutions allow these companies to respond with location and language-specific messaging, pricing, and product placements based on business rules derived from location, campaign and fixture attributes to create localized assortments.

Recent advances in store virtualization and collaboration allow manufacturers, retailers and category management experts from across the globe to work in the same virtual store in real time.

{{one source|date=January 2015}}
In [[political science]] and [[political history]], the term '''power vacuum,''' also known as a power void, is an analogy between a physical [[vacuum]], to the [[politics|political]] condition "when someone has lost control of something and no one has replaced them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/power-vacuum|title=power vacuum Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation can occur when a [[government]] has no identifiable central [[Power (social and political)|power]] or [[authority]]. The physical analogy suggests that in a power vacuum, other forces will tend to "rush in" to fill the vacuum as soon as it is created, perhaps in the form of an armed [[militia]] or [[insurgency|insurgents]], [[military]] [[Coup d'état|coup]], [[warlord]] or [[dictator]]. The term is also often used in [[organized crime]] when a [[crime family]] becomes vulnerable to competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9037101-mob-murder-and-the-hamilton-connection/|title=Mob, murder and the Hamilton connection|date=16 November 2018|publisher=thespec.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hereditary or statutory [[order of succession]] or effective [[succession planning]] are orderly ways to resolve questions of succession to positions of power. When such methods are unavailable, such as in failed [[dictatorship]]s or [[civil war]]s, a power vacuum arises, which prompts a '''power struggle''' entailing [[politics|political]] competition, [[violence]], or (usually) both. A power vacuum can also occur after a [[constitutional crisis]] in which large portions of the government resign or are removed, creating unclear succession.

== Historical examples ==

Historic examples include the [[death of Alexander the Great]], the 11th century power vacuum in the middle east which allowed the [[Seljuks]] to take over, the defeat of France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]], and the decrease in power of Great Britain and France in the Middle East after the [[Suez Crisis]].

During the course of the [[Ming treasure voyages]] (1405-1433), the Chinese [[Ming dynasty|Ming empire]] was the dominant political and military force within the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=fin92/&gt; However, in 1433, the Chinese government withdrew their [[Chinese treasure fleet|treasure fleet]] and thus left a large void within the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=fin92&gt;{{cite journal | last=Finlay | first=Robert | title=Portuguese and Chinese Maritime Imperialism: Camoes's Lusiads and Luo Maodeng's Voyage of the San Bao Eunuch|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=1992 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=225–241 | jstor=178944 | ref=harv | doi=10.1017/S0010417500017667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary examples ==

When in 2003 the [[United States]] led [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|a coalition]] to oust [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Iraq War]], the absence of an all-out Iraqi opposition force at war with government forces meant that once the [[Ba'ath Party]] was removed, no local figures were on hand to immediately assume the now-vacant administerial posts. For this reason, [[Paul Bremer]] was appointed by the United States government as the interim head of state to oversee the transition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/CPA_ORHA/Doc_128_CPA_Legal_Instruments.pdf Memo to Bremer from Office of General Counsel, CPA dated 22 May 2003, Retrieved February 28, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113023438/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/CPA_ORHA/Doc_128_CPA_Legal_Instruments.pdf |date=13 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other western-led interventions such as in [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Kosovo]] (1999) and [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libya]] (2011) where the initial claim of justification in each case was a humanitarian matter, there had been active opposition fighting on the ground to oust the relevant governments (in the case of Kosovo, this meant removal of state forces from the desired territory rather than ousting the government itself). Subsequently, successor entities were immediately effective in Libya and Kosovo.

The '''Red Power movement''' was a social movement led by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] youth to demand self-determination for Native Americans in the United States. Organizations that were part of Red Power Movement included [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) and [[National Indian Youth Council]] (NIYC).&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/246350552|title=Red power : the Native Americans' fight for freedom|last=M.|first=Josephy, Alvin|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Univ. of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803276117|oclc=246350552}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement sought the rights for Native Americans to make policies and programs for themselves while maintaining and controlling their own land and resources.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The Red Power movement took a confrontational and civil disobedience approach to inciting change in United States to Native American affairs&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/909325616|title=Like a hurricane : the Native American movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee|last=Allen|first=Warrior, Robert|date=1996-01-01|publisher=New Press|isbn=9781565844025|oclc=909325616}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to using negotiations and settlements, which national Native American groups such as [[National Congress of American Indians]] had before.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Red Power centered around mass action, militant action, and unified action.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://redpowermedia.wordpress.com/2014/01/03/from-the-red-power-movement-to-idle-no-more/|title=From the Red Power Movement to Idle No More|last=Media|first=Red Power|last2=Staff|date=2014-01-03|website=RED POWER MEDIA|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "'''Red Power'''", attributed to the author [[Vine Deloria, Jr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Vine Deloria Jr.|date=2018-06-29|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vine_Deloria_Jr.&amp;oldid=848033644|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly expressed a growing sense of pan-Indian identity in the late 1960s among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Events that were part of the movement include the [[Occupation of Alcatraz]], the [[Trail of Broken Treaties]], the [[Wounded Knee incident|Occupation of Wounded Knee]], along with intermittent protests and occupations throughout the era.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/alca/indian.html&lt;/ref&gt; The lasting impression of the Red Power movement was the resurrection of American Indian pride, action, and awareness.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Many bills and laws were also enacted in favor of American Indians in response to the Red Power movement, one of the most important being the reversal of tribe recognition termination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Background ==
From 1953 to 1964, the United States government terminated recognition of more than 100 tribes and bands as sovereign dependent nations with the [[House concurrent resolution 108|House Concurrent Resolution 108]]. This resolution stated that the tribes would be under US law and treated as American citizens instead of having the status as wards of the US.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0614.html|title=INDIAN AFFAIRS: LAWS AND TREATIES. Vol. 6, Laws|last=Library|first=Oklahoma State University|website=digital.library.okstate.edu|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affected tribes were no longer protected by the government and stripped of their right to govern their own people.

[[Indian Relocation Act of 1956|The Relocation Act of 1956]] resulted in as many as 750,000 American Indians migrating to cities during the period from 1950-1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/indiancountry/history/relocate.html|title=Indian Country Diaries . History . 1950s Relocation Program {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act was implemented to encourage and provide support for American Indians to find jobs in cities and improve their lives from the poverty-ridden reservations. The government offered vocational training, housing, and financial support for those who chose to relocate. These promised amenities were often not provided or inadequately provided, resulting in American Indians distanced from their cultural lands and economically worse off than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walls|first=Melissa L.|last2=Whitbeck|first2=Les B.|title=The Intergenerational Effects of Relocation Policies on Indigenous Families|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0192513X12447178|journal=Journal of Family Issues|language=en|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1272–1293|doi=10.1177/0192513x12447178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Relocation and Termination era described above fueled the resistance of American Indians. The oldest recognized National American Indian group was [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI), established in 1944.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/163306494|title=Dictionary of American history / 10 Contributors, Learning Guide, and Index.|last=I.|first=Kutler, Stanley|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Scribner's Sons|isbn=0684805332|oclc=163306494}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCAI set a precedent by successfully being the first multi-tribal political organization run entirely by Indians. NCAI fought against voting discrimination, against the termination of [[Government-to-government|government to government]] relationship between the US and native tribes, and against US interference in tribal counsels. They aimed to close gaps between Indians who lived on reservations and those who had relocated to cities, elderly and Indian Youth, and different tribes from one another.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; NCAI was the main political organization that preceded the Red Power Movement.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

== Main organizations involved ==

=== [[American Indian Movement]] ===

At the forefront of the Red Power Movement was American Indian Movement(AIM), which was founded in 1968 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].  Its members belonged to and represented mainly urban Indian communities, and its leaders were young and militant.  Like the [[Black Panthers]] and [[Brown Berets]], AIM was initially organized to work for Indian civil rights in cities.  Its members monitored law enforcement practices, and worked to highlight and prevent police harassment and brutality.  AIM soon played a major role in building a network of [[urban Indian]] centers, churches and [[philanthropic organization]]s.  It helped establish the "[[powwow circuit]]," which publicized news of protest activities across the country.  Skillful in attracting attention from the news media, AIM inspired local chapters and writing about American Indian political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aimovement.org/ggc/history.html|title=A Brief Histry of AIM|website=www.aimovement.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[National Indian Youth Council]] ===

The National Indian Youth Council(NIYC) was founded in 1961 by young American Indians who were college students or recent college graduates.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/national-indian-youth-council|title=National Indian Youth Council - Dictionary definition of National Indian Youth Council {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were one of the first militant Indian rights organizations following the conservative ways of the NCAI. NIYC were strong opponents of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and got involved in many of the events in the Red Power Movement.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Like AIM, the council believed in and fought for the recognition of tribes federally and reinstating tribal governance.

=== [[Women of All Red Nations]] ===

Women of All Red Nations (WARN) emerged in 1974 from the main founders, [[Lorelei DeCora Means]], [[Madonna Thunder Hawk|Madonna Thunderhawk]], [[Phyllis Young]], [[Janet McCloud]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DreCFo6MrR8C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Red Power: The American Indians' Fight for Freedom|last=Josephy|first=Alvin M.|last2=Nagel|first2=Joane|last3=Johnson|first3=Troy R.|date=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803225873|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARN acted as a branch from AIM that focused on American Indian women's and family rights. Main issues that WARN fought against were the forced sterilization of Native women and the lack of adequate health services on the reservations.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://equalityarchive.com/issues/women-of-all-red-nations/|title=Women of All Red Nations {{!}} Equality Archive|date=2015-11-03|work=Equality Archive|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARN took action by becoming involved in Indian custody battles, protesting mining companies who were poisoning food and water sources, and collecting data on Indian women who had been sterilized without consent.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== [[International Indian Treaty Council]] ===

The International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) was founded in 1974 in Standing Rock, South Dakota. More than 98 Indigenous tribes were represented by over 5000 people at this first gathering. IITC grew into a voice for Indians internationally—covering North, Central, and South America, the Caribbean, and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iitc.org/about-iitc/|title=About IITC / Acerca de CITI - iitc.org|website=www.iitc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; IITC focuses on the pursuit of sovereignty and self-determination for indigenous peoples through activism, training, and unified gatherings. As the first indigenous organization to be granted Consultive Status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1977, IITC was able to represent the concerns and fight for the acknowledgement of indigenous rights to the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aimovement.org/iitc/|title=International Indian Treaty Council &amp; AIM Speakers Bureau|website=www.aimovement.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
From 1969 to the [[Longest Walk of 1978]], the Red Power Movement highlighted issues through social protest.  Its goals were for the federal government to honor treaty obligations and provide financial "resources, education, housing and healthcare to alleviate poverty."&lt;ref name="Alcatraz Is Not an Island"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/alcatrazisnotanisland/activism.html "Alcatraz Is Not an Island"], ''Indian Activism'', pbs.org, accessed 10 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The RPM wanted to gain Indian participation in social institutions; it was instrumental in supporting the founding of Indian colleges, as well as the creation of [[Indian studies]] programs at existing institutions, and the establishment of museums and cultural centers to celebrate Indian contributions.

The 1960s marked the beginning of a "[[Native American Renaissance]]" in literature.  New books such as [[Vine Deloria, Jr.]]'s ''[[Custer Died for Your Sins]]'' (1969) and the classic ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]'' (1961), reprinted from the 1930s, reached millions of readers inside and outside Indian communities.  A wide variety of [[Native American writers|Indian writers]], [[Native American historians|historian]]s, and [[essayists]] gained publication following these successes and new authors were widely read.  [[N. Scott Momaday]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for one of his novels and [[Leslie Silko]] received acclaim.  Fiction and nonfiction works about Indian life and lore have continued to attract a large audience. Authors such as [[Louise Erdrich]] and [[Michael Dorris]] have earned continued recognition.  Since the late twentieth century, novels by [[Sherman Alexie]] have been adapted for film as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/223155553|title=Native American renaissance|last=Kenneth.|first=Lincoln,|date=1992-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520054578|oclc=223155553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupation of Alcatraz  ===
The [[Occupation of Alcatraz]] began on November 20, 1969 when more than 80 young, mostly college aged American Indians, who identified themselves as [[United Indians of All Tribes|Indians of All Tribes (IAT)]]&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; boarded boats to approach and occupy [[Alcatraz Island]] overnight. The young American Indians settled with the legal backing of a [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Sioux Treaty]] that named any federal "out of use" land available for Indians. The US federal government had closed the Alcatraz federal prison and the island was no longer in use as of 1962. This treaty was used to send the message that treaties are still relevant and should be honored.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;  
[[File:Alcatraz Occupation "Welcome to Indian Land" graffiti.jpeg|thumb|352x352px|Sign in Alcatraz (1969)]]
The occupation had been planned ahead of time by [[Adam Nordwall]], a successful Indian businessman, and [[Richard Oakes (activist)|Richard Oakes]], a [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State]] student. The two agreed to and told sympathetic media outlets about their plan to take over Alcatraz at a dinner party hosted by ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reporter Tim Findley. They threatened that if there were any leaks of the story early, the plan to occupy Alcatraz would be called off.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Their first attempt, on November 9, 1969—the date the media had been told—resulted in circling the island in a boat with media coverage from all over the Bay Area. Although they did not begin the occupation that night, Oakes jumped off of the circling boat as others followed and swam to Alcatraz. After making it to Alcatraz, the young Indians were removed by Coast Guard that night but would be back in much larger numbers on November 20.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;{{Quote box
| title = Excerpt From Alcatraz Proclamation
| quote = We feel that this so-called Alcatraz Island is more than suitable as an Indian Reservation, as determined by the white man's own standards. By this we mean that this place resembles most Indian reservations, in that:
1. It is isolated from modern facilities, and without adequate means of transportation.

2. It has no fresh running water.

3. The sanitation facilities are inadequate.

4. There are no oil or mineral rights.

5. There is no industry and so unemployment is very great.

6. There are no health care facilities.

7. The soil is rocky and non-productive and the land does not support game.

8. There are no educational facilities.

9. The population has always been held as prisoners and kept dependent upon others.

}}During the occupation, IAT released a statement called the [[Alcatraz Proclamation]] which explained that the Indians had the right to Alcatraz Island due to the right to discovery. The Proclamation continued onto describing the deserted prison island as comparable to the conditions of the Indian Reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=ALCATRAZ_Proclamation|title=ALCATRAZ Proclamation - FoundSF|website=www.foundsf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAT was also joined by National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) during the Alcatraz movement and the growing group of young, educated, and passionate American Indians made their presence known in the media.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Richard Oakes became the public figure for the occupation and participated in the press conferences for releases of documents such as the Alcatraz Proclamation and goals for the island which included building cultural centers, educational facilities, and recreational spaces for Indians to be together as Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Intelligent Channel|title=Richard Oakes delivering the Alcatraz Proclamation (1969) - from THE EDUCATION ARCHIVE|date=2013-03-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QNfUE7hBUc|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Occupation of Alcatraz ended after a series of disorienting events on the island. The January 1970 death of Richard Oakes' 13-year-old stepdaughter due to falling from a building brought Richard and his wife Anne back to the mainland.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Some of the student occupiers went back to school when the Oakes' left. A problem of drug and alcohol abuse also became prominent on the island, which affected the occupations reputation.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; The remaining leaders were John Trudell, LaNada Means, and Stella Leach, who could not end up agreeing on a way to further develop the occupation. Electricity and water being cut off to the island by May, and a suspicious fire that burned three buildings were further factors that led to the dismantling of the occupation.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Protestors continued to depart from the island during the downward spiral. On June 11, 1971 a large amount of police officers used force to remove the remaining few protestors.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

Although the protesters ultimately failed to achieve their specific goals, they helped catalyze  the Indian community.  With the occupation of Alcatraz, a participant said, "we got back our worth, our pride, our dignity, our humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2096434 |title=American Indian Ethnic Renewal: Politics and the Resurgence of Identity |first=Joane |last=Nagel |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |volume=60 |number=6 |date=Dec 1995 |pages=947–965 |registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupation of D-Q University ===
With young, college aged students at the center of many Red Power movement protests, the pursuit of higher education, particularly for American Indians became a main initiative. In 1970, while the Alcatraz occupation was still occurring, a group of Indian youth took over US military surplus land near Davis, California. These youth had applied for the land but were denied access after [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] was granted access, regardless of UC Davis' legally incomplete application. In retaliation, the youth hopped the fences onto the property leading to the establishment and occupation of [[D–Q University|D-Q University]].&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AuOXYesYSn0C&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=DQ+university#v=onepage&amp;q=DQ%20university&amp;f=false|title=American Indian Activism: Alcatraz to the Longest Walk|last=Johnson|first=Troy R.|last2=Nagel|first2=Joane|last3=Champagne|first3=Duane|date=1997-01-01|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252066535|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-Q University became the first tribal university that was established in California, and the first that was not affiliated with a single reservation. A deed was granted to the student occupation in April 1971.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Since then, D-Q University became part of the [[Tribal colleges and universities|Tribal Colleges and Universities]] and received accreditation in 1977. The curriculum of D-Q University included cultural and traditional focused education in order to educate Indians about Indians.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; The university struggled to keep enrollment rates up and secure funding, which resulted in the ultimate loss of accreditation in 2005. However, the occupation that created D-Q University highlighted the importance of higher education for American Indians to the Red Power Movement.

=== Trail of Broken Treaties ===
[[File:Seal of the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs.svg|thumb|BIA seal]]
In August 1972, the Red Power movement continued under the direction of American Indian Movement(AIM) with the [[Trail of Broken Treaties|trail of broken treaties]]. The trail of broken treaties, a play on the "[[Trail of Tears]]," was the migration of seven caravans from areas across the west coast to the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.framingredpower.org/narrative/tbt/|title=Framing Red Power|last=Heppler|first=Jason A.|website=www.framingredpower.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BIA had become widely associated with corruption and not acting in the best interest of the American Indians.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://washingtonspark.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/native-americans-take-over-bureau-of-indian-affairs-1972/|title=Native Americans Take Over Bureau of Indian Affairs: 1972|date=2013-03-26|website=Washington Area Spark|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protestors started arriving in D.C. on November 1 with the intent of bringing a [[Twenty Points|list of twenty demands]] to the BIA.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Upon arrival, the activists and GSA security had a misunderstanding about the activists being housed in the BIA building. This resulted in the activists overpowering the security and taking over the building. The American Indians then barricaded the doors, with furniture from the BIA they had broken apart, and the occupation began on November 2, 1972.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This occupation of the BIA had started the week before the presidential election, making a D.C. occupation the center of media attention. Threats of police force were used daily against the Indians if they did not come out. Supporters from outside of the occupation would come to the BIA to create a human barricade keeping the police from entering the occupied building.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On November 6, a judge had given an order for the occupiers to vacate the building before 6 pm that day or they would be forcibly evicted.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As the Indians braced for eviction, some exited the building to create a perimeter around it with clubs, spears and other weaponry to resist.  Others inside the building were rumored to have guns and explosives awaiting the invasion of GSA officials.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The spokesman of the occupation, [[Russell Means|Russel Means]], spoke on the front stairs of the BIA explaining that the occupation would end when their demands had been met, and no time sooner. The deadline for the Indians to leave was pushed back yet again to November 8. Before this date, Indian lawyers had discovered evidence that would essentially abolish the BIA with exposure of corruption and misuse of the program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On November 8, the protestors left the BIA building with paintings, artifacts, and $2 million worth of damage.

=== Wounded Knee ===
The [[Wounded Knee incident|Wounded Knee Incident]] started on February 27, 1973 and lasted 71 days. More than 200 Indians in support of the Oglala Sioux people of Pine Ridge Reservation took over the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota. The Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO), a group of mostly full-Indian women that lived on Pine Ridge Reservation had been unsuccessful in a trial to impeach Dick Wilson, who was the chairman of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OEzAiB8U6EC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=Oglala+Sioux+Civil+Rights+Organization+(OSCRO)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rzJJ9pya80&amp;sig=T8lZELkugTlECAnYPEebKtE82EA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rOAJTsCJMsOssAKQnrSyAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Oglala%20Sioux%20Civil%20Rights%20Organization%20(OSCRO)&amp;f=false|title=Ruling Pine Ridge: Oglala Lakota Politics from the IRA to Wounded Knee|last=Reinhardt|first=Akim D.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|isbn=9780896726017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Wilson claimed he was too close to white people, too cozy with the government, and was disrespecting his Oglala Sioux culture.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/04/obituaries/richard-wilson-55-tribal-head-in-occupation-of-wounded-knee.html|title=Richard Wilson, 55, Tribal Head In Occupation of Wounded Knee|last=Foderaro|first=Lisa W.|date=1990-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enraged that Wilson had not been impeached, OSCRO continued to gather and brainstorm a response. They decided to ask AIM for help in reacting to what they felt was an injustice. With AIM in the picture, occupying Wounded Knee was their final decision.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Wounded Knee was chosen as a tribute to the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] of 1890, where hundreds of Lakota Indians were killed by the 7th US Cavalry Regiment in reported efforts to disarm the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.056|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains {{!}} WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a historical remembrance of the massacre, the town had visitor trade posts dedicated to the grave sites of the Indians that many Indians thought were disrespectful and used for commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; The owners of the trade posts would sell native Indian crafts for more than they had bought them and had a history of racism towards the local Indians. The occupiers attacked the trade posts first to accumulate the ammunitions and weaponry that were held there.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The occupation formed to deliver a message that American Indians would not sit around peacefully as treaties were broken, unfair trials were given, and their land was ceded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aics.org/WK/wk011.html|title=American Indian Movement Documents from MSU|last=Movement|first=Mike Wicks of American Indian|website=www.aics.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal agents gathered around Wounded Knee while the occupiers would host events for the media to cover in order to promote their message.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Throughout the occupation of Wounded Knee, the protestors and federal agents would often have shootouts at night. The Indians would be shooting from inside Wounded Knee and the federal agents from the outside perimeter they had formed.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/may-8-1973-standoff-at-wounded-knee-comes-to-an-end/comment-page-1/?_r=0|title=May 8, 1973 {{!}} Standoff at Wounded Knee Comes to an End|last=Network|first=The Learning|work=The Learning Network|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these shootouts, two Indians were killed and one federal agent was permanently paralyzed. The death of the second Indian, who was from the Pine Ridge Reservation and an Oglala Sioux, Buddy Lamont, led many Indians to seek an end to the violent occupation. On May 8, 1973 the American Indians surrendered to the surrounding federal agents after 10 weeks.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Russell Means, one of the more recognized leaders of the AIM, negotiated with U.S. forces to release the hostages on the premises that the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hold hearings on the Indian treaties that were broken by the U.S. government as well as investigations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and its members' attention to the living conditions at Pine Ridge.

This event is not only significant because it was one of the first violent acts initiated first by the Natives, but it also led to generations of Indians getting involved in civil rights and tribal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landry|first1=Alysa|title=Wounded Knee is hailed as one of AIM's greatest successes|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/history/events/native-history-aim-occupation-of-wounded-knee-begins/|website=Indian Country Today|publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nixon administration]] had earlier declared that it had wanted to end the "revolutionary Indian element", but because so many Natives took notice and began to make changes in the local governments controlling their reservations, the administration failed to end their protests and stopped trying to interfere.

Russell Means and [[Dennis Banks]], the two AIM leaders mostly in charge of Wounded Knee II, were arrested immediately after the hostages were released. However, on September 16, 1973, the charges were dropped and they were dismissed on the account that the U.S. government had unlawfully influenced witnesses and tampered with evidence. The violence of these types of protests then continued through the rest of the 1970s.

== Legacy ==
The Red Power movement had accomplished many of its goals by the time direct social activism declined in the late 1970s. "By the early 1980s, over 100 Indian studies programs had been created in the United States. Tribal museums opened."&lt;ref name="Alcatraz Is Not an Island" /&gt; Among the most prominent of the cultural centers is the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] (NMAI), which was sponsored by Hawaii's senator [[Daniel Inouye]] and authorized by the [[US Congress]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/alcatraz-occupation-four-decades-ago-led-to-many-benefits-for-american-indians/|title=Alcatraz Occupation Four Decades Ago Led to Many Benefits for American Indians - Indian Country Media Network|website=indiancountrymedianetwork.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NMAI opened on [[National Mall|the Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]] in 2004. It also has a branch at the former US Customs House, on the Bowling Green in [[Lower Manhattan]].

Many laws were passed in response to the Red Power movement, one of the most notable being the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975|Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]] of 1975, which reversed the termination of federal tribe recognition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This act restored the recognition and government to government status to tribes, giving them control to govern their own tribes and reservations with funding provided by the government if they followed certain guidelines. Since the termination of Indian tribe recognition was a major catalyst to start the movement,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; regaining recognition was considered a huge success for RPM.

=== Laws passed in favor of American Indians during the Red Power movement ===
The following laws were passed during the movement:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''[[Indian Education Act]] of 1972''' provided additional funds to school districts with high populations of Indian children
* '''[[Indian Health Service]] budget doubled''' from 1970 to 1975, which provided funding for Indian hospitals and clinics.
* '''[[Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission]] (NWIFC)''' was established in 1975, as a result of fish-in protests. The NWIFC consists of members from 20 tribes who are recognized as natural resources co-managers with the State of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nwifc.org|title=Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission|website=Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''[[Indian Health Care Improvement Act]]''' of 1976 was passed by Congress to improve the health-care system for American Indians. This act includes scholarships for American Indians who are looking to pursue studies in medicine, dentistry, psychiatry, nursing and pharmacy. 
* '''[[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]]''' was passed in 1978 and terminated the outlaw of Indian religious practices such as sun dance, bear dance, and the use of sweat lodges.
* '''[[Branch of Acknowledgement and Research]] (BAR)''' was created by the BIA in 1978 to process applications from tribes for federal recognition. BAR was never federally approved, but still is in control of recognizing Indian tribes.
* '''[[Indian Child Welfare Act]]''' was passed by Congress in 1978. This act was in response to years of the BIA placing Indian children in boarding schools away from their reservations. It allows tribes to have some control over adoption and placement of Indian orphan children. 
* '''[[Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act]]'''  of 1978 authorized community colleges to exist on reservations

'''Reduce''' is a collective communication primitive used in the context of a [[parallel programming model]] to combine multiple vectors into one, using an [[Operator associativity|associative]] [[Binary operation|binary operator]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;. Every vector is present at a distinct processor in the beginning. The goal of the primitive is to apply the operator in the order given by the processor-indices to the vectors until only one is left. The reduction of sets of elements is an integral part of programming models such as [[MapReduce|Map Reduce]], where a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] is applied ([[Map (higher-order function)|mapped]]) to all elements before they are reduced. Other [[parallel algorithm]]s use reduce as a primary operation to solve more complex problems. The [[Message Passing Interface]] implements it in the operations &lt;code&gt;MPI_Reduce&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MPI_Allreduce&lt;/code&gt;, with the difference that the result is available at one (root) processing unit or all of them. Closely related to reduce is the broadcast operation, which distributes data to all processors. Many reduce algorithms can be used for broadcasting by reverting them and omitting the operator.

== Definition ==
Formally, reduce takes an [[Associative property|associative]] (but not necessarily [[Commutative property|commutative]]) operator &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;, which can be evaluated in constant time and an input set &lt;math&gt;V = \{v_0 = \begin{pmatrix} e_0^0 \\ \vdots \\ e_0^{m-1}\end{pmatrix}, v_1 = \begin{pmatrix} e_1^0 \\ \vdots \\ e_1^{m-1}\end{pmatrix}, \dots, v_{p-1} = \begin{pmatrix} e_{p-1}^0 \\ \vdots \\ e_{p-1}^{m-1}\end{pmatrix}\}&lt;/math&gt;of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; vectors with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; elements each. The total size of a vector is defined as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The result &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; of the operation is the combination of the elements &lt;math&gt;r = \begin{pmatrix} e_0^0 \oplus e_1^0 \oplus \dots \oplus e_{p-1}^0 \\ \vdots \\ e_0^{m-1} \oplus e_1^{m-1} \oplus \dots \oplus e_{p-1}^{m-1}\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \bigoplus_{i=0}^{p-1} e_i^0 \\ \vdots \\ \bigoplus_{i=0}^{p-1} e_i^{m-1} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and has to be stored at a specified root processor at the end of the execution. For example, the result of a reduction on the set &lt;math&gt;\{3,5,7,9\}&lt;/math&gt;, where all vectors have size one is &lt;math&gt;3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24&lt;/math&gt;. If the result &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; has to be available at every processor after the computation has finished, it is often called Allreduce. An optimal sequential linear-time algorithm for reduction can apply the operator successively from front to back, always replacing two vectors with the result of the operation applied to all its elements, thus creating an instance that has one vector less. It needs &lt;math&gt;(p-1)\cdot m &lt;/math&gt; steps until only &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is left. Sequential algorithms can not perform better than linear time, but parallel algorithms leave some space left to optimize.

== Binomial tree algorithms ==
Regarding parallel algorithms, there are two main models of parallel computation, the [[Parallel random-access machine|parallel random access machine]] as an extension of the RAM with shared memory between processing units and the [[Bulk synchronous parallel|bulk synchronous parallel computer]] which takes communication and [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] into account. Both models have different implications for the [[Time complexity|time-complexity]], therefore two algorithms will be shown.

=== PRAM-algorithm ===
This algorithm represents a widely spread method to handle inputs where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a power of two. The reverse procedure is often used for broadcasting elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bar-Noy|first=Amotz|last2=Kipnis|first2=Shlomo|title=Broadcasting multiple messages in simultaneous send/receive systems|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0166-218X(94)90001-9|journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics|volume=55|issue=2|pages=95–105|doi=10.1016/0166-218x(94)90001-9|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santos|first=Eunice E.|title=Optimal and Efficient Algorithms for Summing and Prefix Summing on Parallel Machines|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/jpdc.2000.1698|journal=Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing|volume=62|issue=4|pages=517–543|doi=10.1006/jpdc.2000.1698|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slater|first=P.|last2=Cockayne|first2=E.|last3=Hedetniemi|first3=S.|date=1981-11-01|title=Information Dissemination in Trees|url=http://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0210052|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|volume=10|issue=4|pages=692–701|doi=10.1137/0210052|issn=0097-5397}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Binomial tree.gif|thumb|436x436px|

The binary operator for vectors is defined such that &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} e_i^0 \\ \vdots \\ e_i^{m-1}\end{pmatrix} \oplus^\star \begin{pmatrix} e_j^0 \\ \vdots \\ e_j^{m-1}\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} e_i^0 \oplus e_j^0 \\ \vdots \\ e_i^{m-1} \oplus e_j^{m-1} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. The algorithm further assumes that in the beginning &lt;math&gt;x_i = v_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a power of two and uses the processing units &lt;math&gt;p_0,p_1,\dots p_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;. In every iteration, half of the processing units become inactive and do not contribute to further computations. The figure shows a visualization of the algorithm using addition as the operator. Vertical lines represent the processing units where the computation of the elements on that line take place. The eight input elements are located on the bottom and every animation step corresponds to one parallel step in the execution of the algorithm. An active processor &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; evaluates the given operator on the element &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; it is currently holding and &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the minimal index fulfilling &lt;math&gt;j &gt; i&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; is becoming an inactive processor in the current step. &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; are not necessarily elements of the input set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as the fields are overwritten and reused for previously evaluated expressions. To coordinate the roles of the processing units in each step without causing additional communication between them, the fact that the processing units are indexed with numbers from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;p-1&lt;/math&gt; is used. Each processor looks at its &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th least significant bit and decides whether to get inactive or compute the operator on its own element and the element with the index where the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th bit is not set. The underlying communication pattern of the algorithm is a binomial tree, hence the name of the algorithm.

Only  &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; holds the result in the end, therefore it is the root processor. For an Allreduce-operation the result has to be distributed, which can be done by appending a broadcast from &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, the number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of processors is restricted to be a power of two. This can be lifted by padding the number of processors to the next power of two. There are also algorithms that are more tailored for this use-case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabenseifner|first=Rolf|last2=Träff|first2=Jesper Larsson|date=2004-09-19|title=More Efficient Reduction Algorithms for Non-Power-of-Two Number of Processors in Message-Passing Parallel Systems|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30218-6_13|journal=Recent Advances in Parallel Virtual Machine and Message Passing Interface|volume=3241|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=36–46|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-30218-6_13|isbn=9783540231639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Runtime analysis ====
The main loop is executed &lt;math&gt;\lceil\log_2 p\rceil&lt;/math&gt; times, the time needed for the part done in parallel is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(m)&lt;/math&gt; as a processing unit either combines two vectors or becomes inactive. Thus the parallel time &lt;math&gt;T(p,m)&lt;/math&gt; for the PRAM is &lt;math&gt;T(p,m) = \mathcal{O}(log(p) \cdot m)&lt;/math&gt;. The strategy for handling read and write conflicts can be chosen as restrictive as an exclusive read and exclusive write (EREW). The efficiency &lt;math&gt;S(p,m)&lt;/math&gt; of the algorithm is &lt;math&gt;S(p,m) \in \mathcal{O}(\frac{T_{seq}}{T(p,m)}) = \mathcal{O}(\frac{p}{log(p)})&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the efficiency is &lt;math&gt;E(p,m) \in \mathcal{O}(\frac{S(p,m)}{p}) = \mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{log(p)})&lt;/math&gt;. The efficiency suffers because of the fact that half of the active processing units become inactive after each step, so &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{2^i}&lt;/math&gt; units are active in step &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Distributed memory algorithm ===
In contrast to the PRAM-algorithm, in the [[distributed memory]] model memory is not shared between processing units and data has to be exchanged explicitly between units, resulting in communication overhead that is accounted for. The following algorithm takes this into consideration.
: '''for''' &lt;math&gt;k \gets 0&lt;/math&gt; '''to''' &lt;math&gt;\lceil\log_2 p\rceil - 1&lt;/math&gt; '''do'''
:: '''for''' &lt;math&gt;i \gets 0&lt;/math&gt; '''to''' &lt;math&gt;p - 1&lt;/math&gt; '''do in parallel'''
::: '''if''' &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;  '''is active then'''
:::: '''if bit''' &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; '''of''' &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; '''is set then'''
::::: '''send''' &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; '''to''' &lt;math&gt;p_{i-2^k}&lt;/math&gt;
::::: '''set''' &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; '''to inactive'''
:::: '''else if''' &lt;math&gt;i + 2^k &lt; p&lt;/math&gt;
::::: '''receive''' &lt;math&gt;x_{i+2^k}&lt;/math&gt; 
::::: &lt;math&gt;x_i \gets x_i \oplus^\star x_{i+2^k}&lt;/math&gt;
The only difference between the distributed algorithm and the PRAM version is the inclusion of explicit communication primitives, the operating principle stays the same.

==== Runtime analysis ====
A simple analysis for the algorithm uses the BSP-model and incorporates the time &lt;math&gt;T_{start}&lt;/math&gt; needed to initiate communication and &lt;math&gt;T_{byte}&lt;/math&gt; the time needed to send a byte. Then the resulting runtime is &lt;math&gt;\Theta((T_{start} + n \cdot T_{byte})\cdot log(p))&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; elements of a vector are send in each iteration and have size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in total.

== Pipeline-algorithm ==
[[File:Pipeline reduce.gif|thumb|476x476px|Depiction of the pipeline-algorithm using addition as the operator on vectors of size four.]]For distributed memory models, it can make sense to use pipelined communication. This is especially the case when &lt;math&gt;T_{start}&lt;/math&gt; is small in comparison to &lt;math&gt;T_{byte}&lt;/math&gt;. Usually, [[Pipeline (computing)|linear pipelines]] split data or a task into smaller pieces and process them in stages. In contrast to the binomial tree algorithms, the pipelined algorithm uses the fact that the vectors are not inseparable, but the operator can be evaluated for single elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bar-Noy|first=A.|last2=Kipnis|first2=S.|date=1994-09-01|title=Designing broadcasting algorithms in the postal model for message-passing systems|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01184933|journal=Mathematical systems theory|language=en|volume=27|issue=5|pages=431–452|doi=10.1007/BF01184933|issn=0025-5661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''for''' &lt;math&gt;k \gets 0&lt;/math&gt; '''to''' &lt;math&gt;p+m-3&lt;/math&gt; '''do'''
:: '''for''' &lt;math&gt;i \gets 0&lt;/math&gt; '''to''' &lt;math&gt;p - 1&lt;/math&gt; '''do in parallel'''
::: '''if''' &lt;math&gt;i \leq k &lt; i+m \land i \neq p-1&lt;/math&gt;
:::: '''send''' &lt;math&gt;x_i^{k-i} &lt;/math&gt; '''to''' &lt;math&gt;p_{i+1} &lt;/math&gt;
::: '''if''' &lt;math&gt;i-1 \leq k &lt; i-1+m \land i \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
:::: '''receive''' &lt;math&gt;x_{i-1}^{k+i-1}&lt;/math&gt; '''from''' &lt;math&gt;p_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;x_{i}^{k+i-1} \gets x_{i}^{k+i-1} \oplus x_{i-1}^{k+i-1}&lt;/math&gt; 
It is important to note that the send and receive operations have to be executed concurrently for the algorithm to work. The result vector is stored at &lt;math&gt;p_{p-1}&lt;/math&gt; at the end. The associated animation shows an execution of the algorithm on vectors of size four with five processing units. Two steps of the animation visualize one parallel execution step. The number of steps in the parallel execution are &lt;math&gt;p + m -2&lt;/math&gt;, it takes &lt;math&gt;p-1&lt;/math&gt; steps until the last processing unit receives its first element and additional &lt;math&gt;m-1&lt;/math&gt; until all elements are received. Therefore, the runtime in the BSP-model is &lt;math&gt;T(n,p,m) = (T_{start} + \frac{n}{m}T_{byte})(p+m-2)&lt;/math&gt;, assuming that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the total byte-size of a vector.

Although &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; has a fixed value, it is possible to logically group elements of a vector together and reduce &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. For example, a problem instance with vectors of size four can be handled by splitting the vectors into the first two and last two elements, which are always transmitted and computed together. In this case, double the volume is send each step, but the number of steps has roughly halved. It means that the parameter &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is halfed, while the total byte-size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; stays the same. The runtime &lt;math&gt;T(p)&lt;/math&gt; for this approach depends on the value of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, which can be optimized if &lt;math&gt;T_{start}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{byte}&lt;/math&gt; are known. It is optimal for &lt;math&gt;m = \sqrt{\frac{n \cdot (p-2)T_{byte}}{T_{start}}}&lt;/math&gt;, assuming that this results in a smaller &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; that divides the original one.

== Pipelined tree ==
[[File:Pipelined binomial.gif|thumb|483x483px|Pipelined Fibonacci-tree algorithm using addition.]]
The binomial tree and the pipeline both have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the values of &lt;math&gt;T_{start}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{byte}&lt;/math&gt; for the parallel communication. While the binomial tree algorithm is better suited for small vectors, the pipelined algorithm profits from a distribution of the elements to fewer processing units with more elements contained in one vector. Both approaches can be combined into one algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Peter|last2=Sibeyn|first2=Jop F|title=A bandwidth latency tradeoff for broadcast and reduction|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0020-0190(02)00473-8|journal=Information Processing Letters|volume=86|issue=1|pages=33–38|doi=10.1016/s0020-0190(02)00473-8|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; which uses a tree as its underlying communication pattern and splits the computation of the operator into pieces at the same time. Instead of the binomial tree, a [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] tree is used which has the property that the height of the trees rooted at its two children differ by one. It helps to balance the load on all processing units as each unit can only evaluate one operator in one iteration on one of its elements, but it has two child-processors it receives values from.

=== Algorithm description ===
The animation shows the execution of such an algorithm in a [[Duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]] communication model. Communication links are represented by black lines between the vectors of elements and build a Fibonacci tree of size seven in this example. If an element is send to another processing unit the link is colored with the color of the corresponding element. An element that is received by a processor is added to the already existing element of same color (at the same index in the vector).

The algorithm itself propagates the partial sums from bottom to top until all elements are contained in the sum at the root processor on top. In the first step of the execution, the processing units which are leafs in the underlying tree send their first elements to their parent. This is similar to the send operations of the binomial tree algorithm with the key difference that the leaf units each have two more elements which have to be send and therefore do not become inactive, but can continue to send elements, which is analogous to the pipelined approach and improves efficiency. Processing units that are not leafs start to send their elements in order of the indices in the vector once they have received an element from a child. In the example they send green, blue and red elements in this order. If two processors compete to send their elements to the same processor, then the element of the right child is received first. Because of the structure of the Fibonacci tree all processors send or receive elements while the "pipeline" is filled. The pipeline is filled from the point where each unit has received an element and until the leaf units have no more elements to send.

=== Runtime ===
Each iteration of the algorithm takes at most time &lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{m} \cdot T_{byte} + T_{start}&lt;/math&gt;. The height of the tree factors into the time it needs to fill the pipeline and for Fibonacci trees it is known to be about &lt;math&gt;h = log_{\phi}p&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is the golden ratio. Once the pipeline is filled, all processors are active in each step. Because inner nodes have two children, they have to receive &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot m&lt;/math&gt; elements. Therefore, the runtime of the algorithm is &lt;math&gt;T(n,p,m) \approx (\frac{n}{m} \cdot T_{byte} + T_{start})(h + 2 \cdot k - 2)&lt;/math&gt;. It is minimal if the number of elements in a vector is chosen such that &lt;math&gt;m = \sqrt{\frac{n \cdot (h-3)T_{byte}}{3 \cdot T_{start}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==
Reduction is one of the main collective operations implemented in the [[Message Passing Interface]], where performance of the used algorithm is important and evaluated constantly for different use cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pješivac-Grbović|first=Jelena|last2=Angskun|first2=Thara|last3=Bosilca|first3=George|last4=Fagg|first4=Graham E.|last5=Gabriel|first5=Edgar|last6=Dongarra|first6=Jack J.|date=2007-06-01|title=Performance analysis of MPI collective operations|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-007-0012-0|journal=Cluster Computing|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=127–143|doi=10.1007/s10586-007-0012-0|issn=1386-7857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''subsequence''' is a [[sequence]] that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,D \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is a subsequence of &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,C,D,E,F \rangle &lt;/math&gt; obtained after removal of elements &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of another is a [[preorder]].

The subsequence should not be confused with [[substring]] &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,C,D \rangle &lt;/math&gt; which can be derived from the above [[string (computer science)|string]] &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,C,D,E,F \rangle &lt;/math&gt; by deleting substring &lt;math&gt; \langle E,F \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. The substring is a refinement of the subsequence. 

The list of all subsequences for the word "'''apple'''" would be "'''a, ap, al, ae, app, apl, ape, ale, appl, appe, aple, apple, p, pp, pl, pe, ppl, ppe, ple, pple, l, le, e'''". 

== Common subsequence ==

Given two sequences ''X'' and ''Y'', a sequence ''Z'' is said to be a ''common subsequence'' of ''X'' and ''Y'', if ''Z'' is a subsequence of both ''X'' and ''Y''.  For example, if

:&lt;math&gt; X = \langle A,C,B,D,E,G,C,E,D,B,G \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; Y = \langle B,E,G,C,F,E,U,B,K \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

then a common subsequence of ''X'' and ''Y'' could be

:&lt;math&gt; Z = \langle B,E,E \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

This would ''not'' be the ''[[Longest-common subsequence problem|longest common subsequence]]'', since ''Z'' only has length 3, and the common subsequence &lt;math&gt; \langle B,E,E,B \rangle &lt;/math&gt; has length&amp;nbsp;4. The longest common subsequence of ''X'' and ''Y'' is &lt;math&gt; \langle B,E,G,C,E,B \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
Subsequences have applications to [[computer science]],&lt;ref name="substrVsSubseq"&gt;In computer science, ''[[string (computer science)|string]]'' is often used as a synonym for ''sequence'', but it is important to note that ''[[substring]]'' and ''subsequence'' are not synonyms. Substrings are ''consecutive'' parts of a string, while subsequences need not be. This means that a substring of a string is always a subsequence of the string, but a subsequence of a string is not always a substring of the string, see: {{cite book | last = Gusfield | first = Dan | origyear = 1997 | year = 1999 | title = Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences: Computer Science and Computational Biology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = USA | isbn = 0-521-58519-8 | pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the discipline of [[bioinformatics]], where computers are used to compare, analyze, and store [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]] sequences.

Take two sequences of DNA containing 37 elements, say:

:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ACGGTGTCGTGCTATGCTGATGCTGACTTATATGCTA&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = CGTTCGGCTATCGTACGTTCTATTCTATGATTTCTAA&lt;/tt&gt;

The longest common subsequence of sequences 1 and 2 is:

:&lt;tt&gt;LCS&lt;sub&gt;(SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = '''CGTTCGGCTATGCTTCTACTTATTCTA'''&lt;/tt&gt;

This can be illustrated by highlighting the 27 elements of the longest common subsequence into the initial sequences:

:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = A'''{{font color|red|CG}}'''G'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|TCG}}'''T'''{{font color|red|GCTATGCT}}'''GA'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|CT}}'''G'''{{font color|red|ACTTAT}}'''A'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|CTA}}'''&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''{{font color|red|CGTTCGGCTAT}}'''C'''{{font color|red|G}}'''TA'''{{font color|red|C}}'''G'''{{font color|red|TTCTA}}'''TT'''{{font color|red|CT}}'''A'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|ATT}}'''T'''{{font color|red|CTA}}'''A&lt;/tt&gt;

Another way to show this is to ''align'' the two sequences, ''i.e.'', to position elements of the longest common subsequence in a same column (indicated by the vertical bar) and to introduce a special character (here, a dash) in one sequence when two elements in the same column differ:
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ACGGTGTCGTGCTAT-G--C-TGATGCTGA--CT-T-ATATG-CTA-&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|||&amp;nbsp;|||||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||| &lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -C-GT-TCG-GCTATCGTACGT--T-CT-ATTCTATGAT-T-TCTAA&lt;/tt&gt;

Subsequences are used to determine how similar the two strands of DNA are, using the DNA bases: [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]].

== Theorems ==
* Every infinite sequence of real numbers has an infinite [[monotone sequence|monotone]] subsequence (This is a lemma used in the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem#Proof|proof of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]]).
* Every infinite [[bounded sequence]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; has a convergent subsequence (This is the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]]).
* For all integers ''r'' and ''s'', every finite sequence of length at least (''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)(''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 contains a monotonically increasing subsequence of length&amp;nbsp;''r'' ''or'' a monotonically decreasing subsequence of length&amp;nbsp;''s'' (This is the [[Erdős–Szekeres theorem]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4203">"'''The unexamined life is not worth living'''" ({{lang-grc|ὁ ... ἀνεξέταστος βίος οὐ βιωτὸς ἀνθρώπῳ}}) is a famous [[dictum]] apparently uttered by [[Socrates]] at [[Trial of Socrates|his trial]] for [[impiety]] and corrupting youth, for which he was subsequently sentenced to death, as described in Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' (38a5–6).

==Rationale==

This statement relates to Socrates' understanding and attitude towards [[death]] and his commitment to fulfill his goal of investigating and understanding the [[List of oracular statements from Delphi#440 BC|statement of the Pythia]]. Socrates understood the [[Pythia]]'s response to [[Chaerephon]]'s question as a communication from the god [[Apollo]] and this became Socrates's prime directive, his ''[[wikt:raison d'etre|raison d'etre]]''. For Socrates, to be separated from [[Socratic method#Method|elenchus]] by exile (preventing him from investigating the statement) was therefore a fate worse than death. Since Socrates was religious and trusted his religious experiences, such as his guiding [[Daemon (classical mythology)#Socrates|daimonic voice]], he accordingly preferred to continue to seek the truth to the answer to his question, in the after-life, than live a life not identifying the answer on earth.&lt;ref name="BrickhouseSmith1994"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Thomas C. |last1=Brickhouse|first2=Nicholas D. |last2=Smith|title=Plato's Socrates|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-JQtKIrFuq0C|page=201}}|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510111-9|pages=201–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==

The words were supposedly spoken by Socrates at [[Trial of Socrates|his trial]] after he chose death rather than exile. They represent (in modern terms) the noble choice, that is, the choice of death in the face of an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Baggini - [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/may/12/features11.g24 Wisdom's folly] ''The Guardian newspaper'' (Guardian News and Media Limited)  Thursday 12 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
{{Also|Trial of Socrates#Interpretations of the trial of Socrates}}

Socrates believed that philosophy&amp;nbsp;– ''the love of wisdom''&amp;nbsp;– was the most important pursuit above all else. For some, he exemplifies more than anyone else in history the pursuit of wisdom through questioning and logical argument, by examining and by thinking. His 'examination' of life in this way spilled out into the lives of others, such that they began their own 'examination' of life, but he knew they would all die one day, as saying that a life without philosophy&amp;nbsp;– an 'unexamined' life&amp;nbsp;– was not worth living.&lt;ref name="SpiveySquire2011"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Nigel |last1=Spivey|first2=Michael |last2=Squire|title=Panorama of the Classical World|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=uNKEFjcYc-0C|page=230}}|date=1 March 2011|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-1-60606-056-8|pages=230–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.M.

A '''tolerance interval''' is a [[statistical interval]] within which, with some confidence level, a specified proportion of a sampled population falls. "More specifically, a 100×p%/100×(1−α) tolerance interval provides limits within which at least a certain proportion (p) of the population falls with a given level of confidence (1−α)."&lt;ref&gt;D. S. Young (2010), Book Reviews: "Statistical Tolerance Regions: Theory, Applications, and Computation", TECHNOMETRICS, FEBRUARY 2010, VOL. 52, NO. 1, pp.143-144.&lt;/ref&gt; "A (p, 1−α) tolerance interval (TI) based on a sample is constructed so that it would include at least a proportion p of the sampled population with confidence 1−α; such a TI is usually referred to as p-content − (1−α) coverage TI."&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy2011&gt;Krishnamoorthy, K. and Lian, Xiaodong(2011) 'Closed-form approximate tolerance intervals for some general linear models and comparison studies', Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation,, First published on: 13 June 2011 {{DOI|10.1080/00949655.2010.545061}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A (p, 1−α) upper '''tolerance limit''' (TL) is simply an 1−α upper [[confidence limit]] for the 100 p [[percentile]] of the population."&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy2011/&gt;

A tolerance interval can be seen as a statistical version of a [[probability interval]]. "In the parameters-known case, a 95% tolerance interval and a 95% [[prediction interval]] are the same."&lt;ref name="Ryan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas P. Ryan|title=Modern Engineering Statistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZn7XNphKcgC&amp;pg=PA222|accessdate=22 February 2013|date=22 June 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-12843-5|pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt; If we knew a population's exact parameters, we would be able to compute a range within which a certain proportion of the population falls. For example, if we know a population is [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] with [[mean]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then the interval &lt;math&gt;\mu \pm 1.96\sigma&lt;/math&gt; includes 95% of the population (1.96 is the [[z-score]] for 95% coverage of a normally distributed population).

However, if we have only a sample from the population, we know only the [[sample mean]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and sample standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;, which are only estimates of the true parameters. In that case, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu} \pm 1.96\hat{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; will not necessarily include 95% of the population, due to variance in these estimates. A tolerance interval bounds this variance by introducing a confidence level &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, which is the confidence with which this interval actually includes the specified proportion of the population. For a normally distributed population, a z-score can be transformed into a "''k'' factor" or '''tolerance factor'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Statistical interpretation of data — Part 6: Determination of statistical tolerance intervals |publisher= ISO 16269-6|year= 2005 |page= 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a given &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; via lookup tables or several approximation formulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Tolerance intervals for a normal distribution | url = http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc263.htm | title = Engineering Statistics Handbook | publisher = NIST/Sematech | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As the degrees of freedom approach infinity, the prediction and tolerance intervals become equal."&lt;ref name=Example2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = De Gryze | first1 = S. | last2 = Langhans | first2 = I. | last3 = Vandebroek | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1016/j.chemolab.2007.03.002 | title = Using the correct intervals for prediction: A tutorial on tolerance intervals for ordinary least-squares regression | journal = Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 147 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other intervals==
{{Main|Interval estimation}}
The tolerance interval is less widely known than the [[confidence interval]] and [[prediction interval]], a situation some educators have lamented, as it can lead to misuse of the other intervals where a tolerance interval is more appropriate.&lt;ref name=vardeman&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stephen B. Vardeman | title = What about the Other Intervals? | journal = The American Statistician | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | year = 1992 | pages = 193–197 | jstor = 2685212 | doi=10.2307/2685212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;{{cite web | author = Mark J. Nelson | title = You might want a tolerance interval | url = http://www.kmjn.org/notes/tolerance_intervals.html | date = 2011-08-14 | accessdate = 2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tolerance interval differs from a [[confidence interval]] in that the confidence interval bounds a single-valued population parameter (the [[mean]] or the [[variance]], for example) with some confidence, while the tolerance interval bounds the range of data values that includes a specific proportion of the population. Whereas a confidence interval's size is entirely due to [[sampling error]], and will approach a zero-width interval at the true population parameter as sample size increases, a tolerance interval's size is due partly to sampling error and partly to actual variance in the population, and will approach the population's probability interval as sample size increases.&lt;ref name=vardeman /&gt;&lt;ref name=nelson /&gt;

The tolerance interval is related to a [[prediction interval]] in that both put bounds on variation in future samples. The prediction interval only bounds a single future sample, however, whereas a tolerance interval bounds the entire population (equivalently, an arbitrary sequence of future samples). In other words, a prediction interval covers a specified proportion of a population ''on average'', whereas a tolerance interval covers it ''with a certain confidence level'', making the tolerance interval more appropriate if a single interval is intended to bound multiple future samples.&lt;ref name=nelson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy&gt;{{cite book | author = K. Krishnamoorthy| title = Statistical Tolerance Regions: Theory, Applications, and Computation | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-470-38026-8 | pages = 1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

&lt;ref name=vardeman/&gt; gives the following example: &lt;blockquote&gt;So consider once again a proverbial [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] [[Fuel economy in automobiles|mileage]] test scenario, in which several nominally identical autos of a particular model are tested to produce mileage figures &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n&lt;/math&gt;. If such data are processed to produce a 95% confidence interval for the mean mileage of the model, it is, for example, possible to use it to project the mean or total gasoline consumption for the manufactured fleet of such autos over their first 5,000 miles of use. Such an interval, would however, not be of much help to a person renting one of these cars and wondering whether the (full) 10-gallon tank of gas will suffice to carry him the 350 miles to his destination. For that job, a prediction interval would be much more useful. (Consider the differing implications of being "95% sure" that &lt;math&gt;\mu \ge 35&lt;/math&gt; as opposed to being "95% sure" that &lt;math&gt;y_{n+1} \ge 35&lt;/math&gt;.) But neither a confidence interval for &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; nor a prediction interval for a single additional mileage is exactly what is needed by a design engineer charged with determining how large a gas tank the model really needs to guarantee that 99% of the autos produced will have a 400-mile cruising range. What the engineer really needs is a tolerance interval for a fraction &lt;math&gt;p = .99&lt;/math&gt; of mileages of such autos.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is given by:&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The air lead levels were collected from &lt;math&gt;n=15&lt;/math&gt; different areas within the facility. It was noted that the log-transformed lead levels fitted a normal distribution well (that is, the data are from a [[lognormal distribution]]. Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, denote the population mean and variance for the log-transformed data. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denotes the corresponding random variable, we thus have &lt;math&gt;X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt;. We note that exp(mu) is the median air lead level. A confidence interval for mu can be constructed the usual way, based on the [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]]; this in turn will provide a confidence interval for the median air lead level. If &lt;math&gt;\bar{X}&lt;/math&gt; and S denote the sample mean and standard deviation of the log-transformed data for a sample of size n, a 95% confidence interval for mu is given by &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} \pm t_{n-1,0.975} S / \sqrt(n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t_{m,1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the 1-alpha quantile of a [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]] with m degrees of freedom. It may also be of interest to derive a 95% upper confidence bound for the median air lead level. Such a bound for mu is given by &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} + t_{n-1,0.95} S / \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, a 95% upper confidence bound for the median air lead is given by &lt;math&gt;\exp{\left( \bar{X} + t_{n-1,0.95} S / \sqrt{n} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;. Now suppose we want to predict the air lead level at a particular area within the laboratory. A 95% upper prediction limit for the log-transformed lead level is given by &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} + t_{n-1,0.95} S \sqrt{\left( 1 + 1/n \right)}&lt;/math&gt;. A two-sided prediction interval can be similarly computed. The meaning and interpretation of these intervals are well known. For example, if the confidence interval &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} \pm t_{n-1,0.975} S / \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; is computed repeatedly from independent samples, 95% of the intervals so computed will include the true value of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, in the long run. In other words, the interval is meant to provide information concerning the parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; only. A prediction interval has a similar interpretation, and is meant to provide information concerning a single lead level only. Now suppose we want to use the sample to conclude whether or not at least 95% of the population lead levels are below a threshold. The confidence interval and prediction interval cannot answer this question, since the confidence interval is only for the median lead level, and the prediction interval is only for a single lead level. What is required is a tolerance interval; more specifically, an upper tolerance limit. The upper tolerance limit is to be computed subject to the condition that at least 95% of the population lead levels is below the limit, with a certain confidence level, say 99%.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Calculation==
One-sided normal tolerance intervals have an exact solution in terms of the sample mean and sample variance based on the [[Noncentral t-distribution|noncentral ''t''-distribution]].&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; 
Two-sided normal tolerance intervals can be obtained based on the [[noncentral chi-squared distribution]].&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite journal| author=Derek S.

== Debate about inclusion of transgender people in the military ==
{{Globalize|section|date=November 2017}}

=== Arguments against inclusion ===

There are arguments against the inclusion of transgender people in military service. One argument is based on the view that being transgender is a [[mental illness]], and as such transgender individuals are unfit for service.&lt;ref name="hcss"/&gt; This argument follows a high incidence of depression and suicide manifest in transgender individuals. This is especially pertinent in individuals who have had [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex-reassignment surgery]] and are unsatisfied with the results; in such cases severe depression is prevalent.&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"&gt;Clements T.I., Wicks R.E.,"Transsexualism and Flight Safety" ''Aerospace Medicine Branch Education'' USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks Air Force Base, Texas [http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a229995.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hormone therapy]] can affect mood and a sense of well-being, a factor that counts against inclusion of transgender people and its effect on service capability.&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"/&gt; Besides the well-being argument of hormone treatment, complications may arise due to hormone treatments. Possible complications arising from [[estrogen]] and [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] therapies include an increased risk of [[thromboembolic disease]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[breast cancer]], fertility problems, [[stroke]], abnormal liver function, [[renal disease]], [[endometrial cancer]], and [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name="loc.gov"&gt;Major Bunn S.A., ''Straight talk: The implications of repealing "Don't ask, Don't tell" and the rationale for preserving aspects of the current policy'' 203 MIL. L Rev. 207, 236 (2010) [https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/Military_Law_Review/pdf-files/203-spring-2010.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these could cause significant issues to effective military service, especially when deployed in remote areas or in field training settings.

A further argument is that in order to have an effective, smooth-running military, there must be cohesion within the unit. It is argued that transgender individuals would have a negative impact on unit cohesion. "The bonds of trust among individual service members" are vital.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan D., Rosenmann A, ''Unit social cohesion in the Israeli military as a case study of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'' 33 Pol. Psychol. 419, 422 (2012)l&lt;/ref&gt; There is a fear that if transgender personnel be allowed to serve openly, morale will be detrimentally affected. But this argument neglects to deal with the question of what kinds of structural accommodations might be needed to maintain morale and unit cohesion in such situations. Military service forces members into very intimate living quarters. Requiring members to live in situations that make them feel disconcerted and uncomfortable may result in their performance being undermined.&lt;ref name="hcss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt; The logistics of accommodating a group of individuals with such varying degrees of gender representation would be staggering. The costs alone of allowing transgender people to serve counts heavily against inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Needs Citation&lt;/ref&gt; Not only logistically and structurally, but also in medical costs. It is estimated that a male-to-female transition can cost between US$7,000 and $24,000; female-to-male transition can exceed US$50,000.&lt;ref name="Sex Reassignment Surgery"&gt;''[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Pa-St/Sex-Reassignment-Surgery.html Sex Reassignment Surgery]'' Encyclopaedia of Surgery, Retrieved 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Which, depending on policy, the military may have to fund.

=== Arguments for inclusion ===

By excluding a demographic from equal service, militaries are overtly intensifying the stigma of that group's civic inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;Binkin M., Eitelberg M.j., ''Blacks and the military,'' (1982) Washington, DC, Brookings Institution&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by the notion that all citizens are obligated to serve their nations if the need arises.&lt;ref&gt;Herek G.M., "Sexual orientation and military service: A social science perspective," ''American Psychologist'' 48, no. 5 (1993) pp. 538-549&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing transgender military personnel to serve openly without fear of exclusion would be a huge step toward equality. It has been recognized by some academics that the inclusion of all LGBT personnel in the military is more than a mere human rights issue, it is argued that for militaries to survive in the twenty-first century diversity is critical.&lt;ref name="hcss"/&gt;

With advancements in the current understanding of human experience, sexual identity is now better understood. Where being transgender was once considered a [[paraphilic disorder]], the current [[DSM V|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] places being transgender in a separate chapter, terming the condition [[gender dysphoria]]. It is argued that militaries that exclude transgender people on grounds of mental illness, whose policies pathologize gender dysphoria, are at odds with the current medical understanding. This argument requires that transgender personnel be treated by the same level of medical care as all other personnel, in accordance with established medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gale S.P. (co-chair), Shannon M. (co-chair), "Report of the Planning Commission on Transgender Military Service" ''A nonpartisan national commission offering implementation guidance for the inclusion of openly-serving transgender personnel in the US military'' (Aug 2014) Palm Centre Blueprints for sound public policy&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts argue that there is absolutely no empirical evidence that supports the argument that transgender people are unfit for service. Often cited are factors such as a supposed predisposition of transgender individuals to problems such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts; this is countered by the prevalence of these same issues in the LGB community, yet in many countries their service is not excluded.&lt;ref&gt;King M. et al., "A systematic review of mental disorder, suicide, and deliberate self harm in lesbian, gay and bisexual people," ''BMC Psychiatry'' 8 (2008) pp. 1-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://lgbtpov.frontiersla.com/2012/10/24/carpenter-why-lgb-people-should-care-about-trans-bias-in-the-military/ ''Carpenter: Why LGB people should care about trans bias in the military'']'' Tom Carpenter &amp; Karen Ocamb, LGBt POV, (24 October 2012) Retrieved 28 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; By creating a more accepting environment, distress that transgender personnel feel might be mitigated if they may serve openly with full support.&lt;ref&gt;Ross A., "The Invisible Army: Why the military needs to rescind its ban on transgender service members" 23 ''S. Cal. Interdisc. L.J.'' (2014) p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst militaries often cite the high medical cost of transgender people, they fail to reconcile this argument with current standards with other service members. For example, militaries often allow hormone treatments for an array of reasons and conditions, besides gender dysphoria; a common hormone treatment being contraceptive. Furthermore, the often cited risks of cross hormone treatment are rare,&lt;ref&gt;Asscheman H. et al., "A long-term follow up study of mortality in transsexual receiving treatment with cross-sex hormones," ''European Journal of Endocrinology'' 164, 4 (2011) pp. 635&lt;/ref&gt; and not likely to cause any significant issues to the military. Whilst the cost of gender reassignment surgery is high,&lt;ref name="Sex Reassignment Surgery"/&gt; it is suggested that fewer than 2% of transgender members per year will choose to undergo gender reassignment surgery.&lt;ref name="Elders"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elders |first=M.

The 18 confirmed cases are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps one of the most supporting arguments is based on the experiences of the 18 countries that currently allow transgender service. Research on the impacts of allowing LGBT to serve openly in the [[Israel Defense Forces#LGBT people|Israeli Defense Forces]], [[Sexual orientation and the military of the United Kingdom|British Armed Forces]], and [[Sexual orientation and the Canadian military|Canadian Armed Forces]] found no necessary negative impacts on performance, unit cohesion or morality.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin A., Levitt M., "Homosexuality and the Israel Defense Forces: Did Lifting the Gay Ban Undermine Military Performance?," 27 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' 4 ( 2001) p. 544; Belkin and Evans, "The Effects of Including Gay and Lesbian Soldiers in the British Armed Forces," 4; Belkin A., McNichol J., "Homosexual Personnel Policy in the Canadian Forces: Did Lifting the Gay Ban Undermine Military Performance?," 56 ''Canadian International Journal'' 1 (2000) p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of unit cohesion can also be demonstrated by a social study conducted less than one year prior to the repeal of the ban preventing transgender personnel from serving openly in the United States military. Morten G. Ender, David E. Rohall, and Michael D. Matthews presented the American military academy, Reserve Officers Training Corps, and civilian undergraduates with a survey to assess the general attitude on the prospect of the transgender community serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. After statistical analysis, 50.8% of individuals disagreed with the ban. In regards to productivity, 72.6% of subjects say that transgender inclusion would have no impact on their ability to do their job. Finally, on the subject of visibility, 21.8% of those interviewed said they would want transgender individuals to tell them their gender preferences, 56.1% said no preference. Overall, based on this study one year prior to the ban, the majority of the people that participated in the survey showed overwhelming support towards the inclusion of the transgender community in the United States military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ender|first1=Morton G.|last2=Matthews|first2=Michael D.|last3=Rohall|first3=David E.|title=Cadet and Civilian Undergraduate Attitudes toward Transgender People|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|date=2016|volume=42.2|pages=427–435}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2017, ruling that a renewed ban within the US military should not go into force, US District Judge [[Colleen Kollar-Kotelly]] stated that the evidence presented up to that time showed that ''"all of the reasons proffered ... for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this case were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions and judgment of the military itself"''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-transgender-20171030-story.html|title=Federal court blocks Trump's ban on transgender people in the military|first=W.

In France, the military is sometimes initially more accepting of transgender service members than civilian authorities are, at least in some localities and jurisdictions, but they are also influenced by rulings of civilian courts which have strict requirements about changing identity documents. One service member was whipsawed by initially positive reception in the military, later overruled after a civilian court decision.

In 2009, a transgender [[Adjutant#France|Adjutant]] in the [[French Air Force]] who had already served 18 years as a man, returned to her unit in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] as a woman after a sick leave. Her superiors took stock of the situation, and provided the necessary uniforms and military papers with her new name. Delphine Ravisé-Giard was reintegrated into the military smoothly and without incident. On the other hand, she had difficulties in civilian life, such as when presenting her driver's license, passport, or other papers. The military then issued a request to the Nancy {{ill|Tribunal de grande instance (France)|fr||lt=District Court}} to have her gender and name altered on her birth certificate, but their decision was negative based on the fact that she had not yet undergone [[sex reassignment surgery]] so her situation was reversible. A 1992 decision by the ''[[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]]'' (Court of Appeals) requires those wishing to change their legal documents to show proof of being diagnosed with "transsexual syndrome" which is listed as a long-term psychiatric disorder in France, and to have undergone surgical intervention, but the Adjutant declared that she had no "long-term psychiatric disorder", and any question about any surgical interventions she had or didn't have was her private affair. Her lawyer insinuated that the real reason for the denial had to do with her ability to still have a child, and that the court's objective was sterilization before they would accord a legal name and gender change. The [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] of the [[European Council]] said that a transgender person "seeking to have their gender identity legally recognized should not be forced to submit to sterilization or to any other medical treatment."&lt;ref name=Tissier-2009&gt;{{cite web |language=French |last1=Tissier |first1=Julia |date=13 August 2009 |title=Femme à l’armée, homme au civil |trans-title=In the Army, a Woman; to City Hall, a Man |url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2009/08/13/femme-a-l-armee-homme-au-civil_575661 |website=[[Libération]] |location=Paris |accessdate=3 November 2017 |subscription= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in December, following the District Court decision, [[Hervé Morin]], the [[Minister of Defense (France)|Minister of Defense]], ordered her to turn in her military papers, which she did. Meanwhile, she discovered that the name on her pay stub reverted to her old name, that the military supplement that women service members receive for feminine undergarments had been removed, and that the military was even going to dock her pay for the supplement she received while serving two years as a woman.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |language=French |last1=Mercier |first1=Philippe |date=11 February 2010 |title=Nancy: militaire transgenre au rapport |trans-title=Transgender Soldier On Report |url=http://www.estrepublicain.fr/actualite/2010/02/11/nancy-militaire-transgenre-au-rapport |website=[[L'Est Républicain]] |issn=1760-4958 |publisher=Societe Du Journal L'est Republicain |location=Nancy |accessdate=3 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, Iran requires all male citizens over age 18 to serve in the military, but transgender women, who are classified as having mental disorders. New military identity cards listed the subsection of the law dictating this exemption. This practice of identifying transgender individuals put them at risk of physical abuse and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277485.pdf IRAN 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, identity documents may not be changed. All males must show up for the military conscription event on draft day, and [[kathoey]]s are not exempt from this requirement. It is possible for [[kathoey]]s to get an exemption certificate that will allow them to avoid service, but they must still attend, in order to present the document and be dismissed. As a result, on draft day, lines of people awaiting processing may include transgender women in makeup and feminine attire, waiting along with the male draftees. Contrary to the wide impression of acceptance of transgender women in Thailand, many complain about being treated as second-class citizens, and of the stress of being undressed or publicly humiliated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transsexuals are forced to stand in line for army conscription in dresses and skirts as 100,000 21-year-old men are drafted into the Thai military |last1= |first1= |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4381806/Trans-women-forced-army-conscription-Thailand.html |date=5 April 2017 |website=Mail Online |publisher=[[Associated Newspapers Ltd]] |accessdate=3 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nightmare looms for transgender Thais at army draft |last1=Tanakasempipat |first1=Patpicha |last2=Kittisilpa |first2=Juarawee |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-armydraft/nightmare-looms-for-transgender-thais-at-army-draft-idUSKBN1780FS |date=5 April 2017 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher= |accessdate=3 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Transgender personnel in the United States military}}
The United States' military policy previously allowed for exclusion of transgender people from service on medical grounds. While gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members were allowed to serve openly since 2011, transgender service members risked discharge if they did not pass as their assigned sex. This required that service members conceal their gender identities throughout service.&lt;ref&gt;Ross A., "The invisible army: why the military needs to rescind its ban on transgender service members," ''Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal'' 23 (2014) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38179">The '''Violence Against Women Act of 1994''' ('''VAWA''') is a [[United States federal law]] (Title IV, sec. 40001-40703 of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], {{USBill|103|hr|3355}}) signed as {{USPL|103|322}} by [[US President|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on September 13, 1994 (codified in part at 42 U.S.C. sections 13701 through 14040). The Act provided $1.6 billion toward investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women, imposed automatic and mandatory restitution on those convicted, and allowed civil redress in cases prosecutors chose to leave un-prosecuted. The Act also established the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] within the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

VAWA was drafted by the office of [[U.S. Senator|Senator]] [[Joe Biden]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Delaware|DE]]) and co-written by Democrat [[Louise Slaughter]], the Representative from New York, with support from a broad coalition of advocacy groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/2014_vawa_report.pdf]|title=Report: 1 Is Too Many: Twenty Years Fighting Violence Against Women and Girls from The White House|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act passed through [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] with bipartisan support in 1994, clearing the [[United States House of Representatives]] by a vote of 235–195 and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by a vote of 61–38, although the following year House [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] attempted to cut the Act's funding.&lt;ref name="wp-funding"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Washington Post]] | title = House GOP Budget Cutters Try to Limit Domestic Violence Programs | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18605326.html?dids=18605326:18605326&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+15%2C+1995&amp;author=Kenneth+J.+Cooper&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=House+GOP+Budget+Cutters+Try+to+Limit+Domestic+Violence+Programs | first = Kenneth | last = Cooper | accessdate = April 19, 2012 | date = July 15, 1995 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120724235532/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18605326.html?dids=18605326:18605326&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+15%2C+1995&amp;author=Kenneth+J.+Cooper&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=House+GOP+Budget+Cutters+Try+to+Limit+Domestic+Violence+Programs | archivedate = July 24, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000 [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case ''[[United States v.

VAWA was reauthorized by bipartisan majorities in Congress in 2000 (H.R. 1248, Roll Call 415-3), and again in December 2005, and signed by President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=January 5, 2006|title=President Signs H.R. 3402, the "Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005"|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/20060105-3.html|publisher=George W.

==Background==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2018}}
The [[World Conference on Human Rights]], held in Vienna, Austria, in 1993, and the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in the same year, concluded that civil society and governments have acknowledged that [[domestic violence]] is a public health policy and [[human rights]] concern. In the United States, according to the National Intimate Partner Sexual Violence Survey of 2010 1 in 6 women suffered some kind of [[Sexual violence by intimate partners|sexual violence]] induced by their intimate partner during the course of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Black, M. C. et al. ''[http://www.niwrc.org/sites/default/files/documents/Resources/Stalking-report2010.pdf The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 Summary Report]''. Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Violence Against Women Act was developed and passed as a result of extensive grassroots efforts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with advocates and professionals from the battered women's movement, sexual assault advocates, victim services field, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors' offices, the courts, and the private bar urging Congress to adopt significant legislation to address domestic and sexual violence [citation needed]. One of the greatest successes of VAWA is its emphasis on a coordinated community response to domestic violence, sex dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; courts, law enforcement, prosecutors, victim services, and the private bar currently work together in a coordinated effort that did not exist before at the state and local levels [citation needed].  VAWA also supports the work of community-based organizations that are engaged in work to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; particularly those groups that provide culturally and linguistically specific services. Additionally, VAWA provides specific support for work with tribes and tribal organizations to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking against Native American women.

Many grant programs authorized in VAWA have been funded by the U.S. Congress. The following grant programs, which are administered primarily through the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] in the U.S. Department of Justice have received appropriations from Congress:

* STOP Grants (State Formula Grants)
* Transitional Housing Grants
* Grants to Encourage Arrest and Enforce Protection Orders
* Court Training and Improvement Grants
* Research on Violence Against Native American Women
* National Tribal [[Sex offender registries in the United States|Sex Offender Registry]]
* Stalker Reduction Database
* Federal Victim Assistants
* Sexual Assault Services Program
* Services for Rural Victims
* Civil Legal Assistance for Victims
* Elder Abuse Grant Program
* Protections and Services for Disabled Victims
* Combating Abuse in Public Housing
* National Resource Center on Workplace Responses
* Violence on College Campuses Grants
* Safe Havens Project
* Engaging Men and Youth in Prevention

==Debate and legal standing==
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had originally expressed concerns about the Act, saying that the increased penalties were rash, that the increased pretrial detention was "repugnant" to the U.S. Constitution, that the mandatory HIV testing of those only charged but not convicted was an infringement of a citizen’s [[right to privacy]], and that the edict for automatic payment of full restitution was non-judicious (see their paper: "Analysis of Major Civil Liberties Abuses in the Crime Bill Conference Report as Passed by the House and the Senate", dated September 29, 1994). The ACLU has, however, supported reauthorization of VAWA on the condition that the "unconstitutional DNA provision" be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|url=https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;id=251&amp;page=UserAction |title=Tell Congress to Support the Violence Against Women Act|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051116000141/https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;id=251&amp;page=UserAction|archivedate=2005-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU, in its July 27, 2005 'Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197' stated that "VAWA is one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It has dramatically improved the law enforcement response to [[violence against women]] and has provided critical services necessary to support women in their struggle to overcome abusive situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACLU Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197|publisher=ACLU|date=July 27, 2005|url=https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130005/https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|archivedate=December 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some activists oppose the bill. Janice Shaw Course, a senior fellow at [[Concerned Women for America]]'s Beverly LaHaye Institute called the Act a "boondoggle" which "ends up creating a climate of suspicion where all men are feared or viewed as violent and all women are viewed as victims". She described the Act as creating a "climate of false accusations, rush to judgment and hidden agendas" and criticized it for failing to address the factors identified by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] as leading to violent, abusive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crouse |first=Janice Shaw |date=March 19, 2012 |title=The Violence Against Women Act Should Outrage Decent People |url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-violence-against-women-act-be-reauthorized/the-violence-against-women-act-should-outrage-decent-people |work=U.S. News and World Report |type=Opinion |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103052355/https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-violence-against-women-act-be-reauthorized/the-violence-against-women-act-should-outrage-decent-people |archivedate=November 3, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative activist [[Phyllis Schlafly]] denounced VAWA as a tool to "fill feminist coffers" and argued that the Act promoted "divorce, breakup of marriage and [[misandry|hatred of men]]".&lt;ref name="vawa-2012"/&gt;

In 2000, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held part of VAWA unconstitutional in ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' on federalism grounds. In that decision, only the civil rights remedy of VAWA was struck down. The provisions providing program funding were unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=529&amp;invol=598 United States v. Morrison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809185406/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=529&amp;invol=598 |date=2011-08-09 }}, 529 U.S. 598, 627;  "For these reasons, we conclude that Congress' power under § 5 does not extend to the enactment of § 13981.... The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed." (at end of opinion section III)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the reauthorization of VAWA (as HR3402) defined what population benefited under the term of "Underserved Populations" described as " Populations underserved because of geographic location, underserved racial and ethnic populations, populations underserved because of special needs (such as language barriers, disabilities, alienage status, or age) and any other population determined to be underserved by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] or by the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] as appropriate".&lt;ref name="Olivares, Mariela 2014"&gt;Olivares, Mariela. 2014.

In 2011, the law expired.&lt;ref name="USAT021213" /&gt; In 2012 the law was up for reauthorization in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolduan|first=Kate|title=House passes GOP version of Violence Against Women Act renewal|newspaper=CNN|location=Washington|date=16 May 2012|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/16/politics/gop-violence-against-women/index.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623034529/http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/16/politics/gop-violence-against-women/index.html|archivedate=23 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different versions of the legislation have been passed along party lines in the Senate and House, with the Republican-sponsored House version favoring the reduction of services to undocumented immigrants and [[LGBT]] individuals. Another area of contention is the provision of the law giving Native American tribal authorities jurisdiction over sex crimes involving non-Native Americans on tribal lands. This provision is considered to have constitutional implications,{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} as non-tribes people are under the jurisdiction of the United States federal government and are granted the protections of the U.S. Constitution, protections that tribal courts do not often have. The two bills were pending [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation]], and a final bill did not reach the President's desk before the end of the year, temporarily ending the coverage of the Act after 18 years, as the 112th Congress adjourned.

The Act's 2012 renewal was opposed by [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republicans, who objected to extending the Act's protections to [[same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] and to provisions allowing battered undocumented individuals to claim [[visa (document)|temporary visas]], also known as [[U visa]]s.&lt;ref name="vawa-2012"&gt;{{cite news | last = Weisman | first = Jonathan | date = March 14, 2012 | title = Women Figure Anew in Senate's Latest Battle | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-divides-senate.html | work = The New York Times | accessdate = April 19, 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120430025641/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-divides-senate.html | archivedate = April 30, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U visa is restricted to 10,000 applicants annually whereas the number of applicants far exceeds these 10,000 for each fiscal year.&lt;ref name="Olivares, Mariela 2014"/&gt; In order to be considered for the U visa, one of the requirements for immigrant women is that they need to cooperate in the detention of the abuser.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Susan. 2009.

In April 2012, the Senate voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and the House subsequently passed its own measure (omitting provisions of the Senate bill that would protect gays, Native Americans living in reservations, and immigrants who are victims of domestic violence). Reconciliation of the two bills was stymied by procedural measures, leaving the re-authorization in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = New York Times | first = Jennifer | last = Steinhauer | title = THE CAUCUS; G.O.P.

In 2013, the question of jurisdiction over offenses in Indian country continued to be at issue over the question of whether defendants who are not tribal members would be treated fairly by [[tribal court]]s or afforded constitutional guarantees.&lt;ref name=NYT021013&gt;{{cite news|title=Measure to Protect Women Stuck on Tribal Land Issue|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-held-up-by-tribal-land-issue.html|accessdate=February 10, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 10, 2013|author=Jonathan Weisman|quote=If a Native American is raped or assaulted by a non-Indian, she must plead for justice to already overburdened United States attorneys who are often hundreds of miles away.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211132940/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-held-up-by-tribal-land-issue.html|archivedate=February 11, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2013, in a 286–138 vote, the House passed the Senate's all-inclusive version of the bill. House Republicans had previously hoped to pass their own version of the measure—one that substantially weakened the bill's protections for certain categories. The stripped down version, which allowed only limited protection for LGBT and Native Americans, was rejected 257 to 166.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=VAWA victory shows that House GOP needs Democrats |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/28/vawa-victory-shows-that-house-gop-needs-democrats |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=28 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301200809/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/28/vawa-victory-shows-that-house-gop-needs-democrats/ |archivedate=1 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The renewed act expanded federal protections to gay, lesbian, and [[transgender]] individuals, Native Americans and immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress sends Violence Against Women Act to Obama|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/02/28/violence-against-women-congress-obama/1953527/?csp=breakingnews|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=28 February 2013|first1=Catalina|last1=Camia|date=February 28, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108114304/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/02/28/violence-against-women-congress-obama/1953527/?csp=breakingnews|archivedate=8 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LeTrent|first=Sarah|title=Violence Against Women Act shines a light on same-sex abuse|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/14/living/same-sex-domestic-violence-and-vawa|accessdate=May 2, 2013|date=March 14, 2013|work=CNN|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504200357/http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/14/living/same-sex-domestic-violence-and-vawa|archivedate=May 4, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ovw/legacy/2014/06/20/faqs-ngc-vawa.pdf|title=Nondiscrimination Grant Condition in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013|author=|date=|website=justice.gov|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329153023/https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ovw/legacy/2014/06/20/faqs-ngc-vawa.pdf|archivedate=29 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] signed the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 113-4, 127 Stat. 54 (March 7, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference of Catholic Bishops==

The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] opposed portions of the act that addressed the categories "[[sexual orientation]]" and "[[gender identity]]", calling the sections unnecessary to achieve equal protection of all persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=USCCB Committees Express Concerns Over Domestic Violence Legislation|url=http://www.usccb.org/news/2013/13-046.cfm|accessdate=May 2, 2013|newspaper=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|date=March 6, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511082127/http://www.usccb.org/news/2013/13-046.cfm|archivedate=May 11, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

138 House Republicans voted against the version of the act that became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h55|title=S. 47 (113th): Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 -- House Vote #55 -- Feb 28, 2013|author=|date=|website=GovTrack.us|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127204126/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h55|archivedate=27 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several, including [[Steve King]] (R-Iowa), [[Bill Johnson (Ohio politician)|Bill Johnson]] (R-Ohio), [[Tim Walberg]] (R-Michigan), [[Vicky Hartzler]] (R-Missouri), [[Keith Rothfus]] (R-Pennsylvania), and [[Timothy F. Murphy|Tim Murphy]] (R-Pennsylvania), claimed to have voted in favor of the act.

On September 12, 2013, at an event marking the 19th anniversary of the bill, Vice President [[Joe Biden]] criticized the Republicans who slowed the passage of the reauthorization of the act as being "this sort of Neanderthal crowd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biden: 'Neanderthal crowd' slowed VAWA renewal|url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/09/biden-neanderthal-crowd-slowed-vawa-renewal-172549.html|publisher=Politico|accessdate=17 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916055840/http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/09/biden-neanderthal-crowd-slowed-vawa-renewal-172549.html|archivedate=16 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Community violence prevention programs
* Protections for victims who are evicted from their homes because of events related to domestic violence or stalking
* Funding for victim assistance services, like rape crisis centers and hotlines
* Programs to meet the needs of immigrant women and women of different races or ethnicities

==Persons who are covered under VAWA immigration provisions==
VAWA allows for the possibility that certain individuals who might not otherwise be eligible for immigration benefits may petition for US permanent residency on the grounds of a close relationship with a US citizen or permanent resident who has been abusing them.  The following persons are eligible to benefit from the immigration provisions of VAWA:
* A wife or husband who has been abused by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident (Green Card holder) spouse. The petition will also cover the petitioner’s children under age 21.
* A child abused by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident parent. The petition can be filed by an abused child or by her parent on the child’s behalf. 
* A parent who has been abused by a U.S. citizen child who is at least 21 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VAWA: VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT|publisher=Givi Kutidze|date=November 2, 2016|url=http://www.us-counsel.com/green-card/vawa-violence-against-women-act/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206032636/http://www.us-counsel.com/green-card/vawa-violence-against-women-act/|archivedate=December 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage of male victims==
Although the title of the Act and the titles of its sections refer to victims of domestic violence as women, the operative text is gender-neutral, providing coverage for male victims as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994|number=H.R. 3355|language=English|date=1994|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr3355/text|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111230817/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr3355/text|archivedate=2014-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual organizations have not been successful in using VAWA to provide equal coverage for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franklin|first=Robert|title=VAWA must be reformed for domestic violence rates to come down|publisher=Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.|work=The Hill|date=February 4, 2013|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/280897-vawa-must-be-reformed-for-domestic-violence-rates-to-come-down|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202131901/http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/280897-vawa-must-be-reformed-for-domestic-violence-rates-to-come-down|archivedate=February 2, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law has twice been amended in attempts to address this situation.

is the belief that an [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] (or "deep-seated") negative response to some thing, idea, or practice should be interpreted as [[evidence]] for the [[intrinsic]]ally harmful or [[evil]] character of that thing. Furthermore, it refers to the notion that [[wisdom]] may manifest itself in feelings of [[disgust]] towards anything which lacks [[Goodness and value theory|goodness]] or wisdom, though the feelings or the reasoning of such 'wisdom' may not be immediately explicable through [[reason]].

==Origin and usage==
The term "wisdom of repugnance" was coined in 1997 by [[Leon Kass]], chairman (2001–2005) of the [[President's Council on Bioethics]], in an article in ''[[The New Republic]]'',&lt;ref name="Kass 1997"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Kass, Leon R.|title=The Wisdom of Repugnance|work=[[The New Republic]]|volume=216|issue=22 |date=June 2, 1997 |pages=17&amp;ndash;26|publisher=[[CanWest]]|location=[[Washington, DC]]|authorlink=Leon Kass}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later expanded into a further (2001) article in the same magazine,&lt;ref name="Kass 2001"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kass|first=Leon R|title=Preventing a Brave New World: Why We Should Ban Human Cloning Now|work=The New Republic|date=May 21, 2001|volume=224|issue=21|pages=30&amp;ndash;39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also incorporated into his 2002 book ''Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity''.&lt;ref name="Kass 2002"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kass|first=Leon R.|title=Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity|year=2002|publisher=Encounter Books|isbn=1-893554-55-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kass stated that disgust was not an argument ''per se'', but went on to say that "in crucial cases... repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate."

The term remains largely confined to discussions of [[bioethics]], and is somewhat related to the term "yuck factor". However, unlike the latter, it is used almost exclusively by those who accept its underlying premise; i.e., that repugnance does, in fact, indicate wisdom. It is thus often viewed as [[loaded language]], and is primarily used by certain [[Techno-progressivism#Contrasting stance|bioconservatives]] to justify their position.

The term has since migrated to other controversies, such as [[same-sex marriage]]{{Example needed}}, [[pornography]]{{Example needed}}, [[marijuana legalization]]{{Example needed}}, [[alternative sexuality|alternative sexualities]]{{Example needed}} and, in some cases, legalization of early [[abortion]]{{Example needed}}. In all cases, it expresses the view that one's "[[Feeling#Stomach feeling|gut reaction]]" might justify objecting to some practice even in the absence of a persuasive rational case against that practice.

==Criticism==
The wisdom of repugnance has been criticized, both as an example of a [[Fallacy|fallacious]] [[appeal to emotion]] and for an underlying premise which seems to reject [[rationalism]]. Although mainstream science concedes that a sense of [[disgust]] most likely [[Evolution|evolved]] as a useful [[defence mechanisms|defense mechanism]] (e.g. in that it tends to prevent or prohibit potentially harmful behaviour such as [[inbreeding]], [[cannibalism]], and [[coprophagia]]), social psychologists question whether the instinct can serve any moral or logical value when removed from the context in which it was originally acquired.

[[Martha Nussbaum]] explicitly opposes the concept of a disgust-based [[morality]]. Nussbaum notes that disgust has been used throughout history as a justification for [[persecution]]. For example, at various times [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]] have all been driven by popular repulsion.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum 2004"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|url= http://chronicle.com/free/v50/i48/48b00601.htm |title=Danger to Human Dignity: The Revival of Disgust and Shame in the Law|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=2007-11-24|location=Washington, DC|authorlink= Martha Nussbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] has remarked that "our prejudices often overwhelm our limited information. &amp;#91;They&amp;#93; are so venerable, so reflexive, so much a part of our second nature, that we never stop to recognize their status as social decisions with radical alternatives&amp;mdash;and we view them instead as given and obvious truths."&lt;ref name="Gould 1997"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gould, Stephen Jay|year=1997|title=[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence From Plato to Darwin]]|publisher=Harmony|isbn=0-517-70849-3|authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British bioethicist [[John Harris (bioethicist)|John Harris]] replied to Kass's view by arguing that, "there is no necessary connection between phenomena, attitudes, or actions that make us uneasy, or even those that disgust us, and those phenomena, attitudes, and actions that there are good reasons for judging unethical. Nor does it follow that those things we are confident are unethical must be prohibited by legislation or regulation."&lt;ref name="Harris 1998"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Harris, John|title=Clones, Genes, and Immortality: Ethics and the Genetic Revolution|location=[[Oxford, England|Oxford]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1998|page=37|isbn=0-19-288080-2|authorlink=John Harris (bioethicist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This paragraph is of highly questionable relevance.--&gt;The word ''[[wiktionary:squick|squick]]'' was created within [[BDSM]] subculture in reaction to this sort of reasoning, and denotes a "gut reaction" of disgust without the implication of any sort of actual moral judgment.&lt;ref name="DTDSquick"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/squick/ |title=Squick|work=Double-Tongued Dictionary|date=June 23, 2005|accessdate=2007-11-24|author=Barrett, Grant (ed.)|location=[[Brooklyn, NY]]|publisher=Grant Barrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6239">[[Employee]]s typically must relinquish some of their '''privacy while at the workplace''', but how much they must do so can be a contentious issue. The debate rages on as to whether it is moral, ethical and legal for employers to [[employee monitoring|monitor the actions of their employees]]. [[Employer]]s believe that monitoring is necessary both to discourage illicit activity and to limit liability. Although, with this problem of monitoring employees, many are experiencing a negative effect on [[emotional stress|emotional]] and physical stress including [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], lowered [[employee morale]] and lack of [[motivation]] within the [[workplace]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. Employers might choose to monitor employee activities using [[surveillance cameras]], or may wish to record employees activities while using company owned computers or telephones. Courts are finding that disputes between workplace [[privacy]] and freedom are being complicated with the advancement of technology as traditional rules that govern areas of [[privacy law]] are debatable and becoming less important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/workplace-surveillance.htm Howstuffworks "How Workplace Surveillance Works"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/2001/10/18/sinrod.htm Electronic surveillance in the workplace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
The [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|EU Directive 95/46/EC]] on the protection of individuals with regards to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data limits and regulates the collection of personal information on individuals, including workers. Firms that monitor employees' use of e-mail, internet, or phones as part of their business practice with out notifying employees or obtaining employee consent can be, in most cases, sued under Article 8 the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Although EU law is clear that e-mail interception is illegal, the law is not totally clear as to whether companies may prohibit employees from sending private e-mails.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sylvia Kierkegaard|Sylvia Mercado Kierkegaard]] (2005) Reading Your Keystroke: Whose Mail Is It? [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]], Publisher: Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, Volume 3592 / 2005, Chapter: p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]] provides some privacy protections for employees.  ''See [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968#Employee Privacy|Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 § Employee Privacy]]''.   The [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] extends protections to include email messages, cell phones and other electronic communications.  ''See [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act#Employee Privacy|Electronic Communications Privacy Act § Employee Privacy]]''.

A 2005 survey of more than 500 U.S. companies found that over half of employers had disciplined employees and about one in four had terminated (fired) an employee for "inappropriate" use of the internet, such as sending an inappropriate email message to a client or supervisor, neglecting work while [[instant messaging|chatting]] with friends, or viewing pornography during work hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5697883 Surfing the Web on the Company Dime : NPR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tools that are used for [[electronic surveillance]] are often caching [[proxy server]]s that are also used for [[Computer and network surveillance|web monitoring]].

==Canada==
{{further|Canadian privacy law}}
In ''[[R v Cole]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makin|first1=Kirk|title=Supreme Court rules employees have right to privacy on work computers|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-employees-have-right-to-privacy-on-work-computers/article4625660/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that {{quote|Computers that are reasonably used for personal purposes — whether found in the workplace or the home — contain information that is meaningful, intimate, and touching on the user’s biographical core.  Canadians may therefore reasonably expect privacy in the information contained on these computers, at least where personal use is permitted or reasonably expected.|source={{lexum-scc|2012|53}}}}

== Economic theory ==
According to the [[Coase theorem|Coase Theorem]], an employer and an employee never agree to a contractual arrangement that would reduce the total surplus generated by the two parties together. Hence, when we observe workplace surveillance, then the costs (say, the worker’s disutility caused by the loss of privacy) must be smaller than the benefit (say, the additional profit due to a reduction of shirking), because otherwise the parties would abolish surveillance (the worker would be willing to accept a smaller wage in exchange for more privacy, which would increase the employer’s profit more than surveillance could do). However, the Coase Theorem holds only if there are no [[Transaction cost|transaction costs]]. Schmitz (2005) has shown that in the presence of asymmetric information (leading to a [[moral hazard]] problem), the total surplus generated by an employer and an employee can be increased if workplace surveillance is prohibited by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W.|date=2005|title=Workplace surveillance, privacy protection, and efficiency wages|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2004.06.001|journal=Labour Economics|volume=12|issue=6|pages=727–738|doi=10.1016/j.labeco.2004.06.001|issn=0927-5371|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
