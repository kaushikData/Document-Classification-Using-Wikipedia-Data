[[Image:Lotus 18 Stirling Moss Monaco 1961.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''[[Rob Walker Racing]]'' [[Lotus 18]] which [[Stirling Moss]] drove to victory in the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix.]]

The '''1961 Monaco Grand Prix''' was a [[Formula One]] motor race held on 14 May 1961 on the [[Circuit de Monaco]] in [[Monte Carlo]], [[Monaco]]. It was race 1 of 8 in both the [[1961 World Championship of Drivers]] and the [[1961 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers]]. It was also the first World Championship race under the new 1.5 litre engine regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr095.html |title=Grand Prix Results, Monaco GP, 1961 |publisher=grandprix.com |accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Report ==

=== Qualifying ===
The erratic yearly variations in Monaco's qualifying regulations saw grid places guaranteed for works teams and past winners in 1961.&lt;ref name="LangVol1P180"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lang |first=Mike |title=Grand Prix! Vol 1 |publisher=Haynes Publishing Group |year=1981 |isbn=0-85429-276-4 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the five works teams were awarded two places each on the grid, while [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]] earned spots. This left nine drivers to fight over four remaining slots. A fifth opened up when [[Innes Ireland]] crashed during the final practice session, breaking his leg. Moss took pole position from [[Richie Ginther]] and [[Jim Clark]], with [[Graham Hill]] and [[Phil Hill]] on the second row.

=== Race ===
Ginther led Clark and Moss into the first corner but Clark quickly ran into trouble with a faulty fuel pump. Ginther dropped to third on lap 14, when Moss and Bonnier passed him in quick succession.&lt;ref name="LangVol1P180"/&gt; At quarter distance, Moss had an impressive 10 second lead (in the underpowered [[Lotus 18]]-[[Coventry-Climax|Climax]])&lt;ref&gt;Kettlewell, Mike. "Monaco: Road Racing on the Riviera", in Northey, Tom, editor. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 12, p.1384.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Ferraris of Hill and then Ginther found their way around Bonnier and began to close the gap. At half distance, Moss' lead was 8 seconds, and down to 3 seconds on lap 60. Ginther moved into second on lap 75 and tried to close the gap, but Moss proved able to match his lap times, despite the [[Ferrari 156|156]]'s horsepower advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Kettlewell, p.1384.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Qaeda''' has conducted operations and recruited members in '''Africa'''. It has included a number of bombing attacks in [[North Africa]] and supporting parties in civil wars in [[Eritrea]] and [[Somalia]]. From 1991 to 1996, [[Osama bin Laden]] and other [[al-Qaeda]] leaders were based in [[Sudan]].

==Algeria==
{{Main article|Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb|Insurgency in the Maghreb (2002–present)}}
{{See also|December 11, 2007 Algiers bombings}}

An insurgency is being waged by the [[Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb|Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat]] (which is called today as the [[al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb]]) against the [[Government of Algerian|Algerian government]]. It is a spin-off to the [[Algerian Civil War]] that ended in 2002, and has been linked to bombings in [[2007 Algiers bombings (disambiguation)|Algiers]], [[2007 Batna bombing|Batna]] and [[2007 Dellys bombing|Dellys]] in 2007.

The group has declared its intention to attack Algerian, [[France|French]], American and Spanish targets. It has been designated as a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|Foreign Terrorist Organization]] by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], and similarly classed as a terrorist organization by the [[European Union]].

==Eritrea==
As soon as the allied Somali and Ethiopian forces drove the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) out of Somalia in January 2007, U.S. accused Eritrea of providing safe haven for some of their leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-04/2007-04-23-voa66.cfm?CFID=144318625&amp;CFTOKEN=43657409 U.S. accuses Eritrea on supporting islamists]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; America also condemned Eritrea since it continued to "fund, arm, train and advise the insurgents" attacking the Somalia government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/uspolicy/2007-04-26-voa3.cfm U.S. condemns Eritrean assistance of islamists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604072925/http://www.voanews.com/uspolicy/2007-04-26-voa3.cfm |date=2008-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,2052758,00.html US blames Eritrea over Somalian insurgency]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a regional Somali government, some Eritrean soldiers were also sighted working with Arab and al-Qaeda fighters against the Somalian government, and the foreign alliance attacked government positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Islamist_supporters_al-Qaeda_terrorists_attacked_us_Somalia_governor.shtml allied ICU, Al-Qaeda and Eritrean fighters attack government positions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615022638/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Islamist_supporters_al-Qaeda_terrorists_attacked_us_Somalia_governor.shtml |date=2007-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 there were reports that the Eritrean government is sheltering the leadership of the insurgency in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9597711 |title="The Economist" sites alliance of the islamists and Eritrea |access-date=2008-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612090054/http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9597711 |archive-date=2008-06-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations continued to report of Eritrean assistance to Somalis with alleged links to al-Qaeda.

==Kenya==
In 2002 another successful terrorist attack in [[Kenya]] after the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|U.S. embassy bombing]], a [[2002 Mombasa attacks|car bomb attack on a Mombasa resort hotel]] popular among Israeli tourists claimed the lives of 15 people. The hotel bombing occurred 20 minutes after a failed attack on an airplane, when a terrorist fired an [[Strela 2|SA-7]] [[Man-portable air-defense systems|man-portable air-defense system]] against an Israeli airliner carrying 261 passengers, which was taking off from the airport; the missile seemingly failed to track its target, nor did it detonate, and landed in an empty field.

==Libya==
On 3 November 2007, al-Zawahiri claimed in a 28-minute recording posted on an Islamic website that "...&amp;nbsp;members of the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]] announce that they are joining the al-Qaeda group ..."  According to [[Al Jazeera]], [[Abu al-Laith]] appeared to be the leader of the new Libyan wing. Fighting Islamic Group first announced its presence in 1995, vowing to overthrow [[Muammar Gaddafi]], the Libyan leader. In 2001, the group was added to a UN list of individuals and institutions "belonging to, or associated with, al-Qaeda".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/1BA708B9-39ED-4B51-BED9-9B5322E75A8E.htm Zawahri: Libya group joins al-Qaeda] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308161906/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/1BA708B9-39ED-4B51-BED9-9B5322E75A8E.htm |date=2008-03-08 }} accessed November 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The group, formerly known as the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, is well known to have had links to Maghreb faction of al-Qaeda.

On 1 November 2011, less than a month after the death of Muammar Gaddafi, the al-Qaeda flag was seen flying off the roof of a courthouse in Benghazi's city center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Al Qaeda flag flown above Benghazi courthouse|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8861608/Libya-Al-Qaeda-flag-flown-above-Benghazi-courthouse.html|work=Photos taken at: 7.00AM GMT 01 Nov 2011.|accessdate=15 November 2011|location=London|date=2011-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115051312/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8861608/Libya-Al-Qaeda-flag-flown-above-Benghazi-courthouse.html|archive-date=2011-11-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, al-Shabaab officially pledged loyalty to Al-Qaeda. In an audio message to Al-Qaeda leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], the al-Shabaab leader said: "On behalf of the soldiers and the commanders in al-Shabaab, we pledge allegiance to you. So lead us to the path of jihad and martyrdom that was drawn by our imam, the martyr Osama."&lt;ref name=Joining&gt;{{cite news|title=Al-Shabaab joining al Qaeda, monitor group says |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-09/africa/world_africa_somalia-shabaab-qaeda_1_al-zawahiri-qaeda-somali-americans?_s=PM:AFRICA |newspaper=CNN |date=9 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317152618/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-09/africa/world_africa_somalia-shabaab-qaeda_1_al-zawahiri-qaeda-somali-americans?_s=PM%3AAFRICA |archivedate=2012-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda was also linked to militant [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU) front in Somalia.

She listed the following persons as suspected of being in Somalia (name and nationality): [[Fazul Abdullah Mohamed]] (Comoros), [[Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan]] (Kenya), and [[Abu Taha al-Sudan]] (Sudan). When the ICU did not cooperate, the U.S. first financed the rival factions, and then followed with limited air strikes as the ICU rule in Mogadishu fell in the face of [[Ethiopian Army]] assault. The Pentagon said a high level al-Qaeda member from the ICU was captured in Somalia and transferred to the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6729015.stm |title=Pentagon captures high level Al-Qaeda member in Somalia |access-date=2008-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412111551/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6729015.stm |archive-date=2008-04-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knx1070.com/pages/551987.php?contentType=4&amp;contentId=584302 U.S. detains Al-Qaeda member] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063121/http://www.knx1070.com/pages/551987.php?contentType=4&amp;contentId=584302 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dissolution of the ICU, Al-Qaeda reportedly established strong ties with the [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] splinter group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8491329.stm |title=Somali Islamists al-Shabab 'join al-Qaeda fight' |access-date=2012-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213005742/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8491329.stm |archive-date=2010-02-13 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, it is thought that the [[Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan]] was killed during a military raid in Somalia. He was a top Al-Qaeda suspect and was thought to be responsible for attacks on a hotel in Kenya and on an [[Israel]]i airliner in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8254957.stm BBC news – Al-Qaeda Somalia suspect 'killed']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1251804570732&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull JPost – Kenya terrorist killed in Somalia raid]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sudan==
In 1991, [[Sudan]]'s [[National Islamic Front]], an Islamist group that had recently gained power, invited al-Qaeda to move operations to Sudan.&lt;ref name=TESTIMONY-OF-JT-CARUSO&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, al-Qaeda operated several businesses (including import/export, farm, and construction firms) in what might be considered a period of financial consolidation. The group built a major 1200-km (845-mi) highway connecting the capital [[Khartoum]] with [[Port Sudan]].&lt;ref name=INSIDE-AL-QAEDA&gt;{{cite web

In 1996, Osama bin Laden was asked to leave Sudan after the United States put the regime under extreme pressure to expel him, citing possible connections to the 1994 attempted assassination of [[Egypt]]ian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] while his motorcade was in [[Addis Ababa, Ethiopia]]. Controversy exists regarding whether Sudan offered to turn bin Laden over to the U.S. prior to the expulsion. There is an audio tape ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070808205904/http://www.newsmax.com/audio/BILLVH.mp3 Audio]) ([http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/9/10/181819.shtml?s=ic Transcript]) recording of former President Bill Clinton talking about the offer from the Sudanese government. There are conflicting reports on whether the Sudanese government indeed made such an offer, but they were in fact prepared to turn him over to Saudi Arabia, who declined to take him.&lt;ref&gt;"Newsmax" http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/9/10/181819.shtml?s=ic {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820193956/http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/9/10/181819.shtml?s=ic |date=2007-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osama bin Laden finally left Sudan in a well-executed operation, arriving at [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan]] by air in late 1996 with over 200 of his supporters and their families.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">'''Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center''' ('''ZAB''') is located at 8000 Louisiana Boulevard, [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], [[United States]]. The Albuquerque [[ARTCC]] is one of 22 Air Route Traffic Control Centers in the United States.

The primary responsibility is the separation of overflights, and the expedited sequencing of arrivals and departures along STARs ([[Standard Terminal Arrival Route]]s) and SIDs ([[Standard Instrument Departure]]s) for the airspace over most of Arizona and New Mexico, as well as parts of California, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas.

ZAB covers an area that includes one ''[[Class B Airports|class Bravo]]'' airport.
* [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]] (PHX) in [[Phoenix, AZ]]

ZAB also includes four ''[[Class C airport|class Charlie]]'' airports.
* [[Albuquerque International Sunport]] (ABQ) in [[Albuquerque, NM]]
* [[El Paso International Airport]] (ELP) in [[El Paso, TX]]
* [[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport]] (AMA) in [[Amarillo, TX]]
* [[Tucson International Airport]] (TUS) in [[Tucson, AZ]]

== Subdivision ==
ZAB's airspace is divided both geographically and altitudinally.

ZAB's primary subdivisions are known as specialties. There are five different specialties known as the North, East, Southeast, Southwest and Northwest.  Each specialty is broken down further into 7 or 8 sectors.

By altitude, ZAB comprises 7 ultra-high sectors, 16 high-altitude sectors, 13 low-altitude sectors, and 3 low-high sectors.  The vertical strata of these sectors vary greatly depending on the geographic location covered and the variety of traffic the controllers work.

'''[[Andorra]]''' has participated in the '''Eurovision Song Contest''' six times, debuting in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 contest]]. Interest in the contest had been great for a long time, despite the local Andorran broadcaster, [[Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra|Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra (RTVA)]], not showing the contest until recent years (citizens could watch it on [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[France|French]] stations). A majority of the songs have so far been sung in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], the [[national language]] of Andorra.

As of 2019, Andorra is the only country to have participated in the contest and never to have featured in the final.

==Participation==
Despite the homeland interest in the competition, Andorra has never qualified for the final. In 2007, a qualification for the final was predicted, but with a 12th-place finish, it just missed out. In the past RTVA held a large [[reality show]] contest to select its entry for Eurovision. From [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], RTVA held an internal selection process to select the Andorran entry for the Eurovision Song Contest.
 
RTVA confirmed its participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 contest]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. It announced that there would be a public selection process - something not seen in the country since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12271/andorra_will_participate_at_eurovision_2009|title=Andorra will participate at Eurovision 2009|last=Hondal|first=Víctor|date=11 September 2008|publisher=ESCToday|website=esctoday.com|accessdate=11 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/12415/andorra_prepares_for_eurovision_2009|title=Andorra prepares for Eurovision 2009!|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|date=22 October 2008|publisher=ESCToday|website=esctoday.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andorra's 2009 entry once again failed to qualify, getting only 8 points in the semifinal.

In the finals, Andorra has always given its 12 points to Spain, with the exception of 2007. As the two nations are neighbouring, this has done very little to dispel accusations of political voting which have been going on for a long time. In December 2009, RTVA announced that Andorra would withdraw from the 2010 Contest due to a lack of funding for an Andorran entry. This came after RTVA submitted an entry for the contest, in case funding could be found to submit an entry. However no funding could be found, and so Andorra was forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/14492/upd-_andorra_submit_application_to_ebu|title=Andorra submit application to EBU|last=Hondal|first=Victor|date=13 November 2009|publisher=ESCToday|website=esctoday.com|accessdate=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/14611/definitely_no_andorra_in_oslo|title=Definitely, no Andorra in Oslo|last=Victor|first=Hondal|date=12 December 2009|publisher=ESCToday|website=esctoday.com|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra did not participate in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011 contest]] due to financial difficulties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|url=http://esctoday.com/16164/confirmed_andorra_will_not_return_in_2011|title=Confirmed: Andorra will not return in 2011|publisher=ESCToday|website=esctoday.com|accessdate=6 October 2010|date=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the 2012 contest, for the same reason. Andorra did not participate in subsequent contests.

== EBU withdrawal ==
On 8 November 2011, it was announced by the Andorran broadcaster, RTVA, that they would leave the EBU, due to financial reasons and a cut of subsidies from the Andorran government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escdaily.com/andorra-rtva-to-quit-the-european-broadcasting-union/|title=Andorra: RTVA to quit the European Broadcasting Union|last=Van Ee|first=Dennis|website=escdaily.com|publisher=ESCDaily|accessdate=10 November 2011|date=10 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616040548/http://www.escdaily.com/andorra-rtva-to-quit-the-european-broadcasting-union/|archive-date=2013-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a meeting with the EBU director Ingrid Deltenre in June 2012, RTVA decided to stay in the EBU, but said participation in Eurovision is still unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hondal|first=Victor|url=http://esctoday.com/36855/andorra-to-stay-in-ebu-no-eurovision-return-expected|title=Andorra to stay in EBU, no Eurovision return planned|website=esctoday.com|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=20 June 2012|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Notes
&lt;!-- The reason this note is added, is because IP's have vandalised this article in the past by placing Andorra as joint 24th with Serbia &amp; Montenegro.  The note is to explain that Andorra was in fact in 23rd, with the citation showing that Serbia-Mont. are listed as 24th, despite the latter not even participating. --&gt;
:1. {{note|a}} Andorra finished in 23rd place at the {{Escyr|2006}} contest, even though 24 countries appear on the semi-final scoreboard published by the European Broadcasting Union. Serbia &amp; Montenegro withdrew from the competition before the contest but still voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yannoulatou|first=Fotini|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2006 Semi-Final|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=333|work=European Broadcasting Union|publisher=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=26 May 2014|date=18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bac u kry''' is a [[Slogan]] which was used during [[Kosovo|Kosovo's]]{{ref label|status|a|}} independence from [[Serbia]] in February 2008. It means ''Uncle, It is done!''&lt;ref name="unclueitsdone"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joy and defiance on Kosovo's greatest day|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/17/serbia.kosovo|publisher=The Guardian|date=February 17, 2008|accessdate=March 9, 2010 | location=London | first=Peter | last=Beaumont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan was also used on T-shirts, pens and posters. The creators of this phrase say that this symbolizes the independence which many [[Ethnic Albanian]]s dreamt for since the end of the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="unclueitsdone"/&gt;

The slogan often accompanies the face of [[Adem Jashari]], an Ethnic Albanian [[Commander]] during the [[Kosovo War]] who was killed in action.&lt;ref name="unclueitsdone"/&gt;

==Uses==
The slogan '''Bac u kry''' was used by many. There are [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]]s which use this phrase. In addition, in downtown Borroramizi ([[Pallati i Rinisë]]) there is a flag with exactly the same expression.

'''Bernard Lugan''' is a contemporary French [[historian]] and [[Associate Professor]] of [[African history]] at [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3]], in [[France]]. He's also teaching at the [[French Institute of Defense Studies]]. He has an [[Academic rank in France|academic rank]] as "Maître de conférences". A specialist of [[Africa]] since 1971, he authored many books on the African continent. He is the editor of "L'Afrique réelle".

He studied at the [[Paris X University Nanterre]] and edited a [[thesis]] (third cycle doctorate) naming "L'Économie d'échange au Rwanda de 1850 à 1914". He also has lived for an extended time in [[Africa]], especially in [[Rwanda]] where he has conducted significant research, and has taught African History at the [[National University of Rwanda]]. In 1982, he authored a thesis for a state doctorate naming "Entre les servitudes de la houe et les sortilèges de la vache : le monde rural dans l'ancien Rwanda".

Lugan's notable work includes several books on [[Southern Africa]], [[Morocco]] and [[Rwanda]] including "History of South Africa", ''When Africa was German'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frenchpubagency.com/Title-199212-History/Cette-Afrique-qui-etait-Allemande-.html When Africa was German - notes by Bureau International de l'Edition Française] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711040115/http://www.frenchpubagency.com/Title-199212-History/Cette-Afrique-qui-etait-Allemande-.html |date=July 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''African Legacy, Solutions for a Community in Crisis'' where he describes how ''[[individualism]] hasn't replaced preexisting loyalties to [[clan]]s, groups, and [[tribe]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intellectualconservative.com/article4009.html Book Review by Steven D. Laib, J.D., M.S.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020082718/http://www.intellectualconservative.com/article4009.html |date=October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, he rejects what he calls "the victimization [[paradigm]]," which says [[Colonialism|colonial]] exploitation and the [[slave]] [[trade]] brought Africa to its knees, rejects solutions based on Western guilt and claim that a correct interpretation of history is necessary for Africans to "build a future on a more solid foundation" and save an African continent ravaged by [[famine]], economic disaster and [[civil war]]. He notably proposes a redrawing of national African [[frontier]]s in accordance with [[ethnic]] groupings and promotes a new type of [[democracy]], more rooted in those native groupings rather than on Western "[[one man one vote]]" system.

Bernard Lugan is also an expert witness for the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]].

The '''Commonwealth Secretariat''' is the main intergovernmental agency and central institution of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  It is responsible for facilitating co-operation between members; organising meetings, including the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]]s (CHOGM); assisting and advising on policy development; and providing assistance to countries in implementing the decisions and policies of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/subhomepage/151087/ |title=Commonwealth Secretariat |accessdate=27 July 2007 |publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819010932/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/subhomepage/151087/ |archivedate=19 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretariat has [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer]] status in the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. It is located at [[Marlborough House]] in London, the United Kingdom, a former royal residence that was given by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Head of the Commonwealth]].

==History==
[[File:Marlborough House.jpg|thumb|[[Marlborough House]], London, the headquarters of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Commonwealth's principal intergovernmental institution]]
The Secretariat was established by Heads of Government in 1965, taking over many of the functions of the United Kingdom Government's [[Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations|Commonwealth Relations Office]], as part of a major shake-up of the organisation of the Commonwealth.  At the same time, the United Kingdom succeeded in advocating the creation of the Secretariat's sister organisation, the [[Commonwealth Foundation]] was founded to foster non-governmental relations and the promotion of the [[Commonwealth Family]] network of civil societies.&lt;ref name="Canada and the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/40203725 |last=McIntyre |first=W. David |authorlink=W. David McIntyre |date=October 1998 |title=Canada and the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat |jstor=40203725 |journal=International Journal |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=753–777  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attempts by members to create similar central bodies, such as a medical conference (proposed by [[New Zealand]]), a development bank ([[Jamaica]]), and an institution for satellite communications (Canada) failed.&lt;ref name="Canada and the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat" /&gt;

The creation of the Secretariat itself was a contentious issue.  The United Kingdom and other long-established countries had hoped to slow the tide of expansion of Commonwealth membership to prevent the dilution of their traditional power within the Commonwealth (particularly after the admission of [[Cyprus]]).&lt;ref name="Canada and the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat" /&gt; This may have involved a dual-tiered Commonwealth, requiring the continuation of the organisation of Commonwealth co-operation by meetings, rather than a central administration.  However, the new African members were keener to create an independent inter-governmental 'central clearing house' (as [[Ghana]]'s [[Kwame Nkrumah]] described it) to remove power from the older dominions.&lt;ref name="Canada and the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat" /&gt; [[Milton Obote]] of [[Uganda]] was the first to propose a specifically titled 'secretariat', which was then formally proposed by [[Eric Williams]] of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], who wished to see it based upon the secretariats of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[European Economic Community|EEC]], and [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]].&lt;ref name="Canada and the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat" /&gt;

Earlier attempts at the formation of a central secretariat had been made and failed.  Australia had proposed the establishment four times (in 1907, 1924, 1932, and 1944), whilst [[New Zealand]] had also made proposals in 1909 and 1956.&lt;ref name="Canada and the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat" /&gt;

==Staff==
The chief executive of the Secretariat, and of the Commonwealth as a whole, is the [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Profile: The Commonwealth |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1554175.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date= |accessdate=16 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All Secretariat staff report to the secretary-general, who is also responsible for spending the Secretariat's budget, which is granted by the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]]. It is the secretary-general, and not the ceremonial [[Head of the Commonwealth]], that represents the Commonwealth publicly. The secretary-general is elected by the Heads of Government at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting]]s for terms of four years; previously, until 2000, a term was five years. The current Secretary-General is Dominica's [[Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal|Patricia Scotland]], who replaced [[Kamalesh Sharma]] as Secretary-General on 1 April 2016.&lt;ref name="Kamalesh Sharma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/media/news/together-we-are-so-much-stronger-says-scotland-her-first-day-new-secretary-general|title=‘Together we are so much stronger’ says Scotland as she becomes new Secretary-General|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secretary-general is assisted by three [[Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General|deputy secretaries-general]]: one responsible for economic affairs (currently Deodat Maharaj), one for political affairs (Josephine Ojiambo), and one for corporate affairs (Gary Dunn). The secretary-general may appoint junior staff at his own discretion, provided the Secretariat can afford it, whilst the more senior staff may be appointed only from a shortlist of nominations from the Heads of Government.&lt;ref name="Doxey"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doxey |first=Margaret |date=January 1979 |title=The Commonwealth Secretary-General: Limits of Leadership |journal=[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]] |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=67–83 |doi=10.2307/2617133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the secretary-general has more power than this; member governments consult the secretary-general on nominations, and the secretary-general has also at times submitted nominations of his own.&lt;ref name="Doxey" /&gt;

All members of staff are exempt from [[Income tax in the United Kingdom|income tax]], under the [[International Organisations Act 2005]], which redefined the legal status of the Secretariat.

==Headquarters==
The Secretariat is headquartered at [[Marlborough House]], in London, the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="History of Marlborough House"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/34467/151305/marlborough_house_history/ |title=The History of Marlborough House |accessdate=16 June 2008 |publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624014156/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/34467/151305/marlborough_house_history/ |archivedate=24 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marlborough House is located on [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], next to [[St. James's Palace]], which is formally the location of the British [[Court of St. James's|Royal Court]]. Marlborough House was previously a royal residence in its own right, but was given by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], the [[Head of the Commonwealth]], to the British government in September 1959 for use for Commonwealth purposes. This was first realised three years later. Another three years later, in 1965, the building passed to the Secretariat upon its foundation.&lt;ref name="History of Marlborough House" /&gt; The building itself was designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]] and served as the London residence of the [[dukes of Marlborough]] until it was given to [[Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales|Princess Charlotte]] in 1817.&lt;ref name="History of Marlborough House" /&gt;

The [[Commonwealth Secretariat Act 1966]], which applied retroactively from the establishment of the Secretariat in 1965, first granted the organisation full [[diplomatic immunity]]. This has been subjected to a number of lawsuits challenging this, including ''Mohsin v Commonwealth Secretariat'', and in 2005, ''[[Sumukan Limited v Commonwealth Secretariat]]''. The 1966 Act had been interpreted by [[England and Wales|English]] courts as allowing the courts to exercise supervisory jurisdiction under the [[Arbitration Act 1996]] over the Commonwealth's arbitration tribunal, which had been envisaged as the sole organ to arbitrate on matters related to the Secretariat's operations in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="International Organisations Bill"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmbills/069/en/05069x--.htm |title=International Organisations Bill |accessdate=16 June 2008 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this interpretation, the Commonwealth Secretariat Act was amended by the [[International Organisations Act 2005]], which gave the Commonwealth Secretariat Arbitral Tribunal the same legal immunity as the Secretariat itself, guaranteeing independence of the English courts.&lt;ref name="International Organisations Bill" /&gt;

A '''dijkgraaf''' (translated: ''dike-warden'' or ''dike-reeve''), sometimes called a '''watergraaf''', is the [[chair (official)|chair]] of a [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water board]]. He is the equivalent of a [[mayor]] in local government and a [[King's Commissioner]] in provincial government, chairing both the legislative and executive council, while having both ceremonial and representational roles as well as his own portfolios. The term goes back to pre-medieval days.

Literally the term means "[[Dike (construction)|Dike]] [[count]]", like other titles ending in ''-graaf'' (equivalent to English -grave and German ''-[[graf]]'') of feudal origin, but remained a functional official. The government bodies in the Netherlands today in order of rank are:
#National
#Provincial
#Municipal
#Water boards.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In medieval times and earlier however, the water boards were the same as municipal, and since it was a country of duchies, the Water board (''Waterschap'') was in governmental terms the equivalent of a city (''Stad''), and thus also the highest form of government.

'''Forte Duque de Bragança''' is a ruined fort located on the islet [[Ilhéu de Sal Rei]] off the northwestern coast of the island of [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]], [[Cape Verde]]. The fort was named after the [[Duke of Bragança]]. The fort overlooks a stretch of coast where the anchorage required defending from piracy and coastal raiding, which were common in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at the time. The island produced salt, which attracted international trade and wealth. It was sacked in 1815 and 1817; this led to the construction of a fort in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caboverde-info.com/Identidade/Cultura/Patrimonio-Arquitetonico Património Arquitetónico]&lt;/ref&gt; Today in ruins, the fort has been partly excavated archaeologically by the [[University of Cambridge]].

The '''International Institute for Asian Studies''' ('''IIAS''') is a global research institute and knowledge exchange platform, based in Leiden, the Netherlands. The Institute initiates and promotes interdisciplinary and trans-sectoral programmes that engage partners in Asia as well as institutes elsewhere in the world. So doing, the Institute aims to promote a more integrated understanding of present-day Asian realities as well as to pioneer new approaches to Asian Studies in a changing global context, and, more specifically, to contribute to new humanistically-informed and policy-relevant knowledge about Asia.   

==Establishment==
The International Institute for Asian Studies was established in 1993, following recommendations by two successive committees, installed by the Dutch Ministry of Education and Science (1989) and the Royal Netherlands Institute for Arts and Sciences (KNAW).&lt;ref&gt;Advisory Committee on the ‘Small Arts’ departments (Dutch: ''Kleine Letteren'') chaired by J.F. Staal, set up in July 1989 by the Minister of Education and Science. Report: 'Krishna in the Delta' (October 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Leiden was only a logical choice for the Institute’s headquarters. Leiden is home to many institutes with expertise and resources about Asia, including Leiden University, the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (KITLV), the Siebold House Japanmuseum, the Netherlands Institute for the Near East (NINO), the National Museum of Ethnology and the National Museum of Antiquities. 

The International Institute for Asian Studies was, and still is, hosted by Leiden University, which provides office space as well as administrative and IT services. From 1997 to 2012, IIAS also had a branch office in Amsterdam, facilitated by the University of Amsterdam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iias.asia/iiasn/13/Institutes/13eaxb08.html|title=The IIAS Branch Office in Amsterdam, IIAS Newsletter 13, Summer 1997.|last=Rutten|first=Mario|date=|website=iias.asia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

IIAS receives its core funding from the Ministry of Education. The Institute additionally generates income from external sources, via grants, subsidies, and the joint execution of programmes. 

While upholding its original mission, the Institute has over the years adapted and expanded its programmatic agenda in response to the demands of a changing global context.

==Activities==
Activities include multi-year research programmes and the building of academic networks, the organisation of international conferences and roundtables, a fellowship and a publication programme, PhD in-situ masterclasses, and the publication of a free periodical on Asian Studies (titled, ''[https://iias.asia/the-newsletter/ The Newsletter]''). 

The following current programmes and networks are among the Institute's main initiatives:

'''Khmuic peoples''' refers to a group of [[ethnic groups]] of [[Southeast Asia]].

==Geographic distribution==
The Khmuic peoples are aboriginal to Laos and surrounding areas.  Most Khmuic peoples live in northern [[Laos]] and neighboring areas in [[Vietnam]], although they can also be found in [[Thailand]], [[Burma]] and [[China]].

==Individual Khmuic speaking groups==
The individual Khmuic ethnic groups are as follows:
*[[Khmu people|Khmu]]
*[[Khmu people|Khmu U]]
*[[Khmu people|Khmu Rok]]
*[[Khmu people|Khmu Kwean]]
*[[Khmu people|Khmu Cheuang]]
*[[Khmu people|Khmu Leu]]
*[[Khmu people|Khmu Yuan]]
*[[Khmu people|Khmu Khrong]]
*[[Khmu people|Khmu Kasak]]
*[[Khmu people|Khmu Mea]]
Other two groups: [[Khmu Chuang people|Khmu Chuang]] and [[Khmu Kaye people|Khmu Kaye]] are extinct or were assimilated in other ethnic groups especially Khmu Chuang was believed to be extinct, absorbed or assimilated by or into Khmer. In the ancient time, the Khmu Chuang lived in the southern part of Khmuic territory which is the area of the present day southern Laos). The Khmu Kaye lived in the eastern part of Khmuic territory which is the area of the present day Xiengkhuang province. Be in mind that some scholars confuse Khmu Cheuang [cɯaŋ] and Khmu Chuang [cuaŋ]. These two groups are not the same, Khmu Cheuang are still exist in the present day and mostly live in northwestern of Vietnam.

==Non-Khmu peoples==
The following are individual ethnic groups which some scholars misunderstand that they are Khmu and speak Khmuic. In fact they are much different from Khmu, in both language and culture. There are only a few words (less than 10%) of their vocabularies that resemble Khmuic.
*[[Lua people|Lua]]
*[[Mal people|Mal]] (also known as the ''Tin'' in Thailand and the ''Thin'' in Laos)
*[[Mlabri people|Mlabri]] (also known as the ''Yumbri'')
*[[O Du people|O Du]]
*[[Phai people|Phai]]
*[[Pray people|Pray]]
*[[Xinh Mul people|Xinh Mul]]
*[[Phong people|Phong]]
*[[Phong-Kniang people|Phong-Kniang]]
*[[Khang people|Khang]]
There are also the [[Khao people|Khao]] and [[Bit people|Bit]] peoples which were once thought to be Khmuic, although recent linguistic studies suggest they are probably [[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]].

==Origin==
{{see also|Peopling of Laos}}
The Khmuic peoples are believed to have migrated by land from China to Laos, where they have resided for at least 4,000 years.  Some 10,000 years ago, they were probably part of a largely homogenous ethnicity, now referred to as the [[Austro-Asiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic peoples]], with a homeland somewhere within the borders of the modern-day [[People's Republic of China]].  The prevalence of [[Haplogroup O (Y-DNA)|Y-DNA Haplogroup O]] among Austro-Asiatic peoples suggests a common ancestry with the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]], and [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] peoples some 35,000 years ago in China.  Haplogroup O is a [[subclade]] of [[Haplogroup K (Y-DNA)|Y-DNA Haplogroup K]], which is believed to have originated approximately 40,000 years ago somewhere between Iran and Central China.  In addition to the ethnicities previously mentioned, the progenitor of Haplogroup K was the patrilineal ancestor of nearly all modern [[Melanesians]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].  Haplogroup K, in turn, is a subclade of [[Haplogroup F (Y-DNA)|Y-DNA Haplogroup F]], which is believed to have originated in Northern Africa some 45,000 years ago.  In addition to the ethnicities previously mentioned, the progenitor of Haplogroup F was probably the ancestor of all [[Indo-European languages|Indo-Europeans]].

==Language==
Their languages belong to the [[Khmuic languages|Khmuic]] language family, which is a branch of the [[Austro-Asiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]] language family.  Most scholars agree that the Khmuic languages are part of the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] branch of the Austro-Asiatic family, but the validity of the Mon–Khmer branch has recently been called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sidwell|first=Paul|title=Classifying the Austroasiatic languages: history and state of the art|year=2009|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich|authorlink=Paul Sidwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==
The Khmuic are generally an agricultural people, although gathering, hunting, trapping and fishing are also parts of the Khmuic lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Khmu Profile"&gt;[http://www.infomekong.com/khmu.htm Khmu Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mehmetçik''''' (literally: ''Little [[Mehmed|Mehmet]]'') is a general term used affectionately to refer soldiers of the [[Ottoman Army]] and [[Turkish Army]]. It is similar to the colloquialisms ''[[Tommy Atkins]]'', ''[[Doughboy]]'', and ''[[Digger (soldier)|Digger]]'' used for the [[British Army|British]], [[United States Army|U.S.]], and [[Australian Army|Austrialian armies]].&lt;ref&gt;David Nicole, (Illustrated by Christa Hook), ''Ottoman Infantryman 1914–18'', Osprey Publishing, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-84603-506-7}}, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phil Taylor, Pam Cupper, ''Gallipoli, A Battlefield Guide'', Kangaroo Press, 1989, {{page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is used for especially [[infantryman]] (foot soldier),&lt;ref&gt;Şehnaz Tahir Gürçağlar, ''The politics and poetics of translation in Turkey, 1923–1960'', Rodopi, 2008, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; terms such like [[Piyade]] Mehmetçik (Infantryman Little Mehmet) and Süvari Mehmetçik ([[Cavalryman]] Little Mehmet), Topçu Mehmetçik ([[Artilleryman]] Little Mehmet) have occasionally been seen.&lt;ref&gt;For example in Arif Bilge, ''Anadolunun Türkleşmesi, İslâmlaşması ve aramızdaki Rumlar Tarihi'', Ülkü Basımevi, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered that "Mehmetçik" was coined after Ottoman Army Sergeant [[Bigalı Mehmet Çavuş]] (1878–1964), who fought during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="co"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dn"/&gt;

{{Politics of Liechtenstein}}

The '''Prince Regnant of Liechtenstein''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Fürst von Liechtenstein'') is the monarch and [[head of state]] of [[Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref name="PLF"&gt;Principality of Liechtenstein Family - Die fürstliche Familie (in German) {{cite web |url=http://www.fuerstenhaus.li/de/fuerstenhaus/fuerstliche_familie/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103205759/http://www.fuerstenhaus.li/de/fuerstenhaus/fuerstliche_familie/ |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[princely family of Liechtenstein]], after which the sovereign principality was named in 1719, hails from [[Liechtenstein Castle]] in [[Lower Austria]], which the family possessed from at least 1140 to the thirteenth century, and from 1807 onward. It is the only remaining European monarchy that practises strict [[agnatic primogeniture]], meaning only first-born males may inherit the throne.

==History==
Through the centuries, the dynasty acquired vast swathes of land, predominantly in [[Moravia]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Silesia]], and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], though in all cases, these territories were held in [[fief]] under other more senior feudal lords, particularly under various lines of the [[Habsburg]] family, to whom several Liechtenstein princes served as close advisors.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} 

Without any territory held [[Imperial immediacy|immediately]] from the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial crown]], the Liechtenstein family, although [[German nobility|noble]], did not qualify for a seat in the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|''Diet'']] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. By purchase in 1699 and 1712 from the Counts of [[Waldburg-Zeil|Waldburg-Zeil-Hohenem]] of, respectively, the small ''Herrschaft'' (lordship) of [[Schellenberg]] and the countship of [[Vaduz]], the Liechtensteins acquired immediate lands within the Holy Roman Empire which made them eligible for elevation to the Imperial Diet. Thereby, on 23 January 1719 [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]] decreed Vaduz and Schellenberg were henceforth united and raised to the status of a ''[[Fürst]]entum'' (principality) under the name "Liechtenstein" for "[his] true servant, [[Anton Florian of Liechtenstein|Anton Florian von Liechtenstein]]". 

Although the family continued to own larger territories in various parts of central and eastern Europe, it was in right of Liechtenstein's status as an [[Imperial estate]] that the family of wealthy noble Austrian courtiers became a dynasty of [[imperial prince]]s, continuing to dwell in the imperial capital of [[Vienna]] or on their larger estates elsewhere, not taking up permanent residence in their principality for more than 300 years, moving into their [[Alps|Alpine]] realm only in 1938, after [[abolished monarchy|dissolution]] of both the Holy Roman Empire and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

==Powers==
The Prince of Liechtenstein has broad powers, which include the appointment of judges, the dismissal of ministers or government, [[veto power]], and the calling of [[referendum]]s. The [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003]] was a proposal put forth by reigning Prince Hans-Adam II to revise parts of the [[Constitution of Liechtenstein]], on the one hand expanding the monarch's power with the authority to veto legislation, while on the other hand securing for the citizenry the option to abolish the monarchy by vote at any time without being subject to princely veto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2853991.stm Liechtenstein prince wins powers] BBC News Online, 16 March 2003. Retrieved 29 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The right of the parishes that make up the principality to [[secession|secede]] was simultaneously recognised.

Prince Hans-Adam had warned that he and his family would move to Austria if the referendum were rejected. Despite opposition from [[Mario Frick (politician)|Mario Frick]], a former Liechtenstein prime minister, the Prince's referendum was approved by the electorate in 2003.

'''Paris-Mondial''' (later known as '''Voice of France''') was a [[France|French]]-government-owned [[shortwave]] [[external service]] radio station that began broadcasting in 1937. After the [[fall of France]], it continued broadcasting a domestic-only program.

==Origins==
Paris-Mondial first broadcast in 1937, targeting an international audience with multilingual programming. Its sign-on for its U.S.-directed broadcasts was "Hello, America!". A 1938 survey of French embassies reported that Paris-Mondial enjoyed a clear signal in [[North America]], though reception in [[Africa]] and the [[Caribbean]] was spotty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scales|first1=Rebecca|title=Radio and the Politics of Sound in Interwar France, 1921–1939|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1107108675|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wxl-CwAAQBAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
[[File:Tony Aubin 1930.jpg|thumb|Tony Aubin, artistic director of Paris-Mondial]]
Following the [[Battle of France|invasion of France]] in 1940, Paris-Mondial eliminated all non-English programming and began a non-stop schedule of broadcasts that included, ultimately fruitless, appeals for help by Frenchmen who had lived or worked in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="war"/&gt;

On June 9, 1940, the staff of Paris-Mondial abandoned their facilities in [[Paris]] and evacuated to a series of backup facilities, first in [[Poitiers]] and, after that became untenable, to [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name="war"/&gt;&lt;ref name="keane"/&gt; As of June 12, the monitoring centers of the U.S. networks [[NBC]] and [[CBS]] reported the station was continuing to transmit its "usual newscasts" and could still be picked-up in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Today's Radio Programs|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/12521245/|accessdate=February 28, 2017|work=The Daily Mail|page=9|date=June 12, 1940}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this routine soon gave way to "recordings of military marches and panicked appeals for guns, tanks, and planes".&lt;ref name="keane"/&gt; On June 14 the station went off-air, returning on June 15 with the sign-on "this is Paris-Mondial, broadcasting from somewhere in France". Programming became increasingly intermittent during the final days of the [[French Third Republic]].&lt;ref name="keane"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keane, Damien.|title=Ireland and the Problem of Information: Irish Writing, Radio, Late Modernist Communication.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-L0tCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT120|year=2014|publisher=Penn State University Press|location=Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-271-06756-8|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its last hours, the station's broadcasts consisted almost exclusively of frantic [[Talk radio|talk]]-format programs "begging for aid".&lt;ref name="war"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graves|first1=Harold|title=War On The Short Wave|date=1941|publisher=Foreign Policy Association|page=20|url=https://archive.org/stream/WarOnTheShortWave#page/n21/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of France, Paris-Mondial was rebranded by the government of the [[Vichy France|État Français]] as "the Voice of France" and aired a mixture of original programming and rebroadcasts of German radio, all internally directed (under the terms of the French surrender, international broadcasting was prohibited). When broadcasting German programming, Voice of France operated under the name "Y".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Jerome|title=On the Short Waves, 1923–1945: Broadcast Listening in the Pioneer Days of Radio|date=1999|publisher=McFarland|isbn=078643029X|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIxdEZS5ShsC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1937 to 1944, the artistic director of Paris-Mondial / Voice of France was [[Tony Aubin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Randel|first1=Don|title=The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music|date=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674372999|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEGpMqRcQjIC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Politeama Rossetti''' is an Italian theatre situated in the city of [[Trieste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connessomagazine.it/nek-e-il-suo-european-tour-2011-ad-aprile-al-politeama-rossetti-di-trieste|title=Nek e il suo European Tour 2011 ad aprile a al Politeama Rossetti di Trieste|date=2011-02-02|publisher=Connesso Magazine|language=Italian|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With over 60 shows scheduled each season, running from October to June, its stage shows include plays, musicals, ballet, dance and rock concerts.

It is the home of Teatro Stabile del Friuli Venezia Giulia, one of Italy's major public theatres. The artistic director is Antonio Calenda.

The theatre was built in 1878 and designed by Nicolò Bruno. It was heavily restored in 1928, 1969 and 1999. While the original capacity was over 5,000, it can now sit 1,531.

In the recent years the theatre has specialised in the presentation of major West End and Broadway musicals, including the original productions of ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' in 2008, ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bello Rocky Horror come appena scritto|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2009/04/06/bello-rocky-horror-come-appena-scritto.html|accessdate=25 July 2011|newspaper=La Repubblica|date=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' in 2009. In 2010 the theatre staged ''[[We Will Rock You]]'', featuring the music of Queen, the acclaimed 50th anniversary production of ''[[West Side Story]]'' and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]''. In 2011 the theatre hosted the Italian premieres of the musicals ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'' and ''[[Spamalot]]''.

'''Saorsat''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛər|s|æ|t}} {{respell|SAIR|sat}}; the [[Irish Language|Irish]] word '''Saor''', meaning free, therefore implying '''Freesat''' in [[English Language|English]]) is a [[free-to-air]] satellite service in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The service launched on 3 May 2012.&lt;ref name="Launch"/&gt;

==Overview==
The [[RTÉ Network Limited]] (RTÉNL) [[Analog television|analogue terrestrial television]] (ATT) network was never capable of providing 100% population coverage in Ireland. Prior to the digital switchover, ATT population coverage amounted to 98% for [[RTÉ One]] and [[RTÉ Two]], 95% for [[TG4]] and 85% for [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]]. [[Saorview]] [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] faces a similar difficulty.

Broadcasting the channels unencrypted from the [[Astra 28.2°E|Astra 2]] satellites at 28° East was not considered an option due to its large footprint covering the UK, France and many other countries. Irish broadcasters acquire rights on the basis that programming is  broadcast to Irish audiences (i.e. some 4.5 million people) and not to approx 100 million people within the Astra footprint. The Board of [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] approved the Saorsat approach developed by RTÉNL from early 2010 to enable the 1-2% of Irish households not covered by Saorview to access free-to-air digital television services.

RTÉ submitted a revised DTT plan including the FTA satellite option to the Department of Communications in mid June 2010 for approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/west-the-loser-as-rte-cuts-digital-tv-coverage-2237363.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Brian | last=McDonald | title=West the loser as RTÉ cuts digital TV coverage | date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTÉ publicly announced at an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications discussion in mid July 2010 that a free-to-air satellite service, called Saorsat, would be offered to complement the terrestrial DTT service.&lt;ref&gt;http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspxF=MAJ20100714.XML&amp;Ex=All&amp;Page=2 {{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0714/dtt.html | work=RTÉ News | title=RTÉ updates Oireachtas committee on DTT | date=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite option is a narrow-band satellite operating in the [[Ka band]] as opposed to the normal [[Direct-broadcast satellite|DTH]] [[Ku band]] (which [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and [[Freesat]] use), with a [[spot beam]] being dedicated exclusively to Ireland which will also provide coverage throughout Northern Ireland. The spot beam with frequency reuse means reception in most of Britain and continental Europe is not possible. RTÉ states that the chosen satellite option will cost approximately €1.5&amp;nbsp;million per year.

RTÉ said the combined offering was designed to be the most cost-effective solution for viewers and broadcasters; to offer for the first time 100% coverage of free-to-air public service television services in the Republic of Ireland; and to provide full national back-up coverage on satellite in the event of an emergency or catastrophic failure of the DTT system.

Approval for the revised National DTT plan and Saorsat satellite service was announced by the Minister for Communications at the end of July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/New+%e2%82%ac70+million+digital+network+to+be+built+by+RT%c3%89+including+new+satellite+service.htm {{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTÉ did not confirm that Saorsat would broadcast from [[KA-SAT]] until February 2012. There is no other current satellite solution with a spot covering only Ireland. Strictly speaking the spot covers a large part of [[Wales]], [[South West England]] and the [[Hebrides]] of [[Scotland]], but the frequency and polarisation reuse scheme means that no matter how big a dish is used, interference from a similar spot over northern [[France]] would prevent reception much beyond terrestrial overspill into Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TechTir |url=http://www.techtir.ie/saortv/saorsat-coverage |title=Saorsat Coverage &amp;#124; TechTir |publisher=Techtir.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reception over all of [[Northern Ireland]] may be possible.

At least a Ka band [[Low-noise block downconverter|LNB]], dish and DVB-S2 receiver will be required to receive Saorsat. Reception of Sky or Freesat from the Astra 2 satellites at 28° East will require a separate feed and a [[DiSEqC]] or Multiswitch with a Diseqc compatible receiver. 2rn state that a dish of 1m diameter is required for reception of Saorsat on the island of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.saorview.ie/about-saorview/saorsat/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610182204/https://www.saorview.ie/about-saorview/saorsat/ |archivedate=10 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saorview is really the RTÉ NL name for the public service broadcaster multiplexes. According to the RTÉ submission to Oireachtas committee the proposed RTÉ NL operated Saorsat is expected to be a copy of Saorview. {{As of|2011|05|28}} the test loop used the same total bitrate as the terrestrial DTT mux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyngsat.com/eka.html |title=Eutelsat Ka-Sat 9A at 9.0°E - LyngSat |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dual feed dish (with Ku and Ka LNBFs) or a separate second boxed Cassegrain "dish" is required with a Diseqc switch and HD DVB-S2 tuner to have Freesat and Saorsat on the same set-box or IDTV receiver.

RTÉ has made it clear that Saorview/Saorsat will not carry television services from outside the Republic of Ireland and that people in Ireland should seek other digital services to view additional channels other than what is offered.&lt;ref&gt;http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=MAJ20100714.XML&amp;Ex=All&amp;Page=3 {{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Irish government has already signed an agreement to permit retransmission of BBC channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0202/1224263582384.html | work=The Irish Times | title=RTÉ and TG4 to be freely available in North in 2012 | date=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing started in May 2011 on KA-SAT 9E, 20.185&amp;nbsp;GHz DVB-S2 SR25000 FEC&amp;nbsp;1/2 with pre-recorded material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wotsat.techradar.com/news/saorsat-testing-ka-sat-31-05-11|title=Saorsat testing on KA-Sat|publisher=What Satellite &amp; Digital TV|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical==

Parameters are:

*KA-SAT @ 9E&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyngsat.com/Eutelsat-9A-and-Ka-Sat-9A.html Eutelsat 9A] www.lyngsat.com.&lt;/ref&gt;
*20.185&amp;nbsp;GHz, Left Circular Polarisation, 
*DVB-S2 QPSK, 
*SR 25000 with 2/3 FEC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showpost.php?p=89661378&amp;postcount=2824] fec change&lt;/ref&gt; (was 1/2 FEC which allows about 25&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s data, about the same as the Terrestrial Mux),
*Irish spot (there are 82 spots on KA-SAT)

It's likely a second carrier will be used to carry material on the second Terrestrial PSB mux. The second DTT mux is running with no services on many sites and there is a second DVB-S2 carrier in the same part of the Ku band for Internet Services using SR 50000 with adaptive modulation and FEC.

Any DVB-S2 HD satellite receiver can in theory be used to receive Saorsat as the Ka band LNBF converts to a regular IF in the 950&amp;nbsp;MHz to 2,100&amp;nbsp;MHz band. If the receiver does not have a setting for the Ka band LNBF Lo, then a "fake" frequency 10.765 vertical rather than the real 20.185 may be entered when using the Inverto LNB with local oscillator of 21.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saortv.info/satellite-saorsat/saorsat-reception/ |title=Saorsat Reception « |publisher=Saortv.info |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To receive [[Freesat]]/Sky or other services alongside Saorsat, a dual- or multi-feed type dish or two dishes are needed with either one or more [[DiSEqC]] switches or a multi-switch. On a multi-switch the Saorsat LNB needs to be connected to vertical 0&amp;nbsp;kHz port only. The other 3 input ports are left unused.

Even with the narrow beam reception is available in the western parts of Scotland, England and Wales&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astra2.org/saorsat.html Saorsat Reception] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922072719/http://www.astra2.org/saorsat.html |date=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an LNBF on an 80&amp;nbsp;cm dish pointed at Eutelsat 9E.

==Channels==
[[TV3 (Ireland)|Virgin Media One,]] [[3e|Virgin Media Two]] and [[Be3|Virgin Media Three]] do not broadcast on Saorsat, but are available on [[Saorview]]. There is a range of channels for Saorview which are either offered from RTÉNL, or the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|BAI]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=MEDIA+AND+MARKETING-qqqs=mediaandmarketing-qqqid=49668-qqqx=1.asp{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the first music broadcasters in the United Kingdom to champion [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] in the early 1980s, providing the only national radio forum for both bands and fans. The ''[[Friday Rock Show]]'' that he hosted gave new bands airtime for their music and fans an opportunity to hear it. His radio show was a factor in the rise of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]]. He used a personal tag-line of "TV on the radio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/tommy-vance-527520.html |title=Tommy Vance | work = Obituaries |publisher=The Independent | first = Spencer | last = Leigh |date=7 March 2005 |accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His voice was heard by millions around the world announcing the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] acts at [[Live Aid]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Eighties: One Day, One Decade|last = Jones|first = Dylan|publisher = Random House|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born Richard Anthony Crispian Francis Prew Hope-Weston in Eynsham, Oxfordshire, 11 July 1940. His grandmother owned a travelling repertory company,  his father was an electronics engineer and his mother a former singer and dancer.

Expelled from school at 15 for truancy, Vance's first job was as a trainee manager at the Hyde Park Hotel, London. He joined the merchant navy in 1956 as a cabin boy at age 16. It was while docked in New York, listening to US radio, that Vance first toyed with becoming a disc jockey. He had been brought up on the British broadcasting of the fifties and, like a number of his contemporaries, fell in love with the brash sound of American commercial radio.

When Vance returned to the UK, he worked as a mechanic for a jukebox company so that he could hear music for free. Unable to find an opening in British radio he enrolled at a Northern Ireland college, becoming a part-time actor/stage hand. He joined the Ulster Bridge Repertory Company, run by the actor James Ellis, as a stage manager.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/dec/04/radio.television&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===KOL Seattle and KHJ Los Angeles===
Moving to Vancouver in pursuit of his first wife, Fern, in 1964, he joined KOL Seattle Using the pseudonym Rick West working the midnight-to-6am shift ''broadcasting to a field of sleeping cows'' as he once described it.

From there Vance moved to Los Angeles where he was offered a show by programming consultant [[Bill Drake]] on [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] radio (aka [[Boss Radio]]), holding the evening airshift at KHJ for several months in late 1965. The programme had originally been intended for another presenter who had pulled out of the deal at the last moment, the jingles and pre-launch publicity could not go to waste so Rick West became "Tommy Vance", ''"The station asked if I would take the name as they had already made the jingles for him. I said, for that kind of money you can call me what you like, mate."''

KHJ was one of the most successful and influential Top 40 stations of the era and California in 1965 was a great place to be. However, America was then involved in a war in Vietnam and when Tommy got his draft papers for the US Army, he decided it was time to head back to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs |first=Ron |title=KHJ: Inside Boss Radio |date=2010 |page=74 |publisher=Magic Broadcasting Publishers |isbn=978-0-578-06379-9 |author-link=Ron Jacobs (broadcaster)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offshore Pirate Radio===
Vance returned to the UK in 1965 just before Christmas with British musician Ian Whitcomb who lent him the fare. Tommy knocked on the door of Caroline House in London, no programme controller was going to pass up on the opportunity to employ a KHJ boss jock and Caroline's Bill Hearne was no exception.
He was hired by [[Radio Caroline]] South, where his colleagues included Johnnie Walker, Dave Lee Travis, Tony Blackburn and Emperor Rosko. On 3 January 1966 Vance presented his first show on Caroline South, his slogan was "TV on radio" and used [[Jack Costanzo]]'s version of the "Naked City Theme" as his signature tune.

In 1966, Vance released a handful of singles, "You Must Be the One" a covers of Herman's Hermits', 'Silhouettes' and a cover of The Rolling Stones, "Off the Hook".
Vance’s Wife was not best pleased with the idea that her husband was going to be on a ship two weeks out of three and it would mean she would be living in an unfamiliar city on her own, So Vance left Caroline after a few months and moved to [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]]. The marriage did not last so when Caroline's Ronan O'Rahilly suggested Tommy should return to the ship there was nothing to stop him, and he rejoined in December 1966.

During the summer of 1967 it became apparent that the government was going to legislate against the offshore stations. Tommy heard a rumour that Philip Birch, boss of [[Wonderful Radio London]], was negotiating to move his station to France and he wanted to be a part of it. In July 1967 he transferred to Radio London. Unfortunately Big L failed to find a base on the continent. Rather than break the new law, it chose to close down on 14 August so Tommy's stay with the station was brief.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/tommy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio 1 and Capital Radio===
After the pirates were closed down in 1967, the BBC's new station, [[BBC Radio 1]], adopted much of their musical philosophy and took on many of their personnel including Caroline colleagues John Peel, Tony Blackburn and Johnnie Walker. Vance co-hosted the "progressive" show ''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]'' with [[John Peel]]. When the programme was given to Peel to present solo, Vance presented the popular weekly programme "Pop Club" on the BBC World Service. Each instalment of the programme started with Cliff Richard. Members of the "Pop Club" got special badges and membership cards.

Frustrated with his lack of progress, however, Vance joined Radio Monte Carlo International with Dave Cash and Kenny Everett. In October 1973 all three would join the new London-based [[Capital London|Capital Radio]], Britain's first legal commercial pop station, initially co-presenting the morning show with Joan Shenton and then playing reggae and soul music on a weekend show. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/tommy-vance-527520.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Vance made a film appearance as disc jockey, Ricky Storm, in Richard Loncraine's [[Slade in Flame]], a vehicle for the group Slade.&lt;ref&gt;Film end credits&lt;/ref&gt; By 1976, Vance was also on the [[Portsmouth]] [[Independent Local Radio|ILR]] station [[Radio Victory]]. 

Vance hosted Capital's first reggae show and, at a time when punk was being shunned by the press, he carried out the first in-depth interview with [[Johnny Rotten]] of the [[Sex Pistols]] in 1977, in which Rotten talked at length about his love of reggae music, at a time when the group were given very little media exposure elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===BBC and the Friday Rock Show===
Vance returned to Radio 1 in November 1978 to begin a 15-year stint hosting the show for which he is best remembered — the ''[[Friday Rock Show]]''. He was to become associated with [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[rock music]]; his deep, resonant, booming voice and catch-phrase 'classic cuts' have been much imitated. The first record which he played on the show, and with which he finished on his final programme in 1993, was '[[Rock 'n' Roll Damnation]]' by [[AC/DC]]. A 1983 edition was the first radio programme to use only compact discs. His signature music was "Take It Off the Top" by Dixie Dreggs and then he would say in his gravelly voice, "Hi, this is TV on the radio and welcome to the programme that we call the Friday Rock Show." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first= John| last= Van der Kiste| year= 2016| title= Pop Pickers and Music Vendors| publisher= Fonthill Media| location= Stroud| isbn= | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vance had a two-year stint (10 January 1982 to 1 January 1984) hosting the Sunday-afternoon [[UK Singles Chart|Top 40]], where he showed knowledge of and enthusiasm for a wide range of music and displayed a similar keenness when he hosted ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' around the same time. He also deputised on the Top 40 for [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] (in 1984 and 1985), [[Bruno Brookes]] (in 1987) and [[Mark Goodier]] (in 1991 and 1992).

Vance was a daily presenter on [[BFBS]] from 1976 to 1987 and so he also became known in Germany, where BFBS was popular among a civilian audience despite being aimed officially at British military personnel. He also presented a weekly chart show for BFBS as well as other programmes such as ''Soul Bowl''. As well as presenting the best-selling singles chart of 1982 and 1983, he also presented the equivalent show in 1991 despite not presenting the weekly chart at the time. 

In 1984 to 1985, Tommy Vance hosted a Thursday night AOR programme on Radio 1, "Into the Music."  This was in place for about a year before being taken off in favour of [[Andy Kershaw]].  At a similar time, the "Friday Rock Show" gained an extra hour on MW only, during which the rock charts were played.

When the BBC's new radio station for London, [[Greater London Radio]] (GLR), was launched in 1988, Vance presented the drivetime show, mixing [[album-oriented rock]] and current affairs dubbed "rock and rolling news". He also became the continuity announcer for BBC2 and interviewed for the BBC World Service.
He was a frequent choice as master of ceremonies at award shows, concerts and festivals; such as [[Monsters of Rock]] at [[Donington Park]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/07/guardianobituaries.radio&lt;/ref&gt; 
Vance departed Radio 1 in March 1993, however, he continued to host ''Rock Salad'' for BBC World Service for many years.

===Later years===
Tommy was a key player in the launch of [[Virgin Radio]] in March 1993, presenting the Drivetime show, a move he later regretted as the station dropped its adventurous format in favour of an ad-driven playlist.

Vance co-founded the internet radio station Rock Radio Network with his former Radio 1 producer Tony Wilson, music promoter [[Andrew King (music manager)|Andy King]] and journalist [[Malcolm Dome]] in 1997, rebranding as [[TotalRock]] in 2000.

Vance developed business interests with the Silk Sound studios in Soho, later joined by The Bridge. He revived the Friday Rock Show for the digital channel [[VH1]] which ran for some years until 2002. He  featured twice in the Channel 4 comedy series, ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'', the spot was called Tommy Vance's News Slam in which he took a minute to read out news headlines.{{cn|date=October 2017}} He was presenter and voiceover for the [[Five (TV)|Channel 5]] series ''[[Dumber and Dumber]]'' and had a much quoted appearance on ''[[Brass Eye]]''. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0888567/&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps his most memorable TV appearance came in 2004 when he walked out of ITV's ''[[Hell's Kitchen (UK TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]''. He decided to leave the show after escaping a scalding from boiling fat and foulmouthed abuse from the celebrity chef, [[Gordon Ramsey]].  Vance's agent stated that he felt the environment was "dangerous" and that he was a risk to himself and the other contestants due to his age.&lt;ref name = "bbcnews"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3750529.stm | title = Stars walk out of Hell's Kitchen | date = 26 May 2004 | accessdate = 3 October 2010 | quote = He is not a young man and unless you are seriously trained it is very dangerous. He left to save his own finger and somebody else's. | work = [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Vance moved to Spain, it was with the intention of a gentle semi-retirement. It was not long before he was back on the air playing music for the tourists and ex-pats on the Costa del Sol's Spectrum FM. Vance came back to Britain and threw himself into work again, doing commercials, appearing on television and returning to Virgin to present a weekly show on their DAB and internet offshoot, Virgin Classic Rock.

== Death ==
Vance died at [[Darent Valley Hospital]] in [[Dartford (borough)|Dartford, Kent]] in the early hours of 6 March 2005, three days after suffering a [[stroke]] at his home.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1485055/Ex-Radio-1-DJ-Tommy-Vance-dies.html DJ Tommy Vance dies at Daily Telegraph]. Retrieved 27 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He said of death, ''"When you're gone, you're gone, I don't want anybody weeping for me."'' Vance is survived by his ex-wife, their son and daughter.

== Tributes ==
On 11 March 2005, five days after Vance's death, [[TotalRock]] ran ''Rock On, Tommy Day'', a 15-hour live broadcast celebrating his life and work, including lots of music, numerous testimonials from artists and colleagues, and also from people who wrote down their thoughts on Tommy at a special Forum, ''In Memoriam: Tommy Vance'', put up at the TotalRock website. As a finale, after the actual live broadcast had ended, the last [[Friday Rock Show]] Vance recorded for [[BBC Radio 1]] in 1993 was re-broadcast.

On 31 March 2006, a Tommy Vance Tribute Night, in association with the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]] foundation, was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. [[Judas Priest]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] and [[Ian Gillan]] all performed to pay tribute. There were also special stage appearances by [[Roger Daltrey]] and [[Bruce Dickinson]].

In early 2018, it was announced that a new festival, Stonedeaf, would be naming their stage after Tommy Vance. In true Monsters of Rock fashion with one day and one stage, held at Newark Showground on the same weekend.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stonedeaffestival.co.uk/line-up/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Álvaro VII''' (Mpanzu-a-Mabondo) was king of the [[Kingdom of Congo]] from 1665 to 1666.

When the death of [[António I of Kongo|Antonio I]] at the [[Battle of Mbwila]] (October 29, 1665) was announced, a relative of the dead sovereign, Álvaro, was proclaimed king.

The new king sent a trusted [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monk, [[Friar]] Girolamo of Montesarchio, to make peace with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in to [[Luanda]], [[Angola]], in [[Christmas]] 1665. But the monk was waylaid by a rebellion in [[Mbamba]], and only returned to the capital in June 1666, where he found Álvaro VII already dead; in the meantime, the powerful [[Count of Soyo]], Paulo da Silva, had marched on [[M'banza-Kongo|São Salvador]] (the capital of the kingdom), killed the king and proclaimed [[Álvaro VIII of Kongo|Álvaro VIII]] in his place.
