[[File:Alciphron (1732) title page.jpg|thumb|''Alciphron'' title page (1732).]]
'''''Alciphron''''', or '''''The Minute Philosopher''''' is an [[anticatholic]] philosophical [[dialogue]] by the 18th-century Irish philosopher [[George Berkeley]] wherein Berkeley combated the arguments of [[free-thinkers]] such as [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville]] and [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] against the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[religion]]. It was first published in 1732.

The dialogue is primarily between four characters, the free-thinkers Alciphron and Lysicles, Berkeley's spokesman Euphranor, and Crito, who serves as a spokesman for traditional Christianity. The mostly-silent narrator of the dialogue is given the name Dion.

The work contains two especially notable sections:
* Dialogue IV, in which Berkeley presents a novel [[teleological argument]] for the existence of [[God]] based on Berkeley's theory of visual language, defended in the ''[[Essay Toward a New Theory of Vision]]'' (first published in 1709, and included with the first edition of ''Alciphron'').&lt;ref&gt;See David Kline, "Berkeley's Divine Language Argument" in Ernest Sosa, ed., ''Essays on the Philosophy of George Berkeley'' (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1987), repr. in David Berman, ed., ''Alciphron in Focus'' (London: Routledge, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Dialogue VII, in which Berkeley presents a novel theory of language which has been compared with the theory of language advocated by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his ''Philosophical Investigations''.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Flew, "Was Berkeley a Precursor of Wittgenstein?" in W. B. Todd, ed. ''Hume and the Enlightenment: Essays Presented to Ernest Campbell Mossner'' (Edinburgh: The University Press, 1974), repr. in Berman, ed., ''Alciphron''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a later work, ''[[The Theory of Vision Vindicated and Explained]]'' (first published in 1733), Berkeley adduced the work of [[Alberto Radicati]] as evidence that the views advocated by the character Lysicles were not overly exaggerated (para. 5).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22851">{{Greek dialects}}
[[Ancient Greek]] in [[Classical Antiquity|classical antiquity]], before the development of the [[Koine Greek|κοινή]] (koiné) "common" language of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], was divided into several '''[[dialects]]'''. Most of them are known only from inscriptions, but a few of them, principally [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]], [[Doric Greek|Doric]], and [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], are also represented in the literary canon alongside the dominant [[Attic Greek|Attic]] form of literary Greek. Likewise, [[Modern Greek]] is divided into several dialects, most of them having been derived from Koine Greek.

==Provenance==
* The earliest known Greek dialect is  '''[[Mycenaean Greek]]''', the language attested from the [[Linear B]] tablets produced by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]] of the [[Late Bronze Age]] in the late [[2nd millennium BC]]. The classical distribution of dialects was brought about by the migrations of the early [[Iron Age]]&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called the [[Greek Dark Ages]] because writing disappeared from Greece until the adaptation of the Phoenician alphabet.&lt;/ref&gt; after the collapse of the [[Mycenaean civilization]].  Some speakers of Mycenaean were displaced to [[Cyprus]] while others remained inland in [[Arcadia]], giving rise to the '''[[Arcadocypriot]]''' dialect. This is the only dialect with a known Bronze-age precedent. The other dialects must have preceded their attested forms but the relationship of the precedents to Mycenaean remains to be discovered.
* '''[[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]]''' was spoken in three subdialects: one, Lesbian, on the island of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]] and the west coast of Asia Minor north of [[Smyrna]].  The other two, Boeotian and Thessalian, were spoken in the northeast of the Greek mainland (in Boeotia and Thessalia).
*The [[Dorian invasion]]  spread '''[[Doric Greek]]''' from a probable location in northwestern Greece to the coast of the [[Peloponnesus]]; for example, to [[Sparta]], to [[Crete]] and to the southernmost parts of the west coast of [[Asia Minor]]. '''North Western Greek''' is sometimes classified as a separate dialect, and is sometimes subsumed under Doric. '''[[Ancient Macedonian language|Macedonian]]''' is regarded by some scholars as another Greek dialect, possibly related to Doric or NW Greek.&lt;ref name= OxfordCD1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Masson | first = Olivier | title=[Ancient] Macedonian language|editor1 = Hornblower, S.|editor2 = Spawforth A. | encyclopedia = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary|The Oxford Classical Dictionary]] | origyear = 1996 | edition = revised 3rd | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = USA | isbn =0-19-860641-9 | pages =905–906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hammond1&gt;{{cite book| last= Hammond| first= N.G.L |authorlink= Nicholas Hammond (historian)|title= The Macedonian State.

*'''[[Ionic Greek|Ionic]]''' was mostly spoken along the west coast of Asia Minor, including Smyrna and the area to the south of it, but also in [[Euboea]]. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' were written in '''[[Homeric Greek]]''' (or Epic Greek), an early East Greek blending Ionic and Aeolic features.  '''[[Attic Greek]]''', a sub- or sister-dialect of Ionic, was for centuries the language of [[Athens]]. Because Attic was adopted in [[Macedon]] before the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and the subsequent rise of Hellenism, it became the "standard" dialect that evolved into the [[Koine Greek|Koiné]].

==Literature==
{{See also|:Category:Ancient Greek writers by dialect}}
Ancient Greek literature is written in literary dialects that developed from particular regional or archaic dialects. Ancient Greek authors did not necessarily write in their native dialect, but rather chose a dialect that was suitable or traditional for the type of literature they were writing (see [[belles-lettres]]).&lt;ref&gt;Greek mythology and poetics By Gregory Nagy. Page 51] {{ISBN|978-0-8014-8048-5}} (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sihler |first=Andrew Littleton |year=1995 |title=New Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin |pp=10–12 | location=New York, Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-508345-8 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; All dialects have poetry written in them, but only Attic and Ionic have full works of prose attested.

[[Homeric Greek]] is used in the first [[epic poetry|epic poems]], the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]], and the [[Homeric Hymns]], traditionally attributed to [[Homer]] and written in [[dactylic hexameter]]. Homeric is a literary dialect with elements of Ionic, Aeolic and Arcadocypriot. [[Hesiod]] uses a similar dialect, and later writers imitate Homer in their epics, such as [[Apollonius Rhodius]] in [[Argonautica]] and [[Nonnus]] in [[Dionysiaca]].&lt;ref&gt;Homer and the epic: a shortened version of The songs of Homer By Geoffrey Stephen Kirk  [https://books.google.com/books?id=jhPh7PT51-QC&amp;pg=PA76 Page 76 (1965)]&lt;/ref&gt; Homer influenced other types of poetry as well.

Ionic proper is first used in [[Archilochus]] of Paros. This dialect includes also the earliest Greek prose, that of [[Heraclitus]] and Ionic philosophers, [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]] and [[logographer (history)|logographers]], [[Herodotus]], [[Democritus]], and [[Hippocrates]]. [[Elegiac]] poetry originated in [[Ionia]] and always continued to be written in [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]].&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Greek Literature: From the Earliest Period to the Death of Demosthenes'' by Frank Byron Jevons (1894) Page 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Classical Greek Literature: Volume 2. The Prose Writers'' (Paperback)
by John Pentland Mahaffy Page 194 {{ISBN|1-4021-7041-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doric Greek|Doric]] is the conventional dialect of choral lyric poetry, which includes the Laconian [[Alcman]], the Theban [[Pindar]] and the choral songs of Attic tragedy ([[stasimon|stasima]]). Several lyric and epigrammatic poets wrote in this dialect, such as [[Ibycus]] of [[Rhegium]] and [[Leonidas of Tarentum]]. The following authors wrote in Doric, preserved in fragments: [[Epicharmus]] comic poet and writers of South Italian Comedy ([[phlyax play]]), [[Mithaecus]] food writer and [[Archimedes]].

[[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]] is an exclusively poetic lyric dialect, represented by [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] for Lesbian (Aeolic) and [[Corinna of Tanagra]] for Boeotian.

Thessalic (Aeolic), Northwest Doric, [[Arcado-Cypriot]] and [[Pamphylian Greek|Pamphylian]] never became literary dialects and are only known from inscriptions, and to some extent by the comical parodies of [[Aristophanes]] and lexicographers.

[[Attic Greek|Attic]] proper was used by the [[Attic orators]], [[Lysias]], [[Isocrates]], [[Aeschines]] and [[Demosthenes]], the philosophers [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] and the historian [[Xenophon]]. [[Thucydides]] wrote in Old Attic. The [[Greek tragedy|tragic playwrights]] [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] wrote in an artificial poetic language,&lt;ref&gt;Helen By Euripides, William Allan Page 43 {{ISBN|0-521-54541-2}} (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ancient Greek comedy|comic playwright]] [[Aristophanes]] writes in a language with [[vernacular]] elements.

==Classification==
===Ancient classification===
The ancients classified the language into three ''[[Genos|gene]]'' or four dialects, Ionic proper, Ionic (Attic), Aeolic, Doric and later a fifth one, [[Koine Greek|Koine]].&lt;ref&gt;New Documents Illustrating Early Christianity: Volume 5, Linguistic Essays With Cumulative Indexes to Vols. 1-5 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rttiI4LE7twC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Ionic+Doric+Aeolic+gene&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=Ionic%20Doric%20Aeolic%20gene&amp;f=false Page 30] {{ISBN|0-8028-4517-7}} (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History Of The Language Sciences By Sylvain Auroux [https://books.google.com/books?id=mL9erLJ5afUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA440&amp;dq=Strabo+8.1.2+dialects&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=Strabo%208.1.2%20dialects&amp;f=false Page 440]  {{ISBN|3-11-016736-0}} (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Grammarians focus mainly on the literary dialects and isolated words. Historians may classify dialects on mythological/historical reasons rather than linguistic knowledge. According to Strabo, "Ionic is the same as Attic and Aeolic the same as Doric - Outside the Isthmus, all Greeks were Aeolians except the Athenians, the Megarians and the Dorians who live about Parnassus - In the Peloponnese, Achaeans were also Aeolians but only Eleans and Arcadians continued to speak Aeolic".&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] 8.1.2 14.5.26&lt;/ref&gt; However, for most ancients, Aeolic was synonymous with literary Lesbic.&lt;ref&gt;Mendez Dosuna, The Aeolic dialects&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] characterized Boeotian as Aeolic and Aetolian as Doric.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], Ethnika s.v. Ionia&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkable is the ignorance of sources, except lexicographers, on Arcadian, Cypriot and Pamphylian.

However, the plural 'dialektoi' is used when dialects and peculiar words are compared and listed by the grammarians under the terms 'lexeis'&lt;ref&gt;[[LSJ]]  [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry%3D%2362384 lexis]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202133428/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2362384 |date=December 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 'glôssai'.&lt;ref&gt;Ataktoi Glôssai (Disorderly Words) by [[Philitas of Cos]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern classification===
The dialects of [[Classical Antiquity]] are grouped slightly differently by various authorities. [[Pamphylian Greek|Pamphylian]] is a marginal dialect of [[Asia Minor]] and is sometimes left uncategorized. Mycenaean was deciphered only in 1952 and so is missing from the earlier schemes presented here:

==Phonology==
The Ancient Greek dialects differed mainly in [[vowel]]s.

===Hiatus===
Loss of intervocalic ''s'' and consonantal ''i'' and ''w'' from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] brought two vowels together in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], a circumstance often called a "collision of vowels".&lt;ref&gt;Two vowels together are not to be confused with a [[diphthong]], which is two vowel sounds within the same syllable, often spelled with two letters. Greek diphthongs were typically inherited from Proto-Indo-European.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Greek speakers would change pronunciation to avoid such a collision, and the way that vowels changed determined the dialect.

For example, the word for the "god of the sea" (regardless of the culture and language from which it came) was in some prehistoric form ''*poseidāwōn'' ([[genitive case|genitive]] ''*poseidāwonos''). Loss of the intervocalic *''w'' left ''poseidāōn'', which is found in both [[Mycenaean Greek|Mycenaean]] and [[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] dialects. Ionic Greek changed the *''a'' to an e (''poseideōn''), while Attic Greek contracted it to ''poseidōn''. It changed differently in other dialects:{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
*Corinthian: ''potedāwoni'' &gt; ''potedāni'' and ''potedān''
*Boeotian: ''poteidāoni''
*Cretan, Rhodian and Delphian: ''poteidān''
*Lesbian: ''poseidān''
*Arcadian: ''posoidānos''
*Laconian: ''pohoidān''

The changes appear designed to place one vowel phoneme instead of two, a process called "contraction", if a third phoneme is created, and "hyphaeresis" ("taking away") if one phoneme is dropped and the other kept. Sometimes, the two phonemes are kept, sometimes modified, as in the Ionic ''poseideōn''.

===''Ā''===
A vowel shift differentiating the Ionic and Attic dialects from the rest was the shift of ''ā'' ({{lang|grc|ᾱ}}) to ''ē'' ({{lang|grc|η}}). In Ionic, the change occurred in all positions, but in Attic, it occurred almost everywhere except after ''e'', ''i'', and ''r'' ({{lang|grc|ε, ι, ρ}}). [[Homeric Greek]] shows the Ionic rather than the Attic version of the vowel shift for the most part. Doric and Aeolic show the original forms with ''ā'' ({{lang|grc|ᾱ}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Weir Smyth|Smyth]], ''Greek Grammar'', [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_uni.htm#30 paragraph 30] on [[Christian Classics Ethereal Library|CCEL]]: vowel change involving ''ē'', ''ā''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Attic and Ionic ''mētēr'' ({{lang|grc|μήτηρ}}); Doric ''mātēr'' ({{lang|grc|μᾱ́τηρ}}) "mother"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|mh/thr|μήτηρ}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare Latin ''māter'')
*Attic ''neāniās'' ({{lang|grc|νεᾱνίᾱς}}); Ionic ''neēniēs'' ({{lang|grc|νεηνίης}}) "young man"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|neani/as|νεᾱνίας}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ablaut===
Another principle of vocalic dialectization follows the [[Indo-European ablaut]] series or vowel grades. The [[Proto-Indo-European language]] could interchange ''e'' (e-grade) with ''o'' (o-grade) or use neither (zero-grade). Similarly, Greek inherited the series, for example, ''ei'', ''oi'', ''i'', which are e-, o- and zero-grades of the diphthong respectively. They could appear in different verb forms &amp;ndash; [[present tense|present]] ''leipo'' ({{lang|grc|λείπω}}) "I leave", [[perfect tense|perfect]] ''leloipa'' ({{lang|grc|λέλοιπα}}) "I have left", [[aorist]] ''elipon'' ({{lang|grc|ἔλιπον}}) "I left" &amp;ndash; or be used as the basis of dialectization: Attic ''deiknūmi'' ({{lang|grc|δείκνῡμι}}) "I point out" but Cretan ''diknumi'' ({{lang|grc|δίκνῡμι}})&lt;!-- presuming vowel length is the same --&gt;.

==Post-Hellenistic==
{{Main|Varieties of Modern Greek}}
The ancient Greek dialects were a result of isolation and poor communication between communities living in broken terrain. All general Greek historians point out the influence of terrain on the development of the city-states. Often, the development of languages dialectization results in the dissimilation of daughter languages. That phase did not occur in Greek; instead the dialects were replaced by Standard Greek.

Increasing population and communication brought speakers more closely in touch and united them under the same authorities. Attic Greek became the literary language everywhere. Buck says:&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Dialects''{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "… long after Attic had become the norm of literary prose, each state employed its own dialect, both in private and public monuments of internal concern, and in those of a more… interstate character, such as… treaties…."

In the first few centuries BC, regional dialects replaced local ones: Northwest Greek koine, Doric koine and Attic koine. The last came to replace the others in common speech in the first few centuries AD. After the division of the [[Roman Empire]] into the east and the west the earliest Modern Greek prevailed. The dialect distribution was then as follows:
* [[Attic Greek]]
** [[Koine Greek|Koiné]]
*** [[Byzantine Greek language]]
**** [[Modern Greek]]
***** [[Modern Greek|Demotic Greek]]
***** [[Katharevousa]]
**** [[Yevanic language|Yevanic]]
**** [[Cypriot Greek]]
**** [[Cretan Greek]]
**** Southern Italian Greek ([[Griko language|Griko]] and [[Calabrian Greek dialect|Calabrian/Bovesian]]), retaining some Doric elements
*** [[Pontic Greek language|Pontic Greek]], retaining some Ionic elements
*** [[Cappadocian Greek]]
*** [[Romano-Greek language|Romano-Greek]]
* [[Doric Greek]]
** Doric Koiné
*** [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]]

According to some scholars, Tsakonian is the only modern Greek dialect that descends from Doric, albeit with some influence from the Koine.&lt;ref&gt;Medieval and modern Greek By Robert Browning [https://books.google.com/books?id=b55B1J7I99AC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=Tsakonian+Doric#v=onepage&amp;q=Tsakonian%20Doric&amp;f=false Page 124] {{ISBN|0-521-29978-0}}  (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Others include the Southern Italian dialects in this group, though perhaps they should rather be regarded as descended from the local Doric-influenced variant of the Koine.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ashutosh Mukhopadhyay.jpg|thumb|right|'''Ashutosh Mukhopadhyay''' (1920-1989)]]

'''Ashutosh Mukhopadhyay''' (anglicised spelling of surname: '''Mukherjee ''') was one of the most prominent writers of modern [[Bengali literature]].

==Life and works==
He was born on September 7, 1920 in Bajrajogini, Dacca (now [[Dhaka]]) as the fifth of ten children of a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Brahmin]] couple, Paresh Chandra Mukhopadhyay and Tarubala Devi.&lt;ref
name="sonar"&gt;[[Blurb]] of ''Sonar Harin Nei'', novel by Ashutosh Mukhopadhyay, Combined edition, Kolkata: Mitra &amp; Ghosh, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Mukhopadyay graduated in commerce from [[Hooghly Mohsin College]], then affiliated with the [[University of Calcutta]]. His first story was ''Nurse Mitra'', published in the newspaper [https://web.archive.org/web/20070406175354/http://www.calcuttaweb.com/newspapers.shtml Basumati], which was later made into major movies ([[Deep Jwélé Jaai|Deep Jwele Jai]] in Bengali and [[Khamoshi]] in Hindi). [[Bollywood]] films like ''[[Safar (1970 film)|Safar]]'' (1970) and ''[[Bemisal]]'' were also made from his novels.

His first novel was ''Swaha'', also published in ''Basumati'' and later renamed as ''Ruper Hate Bikikini''. His first published novel was ''Kaalchakra'', but he made his mark as novelist with his fourth published novel, ''Chalachal'',&lt;ref
name="sonar"/&gt; especially from its successful cinematisation&lt;ref name="click"&gt;[http://clickforboi.in/authorinfo/%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%B6%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%B7%20%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%96%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A7%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC/ Click for বই: Author Info - আশুতোষ মুখোপাধ্যায়] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908223816/http://clickforboi.in/authorinfo/%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%B6%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%B7%20%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%96%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A7%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC/ |date=September 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Asit Sen (director)|Asit Sen]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gomolo.com/chalachal-movie/13570&lt;/ref&gt; The cinematisation of ''Panchatapa'' in 1957 by the same director,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gomolo.com/panchatapa-movie/13645&lt;/ref&gt; further enhanced the writer's reputation.&lt;ref
name="click"/&gt;

He joined the newspaper [[Amrita Bazar Patrika|Jugantar]] in 1955 after joining and leaving nine jobs&lt;ref
name="click"/&gt; and subsequently became the head of the Sunday special of the newspaper. He died on May 4, 1989.

Ashutosh Mukhopadhyay was one of the most cinematised authors of Bengali literature. Some of the movies made from his stories and novels are listed below. Many of his novels have been translated in other Indian languages. Love and romance and the human relationship are recurring themes of his novels.

== Some published works ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="853">The '''average call duration''' ('''ACD''') is a measurement in [[telecommunications]] that reflects an average length of telephone calls transmitted on [[telecommunication network]]s.

The measurement is typically based on the reporting by telecommunication equipment via [[call detail record]]s. [[Sample_(statistics)|Samples]] are collected to determine traffic demand and forecast call volumes, serving also as a tool for infrastructure monitoring of [[Switching_center|switches]] and cables. Depending on the type of call being made, ACD can be used as a proxy measure of call quality.

A '''benefit''' is a match or season of activities granted by a sporting body to a loyal sportsman to boost their income before retirement. Often this is in the form of a match for which all the ticket proceeds are given to the player in question. However hosting one of these matches is a risk for the player in question as he/she is responsible for paying any relevant receipts and collects any excess income from the match, therefore income from such matches is more often than not reliant on attendance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/abs/10.1080/09523369908714056#.VS4qvpSUcmV|title = County cricketers’ benefits and testimonials, 1946–85,|last = Sadiford &amp; Vamplew|first = Keith A.P &amp; Wray|date = 1999|journal = The International Journal of the History of Sport|doi = 10.1080/09523369908714056|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, the "beneficiary" can opt to give part or all of the money to charity. An example of this is [[Paul Collingwood]]'s 2007 benefit with [[Durham County Cricket Club]]. This may also occur when sportsmen unite for a cause, for example the [[Rafael Nadal]] vs [[Roger Federer]] "[[Match for Africa]]" (2010) where more than $2.6 million was raised for the [[Roger Federer Foundation]], enabling children living in poverty to realise their potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.match-for-africa.com/en/|title = Match for Africa 2|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rogerfedererfoundation.org/en/home/|title = Roger Federer Foundation|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/12/Other/Charity-Nadal-Federer-In-Madrid.aspx|title = Nadal, Federer Unite For Children In Madrid|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = ATP World Tour|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Benefit matches originated in English [[county cricket]] in a time period where playing sport, in particular cricket, for a living didn't offer as big of an income as it does in modern society (2015), holding a benefit at a player's 10 year service mark or retirement mark was considered a form of retirement/insurance policy. Benefit matches are confused with [[Testimonial match]]es, it's important to note that this is a direct gift from the club where income is guaranteed unlike in a benefit where income is often dependent on attendance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similar events were organised in Baseball in the 1860s, these events often occurred at season end involving the stars of the sport to acknowledge a significant member of the sport. However a rule established by the NABBP in 1859 prohibited any player compensation, the basis of this rule was to maintain fair game in competition and avoid professional vs. amateur situations arising.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early Professional Baseball and The Sporting Press|last = Furst|first = R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2072">'''Brian Rua''' (c.1648–?) is a well-known 17th century Errisman.  He is remembered as the prophet of [[Erris]], a large Barony in the north west of County Mayo.  Papers relating to the life and the prophecies of Brian Rua, known collectively as "''Tarngaireacht Bhriain Ruaidh''" were destroyed, apparently by  his own son, who lost his temper with his father when the two had one of their regular disagreements.

Brian Rua lived in the parish of [[Kilcommon]] in the townland of Inver.  Believed to have been born around the year 1648, the story of Brian Rua is known by every person, man, woman and child in Kilcommon parish into this 21st century.  Passed down through the mouths of the people through successive generations from the 17th century, in 1906 a renowned Celtic scholar called Michael Timoney from [[Lahardane]] set out to collect the story of Brian Rua and publish it, so that it would not be forgotten. The stories were carried down the generations in the [[Irish language]] and published in that language.  In 2000, as part of the Millennium Project, the story was translated into English and published as part of the book 'Traditional Cures and Gifted People' by Philomena Cronin.

'''Call2''' is an international [[Callback (telecommunications)|callback]] provider, founded in 1997 in the [[United Kingdom]] by Peter Farrer and merged by [[Andrew Try]] in 1999 to form Comxo Trading Ltd. Their offices are located just outside [[London]], [[England]].

Call2 offers a unique way of initiating long distance and international calls. The system works by receiving a request for a call from the user, via Internet, Phone or [[SMS]],&lt;ref name="sixthings"&gt;''PCWorld.com'' [http://www.pcworld.com/article/128726-2/six_things_you_never_knew_your_cell_phone_could_do.html "Six Things You Never Knew Your Cell Phone Could Do"]&lt;/ref&gt; and initiating a [[Callback (telecommunications)|callback]]. This callback dials both the user's number and the person they wish to call, and connects the two calls together. This functionality allows users to avoid the high international call costs imposed by some telephone providers, and even reduce [[roaming]] costs. Call2 differs from many other online international call services in that the calls are routed over [[PSTN]] lines, not [[VoIP]], and require no additional software or hardware, such as headsets.&lt;ref name="howworks"&gt;''Call2.com'' [https://www.call2.com/how_works.cfm "How does Call2 Work?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ProgLangCompare}}

In [[formal language|formal language theory]] and [[computer programming]], '''string concatenation ''' is the operation of joining [[character string (computer science)|character strings]] [[wikt:end-to-end|end-to-end]].  For example, the concatenation of "snow" and "ball" is "snowball". In some but not all formalisations of [[concatenation theory]], also called string theory, string concatenation is a [[primitive notion]].

==Syntax==
In many [[programming language]]s, string concatenation is a [[binary operation|binary]] [[infix operator]].  The &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; (plus) operator is often [[operator overloading|overloaded]] to denote concatenation for string arguments: &lt;code&gt;"Hello, " + "World"&lt;/code&gt; has the value &lt;code&gt;"Hello, World"&lt;/code&gt;. In other languages there is a separate operator, particularly to specify implicit type conversion to string, as opposed to more complicated behavior for generic plus. Examples include &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; in [[Edinburgh IMP]], Perl, and PHP, &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; in Ada, AppleScript, and Visual Basic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/te2585xw.aspx Concatenation Operators in Visual Basic]&lt;/ref&gt; Other syntax exists, like &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; in PL/I and [[Oracle Database]] [[SQL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/operators003.htm Concatenation Operator]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few languages, notably C, C++, and Python, there is [[string literal concatenation]], meaning that adjacent [[string literal]]s are concatenated, without any operator: &lt;code&gt;"Hello, " "World"&lt;/code&gt; has the value &lt;code&gt;"Hello, World"&lt;/code&gt;. In other languages, concatenation of string literals with an operator is evaluated at compile time, via [[constant folding]], although this is often an implementation detail of the compiler, rather than a language feature.

==Implementation==
In programming, string concatenation generally occurs at run time, as string values are not in general known until run time. However, in the case of string literals, the values are known at compile time, and thus string concatenation can be done at compile time, either via [[string literal concatenation]] or via [[constant folding]].

==Concatenation of sets of strings==
In [[formal language|formal language theory]] and [[pattern matching]] (including [[regular expressions]]), the concatenation operation on strings is generalised to an operation on sets of strings as follows:

For two sets of strings ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''concatenation'' ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all strings of the form ''vw'' where ''v'' is a string from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''w'' is a string from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or formally {{math|1=''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {{mset| ''vw'' : ''v'' ∈ ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''w'' ∈ ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; }}}}. Many authors also use concatenation of a string set and a single string, and vice versa, which are defined similarly by {{math|1=''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''w'' = {{mset| ''vw'' : ''v'' ∈ ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; }}}} and {{math|1=''vS''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {{mset| ''vw'' : ''w'' ∈ ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; }}}}. In these definitions, the string ''vw'' is the ordinary concatenation of strings ''v'' and ''w'' as defined in the introductory section.

For example, if {{math|1=''F'' = {{mset| a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h }}}}, and {{math|1=''R'' = {{mset| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 }}}}, then ''FR'' denotes the set of all [[chess board]] coordinates in [[algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic notation]], while e''R'' denotes the set of all coordinates of the kings' [[file (chess)|file]].

In this context, sets of strings are often referred to as formal languages.  The concatenation operator is usually expressed as simple juxtaposition (as with [[multiplication]]).

==Algebraic properties==

The strings over an alphabet, with the concatenation operation, form an [[associative property|associative]] algebraic structure with identity element the [[null string]]&amp;mdash;a [[free monoid]].

Sets of strings with concatenation and [[Alternation (formal language theory)|alternation]] form a [[semiring]], with concatenation (*) [[distributive property|distributing]] over alternation (+); 0 is the [[empty set]] and 1 the set consisting of just the null string.

==Applications==

===Audio/telephony===
In programming for telephony, concatenation is used to provide dynamic audio feedback to a user. For example, in a "time of day" [[speaking clock]], concatenation is used to give the correct time by playing the appropriate recordings ''concatenated'' together. For example:

* "At the tone the time will be"
* "Eight"
* "Thirty"
* "Five"
* "and"
* "Twenty"
* "Two"
* "Seconds"

The recordings themselves exist separately, but playing them one after the other provides a grammatically correct sentence to the listener.

This technique is also used in number change announcements, [[voice mail]] systems, or most telephony applications that provide dynamic feedback to the caller (e.g. [[moviefone]], [[tellme]], and others).

Programming for any kind of computerised public address system can also employ concatenation for dynamic public announcements (for example, flights in an airport). The system would archive recorded speech of numbers, routes or airlines, destinations, times, etc. and play them back in a specific sequence to produce a grammatically correct sentence that is announced throughout the facility.

===Database theory===
One of the principles of [[relational database]] design is that the fields of data tables should reflect a single characteristic of the table's subject, which means that they should not contain concatenated strings. When concatenation is desired in a report, it should be provided at the time of running the report. For example, to display the physical address of a certain customer, the data might include building number, street name, building sub-unit number, city name, state/province name, postal code, and country name, e.g., "123 Fake St Apt 4, Boulder, CO 80302, USA", which combines seven fields. However, the customers data table should not use one field to store that concatenated string; rather, the concatenation of the seven fields should happen upon running the report. The reason for such principles is that without them, the entry and updating of large volumes of data becomes error-prone and labor-intensive. Separately entering the city, state, ZIP code, and nation allows data-entry validation (such as detecting an invalid state abbreviation). Then those separate items can be used for sorting or indexing the records, such as all with "Boulder" as the city name.

===Recreational mathematics===
In [[recreational mathematics]], many problems concern the properties of numbers under concatenation of their numerals in some [[radix|base]].  Examples include [[home prime]]s (primes obtained by repeatedly factoring the increasing concatenation of prime factors of a given number), [[Smarandache–Wellin number]]s (the concatenations of the first [[prime number]]s), and the [[Champernowne constant|Champernowne]] and [[Copeland–Erdős constant]]s (the real numbers formed by the decimal representations of the [[positive integers]] and the prime numbers, respectively).

'''Diarmuid Johnson''' (1965 -) is a Welsh-Irish writer. He was born in Cardiff (Wales), brought up in Galway (Ireland), and holds BA, MA and PhD degrees in Celtic Studies. He has published poetry and prose in [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[English language|English]]. 

Johnson's literary activity extends to the field of translation, and he has authored or co-authored five works of Welsh literature in translation, two in Irish, one in English, one in French, and one in Romanian. He has also translated poetry from Romanian into English. 

Since 2004 Johnson has published a book a year on average. These include, most recently, 'Conaire Mór - Seacht nDoras na Cinniúna' (2017), a retelling of the Old Irish epic 'Togail Bruidne Da Derga', being one of a planned series with Leabhar Breac; 'Pen and Plough - 20th Century Poets and Bards of Ceredigion (Carreg Gwalch, 2016); 'Rún na mBradán - Dánta Gaeilge 2005-2015 (Coiscéim, 2016). 

From 1989 to 1996, Diarmuid Johnson lectured in Celtic Studies in [[Britanny]], [[Germany]] and Ireland. From 1996 until 2000, he worked as a journalist, scriptwriter and translator in [[Conamara]]. He was editor of ''Cuisle'', a monthly journal in Irish, between 1999 and 2000, and was editor of the trilingual online literary journal ''Transcript'' from 2002-2004. He worked at the Mercator Centre for Minority Languages at The University of Aberystwyth from 2002-2006. The years 2007-2013 he spent lecturing in Poland and Germany. In 2014, he was bard in residence with Menter Rhos-y-Gilwen in Pembrokeshire, Wales. He now works as a freelance writer and musician, contributes to [[Raidió na Gaeltachta]] and teaches Irish in Ireland in the summer. He has two daughters, is married, and divides his time between Ireland, Wales, and Brittany. He also has close ties with Germany, principally in the Rheinland area, where he has been performing and teaching since 2011.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.diarmuidjohnson.net|title=Diarmuid Johnston|website= Diarmuid Johnson – Music - Poetry - Images|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.transcript-review.org/en/issue/transcript-910-gaelic/dual-idioms/diarmuid-johnson|title= Transcript: Dual Idioms – Diarmuid Johnson|website= Transcript|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digo''' (''Chidigo'') is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language spoken primarily along the East African coast between [[Mombasa]] and [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] by the [[Digo people]] of [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]]. The ethnic Digo population has been estimated at around 360,000 (Mwalonya et al. 2004), the majority of whom are presumably speakers of the language. All adult speakers of Digo are bilingual in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], East Africa's [[lingua franca]]. The two languages are closely related, and Digo also has much vocabulary borrowed from neighbouring Swahili dialects.

== Classification ==
The classification and sub-classification of Digo provides a good example of the difficulty sometimes faced by linguists in differentiating [[languages]] and [[dialects]]. Most contemporary authorities follow Nurse and Hinnebusch (1993) in classifying Digo as a dialect of [[Mijikenda language|Mijikenda]], one of the constituent languages of the [[Sabaki languages|Sabaki]] group of [[Northeast Coast Bantu languages|Northeast Coast Bantu]]. The Mijikenda dialects are indeed mutually intelligible, though they are conventionally treated as separate languages. Digo is a member of the southern Mijikenda sub-group, and is most closely related to its neighbours [[Duruma language|Duruma]] and [[Rabai language|Rabai]]. It is, however, felt by speakers to be sufficiently different from other Mijikenda dialects to deserve its own [[orthography]] and literature.

== Dialects ==
Digo speakers recognise in turn a number of named varieties or dialects of their language. These are:
* Chinondo (Northern Digo), spoken along the south Kenya coast between Likoni (south Mombasa) and Msambweni (Hinnebusch 1973);
* Ungu (or Lungu, Southern Digo), spoken on the coastal strip south of Msambweni and across the border into northern Tanzania (Hinnebusch 1973);
* Ts’imba, spoken in the Shimba Hills of Kenya between Vuga in the east and Ng’onzini in the west (Walsh 2006); and
* Tsw’aka (or Chw’aka), spoken in and around the village of the same name on the [[Shimoni]] Peninsula of Kenya (Möhlig 1992, Nurse &amp; Walsh 1992).
Tsw’aka was once thought to have been a local variety of the Vumba dialect of Swahili, but is now considered to be a variety of Digo in the process of shifting to Vumba. Some assimilated [[Segeju]] and [[Degere]] are also said to speak their own separate varieties of Digo, presumably as a consequence of [[language shift]] (Nurse &amp; Walsh 1992).

== Orthography and literature ==
Digo speakers usually write their language using an alphabet based on the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] used for [[Swahili language|Swahili]], with additional combinations of letters representing some of the sounds that are distinctive to Digo (e.g. 'ph' for the [[voiced bilabial fricative]] or [[voiced bilabial approximant|approximant]]). This has been developed further by the Digo Language and Literacy Project of [[Bible Translation and Literacy (East Africa)]]. The project has produced basic literacy materials (listed in the [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=dig ''Ethnologue'']) and published a ''Digo-English-Swahili Dictionary'' using the new orthography (Mwalonya et al. 2004) as well as a linguistic description in ''A Grammar of Digo'' (Nicolle 2013). The Digo New Testament was finished in 2007. All of these materials are based on the Northern Digo dialect spoken in Kenya.

One hundred Digo proverbs have been collected and published by Margaret Wambere Ireri, with translations into Swahili, English, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Wambere Ireri. 2016.

[[File:Luise Kritzelzeichnung.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Doodle by [[Luise von Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], Queen of Prussia, c. 1795]]
A '''doodle''' is a [[drawing]] made while a person's attention is otherwise occupied. Doodles are simple drawings that can have concrete representational meaning or may just be composed of random and [[abstract art|abstract]] lines, generally without ever lifting the drawing device from the paper, in which case it is usually called a "scribble".

Doodling and scribbling are most often associated with young children and [[toddler]]s, because their lack of [[hand–eye coordination]] and lower mental development often make it very difficult for any young child to keep their [[coloring book|coloring]] attempts within the line art of the subject. Despite this, it is not uncommon to see such behaviour with adults, in which case it is generally done jovially, out of boredom.

Typical examples of doodling are found in school notebooks, often in the margins, drawn by students [[daydreaming]] or losing interest during class.&lt;ref name="Archey2013" /&gt; Other common examples of doodling are produced during long [[telephone]] conversations if a pen and paper are available.

Popular kinds of doodles include cartoon versions of teachers or companions in a school, famous TV or comic characters, invented fictional beings, landscapes, geometric shapes, patterns, textures, or phallic scenes.

==Etymology==
The word ''doodle'' first appeared in the early 17th century to mean a fool or simpleton.&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt; It  may derive from the German ''Dudeltopf'' or ''Dudeldop'', meaning simpleton or noodle (literally "nightcap").&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt; It is the origin of the early eighteenth century verb ''to doodle'', meaning "to swindle or to make a fool of". The modern meaning emerged in the 1930s either from this meaning or from the verb "to dawdle", which since the seventeenth century has had the meaning of wasting time or being lazy.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In the 1936 film ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'', in the final courtroom scene, the main character, addressing the judge, introduces the word 'doodler' – which the judge has not heard before – as "a name we made up back home to describe a person who makes foolish designs on paper when they're thinking."  This is clearly not a word in common usage at that time, and the inference is that it is an invented word that no one outside the character's fictional home town of Mandrake Falls would be expected to know.  Perhaps the word 'doodle', used here in its modern sense of 'an absent-minded design on paper', was not entirely new and was not actually invented by the scriptwriter, Robert Riskin, but it seems likely that at the very least this film greatly assisted the word into common usage.&lt;ref name="Etymonline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riskin1997" /&gt;

The meaning "fool, simpleton" is intended in the song title "[[Yankee Doodle]]", originally sung by British colonial troops prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Effects on memory==
According to a study published in the scientific journal ''Applied Cognitive Psychology'', doodling can aid a person's memory by expending just enough energy to keep one from daydreaming, which demands a lot of the brain's processing power, as well as from not paying attention. Thus, it acts as a mediator between the spectrum of thinking too much or thinking too little and helps focus on the current situation. The study was done by Professor Jackie Andrade, of the School of Psychology at the [[University of Plymouth]], who reported that doodlers in her experiment recalled 7.5 pieces of information (out of 16 total) on average, 29% more than the average of 5.8 recalled by the control group made of non-doodlers.&lt;ref name="Andrade2010" /&gt;

==Notable doodlers==
[[File:Pushkin doodle.jpg|thumb|A typical page from Pushkin's manuscript]]
[[Alexander Pushkin]]'s notebooks are celebrated for their superabundance of marginal doodles, which include sketches of friends' profiles, hands, and feet. These notebooks are regarded as a work of art in their own right. Full editions of Pushkin's doodles have been undertaken on several occasions.&lt;ref name="feb-web" /&gt; Some of Pushkin's doodles were animated by [[Andrei Khrzhanovsky]] and [[Yuriy Norshteyn]] in the 1987 film ''My Favorite Time''.&lt;ref name="Sandler2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bethea2013" /&gt;

Nobel laureate (in literature, 1913) poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] made huge number of doodles in his manuscript.&lt;ref name="Banerjee2011" /&gt; Poet and physician [[John Keats]] doodled in the margins of his medical notes; other literary doodlers have included [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Sylvia Plath]].&lt;ref name="Flavorwire" /&gt;  Mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]] developed the [[Ulam spiral]] for visualization of [[prime numbers]] while doodling during a boring presentation at a mathematics conference.{{sfn|Gardner|1964|p=122}} Many American Presidents, including [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Bill Clinton]], have been known to doodle during meetings.&lt;ref name="Atlantic" /&gt;

Some doodles and drawings can be found in notebooks of [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6368">'''Faubourg''' ({{IPA-fr|fo.buːʁ|pron}}) is an ancient [[French language|French]] term approximating "[[suburb]]" (now generally termed ''[[banlieue]]''). The earliest form is ''Forsbourg'', derived from [[Latin]] ''foris'', 'out of', and [[Vulgar Latin]] (originally Germanic) ''burgum'', 'town' or 'fortress'.  Traditionally, this name was given to an agglomeration forming around a throughway leading outwards from a city gate, and usually took the name of the same thoroughfare within the city.  As cities were often located atop hills (for defensive purposes), their outlying communities were frequently lower down.  Many faubourgs were located below their towns, and the term "suburbs" is derived from this tendency (''sub'' = below; ''urbs urbis'' = city).

Faubourgs are often considered the predecessor of European suburbs, into which they evolved generally in the 1950s and 1960s. Although early suburbs still conserved some characteristics related to faubourgs (such as the back alleys with doors, little break margins for houses, etc.), later suburbs underwent major changes in their construction, primarily in terms of residential density.

Beside many French cities, the places faubourgs can still be found outside Europe include the province of [[Quebec]] in Canada and the city of [[New Orleans]] in the [[United States]]. The cities of Quebec and Montreal contain examples, although Montreal has far greater divergences in terms of "banlieue," which lead to similarities of many [[Ontario|Ontarian]] and [[United States|America]]n suburbs.

==Paris==
Faubourgs were prominent around [[Paris]] since the 16th century. At that time, Paris was surrounded by a [[city wall]]. But even outside the [[Louis XIII wall]] there were urbanised areas, and those were called faubourgs. In 1701, these faubourgs were annexed to the city, and at about the same time, the wall was demolished, and where it once stood, there is now the chain of [[Boulevards of Paris#''Grand Boulevards''|Great Boulevards]] that leads from [[Place de la Bastille]] via [[Place de la République]] and [[Place de la Madeleine]] to [[Place de la Concorde]].  The border of the city was transferred a few kilometers outwards, and the new borderline, which was in force until 1860, is now marked by the outer circle of boulevards passing through [[Place Charles de Gaulle]] in West and [[Place de la Nation]] in East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://paris-atlas-historique.fr/37.html |  title= Les quartiers de Paris | website = Atlas Historique de Paris | language = French | publisher = | access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, the border of the city was once more transferred a few kilometers outwards to where it still is.  The Haussmannian Paris erased many traces of ancient faubourgs and the term banlieue was then coined.

Many Parisian streets have retained their ancient denomination in spite of city growth; today it is still possible to discern pre-1701 delimitations in Paris by marking the point where a thoroughfare's name changes from ''rue'' to ''rue du faubourg''. For instance, the [[rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis]] used to be located outside of the city wall and was an extension of the [[Rue Saint-Denis (Paris)|rue Saint-Denis]] within the walls. The [[rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré]] came about in a similar manner.

== New Orleans ==
The term was also used in the early expansion of [[New Orleans]] beyond the original city plan, when French was still a common language in the colonial city, even though in terms of characteristics, real faubourgs never existed in the city.  [[Faubourg Tremé]] and [[Faubourg Marigny]], two of the oldest neighborhoods outside of the [[French Quarter]], are persistent examples. Another early example was Faubourg Ste. Marie, originally (late 18th century) a residential area, which was overtaken by commerce, developing into the modern [[New Orleans Central Business District|Central Business District]].&lt;ref&gt;Campanella, Richard. ''Time and Place in New Orleans: Past Geographies in the Present Day''. Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican Publishing Company, 2002. {{ISBN|1-56554-991-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Montreal ==
[[Greater Montreal]] no longer has any actual ''faubourgs'' on [[island of Montreal|the main island]], as the suburb now refers to the [[North Shore (Laval)|North]] and [[South Shore (Montreal)|South Shore]]s. However, place names such as ''le Faubourg St-Laurent'' are still occasionally used to refer to the sections of [[Ville-Marie (borough)|Ville-Marie]].&lt;ref&gt;Ville de Montréal, [http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=87,1425295&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Le Quartier latin et le Faubourg Saint-Laurent]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/arrfm/Territoires/index.html Association des résidants et des résidantes des Faubourgs de Montréal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the term ''des faubourgs de Montréal'' ("the Montreal suburbs") is preserved in some place names in the [[City of Montreal|city proper]], such as the annexes (branches) of the ''[[vocational school|École des Métiers]] des Faubourgs-de-Montréal''. There was also a ''[[credit union|Caisse]] des Faubourgs de Montréal'' in [[Gay Village, Montreal|The Village]], which in 2003 was closed down.&lt;ref&gt;Mouvement des caisses Desjardins, [http://www.desjardins.com/en/votre_caisse/accueil.jsp?transit=81530008 Caisse Desjardins du Quartier-Latin de Montréal]. The Caisse Desjardins des Faubourgs de Montréal was at 1662 [[Saint Catherine Street]] East, and its operations were taken over by the Caisse du [[Quartier Latin (Montreal)|Quartier-Latin]] as of 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Québec City ==
The term ''faubourg'' is still alive in [[Quebec City]], where it is mostly used to designate the [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste, Quebec City|Saint-Jean-Baptiste neighbourhood]], often called ''Faubourg Saint-Jean-Baptiste'' or even ''le faubourg'' by its inhabitants. The term also applies to the [[Saint-Roch, Quebec City|Saint-Roch]] and Saint-Sauveur areas, and the three neighbourhoods are comprised in the municipal district of ''les Faubourgs''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/docs/cartes_districts/carte_district_arr1_04.pdf Ville de Québec]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flex space''' is a term used for lightly [[zoning|zoned]] [[buildings]]. It is mainly used when referring to [[Industry|industrial]] or [[office]] space.

==History==
Flex space evolved from light industrial warehouses being converted to office space. Businesses that generally occupy these are new [[dotcoms]], mechanic shops, and companies that contract [[plumbing]], [[Pest (organism)|pest]], [[electrical]], and sometimes [[local church|churches]] and related services.

Companies have discovered that on any given work day, a large percentage of their cubes are unoccupied—in some cases, up to 50%. Employees travel for work, take vacation, or are working from home in greater numbers than ever before. To avoid having to lease or buy more office space, flex space allows a company to have a higher occupancy of cube space and less wasted work areas.

At the beginning of the work day, an employee shows up at work. Cubes are mostly configured in the same way, making them all the same. The employee chooses a cube where she would like to sit, and that is her cube for the day. At the end of the day, she packs up her belongings, either taking them all home with her or storing them in a locker space. This leaves the cube the same way it was when he came in, and leaves it free and open for someone to use the following day.
A large concern with employees in a flex space environment is cleanliness. It is important in a flex space environment to have a strong cleaning staff.

Flex space describes mechanic shops as well.  The [https://sites.google.com/site/dakmfgwilliston/ Jim Bridger Building] of Williston, North Dakota, USA is an example of a modern flex space mechanic shop.

The Jim Bridger Building is designed to flex its use depending on the needs of the oilfield and agricultural industries of Western North Dakota.  Each vertical building panel has pneumatic, water, electrical, fiber optic, and hanging plates embedded in each panel.  This makes the use of the building flexible.  Tenants can grow their business space use, or trim their space use, without sacrificing  building services.  The building has heavy reinforced flooring, which with the panel plates and overhead cranes, makes the entire building into one big workbench.

'''''Fundamental French''''' (français fondamental) is a list of words and [[grammar| grammatical concepts]] created in beginning of the 1950s for teaching foreigners and people part of l'Union française so that France could improve the spread of the French language. A series of investigations in the 1950s and '60s showed that a small number of words are used the same way orally and in writing in all circumstances; thus a limited number of grammatical rules were necessary for a functional language.

==Origins==
''Français fondamental'' was developed by the ''Centre d'Etude du Français Élémentaire'', which was renamed to the ''Centre de Recherche et d'Etude pour la Diffusion du Français'' (CREDIF) in 1959. It was headed by Georges Gougenheim, a linguist.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, H. H. ''Fundamental Concepts of Language Teaching: Historical and Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Applied Linguistic Research''. [[Oxford University Press]]. 24 March 1983. [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6T3eo5ltFAC&amp;pg=RA15-PA55&amp;lpg=RA15-PA55&amp;dq=%22Fran%C3%A7ais+fondamental%22+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C9zR3l6WqK&amp;sig=B_DFKqMfmX0wJsZxmyCEiNa0M6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oxl_UJHJDYm88wTbtoCgAg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fran%C3%A7ais%20fondamental%22%20language&amp;f=false p. 55]. Retrieved from Google Books on October 17, 2012. {{ISBN|0194370658}}, 9780194370653.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Education (France)|Ministry of Education of France]] sanctioned and promoted it as a method of learning French. The use of ''Français fondamental'' was common in French textbooks, and especially prevalent in audiovisual learning methods used in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Decoo63&gt;Decoo, Wilfried. ''Systemization in Language Learning Models''. [[Taylor &amp; Francis US]], January 1, 2009. [https://books.google.com/books?id=O-PEsGfjHfcC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22Fundamental+french%22+%22Fran%C3%A7ais+fondamental%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jXxVw2n3U0&amp;sig=0gE1wZeLL222aja9aG6sefTWEgI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vhh_UL3aIYSg8gSTk4CwDw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fundamental%20french%22%20%22Fran%C3%A7ais%20fondamental%22&amp;f=false p. 63]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on 17 October 2012. {{ISBN|0415361931}}, 9780415361934&lt;/ref&gt;

Gougenheim, Réné Michea, Paul Rivenc, and Aurélien Sauvageot served as researchers for the project. There are 1,475 words in the "first degree" and 1,609 words in the "second degree."&lt;ref name=Decoo63/&gt;

==Characteristics==

The core words for usage consist of around 270 grammatical words, 380 [[noun|nouns]], 200 [[verb|verbs]], 100 [[adjective|adjectives]], and 50 words for various other uses, making up a total of one thousand words. There is a second group of words which are common to all French speakers, who can use spontaneously use around 1,500 words when needed in particular circumstances.

''L'[[Academie francaise]]'' prefers to distinguish "fundamental french" and "elementary french" as it says in its page "Langue francaise - Questions courantes" (The French Language - Common Questions) in the rubric ''Nombre de mots de la langue francaise'' (number of words in the french language): "Based on frequency surveys, 'Fundamental French' and 'Elementary French' include just over 1000 to 3000 entrees respectively.

== Role and Influence ==

Fundamental French certainly had an influence, particularly in teaching the language to foreigners. But it was rejected in 1970 with the renewal of language teaching, without being replaced by a new tool. A seminar organised at ''l'École normale supérieure lettres et sciences humaines de Lyon'' in December 2005 tried to take stock of the developments that had occurred since its creation.

In a similar spirit but without the apparent affiliation, [[Radio France Internationale]] (RFI) released a 10 minute Journal in easy French with a restrained and simple vocabulary (300 words) that gave the context of the events once a day. This step is analogous to that of the Voice of America, who released a program in 1959 in Special English, a form of basic English with a vocabulary restrained to 1500 words.

[[File:Google Bomb Miserable Failure.png|thumb|300px|right|An example of Google bombing in 2006 that caused the search query "miserable failure" to be associated with [[George W. Bush]] and [[Michael Moore]].]]
The terms '''Google bomb''' and '''Googlewashing''' refer to the practice of causing a [[website]] to rank highly in [[web search engine]] results for irrelevant, unrelated or off-topic search terms by linking heavily. In contrast, [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) is the practice of improving the [[search engine]] listings of web pages for ''relevant'' search terms.

Google-bombing is done for either business, political, or comedic purposes (or some combination thereof).&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom Jr.|last=Zeller|title=A New Campaign Tactic: Manipulating Google Data|work=[[The New York Times]] (Late Edition (East Coast))|date=October 26, 2006|page=A.20|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/26/us/politics/26googlebomb.html}} (Note: payment required, weblink goes to abstract.)&lt;!-- replace this with a free source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Google's [[PageRank|search-rank algorithm]] ranks pages higher for a particular search phrase if enough other pages linked to it use similar [[anchor text]]. By January 2007, however, Google tweaked its search algorithm to counter popular Google bombs such as "miserable failure" leading to [[George W. Bush]] and [[Michael Moore]]; now, search results list pages about the Google bomb itself.&lt;ref name="googlebomb halt"/&gt; Since no later than 21 June 2015, the first result in a Google search for "miserable failure" is the Wikipedia article defining ''Google bomb''.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150621133110/https://www.google.com/search?q=miserable+failure&amp;gws_rd=ssl&lt;/ref&gt; Used both as a [[verb]] and a [[noun]], "Google bombing" was introduced to the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050516-184202|title=Google and Google Bombing Now Included New Oxford American Dictionary|work=Search Engine Watch|first=Gary|last=Price|date=May 16, 2005|accessdate=January 29, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127123936/http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050516-184202|archivedate=January 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;!--Search Engine Watch article] on addition of "Google Bomb" to dictionary--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Google bombing is related to [[spamdexing]], the practice of deliberately modifying [[HTML]] to increase the chance of a website being placed close to the beginning of search engine results, or to influence the category to which the page is assigned in a misleading or dishonest manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Zoltán | last=Gyöngyi | authorlink1=Zoltán Gyöngyi | first2=Hector | last2=Garcia-Molina | contribution=Web spam taxonomy | contribution-url=http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/2005/gyongyi.pdf | title=Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web (AIRWeb), 2005 in The 14th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2005) May 10, (Tue)-14 (Sat), 2005, Nippon Convention Center (Makuhari Messe), Chiba, Japan. | year=2005 | publisher=ACM Press | place=New York, NY | isbn=1-59593-046-9 | authorlink2=Hector Garcia-Molina }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Googlewashing'' was coined by [[Andrew Orlowski]] in 2003 to describe the use of [[media manipulation]] to change the perception of a term, or push out competition from [[search engine results page]]s (SERPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Orlowski|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Orlowski|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/03/antiwar_slogan_coined_repurposed/|title=Anti-war slogan coined, repurposed and Googlewashed ... in 42 days.|date=April 3, 2003|work=The Register|accessdate=January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AdamsMcCrindle2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew A.

==History==
Google bombs date back as far as 1999, when a search for "more [[evil]] than [[Satan]] himself" resulted in the [[Microsoft]] homepage as the top result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clickz.com/google-bombs-arent-so-scary/61942/|accessdate=December 8, 2017|title=Google Bombs Aren't So Scary|first=Danny|last=Sullivan|date=March 18, 2002|work=ClickZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/incredible-google-bombs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2000 the first Google bomb with a verifiable creator was created by ''Hugedisk Men's Magazine'', a now-defunct online humor magazine, when it linked the text "dumb motherfucker" to a site selling [[George W. Bush]]-related merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,41401,00.html |last=Manjoo |first=Fahrad |title=Google Link is Bush League |date=January 25, 2001 |work=Wired News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010405062025/http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0%2C1282%2C41401%2C00.html |archivedate=April 5, 2001 |accessdate=January 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugedisk had also unsuccessfully attempted to Google bomb an equally derogatory term to bring up an [[Al Gore]]-related site. After a fair amount of publicity the George W. Bush-related merchandise site retained lawyers and sent a [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] letter to ''Hugedisk'', thereby ending the Google bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/01/earlier_today_m.html|title=Remembering the First Google Bomb|first=Michael|last=Calore|author2=Scott Gilbertson|date=January 26, 2001|work=Wired News|accessdate=January 27, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070225081940/http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/01/earlier_today_m.html |archivedate = February 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Mathes is credited with coining the term "Google bombing" when he mentioned it in an April 6, 2001 article in the online magazine ''uber.nu''. In the article Mathes details his connection of the search term "talentless hack" to the website of his friend Andy Pressman by recruiting fellow webloggers to link to his friend's page with the desired term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Adam|last=Mathes|url=http://uber.nu/2001/04/06/|title=Filler Friday: Google Bombing|date=April 6, 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050715083840/http://uber.nu/2001/04/06/|archivedate=July 15, 2005|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts forecast that the practice of Google Bombing is over, as changes to Google's algorithm over the years have minimised the effect of the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=SEO|last=Works|url=https://www.seoworks.co.uk/end-of-the-googlebomb/|title=The end of the GoogleBomb|date=January 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses as tactical media==
The Google Bomb has been used for [[tactical media]] as a way of performing a "hit-and-run" media attack on popular topics. Such attacks include Anthony Cox's attack in 2003. He created a parody of the "404 – page not found" browser error message in response to the war in Iraq. The page looked like the error page but was titled "These Weapons of Mass Destruction cannot be displayed". This website could be found as one of the top hits on Google after the start of the war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mushon.com/2010/03/23/interface-as-a-conflict-of-ideologies/|title=Interface as a Conflict of Ideologies|date=April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in an attempt to detract attention from the far-right group [[English Defence League]] (EDL), a parody group has been made known as "[[English Disco Lovers]]", with the expressed purpose of Google bombing the acronym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edl.me|title=EDL - English Disco Lovers NOT English Defence League - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative meanings==
The Google bomb is often misunderstood by those in the media and publishing industry who do not retain technical knowledge of Google's ranking factors. For example, talk radio host [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] has often conducted what he calls "Google bombs" by dispatching instructions to his radio/Internet listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schoff |first=Hans |url=http://hansschoff.com/mlm/google-bomb-mastering-internet-marketing-strategies |title=How to Google Bomb - Mastering Internet Marketing Strategies &amp;#124; Hans Schoff's Official Home Based Income Blog |publisher=Hansschoff.com |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512030112/http://hansschoff.com/mlm/google-bomb-mastering-internet-marketing-strategies |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scuttledd.com/2011/06/the-new-activism-alex-jones-and-the-next-phase-of-the-infowar/&lt;/ref&gt; In this context the term is used to describe a rapid and massive influx of keyword searches for a particular phrase. The keyword surge gives the impression that the related content has suddenly become popular. The strategy behind this type of Google bombing is to attract attention from the larger mainstream media and influence them to publish content related to the keyword.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Google bowling==
By studying what types of ranking manipulations a search engine is using, a company can provoke a search engine into ''lowering'' the ranking of a competitor's website. This practice, known as '''Google bowling''', is often done by purchasing Google bombing services (or other [[search engine optimization|SEO]] techniques) not for one's own website, but rather for that of a competitor. The attacker provokes the search company into punishing the "offending" competitor by displaying their page further down in the search results.&lt;ref name="google-bowling"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/06/28/negative-search-google-tech-ebiz-cx_ag_0628seo.html|title=The Saboteurs Of Search|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|work=Forbes|date=June 28, 2007|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Pedone |url=http://www.webpronews.com/expertarticles/2005/10/27/google-bowling-how-competitors-can-sabotage-you-what-google-should-do-about-it |title=Google Bowling: How Competitors Can Sabotage You; What Google Should Do About It |publisher=Webpronews.com |date=October 27, 2005 |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201020606/http://www.webpronews.com/expertarticles/2005/10/27/google-bowling-how-competitors-can-sabotage-you-what-google-should-do-about-it |archivedate=December 1, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For victims of Google bowling, it may be difficult to appeal the ranking decrease because Google avoids explaining penalties, preferring not to "educate" real offenders. If the situation is clear-cut, however, Google could lift the penalty after submitting a request for reconsideration. Furthermore, after the [[Google Penguin]] update, Google search rankings now take Google bowling into account and according to various sources, very rarely will a website be penalized due to low-quality "farm" backlinks.

==Other search engines==
Other search engines use similar techniques to rank results, so [[Yahoo!]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], and [[Ask.com]] are also affected by Google bombs. A search for "[[miserable failure]]" or "failure" on September 29, 2006, brought up the official George W. Bush biography number one on Google, Yahoo!, and MSN and number two on Ask.com. On June 2, 2005, Tooter reported that George Bush was ranked first for the keyword "miserable", "failure", and "miserable failure" in both Google and Yahoo!; Google has since addressed this and disarmed the George Bush Google bomb and many others.

The [[BBC]], reporting on Google bombs in 2002, used the headline "Google Hit By Link Bombers",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1868395.stm|title=Google Hit By Link Bombers|publisher=BBC |date=March 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging to some degree the idea of "link bombing". In 2004, [[Search Engine Watch]] suggested that the term be "link bombing" because of its application beyond Google, and continues to use that [[technical term|term]] as it is considered more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yooter.com/blog/index.php?entry=entry050602-180255 |title=Yooter SEO blog |publisher=Yooter.com |accessdate=July 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513202317/http://www.yooter.com/blog/index.php?entry=entry050602-180255 |archivedate=May 13, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 2007, Google changed its indexing structure&lt;ref name="googlebomb halt"/&gt; so that Google bombs such as "miserable failure" would "typically return commentary, discussions, and articles" about the tactic itself.&lt;ref name="googlebomb halt"/&gt; Google announced the changes on its official blog.

==Motivations==

===Competitions===
In May 2004, the websites Dark Blue and SearchGuild teamed up to create what they termed the "SEO Challenge" to Google bomb the phrase "[[nigritude ultramarine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karch|first=Marziah|title=Google Bombs Explained|url=http://google.about.com/od/socialtoolsfromgoogle/a/googlebombatcl.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contest sparked controversy around the Internet, as some groups worried that [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) companies would abuse the techniques used in the competition to alter queries more relevant to the average user. This fear was offset by the belief that [[Google]] would alter their algorithm based on the methods used by the Google bombers.

In September 2004, another [[SEO contest]] was created. This time, the objective was to get the top result for the phrase "[[seraphim proudleduck]]". A large sum of money was offered to the winner, but the competition turned out to be a hoax.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In March 2005's issue of [[.net (magazine)|''.net'' magazine]], a contest was created among five professional web developers to make their site the number-one site for the made-up phrase "crystalline incandescence".

===Political activism===
{{See also|Political Google bombs in the 2004 U.S. Presidential election}}
Some of the most famous Google bombs are also expressions of political opinions (e.g. "liar" leading to [[Tony Blair]] or "miserable failure" leading to the White House's biography of George W. Bush):

* In 2003, Steven Lerner, creator of [[Albino Blacksheep]], created a [[parody]] webpage titled "French Military Victories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/text/victories.html |title=french military victories |publisher=Albinoblacksheep.com |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; When typed into Google, the first result (or the "I'm Feeling Lucky" result) led to a webpage resembling a Google error message, reading, "Your search – French military victories – did not match any documents. Did you mean French military ''defeats''?" The page received over 50,000 hits within 18 hours of its release. Links near the top of the page led to a simplified list of [[Military history of France|French military history]]. The only war listed as a win for the French was the French Revolution, in which they fought themselves. As of May 2, 2011, the page is no longer listed in Google's first few results for "French military victories", but several links on the list go to sites recounting the joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard J., Jr.|last=Dalton|title=Internet Parody Hands French Military a Defeat|page=A.27|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/305039401.html?dids=305039401:305039401&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT|work=Newsday|date=March 13, 2003|accessdate=February 4, 2007}} (payment required, link goes to abstract)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003, columnist [[Dan Savage]] began his [[campaign for the neologism "santorum"|campaign to define the word "santorum"]] after former U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum]] made several [[Santorum controversy regarding homosexuality|controversial statements]] regarding homosexuality. A search for "santorum" led to the top result being a website defining it as being related to [[anal sex]]. One search engine expert has argued that this campaign does not qualify as a Google bomb, arguing that it is instead a successful new definition for a word explained by a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Evan |last=McMorris-Santoro |url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/with-his-campaign-lagging-rick-santorum-turns-once-again-to-dan-savage |title=With His Campaign Lagging, Rick Santorum Turns Once Again To Dan Savage |publisher=Talking Points Memo |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[search engine optimization]])
* In 2004, Jewish writer and activist [[Daniel Sieradski]] urged visitors to his blog to link to the [[Jew|Wikipedia article for "Jew"]] in response to findings, first publicized by Steven Weinstock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Becker |first=David |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038-5186012.html |title=Google caught in anti-Semitism flap |publisher=News.cnet.com |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Brandon |url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/05/63380 |title=Dropping the Bomb on Google |publisher=Wired.com |accessdate=July 9, 2010 |date=May 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a search for "Jew" returned the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] website [[Jew Watch]] at the top of the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038_3-5186012.html |title=Google caught in anti-Semitism flap - CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was successful in displacing the site from the top result.

* Also, in 2004, a Google bomb involving searching "ladrones" (Spanish for thieves) on Google linked the [[SGAE]] website.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* In France, groups opposing the [[DADVSI]] copyright bill, proposed by minister [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]], mounted a Google bombing campaign linking ''ministre blanchisseur'' ("laundering minister") to an article on Donnedieu de Vabres' conviction for [[money laundering]]. The campaign was so efficient that {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, merely searching for ''ministre'' ("minister") or ''blanchisseur'' ("launderer") brings up a news report of his conviction as one of the first results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://palpitt.free.fr/index.php?2005/12/20/16-google-bomb-a-la-francaise |title=Bombardement Google à la française - Palpitt - Metablog |publisher=Palpitt |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211005142/http://palpitt.free.fr/index.php?2005%2F12%2F20%2F16-google-bomb-a-la-francaise |archivedate=February 11, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2004, after the controversy that erupted in the [[Philippines]] over the allegations that President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] had cheated in the elections, the phrase "''pekeng pangulo''" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "fake president") was linked to her official website.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* In December 2004, the "''Yan Ang Pinay''" ("I am a Filipina") campaign&lt;ref&gt;[http://filipina.fil.net/ Yan Ang Filipina]&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged bloggers to self-identify as Filipina and link the word [[Filipina]] to target URLs such as the Filipina Women's Network (ffwn.org),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipinasoul.com/2007/02/resurrecting-the-image-of-a-true-filipina/ |title=Resurrecting the image of a true Filipina |publisher=Filipina Soul |date=2007-02-14 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to displace [[mail order bride|mail-order bride]] sites in search results.
* In 2004, ''kretyn'' ([[Polish language|Polish]] for ''moron'') and similar insults referring to stupidity were linked to websites of various Polish politicians including [[Andrzej Lepper]] and [[Roman Giertych]].
* In 2005 an Estonian blogger led a successful campaign to link the word ''masendav'' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]] for ''dismal'' or ''depressive'') to the homepage of [[Estonian Centre Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.postimees.ee/211005/online_uudised/180817.php|title=Google'i otsing seob sõnad "masendav" ja "Keskerakond"|date=October 21, 2005|work=[[Postimees]]|language=Estonian|accessdate=October 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118000752/http://www.postimees.ee/211005/online_uudised/180817.php|archivedate=January 18, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre Party's website still ranks first in the results for ''masendav'' {{As of|2011|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=masendav |title=Google |publisher=Google |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In January 2009, a successful Google bomb was performed against the site of the [[Bulgarian government]] by a loose group of bloggers and forum users. It was discovered that by mistake, the robots.txt on the government.bg forbade the crawling of the site by indexing machines which allowed for Google bombing. The group linked the search term "failure" ({{lang-bg|провал}})  to the government site. Within a couple of days, the first search result for "провал" was the Bulgarian government's site regardless of the search results language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rene Beekman |url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/2009/01/27/666229_google-search-results-link-bulgarian-government-with-failure-ruin-collapse |title=Sofia Echo coverage |publisher=Sofiaecho.com |date=February 25, 2009 |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Spamdexing}}
Some website operators have adapted Google bombing techniques to do "spamdexing". This includes, among other techniques, posting of links to a site in an [[Internet forum]] along with phrases the promoter hopes to associate with the site (see [[spam in blogs]]). Unlike conventional message board spam, the object is not to attract readers to the site directly, but to increase the site's ranking under those search terms. Promoters using this technique frequently target forums with low reader traffic, in hopes that it will fly under the moderators' radar. [[Wiki]]s in particular are often the target of this kind of page rank vandalism, as all of the pages are freely editable. This practice was also called "money bombing" by [[John Hiler]] circa 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/01/26/BUG3M4GVDS1.DTL|title=Google targeted by pranksters: Web site operators, bloggers skew results|date=January 26, 2004|accessdate=November 27, 2007|author=Kopytoff, Verne|work=San Francisco Chronicle }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The 100 Best Trends 2006: Emerging Developments You Can't Afford to Ignore|author1=Ochoa, George |author2=Corey, Melinda|page=213|year=2005|accessdate=November 27, 2007|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-59337-451-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=am-c2MR1ZA0C&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique is for the owner of an Internet [[domain name]] to set up the domain's [[Domain Name System|DNS]] entry so that all [[subdomain]]s are directed to the same server. The operator then sets up the server so that page requests generate a page full of desired Google search terms, each linking to a subdomain of the same site, with the same title as the subdomain in the requested [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]. Frequently the subdomain matches the linked phrase, with spaces replaced by [[underscore]]s or [[hyphen]]s. Since Google treats subdomains as distinct sites, the effect of many subdomains linking to each other is a boost to the [[PageRank]] of those subdomains and of any other site they link to.

On February 2, 2007, many have noticed changes in the Google algorithm that largely affects, among other things, Google bombs: only roughly 10% of the Google bombs worked as of February 15, 2007. This is largely due to Google refactoring its valuation of PageRank.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A quick word about Googlebombs|url = http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/01/quick-word-about-googlebombs.html|website = Official Google Webmaster Central Blog|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://answers.google.com/answers/main?cmd=threadview&amp;id=179922 |title=Google Answers: Google Inc., and the Google Bomb |publisher=Answers.google.com |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Protestantism}}

The '''International League of Christian Esperantists''' ([[Esperanto]]: ''Kristana Esperantista Ligo Internacia'', '''KELI''') is the association of [[protestant]] [[Esperantist]]s. It was founded in 1911, during the [[Universal Congress of Esperanto]] in [[Anvers]]. Its members from very diverse backgrounds, mostly protestant churches. KELI publishes a bimonthly magazine, ''Dia Regno'', which started to appear regularly in 1908, when the [[Germany|German]] [[Paul Hübner]] was sure that five people would subscribe. Now the magazine serves as a tool among members in 48 countries from diverse faiths, [[Adventism|Adventists]] to [[Quakers]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], etc., but also people of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

In the beginning, it was important to have basic literature. In 1912, the [[New Testament]] was published and then in 1926 the entire [[Bible]] with the [[Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof|Zamenhof]]'s [[Old Testament]] translation - not privately, but in the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]. That way, it is possible to continually have Esperanto Bibles in every Christian Bookstore throughout the entire world. Also, an edition having the [[deuterocanonical books]] (translated by Gerrit berveling of [[Netherlands]]) was published in 2003. In 1971, KELI had an official hymnal "Adoru Kantante" (Worship by Singing) with 262 songs (mostly classics), from many countries and languages, with four part harmony - a beautiful book, done professionally. Recently, conferences have used more modest looking song collections, "Tero kaj Chielo Kantu" (Earth and Heaven Sing) with 161 songs, since people preferred more modern music. ''Adoru'', an ecumenical worship book co-edited with the catholic association [[IKUE]], containing texts, prayers and hymnals appeared in June 2001.

After the war, KELI started to organize an annual conference with concerns about working out a program about work, study, entertainment, the conference country and local churches. More and more, because of good communication with IKUE, the Roman Catholic Esperanto-Union, the annual conferences happened together, for the first time in 1968 in Limburg/Lahn. They attracted between 90 and 200 people, many of which were IKUE or KELI members.

At Universal Congresses, IKUE and KELI try to have communion together if possible. Often, they are among the great amount of visited programs of the congress week.

From the start, KELI supported the actions for the blind by the Dutchman, Jacques Tuinder, known under the name ''Agado E3'', or now E-vid-ente. Now, its help focuses on Albania, but does not forget other aspects of misery for people with poor sight.

The task of KELI goes in two directions: to inform the Church and other Christian groups about Esperanto, and to inform the Esperanto community about Christianity.

{{Anthropology of kinship |terms}}
'''Iroquois kinship''' (also known as '''bifurcate merging''') is a [[Kinship and descent|kinship]] system named after the [[Haudenosaunee]] people that were previously known as ''Iroquois'' and whose kinship system was the first one described to use this particular type of system.  Identified by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in his 1871 work ''[[Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family]]'', the Iroquois system is one of the six major kinship systems ([[Eskimo kinship|Eskimo]], [[Hawaiian kinship|Hawaiian]], Iroquois, [[Crow kinship|Crow]], [[Omaha kinship|Omaha]], and [[Sudanese kinship|Sudanese]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Kinship system==
The system has both [[Classificatory kinship|classificatory]] and [[descriptive]] terms.  In addition to gender and generation, Iroquois kinship also distinguishes 'same-sex' and 'cross-sex' parental siblings: the brothers of Ego's (the subject from whose perspective the kinship is based) father, and the sisters of Ego's mother, are referred to by the same parental kinship terms used for Ego's Father and Mother. The sisters of Ego's father, and the brothers of Ego's mother, on the other hand, are referred to by non-parental kinship terms, commonly translated into English as "Aunt" and "Uncle".

The children of one's parents' same-sex siblings, i.e. [[parallel cousin]]s, are referred to by sibling kinship terms. The children of Aunts or Uncles, i.e. [[cross cousin]]s, are not considered siblings, and are referred to by kinship terms commonly translated into English as "cousin".  In some systems, the kinship terms applied to cross-cousins are the same as those applied to brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, due to preferential marriage practices (see below).
[[Image:Iriquois-kinship-chart.svg|center|660px|Egocentric genealogical diagram of the Iroquois kinship system.]]

==Marriage==
Ego (the subject from whose perspective the kinship is based) is encouraged to marry his [[cross cousin]]s but discouraged or prohibited from marrying his [[parallel cousin]]s.  In many societies with Iroquois kinship terminologies, the preferred marriage partners include not only first cousins (mother's brother's children and father's sister's children), but more remote relatives who are also classified as cross cousins by the logic of the kinship system.  Preferential cross-cousin marriage can be useful in reaffirming alliances between unilineal [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineages]] or [[clan]]s.

==Usage==
The term Iroquois comes from the six [[Iroquois]] tribes of northeastern North America. Another aspect of their kinship was that the six tribes all had [[matrilineal]] systems, in which children were born into the mother's [[clan]] and gained status through it. Women controlled some property, and hereditary leadership passed through the maternal line. A woman's eldest brother was more important as a mentor to her children than their father, who was always of a different clan.

Some groups in other countries also happen to be independently organized for kinship by the Iroquois system.  It is commonly found in [[Unilineality|unilineal descent]] groups.  These include:
#The [[Anishinaabe]] of North America, who include the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], [[Nipissing First Nation|Nipissing]], [[Mississauga]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Saulteaux]], [[Odawa people|Odawa]] and [[Potawatomi]] peoples.  Many of these people were traditional neighbors to the Iroquois, but they spoke languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family.

Other populations found to have the Iroquois system are
#Most of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking cultures of [[Eastern Africa|Eastern]] and [[Southern Africa|Southern]] [[sub-Saharan Africa]] &amp;mdash; see [[Sesotho kinship]] for an example.
#Many [[Melanesian]] societies.

===South India and Sri Lanka===
{{Citation needed|reason=Need citation|date=July 2017}}

Some communities in  [[South India]] use the kinship tradition described above. 



===Melanesia===
Many of the cultures of [[Vanuatu]] use this type of kinship system. In [[Bislama]] (Vanuatu pidgin), paternal uncles and maternal aunts are referred to as ''smol papa'' "small father" and ''smol mama'' "small mother" respectively.

'''K’iche’''' ({{IPA-myn|kʼiˈtʃeʔ|}}, also ''Qatzijob'al'' "our language" to its speakers),  or '''Quiché''' ({{IPAc-en|k|iː|ˈ|tʃ|eɪ}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;), is a [[Maya language]] of Guatemala, spoken by the [[K'iche' people]] of the central highlands. With over a million speakers (some 7% of Guatemala's population), K'iche' is the second-most widely spoken language in the country after Spanish. Most speakers of K'iche' languages also have at least a working knowledge of [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The Central dialect is the most commonly used in the media and education. The literacy rate is low, but K'iche' is increasingly taught in schools and used on radio. The most famous work in the [[Classical K'iche' language]] is the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'' (''Popol Wu'uj'' in modern spelling).

==Dialects==
Kaufman (1970) divides the K'iche' complex into the following five dialects, with the representative municipalities given as well (quoted in Par Sapón 2000:17).

The [[Nahualá]] dialect of K'iche' shows some differences from other K'iche' dialects. It preserves an ancient [[Proto-Mayan]] distinction between five long vowels (aa, ee, ii, oo, uu) and five short vowels (a, e, i, o, u). It is for that conservative linguistic feature that Guatemalan and foreign linguists have actively sought to have the language called K'ichee rather than K'iche' or Quiché.

==Phonology==
K'iche' has a rather conservative phonology. It has not developed many of the innovations found in neighboring languages, such as retroflex consonants or tone.

===Stress===
Stress is not phonemic. It occurs on the final syllable, and on every other syllable before the final in an [[iamb (poetry)|iambic]] pattern.

Unstressed vowels are frequently [[vowel reduction|reduced]] (to {{IPAblink|ɨ}} or {{IPAblink|ə}}) or elided altogether, often producing [[consonant cluster]]s even at the beginnings of words. For example, ''sib'alaj'' "very" may be pronounced {{IPA|[siɓlaχ]}}, and ''je na la' ''"thus" {{IPA|[χenðaʔ]}}.

===Vowels===
K'iche' dialects differ in their vowel systems.  Historically, K'iche' had a ten-vowel system: five short and five long.  Some dialects (for instance, Nahualá and Totonicapán) retain the ten-vowel system.  Others (for instance, Cantel) have reduced it to a six-vowel system with no length distinctions: short /a/ has become /ə/ in these dialects, and the other short vowels have merged with their long counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsen|first=Thomas|title=Manifestations of Ergativity in Quiché Grammar|year=1988|publisher=Ph.D. thesis|location=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different conventions for spelling the vowels have been proposed, including by the [[Proyecto Lingüístico Francisco Marroquín]], the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]] and the [[Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala]].  The table below shows the two vowel systems, and several of the spelling systems that have been proposed.

Vowels typically undergo [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] in [[wiktionary:Penultimate|penultimate]] [[syllables]], allowing for a wide array of complex onsets. [[Diphthongs]] are found in recent loanwords.

===Consonants===
K'iche' has both [[pulmonic consonant|pulmonic]] stops and affricates, '''p''' /p/, '''t''' /t/, '''tz''' /ts/, '''ch''' /tʃ/, '''k''' /k/, and '''q''' /q/, and [[glottalized]] counterparts '''b’''' /ɓ/, '''t’''' /t’/, '''tz’''' /ts’/, '''ch’''' /tʃ’/, '''k’''' /k’/, and '''q’''' /q’/. The glottalized /ɓ/ is a weak [[implosive]], while the other glottalized consonants are [[ejectives]]. The pulmonic stops and affricates are typically [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]].

In West Quiche, the approximants '''l''' /l/, '''r''' /ɻ/, '''y''' /j/, and '''w''' /w/ devoice and fricate to {{IPA|[ɬ], [ʂ], [ç], and [ʍ]}} word-finally and often before voiceless consonants. In some dialects,{{which|date=July 2015}} intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}} alternates between {{IPA|[l]}} and {{IPA|[ð]}}, a highly unusual sound change. The fricative {{IPA|[ð]}} is most common between the vowels ''o'' and ''a'' and between two ''o{{apostrophe}}''s, and occurs more often than not between two ''a{{apostrophe}}''s.

===Syllabic structure===

Complex onsets are very common in K'iche', partially due to the active process of penultimate syncope. Complex codas are rare, except when the first member of the complex coda is a phonemic [[glottal stop]], written with an apostrophe. The sonorants /m, n, l, r/ may be [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]].

==Orthography==
Historically, different [[orthography|orthographies]] have been used to transliterate the K'iche' languages. The classic orthography of Father Ximénez who wrote down the [[Popol Vuh]] is based on the Spanish orthography and has been replaced by a new standardized orthography defined by the ALMG ([[Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala]]). Ethnohistorian and Mayanist [[Dennis Tedlock]] uses his own transliteration system which is completely different from any of the established orthographies, but this system will not be given here.

|-
|(Tedlock's English translation)
|"This is the beginning of the ancient word, here in the place called Quiché." 
|}

==Morphology==
Like other [[Mayan languages]], K'iche' uses two sets of agreement markers—known to Mayanists as "Set A" and "Set B" markers—which can appear on both nouns and verbs. "Set A" markers are used on nouns to mark possessor agreement, and on verbs to agree with the transitive subject ([[ergative case]]). "Set B" markers are used on verbs to agree with the transitive object or the intransitive subject ([[absolutive case]]).

|}

===Pronouns===

K'iche' distinguishes six pronouns, classified by person and number. Gender and case are not marked on pronouns. Pronouns are often omitted, as subject and object agreement are obligatorily marked on the verb.

|}

===Verbs===

Verbs are highly morphologically complex, and can take numerous prefixes and suffixes serving both inflectional and derivational purposes.

The table below shows the inflectional template of a K'iche' verb.  Agreement follows an ergative/absolutive pattern.  Subjects of transitive verbs are indexed using Set A markers.  Intransitive subjects and transitive objects are indexed using Set B markers.  Aspect and mood are also indicated, as is [[Andative and venitive|movement]]: the prefix '''ul-''' in the movement slot indicates movement towards the speaker, while the prefix '''e-''' (or '''b'e-''' in some varieties) indicates movement away.

{| class="wikitable"
|+Verb inflection
|'''Aspect/mood'''
|'''Set B (absolutive)'''
|'''Movement'''
|'''Set A (ergative)'''
|'''Stem'''
|'''Status suffix'''

|'''k-'''
|'''at-'''
|
|
|'''b'in'''

|'''katb'inik''' "You walk."

|-
|'''k-'''
|'''Ø-'''
|'''ul-'''
|
|'''wa' '''
|'''-oq '''
|'''kulwa'oq''' "S/he comes and eats."
|}

The last morpheme on a verb, the so-called "status suffix", is a portmanteau morph whose form determined by a rather complicated set of rules.
Relevant factors include:
* whether the verb is transitive or intransitive
* whether the verb's mood is indicative or imperative
* whether or not the verb contains a movement marker
* whether or not the verb falls at the end of an intonational phrase

==== Voice and derivation ====
The examples above involve verbs with simple stems.  Verb stems may also be morphologically complex.  Complex stems may involve voice suffixes

* Causative: '''-isa''' ('''-kam-''' "die", '''-kam-isa-''' "kill (someone)")
* Passive: '''-x''' ('''-kuna-''' "cure (someone)", '''-kuna-x-''' "be cured")
* Completive passive: '''-taj''' ('''-kuna-''' "cure (someone)", '''-kuna-taj-''' "be completely cured; recover")
* Antipassive: '''-n''', '''-on''' or '''-un''' ('''-mes-''' "sweep (something) clean", '''-mes-on-''' "sweep up")

or derivational suffixes, many of which form verb stems from other parts of speech.  For instance, the versive suffix '''-ir''' or '''-ar''' forms verb stems from adjectives: '''utz''' "good", '''-utz-ir-''' "get good"; '''nim''' "big", '''-nim-ar-''' "get big."  Multiple suffixes can appear within a single stem: '''-nim-ar-''' "get big", '''-nim-ar-isa-''' "enlarge (something)", '''-nim-ar-isa-x-''' "be enlarged."

==Syntax==

As with all [[Mayan languages]], K'iche' has an [[ergative verb|ergative]] pattern of verb agreement, and often uses verb-object-subject (VOS) word order. Most modern speakers use SOV, SVO, and VSO word orders interchangeably. Language purists have tried to preserve the traditional verb-initial word order, while influence from Spanish (an SVO language) promotes a subject-initial order.

==Babytalk==
Contrary to the way many other languages use high pitch in [[Babytalk|child directed speech (babytalk)]], K'iche' babytalk has been shown not to use high pitch. Mayans in fact lower their pitch slightly when they speak to children, due to the fact that in the Quiche Mayan culture high pitch is very often used to address persons of high status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=5|edition=illustrated, reprint|pages=|year=2014|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|editor1=Zhu Hua|editor2=Lixian Jin|others=|volume=Volume 60 of Benjamins Current Topics|quote=|location=|title=Development of Pragmatic and Discourse Skills in Chinese-Speaking Children|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1y9wAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=mayan+girls+chinese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y6yiVc3UC4HDggSu8IDwBQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mayan%20girls%20chinese&amp;f=false|isbn=9027270260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="77530">The [[Greek language]] underwent [[sound change|pronunciation changes]] during the [[Koine Greek]] period, from about 300 BC to 300 AD. At the beginning of the period, the pronunciation was almost identical to [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]], while at the end it was closer to [[Modern Greek]].

==Overview==

The most significant changes during the Koine Greek period concerned [[vowel]]s: these were the loss of [[vowel length]] distinction, the shift of the [[Ancient Greek accent|Ancient Greek system]] of [[pitch accent]] to a [[stress accent]] system, and the [[monophthong]]ization of [[diphthong]]s (except {{lang|grc|αυ}} and {{lang|grc|ευ}}). These changes seem widely attested from the 2nd century BC in Egyptian Greek, and in the early 2nd century AD in learned Attic inscriptions; it is therefore likely that they were already common in the 2nd century BC and generalized no later than the 2nd century AD.

Another change was the [[fricative|fricatization]] of the second element of diphthongs {{lang|grc|αυ}} and {{lang|grc|ευ}}. This change likely took place after the vocalic changes described above occurred. It is attested in Egyptian Greek starting from the 1st century AD, and seems to have been generalized in the late Roman period.

Another series of changes was the fricatization of voiced [[stop consonant|stops]], which is widely attested in Egyptian Greek starting from the 1st century AD, but may have been generalized at a later date, possibly in the late Roman or early Byzantine periods.

Yet another series of changes was the fricatization of [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] voiceless stops, which is attested in several locations from the 1st century AD, but seems to have been generalized at a later date, possibly in the late Roman or early Byzantine period.

A last change (possibly related to fricatization of aspirated stops) is the loss of {{IPA|/h/}}, which may have begun as soon as the late 1st century BC in Egyptian Greek, seems to have taken place no earlier than the 2nd century AD in learned Attic inscription,{{citation needed|reason=I've not heard of any evidence for loss of {{IPA|/h/}} in learned Attic inscriptions: not that it didn't occur, there's just no graphic evidence for it.|date=February 2017}} and had most probably been generalized by the late Roman times.

==Issues with reconstructions==

The primary issue comes from the diversity of the Greek-speaking world: evidence suggests that phonological changes occurred at different times according to location and/or speaker background. It appears that many phonetic changes associated with the Koine period had already occurred in some varieties of Greek during the Classical period.

An opposition between learned language and vulgar language has been claimed for the corpus of Attic inscriptions. Some phonetic changes are attested in vulgar inscriptions since the end of the Classical period; still they are not generalized until the start of the 2nd century AD in learned inscriptions. While orthographic conservatism in learned inscriptions may account for this, contemporary transcriptions from Greek into Latin might support the idea that this is not just orthographic conservatism, but that learned speakers of Greek retained a conservative phonological system into the Roman period. On the other hand, Latin transcriptions, too, may be exhibiting orthographic conservatism.

Interpretation is more complex when different dating is found for similar phonetic changes in Egyptian papyri and learned Attic inscriptions. A first explanation would be dialectal differences (influence of foreign phonological systems through non-native speakers); changes would then have happened in Egyptian Greek before they were generalized in Attic. A second explanation would be that learned Attic inscriptions reflect a more learned variety of Greek than Egyptian papyri; learned speech would then have resisted changes that had been generalized in vulgar speech. A last explanation would be that the orthography in learned Attic inscriptions was artificially conservative; changes may then have been generalized no later than they are attested in Egyptian papyri. All these explanations are plausible to some degree, but would lead to different dating for the generalization of the same changes.

To sum this up, there is some measure of uncertainty in dating of phonetic changes; indeed, the exact dating and the rapidity of the generalization of Koine Greek phonological changes are still matters of discussion among researchers. Orthographic variants in contemporary written sources is the most direct evidence, but it is not enough to date a change in every context. Testimony of grammarians and, to a lesser extent, transcriptions into foreign language are interesting because they can indicate which pronunciation was regarded as standard by learned speakers; however, it has been argued that transcriptions may in some cases be conventional rather than phonetic, and Greek grammarians appear to describe learned pronunciation while ignoring established vulgar pronunciation.

==Sample reconstructed phonological systems==

===Boeotian, 4th century BC===
&lt;!-- Boeotian phonology and Boeotian Greek phonology redirect here --&gt;
Although it belongs to the late classical period rather than the Koine Greek period, Boeotian phonology is shown here as it prefigures several traits of later Koine phonology.

By the 4th century BC, Boeotian had monophthongized most diphthongs, and featured a fricative {{lang|grc|γ}}. Note that, in contrast with Ionic-Attic and Koine, {{lang|grc|υ}} had remained a back vowel in Boeotian (written {{lang|grc|ου}}). Long and short vowels were still distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;Verse texts in the Boeotian vernacular, such as the poetry of [[Corinna]], retain vowel length.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teodorsson argues that by 350 BC, the majority Attic dialect seemed to display similar values (except for {{lang|grc|υ}} which was a front vowel; perhaps controversially, his reconstruction has already cancelled vowel length distinctions and merged {{lang|grc|υ}} and {{lang|grc|η}} merged with {{IPA|/i/}} as in Modern Greek.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teodorsson|first1=Sven-Tage|title=The phonology of Attic in the Hellenistic period|date=1978|publisher=Göteborg University|location=Göteborg|pages=96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early monophthongization, and perhaps even vowel weakening due to the shift to a stress accent, is also attested in Thessalian of the 3rd century BC, suggesting that several minority dialects had an advanced vowel system by the early Hellenistic period.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 33-34)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Short vowels====

|}

Note that in this case when transcribing {{lang|grc|ε/ο}} (and also later {{lang|grc|αι/ω}}) the phonemic symbols {{IPA|/e/ and /o/}} denote true [[mid-vowel]]s, i.e. neither close nor open.&lt;ref&gt;Otherwise transcribed as {{IPA|/e̞/ and /o̞/}}. It will be noted specifically in the table if the same symbols are used to represent a [[close-mid vowel]] value (see below.) For the exacting quality of Greek mid vowels, see Allen, W. Sidney (1968) ''Vox Graeca: A guide to the pronunciation of classical Greek'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

The /yː/ value for {{lang|grc|οι}} is attested later, in the 3rd century BC. An intermediate value of /øː/ has been suggested by some, perhaps attested in spellings of {{lang|grc|ει}} for {{lang|grc|οι}} indicating a premature loss of lip-rounding leading to /eː/, rather than /iː/ (c.f. text below.)&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 163)&lt;/ref&gt;

Diphthongs {{lang|grc|αυ}} and {{lang|grc|ευ}} likely retained their classical pronunciation. A single interchange with -β, indicating an early change to {{IPA|/av, ev/}}, is found later, in the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gignac|first1=Francis T.|title=A Grammar of the Greek Papyri of the Roman and Byzantine Periods: Vol. 1 Phonology|date=1976|publisher=Instituto Editoriale Cisalpino-La Goliardica|location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fricative values for {{lang|grc|β}}, {{lang|grc|δ}}, {{lang|grc|φ}}, {{lang|grc|θ}} and {{lang|grc|χ}} are not unlikely, but are not attested in Boeotian in the 4th century BC.

No reference has been found on the status of the aspirate in Boeotian at this period.

====Accentuation====

The tonal accent system of Ancient Greek probably remained relevant.

====Sample phonetic transcription====

The following text, a Hellenistic Boeotian inscription, is rendered in a reconstructed pronunciation reflecting regional phonological developments. Monophthongization and vowel raising are clearly seen in the specialized Boeotian orthography which uses η instead of αι, ει for η and ηι (ῃ) and ω for ωι (ῳ.) There is also a spelling of ει for οι, indicating an early loss of lip-rounding resulting in /eː/, not /i(ː)/; it can therefore be inferred that at this stage οι became /øː/, not /y/. It is not implausible that in vulgar Attic the /y/ &gt; /i/ shift had already occurred in the 4th century BC, but was resisted in Koine due to conservative interference. Also notable is the continued use of digamma ϝ for /w/.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks, Geoffrey C. (2010). Greek: A history of the language and its speakers (2nd ed.). Oxford: Blackwell p. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learned pronunciation, 4th century BC until early Roman period===

Until the beginning of Roman times, some learned speakers may have retained a conservative pronunciation that preserved many traits of the Ancient Greek phonological system. However, already in the 4th century BC, the popular dialect in Athens may have been moving in the direction of the Koine without differences in vowel length, as noted above.&lt;ref&gt;Teordorsson (1978: 96-97)&lt;/ref&gt; Even in Attic official inscriptions, the learned pronunciation appears to have disappeared by the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. a spelling of υ for οι on an official inscription, noted in {{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=W. Sidney|title=Vox Graeca: A Guide to the Pronunciation of Classical Greek|date=1968|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=77, note 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "learned pronunciation" described here is mostly pre-Koine Attic.

The {{lang|grc|ει}} pseudo-diphthong was confused with {{lang|grc|ι}} in manuscripts, except before a vowel, where it was confused with {{lang|grc|η}}, so it probably retained its ancient value there.&lt;ref&gt;Note that /_C stands for pre-consonantal, /_V for pre-vocalic contexts and /_# for a word boundary. See Horrocks (2010: 168)&lt;/ref&gt; Note also that a monophthongal pronunciation of {{lang|grc|υι}} as {{IPA|/yː/}} is written in parentheses as a dialectal trait of Great Attic beginning in the late classical period.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 162-168)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, {{lang|grc|ῃ}} probably first lost its final element and merged with {{IPA|/eː/}}, but later raised to {{IPA|/iː/}} (as seen in alternations between spellings of {{lang|grc|ῃ}}/{{lang|grc|ει}} for the 2sg middle ending.) Both pronunciations are given as possible dialectal variants.&lt;ref&gt;C.f. differences in reconstructions of Attic versus Egyptian, Horrocks (2010: 163-167).&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Long first element diphthongs are written in parentheses because they were gradually monophthongized starting from the classical period; [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] prescribes them as a "correct" pronunciation, indicating that the diphthongs were no longer pronounced in natural speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teodorsson|first1=Sven-Tage|title=The Origin and Progress of the Greek Diglossia|journal=Sborník prací Filozofické fakulty brněnske univerzity|date=2001–2002|issue=6–7|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BC the process of monophthongization was over (see diachronic description below for more details).

Ancient grammarians and transcriptions suggest that voiced and aspirated stop consonants were retained until the beginning of the Roman period. The voiced stops probably became fricatives before the voiceless aspirates.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 170-171)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars regard {{IPA|[ŋ]}} as an allophone of {{IPA|[n]}}, others as a separate phoneme, which is why it is put in parentheses.

What exact sound {{lang|grc|ῥ}} represented is a matter of discussion, but it should probably be regarded as an allophone of the {{IPA|/r/}} notated by {{lang|grc|ρ}}.

{{lang|grc|ζ}} denotes a {{IPA|/zz/}} geminate between vowels.

====Accentuation====

"Learned speech" retained the tonal accent system of Ancient Greek.

===Egyptian Greek, mid 2nd century BC===

By around 150 BC Egyptian Greek had monophthongized diphthongs and lost vowel length distinction.

Confusion of {{lang|grc|ο}} with {{lang|grc|ω}} and of {{lang|grc|ε}} with {{lang|grc|αι}} in Egypt begin from this period on.  However, {{lang|grc|υ}} was not confused with {{lang|grc|οι}} before the 1st century BC, so is still represented in the intermediate phase of {{IPA|/ø/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teodorsson|first1=Sven-Tage|title=The phonology of Ptolemaic Koine|date=1977|publisher=Göteborg University|location=Göteborg|pages=253–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|grc|υ}} remained rounded, but apparently merged with {{IPA|/i/}} in certain conditions (see sample text below.)  Further confusion of {{lang|grc|ο}}/{{lang|grc|ω}} and {{lang|grc|ου}} is also common, indicating a neutralization of {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, perhaps with a closer articulation of {{IPA|/o/}}. However, distinction between close and mid back vowels is still maintained in the chart, because this development was likely an isolated regional trait related to Coptic influence, not affecting the development of the language generally.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 112, 118.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|grc|η}} was apparently distinguished from {{lang|grc|ε}} in quality, but at the same time was not regularly confused with {{lang|grc|ι}} (except under certain phonetic contexts, see sample text below.)  Therefore, it may represent the intermediate stage of a [[Relative articulation#Raised and lowered vowels|near close vowel]] {{IPA|/e̝/}}, pushed up the frontal axis to {{IPA|/i/}} along with the raising of {{IPA|/ɛː/}} ({{lang|grc|αι}}) to {{IPA|/e/}}. Once again, this new vowel is also the prevocalic value of {{lang|grc|ει}}.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 118, 162, 168)&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative route of development taken by other scholars is that {{lang|grc|αι}}, having initially monophthongized as {{IPA|/æː/}}, and {{lang|grc|ε}} {{IPA|/e/}} merged to acquire a middle value of {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, distinguished from the new close-mid {{IPA|/e/}} (written {{lang|grc|η}}), which would then be raised to {{IPA|/e/}} once {{lang|grc|η}} merged with {{lang|grc|ι}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bubeník|first1=Vít|title=Hellenistic and Roman Greece as a sociolinguistic area|date=1989|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam and Philadelphia|isbn=90-272-3551-1|pages=228}}, c.f. also Teodorsson (1978: 216)&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition of {{lang|grc|αυ}} and {{lang|grc|ευ}} from {{IPA|/au/}}, {{IPA|/eu/}} to {{IPA|/aβ/}}, {{IPA|/eβ/}} was likely already in progress. A probable intermediate [[Semivowel|semi-vocalic]] stage is therefore presented here.

Evidence for a fricative {{lang|grc|γ}} in Egyptian Greek dates as far back to the 4th century BC. From the 2nd century BC, these include omissions and insertions of {{lang|grc|γ}} before a front vowel which indicate a palatal fricative allophone in such positions.&lt;ref&gt;Teodorsson (1977: 241-243)&lt;/ref&gt; However, these may not have been standard pronunciations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  {{lang|grc|β}} likely did not become fricative till the 1st century AD.

Aspiration may have begun to disappear from popular speech in the 1st century BC.

====Accentuation====

The accent had changed to a stress accent.

====Sample phonetic transcription====

The following late Ptolemaic Egyptian papyrus from 154 BC is rendered in popular pronunciation including the loss of vowel length distinction and shift to a stress accent. The substitution of αι for ε points to monophthongization; for οι, this is still in the intermediate phase of /ø/, as inferred by the lack of confusion with υ. The interchange of ι for η and υ suggests an early raising to /i/ for the former and loss of lip-rounding for the latter; this occurs only in highly restricted phonetic conditions (i.e. in labial environments),&lt;ref name="Horrocks 2010: 118"&gt;Horrocks (2010: 118)&lt;/ref&gt; or may be an isolated dialectal trait. Horrocks' transcription already has a fricative γ with a palatal allophone before front vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Note, however, that Horrocks has chosen to transcribe this sound as {{IPA-el|j|}}, rather than {{IPA-el|ʝ|}}, assuming a palatal fricative and not an approximant value.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular pronunciation, 1st century BC &amp;ndash; 2nd century AD===

The loss of vowel length and the spread of Greek under Alexander the Great led to a reorganization of the vowels in the phonology of Koine Greek. There were no longer distinctions of long and short vowels in popular speech.

The monophthongization process was over by the 1st century BC with the final merger of {{lang|grc|οι}} and {{lang|grc|υ}}.

| {{IPA|[eɸʷ, eβʷ]}}(?)&lt;br /&gt;'''{{lang|grc|ευ}}'''
|}

In the Roman period the {{lang|grc|αυ}} and {{lang|grc|ευ}} diphthongs developed narrower articulations, possibly closing to {{IPA|[aɸʷ, aβʷ]}}, {{IPA|[eɸʷ, eβʷ]}} or even, depending on when lip-rounding was lost, {{IPA|[aɸ, aβ]}} and {{IPA|[eɸ, eβ]}}.&lt;ref name="Horrocks 2010: 169"&gt;Horrocks (2010: 169)&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 4th century AD interchanges of {{lang|grc|αυ/ευ}} with {{lang|grc|α(υ)ου/ε(υ)ου}} are still more common than confusions with {{lang|grc|αβ/εβ}},&lt;ref&gt;Gignac (1976: 232-233)&lt;/ref&gt; so many (if not most) speakers probably preserved the earlier pronunciations of the second element as a semi-vowel or labialized consonant.

By the 1st century the voiced consonants {{lang|grc|β}} and {{lang|grc|γ}} became fricatives {{IPA|/β/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, though {{lang|grc|δ}} probably remained plosive till the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Gignac (1976): 68-76&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of clear evidence for the fricativization of aspirated plosives in the Koine, {{lang|grc|φ}}, {{lang|grc|θ}}, and {{lang|grc|χ}} perhaps started to become fricatives in areas outside Egypt such as the northern Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Horrocks 2010: 171"&gt;Horrocks (2010: 171)&lt;/ref&gt;  See discussion below.

[[Spiritus asper|Aspiration]] had probably dropped out of popular speech, but possibly remained a characteristic of learned speech.&lt;ref&gt;Buth, page 225, note 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Accentuation lost distinctions of high and high-low tones, leaving only a high tone for a "stress" accent.

====Sample phonetic transcription====

The following papyrus letter from 100 AD is again transcribed in popular Koine pronunciation. It now shows fricative values for the second element in diphthongs αυ/ευ and for β, except in transliterations of Latin names,&lt;ref&gt;However, the pronunciation suggested by Horrocks is more advanced than the pronunciation indicated by the table above since αυ/ευ have fully transitioned to [av, ev].&lt;/ref&gt; but aspirated plosives remain plosive. Monophthongization and loss of vowel length are clearly seen in the graphic interchanges of ι/ει, υ/οι, and ω/o.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 172-173)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is frequent post-nasal voicing of voiceless stops, which is strengthened in Egypt because of Coptic influence but eventually standardized everywhere and is a rule in Modern Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 110-111)&lt;/ref&gt;

===4th century AD===

By the 4th century AD, the loss of vowel length distinction and aspiration was most probably generalized. {{lang|grc|η}} was often confused with {{lang|grc|ι}} (hence pronounced {{IPA|/i/}}?), but still occasionally with {{lang|grc|ε}} (presumably pronounced {{IPA|/e/}}, as it still is today in Eastern – i.&amp;nbsp;e., Pontic and Cappadocian – Greek dialects).&lt;ref&gt;Not all scholars agree that the Pontic pronunciation of {{lang|grc|η}} as {{lang|grc|ε}} is an archaism. Horrocks notes that {{lang|grc|ε}} is written for any letter or digraph representing {{IPA|/i/}} in other dialects––i.e. {{lang|grc|ι}}, {{lang|grc|ει}}, {{lang|grc|οι}}, or {{lang|grc|υ}}, which never represented the sound {{IPA|/ɛː/}} in Ancient Greek––not just {{lang|grc|η}}. He therefore attributes this phonological feature of East Greek to vowel weakening, paralleling the omission of unstressed vowels. Horrocks (2010: 400)&lt;/ref&gt; Fricative values for former voiced and aspirate stop consonants were probably already common; however, some dialects may have retained voiced and aspirate stop consonants until the end of the 1st millennium. The pronunciation suggested here, though far from being universal, is essentially that of [[Modern Greek phonology|Modern Greek]] except for the continued roundedness of {{IPA|/y/}}.

There is some confusion between {{lang|grc|η}} and {{lang|grc|ι}} in Attic and Asia Minor two centuries earlier. However, in the papyri, it is only from this period that interchange with symbols for {{IPA|/i/}}  becomes as common as that between {{lang|grc|ι}}/{{lang|grc|ει}}, {{lang|grc|ε}}/{{lang|grc|αι}} or {{lang|grc|υ}}/{{lang|grc|οι}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gignac (1976: 242)&lt;/ref&gt; The confusion between {{IPA|/y/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} had begun as early as the 2nd century BC in Egyptian Greek, but it was most probably not generalized in all phonetic positions yet.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 118-19, 162-63)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of evidence for the latter change in Egyptian papyri,&lt;ref&gt;Gignac (1976: 98-101)&lt;/ref&gt; it is perhaps not an unreasonable assumption that fricative values for both former voiced stops and voiceless aspirated stops were common in many other dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 170-171.)&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain as to when the palatal allophones for velars /k/ and /x/ appeared.

====Sample phonetic transcription====

The following excerpt from a late 4th century AD papyrus letter is rendered in late Roman/early Byzantine era popular Koine. Vowel length loss and monophthongization are presumed to be nearly universal in all regions, as is seen in the familiar interchanges of {{lang|grc|ι/ει}}, {{lang|grc|υ/οι}}, {{lang|grc|ε/α}}ι, and {{lang|grc|ω/ο}}. The misspelling of {{lang|grc|ὕμισυ}} for {{lang|grc|ἥμισυ}} again suggests, as noted above, that both {{lang|grc|η}} and {{lang|grc|υ}} merged with {{lang|grc|ι/ει}} before labials. By now, however, {{lang|grc|η}} (earlier Koine {{IPA|/e̝/}}?) had possibly fully raised to {{IPA|/i/}} in all positions, as is shown in the transcription. Aspiration has been lost, and both voiced plosives and voiceless aspirated plosives have become fricatives.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 183-184)&lt;/ref&gt; The omission of γ in the misspelling ὑιέvovτα (ὑγιαί–) may reflect a palatal allophone {{IPA|[ʝ]}} of velar fricative {{IPA|/ɣ/}} before front vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Gignac (1976: 71-72)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diachronic phonetic description==

===Loss of vowel quantity distinction===

The ancient distinction between long and short vowels was lost in popular speech at the beginning of the Koine period. "By the mid-second century [BCE] however, the majority system had undergone important changes, most notably monophthongization, the loss of distinctive length, and the shift to a primary stress accent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Horrocks|1997|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 2nd century BC, spelling errors in non-literary Egyptian papyri suggest stress accent and loss of vowel length distinction. The widespread confusion between {{lang|grc|ο}} and {{lang|grc|ω}} in Attic inscriptions starting in the 2nd century AD was probably caused by a loss of vowel length distinction.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=94"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to stress accent===

The means of accenting words changed from [[Pitch accent|pitch]] to [[Stress (phonology)|stress]], meaning that the accented syllable had only one tone option (high) and was presumably louder and/or stronger.  This shift directly corresponded with monophthongization and the loss of vowel timing distinctions, which destroyed the environment in which a pitch accent could be sustained.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 118, 169)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid 2nd century BC, spelling errors all over the Mediterranean, including occasional graphic omissions of unaccented vowels, suggest a loss of vowel length distinction, which is commonly thought to result in the loss of tonal accent.&lt;ref name="Horrocks 2010: 169"/&gt; More evidence of stress accent appears in poetry starting from the late 2nd century AD – early 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diphthongs===

====Spurious diphthongs====

Before a consonant, the diphthong {{lang|grc|ει}} had started to become monophthongal in Attic as early as the 6th century BC, and pronounced like {{lang|grc|ε̄}}, probably as {{IPA|/eː/}}. From the late 4th century BC in Attic, the [[spurious diphthong]] (pseudo-diphthong) {{lang|grc|ει}} (now notating both etymological {{lang|grc|ει}} and etymological {{lang|grc|ε̄}}) came to be pronounced like {{lang|grc|ῑ}}, probably as {{IPA|/iː/}} (with the [[vowel quality|quality]] that the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] still has in modern Greek).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|pp=69–72}}. Diphthong '{{lang|grc|ει}}' had already merged with {{lang|grc|ι}} in the 5th century BC in regions such as [[Argos]] or in the 4th century BC in [[Corinth]] (e.g. {{lang|grc|ΛΕΓΙΣ}}).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} It was also the case in [[Boeotia]] in the early 4th century BC (Allen, ''op. cit.'', page 74)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a vowel, the diphthong {{lang|grc|ει}} did not follow the same evolution as pre-consonantal {{lang|grc|ει}}.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=72–73"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|pp=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory to explain this difference is that pre-vocalic {{lang|grc|ει}} may have kept a diphthongal value {{IPA|[ej]}} until the 4th century BC, the {{IPA|[j]}} being progressively perceived as a glide from {{IPA|/e/}} to the next vowel.&lt;ref&gt;This perceived glide would explain why, in the 5th and 4th centuries BC in Attic, though there was no pre-vocalic {{lang|grc|ε̄}} that {{lang|grc|ει}} may have been confused with, {{lang|grc|ει}} was often written as {{lang|grc|ε}}; indeed, while the confusion seems to have ceased after the 4th century BC, several etymological pre-vocalic {{lang|grc|ει}} remain in altered {{lang|grc|ε̆}} form in Koine Greek. Such a perceived glide may actually be even older, since in Homeric verses etymological pre-vocalic {{lang|grc|ει}} is often written either as a short {{lang|grc|ε}} or a long {{lang|grc|ει}}. Allen, ''op. cit.'', page 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 4th century BC, the pre-vocalic diphthong {{lang|grc|ει}} came to be confused with {{lang|grc|η}}, which implies that, unlike before a consonant, it retained the value {{IPA|/eː/}}, probably with a loss of openness distinction with {{lang|grc|η}};&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=72–73"/&gt; for later evolution, refer to {{lang|grc|η}} below.

Starting from the 6th century in Attic, the diphthong {{lang|grc|ου}} had been monophthongized and confused with {{lang|grc|ο̄}}. While its initial value had probably been {{IPA|/oː/}}, it must have evolved to {{IPA|/uː/}} quite early (possibly in the 6th century BC, and at any rate before 350 BC); this vowel quality has been preserved through modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|pp=75–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Short-first-element i diphthongs====

Diphthong {{lang|grc|αι}} was probably monophthongized at first as {{IPA|/ε(ː)/}}.&lt;ref&gt;with a possible intermediate stage of {{IPA|/æ(ː)/}}, c.f. Horrocks (2010: 119,161)&lt;/ref&gt; This value is attested in Boeotian in the early 4th century BC with the Boeotian spelling of {{lang|grc|η}} for {{lang|grc|αι}}.&lt;ref&gt;This spelling (e.g. [[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]] 7.1672.6 {{lang|grc|Θειβῆος}} = {{lang|grc|Θηβαῖος}}, [[Corinna]] fr. 664 {{lang|grc|μέμφομη}} = {{lang|grc|μέμφομαι}}; cf. {{Harvcoltxt|Lejeune|1972|pp=230–1}}) indicates that the transition of {{lang|grc|αι}} to {{IPA|/ɛː/}} had taken place in Boeotian but not in Attic in the early 4th century BC {{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion of {{lang|grc|αι}} with {{lang|grc|ε}} suggests that this transition had taken place by the mid 2nd century BC in Egyptian Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Buth, ''Ἡ Κοινὴ Προφορά'', page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Further confusion between {{lang|grc|αι}} and {{lang|grc|ε}} is found in Palestine in the early 2nd century,&lt;ref name="Buth, op. cit., page 3"&gt;Buth, ''op. cit.'', page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the confusion between {{lang|grc|αι}} and {{lang|grc|ε}} starting from c. 125 AD in Attic suggests that the monophthongization took place in the early 2nd century AD in learned Attic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen thinks the transition to {{IPA|/e/}} (i.e. loss of openness distinction with {{lang|grc|ε}}) to have taken place later; while Allen is not very explicit on this point, this theory seems based on the observation that while both {{lang|grc|η}} and {{lang|grc|αι}} are confused with {{lang|grc|ε}}, {{lang|grc|αι}} is not confused with {{lang|grc|η}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=79}} The transition would then have taken place after the transition of {{lang|grc|η}} to {{IPA|/iː/}}~{{IPA|/i/}} was over in mainstream Greek, that is to say no earlier than the late Roman period or early Byzantine period.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all scholars seem to agree.&lt;ref name="Buth, op. cit., page 3"/&gt; No reference on this point of debate has been found.

Diphthong {{lang|grc|οι}} was monophthongized as {{IPA|/yː/}} or {{IPA|/y/}} (depending on when the loss of vowel length distinction took place).&lt;ref&gt;With possible intermediate states {{IPA|/øi/}} and {{IPA|/ø(ː)/}}, c.f. Horrocks (2010: 162.)&lt;/ref&gt; This is attested in Boeotian in the early as the 3rd century BC with a spelling of {{lang|grc|υ}} for {{lang|grc|οι}}, but this was probably a dialectal trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lejeune|1972|pp=230–1}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=81}}: e.g. [[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]] 7.283 etc. {{lang|grc|τῦς ἄλλυς προξένυς}} = {{lang|grc|τοῖς ἄλλοις προξένοις}},&lt;/ref&gt; Still, diphthong {{lang|grc|οι}} must have kept a diphthongal value at least in learned language until Roman times, as it is transcribed as ''oe'' in Latin. Further evidence of monophthongization is found from the early 1st century BC in Egyptian Greek, as well as in the early 2nd century AD in Palestine.&lt;ref name="Buth, op. cit., page 3"/&gt; Monophthongization in learned language seems attested by a {{lang|grc|υ}} spelling for {{lang|grc|οι}} found in a text dated from the early 2nd century AD and another from c. 240 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Look up note on evolution of {{lang|grc|υ}} for subsequent evolution.)

Koine Greek initially seems to feature diphthong {{lang|grc|υι}}, which had been progressively monophthongized to {{IPA|/yː/}} (written {{lang|grc|υ}} for {{lang|grc|ῡ}}) in Attic from the 6th century BC to the 4th century BC but retained in other Greek dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=81}}, note 54&lt;/ref&gt; It was later monophthongized as {{IPA|/yː/}} or {{IPA|/y/}} (depending on when the loss of vowel length distinction took place). (The author of these lines has not found any reference on when this change took place, but this transition may be phonologically linked to,  and at any rate is quite unlikely to have taken place after, the similar transition of {{lang|grc|οι}} to {{IPA|/y(ː/)}}). (See discussion on {{lang|grc|υ}} below for subsequent evolution.)

====Short-first-element u diphthongs====

Diphthongs {{lang|grc|αυ}} and {{lang|grc|ευ}} lost their ancient value of {{IPA|/au, eu/}} and [[fortition|fortified]] to a fricative consonantal pronunciation of {{IPA|/aβ, eβ/}} or {{IPA|/av, ev/}}, through the likely intermediate stages of {{IPA|/aw, ew/}} and then {{IPA|/aβʷ, eβʷ/}}&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks 2010: 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Comparable to the modern pronunciation of {{IPA|/av, ev/}} (partially [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilated]] to {{IPA|[af, ef]}} before [[voiceless consonant]]s {{lang|grc|θ}}, {{lang|grc|κ}}, {{lang|grc|ξ}}, {{lang|grc|π}}, {{lang|grc|ς}}, {{lang|grc|τ}}, {{lang|grc|φ}}, {{lang|grc|χ}}, and {{lang|grc|ψ}}, this assimilation being undated).&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadic confusions of {{lang|grc|αυ/ευ}} with {{lang|grc|αβ/εβ}}, which attest a fricative pronunciation, are found as early as 3rd century BC Boeotia and in 2nd century BC Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;In Egypt ῥάυδους for ῥάβδους, Gignac (1976: page 233, note 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Further such confusions appear rarely in the papyri at the beginning of the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|πνευτύνις}} for {{lang|grc|πνεβτύνι}} for the early bilabial fricative stage, Buth, ''op. cit.'', page 4, note 8, citing Francis Thomas Gignac, ''A Grammar of the Greek Papyri of the Roman and Byzantine Periods. Volume One: Phonology. Milan 1976'', pages 68, note 1, and page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gignac notes that before the Late Roman/Early Byzantine period spellings with {{lang|grc|α(υ)ου/ε(υ)ου}} are more common, which more likely represent the earlier transitional phases of {{IPA|/aw, ew/}} or {{IPA|/aβʷ, eβʷ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. fluctuation among writing {{lang|grc|φλαυου–}}, {{lang|grc|φλαου–}} or {{lang|grc|φλαυ–}} for Latin ''Flauius'', Gignac (1976: 232).&lt;/ref&gt; Allen also believes that the fricative pronunciation was not generalized at once; for instance, Jewish catacombs inscriptions still show a diphthongal value in the 2nd–3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=80}}, note 47&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion of {{lang|grc|αυ}} and {{lang|grc|ευ}} with {{lang|grc|αβ/εβ}} becomes increasingly common in late Roman and early Byzantine times, which suggests that it had been generalized by this time.&lt;ref name="Horrocks 2010: 169"/&gt; Outside of Egypt, spellings with {{lang|grc|αβ/εβ}} are also found in Asia Minor, from the Late Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwyzer|first1=Eduard|title=Griechische Grammatik|date=1990|publisher=Verlag C.H. Beck|location=Munich|isbn=3-406-01339-2|pages=198|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, indirect evidence comes from transcriptions into foreign languages, such as Coptic ''Hippef'' for {{lang|grc|ἱππεῦ}} (2nd century AD),&lt;ref&gt;Schwyzer (1990: 198)&lt;/ref&gt; or Byzantine Late Hebrew/Aramaic transcriptions of {{lang|grc|αυ/ευ}} with אב (''ab-'').&lt;ref&gt;Bubeník (1989: 228)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Long-first-element i diphthongs====

Diphthong {{lang|grc|ῃ}}&lt;ref&gt;note that the subscript {{lang|grc|ι}} notation is medieval, the {{lang|grc|ι}} is adscript in ancient texts where it appears&lt;/ref&gt; had started to become monophthongal in Attic at least as early as the 4th century BC as it was often written {{lang|grc|ει}} and probably pronounced {{IPA|[eː]}}. In Koine Greek, most {{lang|grc|ῃ}} were therefore subjected to the same evolution as original classical {{IPA|/eː/}} and came to be pronounced {{IPA|/i(ː)/}}. However, in some inflexional endings (mostly 1st declension dative singular and subjunctive 3S), the evolution was partially reverted from c. 200 BC, probably by analogy of forms of other cases/persons, to {{lang|grc|η}} and was probably pronounced {{IPA|/eː/}} at first (look up note on evolution of {{lang|grc|η}} for subsequent evolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other long-first-element {{lang|grc|ι}} diphthongs ({{lang|grc|ᾳ}} and {{lang|grc|ῳ}}&lt;ref&gt;once again, the subscript notation is medieval&lt;/ref&gt; became monophthongal by the 2nd century BC, as they were written {{lang|grc|α}} and {{lang|grc|ω}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=86}}. However, when augmented from {{lang|grc|οι}} in verbs, diphthong {{lang|grc|ῳ}} had been altered to {{lang|grc|οι}} instead ({{Harvcolnb|Allen|1987|p=87}}), note 70&lt;/ref&gt; the former was probably pronounced {{IPA|/a(ː)/}}, while the later may have been pronounced {{IPA|/ɔ(ː)/}} at first if openness distinction had not been lost yet, and was eventually pronounced {{IPA|/o(ː)/}} at any rate (look up discussion of single vowels {{lang|grc|ο}} and {{lang|grc|ω}} below for details).  From the 2nd century AD, Atticism caused for a widespread reintroduction of the ancient spelling with the final {{lang|grc|ι}}, but in any case was not pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 175)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Long-first-element u diphthongs====

When augmented from {{lang|grc|ευ}} in verbs, diphthong {{lang|grc|ηυ}} had been altered to {{lang|grc|ευ}} from the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=87}}, note 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Other long-first-element {{lang|grc|υ}} diphthongs ({{lang|grc|ᾱυ}}, {{lang|grc|ηυ}} and {{lang|grc|ωυ}}) had become monophthongal from the 1st century BC, as they were written as {{lang|grc|α}}, {{lang|grc|η}} and {{lang|grc|ω}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first was probably pronounced {{IPA|/a(ː)/}}, while the two later may have been pronounced {{IPA|/ɛ(ː)/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ(ː)/}} at first if openness distinction had not been lost yet ({{IPA|/e(ː)/}} and {{IPA|/o(ː)/}} otherwise), and were eventually pronounced {{IPA|/i(ː)/}} and {{IPA|/o(ː)/}} at any rate (look up discussions of single vowels {{lang|grc|ο}} and {{lang|grc|ω}} and single vowel {{lang|grc|η}} below for details).

===Single vowel quality===

Apart from {{lang|grc|η}}, simple vowels have better preserved their ancient pronunciation than diphthongs.

As noted above, at the start of the Koine Greek period, pseudo-diphthong {{lang|grc|ει}} before consonant had a value of {{IPA|/iː/}}, whereas pseudo-diphthong {{lang|grc|ου}} had a value of {{IPA|[uː]}}; these vowel qualities have remained unchanged through Modern Greek. Diphthong {{lang|grc|ει}} before vowel had been generally monophthongized to a value of {{IPA|/i(ː)/}} and confused with {{lang|grc|η}}, thus sharing later developments of {{lang|grc|η}}.

The quality of vowels {{lang|grc|α}}, {{lang|grc|ε̆}}, {{lang|grc|ι}} and {{lang|grc|ο}} have remained unchanged through Modern Greek, as {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Note again that in this case the symbols {{IPA|/e, o/}} transcribe true [[mid vowel]]s, rather than close-mid values.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels {{lang|grc|ο}} and {{lang|grc|ω}} started to be regularly confused in Attic inscriptions starting in the 2nd century AD, which may indicate that the quality distinction was lost around this time. However, this may as well indicate the loss of length distinction, with an earlier or simultaneous loss of quality distinction. Indeed, the fact that some less systematic confusion is found in Attic inscriptions from the 4th century BC may alternatively point to a loss of openness distinction in the 4th century BC, and the systematization of the confusion in the 2nd century AD would then have been caused by the loss of length distinction.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=94"/&gt;

The quality distinction between {{lang|grc|η}} and {{lang|grc|ε}} may have been lost in Attic in the late 4th century BCE, when pre-consonantic pseudo-diphthong {{lang|grc|ει}} started to be confused with {{lang|grc|ι}} and pre-vocalic diphthong {{lang|grc|ει}} with {{lang|grc|η}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=73}}. This evolution had probably happened by the early 4th century BCE in Boeotian but definitively not in Attic, as shown by e.g. Boeotian {{lang|grc|πατειρ}} vs Attic {{lang|grc|πατήρ}} ({{Harvcolnb|Allen|1987|p=74}})&lt;/ref&gt; C. 150 AD, Attic inscriptions started confusing {{lang|grc|η}} and {{lang|grc|ι}}, indicating the appearance of a {{IPA|/iː/}} or {{IPA|/i/}} (depending on when the loss of vowel length distinction took place) pronunciation that is still in usage in standard Modern Greek; however, it seems that some locutors retained the {{IPA|/e̝/}} pronunciation for some time, as Attic inscriptions continued to in parallel confuse {{lang|grc|η}} and {{lang|grc|ε}}, and transcriptions into Gothic and, to some extent, old Armenian transcribe {{lang|grc|η}} as e.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it is noted that while interchange of {{lang|grc|η}} and {{lang|grc|ι/ει}} does occur in the Ptolemaic and Roman period, these only occur in restrictive phonetic conditions or may otherwise be explained due to grammatical developments.&lt;ref&gt;As an example, c.f. the Ptolemaic papyrus above in which {{lang|grc|η}} shifts to {{IPA|/i/}} in pre-labial conditions.  As for grammatical explanations of certain errors, the falling together of perfect and aorist tenses in the Koine could have created confusion between aorist {{lang|grc|ἧκα}} and perfect {{lang|grc|εἷκα}}, c.f. Horrocks (2010: 168)&lt;/ref&gt;

Koine Greek adopted for vowel {{lang|grc|υ}} the pronunciation {{IPA|/y/}} of Ionic-Attic. Confusion of {{lang|grc|υ}} with {{lang|grc|ι}} appears in Egyptian papyri from the 2nd century BC and 2nd century AD, suggesting a pronunciation of {{IPA|/i/}}, but this occurs only in restricted phonetic conditions or may be a regional trait (since Coptic did not have {{IPA|/y/}}.)&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 168-69)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcriptions into Gothic and, to some extent, Armenian suggest that {{lang|grc|υ}} still retained a {{IPA|/y/}} pronunciation, and the transition to {{IPA|/i/}} in mainstream Greek is thought to have taken place at the end of the 1st millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=68}}, note 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of aspiration===

The aspirate breathing ([[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], referring here to the phoneme {{IPA|/h/}}, which is usually marked by the [[rough breathing]] sign), which was already lost in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] idioms of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]] of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]] ([[psilosis]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lejeune|1972|pp=281–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; later stopped being pronounced in Koine Greek. Incorrect or hypercorrect markings of assimilatory aspiration (i.e. un-aspirated plosive becomes aspirated before initial aspiration) in Egyptian papyri suggest that this loss was already under way in Egyptian Greek in the late 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{lang|grc|ἐπ' οἷς}} for {{lang|grc|ἐφ' οἷς}}, Randall Buth, ''op. cit.'', page 5–6, citing Gignac, ''op. cit.'', page 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Transcriptions into foreign languages and consonant changes before aspirate testify that this transition must not have been generalized before the 2nd century AD, but transcriptions into Gothic show that it was at least well under way in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===

Among consonants, only {{lang|grc|β}}, {{lang|grc|δ}}, {{lang|grc|γ}} and {{lang|grc|ζ}} are certain to have changed from Classical Greek.  Consonants {{lang|grc|φ}}, {{lang|grc|θ}} and {{lang|grc|χ}} are assumed to have changed, too, but there is some disagreement amongst scholars over evidence for these.

The consonant {{lang|grc|ζ}}, which had probably a value of {{IPA|/zd/}} in Classical Attic&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=58}}, note 115&lt;/ref&gt; (though some scholars have argued in favor of a value of {{IPA|/dz/}}, and the value probably varied according to dialects – see [[Zeta (letter)]] for further discussion), acquired the sound {{IPA|/z/}} that it still has in Modern Greek, seemingly with a geminate pronunciation {{IPA|/zz/}} at least between vowels. Attic inscriptions suggest that this pronunciation was already common by the end of the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horrocks agrees with Gignac on finding evidence that [[geminate]] consonants tended to simplify beginning from the 3rd century BC, as seen in their arbitrary use in less literate writing.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{lang|grc|πρόγραμα}} for {{lang|grc|πρόγραμμα}}, Horrocks (2010: 171, 175)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gignac (1976: 154-165)&lt;/ref&gt; However, degemination was not carried out universally, as seen where the South Italian, south-eastern and some Asia Minor dialects preserve double consonants.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 274)&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants {{lang|grc|φ}}, {{lang|grc|θ}}, which were initially pronounced as [[Aspirated consonant|aspirate]]s {{IPA|/pʰ/}} and {{IPA|/tʰ/}}, developed into fricatives {{IPA|/f/}}&lt;ref&gt;An intermediate stage of {{IPA|[ɸ]}} has been proposed by some, but there is no specific evidence to support this ({{Harvcolnb|Allen|1987|p=25}})&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IPA|[θ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;A transitional affricate stage, e.g. {{IPA|/pf, tθ, kx/}}, is also possible.  This would then simplify to {{IPA|/f, θ, x/}} in the contexts of clusters involving other voiceless fricatives due to resulting difficult pronunciations, e.g. {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/f/}}, c.f. {{harvcoltxt|Horrocks|2010|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is no specific evidence of the transition of consonant {{lang|grc|χ}} from aspirate {{IPA|/kʰ/}} to fricative {{IPA|[x~ç]}} in the Koine Greek period. There is evidence for fricative {{lang|grc|θ}} in Laconian in the 5th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Aristophanes {{lang|grc|Εἰρήνη}}, l. 214, {{lang|grc|σιώ}} for {{lang|grc|θεώ}} ({{Harvcolnb|Allen|1987|p=26}})&lt;/ref&gt; but this is unlikely to have influenced Koine Greek which is largely based on Ionic-Attic.  According to Allen, the first clear evidence for fricative {{lang|grc|φ}} and {{lang|grc|θ}} in Koine Greek dates from the 1st century AD in Latin Pompeian inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Particularly meaningful is ''lasfe'' found for {{lang|grc|λάσθη}} ({{Harvcolnb|Allen|1987|p=23}})&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, evidence suggest an aspirate pronunciation for {{lang|grc|θ}} in Palestine in the early 2nd century,&lt;ref&gt;Randall Buth, ''op. cit.'', page 4&lt;/ref&gt; and Jewish catacomb inscriptions of the 2nd–3rd century AD suggest a pronunciation of {{IPA|/f/}} for {{lang|grc|φ}}, {{IPA|/tʰ/}} for {{lang|grc|θ}} and {{IPA|/kʰ/}} for {{lang|grc|χ}}, which would testify that the transition of {{lang|grc|θ}} to a fricative was not yet general at this time, and suggests that the transition of {{lang|grc|φ}} to a fricative may have happened before the transition of {{lang|grc|θ}} and {{lang|grc|χ}}.&lt;ref name="Allen 1987 24"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be evidence for fricative {{lang|grc|φ}} in 2nd century AD Attic, in the form of omission of the second element in the {{lang|grc|ευ}} diphthongs (which pronounced {{IPA|[ef, ev]}}) before {{lang|grc|φ}}.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{lang|grc|Ἐφρονίς}} for {{lang|grc|Εὐφρονίς}}, Horrock (2010:171), citing Konrad Meisterhans (1900), ''Grammatik der attischen Inschriften''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Armenian|Armenian]] transcriptions transcribe {{lang|grc|χ}} as {{IPA|/kʰ/}} until the 10th century AD, so it seems that {{lang|grc|χ}} was pronounced as aspirate by at least some speakers until then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is disagreement as to when consonants {{lang|grc|β}}, {{lang|grc|γ}} and {{lang|grc|δ}}, which were originally pronounced {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, acquired the value of {{IPA|/v/}},&lt;ref&gt;An intermediate stage of {{IPA|/β/}} has been proposed by some, cf. {{Harvcoltxt|Horrocks|1997|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|[ɣ~ʝ]}}, and {{IPA|/ð/}} that they have in Modern Greek.&lt;ref&gt;except when preceded by a nasal consonant (μ, ν, γ); in that case, they retain their ancient sounds (e.g. {{lang|grc|γαμβρός}} &gt; {{lang|grc|γαμπρός}} {{IPA|[ɣamˈbros]}}, {{lang|grc|ἀνήρ, ἄνδρα}} &gt; {{lang|grc|άντρας}} {{IPA|[ˈandras]}}, {{lang|grc|ἄγγελος}} &gt; {{lang|grc|άγγελος}} – {{IPA|[ˈaɲɟelos]}})&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of fricative {{lang|grc|γ}} as far back as the 4th century BC, in the form of omissions before a back vowel.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{lang|grc|ὀλίος}} fοr {{lang|grc|ὀλίγος}}, Gignac (1976: note 1, page 71)&lt;/ref&gt; In the papyri from the 2nd century BC {{lang|grc|γ}} is sometimes omitted or inserted before a front vowel, which indicates a palatal allophone {{IPA|[ʝ]}} or {{IPA|[j]}}.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{lang|grc|ἱγεροῦ}} for {{lang|grc|ἱεροῦ}}, Teodorsson (1978: 186-187)&lt;/ref&gt; However, to Allen these do not seem to have been a standard pronunciation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have argued that the replacement of old Greek {{lang|grc|ϝ}} {{IPA|/w/}} with {{lang|grc|β}} in certain late classical dialects indicates a fricative pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{lang|grc|βοικία}}, Bubeník (1989: 188)&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient grammarians describe the plosive nature of these letters, {{lang|grc|β}} is transcribed as ''b'', not ''v'', in Latin, and [[Cicero]] still seems to identify {{lang|grc|β}} with Latin b.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gignac finds evidence from non-literary papyri suggesting a fricative pronunciation in some contexts (mostly intervocalic) from about the 1st century AD, in the form of the use of {{lang|grc|β}} to transcribe Latin "v" (which was [[Vulgar Latin#Neutralization of /b/ and /w/|also undergoing a fortition process from semi-vowel /w/ to fricative /β/]].)&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{lang|grc|Σερβικίου}} for {{lang|grc|Σερουικίου}}, Gignac (1976: 68-69)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Allen is again sceptical that this pronunciation was generalized yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=32}}, note 46&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly common confusion of {{lang|grc|αυ}} and {{lang|grc|ευ}} with {{lang|grc|αβ}} and {{lang|grc|εβ}} in late Roman and early Byzantine times suggests that the fricative pronunciation of {{lang|grc|β}} was common if not general by this time.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Buth, ''op. cit.'', page 4, note 8, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Horrocks|1997|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{lang|grc|προσαγορεύβομε}} for {{lang|grc|προσαγορεύομαι}}, Gignac (1976:
 70)&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, it is not before the 10th century AD that transcriptions of {{lang|grc|β}} as fricative {{lang|hy|վ}} ''v'' or {{lang|grc|γ}} as voiced velar {{lang|hy|ղ}} ''ł'' (pronounced {{IPA|[ɣ~ʁ]}}) are found in Armenian, which suggests that the transition was not general before the end of the 1st millennium; however, previous transcriptions may have been learned transcriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1987|p=32}}, note 45&lt;/ref&gt; Georgian loans in the 9th-10th centuries similarly show inconsistency in transcribing {{lang|grc|β}} and {{lang|grc|γ}} as a stop or fricative; {{lang|grc|β}} is consistently rendered as ბ ''b'' rather than ვ ''v'', while {{lang|grc|γ}} may be written with an adapted symbol for fricative {{IPA|/ɣ/}} or with ჟ {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (approximating {{IPA|[ʝ]}} in palatal position), but also with stop გ ''g.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macharadse|first1=Neil A.|title=Zur Lautung der griechischen Sprache der byzantinischen Zeit|journal=Jahrbuch der Österreichischen Byzantinistik|date=1980|issue=29|pages=152–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is probable evidence for a peculiarly early shift of {{IPA|/d/}}&gt;{{IPA|/ð/}} in 6th century BC Elean, seen in the writing of {{lang|grc|ζ}} for {{lang|grc|δ}}.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{lang|grc|ζέ}} for {{lang|grc|δέ}}, Horrocks (2010: 31), citing Julián Méndez Dosuna, "On ⟨Z⟩ for ⟨Δ⟩ in Greek dialecal inscriptions", ''Sprache 35'', 82-114&lt;/ref&gt; Gignac interprets similar spellings in the Egyptian papyri beginning in the 1st century AD as the spirant pronunciation for δ in the Koine, but before the 4th century AD these only occur before {{IPA|/i/}}.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{lang|grc|ζακοσίας}} for {{lang|grc|διακοσίας}}, Gignac (1976: 75-76)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, not all scholars agree that there is a reasonable phonetic basis for the earlier fricativization of δ before ι.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 170), citing Méndez Dosuna, Review of G.C. Horrocks (1997), ''Greek: a history of the language and its speakers,'' London, in ''Journal of Greek Linguistics'' 1, 274-95&lt;/ref&gt;

The weakness of final {{lang|grc|ν}} {{IPA|/n/}}, frequently before a stop consonant, is attested in Egypt in both Hellenistic and Roman times, seen directly in graphic omission and [[hypercorrection|hypercorrect]] insertion, though its complete loss would not be carried through until the medieval period and excluding the South-Italian, south-eastern and Asia Minor dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 171, 274)&lt;/ref&gt; The development of voiced allophones {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[g]}} of voiceless stops {{lang|grc|π}}, {{lang|grc|τ}}, and {{lang|grc|κ}} after nasals is also evidenced in Pamphylia as early as the 4th century BC and in the Egyptian papyri (mostly Roman period) in the interchange with {{lang|grc|β}}, {{lang|grc|δ}}, and {{lang|grc|γ}} in post-nasal positions (where these letters retained there their ancient plosive values, as noted above.)&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Pamphylian πέδε for πέντε, Egyptian {{lang|grc|πέμβτης}} for {{lang|grc|πέμπτης}}, Bubeník (1989: 220, 239)&lt;/ref&gt; Hence {{lang|grc|μπ}}, {{lang|grc|ντ}}, {{lang|grc|γκ}} would later be used for {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/g/}}, via assimilation to the second element.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{IPA|[ˈpente] &gt; [ˈpende] &gt; [ˈpedde] &gt; [ˈpede]}}, Horrocks (2010: 111), c.f. Pamphylian evidence above.&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt this development is seen as an influence of the Coptic substrate.&lt;ref&gt;Gignac (1976: 81-84, 178-179)&lt;/ref&gt; But at the same time, this change has now become standard in Modern Greek, and so it appears to have occurred in other areas as well.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks (2010: 111, 172)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Koro''' is a possibly [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] spoken by approximately 800–1,500 people in the [[East Kameng district]] at the western end of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[India]]. Few speakers are under 20 years old.&lt;ref name=NG/&gt; The people live among the [[Hruso people|Aka (Hruso)]], but their language is only distantly related, with distinct words for numerals, body parts, and other basic vocabulary.&lt;ref name=NG&gt;Morrison, Dan [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101005-lost-language-india-science/ "'Hidden' Language Found in Remote Indian Tribe"].

[http://www.physorg.com/news205512282.html "Undocumented language found hidden in India"].

==Identification==
Recognition in the academic literature of Koro as a distinct language goes back at least to the 2009 edition of the ''Ethnologue'' (Lewis 2009), which based its findings on a language survey conducted in 2005. It notes that Koro has only 9 percent lexical similarity with Hruso Aka, and that it is "highly dissimilar to neighboring languages".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. ''Ethnologue: Languages of the World'', Sixteenth edition. Dallas, TX: SIL International, "Hruso".[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=hru]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, the ''National Geographic Daily News'' published an article corroborating the findings of the ''Ethnologue'' based on research conducted in 2008 by a linguistic team of [[K. David Harrison|David Harrison]], [[Gregory Anderson (linguist)|Gregory Anderson]], and Ganesh Murmu while documenting two [[Hruso languages]] ([[Hruso language|Aka]] and [[Dhammai language|Miji]]) as part of [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'s "[[Enduring Voices]]" project.&lt;ref name= NG/&gt; It was reported to them as a dialect of Aka, but turned out to be highly divergent.

Mark Post &amp; [[Roger Blench]] (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Post, Mark W. and Roger Blench (2011). "Siangic: A new language phylum in North East India", ''6th International Conference of the North East India Linguistics Society'', Tezpur University, Assam, India, Jan 31 – Feb 2.&lt;/ref&gt; propose that Koro is related to [[Milang language|Milang]] in a branch, or perhaps independent family, they call [[Siangic languages|Siangic]].

The '''''Language Atlas of China''''' ({{zh|s=中国语言地图集|p=Zhōngguó Yǔyán Dìtú Jí}}), published in two parts in 1987 and 1989, maps the distribution of both the [[varieties of Chinese]] and minority [[languages of China]].
It was a colloborative effort by the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]] and the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], published simultaneously in the original Chinese and in English translation.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Hugh D.R | last = Baker | title = ''Language Atlas of China'' | journal = Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | year = 1993 | pages = 398–399 | doi = 10.1017/S0041977X0000598X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition was published in 2012.

== Classification of Chinese varieties ==
[[File:Map of sinitic languages full-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Top-level groups and supergroups of Chinese varieties identified in the ''Atlas'']]
The atlas organizes the [[varieties of Chinese]] in a hierarchy of groupings, following the work of [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]]:&lt;ref name="Kurpaska"/&gt;
* supergroups (大区 ''dàqū''): [[Mandarin dialects|Mandarin]] and [[Min dialects|Min]]
* groups (区 ''qū''): [[Jin dialects|Jin]], [[Wu dialects|Wu]], [[Hui dialects|Hui]], [[Xiang dialects|Xiang]], [[Gan dialects|Gan]], [[Hakka dialects|Hakka]], [[Yue dialects|Yue]], [[Pinghua]] and groups within Mandarin and Min
* subgroups (片 ''piàn'')
* clusters (小片 ''xiǎopiàn'') are only identified for some subgroups
* local dialects (点 ''diǎn''): localities that were surveyed

== Contents ==
The atlas contains 36 colour maps, divided into three sections:&lt;ref name="Kurpaska"&gt;{{cite book | first = Maria | last = Kurpaska | title = Chinese Language(s): A Look Through the Prism of "The Great Dictionary of Modern Chinese Dialects" | publisher = [[Walter de Gruyter]] | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-3-11-021914-2 | pages = 63–64 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lCgnrA7Ke3QC&amp;pg=PA63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maps are printed on loose white sheets measuring {{cvt|15|in|cm}} by {{cvt|20.75|in|cm}}.
Each map is accompanied by a blue sheet of the same size containing explanatory notes.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt;

== Second edition ==
Work began on revised edition in 2002.&lt;ref name ="Wilkinson"/&gt;
The work was published in 2012 as a joint venture between the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the [[City University of Hong Kong]].
It consists of two volumes, dealing respectively with varieties of Chinese and minority languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title = 中国语言地图集(第2版):汉语方言卷 | title = Zhōngguó yǔyán dìtú jí (dì 2 bǎn): Hànyǔ fāngyán juǎn | trans-title = Language Atlas of China (2nd edition): Chinese dialect volume | publisher = The Commercial Press | location = Beijing | url = http://www.cp.com.cn/book/8094abe4-a.html | access-date = 10 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title = 中国语言地图集(第2版):少数民族语言卷 | title = Zhōngguó yǔyán dìtú jí (dì 2 bǎn): shǎoshù mínzú yǔyán juǎn | trans-title = Language Atlas of China (2nd edition): Minority languages volume | publisher = The Commercial Press | location = Beijing | url = http://www.cp.com.cn/book/8094abe4-b.html | access-date = 10 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The revision follows the same structure as the first edition, but the number of maps has increased to 79, and the explanatory text is greatly expanded.
The number of minority languages covered has also increased from 81 to 130.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title = 《中国语言地图集》(第2版)评介 | trans-title = ''Language Atlas of China'' (2nd edition): review | date = 2014 | surname = Xu | given = Ruiyuan 徐睿渊 | publisher = CASS | url = http://www.cssn.cn/ts/ts_sksp/201406/t20140610_1203668.shtml | access-date = 13 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language arts''' (also known as [[English language|English]] language arts) is the study and improvement of the arts of language. Traditionally, the primary divisions in language arts are [[literature]] and language, where language in this case refers to both [[linguistics]], and specific [[language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"The Road to [[Middle-earth|Middle-Earth]]", T. A. Shippey&lt;/ref&gt; Language arts instruction typically consists of a combination of [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]] (composition), [[speaking]], and listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.com/reference/article/components-language-arts-curriculum/|title=The Four Components of the Language Arts Curriculum  {{!}} Education.com|website=www.education.com|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools, language arts is taught alongside [[science]], [[mathematics]], and [[social studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://teach.com/what/teachers-know/english-and-language-arts/|title=English and Language Arts Teacher|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading==
[[Reading (process)|Reading]], by definition, is the ability and knowledge of a language that allows comprehension by grasping the meaning of written or printed characters, words, or sentences. Reading involves a wide variety of print and non-print texts that helps a reader gain an understanding of the material that is being read. Reading of texts that are often included in educational curriculum include [[fiction]], [[nonfiction]], classic, and also contemporary works. Reading goes beyond calling words to understanding the information presented in a written or a visual context.

==Composition==
Composition is defined as the combination of distinct parts or elements to form a whole and the manner in which these elements are combined or related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=composition|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/composition|journal=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are examples of composing in language arts:
* The art or act of composing a [[literary]] work (i.e. novels, speeches, poems)
* A short [[essay]], especially one written as an academic exercise. An essay is a short literary composition on a particular [[Theme (literature)|theme]] or subject, usually in [[prose]] and generally analytic, speculative, or interpretative. There are many types of short essays, including:
**[[Five-paragraph essay]]
**Argumentative essay
**Cause and effect essay
**Comparative essay

Compositions may also include:
* [[Narrative]] essays
* [[Expository]] essays
* [[Persuasive]] essays
* [[Technical writing]] essays
* [[Research]] essays
* [[Book|Books]]
* [[Vignette (literature)|Vignettes]] 
* [[Poetry|Poems]]

== Speaking ==
Oration and live delivery are often key components of language arts programs. This can include through dramatic interpretation, speeches, oral interpretation of poetry, and the like. Speaking is a valuable way to enhance concepts of persuasion, and develop linguistic skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://englishlive.ef.com/blog/study-tips/five-reasons-speaking-english-great-way-learn/|title=Five reasons why speaking English is a great way to learn it|website=englishlive.ef.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Listening ==
Listening can be considered the basis for development of speaking, reading, and writing skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.com/reference/article/language-arts/|title=The Language Arts {{!}} Education.com|website=www.education.com|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the act of understanding spoken language, and is often paired with speaking.

The '''langues d'oïl''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɔɪ|(|l|)|,_|d|ɔː|ˈ|iː|l}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/langue%20d'oil Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/langue_d%27oil Oxford Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=langue+d%27oil American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|lɑ̃ɡdɔjl|lang}})&lt;ref&gt;''Le [[Petit Robert]] 1'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; or '''oïl languages''' ({{lang-fr|langues d'oui|links=no}} {{IPA-fr|lɑ̃ɡdwi|}}) are a [[dialect continuum]] that includes standard [[French language|French]] and its closest [[Indigenous language|autochthonous]] relatives historically spoken in the northern half of [[France]], southern [[Belgium]], and the [[Channel Islands]]. These belong to the larger [[Gallo-Romance languages]], which also include the historical languages of east-central France and western [[Switzerland]] ([[Arpitania]]), southern France ([[Occitania]]), portions of northern [[Italy]], and the [[Val d'Aran]] in [[Spain]]. 

Linguists divide the [[Romance languages]] of France, and especially of [[Medieval France]], into three geographical subgroups: the first two are ''Langues d'oïl'' and ''[[occitan language|occitan]]'', both named after their words for 'yes' (''oïl'' and ''òc'', respectively), and the third is [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]] (Arpitan).

==Meanings and disambiguation==
{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}
''Langue d'oïl'' (in the singular), ''Oïl dialects'' and ''Oïl languages'' (in the plural) designate the ancient northern Gallo-Romance languages as well as their modern-day descendants. They share many linguistic features, a prominent one being the word ''oïl'' for ''yes''. (''Oc'' was and still is the southern word for ''yes'', hence the ''langue d'oc'' or ''[[Occitan language]]s''). The most widely spoken modern Oïl language is [[French language|French]] (''oïl'' was pronounced {{IPA|[o.il]}} or {{IPA|[o.i]}}, which has become {{IPA-fr|wi|}}, in modern French ''oui'').{{fact|date=May 2017}}

There are three uses of the term ''oïl'':
#Langue d'oïl
#Oïl dialects
#Oïl languages

===Langue d'oïl===
In the singular, Langue d'oïl refers to the mutually intelligible linguistic variants of ''lingua romana'' spoken since the 9th century in northern France and southern Belgium ([[Wallonia]]), since the 10th century in the Channel Islands, and between the 11th and 14th centuries in [[England]] (the [[Anglo-Norman language]]). ''Langue d'oïl'', the term itself, has been used in the singular since the 12th century to denote this ancient linguistic grouping as a whole. With these qualifiers, ''langue d'oïl'' sometimes is used to mean the same as [[Old French]] (see ''History'' below).{{fact|date=May 2017}}

===Oïl dialects===
In the plural, ''Oïl dialects'' refer to the [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of the ancient ''langue d'oïl''.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

===Oïl languages===
In the plural, ''Oïl languages'' refer to those modern-day descendants that evolved separately from the varieties of the ancient ''langue d'oïl''. Consequently, ''langues d'oïl'' today may apply either: to all the modern-day languages of this family ''except'' the French language; or to this family ''including'' French. "''Oïl'' dialects" or "French dialects" are also used to refer to the ''Oïl languages except French''—as some extant Oïl languages are very close to modern French. Because the term ''dialect'' is sometimes considered pejorative, the trend today among French linguists is to refer to these languages as ''langues d'oïl'' rather than ''dialects''.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

==Varieties==
Five zones of Oïl dialects have been proposed:&lt;ref&gt;''Manuel pratique de philologie romane'', Pierre Bec, 1970–1971&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frankish zone (''zone francique'')===
*[[Picard language|Picard]]
*[[Walloon language|Walloon]]
*[[Lorrain language|Lorrain]]
*Northern [[Norman language|Norman]] (spoken north of the [[Joret line]]): including [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]; [[Dgèrnésiais]] (spoken in [[Guernsey]]), [[Jèrriais]] (spoken in Jersey), [[Auregnais]] (spoken in Alderney), [[Sercquiais]] (spoken in Sark)
*[[Champenois language|Eastern Champenois]]

===[[Francien language|Francien]] zone (''zone francienne'')===
*[[French language|Standard French]]
Non-standard varieties:
*[[Orleanais language|Orléanais]]
*[[:fr:Français régional de Touraine|Tourangeau]]
*[[Berrichon]]
*[[Bourbonnais dialects|Bourbonnais]]
*[[Champenois language|Western Champenois]] (or Eastern Francien)

===[[Burgundy (region)|Burgundian]] zone (''zone burgonde'')===

===Development===
''For the history of phonology, orthography, syntax and morphology, see ''[[History of the French language]]'' and the relevant individual Oïl language articles.''

Each of the Oïl languages has developed in its own way from the common ancestor, and division of the development into periods varies according to the individual histories. Modern linguistics uses the following terms:
*9th–13th centuries
**[[Old French]]
**[[Old Norman]]
**etc
*French
**[[Middle French]] for the period 14th–15th centuries
**16th century: ''français [[renaissance]]'' (Renaissance French)
**17th to 18th century: ''français classique'' ([[Classical French]])

==History==
===Romana lingua===
In the 9th century, ''romana lingua'' (the term used in the ''[[Oaths of Strasbourg]]'' of 842) was the first of the Romance languages to be recognized by its speakers as a distinct language, probably because it was the most different from [[Latin]] compared with the other Romance languages (see ''[[History of the French language]]'').{{fact|date=May 2017}}

Many of the developments that we now consider typical of [[Walloon language|Walloon]] appeared between the 8th and 12th centuries. Walloon "had a clearly defined identity from the beginning of the thirteenth century". In any case, linguistic texts from the time do not mention the language, even though they mention others in the Oïl family, such as Picard and Lorrain. During the 15th century, scribes in the region called the language "Roman" when they needed to distinguish it. It is not until the beginning of the 16th century that we find the first occurrence of the word "Walloon" in the same linguistic sense that we use it today.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

===Langue d'oïl===
By late- or post-Roman times [[Vulgar Latin]] within France had developed two distinctive terms for signifying assent (''yes''): ''hoc ille'' ("this (is) it") and ''hoc'' ("this"), which became ''oïl'' and ''oc'', respectively. Subsequent development changed "oïl" into "oui", as in modern French. The term ''langue d'oïl'' itself was first used in the 12th century, referring to the Old French linguistic grouping noted above. In the 14th century, the Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] mentioned the ''yes'' distinctions in his ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]''. He wrote in [[Medieval Latin]]: "''nam alii oc, alii si, alii vero dicunt oil''" ("some say 'oc', others say 'si', others say 'oïl'")—thereby distinguishing at least three classes of Romance languages: ''oc languages'' (in southern France); ''si languages'' (in [[Italy]] and [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]) and ''oïl languages'' (in northern France).{{fact|date=May 2017}}

Other Romance languages derive their word for "yes" from the classical Latin ''sic,'' "thus", such as the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''sì'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''sí'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''sim'', and even [[French language|French]] ''si'' (used when contradicting another's negative assertion). [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] is an exception in that its word for "yes", ''eja'', is from neither origin.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Similarly [[Romanian language|Romanian]] uses ''da'' for "yes", which is of Slavic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dexonline.ro/definitie/da/855336 |title=DA - DEX online |language=Romanian |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, neither ''lingua romana'' nor ''langue d'oïl'' referred, at their respective time, to a single homogeneous language but to [[Mutually intelligible languages|mutually intelligible linguistic varieties]]. In those times, spoken languages in Western Europe were not codified (except Latin and Medieval Latin), the region's population was considerably lower than today, and population centers were more isolated from each other. As a result, mutually intelligible linguistic varieties were referred to as one language.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

===French (Old French/Standardized Oïl) or lingua Gallicana===
In the 13th century these varieties were recognized and referred to as ''dialects'' ("idioms") of a single language, the ''langue d'oïl''. However, since the previous centuries a common literary and juridical "interdialectary" langue d'oïl had emerged, a kind of [[Koiné language|koiné]]. In the late 13th century this common langue d'oïl was named ''French'' (''françois'' in French, ''lingua gallica'' or ''gallicana'' in Medieval Latin). Both aspects of ''"dialects of a same language"'' and ''"French as the common langue d'oïl"'' appear in a text of [[Roger Bacon]], ''[[Opus Majus|Opus maius]]'', who wrote in Medieval Latin but translated thus: "''Indeed, idioms of a same language vary amongst people, as it occurs in the French language which varies in an idiomatic manner amongst the French, [[Picardy|Picards]], [[Normans]] and [[Burgundians]]. And terms right to the Picards horrify the Burgundians as much as their closer neighbours the French"''.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

It is from this period though that definitions of individual Oïl languages are first found. The Picard language is first referred to by name as ''"langage pikart"'' in 1283 in the ''[[Livre Roisin]]''. The author of the ''Vie du bienheureux Thomas Hélye de Biville'' refers to the Norman character of his writing. The ''Sermons poitevins'' of around 1250 show the Poitevin  language developing as it straddled the line between oïl and oc.

As a result, in modern times the term ''langue d'oïl'' also refers to that [[Old French]] which was not as yet named ''French'' but was already—before the late 13th century—used as a literary and juridical ''interdialectary language''.

The term ''[[Francien]]'' is a linguistic [[neologism]] coined in the 19th century to name the hypothetical variant of Old French allegedly spoken by the ''late 14th century'' in the ancient province of ''Pays de France''—the then [[Paris]] region later called ''[[Île-de-France]]''. This ''Francien'', it is claimed, became the Medieval French language. Current linguistic thinking mostly discounts the ''Francien'' theory, although it is still often quoted in popular textbooks. The term ''francien'' was never used by those people supposed to have spoken the variant; but today the term could be used to designate that specific ''10th-and-11th centuries'' variant of langue d'oïl spoken in the Paris region; both variants contributed to the koine, as both were called ''French'' at that time.

===Rise of French (Standardized Oïl) versus other Oïl languages===
For political reasons it was in Paris and Île-de-France that this koiné developed from a written language into a spoken language. Already in the 12th century [[Conon de Béthune]] reported about the French court who blamed him for using words of [[Artois]].

By the late 13th century the written koiné had begun to turn into a [[standard language|spoken and written standard language]], and was named ''French''. Since then French started to be imposed on the other Oïl dialects as well as on the territories of ''langue d'oc''.

However, the Oïl dialects and ''langue d'oc'' continued contributing to the lexis of French.

In the 16th century the French language was imposed even more by the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]] to replace Latin in judgements and official acts and deeds (although the local Oïl languages had always been the language respectively spoken in justice courts). It is argued that the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts was not intended to make French a national language, merely a chancery language for law and administration. Although there were competing literary standards among the Oïl languages in the mediaeval period, the centralisation of the [[Kingdom of France|French kingdom]] and its influence even outside its formal borders sent most of the Oïl languages into comparative obscurity for several centuries. The development of [[literature]] in this new language encouraged writers to use French rather than their own [[regional language]]s. This led to the decline of [[vernacular literature]].

It was the [[French Revolution]] which imposed French on the people as the official language in all the territory. As the influence of French (and in the Channel Islands, English) spread among sectors of provincial populations, cultural movements arose to study and standardise the vernacular languages. From the 18th century and into the 20th century, societies were founded (such as the "Société liégoise de Littérature wallonne" in 1856), dictionaries (such as [[George Métivier]]'s ''Dictionnaire franco-normand'' of 1870) were published, groups were formed and literary movements developed to support and promote the Oïl languages faced with competition. Until the [[World War I|First World War]], the regional [[languages of France]] were still the languages most used in the home and in the fields.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} This was also generally the case in areas where Oïl languages were spoken. French is now the best-known of the Oïl languages.

==Literature==
[[File:Bram Bilo 1890.jpg|thumb|left|The Oïl languages have literary traditions, as for example seen in this 19th-century collection of Jèrriais short stories]]

Besides the influence of [[French literature]], small-scale literature has survived in the other Oïl languages. Theatrical writing is most notable in [[Picard language|Picard]] (which maintains a genre of vernacular [[marionette]] theatre), [[Poitevin (language)|Poitevin]] and [[Saintongeais]]. Oral performance (story-telling) is a feature of [[Gallo language|Gallo]], for example, while [[Norman language|Norman]] and [[Walloon language|Walloon]] literature, especially from the early 19th century tend to focus on written texts and poetry (see, for example, ''[[Wace]]'' and ''[[Jèrriais literature]]'').

As the vernacular Oïl languages were displaced from towns, they have generally survived to a greater extent in rural areas - hence a preponderance of literature relating to rural and peasant themes. The particular circumstances of the self-governing Channel Islands developed a lively strain of political comment, and the early industrialisation in Picardy led to survival of Picard in the mines and workshops of the regions. The mining poets of Picardy may be compared with the tradition of rhyming [[Weaver Poets]] of [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] in a comparable industrial milieu.

There are some regional magazines, such as ''Ch'lanchron'' (Picard), ''Le Viquet'' (Norman), ''Les Nouvelles Chroniques du Don Balleine'' [http://www.societe-jersiaise.org/langsec/chroniques.html] (Jèrriais), and ''El Bourdon'' (Walloon), which are published either wholly in the respective Oïl language or bilingually with French. These provide a platform for literary writing.

==Status==
[[File:Fosses-la-Ville JPG06W.jpg|thumb|Bilingual street sign for ''market square'' in French and [[Walloon language|Walloon]]]]
Apart from French, an official language in many countries (see [[List of countries where French is an official language|list]]), the Oïl languages have enjoyed little status in recent times.

Currently Walloon, [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] (under the local name of ''Gaumais''), and [[Champenois]] have the status of regional languages of [[Wallonia]].

The Norman languages of the Channel Islands enjoy a certain status under the governments of their [[Bailiwick]]s and within the regional and lesser-used language framework of the [[British-Irish Council]]. The [[Anglo-Norman language]], a variant of Norman once the official language of England, today holds mostly a place of ceremonial honor in the United Kingdom (now referred to as ''[[Law French]]'').

The French government recognises the Oïl languages as [[languages of France]], but the [[Constitutional Council of France]] barred ratification of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/a99412dc.pdf Constitutional Council Decision 99-412 DC, European Charter for regional or minority languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
{{Further|Anglo-Norman language}}The ''langues d'oïl'' were more or less influenced by the native languages of the conquering [[Germanic tribes]], notably the [[Franks]]. This was apparent not so much in the vocabulary (which remained overwhelmingly of Latin origin) as in the phonology and syntax; the invading Franks, Burgundians and Normans became the rulers and their accents were imposed as standard on the rest of the population. This accounts in large part for the relative distinctiveness of French compared to other Romance languages.[[File:Bilingual signage-Gallo.jpg|thumb|Signage in [[Gallo language|Gallo]] in the metro of [[Rennes]]]]
The [[English language]] was heavily influenced by contact with Norman following the [[Norman Conquest]] and much of the adopted vocabulary shows typically Norman features.

Portuguese was heavily influenced by more than a millennium of perennial contact with several dialects of both Oïl and [[Occitan language|Occitan]] language groups, in lexicon (up to 15–20% in some estimates, at least 5000 word roots), phonology and orthography.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://oglobo.globo.com/boa-viagem/exposicao-no-museu-da-lingua-portuguesa-mostra-influencia-do-frances-na-nossa-lingua-3125512 Exhibition at the Museum of the Portuguese Language shows the French influence in our language]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://ressources-cla.univ-fcomte.fr/gerflint/Bresil_special2/couto.pdf Contacts between French and Portuguese or the first's influences on the second] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731140340/http://ressources-cla.univ-fcomte.fr/gerflint/Bresil_special2/couto.pdf |date=2013-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.filologia.org.br/revista/40/A%20INFLU%C3%8ANCIA%20DOS%20ESTRANGEIRISMOS.pdf The influence of loanwords in the Portuguese language: a process of globalization, ideology and communication]&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Occitan was, nevertheless, the most marked, through the status Provençal in particular achieved in southwestern Europe around the [[troubadour]] apex in the Middle Ages, when [[Galician-Portuguese lyric]] was developed. Aside the direct influence of Provençal literature, the presence of languages from modern-day France in the Galician-Portuguese area was also strong due to the rule of the [[Portuguese House of Burgundy|House of Burgundy]], the establishment of the Orders of [[Cluniac Reforms|Cluny]] and [[Cistercians|Cister]], the many [[Camino de Santiago (route descriptions)|sections]] of the [[Camino de Santiago|Way of St. James]] pilgrimage route that come from elsewhere in Europe out of the Iberian Peninsula, and the settlement in Iberia of people from the other side of the Pyrenees, arriving during and after the [[Reconquista]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=R51e_6ZUaooC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hwk5MJV3jv&amp;sig=ZjcXoHZ0r61Vi3a5LMEAT06igqc&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KTmIVfXTCveAsQSruK24DQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A língua que falamos: Português, história, variação e discurso] Luiz Antônio da Silva, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altotejo.org/acafa/docsn5/o_occitejano.pdf Occitejano: Sobre a origem occitana do subdialeto do Alto Tejo português] Paulo Feytor Pinto, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lusophobia|anti-Portuguese factor]] of [[Brazilian nationalism]] in the 19th century led to an increased use of the French language in detriment of Portuguese, as France was seen at the time as a model of civilization and progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Barbosa|first= Rosana|authorlink= |title= Immigration and Xenophobia: Portuguese Immigrants in Early 19th Century Rio de Janeiro|url= |accessdate= |year= 2009|publisher= University Press of America|location= United States|isbn= 978-0-7618-4147-0|page= |pages=}}, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The learning of French has historically been important and strong among the Lusophone elites, and for a great span of time it was also the foreign language of choice among the middle class of both Portugal and Brazil, only surpassed in the [[globalization|globalised]] [[postmodernity]] by English, in both, and more recently by [[Spanish language|Spanish]], in the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.gel.org.br/estudoslinguisticos/volumes/37/EL_V37N2_01.pdf The importance of the French language in Brazil: marks and milestones in the early periods of teaching]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://w3.ufsm.br/revistaletras/artigos_r39/artigo39_001.pdf Presence of the French language and literature in Brazil – for a history of Franco-Brazilian bonds of cultural affection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053420/http://w3.ufsm.br/revistaletras/artigos_r39/artigo39_001.pdf |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://revistaescola.abril.com.br/historia/fundamentos/quais-influencias-pensamento-frances-ainda-podem-ser-vistas-brasil-471230.shtml What are the French thinking influences still present in Brazil?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517045650/http://revistaescola.abril.com.br/historia/fundamentos/quais-influencias-pensamento-frances-ainda-podem-ser-vistas-brasil-471230.shtml |date=2015-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.cedep.ifch.ufrgs.br/oanodafrancanobrasilaimportanciadadiplomaciacultural.pdf France in Brazil Year – the importance of cultural diplomacy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Belgian French|French spoken in Belgium]] shows some influence from [[Walloon language|Walloon]].

The development of French in [[North America]] was influenced by the speech of settlers originating from northwestern France, many of whom introduced features of their Oïl varieties into the French they spoke. (See also ''[[French language in the United States]], [[French language in Canada]]'')

'''Malwida von Meysenbug''' (28 October 1816 — 23 April 1903) was a German writer, her work including ''Memories of an Idealist'', the first volume of which she published anonymously in 1869. As well, she was a friend of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Richard Wagner]], and met the French writer [[Romain Rolland]] in Rome in 1890.

Von Meysenbug was born at [[Kassel]], Hesse. Her father Carl Rivalier descended from a family of French [[Huguenots]], and received the title of Baron of Meysenbug from [[William I, Elector of Hesse|William I of Hesse-Kassel]]. The ninth of ten children, she  broke with her family because of her political convictions. Two of her brothers made brilliant careers, one as a [[minister of state]] in Austria, and the other as Minister of the Karlsruhe. Von Meysenbug, however, refused to appeal to her family and lived first by joining a free community in Hamburg, and then by immigrating in 1852 to England where she lived by teaching and translating works. There, she met the republicans [[Ledru-Rollin]], [[Louis Blanc]], and [[Gottfried Kinkel]], all [[political refugee]]s; the young [[Carl Schurz]] also became acquainted with her there.

In 1862 von Meysenbug went to Italy with Olga Herzen, the daughter of [[Alexander Herzen]], known as the "father of Russian socialism" (and whose daughters she taught) and resided there. Olga Herzen married [[Gabriel Monod]] in 1873 and established herself in France, but Malwida's poor health obstructed her from joining her.

Von Meysenbug introduced Nietzsche to several of his friends, including [[Helene von Druskowitz]]. She invited [[Paul Rée]] and Nietzsche to [[Sorrento]], a town which overlooks the bay of [[Naples]], in the autumn of 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Human, All Too Human, Penguin Classics, p.x {{ISBN|978-0-14-044617-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Rée wrote ''The Origins of Moral Sensations'', and Nietzsche began ''[[Human, All Too Human]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Faber, Human All Too Human, Penguin Classics, Introduction p.x&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 von Meysenbug was the first woman ever to be nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] after having been nominated by the French historian [[Gabriel Monod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/sa-ratade-akademien-kvinnorna/av/alan-asaid|title=Så ratade Akademien kvinnorna|first=Alan|last=Asaid|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malwida von Meysenbug died in Rome in 1903 and is buried in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome|Protestant Cemetery]] in the city.

{{Japanese name|Moriyama}}

{{nihongo|'''Moriyama Einosuke'''|森山 栄之助||extra=July 10, 1820 – May 4, 1872}} was a [[samurai]] during the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], and an interpreter of Dutch and English. He studied English under Dutch merchants and [[Ranald MacDonald]]. He was called upon to assist shogunate officials during the "Manhattan Incident" of 1845, during which the American whaling ship [[Manhattan (1843 ship)|''Manhattan'']] approached [[Edo]] to repatriate 22 castaway Japanese seamen. &lt;ref name="Van Zandt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Zandt|first=Howard|title=Pioneer American Merchants in Japan|year=1984|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=9994648144|page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Chief Dutch Interpreter, he was later one of the chief men involved in the negotiations with [[Matthew Calbraith Perry|Commodore Perry]] in regard to the [[sakoku|opening of Japan]] to the outside world.
 
[[Samuel Wells Williams]], a member of Perry's second visit noted in 1854:
{{cquote|A new and superior interpreter came with Saborosuke, named Moriyama Yenosuke&amp;nbsp;... He speaks English well enough to render any other interpreter unnecessary, and this will assist our intercourse greatly. He&amp;nbsp;... asked if Ronald McDonald (sic) was well, or if we knew him.&amp;nbsp;... giving us all a good impression of his education and breeding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6211">'''Moshe Dluznowsky (Dunow)''' (originally '''Mojżesz "Moszek" Dłużnowski''') (1903–1977), [[Yiddish]]-writing journalist, publicist, writer, dramatist, editor of the journal "Tomaszower Wokhenblat".

== Origin and family ==
Born on 22 February (or 9 February according to the Russian [Julianic] calendar) 1903 at 7 a.m. in Tomaszow Rawski (now [[Tomaszow Mazowiecki]] in Poland). He originated from an unpropertied Jewish family. His father Mordka Henokh Dłużnowski (1870–1934) was a small shopkeeper in Tomaszów, who with his wife Estera née Piyus (1870-1942?) created also Yuda Beyer vel Bernard (1894-1942?), a Tomaszowian weaver, Abram (1896–1942), Yuda (born in 1899), Noach and the youngest daughter Sara (born in 1905).

Moshe Dluznowsky (Dunow) married Berta Klebanow in July 1947 in [[New York City]]. Berta was born in [[Minsk]], emigrated to the United States at an early age. She was involved in Yiddish cultural activities and was a teacher.  
Moshe's daughter, Esti Dunow (born in 1948) is a painter and art historian, expert on the work of the painter [[Chaim Soutine]], co-author of the Chaim Soutine Catalogue Raisonne.
Moshe's son Henry Dunow (born in 1953) is a literary agent and co-owner (from 1997) "Dunow, Carlson and Lerner Literary Agency". He wrote a memory on his father and family (see ''The Way Home: Scenes from a Season, Lessons from a Lifetime'', New York  2001).

== Education and journalistic work ==
Moshe was educated in his native Tomaszow. He finished Itzhak Milter's primary Jewish school (kheder), which was a hot-bed for many writers and journalists who wrote their literary works in Yiddish. From 1925 to 1930 he was an editor of the local journal "Tomaszower Wokhenblat", published in Yiddish. He was also a member of the Zionist party "Poale-Zion". In 1930 he left his familiar town and emigrated to France. He settled down in [[Paris]], where his elder brother Abram resided (Abram was arrested in Paris after the Nazi conquest of France and finally was sent to the concentration camp Auschwitz; he died there on 25 April 1942). In Paris Dluznowsky was a correspondent of a number of Jewish journals, e.g. "Parizer Wokhenblat". Before the Nazi conquest of France he left for [[Morocco]] and in 1942 moved to the United States.

== Life and works in U.S.A. ==
There he settled in New York. Moshe Dluznowsky composed numerous novels, essays and theatrical works written in Yiddish. He belonged to the American association of the Jewish writers (Yiddish PEN Club). Moshe Dluznowsky's novels, essays, and art criticism appeared regularly in the New York Yiddish newspaper, [[The Forward]], as well as in periodicals and journals in Paris, [[Buenos Aires]], [[Mexico City]], and [[Israel]]. He maintained contacts with other Jewish writers from Poland, such as [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]. In his book ''Dos Rod fun Mazl'' ("Fortune's wheel", New York 1949, pp.&amp;nbsp;419), written in Yiddish, Moshe Dluznowsky shared interesting recollections of his family's town Tomaszów. He was awarded the Zvi Kessel Literary Prize in 1949.

He published a number of other books in Yiddish: 
* ''A brunem baym veg'' ("A well near the road", Buenos Aires 1953, pp.&amp;nbsp;254),
* ''Harbst in vayngortn: dertseylungen un drames'' ("Autumn in the vineyard: novella and dramas", Buenos Aires 1956, pp.&amp;nbsp;321),
* ''Der Rayvogn'' (Buenos Aires 1958),
* ''Vi a Boim in feld'' ("Like a tree in a field", Buenos Aires 1958, pp.&amp;nbsp;492),
* ''Vintmiln'' ("Windmills", Buenos Aires 1963, pp.&amp;nbsp;560),
* ''Tirn un fentster'' ("Doors and windows", Buenos Aires 1966, pp.&amp;nbsp;228).

Some of his works (e.g. ''Dem tepers tejter'') were published in Spanish (''Las Hijas del alfarero'', Buenos Aires 1959, traducido por Arie Zafrán y Susana R. de Zafrán, pp.&amp;nbsp;503) and in English (''The Potter's Daughter'', London 1959). The most known Dluznowsky's drama ''Der ajnzame szif'' ("The Lonesome Ship") was successfully produced in New York, [[Los Angeles]] (by Maurice Schwartz) and in Ida Kaminska's Jewish Theater in [[Warsaw]] (Polish first performance: June 17, 1961).

He died on July 30, 1977 in New York.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1714">'''Nasometry''' refers to measurement of the modulation of the area of the velopharyngeal opening, using movements of the [[soft palate|velum]] and [[pharynx|pharyngeal]] walls, in speech and singing.  The velopharyngeal opening connects the oral air passageway with the nasal air passageway. The size of this velopharyngeal opening generally controls the [[nasalization|nasality]] of the resulting speech or singing.  

The term nasometry is generally used to refer to non-invasive techniques for measuring the size of the opening, as opposed to [[Endoscopy|endoscopic]] or other visual methods.  During [[vowel]] sounds, nasometry usually refers to the use of a system for measuring [[nasalance]].  During [[consonants]], Nasometry usually refers to the measurement of air escaping past the velum and escaping through the nose. This escaping air is referred to as [[nasal emission]].&lt;ref name="Baken"&gt;R.J. Baken, Robert F. Orlikoff. ''Clinical Measurement of Speech and Voice'' San Diego: Singular, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, a complete system for nasometry consists of a combined nasalance measurement system and nasal emission measurement system.  However, when one or another of these variables is not important, the term nasometry can be used to refer to either measurement of nasalance or nasal emission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3691">'''Negative transference''' is the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] term for the [[transference]] of negative and hostile feelings, rather than positive ones, onto a therapist (or other emotional object).

==Freud's preference==
In his pioneering studies of transference phenomena, [[Freud]] noted the existence of both positive and negative transferences, while expressing a preference for the former, which he initially saw as a prerequisite for analytic work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Malcolm]], ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (1988) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered that "The hostile feelings make their appearance as a rule later than the affectionate ones and behind them";&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; and more frequently in same-sex than in mixed-sex analytic pairings.

[[Otto Fenichel]] pointed out that whereas neurotic aggravations can follow the emergence of a negative transference, so too (paradoxically) can improvements: the patient gets better to spite the therapist for emphasising the patient's problems.&lt;ref&gt;O. Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 559-60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later formulations==
[[Melanie Klein]] in her disputes with [[Anna Freud]] laid much greater emphasis than her opponent on the constructive role to be played by interpreting the negative transference.&lt;ref&gt;C. Frank, ''Melanie Klein in Berlin'' (2009) p. 33-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]] followed her theoretical lead in seeing "the [[Psychological projection|projection]] of what Melanie Klein calls ''bad internal objects''" as key to "the negative transference that is the initial knot of the analytic drama"&lt;ref&gt;J. Lacan, ''Écrits'' (1997) p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; - though he himself would face criticism for glossing over the negative transference in training analyses, to keep his analysands in dependence.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macey, Introduction, J. Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. R. D. Fairbairn]] was also more interested in the negative than the positive transference, which he saw as a key to the [[Repetition compulsion|repetition]] and exposure of unconscious attachments to internalised bad objects.&lt;ref&gt;M. Stark, ''Working with Resistance'' (2002) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; In his wake, [[object relations theory|object relations theorists]] have tended to stress the positive results that can emerge from working with the negative transference.&lt;ref&gt;P. Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 112-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical blocks==
* [[Fritz Wittels]] considered the brevity of [[Wilhelm Stekel]]'s analyses to be due to his [[narcissism]] being unable to endure the emergence of the negative transference.&lt;ref&gt;E. Timms ed., ''Freud and the Child Woman'' (1995) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rollo May]] saw the flaw in [[person-centered therapy]] as a pervasive reluctance to deal with the negative transference.&lt;ref&gt;B. Thorn, ''Carl Rogers'' (1992) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary analogues==
Describing the process of becoming the focus of a paranoid's hostility, [[C. P. Snow]] wrote:

"No one likes being hated: most of us are afraid of it: it jars to the bone when we meet hatred face to face."&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Snow, ''Corridors of Power'' (1975) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3600">'''Overbore''' is a term used to describe firearms cartridges with a relatively large case volume or case capacity coupled with a relatively small diameter bullet.

The case volume or case capacity and barrel bore area can be mathematically related to obtain a case volume to bore area ratio in metric or imperial units.

&lt;math&gt;{O_{ratio}} = \frac{Volume_{case}}{A_{bore}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* Volume&lt;sub&gt;case&lt;/sub&gt; = the cartridge case internal volume or case capacity (in ml or grains of water)
* A&lt;sub&gt;bore&lt;/sub&gt; = barrel bore cross section area (in cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

The higher the O&lt;sub&gt;ratio&lt;/sub&gt; result, the more overbore a cartridge will be. A relatively low O&lt;sub&gt;ratio&lt;/sub&gt; seems to be a good predictor of favorable barrel life and suitability for relatively short barreled weapons. Many [[magnum cartridge]]s feature a relatively high O&lt;sub&gt;ratio&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Quintus Antistius Labeo''' (or ''Pacuvius Antistius Labeo'', died 42 BC) was an [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[jurist]] of the [[Antistia (gens)|gens Antistia]], and one of the murderers of [[Julius Caesar]].

Antistius was one of the disciples of [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]], who are stated by [[Pomponius]] to have written books which were digested by [[Aufidius Namusa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pomponius]], ''Dig.'' 1. tit. 2. s. 2. § 44 (cited by Graves)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the father of the more eminent jurist [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]], who lived under Augustus.

In Antistius' attachment to the ancient republican liberty, he joined the conspiracy of [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and was one of the murderers of Julius Caesar. He was present at the [[Battle of Philippi]] on Brutus's side. After the defeat, he was unwilling to survive Brutus, who, he was told, had pronounced his name with a sigh before his death. Having dug in his tent a hole of the length of his body, he settled his worldly affairs, and sent messages to his wife and children. Then, taking the hand of his most faithful slave, he turned him round (as was usual in the ceremony of [[manumission]]), and, giving him his sword, presented his throat to be stabbed, and was buried in his tent in the hole which he had dug.&lt;ref&gt;Schol. ad Horat. ''Sat.'' i. 3. 83; Plut. ''Brut.'' 12; Appian, ''B. C.'' iv. 135. (cited by Graves)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
The motif involves a character who makes a promise pertaining to love for another character. The first character promises to grant the other his/her love if an impossible wish is granted. Alternately, the first character could promise the second anything he/she asks for in exchange for escape from a life-or-death situation. 

A notable example of the first scenario is [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Franklin's Tale]]", itself partly based on [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Filocolo]]''; Dorigen, a married woman whose husband is absent, promises another suitor that he may have her if she makes the rocks on the coast of Brittany disappear.&lt;ref name="edwards" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clouston|first=W.

An example of the second variation is found in Chaucer's "[[The Wife of Bath's Tale]]", where the main character, a young rapist knight threatened with execution if he cannot answer the question "What do women want?," promises an older woman (the proverbial "[[loathly lady]]") anything she desires if she can provide the answer (she desires to marry him).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Jill|title=Geoffrey Chaucer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlX9B4etMxAC&amp;pg=PR10|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2002|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=9780859916134|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wollock|first=Jennifer G.|title=Rethinking Chivalry and Courtly Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orTn7RpmyZIC&amp;pg=PA169|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780275984885|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''registered envelope''' is a form of [[postal stationery]] consisting of a strong envelope with an [[imprinted stamp]] used for sending [[registered mail]]. The envelopes usually include a perpendicular blue cross and an R in a circle symbol, both internationally recognised symbols of registered mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/postalstationery_20020114/refreshercourse.aspx Postal stationery offers collecting variety by Rick Miller.] Linns.com, 2012. Retrieved 9 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The imprinted stamp (often on the flap) shows the fee for the registration service, while a space is left for a postage stamp to be affixed to pay the postage fee. The envelopes are usually marked ''Registered Letter'' but that term strictly only relates to a normal letter or packet that has extra postage and markings applied so that it may travel under the registered mail service.

Registered envelopes have been widely used throughout Great Britain and the British Commonwealth, but none have been issued in the United States, where registration procedures are different.

Registered envelopes are one of the main types of postal stationery collected by [[Philately|philatelists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3760">'''Segolates''' are words in the [[Hebrew languages|Hebrew language]] whose end is of the form CVCVC, where the [[penult]]imate vowel receives [[syllable stress]].  Such words are called "segolates" because the final unstressed vowel is typically (but not always) [[segol]].  These words evolved from older [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] words that ended with two consonants; indeed, when a suffix (other than an absolute plural) is added to a segolate, the original form (or something similar) reappears (cf. ''kéleḇ'' "dog" vs. ''kalbī'' "my dog").

The ancient forms like ''*CawC'' (such as ''šawr'' "bull") almost universally evolved to non-segolate ''CôC'' (שׁוֹר šôr), though there are exceptions, such as מָוֶת ''māweṯ'' "death".

[[Classical Arabic]] still preserves forms similar to the reconstructed Ancient Hebrew forms, e.g. ''ʼarḍ'' "earth", ''kalb'' "dog", ''ʻayn'' "eye", ''ṣidq'' "sincerity". (Some modern dialects insert an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel between the final two consonants, similar to what happened in Hebrew.

[[File:Bling-Bling Skywriting David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|"[[Bling Bling]]": Dot matrix skywriting over the hamlet of [[Bridgehampton, New York]], August 2006.]]
'''Skywriting ''' is the process of using a small [[aircraft]], able to expel special [[smoke]] during flight, to fly in certain patterns that create [[writing]] readable by someone on the ground. The message is often a frivolous phrase, a generally meaningless greeting, or an [[Aerial advertising|advertisement]] aimed at everyone in the vicinity, a general public display of celebration or goodwill, or a personal message, such as a [[marriage proposal]] or birthday wish.

==Description==
The typical smoke generator consists of a pressurized container holding a low [[viscosity]] oil, such as Chevron/Texaco "Canopus 13", formerly "Corvus Oil". The oil is injected into the hot [[exhaust manifold]], causing it to vaporize into a huge volume of dense, white smoke.

[[Wake turbulence]] and [[wind]] cause dispersal and shearing of the smoke causing the writing to blur and twist, usually within a few minutes. However special "skytyping" techniques have been developed to write in the sky in a [[Dot matrix printing|dot-matrix]] fashion (a new letter every 2–5 seconds instead of every 1–2 minutes), and are legible for longer {{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} than traditional skywriting.

==History==
The beginnings of skywriting are disputed. In a 1926 letter to ''The New York Times'', Albert T. Reid&lt;!--No Wikilink because I cannot tell whether or not this is the cartoonist---&gt; wrote:
:A newspaper paragraph says skywriting was perfected in England in 1919 and used in the United States the next year. But [[Art Smith (pilot)|Art Smith]], who succeeded [[Lincoln Beachey|Beachey]] in flying exhibitions at the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]] in San Francisco in 1915, after the latter had been killed, did skywriting, always ending his breathtaking stunts by writing "Good night." This was not a trial exhibition, but a part of every flight, and was always witnessed by thousands.&lt;ref&gt;"Skywriting in 1915," ''The New York Times,'' October 9th, 1926, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royal Aircraft Factory SE5a ‘G-EBIB’ (19066222815).jpg|thumb|right|''G-EBIB'', one of the S.E.5 former fighter aircraft used for skywriting by Major Jack Savage's company between 1922 and 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/documents/collections/74-A-23-SE5A-F938.pdf |title=INDIVIDUAL HISTORY ROYAL AIRCRAFT FACTORY SE5A F938/G-EBIC/9208M MUSEUM ACCESSION NUMBER 74/A/23 |last=Simpson |first=Andrew |date=2014 |website=RAF Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science Museum, London]], June 2015]]
Major Jack Savage, former British [[Royal Air Force]] pilot and a writer for ''[[Flight International|Flight]]'' magazine, had a successful skywriting fleet of [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]] aircraft in England. He flew throughout the 1920s and 1930s, bringing the practice to America as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Air Trails|date=Winter 1971|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201929.html obituary ''Flight'' 1945]&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use of skywriting for advertising purposes  was over the [[Derby (horse race)|Derby]] at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in May 1922, when Royal Air Force Captain Cyril Turner wrote "''[[Daily Mail]]''" above the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.

However, commercial skywriting in the United States was developed in the early 1930s by Sid Pike, president of the Skywriting Corporation of America in 1932. One of the first major clients was [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]], which used skywriting to reach a mass market. A tremendous number of flights were contracted by Pepsi-Cola, with 2,225 flown in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.

Skywriter Wayne Mansfield flew for John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and he appeared as a sky artist over the Biennale in [[Venice, Italy]]. Artist [[Vik Muniz]] used skywriting for his "cloud cloud" project.

== Skytyping ==

In 1946 the Skywriting Corporation found themselves with a fleet of surplus [[World War II]] planes and developed "dot matrix skywriting", or skytyping.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Coffrin, Pepsi Skywriting pilot&lt;/ref&gt; Skytyping is the process of using five planes in formation to choreograph puffs of smoke being released from each plane. The messages, written at 10,000 foot altitude, can be up to 1250 feet tall and over five miles long. Traditional skywriting letters are 3,000 feet high and take longer to write.

[[File:Eddie Hemmings and Mike Stephenson (27 October 2008).jpg|thumb|right|300px|English commentators [[Eddie Hemmings (rugby league)|Eddie Hemmings]] and [[Mike Stephenson]]]]

In [[Broadcasting of sports events|sports broadcasting]], a '''sports commentator''' (also known as '''sports announcer''', '''sportscaster''' or '''play-by-play announcer''') gives a running commentary of a game or event in [[real time (media)|real time]], usually during a [[live television|live broadcast]], traditionally delivered in the [[historical present]] tense. The comments are normally a [[voiceover]], with the sounds of the action and spectators also heard in the background. In the case of [[television]] commentary, the commentators are on screen rarely if at all during the event (although they may appear on camera at the start or near the end of the broadcast).

==Types of commentators==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}

===Main/play-by-play commentator===
The ''main commentator'', also called the ''play-by-play'' announcer or commentator in North America, ''blow-by-blow'' in combat sports coverage or ''lap-by-lap'' for motorsports coverage, is the primary speaker on the broadcast. Broadcasters in this role are valued for their articulateness and for their ability to describe each play or event of an often fast-moving sporting event. The ideal play-by-play voice has a vocal timbre that is tolerable to hear over the multiple hours of a sports broadcast and yet dynamic enough to convey and enhance the importance of the in-game activity. Because of their skills, some commentators like [[Al Michaels]] in the U.S., [[David Coleman]] in the UK and [[Bruce McAvaney]] in Australia, may have careers in which they call several different sports at one time or another. Other main commentators may, however, only call one sport ([[Mike Emrick]], for example, is known almost exclusively as an [[ice hockey]] broadcaster). The vast majority of play-by-play announcers are male; female play-by-play announcers have not seen sustained employment until the 21st century.

Radio and television play-by-play techniques involve slightly different approaches; radio broadcasts typically require the play-by-play host to say more to verbally convey the on-field activity that cannot be seen by the radio audience. It is unusual to have radio and television broadcasts share the same play-by-play commentator for the same event, except in cases of low production budgets or when a broadcaster is particularly renowned ([[Rick Jeanneret]]'s hockey telecasts, for example, have been simulcast on radio and television since the late 1990s).

===Analyst/color commentator===
{{Main|Color commentator}}

The ''analyst or color commentator'' provides expert analysis and background information, such as statistics, strategy on the teams and athletes, and occasionally anecdotes or light humor. They are usually former athletes or coaches in their respective sports, although there are some exceptions.

The term "color" refers to levity and insight provided by analyst. The most common format for a sports broadcast is to have an analyst/color commentator work alongside the main/play-by-play announcer.&lt;ref&gt;http://inklingmedia.net/2012/05/02/color-commentary-and-play-by-play-a-well-rounded-approach-to-facebook/#.Uk8WfhzN63Y {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116065651/http://inklingmedia.net/2012/05/02/color-commentary-and-play-by-play-a-well-rounded-approach-to-facebook/ |date=2014-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/color-commentator-12656.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsideo.com/blog/johnlund1120/the-business-ofsports/baseball_basketball_football/the-top-three-keys-for-becoming-a-color-commentator-1681.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116082329/http://www.sportsideo.com/blog/johnlund1120/the-business-ofsports/baseball_basketball_football/the-top-three-keys-for-becoming-a-color-commentator-1681.html |archivedate=2014-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' in the United States, which is called by color commentator [[Cris Collinsworth]], a former [[American football]] receiver, and play-by-play commentator [[Al Michaels]], a professional announcer. In the United Kingdom, however, there is a much less distinct division between play-by-play and color commentary, although two-man commentary teams usually feature an enthusiast with formal journalistic training but little or no competitive experience leading the commentary, and an expert former (or current) competitor following up with analysis or summary. There are however exceptions to this — most of the United Kingdom's leading [[cricket]] and [[snooker]] commentators are former professionals in their sports, while the former [[Formula One]] racing commentator [[Murray Walker]] had no formal journalistic training and only limited racing experience of his own. In the United States, [[Pat Summerall|George "Pat" Summerall]], a former professional kicker, spent most of his broadcasting career as a play-by-play announcer.

Although the combination of a play-by-play announcer and a color commentator is standard {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}}, in the past it was much more common for a broadcast to have no analysts and just have a single play-by-play announcer to work alone. [[Vin Scully]], longtime announcer for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn]]/[[Los Angeles Dodgers]] baseball team, was one of the few examples of this practice lasting into the 21st century until he retired in 2016.

===Sideline reporter===
A ''sideline reporter'' assists a sports broadcasting crew with [[sidelines|sideline]] coverage of the [[playing field|playing field or court]]. The sideline reporter typically makes live updates on [[Sports injury|injuries]] and breaking news or conducts player interviews while players are on the field or court because the play-by-play broadcaster and color commentator must remain in their broadcast booth. Sideline reporters are often granted inside information about an important update, such as injury, because they have the credentials necessary to do so. In cases of big events, teams consisting of many sideline reporters are placed strategically so that the main commentator has many sources to turn to (for example some sideline reporters could be stationed in the dressing room area while others could be between the respective team benches).

===Sports presenter/studio host===
In British sports broadcasting, the ''presenter'' of a sports broadcast is usually distinct from the commentator, and often based in a [[remote broadcast]] [[television studio]] away from the sports venue. In North America, the on-air personality based in the studio is called the ''studio host''. During their shows, the presenter/studio host may be joined by additional analysts or pundits, especially when showing highlights of various other matches.

===Other roles===
Various sports may have different commentator roles to cover situations unique to that sport. [[American football]], for example, regularly employs ''rules analysts'' in its broadcasts; usually a former [[Official (American football)|referee]], a rules analyst explains [[Penalty (gridiron football)|penalties]] and controversial calls and dissects [[Replay review in gridiron football|instant replay reviews]] to predict whether a call will or will not be overturned.

===Sportscaster===
In [[North American English]], ''sportscaster'' is a general term for any type of commentator in a sports broadcast. It may also refer to a [[sports talk show]] host or a [[News presenter|newscaster]] covering sports news.

===Shoutcaster===
In [[video game]]s, and particularly [[eSports]], commentators are often called ''shoutcasters''; this term is derived from the free plugin for [[Winamp]] called [[SHOUTcast]], which enabled users to live-stream audio-only feeds across the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/overwatch-videogame-league-aims-to-become-new-nfl/ | title = The Overwatch Videogame League Aims to Become the New NFL | first = Nathan | last = Hill | date = December 7, 2017 | accessdate = December 7, 2017 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While sports broadcasts took place from 1912, Florent Gibson of the ''[[Pittsburgh Star]]'' newspaper broadcast the first sports commentary in April 1921, covering the fight between Johnny Ray and Johnny "Hutch" Dundee at the [[Motor Square Garden]], [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Patterson |first = Ted |title = The Golden Voices of Baseball | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | date = 2002 | page = 12 |isbn = 1-58261-498-9 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Uzh6vqrdzMIC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women==
In 1975, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) made headlines when two coaches from the [[1975 NHL All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game in Montreal]] allowed [[Robin Herman]] and Marcel St. Cyr. access into the men's locker room.  Both were believed to have been the first women ever allowed to enter a professional men's locker room to conduct a post-game interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/the-first-woman-through-the-locker-room-door-35-years-ago/?_r=0|title=The first woman through the locker room door, 35 years ago|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sport organizations began to follow in the NHL's footsteps and allowed for other female sportswriters to be given the same access as men sportswriters.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4061122/ludtke-kuhn-jaguars-colts/|title=This is why female sportswriters can go in men's locker rooms|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the year 1977 when [[Melissa Ludtke]], a sportswriter from ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', was given the assignment to cover the [[New York Yankees]] playoff series but was denied entry into the men's locker room.  [[MLB Commissioner|Baseball commissioner]] [[Bowie Kuhn]] and other officials chose to discriminate against her based on her sex. Knowing that this would put ''Sports Illustrated'' in a disadvantage from other publishers, [[Time Inc.]] and Ludtke filed a lawsuit against Kuhn.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

The lawsuit was taken to the United States District Court in 1978 where Judge [[Constance Baker Motley]] ruled the act as violating the [[14th Amendment of the United States Constitution]]. The court ruled that the Yankees organization devise a plan to protect the players of their privacy while female sportswriters conducted interviews, suggesting the use of towels.&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-09-18/features/8801310839_1_male-sportswriters-locker-room-reporters|title=Suit won entry to locker room|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the access of allowing women in was put into effect, the Yankees organization allowed reporters to spend ten minutes interviewing players and was then asked to leave and wait. Male reporters were unhappy with this and blamed the women from keeping them out and not being able to do their job. For some men they finally understood what women reporters had been dealing with.&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune/&gt;

In 1990, the issue made its way back into the headlines when [[Lisa Olson]] made a public statement revealing that players from the [[New England Patriots]] had exposed themselves while interviews were being conducted.  This prompted other female reporters who had been harassed to come forward.  Accusations were made that women appeared as being "too friendly" while performing interviews or conversing too long with players as though they were flirting.  Their credibility became undermined.  Thus, the issue of sexism was still present, despite the equal access to men's locker rooms.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

==In professional wrestling==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
[[File:JBL, Cole, King.jpg|thumb|right|Professional wrestling commentators [[John "Bradshaw" Layfield]], [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]], and [[Jerry "The King" Lawler]]]]
Though not always the case, in [[professional wrestling]], the color commentator is usually a "[[heel (professional wrestling)|heel sympathizer]]" (or a supporter of the "bad guys") as opposed to the play-by-play announcer, who is more or less the "voice of the fans" as well as supporters of the "good guys" (or [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]]). Though both are supposed to show neutral stance while announcing, the color commentators (especially when they support heels) are usually more blatant about their stance than the play-by-play announcers. [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse "The Body" Ventura]] and [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]] pioneered the "heel sympathizer" for color commentary in wrestling. [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] later made a successful transition into the role, though Lawler has since shown more sympathy for faces (partially due to being [[List of professional wrestling terms#O|over]] with fans after nearly forty years in wrestling). In some cases, commentators are also active [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] for wrestlers, usually following continuity as heels. Former [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] color commentator [[Don Callis|Cyrus]] was known for having dual roles as a heel manager and a somewhat neutral commentator.  Acting as a commentator has also been used to keep injured wrestlers in the public eye while recuperating.  Special guest color commentators serve a two purposes: the primary is usually to place them in position to [[List of professional wrestling terms#I|interfere]] with the match they are calling, the second is to provide promoters with the opportunity to determine if this performer can speak well extemproraneously.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2986">'''Squeeze job''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mms.gov/glossary/sq-sy.htm | publisher=[[Minerals Management Service]] | title=Offshore Minerals Management Glossary SQ-SY | accessdate=January 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''squeeze cementing''' is a term often used in the [[oilfield]] to describe the process of injecting [[cement]] [[slurry]] into a zone, generally for pressure-isolation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=squeeze | publisher=[[Schlumberger]] | title=Oilfield Glossary | accessdate=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Background==
The term probably originated from the concept that enough water is "squeezed" out of the slurry to render it unflowable, so the portion that has actually entered the zone will stay in place when the squeeze pressure is removed.  After surface indications (e.g., pressure reaching a predetermined maximum) that a squeeze has been attained, any still-pumpable cement slurry remaining in the [[drill pipe]] or tubing ideally can be reverse circulated out before it sets.

Usually the zone to be squeezed is isolated from above with a packer (and possibly from below with a bridge plug), but sometimes the squeezing pressure is applied to the entire [[Casing (borehole)|casing]] string in what is known as a '''bradenhead squeeze''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mms.gov/glossary/bo-by.htm | publisher=[[Minerals Management Service]] | title=Offshore Minerals Management Glossary BO-BY | accessdate=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (named for an old manufacturer of [[casing head]]s).

Even if a drilling rig is on location, pumping operations usually are done by a service company's cementing unit that can easily mix small batches of cement slurry, measure displacement volume accurately to spot the slurry on bottom, then pump at very low rates and high pressures during the squeeze itself, and finally measure volumes accurately again when reversing out any excess slurry.  A '''squeeze manifold''' is a compact arrangement of valves and pressure gauges that allows monitoring of the drill pipe and casing pressures throughout the job, and facilitates quick switching of the pumping pressure to either side while the fluid returning from the other side of well is directed to the mud pit or a disposal pit or tank.

The generic term "squeeze" also can apply to injection of generally small volumes of other liquids (e.g., treating fluids) into a zone under pressure.  '''Bullhead squeeze''' (or just plain [[bullheading]]) refers to pumping kill-weight [[Drilling mud|mud]] down the casing beneath closed [[blowout preventer]]s in a [[Blowout (well drilling)|kick-control]] situation when it isn't feasible to circulate in such from bottom.

'''Standard manuscript format''' is a formatting style for manuscripts of short stories, novels, poems and other literary works. Even with the advent of [[desktop publishing]], making it possible for anyone to prepare text that appears professionally [[typesetting|typeset]], many publishers still require authors to submit manuscripts within their respective guidelines. Although there is no single set of guidelines, the "standard" format describes formatting that is considered to be generally acceptable.&lt;ref name="Shunn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shunn|first1=William|title=Proper Manuscript Format|journal= Writers Write: The Internet Writing Journal|date=December 1998|url=http://www.shunn.net/format/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although publishers guidelines for formatting are the most critical resource for authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Formatting and Submitting your Manuscript|edition= 3rd|last1= Sambuchino|first1= Chuck |last2= The Editors of Writer's Digest Books|year= 2009|publisher= Writer's Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, OH|isbn= 978-1-58297-571-9|pages=5, 10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[style guide]]s are also key references for authors preparing manuscripts since "virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Punctuation: A Handy Reference to Resolve All Your Grammatical Problems|last= Stevenson|first=Jay|year=2005|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-1-59257-393-6|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscript formatting depends greatly on the type of work that is being written, as well as the individual publisher, editor or producer. Writers who intend to submit a manuscript should determine what the relevant writing standards are, and follow them. Individual publishers' standards will take precedence over [[style guide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Formatting and Submitting your Manuscript|edition= 3rd|last1= Sambuchino|first1= Chuck |last2= The Editors of Writer's Digest Books|year= 2009|publisher= Writer's Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, OH|isbn= 978-1-58297-571-9|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

Writers can add the [[word count]] of the manuscript, although this may also be noted on a [[query letter]]. Most publishers pay writers based on a hypothetical number of words in the manuscript. However, this is not the physical count of actual words; this is a rough count of the number of characters divided to better estimate the space that the final text will consume in the published version. Normally, this involves counting every character in the manuscript, including spaces, and dividing by 6. If the correct font size is used, and if the [[Margin (typography)|margins]] are set so that lines contain an average of 60 characters, the editor can easily assume that there are 10 words per line. Furthermore, if the top and bottom margins are set so that there are, for example, 20 lines on each page, the editor can easily count 250 words per page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.davidfarland.net/writing_tips/?a=230|title = The Importance of Standard Manuscript Format|date = 2013-06-18|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Splane/&gt;&lt;ref name=www.aw-bc.com/&gt;

==Manuscript handling==
The final reason involves how editors, copy editors, and typesetters handle manuscripts. They might work on an entire manuscript at one time or the editor might hand groups of pages to the typesetter at a time. Unstapled pages facilitate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://homeschoolmagazinereviews.com/en/dissertation-writing-process|title = Dissertation Writing Process|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Suleyman Rustam was born on November 27, 1906 in [[Novxanı]] village in family of a blacksmith.

He studied at [[Russian language|Russo]]-[[Tatar language|Tatar]] school until revolution. Suleyman Rustam wrote that, [[Suleyman Sani Akhundov]], who was the headmaster and pedagogue at the school evoked his interest to literature and such famous pedagogues as M.Vezirov, R.Tahirov and A.Israfilbeyli strengthened this interest. After he entered [[Baku]] Electric Technical School and then to the eastern faculty of [[Baku State University]] where his classmates were [[Jafar Jabbarly]], [[Afrasiyab Badalbeyli|A.Badalbeyli]], V.Khuluflu and was  taught by such pedagogue as the eminent writer [[Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 1929, Suleyman Rustam continued his education at the faculty of literature and arts of [[Moscow State University]]. From 1937, he worked as a chairman of [[Azerbaijan State Academic Drama Theatre]] named after [[Meshadi Azizbekov|M.Azizbekov]]. He was the deputy of all convocations of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Soviet Parliament]] of Azerbaijan and from 1971 till 1989 he was the chairman of [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR]]. Suleyman Rustam was not only the poet, he also was a translator and a literary man. He translated works of [[Ivan Krylov|I.A.Krylov]], [[Aleksander Griboyedov|A.S.Griboyedov]], [[Alexander Pushkin|A.S.Pushkin]], [[Mikhail Lermontov|M.Y.Lermontov]], [[Nikolay Nekrasov|N.A.Nekrasov]] and others into his native language. Suleyman Rustam's works were translated into many languages of the world and also into Russian.

Rustam worked as a chief editor of "Edebiyyat qazeti" ("Literature newspaper"). He was the laureate of many prestigious premiums of Azerbaijan and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].

Suleyman Rustam died on June 10, 1989 and was buried in the [[Alley of Honor]] in Baku.

==Creativity==
His first collection of poems, "From sadness to happiness", written in 1927, was dedicated to Komsomol, civil war, courage of soldiers struggling for the Soviet power, as other poems of the poet, written in 1920's ("Partisan Ali", "Armless hero").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The main theme of his works, created in 1930's ("Romanticism of a night"), was the creation of romanticism of a collective work, attracting spiritual enrichment of people. "A good comrade" poem was dedicated to labor feats of cotton growers in Mugham steppes. In 1939-1940's, S.Rustam wrote "Qachaq Nebi" novel. The poet used folk proverbs about Qachaq Nebi, expanded and deepened them socially and historically, gave a social perception to the novel. Main heroes of the novel are Qachaq Nebi - a famous leader of the national movement of the 19th century and Hejer - his brave wife and fellow fighter.

Nebi, the son of a poor peasant, working as a farm laborer at bey, didn't bear cruelty and rudeness of his master and run to mountains and became "qachaq" (fugitive). He assembled dissatisfied peasants around him, vengeance for outraged people, took away money and commodities from the rich and gave them to the poor. He was supported by the whole neighborhood and courageously opposed tsar officers and gendarme and kept day-laborers in awe for a long time.  And "noble brigand" Nebi's revolt was also collapsed as every spontaneous peasant struggle.

Patriotic poems ("A day will come", "To the sons of Azerbaijan", "Old man's answer") written during the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]] were dedicated to bravery and selflessness of the Soviet people, their unshakeable belief and victory over the enemy. Suleyman Rustam's "Mother and a postman" poem had a great fame (1942).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Сулейман Рустам| url =http://bse.chemport.ru/sulejman_rustam.shtml| publisher =| date =| accessdate =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150418130354/http://bse.chemport.ru/sulejman_rustam.shtml| archivedate =2015-04-18| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mother waiting for news from his front-line soldier son for four months says the postman: "If there is not any letter for me…don't come here again!" Disappointed postman goes away, but he is not offended, he is distressed by sufferings of the old mother. In her turn mother also regrets for her action. Finally, the postman brings a long-awaited letter and the postman and the whole neighborhood rejoices at the mother's happiness. This poem, written with a great emotional strength, deeply excites a reader and evokes his heartwarming feelings.

During the postwar times the poet wrote a collection of poems called "Two shores", dedicated to hard life of Azerbaijani paupers in Iran and postwar flourishing of the Soviet Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''Toilet humour''' or '''scatological humour''' is a type of [[off-colour humour]] dealing with [[defecation]], [[urination]] and [[flatulence]], and to a lesser extent [[vomiting]] and other body functions. It sees substantial crossover with sexual humour, such as [[dick joke]]s.

Toilet humour is popular among a wide range of ages,&lt;ref&gt;For example, David Alperts (who is no spring chicken) is commonly considered this humor forms number one fan.&lt;/ref&gt; but is especially popular with children and teenagers, for whom cultural [[taboo]]s related to acknowledgement of waste excretion still have a degree of novelty. The humour comes from the rejection of such taboos, and is a part of modern culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Poop-Culture-America-Grossest-National/dp/193259521X Poop Culture: How America is Shaped by its Grossest National Product] by Dave Praeger {{ISBN|1-932595-21-X}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples can also be found in earlier literature, including ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].

==Song==
Toilet humour is also found in song and rhyme, particularly schoolboy songs. Examples of this are found in [[Mozart and scatology]], and variants of the German folk schoolboys' song known as the ''Scheiße-Lied'' (English: "Shit-Song")&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Fischer ''Kinderreime im Ruhrgebiet: Reime, Lieder, Spiellieder'' 1991 Page 121  "Scheiße auf der Kirchturmspitze Fällt demll Pastor auf die Mütze. 2. Scheiße in der Lampenschale Gibt gedämpftes Licht im Saale. 951 . Scheiße auf dem Autodach Liegt bei Hundertachtzig flach. 952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Profil'' 1994 - Volume 25 - Page 58 "Immer, wenn es besonders ausgelasse zuging, stimmten meine Mitschüler in einem katholischen Internat das „Scheiße"-Lied an: „Scheiße auf dem Autodach, eladiladijo, liegt bei 180 flach. Und wie das Amen im Gebet kam dann auch jene ..."&lt;/ref&gt; which is indexed in the German ''Volksliederarchiv''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.volksliederarchiv.de/alte-kinderreime/scheisse/ Volksliederarchiv: Scheiße]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Words in Colour''' is an approach to literacy invented by Dr [[Caleb Gattegno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Eight Hours to Literacy|author=Brenda Hopkin|work=Schools and College|date=November 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Words in Colour first appeared in 1962, published simultaneously in the UK and US.  Later versions were published in French (''{{Lang-fr|Lecture en Couleurs}}'') and Spanish (''{{Lang-es|Letras en Color}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Words in Colour Catalogue|date=1973|publisher=The Cuisenaire Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words in Colour is a [[synthetic phonics]] system that uses colour to indicate the [[phonetic]] properties of letters.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Stringer, Bobrow and Linn|editor=Peggy L.

'''Iyasa''' (Yasa, Yassa) is a [[Bantu language]] of [[Cameroon]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]] by [[Ndowe]] coastal fishing people. It is also spoken by [[Pygmies]], perhaps [[Babongo]], in [[Gabon]].

Iyasa also goes by the names Bongwe, Lyaasa, and Maasa. Dialects are ''Bweko, Vendo, Bodele, Marry, One, Asonga, Bomui, Mogana, Mooma, Mapanga''. It may in turn be a dialect of [[Kombe language|Kombe]]. Speakers report that Kombe and Iyasa are almost perfectly mutually intelligible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Syntagme Nominal du Yasa|last=Bouh Ma Sitna|first=Charles Lwanga|publisher=University of Yaoundé I: Master's thesis|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Dieu and Renaud (1993) classify Iyasa as a Sawabantu language (A.30 in Guthrie classification).&lt;ref&gt;Dieu, Michel, and Patrick Renaud. 1993. ''Situation linguistique en Afrique centrale, inventaire pre@liminaire: Le Cameroun.'' In Atlas Linguistique du Cameroun. Yaounde@: ACCT-CERDOTOLA-DGRST.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic Distribution ==
Iyasa is spoken along the coast of Cameroon south of [[Kribi]], including in the city of [[Campo, Cameroon|Campo]]. It is also spoken across the Ntem River in Equatorial Guinea.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bôt|first=Dieudonné Martin Luther|year=2011|title=Le Préfixe Nominale Yasa|url=|journal=Journal of West African Languages|volume=38 |issue=1|pages=99–122|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northernmost Iyasa village is Lolabe, 31&amp;nbsp;km south of Kribi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
