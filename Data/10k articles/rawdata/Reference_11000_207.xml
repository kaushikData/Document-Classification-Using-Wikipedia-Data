The '''2016 Democratic National Committee email leak''' is a collection of [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) emails [[Democratic National Committee cyber attacks|stolen]] by one or more hackers operating under the pseudonym "[[Guccifer 2.0]]" who are  alleged to be Russian intelligence agency hackers, according to indictments carried out by the Mueller investigation.&lt;ref name=CNNHackIndictment&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These emails were subsequently published ([[Internet leak|leaked]]) by [[DCLeaks]] in June and July 2016&lt;ref name=AP2017-11-04&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Satter | first1 = Raphael | last2 = Donn | first2 = Jeff | last3 = Day | first3 = Chad | title = Inside Story: How Russians Hacked the Democrats' Emails: How did Russian hackers pry into Clinton campaign emails?

WikiLeaks did not reveal its source.

On December 9, 2016, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] told U.S. legislators that the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] concluded Russia conducted operations during the 2016 U.S. election to prevent Hillary Clinton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4422723/putin-russia-hillary-clinton/|title=Why Putin Has an Electoral Bone to Pick With Hillary Clinton|first=Simon Shuster /|last=Berlin|website=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; from winning the presidency.&lt;ref name=secretcia /&gt; Multiple U.S intelligence agencies concluded people with direct ties to the [[Kremlin]] gave [[WikiLeaks]] hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee.&lt;ref name=secretcia /&gt;

In June 2017, former Secretary of [[Homeland Security]] [[Jeh Johnson]], who was appointed by and served under [[President Barack Obama]], testified before a House Select committee that his department offered their assistance to the DNC during the campaign to determine what happened to their server, but said his efforts were "rebuffed" because the DHS was offering to provide assistance months after the FBI had provided assistance.&lt;ref name=WT&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/5/dnc-email-server-most-wanted-evidence-for-russia-i/|accessdate=July 5, 2017|date=July 5, 2017|publisher=[[The Washington Times]]|title=Hacked computer server that handled DNC email remains out of reach of Russia investigators}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Politico&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/22/dnc-russian-hacking-homeland-security-239866|accessdate=May 20, 2018|date=June 22, 2017|publisher=[[Politico]]|title=DNC: The Russians had been booted from our system by the time DHS called}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of leak==
The leaked emails revealed information about the DNC's interactions with the media, Hillary Clinton's and Bernie Sanders' campaigns, and financial contributions. It also includes personal information about the donors of the Democratic Party, including credit card and [[Social Security number]]s, which could facilitate [[identity theft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Kieren|title=WikiLeaks fights The Man by, er, publishing ordinary people's personal information|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/22/wikileaks_keep_fighting_the_man_by_er_publishing_the_personal_details_of_ordinary_citizens/|website=The Register|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PetersonClash"&gt;Andrea Peterson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/07/28/a-twitter-spat-breaks-out-between-snowden-and-wikileaks/ Snowden and WikiLeaks clash over leaked Democratic Party emails], ''Washington Post'' (July 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2016, Guccifer 2.0 instructed reporters to visit the DCLeaks website for emails stolen from Democrats.&lt;ref name=AP2017-11-04/&gt; With the WikiLeaks disclosure of additional stolen emails beginning on July 22, 2016, more than 150,000 stolen emails from either personal Gmail addresses or via the DNC that were related to the [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Hillary Clinton 2016 Presidential campaign]] were published on the DCLeaks and WikiLeaks websites. On August 12, 2016, DCLeaks released information about more than 200 Democratic lawmakers, including their personal cellphone numbers.&lt;ref name="DuVall"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/08/13/Suspected-Russian-hackers-release-lawmakers-personal-information/1671471109735/|title=Suspected Russian hackers release lawmakers' personal information|last=DuVall|first=Eric|date=August 13, 2016|website=upi.com|publisher=[[United Press International]]|access-date=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numerous [[crank calls]] that [[Hillary Clinton]] received from this disclosure along with the loss of her campaign's email security caused a very severe disruption of her campaign which subsequently changed their contact information on October 7, 2016, by calling each of her contacts one at a time.&lt;ref name="AP2017-11-04"/&gt;

===Media===
The emails include DNC staff's "off-the-record" correspondence with media personalities, including the reporters at [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/289126-todd-tapper-respond-to-being-named-in-leaked-wikileaks|title=Todd, Tapper respond to being named in leaked WikiLeaks DNC emails|last=Joe|first=Concha|date=July 25, 2016|website=[[The Hill (newspaper)]]|publisher=|access-date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/07/24/wikileaks-emails-pro-clinton-cnn-political-commentator-pre-checked-op-ed-with-dnc/|title=WikiLeaks emails: Pro-Clinton CNN political commentator pre-checked op-ed with DNC|last=Wemple|first=Erik|date=July 24, 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/25/us/politics/media-democratic-national-committee-emails.html|title=Ego Clashes Exposed in Leaked Emails From Democratic National Committee|last=Grynbaum|first=Michael M.|date=July 24, 2016|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=July 27, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Politico]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and the ''[[Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="CBS_SFBay_off"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/07/22/hilary-leaks-wikileaks-releases-democratic-national-committee-emails/ |title=WikiLeaks' DNC Email Leak Reveals Off The Record Media Correspondence |date=July 22, 2016 |publisher=SanFrancisco.cbslocal.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bernie Sanders' campaign===
In the emails, DNC staffers derided the Sanders campaign.&lt;ref name="ShearDerided"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/us/politics/dnc-emails-sanders-clinton.html|title=Released Emails Suggest the D.N.C. Derided the Sanders Campaign|last=Shear|first=Michael|date=July 22, 2016|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported: "Many of the most damaging emails suggest the committee was actively trying to undermine Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign. Basically, all of these examples came late in the primary—after Hillary Clinton was clearly headed for victory—but they belie the national party committee's stated neutrality in the race even at that late stage."&lt;ref name=Here_are_the_latest&gt;{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Blake |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/24/here-are-the-latest-most-damaging-things-in-the-dncs-leaked-emails/ |title=Here are the latest, most damaging things in the DNC's leaked emails|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=July 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2016 email chain, the DNC [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) Brad Marshall told the DNC chief executive officer, Amy Dacy, that they should have someone from the media ask Sanders if he is an atheist prior to the [[West Virginia Democratic primary, 2016|West Virginia primary]].&lt;ref name="Here_are_the_latest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/dnc-emails-wikileaks-hillary-bernie-sanders|title=Leaked DNC emails reveal details of anti-Sanders sentiment|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2016|work=|newspaper=The Guardian|agency=Associated Press|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2016, DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach sent an email to DNC Spokesman Luis Miranda mentioning a controversy that ensued in December 2015, when the National Data Director of the Sanders campaign and three subordinate staffers accessed the Clinton campaign's voter information on the [[NGP VAN]] database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Maggie |last1=Haberman |first2=Nick |last2=Corasanti |url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/18/sanders-campaign-disciplined-for-breaching-clinton-data/?_r=1 |title=Democrats and Bernie Sanders Clash Over Data Breach |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The party accused Sanders' campaign of impropriety and briefly limited their access to the database. The Sanders campaign filed suit for breach of contract against the DNC;  they dropped the suit on April 29, 2016.)&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Jacobs, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/18/democrats-punish-bernie-sanders-campaign-following-clinton-data-breach Democrats punish Bernie Sanders campaign following Clinton data breach], ''Guardian'' (December 18, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Wagner |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/29/sanders-campaign-drops-lawsuit-against-dnc-stemming-from-december-data-breach-flap// |title=Sanders campaign drops lawsuit against DNC stemming from December data-breach flap|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paustenbach suggested that the incident could be used to promote a "narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never had his act together, that his campaign was a mess." (The suggestion was rejected by the DNC.) &lt;ref name=Here_are_the_latest/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; ''The Washington Post'' wrote: "Paustenbach's suggestion, in that way, could be read as a defense of the committee rather than pushing negative information about Sanders. But this is still the committee pushing negative information about one of its candidates."&lt;ref name=Here_are_the_latest/&gt;

===Debbie Wasserman Schultz's emails===

===Financial and donor information===
According to ''The New York Times'', the cache included "thousands of emails exchanged by Democratic officials and party fund-raisers, revealing in rarely seen detail the elaborate, ingratiating and often bluntly transactional exchanges necessary to harvest hundreds of millions of dollars from the party's wealthy donor class.

In 2011 France, under Sarkozy, led calls for international intervention in the [[Libyan Civil War]], voted in favor of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] and, subsequently, dispatched the [[French Air Force]] into direct military action in Libya in support of the [[National Transitional Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=Michael|title=Viewpoint: How Libya Became a French and British War|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2060412,00.html|accessdate=March 20, 2018|work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]|date=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, France explained the move was to protect Libyan civilians, however, in a private email from [[Sidney Blumenthal]] to [[Hillary Clinton]] - revealed as part of the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak - Blumenthal claimed France was more concerned with Libya's large gold reserves which might pose a threat to the value of the [[Central African Franc]], thereby displacing French influence in [[Africa]], and that Sarkozy was interested in gaining more ready access to Libyan oil.

==Reactions==
On July 18, 2016, [[Dmitry Peskov]], press secretary for Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], stated that the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]] had no involvement in the DNC hacking incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/07/18/hacker-guccifer-2-0-claims-new-dnc-data-leak.html|title=Hacker Guccifer 2.0 claims new DNC data leak|last=|first=|date=July 18, 2016|publisher=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peskov called it "paranoid" and "absurd",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/amid-fbi-probe-russia-denies-it-hacked-democrats-emails/a-19428426 |title=Amid FBI probe Russia denies it hacked Democrats' emails |date=July 26, 2016|work=[[Deutsche Welle]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying: "We are again seeing these maniacal attempts to exploit the Russian theme in the US election campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-27/kremlin-says-idea-it-hacked-us-democratic-party-emails-absurd/7663558 |title= Kremlin dismisses US Democratic email hack claims as 'absurd' and an 'old trick' |date=July 26, 2016|work=ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; That position was later reiterated by the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC, which called the allegation "entirely unrealistic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interfax.com/newsinf.asp?pg=7&amp;id=690419|title=Media claims of Moscow's attempts to interfere in U.S. presidential campaign progress unfounded - Russian Embassy - Interfax|last=|first=|date=|website=www.interfax.com|publisher=[[Interfax]]|access-date=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I sat in that chair in [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004 trying to navigate all the different candidates we had]].

On July 25, 2016, Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter for the BBC, commented that "the revelation that those in the heart of the Democratic establishment sought to undermine the anti-establishment Sanders is roughly on a par with [''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' character] police Capt Renault's professed shock that gambling was taking place in the Casablanca club he was raiding, as a waiter hands him his winnings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2016-36879197|title=US election: Email row claims Debbie Wasserman Schultz|publisher=BBC News|date=July 25, 2016|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2016, Republican National Committee chairman [[Reince Priebus]] said that "Today's events show really what an uphill climb the Democrats are facing this week in unifying their party. Starting out the week by losing your party chairman over longstanding bitterness between factions is no way to keep something together." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/priebus-manafort-republican-wasserman-schultz-dnc|title=Priebus and Manafort seize on Wasserman Schultz DNC resignation|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the emails were released, the Australian diplomat [[Alexander Downer]] informed the U.S. government that, in May 2016 at a London wine bar, Trump campaign staffer [[George Papadopoulos]] had told him that the Russian government had a large trove of [[Hillary Clinton]] emails that could potentially damage her presidential campaign. The FBI started a [[counterintelligence]] investigation into possible [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html|title=How the Russia Inquiry Began: A Campaign Aide, Drinks and Talk of Political Dirt|last=LaFraniere|first=Sharon|date=December 30, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 30, 2017|last2=Mazzetti|first2=Mark|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=Apuzzo|first3=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Trump-Russia inquiry: Australian PM denies US relationship damaged by Downer report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/01/trump-russia-inquiry-australia-malcolm-turnbull-denies-relationship-damaged-alexander-downer-george-papadopoulos|date=January 1, 2018|last=Remeikis|first=Amy|access-date=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 2016, NBC News reported that multiple sources were telling them that Barack Obama had ordered the CIA to present him with options for a retaliatory cyber attack against the Russian Federation for allegedly interfering in the US presidential election. Sources said that this is not the first time the CIA has presented such options to a president, but that on all previous occasions the decision was made not to carry out the proposed attacks.&lt;ref name="Retaliation1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arkin|first1=William M.|last2=Dilanian|first2=Ken|last3=Windrem|first3=Robert|title=CIA Prepping for Possible Cyber Strike Against Russia|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cia-prepping-possible-cyber-strike-against-russia-n666636|accessdate=October 15, 2016|agency=NBC News|publisher=NBC News|date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an op-ed for ''The Intercept'', [[James Risen]] chided the media for its lopsided reporting on emails:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2018/02/16/trump-russia-election-hacking-investigation/|title=Is Donald Trump a Traitor?|last=Risen|first=James|date=February 16, 2018|website=The Intercept|language=en-US|access-date=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To their disgrace, editors and reporters at American news organizations greatly enhanced the Russian echo chamber, eagerly writing stories about Clinton and the Democratic Party based on the emails, while showing almost no interest during the presidential campaign in exactly how those emails came to be disclosed and distributed ... The hack was a much more important story than the content of the emails themselves, but that story was largely ignored because it was so easy for journalists to write about Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Media coverage and public perception==
The ''New York Times'' reported that Julian Assange stated in an interview on British ITV on June 12, 2016, that he hoped that the publication of the emails would " ... harm Hillary Clinton's chances to win the presidency…" and that he had timed the release to coincide with the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]],&lt;ref name= "SpyAgencyConsensus"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/assange-timed-wikileaks-release-of-democratic-emails-to-harm-hillary-clinton.html Assange, Avowed Foe of Clinton, Timed Email Release for Democratic Convention,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; even though the interview in question contains neither statement by Assange. In an interview with CNN, Assange would neither confirm nor deny who WikiLeaks' sources were; he claimed that his website " ... might release "a lot more material" relevant to the US electoral campaign ... " &lt;ref&gt;"[http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/26/politics/julian-assange-dnc-email-leak-hack/ Julian Assange: 'A lot more material' coming on US elections]". CNN. July 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of the stolen emails, NSA whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] criticized WikiLeaks for its wholesale leakage of data, writing that "their hostility to even modest curation is a mistake."&lt;ref name="PetersonClash"/&gt; The ''Washington Post'' contrasted the difference between WikiLeaks' practices and Snowden's disclosure of information about NSA: while Snowden worked with journalists to vet documents (withholding some where it would endanger national security), WikiLeaks' "more radical" approach involves the dumping of "massive, searchable caches online with few—if any—apparent efforts to remove sensitive personal information."&lt;ref name="PetersonClash"/&gt;

On July 25, 2016, [[Anne Applebaum]], columnist for the ''Washington Post'', writes that

&lt;blockquote&gt;… with the exception of a few people on Twitter and a handful of print journalists, most of those covering this story, especially on television, are not interested in the nature of the hackers, and they are not asking why the Russians apparently chose to pass the emails on to WikiLeaks at this particular moment, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. They are focusing instead on the content of what were meant to be private emails ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

She goes on to describe in detail other [[Active measures|Russian destabilization campaigns in Eastern European countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anne|first1=Applebaum|title=Connecting the dots: How Russia benefits from the DNC mail leaks|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/07/25/connecting-the-dots-how-russia-benefits-from-the-dnc-email-leak/|date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2016, Thomas Rid, Professor in Security Studies at King's College, London, and non-resident fellow at the School for Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University, in Washington, DC, summed up the evidence pointing to Russia being behind the hacking of the DNC files and the "Guccifer-branded leaking operation".  He concludes that these actions successfully blunted the "DNC's ability to use its opposition research in surprise against Trump ... " &lt;ref name= "Rid"/&gt;  He further writes that data exfiltration from political organizations is done by many countries and is considered to be a legitimate form of intelligence work. "But digitally exfiltrating and then publishing possibly manipulated documents disguised as freewheeling hacktivism is crossing a big red line and setting a dangerous precedent: an authoritarian country directly yet covertly trying to sabotage an American election."&lt;ref name="Rid"/&gt;

Russian security expert and investigative journalist [[Andrei Soldatov]] said "It is almost impossible to know for sure whether or not Russia is behind a hack of the DNC's servers". According to him, one of the reasons Russia would try to sway the US presidential election is that the Russian government considers Clinton "a hater of Russia": "There is this mentality in Russia of being besieged; that it is always under attack from the United States ... They are trying to interfere in our internal affairs so why not try to do the same thing to them?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/pro-kremlin-youth-groups-could-be-behind-dnc-hack/a-19430216 |title='Pro-Kremlin youth groups' could be behind DNC hack|date=July 27, 2016|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil DNC lawsuit==
{{Main|Democratic National Committee v. Russian Federation}}
On April 20, 2018, the Democratic National Committee filed a civil lawsuit in federal court in New York, accusing the Russian government, the Trump campaign, Wikileaks, and others of conspiracy to alter the course of the 2016 presidential election and asking for monetary damages and a declaration admitting guilt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5367">The '''A.L.A. Catalog''' is the first general book selection guide cooperatively prepared for use by American [[public libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;Wayne A. Wiegand. “Catalog of ‘ALA’ Library (1893): Origins of a Genre” in For the Good of the Order: Essays in Honor of Edward G. Holley(peer reviewed), edited by Delmus E. Williams et al. (Greenwich, Conn.: JAI Press, 1994) 237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the early stage of public libraries’ development, book selection is the job of library committee composed of library director and trustees rather than librarians. However, there might be problems for the committee to reach an agreement on which book should be include/exclude for their libraries due to the following two reasons: Firstly, the committee members might be different in terms of education background and personal interests, therefore, they might come up with “different theories of what the library shall be”. Secondly, even without the disagreement of theories, it is impossible for committee members to have an adequate knowledge of “books, editions, and prices, outside of their own line of reading.” Thus they need the assistance from experts to revise and complete their booklist for libraries.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Poole, “Selection of Books”, in Public Libraries in the United States of America; their history, condition, and management. Special report. Part I, United States. Department of the interior, Bureau of Education (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1876), 479-783.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dewey and the Catalog==
The A.L.A. Catalog, also known as the Catalog of A.L.A. Library, as one of the most popular booklists developed by experts, is the “first general book selection guide cooperatively prepared for use by American public libraries.”&lt;ref&gt;Wayne A. Wiegand: 237-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the development of the catalog, [[Melvil Dewey]] first promoted the idea of a universal library collection guide in an article “The Coming Catalogue” in [[Library Journal]] in 1877. He suggested a co-operative way for creating the collection guide among library committee, field specialist, as well as authors, for the reason that “no one person living unites in himself the wisdom necessary to make the best notes on all the books of the library”, and “not one but many minds must contribute to the work [of book selection].” Dewey also suggested [[American Library Association]] (A.L.A) appoints a committee to take “entire charge” of the “coming catalogue”. The primary usage of such catalogue would be “as a guide in the purchase of books for either private or public collection; as the main catalog of many of these libraries.”&lt;ref&gt;Melvil Dewey, “The Coming Catalogue,” Library Journal 1 (August, 1877): 423-427.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on Dewey’s article, A.L.A. began to take steps of creating such catalog. In November 1878, A.L.A. appointed five people as the committee in charge of the catalog. They decided to adopt a classified arrangement of the catalog. The catalog was planned to be about 250 pages with a fixed price of $2.50.&lt;ref&gt;Library Journal 3 (November, 1878): 331.&lt;/ref&gt; After years’ cession of catalog development, Dewey attempted to restart his plan for A.L.A. catalog when he worked at [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] as the “Librarian in Chief” in 1883. He tried to obtain suggestion from Columbia faculty members through their lectures on “bibliography and literature in their areas of expertise” when the School of Library Economy was established in 1887, and later Dewey moved to [[University of the State of New York]] in 1888, where he continued his work on catalog by asking his library employees and students in Albany to compile the catalog through scholarly journals. The Catalog was finally published and promoted in the A.L.A. annual conference in 1893 at the Chicago World’s Fair. The 1893 Catalog of A.L.A. library provides a list of 5000 “best reading selections” that were “approved by distinguished specialists in various lines and organized by librarians into two separate classification schemes”.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne A. Wiegand:245-249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Adoption in Libraries==
After the Catalog had been developed, more and more libraries began to adopt it as the guide for book selection. For instance, Mrs. Horace M. Towner, one of the trustee members of Iowa Library Commission in Corning, published a short paper “Trustees’ Problems” in Iowa Library Quarterly in 1908 discussing the budget problem related to book purchasing.  Towner states that the general rules for books purchasing is depending on the specific situation within each library. In other words, there is no fixed rule for book purchasing. However, Towner discussed a lot about the “right” evaluation of fiction. In order to avoid unsuitable and vicious fiction in a library, trustees should rely on “best” book reviews, in addition to “Booklist” from ALA. In the end of the article, Towner pointed out trustee members should read report from professional journals, like Library Journal and Public Libraries, to obtain knowledge from other library about the budget issue.&lt;ref&gt;Horace. M. Towner. “Trustees’ Problems,” Iowa Library Quarterly 5, no.13 (1908): 189-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aernout''' or '''Aart Jansz Druyvesteyn''' (1577 &amp;ndash; 5 August 1627) was a [[Dutch Golden Age]] lawyer, painter, and mayor of [[Haarlem]].

==Biography==
[[File:Frans Hals 013.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Banquet of the officers of the St. Jorisdoelen'', painted in 1627.]]
According to Van Mander in 1604, he was a promising young landscape painter who came from a good family in Haarlem, and thus painted as a hobby, rather than professionally.&lt;ref name=Mander&gt;{{Link language|nl}}&lt;!--Middle Dutch--&gt; [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0275.htm Aert Jansz Druyvesteyn] in [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''Schilderboeck'', 1604, courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1606 he married Anna de Wael, the daughter of the  Haarlem mayor Johan de Wael, and they had two sons, [[Jacob Druyvesteyn|Jacob]] who followed in his father's footsteps, and Johannes, who died childless in Venice in 1681.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/aa__001biog05_01/aa__001biog05_01_0796.php Aart Jansz Druyvesteyn] in A.J. van der Aa&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Houbraken, who echoes Van Mander's comment that he became a good landscape painter, he became an elder in the Dutch Reformed church before eventually becoming mayor of Haarlem. Houbraken reports that he died on August 5, 1617, aged 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{Link language|nl}}&lt;!--Middle Dutch--&gt; [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0029.htm Aart Jansz Druyvesteyn biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This date makes it very confusing for art historians, because catalogs from the [[Frans Hals museum]] have claimed for decades that this is the same person sitting at the head of the table in [[Frans Hals]]' civic guard (''[[schutterij]]'') group portrait ''[[The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1627]]'' which was painted ten years later.

According to the RKD he painted Italianate landscapes and died on August 5, 1627.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/24376 Aart Jansz Druyvesteyn] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; This would place the occasion of painting the group portrait as the changing of the guards after the death of its most distinguished member.

Linnaeus remarked in edition 6 (as translated) as at [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6871/full/415479a.html this link]: "''I have come to these conclusions by personally leading my pupils on wanderings through the tangled web of nature, in order that I can spur others on to an examination and explanation of nature rather than the reiteration of perceived ideas ... I shall take exception to the tales of actors and the barkings of dogs with equal measure.''".&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Paradoxa'' ==
These 10 taxa appear in the 1st to 5th editions:
* [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]: Linnaeus wrote: "Hydra: body of a snake, with two feet, seven necks and the same number of heads, lacking wings, preserved in [[Hamburg]], similar to the description of the Hydra of the [[Apocalypse]] of St.John chapters 12 and 13. And it is provided by very many as a true species of animal, but falsely. Nature for itself and always the similar, never naturally makes multiple heads on one body. Fraud and artifice, as we ourselves saw [on it] teeth of a weasel, different from teeth of an Amphibian [or reptile], easily detected." See [[Carl Linnaeus#Doctorate]]. (Distinguish from the small real coelenterate [[Hydra (genus)]].)
* [[Pseudis paradoxa|Rana-Piscis]]: a South American frog which is significantly smaller than its [[tadpole]] stage; it was thus (incorrectly) reported to Linnaeus that the metamorphosis in this species went from 'frog to fish'. In the Paradoxa in the 1st edition of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus wrote "Frog-Fish or Frog Changing into Fish: is much against teaching. Frogs, like all Amphibia, delight in lungs and spiny bones. Spiny fish, instead of lungs, are equipped with gills. Therefore the laws of Nature will be against this change. If indeed a fish is equipped with gills, it will be separate from the Frog and Amphibia. If truly [it has] lungs, it will be a Lizard: for under all the sky it differs from [[Chondropterygii]] and [[Plagiuri]].". In the 10th edition of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus named the species ''[[Pseudis paradoxa|Rana paradoxa]]'', though its genus name was changed in 1830 to ''[[Pseudis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =S. W. Garman |year=1877 |title=''Pseudis'', the paradoxical frog |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=587–591 |url=https://archive.org/stream/americannatural04instgoog#page/n591/mode/2up |jstor=2447862 |doi=10.1086/271961}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Monocerus|Monoceros]] (unicorn): Linnaeus wrote: "Monoceros of the older [generations], body of a horse, feet of a "wild animal", horn straight, long, spirally twisted. It is a figment of painters. The [[Monodon]] of [[Peter Artedi|Artedi]] [= narwhal] has the same manner of horn, but the other parts of its body are very different."
* [[Pelican#Symbolism and popular culture|Pelecanus]]: Linnaeus wrote "Pelican: The same [sources as for the previous] hand down fabulously [the story] that it inflicts a wound with its beak on its own thigh, to feed its young with the flowing blood. A sack hanging below its throat gave a handle for the story." This source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Andy|last1=Dobson|first2=Kevin D.|first3=Armand M. |first4=Ryan F. |first5=Walter|lastauthoramp=y |year=2008 |title=Homage to Linnaeus: How many parasites?

* [[Satyrus (ape)|Satyrus]]: Linnaeus wrote "with a tail, hairy, bearded, with a manlike body, gesticulating much, very fallacious, is a species of monkey, if ever one has been seen."&lt;ref name="kth.se"&gt;Carl Linnaeus, Systema naturae (1735; facsimile of the first edition), trans.

* [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Borometz]] (aka [[Scythia]]n Lamb): Linnaeus wrote: "Borometz or [[Scythia]]n Lamb: is reckoned with plants, and is similar to a lamb; whose stalk coming out of the ground enters an [[Navel|umbilicus]]; and the same is said to be provided with blood from by chance devouring wild animals. But it is put together artificially from roots of American ferns. But naturally it is an [[allegorical]] description of an ''[[embryo]] of a sheep'', as has all attributed data.".

* [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]: Linnaeus wrote: "Species of bird, of which only one individual exists in the world, and which when decrepit [arises?] from [its] pyre made of aromatic [plants?] is said fabulously to become again young, to undergo happy former periods of life. In reality it is the [[date palm]], see ''[[Engelbert Kaempfer|Kæmpf]]''".
* Linnaeus wrote: The [[Barnacle goose#Folklore|Bernicla]] or [[Scotland|Scottish]] goose &amp; Goose-bearing Seashell: is believed by former generations to be born from rotten wood thrown away in the sea. But the [[Lepas]] places seaweed on its featherlike internal parts, and somewhat adhering, as if indeed that goose Bernicla was arising from it. [[Frederick Edward Hulme]] noted: "[The] barnacle-goose tree was a great article of faith with our ancestors in the Middle Ages."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Myth-land|author =Hulme, F.E.|date=1886|publisher=S. Low, Marston, Searle &amp; Rivington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrBZAAAAMAAJ|page=168|accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dragon|Draco]]: Linnaeus wrote that it has a "snakelike body, two feet, two wings, like a bat, which is a ''[[Draco (genus)|winged lizard]]'' or a ''[[Raja (genus)|ray]]'' artificially shaped as a monster and dried."&lt;ref name="kth.se"/&gt; See also [[Jenny Haniver]].
* [[Death watch beetle|Automa Mortis]] Linnaeus wrote "Death-watch: It produces the sound of a very small clock in walls, is named ''Pediculus pulsatorius'', which perforates wood and lives in it".

The above 10 taxa and the 4 taxa following were in the 2nd (1740) edition and the 4th and 5th editions (total 14 entries):&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Systema naturae in quo naturae regna tria: secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, systematice proponuntur|author =von Linné, C.|date=1740|publisher=Apud G. Kiesewetter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oXsZAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=manticora#v=snippet&amp;q=manticora&amp;f=false|page=66|accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Manticore|Manticora]]: Linnaeus wrote merely: "face of a decrepit old man, body of a lion, tail starred with sharp points".
* [[Antelope#Etymology|Antilope]] {{sic}}: Linnaeus wrote merely: "Face of a "wild animal", feet [like those] of cattle, horns like a goat's [but] saw-edged".
* [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]]: Linnaeus wrote merely: "Face of a man, breasts of a virgin, body of a four-footed animal [but] scaled, forefeet of a "wild animal", hind[feet] [like those] of cattle".
* [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]: Linnaeus wrote: "''[[Peter Artedi|Art.]] [[Genus|gen.]]'' 81 Syrene ''[[Thomas Bartholin|Bartol]]'': As long as it is not seen either living or dead, nor faithfully and perfectly described, it is called in doubt".
*::Linnaeus's reference is to [[Peter Artedi]]'s writing about the Siren: "Two fins only on all the body, those on the chest. No finned tail. Head and neck and chest to the umbilicus have the human appearance. ... Our or Bartholin's Siren was found and captured in the sea near Massilia in America. From the umbilicus to the extremity of the body was unformed flesh with no sign of a tail. Two pectoral fins on the chest, with five bones or fingers, staying together, by which it swims. Its [[radius (bone)|radius]] in the forearm is scarcely four fingers' width long. Oh that there could arise a true [[ichthyologist]], who could examine this animal, as to whether it is a fable, or a true fish? About something which has not been seen it is preferable not to judge, than boldly to pronounce something.". Among references and quotations from other authors Artedi quoted that "some say that it is a [[manatee]] and others say completely different."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Artedi, 1738, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5XRcAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Philosophia Ichthyologica], p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atlantic salmon''' (''Salmo salar'') is a species of ray-finned fish in the family [[Salmonidae]]. It is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean, in rivers that flow into the north Atlantic and, due to human introduction, in the north Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="Shearer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shearer, W. |title=The Atlantic Salmon |publisher=Halstead Press |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Audubon"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Fishes, Whales &amp; Dolphins |publisher=Chanticleer Press |year=1983 |page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Atlantic salmon have long been the target of recreational and commercial fishing, and this, as well as habitat destruction, has reduced their numbers significantly; the species is the subject of conservation efforts in several countries.

==Nomenclature==
The Atlantic salmon was given its scientific binomial name by [[zoology|zoologist]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] in [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]]. The name, ''Salmo salar'', derives from the [[Latin]] ''salmo'', meaning [[salmon]], and ''salar'', meaning leaper, according to M. Barton,&lt;ref&gt;Barton, M.: "Biology of Fishes.", pages 198–202 Thompson Brooks/Cole 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but more likely meaning "resident of salt water" {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}.  Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1879) translates ''salar'' as a kind of trout from its use in the ''Idylls'' of the poet Ausonius (4th century CE). Later, the differently coloured smolts were found to be the same species.

Other names used to reference Atlantic salmon are: bay salmon, black salmon, caplin-scull salmon, Sebago salmon, silver salmon, fiddler, or outside salmon. At different points in their maturation and life cycle, they are known as parr, smolt, grilse, grilt, kelt, slink, and spring salmon. Atlantic salmon that do not journey to sea are known as landlocked salmon or ouananiche.

==Description==
[[File:Atlantic salmon Atlantic fish.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|Atlantic salmon are among the largest salmon species}}]]

Atlantic salmon are the largest species in their genus, ''Salmo''. After two years at sea, the fish average {{convert|71|to|76|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|3.6|to|5.4|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/fish/atlanticsalmon.htm|title=Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)|publisher=[[NOAA Fisheries]] - Office of Protected Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; But specimens that spend four or more winters feeding at sea can be much larger. An Atlantic salmon netted in 1960 in Scotland, in the estuary of the river Hope, weighed {{convert|49.44|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, the heaviest recorded in all available literature. Another netted in 1925 in Norway measured {{convert|160.65|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the longest Atlantic salmon on record.&lt;ref name="Buller"&gt;"Buller F, '' The Domesday Book of Giant Salmon Volume 1 &amp; 2''. Constable (2007) &amp; Constable (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The colouration of young Atlantic salmon does not resemble the adult stage. While they live in fresh water, they have blue and red spots. At maturity, they take on a silver-blue sheen. The easiest way of identifying them as an adult is by the black spots predominantly above the [[lateral line]], though the [[caudal fin]] is usually unspotted. When they reproduce, males take on a slight green or red colouration. The salmon has a [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] body, and well-developed [[tooth|teeth]]. All fins, save the adipose, are bordered with black.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Ocean migration of Altantic salmon.gif|thumb|300px|right|{{center|Ocean migration of Atlantic salmon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/r5crc/Stuff/appc.html Atlantic Salmon Life Cycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115064920/http://www.fws.gov/r5crc/Stuff/appc.html |date=15 January 2014 }} Connecticut River Coordinator's Office, ''U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service''. Updated: 13 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}]]

The distribution of Atlantic salmon depends on water temperature. Because of [[climate change]], some of the species' southern populations, in Spain and other warm countries, are growing smaller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110826085246.htm|title=Same number of fishermen, but less salmon in Spanish rivers|publisher=science daily|date=August 26, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=J. L. Horreo, G. Machado-Schiaffino, A. M. Griffiths, D. Bright, J. R. Stevens, E. Garcia-Vazquez.  |title=Atlantic Salmon at Risk: Apparent Rapid Declines in Effective Population Size in Southern European Populations.|publisher=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 2011; 140 (3): 605 DOI: 10.1080/00028487.2011.585574|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are expected to be [[Local extinction|extirpated]] soon. Before human influence, the natural breeding grounds of Atlantic salmon were rivers in Europe and the eastern coast of North America. When North America was settled by Europeans, eggs were brought on trains to the west coast and introduced into the rivers there. Other attempts to bring Atlantic salmon to new settlements were made; e.g. New Zealand. But since there are no suitable ocean currents on New Zealand, most of these introductions failed. There is at least one landlocked population of Atlantic salmon on New Zealand, where the fish never go out to sea.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Young salmon spend one to four years in their natal river. When they are large enough (c. {{convert|15|cm|in}}), they [[smoltification|smoltify]], changing camouflage from stream-adapted with large, gray spots to sea-adapted with shiny sides. They also undergo some endocrinological changes to adapt to [[osmosis|osmotic]] differences between fresh water and seawater habitat. When smoltification is complete, the parr (young fish) now begin to swim with the current instead of against it. With this behavioral change, the fish are now referred to as smolt. When the smolt reach the sea, they follow sea surface currents and feed on plankton or fry from other fish species such as herring. During their time at sea, they can sense the change in the Earth magnetic field through iron in their lateral line.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

When they have had a year of good growth, they will move to the sea surface currents that transport them back to their natal river. It is a major misconception that salmon swim thousands of kilometers at sea; instead they surf through sea surface currents. When they reach their natal river they find it by smell; only 5% of Atlantic salmon go up the wrong river. Thus, the habitat of Atlantic salmon is the river where they are born and the sea surface currents that are connected to that river in a circular path.

Wild salmon disappeared from many rivers during the twentieth century due to [[overfishing]] and habitat change.&lt;ref name="Shearer"/&gt; By 2000, the numbers of Atlantic salmon had dropped to critically low levels.&lt;ref name=Dempson&gt;{{cite journal |title=Estimation of marine exploitation rates on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) stocks in Newfoundland, Canada |authors= B. Dempson, C. J. Schwarz, D. G. Reddin, M. F. O'Connell, C. C. Mullins, and C. E.

==Diet==
Young salmon begin a feeding response within a few days. After the yolk sac is absorbed by the body, they begin to hunt. Juveniles start with tiny invertebrates, but as they mature, they may occasionally eat small fish. During this time, they hunt both in the [[substrate (marine biology)|substrate]] and in the current. Some have been known to eat salmon eggs. The most commonly eaten foods include [[caddisfly|caddisflies]], [[black fly|blackflies]], [[mayfly|mayflies]], and [[stonefly|stoneflies]].&lt;ref name="Shearer"/&gt;

As adults, the salmon prefer capelin as their meal of choice. Capelin are elongated silvery baitfish that grow up to 8-10 inches long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/atlantic-salmon-protected|title=Atlantic Salmon - Protected {{!}} NOAA Fisheries|last=Fisheries|first=NOAA|date=2018-08-21|website=www.fisheries.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Behavior==
Fry and parr have been said to be territorial, but evidence showing them to guard territories is inconclusive. While they may occasionally be aggressive towards each other, the [[sociobiology|social hierarchy]] is still unclear. Many have been found to [[Shoaling and schooling|school]], especially when leaving the estuary.

Adult Atlantic salmon are considered much more aggressive than other salmon, and are more likely to attack other fish than others. A matter of concern is where they have become an [[invasive species|invasive]] threat, attacking native salmon, such as [[Chinook salmon]] and [[coho salmon]].&lt;ref name="Shearer"/&gt;

==Life stages==
[[File:Life cycle of the Atlantic salmon.gif|thumb|400px|right|{{center|Life cycle of the Atlantic salmon}}]]
{{see also|Juvenile salmon}}

Most Atlantic salmon follow an [[fish migration|anadromous fish migration]] pattern,&lt;ref name="Audubon"/&gt; in that they undergo their greatest feeding and growth in saltwater; however, adults return to [[spawn (biology)|spawn]] in native [[freshwater]] streams where the eggs hatch and juveniles grow through several distinct stages.

Atlantic salmon do not require saltwater. Numerous examples of fully freshwater (i.e., "landlocked") populations of the species exist throughout the [[Northern Hemisphere]],&lt;ref name="Audubon"/&gt; including a now extinct population in [[Lake Ontario]], which have been shown in recent studies to have spent their entire life cycle in watershed of the lake.&lt;ref name=lake&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/11/08/study-sheds-light-on-extinct-lake-ontario-salmon.html "Study sheds light on extinct Lake Ontario salmon"]. ''Toronto Star'', November 9, 2016, page GT1.&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the landlocked strains are frequently known as ''ouananiche''.

===Freshwater phase===
The freshwater phases of Atlantic salmon vary between two and eight years, according to river location.&lt;ref name=Klemetsen&gt;{{cite journal |title=Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L. and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.): a review of aspects of their life histories |authors=Klemetsen A, Amundsen P-A, Dempson JB, Jonsson B, Jonsson N, O'Connell MF, Mortensen E |journal=Ecology of Freshwater Fish |year=2003 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0633.2003.00010.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the young in southern rivers, such as those to the [[English Channel]], are only one year old when they leave, those further north, such as in [[Scotland|Scottish]] rivers, can be over four years old, and in [[Ungava Bay]], northern Quebec, smolts as old as eight years have been encountered.&lt;ref name=Klemetsen/&gt; The average age correlates to temperature exceeding 7&amp;nbsp;°C (45&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="Shearer"/&gt;

The first phase is the [[alevin]] stage, when the fish stay in the breeding ground and use the remaining nutrients in their [[yolk sac]]s. During this developmental stage, their young gills develop and they become active hunters. Next is the [[spawn (biology)|fry]] stage, where the fish grow and subsequently leave the breeding ground in search of food. During this time, they move to areas with higher prey concentration. The final freshwater stage is when they develop into [[parr (fish)|parr]], in which they prepare for the trek to the Atlantic Ocean.

During these times, the Atlantic salmon are very susceptible to [[predation]]. Nearly 40% are eaten by [[trout]] alone. Other predators include other fish and birds.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}. Egg and juvenile survival is highly dependent on habitat quality as Atlantic salmon are sensitive to ecological change.

===Saltwater phases===
When parr develop into [[Juvenile fish|smolt]], they begin the trip to the ocean, which predominantly happens between March and June. Migration allows [[acclimate|acclimation]] to the changing [[salinity]]. Once ready, young smolt leave, preferring an [[wikt:Ebb tide|ebb tide]].

Having left their [[Natal homing|natal streams]], they experience a period of rapid growth during the one to four years they live in the ocean. Typically, Atlantic salmon migrate from their home streams to an area on the continental plate off West [[Greenland]]. During this time, they face predation from humans, [[Pinniped|seals]], [[Greenland shark]]s, [[Skate (fish)|skate]], [[cod]], and [[halibut]]. Some [[dolphin]]s have been noticed playing with dead salmon, but it is still unclear whether they consume them.

Once large enough, Atlantic salmon change into the [[grilse]] phase, when they become ready to return to the same freshwater tributary they departed from as smolts. After returning to their natal streams, the salmon will cease eating altogether prior to spawning. Although largely unknown, odor – the exact chemical signature of that stream – may play an important role in how salmon return to the area where they hatched. Once heavier than about 250&amp;nbsp;g, the fish no longer become prey for birds and many fish, although seals do prey upon them. [[Grey seal|Grey]] and [[Common seal|common]] seals commonly eat Atlantic salmon. Survivability to this stage has been estimated at between 14 and 53%.&lt;ref name="Shearer"/&gt;

==Breeding==
[[File:The cauld by the Philiphaugh Salmon Viewing Centre - geograph.org.uk - 618657.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fish ladder]] for Atlantic salmon constructed in the middle of a large [[weir]]]]
{{see also|Salmon run}}

Atlantic salmon breed in the rivers of Western Europe from northern [[Portugal]] north to [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], and [[Greenland]], and the east coast of North America from [[Connecticut]] in the United States north to northern [[Labrador]] and Arctic Canada.

The species constructs a nest or "redd" in the gravel bed of a stream. The female creates a powerful downdraught of water with her tail near the gravel to excavate a depression. After she and a male fish have eggs and [[milt]] (sperm), respectively, upstream of the depression, the female again uses her tail, this time to shift gravel to cover the eggs and milt which have lodged in the depression.

Unlike the various Pacific salmon species which die after spawning ([[semelparous]]), the Atlantic salmon is [[iteroparous]], which means the fish may recondition themselves and return to the sea to repeat the migration and spawning pattern several times, although most spawn only once or twice.&lt;ref name="Audubon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heen"&gt;{{cite book |author=Heen, K. |title=Salmon Aquaculture |publisher=Halstead Press |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration and spawning exact an enormous physiological toll on individuals, such that repeat spawners are the exception rather than the norm.&lt;ref name="Heen"/&gt; Atlantic salmon show high diversity in age of maturity and may mature as parr, one- to five-sea-winter fish, and in rare instances, at older sea ages. This variety of ages can occur in the same population, constituting a '[[Bet-hedging (biology)|bet hedging]]' strategy against variation in stream flows. So in a drought year, some fish of a given age will not return to spawn, allowing that generation other, wetter years in which to spawn.&lt;ref name=Klemetsen/&gt;

==Hybridization==
When in shared breeding habitats, Atlantic salmon will hybridize with [[brown trout]] (''Salmo trutta'').&lt;ref&gt;Youngson, A. F., Webb, J. H., Thompson, C. E., and Knox, D. 1993. Spawning of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon

Hybrids between Atlantic salmon and brown trout were detected in two of four watersheds studied in northern [[Spain]]. The proportions of hybrids in samples of 'salmon' ranged from 0 to 7-7% but they were not significantly heterogeneous among locations, resulting in a mean hybridization rate of 2-3%. This is the highest rate of natural hybridization so far reported and is significantly greater than rates observed elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/352621/Natural_hybridization_between_Atlantic_salmon_Salmo_salar_and_brown_trout_Salmo_trutta_in_northern_Spain Natural hybridization between Atlantic salmon (''Salmo salar'') and brown trout (''Salmo trutta'') in northern Spain by Carlos Garcia de Leaniz]&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study discovered extensive hybridization of domesticated Atlantic salmon in the Northwest Atlantic by showing that 27.1% of fish in 17 out of 18 rivers examined are hybrids or feral.&lt;ref name="Wringe2018" /&gt;

==Aquaculture==
[[File:Færøsk havbrug.1.jpg|thumb|right|Atlantic salmon marine cages in the [[Faroe Islands]]]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Salmon farming.jpg|thumb|A salmon farm holds yearlings for up to two years; many hold [[broodstock]] for even longer in these conditions to help ensure large, [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] adults. As is the case with this [[British Columbia]] farm, a majority of salmon farms are located in waters where Atlantic salmon is not native and risk becoming an [[invasive species]] upon release or escape.]] --&gt;
{{See also|Salmon in aquaculture}}

In its natal streams, Atlantic salmon are considered prized recreational fish, pursued by [[fly fishing|fly anglers]] during its annual runs. At one time, the species supported an important commercial fishery and a supplemental food fishery. However, the wild Atlantic salmon fishery is commercially dead; after extensive habitat damage and overfishing, wild fish make up only 0.5% of the Atlantic salmon available in world fish markets. The rest are farmed, predominantly from [[aquaculture]] in Norway, Chile, Canada, the UK, Ireland, [[Faroe Islands]], Russia and [[Tasmania]] in Australia. [[Sport fishing]] communities, mainly from Iceland and [[Scandinavia]], have joined in the North Atlantic Salmon Fund to buy away commercial quotas in an effort to save the wild species of ''Salmo salar''.&lt;ref name="Heen"/&gt;

===Process===
Adult male and female fish are [[anesthesia|anaesthetised]]; their eggs and sperm are "stripped" after the fish are cleaned and cloth dried. Sperm and eggs are mixed, washed, and placed into freshwater. Adults recover in flowing, clean, well-[[aeration|aerated]] water.&lt;ref name="Sedgwick"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sedgwick, S. |title=Salmon Farming Handbook |publisher=Fishing News Books LTD |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have even studied [[cryopreservation]] of their eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=N. Bromage |title=Broodstock Management and Egg and Larval Quality |publisher=[[Blackwell Science]] |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry are generally reared in large freshwater tanks for 12 to 20 months. Once the fish have reached the smolt phase, they are taken out to sea, where they are held for up to two years. During this time, the fish grow and mature in large cages off the coasts of Canada, the USA, or parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="Heen"/&gt;

Generally, cages are made of two nets. Inner nets, which wrap around the cages, hold the salmon. Outer nets, which are held by floats, keep predators out.&lt;ref name="Sedgwick"/&gt;

===Controversy===
Farmed Atlantic salmon are known to occasionally escape from cages and enter the habitat of wild populations. Interbreeding between escaped farm fish and wild fish decreases genetic diversity and introduces "the
potential to genetically alter native populations, reduce local adaptation and
negatively affect population viability and character."&lt;ref name="thorstad2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorstad|first1=Eva B.|last2=Fleming|first2=Ian A.|last3=McGinnity|first3=Philip|last4=Soto|first4=Doris|last5=Wennevik|first5=Vidar|last6=Whoriskey|first6=Fred|title=Incidence and impacts of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in nature|date=2008|publisher=World Wildlife Fund, Inc.|isbn=978-82-426-1966-2|page=6|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-aj272e.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the west coast of the United States and Canada, aquaculturists are generally under scrutiny to ensure that non-native Atlantic salmon cannot escape from their open-net pens, however occasional incidents of escape have been documented.&lt;ref name="barry2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barry|first1=Tricia K.|last2=VanderZwaag|first2=David L.|title=Preventing Salmon Escapes from Aquaculture in Canada and the USA: Limited International Coordinates, Divergent Regulatory Currents and Possible Future Courses|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|location=Oxford, UK|page=58|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2101241_code715395.pdf?abstractid=2101241&amp;mirid=1&amp;type=2|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During one incident in 2017, for example, up to 300,000 potentially invasive Atlantic salmon escaped a farm among the San Juan Islands in Puget Sound, Washington.&lt;ref name="bellingham2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donaldson|first1=Jim|title=Fish farm fiasco: Why officials want you to catch as many salmon as you can|url=http://www.bellinghamherald.com/news/local/article168610432.html|accessdate=23 August 2017|publisher=Bellingham Herald|date=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being the source of considerable controversy,&lt;ref name="mapes2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mapes|first1=Linda V.|last2=Bernton|first2=Hal|title=Please go fishing, Washington state says after farmed Atlantic salmon escape broken net|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/oops-after-accidental-release-of-atlantic-salmon-fisherman-being-told-catch-as-many-as-you-want/|accessdate=27 December 2017|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the likelihood of escaped Atlantic salmon establishing an invasive presence in the Pacific Northwest is considered minimal, largely because a number of 20th century efforts aimed at deliberately introducing them to the region were ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="amos1999"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amos|first1=Kevin H.|last2=Appleby|first2=Andrew|title=Atlantic Salmon in Washington State: A Fish Management Perspective|url=https://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00922/wdfw00922.pdf|website=Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife|publisher=State of Washington|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1905 until 1935, for example, in excess of 8.6 million Atlantic salmon of various life stages (predominantly advanced fry) were intentionally introduced to more than 60 individual [[British Columbia]] lakes and streams. Historical records indicate, in a few instances, mature sea-run Atlantic salmon were captured in the [[Cowichan River]]; however, a self-sustaining population never materialized. Similarly unsuccessful results were realized after deliberate attempts at introduction by Washington as late as the 1980s.&lt;ref name="pechlaner2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pechlaner|first1=Gabriela|last2=Rutherford|first2=Murray B.|title=Common Future, Different Policy Paths?

Farming of Atlantic Salmon at sea in open cages has been linked to the decline in wild stocks. On exposure to farmed salmon, abundance of all wild migratory salmonid (e.g. Atlantic Salmon, sea trout, pink, chum, and coho Salmon) has been observed to decline; in some case by as much as 50% per generation. It has been shown that this decline can be attributed to both the interbreeding of farmed and wild salmon and the passing of parasites from farmed to wild salmon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Jennifer S.|last2=Myers|first2=Ransom A.|title=A Global Assessment of Salmon Aquaculture Impacts on Wild Salmonids|journal=PLOS Biology|date=12 February 2008|volume=6|issue=2|pages=e33|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060033|url=https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060033|language=en|issn=1545-7885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human impact==
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Salmon fishing (State 1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Seine fishing]] for salmon – [[Wenzel Hollar]], 1607–1677]]

Atlantic salmon were once abundant throughout the North Atlantic. European fishermen [[Gillnetting|gillnetted]] for Atlantic salmon in rivers using hand-made nets for at least several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, J. Geraint (1974). ''Nets and Coracles'', p. 68. London, David and Charles.&lt;/ref&gt; Wood and stone weirs along streams and ponds were used for millennia to harvest salmon in the rivers of Maine and New England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The River|url=http://www.penobscotriver.org/content/4004/the-river|work=The Penobscot River Restoration Trust|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gillnetting was an early fishing technology in colonial America.&lt;ref&gt;Netboy, Anthony (1973) ''The Salmon: Their Fight for Survival,'' pp. 181-182. Boston, Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human activities have heavily damaged salmon populations across their range. The major impacts were from overfishing and habitat change, and the new threat from competitive farmed fish. Salmon decline in [[Lake Ontario]] goes back to the 18th–19th centuries, due to logging and soil erosion, as well as dam and mill construction. By 1896, the species was declared extirpated from the lake.&lt;ref name="Harb"&gt;Harb, M.  "Upstream Battle", ''Canadian Geographic Magazine'', June 2008, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lake /&gt;  When dams were constructed on the [[Oswego River (New York)|Oswego River]], their spawning areas were cut off and they went [[extinct]] locally.

In the 1950s, salmon from rivers in the United States and Canada, as well as from Europe, were discovered to gather in the sea around [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. A commercial fishing industry was established, taking salmon using [[drift net]]s. After an initial series of record annual catches, the numbers crashed; between 1979 and 1990, catches fell from four million to 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Salmon campaigner lands top award |date=22 April 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6571241.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overfishing at sea is generally considered the primary factor.

[[File:Pabos Ouest.jpg|thumb|An Atlantic Salmon Recreational Fishermen in the [[Grand Pabos River|Pabos River]] of [[Quebec]].]]

Beginning around 1990, the rates of Atlantic salmon mortality at sea more than doubled. In the western Atlantic, fewer than 100,000 of the important multiple sea-winter salmon were returning. Rivers of the coast of [[Maine]], southern [[New Brunswick]] and much of mainland [[Nova Scotia]] saw runs drop precipitously, and even disappear. To find out more about the increased mortality rate, a concerted international effort has been organized by the [[North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlantic Salmon|url=http://animallist.weebly.com/atlantic-salmon.html|work=animallist.weebly.com|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly because of improvements in ocean feeding grounds, returns in 2008 were positive. On the [[Penobscot River]] in Maine, returns were about 940 in 2007, and by mid-July 2008, the return was 1,938. Similar stories were reported in rivers from Newfoundland to [[Quebec]]. In 2011, more than 3,100 salmon returned to the Penobscot, the most since 1986, and nearly 200 ascended the [[Narraguagus River]], up from the low two digits just a decade before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shiny Patches in Maine's Streambeds Are Bright Sign for Salmon |first=Murray |last=Carpenter

Recreational fishing of atlantic salmon is now authorized in almost every country with a large atlantic salmon population, but it is subject to many States/[[Provinces and territories of Canada|Provinces]]  regulations that are designed not to disturb the continuity of the species. Strict catch limits, [[catch and release]] practices and forced [[fly fishing]] are examples of those regulations.

==Recovery==
[[File:Fishmonger in ICA Fish stall holding a salmon.jpg|thumb|A fishmonger in [[Lysekil]], Sweden shows a Norwegian salmon.]]
Around the North Atlantic, efforts to restore salmon to their native habitats are underway, with slow progress. Habitat restoration and protection are key to this process, but issues of excessive harvest and competition with farmed and escaped salmon are also primary considerations. In the [[Great Lakes]], Atlantic salmon have been introduced successfully, but the percentage of salmon reproducing naturally is very low. Most are stocked annually. Atlantic salmon were native to Lake Ontario, but were extirpated by habitat loss and overfishing in the late 19th century. The state of New York has since stocked its adjoining rivers and tributaries, and in many cases does not allow active fishing.&lt;ref name="Audubon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mills, D. |title=Ecology and Management of Atlantic Salmon |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the [[Housatonic River]], and its [[Naugatuck River]] tributary, hosted the southernmost Atlantic salmon spawning runs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Status Review for Anadromous Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) in the United States.

In the early 1990s, Carlson challenged the notion that Atlantic salmon were prehistorically abundant in New England, when the climate was warmer as it is now. This idea was based on a paucity of bone data in archaeological sites relative to other fish species and claimed that historical observer records were exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Where's the salmon?

In [[New England]], many efforts are underway to restore salmon to the region by knocking down obsolete dams and updating others with [[fish ladder]]s and other techniques that have proven effective in the West with [[Pacific salmon]]. There is some success thus far, with populations growing in the Penobscot and [[Connecticut River]]s. [[Lake Champlain]] now has Atlantic salmon. In [[Ontario]], the Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bringbackthesalmon.ca/|title=Lake Ontario Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was started in 2006, and is one of the largest freshwater conservation programs in North America. It has stocked Lake Ontario with over 700,000 young Atlantic salmon.  Recent documented successes in the reintroduction of Atlantic salmon include the following:

* A migrating salmon was observed in Ontario's [[Credit River]] in November 2007.&lt;ref name="Harb"/&gt;

Atlantic salmon still remains a popular fish for human consumption.&lt;ref name="Audubon"/&gt; It is commonly sold fresh, canned, or frozen.

==Beaver impact==
The decline in anadromous salmonid species over the last two to three centuries is correlated with the decline in the [[North American beaver]] and [[European beaver]], although some fish and game departments continue to advocate removal of beaver dams as potential barriers to spawning runs. Migration of adult Atlantic salmon may be limited by beaver dams during periods of low stream flows, but the presence of juvenile ''Salmo salar'' upstream from the dams suggests the dams are penetrated by [[Parr (fish)|parr]].&lt;ref name=Collen&gt;{{cite journal |author=P. Collen &amp; R. J. Gibson |year=2001 |title=The general ecology of beavers (''Castor'' spp.), as related to their influence on stream ecosystems and riparian habitats, and the subsequent effects on fish – a review  |journal=[[Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries]] |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=439–461 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/v48769740n817601/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1023/A:1012262217012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows.&lt;ref name=Collen /&gt;

In a 2003 study, Atlantic salmon and sea-run [[brown trout]]/[[sea trout]] spawning in the [[Numedalslågen|Numedalslågen River]] and 51 of its tributaries in southeastern [[Norway]] was unhindered by beavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Howard Park &amp; Øystein Cock Rønning |year=2007 |title=Low potential for restraint of anadromous salmonid reproduction by beaver ''Castor fiber'' in the Numedalslågen river catchment, Norway |journal=[[River Research and Applications]] |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=752–762 |doi=10.1002/rra.1008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a restored, third-order stream in northern Nova Scotia, beaver dams generally posed no barrier to Atlantic salmon migration except in the smallest upstream reaches in years of low flow where pools were not deep enough to enable the fish to leap the dam or without a column of water over-topping the dam for the fish to swim up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Influence of Rainfall and Beaver Dams on Upstream Movement of Spawning Atlantic Salmon in a Restored Brook in Nova Scotia, Canada |authors=Barry A. Taylor, Charles MacInnis, Trevor A. Floyd |journal=River Research and Applications |year=2010 |pages=183–193 |doi=10.1002/rra.1252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of winter habitat to salmonids afforded by beaver ponds may be especially important in streams of northerly latitudes without deep pools where ice cover makes contact with the bottom of shallow streams.&lt;ref name=Collen /&gt; In addition, the up to eight-year-long residence time of juveniles in freshwater may make beaver-created permanent summer pools a crucial success factor for Atlantic salmon populations. In fact, two-year-old Atlantic salmon parr in beaver ponds in eastern Canada showed faster summer growth in length and mass and were in better condition than parr upstream or downstream from the pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Douglas B. Sigourney, Benjamin H. Letcher &amp; Richard A. Cunjak |year=2006 |title=Influence of beaver activity on summer growth and condition of age-2 Atlantic salmon parr |journal=[[Transactions of the American Fisheries Society]] |volume=135 |issue=4 |pages=1068–1075 |doi=10.1577/T05-159.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
The first laws regarding the Atlantic salmon were started nearly 800 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===England and Wales===
[[Edward I of England|Edward I]] instituted a penalty for collecting salmon during certain times of the year. His son [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] continued, regulating the construction of [[weir]]s. Enforcement was overseen by those appointed by the [[justices of the peace]]. Because of confusing laws and the appointed conservators having little power, most laws were barely enforced.

Based on this, a royal commission was appointed in 1860 to thoroughly investigate the Atlantic salmon and the laws governing the species, resulting in the 1861 Salmon Fisheries Act. The act placed enforcement of the laws under the [[Home Office]]'s control, but it was later transferred to the [[Board of Trade]], and then later to the [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food|Board of Agriculture and Fisheries]].

Another act passed in 1865 imposed charges to fish and catch limits. It also caused the formation of local boards having jurisdiction over a certain river. The next significant act, passed in 1907, allowed the board to charge 'duties' to catch other freshwater fish, including trout.

Despite legislation, board effects decreased until, in 1948, the River Boards Act gave authority of all freshwater fish and  the prevention of pollution to one board per river. In total, it created 32 boards.

In 1974, the 32 boards were reduced to 10 regional water authorities (RWAs). Although only the [[Northumbria]]n, [[Welsh people|Welsh]], northwest and southwest RWA's had considerable salmon populations, all ten also cared for trout and [[freshwater eel]]s.

The Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act was passed in 1975. Among other things, it regulated fishing licences, seasons, and size limits, and banned obstructing the salmon's migratory paths.&lt;ref name="Shearer"/&gt;

===Scotland===
Salmon was greatly valued in [[medieval Scotland]], and various fishing methods, including the use of [[weir]]s, cruives, and nets, were used to catch the fish. Fishing for salmon was heavily regulated in order to conserve the resource.&lt;ref name="Buchanan"&gt;Kate Buchanan, "Wheeles and Creels: The Physical Representation of the Right to Milling and Fishing in Sixteenth-Century Angus, Scotland" in ''Medieval and Early Modern Representations of Authority in Scotland and the British Isles'' (eds. Kate Buchanan &amp; Lucinda H.S. Dean with Michael Penman: Routledge, 2016), pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1318, [[Robert I of Scotland|King Robert I]] enacted legislation setting a minimum size for cruives, "so that no [[Juvenile fish|fry of fish]] are impeded from ascending and descending..." Laws on catching fish upon royal lands were frequently updated, demonstrating their importance.&lt;ref name="Buchanan"/&gt; Because the fish were held in such high regard, [[poaching|poachers]] were severely punished; a person twice convicted of poaching salmon on a royal estate could be [[Capital punishment in Scotland|sentenced to death]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Mac Laughlin,''Troubled Waters: A Social and Cultural History of Ireland's Sea Fisheries'' (Four Courts Press, 2010), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The export of salmon was economically important in [[Aberdeen]]; beginning in the 15th century, the fish could be [[Food preservation|preserved]] through salting and barreling, allowing it to be exported abroad, including as far away as [[the Baltic]]. The volume of the early Scottish salmon trade is impossible to determine, since surviving custom records date only from the 1420 onward, and since Aberdeen [[Burgess (title)|burgess]]es enjoyed an exemption on salmon customs until the 1530s.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Stevenson, ''Power and Propaganda: Scotland, 1306-1488'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 15th century, many laws were passed; many regulated fishing times, and worked to ensure smolts could safely pass downstream. [[James III of Scotland|James III]] even closed a [[flour|meal]] [[watermill|mill]] because of its history of killing fish attracted to the wheel.

More recent legislation has established commissioners who manage districts. Furthermore, the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act in 1951 required the [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Secretary of State]] be given data about the catches of salmon and trout to help establish catch limits.&lt;ref name="Shearer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedgwick"/&gt;

===United States===
Several populations of Atlantic salmon are in serious decline, and are listed as endangered under the [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA). Currently, runs of 11 rivers in Maine are on the list – Kennebec, Androscoggin, Penobscot, Sheepscot, Ducktrap, Cove Brook, Pleasant, Narraguagus, Machias, East Machias and Dennys. The [[Penobscot River]] is the "anchor river" for Atlantic salmon populations in the US. Returns in 2008 have been around 2,000, more than double the 2007 return of 940.

Section 9 of the ESA makes it illegal to take an endangered species of fish or wildlife. The definition of "take" is to "harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct".&lt;ref&gt;(16 U.S.C. 1532(19)) http://www.epa.gov/EPA-SPECIES/1998/May/Day-01/e11668.htm{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The [[Government of Canada|federal government]] has prime responsibility for protecting the Atlantic salmon, but over the last generation, effort has continued to shift management as much as possible to [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial authorities]] through memoranda of understanding, for example. A new Atlantic salmon policy is in the works, and in the past three years,{{When|date=February 2011}} the government has attempted to pass a new version of the century-old Fisheries Act through Parliament.

Federal legislation regarding at-risk populations is weak.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Inner [[Bay of Fundy]] Atlantic salmon runs were declared endangered in 2000. As of 2008, no recovery plan is in place.

It takes constant pressure from [[nongovernmental organizations]], such as the Atlantic Salmon Federation, for improvements in management, and for initiatives to be considered. For example, the technology for mitigation of [[acid rain]]-affected rivers used in Norway is needed in 54 [[Nova Scotia]] rivers. Yet, an initiative of the ASF and the Nova Scotia Salmon Association raised the funds to get a project in place, in West River-Sheet Harbour.

In Quebec, the daily catch limit for Atlantic salmon is one fish over {{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on}}, two fish under {{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} or one fish over and one under {{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on}}, provided the smaller fish was the first one caught (a provision designed to prevent an angler from continuing to fish if a large fish is already in possession). The annual catch limit is seven Atlantic salmon of any size.

In Lake Ontario, the historic populations of Atlantic salmon became extinct, and cross-national efforts have been under way to reintroduce the species, with some areas already having restocked naturally reproducing populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|url=http://www.bringbackthesalmon.ca/?page_id=101|website=Bring Back the Salmon Lake Ontario|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Endangered Populations|url=http://www.asf.ca/endangered-populations.html|website=Atlantic Salmon Federation|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASCO==
The [[North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization]] is an international council made up of Canada, the [[European Union]], Iceland, Norway, the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], and the United States, with its headquarters in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasco.int/ |title=NASCO ~ The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization |publisher=Nasco.int |accessdate=11 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121144822/http://www.nasco.int/ |archivedate=21 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1983 to help protect Atlantic salmon stocks, through the cooperation between nations. They work to restore habitat and promote conservation of the salmon.

==Sustainable consumption==
In 2010, [[Greenpeace International]] has added the Atlantic salmon to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410000000/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=10 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Readers may offer comments on the preprint. It was inspired by and intends to complement the [[arXiv]] repository, which mostly focuses on [[physics]] and connected disciplines, launched in 1991 by [[Paul Ginsparg]] (who also serves on the bioRxiv advisory board). It received support from both the CSHL and the [[Lourie Foundation]].&lt;ref name=ASAPbio&gt;{{cite web |last1=Inglis |first1=John R. |last2=Sever |first2=Richard |date=12 February 2016 |title=bioRxiv: a progress report |url=http://asapbio.org/biorxiv |work=[[ASAPbio]]|accessdate=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional funding from the [[Chan Zuckerberg Initiative]] was confirmed in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callaway |first=Ewen |title=BioRxiv preprint server gets cash boost from Chan Zuckerberg Initiative |url=https://www.nature.com/news/biorxiv-preprint-server-gets-cash-boost-from-chan-zuckerberg-initiative-1.21894 |journal=Nature |language=en |doi=10.1038/nature.2017.21894|bibcode=2017Natur.545...18C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaiser |first1=Jocelyn |title=BioRxiv preprint server gets funding from Chan Zuckerberg Initiative |journal=Science |date=26 April 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.aal1117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the establishment of bioRxiv, biological scientists were divided on the issue of having a dedicated preprint repository.&lt;ref name=Nature1/&gt; Many had concerns of having their research [[scoop (news)|scooped]] by competitors and losing their claim to [[discovery (observation)|discovery]]. However, several geneticists had submitted papers to the "[[quantitative biology]]" section of the arXiv repository (launched in 2003) and no longer had those concerns, as they could point to preprints to support their claims of discovery.&lt;ref name=Nature1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Callaway |first1=Ewen |title=Geneticists eye the potential of arXiv |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=31 July 2012 |volume=488 |issue=7409 |page=19 |doi=10.1038/488019a |doi-access=free |pmid=22859182|bibcode=2012Natur.488...19C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of bioRxiv's popularity, several biology journals have updated their policies on preprints,&lt;ref name=ASAPbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Science/&gt; clarifying they do not consider preprints to be a 'prior publication' for purpose of the [[Ingelfinger rule]].  Over 20,000 [[twitter|tweets]] were made about bioRxiv-hosted preprints in 2015.&lt;ref name=ASAPbio/&gt; In July 2017, the number of monthly submissions exceeded 1,000.&lt;ref name=JohnInglisTweet&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/JohnRInglis/status/880996280616484864|title=A life sci #preprint milestone: @biorxivpreprint’s first &gt;1000 ms month.

==Submission rate==

Jocelyn Kaiser of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' said that in their first year, the repository had "attracted a modest but growing stream of papers", having hosted 824 preprints.&lt;ref name=Science&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaiser |first=Jocelyn |date=11 November 2014 |title=BioRxiv at 1 year: A promising start |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/11/biorxiv-1-year-promising-start |work=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of February 2016, the submission rate to bioRxiv had steadily increased from ~60 to ~200 per month.&lt;ref name=ASAPbio/&gt;  In 2017, the number of monthly submissions rose from over 800 in March &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/JohnRInglis/status/836809771722366978|title=John Inglis on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to more than  1000 in July&lt;ref name=JohnInglisTweet/&gt; with a total number of 10,722 papers submitted in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/search/limit_from:2017-01-01%20limit_to:2017-12-31%20numresults:10%20sort:relevance-rank%20format_result:standard|title=Search Results {{!}} bioRxiv|last=|first=|date=|website=biorxiv.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''curriculum vitae''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|k|j|ʊ|l|ə|m|_|ˈ|v|iː|t|aɪ|,_|-|ˈ|w|iː|t|aɪ|,_|-|ˈ|v|aɪ|t|iː}})&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/curriculum+vitae |title=Curriculum Vitae &amp;#124; Definition of Curriculum Vitae by Merriam-Webster|publisher=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ahdictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=curriculum%20vitae |title=American Heritage Dictionary Entry: curriculum vitae|publisher=ahdictionary.com|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (often shortened '''CV''', '''résumé''' or '''vita''') is a written overview of a person's experience and other qualifications for a job opportunity. It is akin to a [[résumé]] in North America. In some countries, a CV is typically the first item that a potential [[employer]] encounters regarding the job seeker and is typically used to screen applicants, often followed by an [[job interview|interview]]. CVs may also be requested for applicants to postsecondary programs, scholarships, grants and bursaries. In the 2010s, some applicants provide an electronic text of their CV to employers using [[email]], an online [[employment website]] or using a job-oriented [[social networking service|social-networking-service]] [[website]], such as [[LinkedIn]].

== Contents ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
&lt;!-- Deleted for image removed: [[Image:Simple British CV.jpg|thumb|The first part of a Isi CV used in the United States] --&gt;
In the [[United Kingdom]], most [[Commonwealth countries]], and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], a CV is short (usually a maximum of two sides of [[ISO 216|A4]] paper), and therefore contains only a summary of the job seeker's employment history, qualifications, education, and some personal information. Some parts of Asia require applicants' photos, date of birth, and most recent salary information. CVs are often tailored to change the emphasis of the information according to the particular position for which the job seeker is applying. A CV can also be extended to include an extra page for the jobseeker's publications if these are important for the job.

In the [[United States]], [[Pakistan]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[India]], and [[Cuba]] a CV is a comprehensive document used in academic circles and medical careers that elaborate on education, publications, and other achievements. A CV contains greater detail than a [[résumé]], a shorter summary which is more often used in applications for jobs, but it is often expected that professionals use a short CV that highlights the current focus of their academic lives and not necessarily their full history. A CV is generally used when applying for a position in academia, while a resume is generally used when applying for a position in industry, non-profit, and the public sector.&lt;ref name="ucdavis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icc.ucdavis.edu/materials/resume/resumecv.htm|title=Resume vs. Curriculum Vitae: What's the Difference? &amp;#124; Internship and Career Center|publisher=icc.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology, spellings and pronunciation ==
''Curriculum vitae'' is a [[Latin]] expression which can be loosely translated as ''[the] course of [my] life''. In current usage, ''curriculum'' is less [[markedness|marked]] as a foreign [[loanword]]. Traditionally the word ''vitae'' is rendered in English using the [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]] [[æ]], hence ''vitæ'',&lt;ref&gt;[[List of words that may be spelled with a ligature]]&lt;/ref&gt; although this convention (curriculum vitæ) is less common in contemporary practice.

The plural of ''curriculum vitae'', in Latin, is formed following Latin rules of grammar as ''curricula vitae'', and is used along with ''curricula vitarum'',&lt;ref name=aueFAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxplural.html |title=alt.usage.english FAQ |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403101518/http://www.alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxplural.html |archivedate=3 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; each of which is debated as being more grammatically correct than the other.

In English, the plural of the full expression curriculum vitae is seldom used; the plural of ''curriculum'' on its own is usually written as "curricula",&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, Houghton Mifflin, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the traditional ''curriculums''.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;''[[OED]]'', 2nd edition, [[Oxford University Press]], 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DNS Certification Authority Authorization''' ('''CAA''') is an [[Internet security]] policy mechanism which allows [[domain name]] holders to indicate to [[certificate authorities]] whether they are authorized to issue [[digital certificates]] for a particular [[domain name]]. It does this by means of a new "CAA" [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) [[resource record]]. 

It was drafted by computer scientists [[Phillip Hallam-Baker]] and Rob Stradling in response to increasing concerns about the security of publicly trusted certificate authorities. It is an [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) [[Internet Standard#Proposed Standard|proposed standard]].

The first draft of CAA was written by [[Phillip Hallam-Baker]] and Rob Stradling, and submitted as an [[IETF]] [[Internet Draft]] in October 2010.&lt;ref name="draft-hallambaker-donotissue-00"&gt;{{Cite IETF|title=DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record|draft=draft-hallambaker-donotissue-00|last1=Hallam-Baker|first1=Phillip|authorlink1=Phillip Hallam-Baker|last2=Stradling|first2=Rob|date=October 18, 2010|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was progressively improved by the [[X.509#PKIX Working Group|PKIX Working Group]],&lt;ref name="draft-ietf-pkix-caa-00"&gt;{{Cite IETF|title=DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record|draft=draft-ietf-pkix-caa-00|last1=Hallam-Baker|first1=Phillip|authorlink1=Phillip Hallam-Baker|last2=Stradling|first2=Rob|last3=Ben|first3=Laurie|authorlink3=Ben Laurie|date=June 2, 2011|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and submitted to the [[IESG]] as {{IETF RFC|6844}}, a [[Internet Standard#Proposed Standard|Proposed Standard]], in January 2013.&lt;ref name="rfc6844"&gt;{{Cite IETF|title=DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record|rfc=6844|last1=Hallam-Baker|first1=Phillip|authorlink1=Phillip Hallam-Baker|last2=Stradling|first2=Rob|date=January 2013|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|doi=10.17487/RFC6844|issn=2070-1721}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CA/Browser Forum]] discussion began shortly afterwards,&lt;ref name="sigcomm2017" /&gt; and in March 2017 they voted in favor of making CAA implementation mandatory for all certificate authorities by September 2017.&lt;ref name="cab2017"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/2017-March/009988.html|title=Results on Ballot 187 - Make CAA Checking Mandatory|last=Hall|first=Kirk|date=March 8, 2017|publisher=[[CA/Browser Forum]]|access-date=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalsign2017"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/what-is-certificate-authority-authorization-checking/|title=What is CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization)?|last=Beattie|first=Doug|date=August 22, 2017|website=[[GlobalSign]]|language=en|access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one certificate authority, [[Comodo Group|Comodo]], failed to implement CAA before the deadline.&lt;ref name="bleepingcomputer2017"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/comodo-caught-breaking-new-caa-standard-one-day-after-it-went-into-effect/|title=Comodo Caught Breaking New CAA Standard One Day After It Went Into Effect|last=Cimpanu|first=Catalin|date=September 11, 2017|work=[[Bleeping Computer]]|access-date=January 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study by the [[Technical University of Munich]] found many instances where certificate authorities failed to correctly implement some part of the standard.&lt;ref name="sigcomm2017"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheitle|first=Quirin|last2=Chung|first2=Taejoong|last3=Hiller|first3=Jens|last4=Gasser|first4=Oliver|last5=Naab|first5=Johannes|last6=van Rijswijk-Deij|first6=Roland|last7=Hohlfeld|first7=Oliver|last8=Holz|first8=Ralph|last9=Choffnes|first9=Dave|last10=Alan|first10=Mislove|last11=Carle|first11=Georg|display-authors=2|date=April 2018|title=A First Look at Certification Authority Authorization (CAA)|url=https://ccronline.sigcomm.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sigcomm-ccr-final163.pdf|journal=ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review|volume=48|issue=2|pages=10–23|doi=10.1145/3213232.3213235|issn=0146-4833}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{As of|2018|June}}, [[Qualys]] reports that still only 3.4% of the 150,000 most popular [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]-supporting websites use CAA records.&lt;ref name="ssllabs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssllabs.com/ssl-pulse/|title=SSL Pulse|date=June 3, 2018|website=SSL Labs|publisher=[[Qualys]]|access-date=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Record ==
Certificate authorities implementing CAA perform a [[Domain Name System|DNS]] lookup for CAA [[resource record]]s, and if any are found, ensure that they are listed as an authorized party before issuing a [[digital certificate]].&lt;ref name="rfc6844" /&gt; Each CAA resource record consists of the following components, separated by whitespace:&lt;ref name="rfc6844" /&gt;
; flag : A [[flag (computing)|flags byte]] which implements an [[extensible]] signaling system for future use. {{As of|2018}}, only the ''issuer critical'' flag has been defined, which instructs certificate authorities that they must understand the corresponding property tag before issuing a certificate.&lt;ref name="rfc6844" /&gt; This flag allows the protocol to be extended in the future with mandatory extensions,&lt;ref name="sigcomm2017" /&gt; similar to [[X.509#Structure of a certificate|critical extensions in X.509 certificates]].
; tag : One of the following property:
:; issue : This property authorizes the holder of the domain specified in associated property value to issue certificates for the domain for which the property is published.
:; issuewild : This property acts like ''issue'' but only authorizes issuance of [[wildcard certificate]]s, and takes precedence over the ''issue'' property for wildcard certificate requests.
:; iodef : This property specifies a method for certificate authorities to report invalid certificate requests to the domain name holder using the [[Incident Object Description Exchange Format]]. {{As of|2018}}, not all certificate authorities support this tag, so there is no guarantee that all certificate issuances will be reported.
; value: The value associated with the chosen property tag.

The lack of any CAA records authorizes normal unrestricted issuance, and the presence of a single blank ''issue'' tag disallows all issuance.&lt;ref name="rfc6844" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalsign2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="symantec"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.websecurity.symantec.com/security-topics/what-is-certificate-authority-authorization|title=What is Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA)?|website=[[Symantec]]|access-date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third parties monitoring certificate authority behavior might check newly issued certificates against the domain's CAA records, but must be aware that a domain's CAA records may have changed between the time the certificate was issued and the time the third-party checks them. Clients should not use CAA as part of their certificate validation process.&lt;ref name="rfc6844" /&gt;

== Extensions ==
A draft of the first extension to the CAA standard was published on October 26, 2016, proposing a new ''account-uri'' token to the end of the ''issue'' property, which ties a domain to a specific [[Automated Certificate Management Environment]] account.&lt;ref name="draft-ietf-acme-caa-00"&gt;{{Cite IETF|title=CAA Record Extensions for Account URI and ACME Method Binding|draft=draft-ietf-acme-caa-00|last1=Landau|first1=Hugo|date=October 26, 2016|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was amended on August 30, 2017, to also include a new ''validation-methods'' token, which ties a domain to a specific validation method,&lt;ref name="draft-ietf-acme-caa-04"&gt;{{Cite IETF|title=CAA Record Extensions for Account URI and ACME Method Binding|draft=draft-ietf-acme-caa-04|last1=Landau|first1=Hugo|date=August 30, 2017|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then further amended on June 21, 2018 to remove the hyphen in ''account-uri'' and ''validation-methods'' making them instead ''accounturi'' and ''validationmethods''.&lt;ref name="draft-ietf-acme-caa-05"&gt;{{Cite IETF|title=CAA Record Extensions for Account URI and ACME Method Binding|draft=draft-ietf-acme-caa-05|last1=Landau|first1=Hugo|date=June 21, 2018|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
To indicate that only the certificate authority identified by ''ca.example.net'' is authorised to issue certificates for [[example.com]] and all subdomains, one may use this CAA record:&lt;ref name="rfc6844" /&gt;

 example.com.  IN  CAA 0 issue "ca.example.net"

To disallow any certificate issuance, one may allow issuance only to an empty issuer list:

 example.com.  IN  CAA  0 issue ";"

To indicate that certificate authorities should report invalid certificate requests to an [[email address]] and a [[Real-time Inter-network Defense]] endpoint:

&lt;pre&gt;
example.com.  IN  CAA 0 iodef "mailto:security@example.com"
example.com.  IN  CAA 0 iodef "http://iodef.example.com/"
&lt;/pre&gt;

To use a future extension of the protocol, for example one which defines a new ''future'' property, which needs to be understood by the certificate authority before they can safely proceed, one may set the ''issuer critical'' flag:

 example.com.  IN  CAA  0 issue "ca.example.net"
 example.com.  IN  CAA  128 future "value"

'''DK''', formerly known as '''Dorling Kindersley''', is a British multinational [[publishing]] company specialising in illustrated reference books for adults and children in 62 languages.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;http://www.dk.com/uk/information/about-dk/&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is an imprint of [[Penguin Random House]], a subsidiary of German media conglomerate [[Bertelsmann]] and British publishing company [[Pearson plc]].

Established in 1974, DK publishes a range of titles in genres including travel (including [[Eyewitness Travel Guides]]), arts and crafts, business, history, cooking, gaming, gardening, health and fitness, natural history, parenting, science and reference. They also publish books for children, toddlers and babies, covering such topics as history, the human body, animals and activities, as well as licensed properties such as [[The Lego Group|LEGO]], [[Disney]] and DeLiSo, licensor of the toy [[Sophie la Girafe]]. 
DK has offices in New York, Melbourne, London, Munich, New Delhi and Toronto.

==History==
DK was founded as a book-packaging company by [[Christopher Dorling]] and [[Peter Kindersley]] in London in 1974, and in 1982 moved into publishing.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; The first book published under the DK name was a ''First Aid Manual'' for the British voluntary medical services; this book established the company's distinctive visual style of copiously illustrated text on a glossy white background. DK Inc. began publishing in the United States in 1991. That same year, [[Microsoft]] bought a 26 percent stake in DK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&amp;A/Microsoft_Corp_acquires_a_minority_stake_in_Dorling_Kindersley_Ltd-196674040 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803093908/http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M%26A/Microsoft_Corp_acquires_a_minority_stake_in_Dorling_Kindersley_Ltd-196674040 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-03 |title=Microsoft Corp acquires a minority stake in Dorling Kindersley Ltd |date=1991-03-18 |publisher=[[Thomson Financial]] |accessdate=2008-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 it overestimated the market for ''[[Star Wars]]'' books and was left with millions of unsold copies, resulting in crippling debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/616623.stm |website=www.bbc.co.uk |title=Star Wars book flop hits DK |date=24 January 2000 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a direct result, DK was taken over the following year by the [[Pearson plc]] media company and made part of [[Penguin Group]], which also owned the [[Penguin Books]] label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Charles Goldsmith |title=Media Giant Pearson Acquires U.K. Publisher Dorling Kindersley |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB954699553231714048 |accessdate=17 October 2015 |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc |date=3 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; DK has continued to sell ''Star Wars'' books after the takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Cover Stories: Political memoirs; the environmental Bible; Dorling Kindersley|publisher=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/cover-stories-political-memoirs-the-environmental-bible-dorling-kindersley-828940.html|author=The Literator|date=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Bertelsmann and Pearson completed a merger to form Penguin Random House.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bertelsmann And Pearson Complete Merger To Form Penguin Random House|publisher=The Random House Group|url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/news/2013/07/bertelsmann-and-pearson-complete-merger-to-form-penguin-random-house|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertelsmann owns 53% and Pearson 47% of the company. Penguin's trade publishing activity continued to include DK under the newly formed Penguin Random House.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=CEO Markus Dohle Announces Penguin Random House Global Leadership Team|publisher=Penguin Random House Group|url=http://global.penguinrandomhouse.com/press-release/ceo-markus-dohle-announces-penguin-random-house-global-leadership-team/|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DK publishes a range of titles internationally for adults and children. Most of the company's books are produced by teams of editors and designers who work with freelance writers and illustrators. Some are endorsed by "imprimaturs": well-known and respected organisations such as the [[British Medical Association]], the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] and the [[British Red Cross]]. Some DK books apparently produced by celebrity authors such as [[Carol Vorderman]] are actually ghostwritten by the company's own writers and editors.

===BradyGames===
BradyGames is a publishing company in the United States operating as a DK [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], which specializes in [[video game]] [[strategy guides]], covering multiple [[Video game console|video game platforms]]. It published their first strategy guide in November 1993 as a division of [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|MacMillan Computer Publishing]]. In 1998, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] (which acquired Macmillan in 1994) divested BradyGames as part of its educational division to [[Pearson plc]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/04/business/pearson-revises-simon-schuster-deal.html&lt;/ref&gt; BradyGames has grown to publish roughly 90-100 guides per year. On 1 June 2015, BradyGames merged with [[Prima Games]], and future strategy guides made by the publishing company will be published under the Prima Games label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Two big video game strategy guide makers become one|url = http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/1/8700953/prima-games-and-bradygames-merger|website = Polygon|accessdate = 2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DK Multimedia===
During the 1990s, the company published educational [[video]]s and a successful range of educational [[CD-ROM]]s under the brand ''DK Multimedia''. During the late 1990s CD-ROMs were rebranded as ''DK Interactive Learning'' to reflect a changed emphasis toward the educational sector. Following dwindling sales and increasing competition from [[website]]s, the company tried to rebrand the digital part of its business as ''DK Online'' before opting to sell the UK publishing rights to its CD-ROM backlist in 2000 to an entirely separate company, ''Global Software Publishing'', which is part of the [[Avanquest Software Group]]. The DK Online section of the business then transferred into development work on the anglicised version of the Pearson Education (US) KnowledgeBox product.

In December 2010 DK opened an [[app store]], selling digital versions of some of its books as well as products from other publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=James Quinn |title=Dorling Kindersley opens its own app shop  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/digital-media/8196164/Dorling-Kindersley-opens-its-own-app-shop.html |accessdate=17 October 2015 |work=The Telegraph |date=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stuart Dredge |title=Dorling Kindersley talks iPad, Android and its 'Darwinian' apps strategy  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/sep/07/dorling-kindersley-ipad-apps |accessdate=2 August 2016 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited  |work=The Guardian |date=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young adult===
DK commenced publishing books aimed at teens with the release of ''Heads Up Psychology'' in May 2014 and further titles following every two to three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-industry-news/article/62061-dk-enters-the-teen-market-with-nonfiction-line.html |website=www.publishersweekly.com |title=DK Enters the Teen Market with Nonfiction Line |author=Sally Lodge |date=29 April 2014|publisher=PWxyz LLC |accessdate=17 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reception of the first title was favorable with [[Publishers Weekly]] writing "Attention-getting headers ("Why do good people do bad things?" introduces a discussion of the human capacity for evil) should hook curious readers, while the findings of psychological studies should deepen their understanding of this field. Infographics, sidebars, and photos both create an inviting visual layout and underscore the concepts discussed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4654-1993-4 |website=www.publishersweekly.com |title=Heads Up Psychology |publisher=PWxyz LLC |accessdate=17 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Booklist]] called it an "attractive book" and "a busy but appealing companion for high-school psychology textbooks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/1922301/Reviews |website=www.buffalolib.org |title=Heads up psychology |publisher=Buffalo &amp; Eric County public Library |accessdate=17 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endianness''' refers to the sequential order in which [[byte]]s are arranged into larger numerical [[word (data type)|values]] when stored in [[Computer data storage|memory]] or when transmitted over digital links. Endianness is of interest in [[computer science]] because two conflicting and incompatible formats are in common use: [[Word (computer architecture)|words]] may be represented in '''big-endian''' or '''little-endian''' format, depending on whether bits or bytes or other components are ordered from the big end ([[most significant bit]]) or the little end ([[least significant bit]]). 

In big-endian format, whenever addressing memory or sending/storing words bytewise, the most significant byte—the byte containing the [[most significant bit]]—is stored first (has the lowest address) or sent first, then the following bytes are stored or sent in decreasing significance order, with the least significant byte—the one containing the [[least significant bit]]—stored last (having the highest address) or sent last.

Little-endian format reverses this order: the sequence addresses/sends/stores the least significant byte first (lowest address) and the most significant byte last (highest address). Most computer systems prefer a single format for all its data; using the system's native format is automatic. But when reading memory or receiving transmitted data from a different computer system, it is often required to process and translate data between the preferred native endianness format to the opposite format. 

The order of bits within a byte or word can also have endianness (as discussed later); however, a byte is typically handled as a single numerical value or character symbol and so bit sequence order is obviated.

Both big and little forms of endianness are widely used in digital electronics. The choice of endianness for a new design is often arbitrary, but later technology revisions and updates perpetuate the existing endianness and many other design attributes to maintain [[backward compatibility]]. As examples, the IBM [[z/Architecture]] mainframes and the [[Motorola 68000 series]] use big-endian while the Intel [[x86]] processors use little-endian. The designers of [[System/360]], the ancestor of z/Architecture, chose its endianness in the 1960s; the designers of the [[Motorola 68000]] and the [[Intel 8086]], the first members of the 68000 and x86 families, chose their endianness in the 1970s.

Big-endian is the most common format in data networking; fields in the protocols of the [[Internet protocol suite]], such as [[IPv4]], [[IPv6]], [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]], are transmitted in big-endian order. For this reason, big-endian byte order is also referred to as '''network byte order'''. Little-endian storage is popular for microprocessors, in part due to significant influence on microprocessor designs by [[Intel]] Corporation. Mixed forms also exist; for instance, in VAX floating point, the ordering of bytes in a 16-bit word differs from the ordering of 16-bit words within a 32-bit word. Such cases are sometimes referred to as '''mixed-endian''' or '''middle-endian'''. There are also some '''[[#Bi-endianness|bi-endian]]''' processors that operate in either little-endian or big-endian mode.

==Illustration==

[[Image:Big-Endian.svg|200px|Big-Endian|right]]
[[Image:Little-Endian.svg|200px|Little-Endian|right]]
The following two descriptive illustrations assume a normal reading and writing convention of ''left to right'', where the left-most digit or character therefore corresponds to data being "sent" (or "received") first, or being in the ''lowest address in memory,'' and the right-most digit or character corresponds to the data being sent or received last, or being in the ''highest'' address in memory.

Big-endianness may be demonstrated by writing a decimal number, say one hundred twenty-three, on paper in the usual [[positional notation]] understood by a numerate reader: ''123''. The digits are written starting from the left and to the right, with the most significant digit, ''1'', written first. This is analogous to the lowest [[memory address|address of memory]] being used first. This is an example of a big-endian convention taken from daily life.

The little-endian way of writing the same number, one hundred twenty-three, would place the hundreds-digit ''1'' in the right-most position: ''321''. A person following conventional big-endian place-value order, who is not aware of this special ordering, would read a different number: three hundred and twenty one. Endianness in computing is similar, but it usually applies to the ordering of bytes, rather than of digits.

The illustrations to the right, where ''a'' is a memory address, show big-endian and little-endian storage in memory.

==Etymology==
[[Danny Cohen (engineer)|Danny Cohen]] introduced the terms Little-Endian and Big-Endian for byte ordering in an article from 1980.&lt;ref name="HOLY"&gt;{{cite IETF

==Hardware==
[[Computer memory]] consists of a sequence of storage cells. Each cell is identified in hardware and software by its [[memory address]]. If the total number of storage cells in memory is ''n'', then addresses are enumerated from ''0'' to ''n-1''. Computer programs often use data structures of [[Field (computer science)|fields]] that may consist of more data than is stored in one memory cell. For the purpose of this article where its use as an operand of an instruction is relevant, a field consists of a consecutive sequence of [[byte]]s and represents a simple data value. In addition to that, it has to be of numeric type in some [[Positional notation|positional number system]] (mostly base-10 or base-2 – or base-256 in case of 8-bit bytes).&lt;ref&gt;When character (text) strings are compared with one another, this is done [[Lexicographical order|lexicographically]] where a single positional element (character) also has a positional value. Lexicographical comparison means almost everywhere: first character ranks highest – as in the telephone book. This would have the consequence that almost every machine would be big-endian or at least mixed-endian. Therefore, for the criterion below to apply, the data type in question has to be ''numeric''.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a number system the "value" of a digit is determined not only by its value as a single digit, but also by the position it holds in the complete number, its "significance". These positions can be mapped to memory mainly in two ways:&lt;ref name="TanenbaumAustin2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew S. Tanenbaum|author2=Todd M.

*increasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or increasing time), known as ''little-endian'', and
*decreasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or increasing time), known as ''big-endian''&lt;ref&gt;Note that, in these expressions, the term "end" is meant as "extremity", not as "last part"; and that (the extremity with) ''big'' resp. ''little'' significance is written ''first''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

While the little-endian Intel [[microprocessor]] product line became a popular architecture, many historical and extant processors use a big-endian memory representation, commonly referred to as [[Endianness#Networking|network order]], as used in the [[Internet protocol suite]], either exclusively or as a design option; others use yet another scheme called "[[Endianness#Middle|middle-endian]]", "mixed-endian" or "[[PDP-11]]-endian".

The [[IBM System/360]] uses big-endian byte order, as do its successors [[System/370]], [[ESA/390]], and [[z/Architecture]]. The [[PDP-10]] also uses big-endian addressing for byte-oriented instructions.  The [[IBM Series/1]] minicomputer also use big-endian byte order.

Dealing with data of different endianness is sometimes termed the ''NUXI problem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology alludes to the byte order conflicts encountered while [[Porting|adapting]] [[UNIX]], which ran on the mixed-endian PDP-11, to a big-endian IBM Series/1 computer. Unix was one of the first systems to allow the same code to be compiled for platforms with different internal representations. One of the first programs converted was supposed to print out ''Unix'', but on the Series/1 it printed ''nUxi'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jalics|first1=Paul J.|last2=Heines|first2=Thomas S.|title=Transporting a portable operating system: UNIX to an IBM minicomputer|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1 December 1983|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1066–1072|doi=10.1145/358476.358504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Datapoint 2200]] uses simple bit-serial logic with little-endian to facilitate [[carry propagation]]. When Intel developed the [[Intel 8008|8008]] microprocessor for Datapoint, they used little-endian for compatibility. However, as Intel was unable to deliver the 8008 in time, Datapoint used a [[medium scale integration]] equivalent, but the little-endianness was retained in most Intel designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=House|first=David|title=Oral History Panel on the Development and Promotion  of the Intel 8008 Microprocessor|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Intel_8008/Intel_8008_1.oral_history.2006.102657982.pdf#page=5|publisher=[[Computer History Museum]]|accessdate=23 April 2014|author2=Faggin, Federico |author3=Feeney, Hal |author4=Gelbach, Ed |author5=Hoff, Ted |author6=Mazor, Stan |author7= Smith, Hank |page=5|date=2006-09-21|quote=Mazor: And lastly, the original design for Datapoint... what they wanted was a [bit] serial machine. And if you think about a  serial machine, you have to process all the addresses and data one-bit at a time, and the rational way to  do that is: low-bit to high-bit because that’s the way that carry would propagate. So it means that [in] the jump instruction itself, the way the 14-bit address would be put in a serial machine is bit-backwards, as  you look at it, because that’s the way you’d want to process it. Well, we were gonna built a byte-parallel  machine, not bit-serial and our compromise (in the spirit of the customer and just for him), we put the  bytes in backwards. We put the low-byte [first] and then the high-byte. This has since been dubbed  “Little Endian” format and it’s sort of contrary to what you’d think would be natural. Well, we did it for  Datapoint. As you’ll see, they never did use the [8008] chip and so it was in some sense “a mistake”, but  that [Little Endian format] has lived on to the 8080 and 8086 and [is] one of the marks of this family.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lunde2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Lunde|title=CJKV Information Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SA92uQqTB-AC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=21 May 2013|date=13 January 2009|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-0-596-51447-1|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel [[MCS-48]] is also little-endian, as are the well-known [[DEC Alpha]], [[Atmel AVR]], [[VAX]] and many more.

The Motorola [[Motorola 6800|6800]] / 6801, the [[6809]] and the [[68000]] series of processors used the big-endian format, and for this reason, it is also known as the "''Motorola convention''".&lt;ref name="Kueveler-Schwoch_1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kueveler-Schwoch_2007"/&gt;

The Intel [[8051]], contrary to other Intel processors, expects 16-bit addresses for LJMP and LCALL in big-endian format; however, xCALL instructions store the return address onto the stack in little-endian format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/c51/c51_xe.htm|title=Cx51 User's Guide: E. Byte Ordering|website=keil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SPARC]] historically used big-endian until version 9, which is [[#Bi-endianness|bi-endian]]; similarly early IBM POWER processors were big-endian, but now the [[PowerPC]] and [[Power Architecture]] descendants are bi-endian. The [[ARM architecture]] was little-endian before version 3 when it became [[#Bi-endianness|bi-endian]].

Other well-known little-endian processor architectures include [[MOS Technology 6502]] (including [[Western Design Center]] [[65802]] and [[65C816]]), Zilog [[Z80]] (including [[Z180]] and [[eZ80]]) and [[Altera]] [[Nios II]].

===Current architectures===
The Intel [[x86]] and also AMD64 / [[x86-64]] series of processors use the '''little-endian''' format, and for this reason, it is also known in the industry as the "''Intel convention''".&lt;ref name="Kueveler-Schwoch_1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Arbeitsbuch Informatik - eine praxisorientierte Einführung in die Datenverarbeitung mit Projektaufgabe|language=German|first1=Gerd|last1=Küveler|first2=Dietrich|last2=Schwoch|date=2013|orig-year=1996|publisher=Vieweg-Verlag, reprint: Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-3-528-04952-2|id=9783322929075|doi=10.1007/978-3-322-92907-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8-dBgAAQBAJ|accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kueveler-Schwoch_2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Informatik für Ingenieure und Naturwissenschaftler: PC- und Mikrocomputertechnik, Rechnernetze|language=German|first1=Gerd|last1=Küveler|first2=Dietrich|last2=Schwoch|date=2007-10-04|publisher=Vieweg, reprint: Springer-Verlag|edition=5|volume=2|isbn=3834891916|id=9783834891914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQbvPYxceY0C|accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some current '''big-endian''' architectures include the IBM [[z/Architecture]], [[Freescale ColdFire]] (which is [[Motorola 68000 series]]-based), Xilinx [[MicroBlaze]], Atmel [[AVR32]].

As a consequence of its original implementation on the Intel 8080 platform, the operating system-independent [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system is defined to use little-endian byte ordering, even on platforms using other endiannesses natively.

===Bi-endianness===
&lt;!-- Yes, that's bi, not big. "Bi" here means "both of them", i.e. switchable between big- &amp; little-endianness. --&gt;
Some architectures (including [[ARM architecture|ARM]] versions 3 and above, [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[SPARC]] V9, [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PA-RISC]], [[SuperH|SuperH SH-4]] and [[IA-64]]) feature a setting which allows for switchable endianness in data fetches and stores, instruction fetches, or both. This feature can improve performance or simplify the logic of networking devices and software. The word ''bi-endian'', when said of hardware, denotes the capability of the machine to compute or pass data in either endian format.

Many of these architectures can be switched via software to default to a specific endian format (usually done when the computer starts up); however, on some systems the default endianness is selected by hardware on the motherboard and cannot be changed via software (e.g. the Alpha, which runs only in big-endian mode on the [[Cray T3E]]).

Note that the term "bi-endian" refers primarily to how a processor treats ''data'' accesses. ''Instruction'' accesses (fetches of instruction words) on a given processor may still assume a fixed endianness, even if ''data'' accesses are fully bi-endian, though this is not always the case, such as on Intel's [[IA-64]]-based Itanium CPU, which allows both.

Note, too, that some nominally bi-endian CPUs require motherboard help to fully switch endianness. For instance, the 32-bit desktop-oriented [[PowerPC]] processors in little-endian mode act as little-endian from the point of view of the executing programs, but they require the motherboard to perform a 64-bit swap across all 8 byte lanes to ensure that the little-endian view of things will apply to [[Input/Output|I/O]] devices. In the absence of this unusual motherboard hardware, device driver software must write to different addresses to undo the incomplete transformation and also must perform a normal byte swap.

Some CPUs, such as many PowerPC processors intended for embedded use and almost all SPARC processors, allow per-page choice of endianness.

SPARC processors since the late 1990s ("SPARC v9" compliant processors) allow data endianness to be chosen with each individual instruction that loads from or stores to memory.

Many processors have instructions to convert a word in a register to the opposite endianness, that is, they swap the order of the bytes in a 16-, 32- or 64-bit word. All the individual bits are not reversed though.

Recent Intel x86 and x86-64 architecture CPUs have a MOVBE instruction ([[Intel Core]] since generation 4, after [[Intel Atom|Atom]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to detect New Instruction support in the 4th generation Intel® Core™ processor family|url=https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/405250/how-to-detect-new-instruction-support-in-the-4th-generation-intel-core-processor-family.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which fetches a big-endian format word from memory or writes a word into memory in big-endian format. These processors are otherwise thoroughly little-endian. They also already had a range of swap instructions to reverse the byte order of the contents of registers, such as when words have already been fetched from memory locations where they were in the 'wrong' endianness.

[[ZFS]]/[[OpenZFS]] combined [[file system]] and [[Logical volume management|logical volume manager]] is known to provide adaptive endianness and to work with both big-endian and little-endian systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Documentation/Read_Write_Lecture |title=FreeBSD Kernel Internals: An Intensive Code Walkthrough |author=Matt Ahrens |year=2016 |publisher=OpenZFS Documentation/Read Write Lecture }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floating point===
&lt;!-- This section is transcluded on the [[Double-precision floating point]] article --&gt;
&lt;section begin="Floating-point" /&gt;
Although the ubiquitous x86 processors of today use little-endian storage for all types of data (integer, floating point, [[binary coded decimal|BCD]]), there are a number of hardware architectures where [[floating-point]] numbers are represented in big-endian form while integers are represented in little-endian form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Floating-Point Formats |author-first=John J. G. |author-last=Savard |date=2018 |orig-year=2005 |work=quadibloc |url=http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/cp0201.htm |access-date=2018-07-16 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703001709/http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/cp0201.htm |archive-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processors that have half little-endian, half big-endian floating-point representation for double-precision numbers: both 32-bit words are stored in little-endian like integer registers, but the most significant one first. Because there have been many floating-point formats with no "[[Computer network|network]]" standard representation for them, the [[External Data Representation|XDR]] standard uses big-endian IEEE 754 as its representation. It may therefore appear strange that the widespread [[IEEE 754]] floating-point standard does not specify endianness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pack – convert a list into a binary representation |url=http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlfunc/pack.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, this means that even standard IEEE floating-point data written by one machine might not be readable by another. However, on modern standard computers (i.e., implementing IEEE 754), one may in practice safely assume that the endianness is the same for floating-point numbers as for integers, making the conversion straightforward regardless of data type. (Small [[embedded system]]s using special floating-point formats may be another matter however.)&lt;section end="Floating-point" /&gt;

===Optimization===
The little-endian system has the property that the same value can be read from memory at different lengths without using different addresses (even when [[byte alignment|alignment]] restrictions are imposed). For example, a 32-bit memory location with content 4A 00 00 00 can be read at the same address as either [[8-bit]] (value = 4A), [[16-bit]] (004A), [[24-bit]] (00004A), or [[32-bit]] (0000004A), all of which retain the same numeric value. Although this little-endian property is rarely used directly by high-level programmers, it is often employed by code optimizers as well as by [[assembly language]] programmers.
In more concrete terms, such optimizations are the equivalent of the following C code returning true on most little-endian systems:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
union u_t {
  uint8_t u8; uint16_t u16; uint32_t u32; uint64_t u64;
} u = { .u64 = 0x4A };
puts(u.u8 == u.u16 &amp;&amp; u.u8 == u.u32 &amp;&amp; u.u8 == u.u64 ? "true" : "false");
&lt;/source&gt;

While not allowed by C++, such [[Type punning]] code is allowed as "implementation-defined" by the C11 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=C11 standard |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/57853.html |publisher=ISO |accessdate=15 August 2018 |page=Section 6.5.2.3 "Structure and Union members", §3 and footnote 95 |quote=95) If the member used to read the contents of a union object is not the same as the member last used to store a value in the object, the appropriate part of the object representation of the value is reinterpreted as an object representation in the new type as described in 6.2.6 (a process sometimes called ‘‘type punning’’).}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3.10 Options That Control Optimization: -fstrict-aliasing |url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Type-punning |website=GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in code interacting with hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |first=Linus |last=Torvalds |title=[GIT PULL] Device properties framework update for v4.18-rc1 |url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/6/5/769 |mailing-list=Linux Kernel|accessdate=15 August 2018 | date=5 Jun 2018 |quote=The fact is, using a union to do type punning is the traditional AND STANDARD way to do type punning in gcc. In fact, it is the *documented* way to do it for gcc, when you are a f*cking moron and use "-fstrict-aliasing" ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in some situations it may be useful to obtain an approximation of a multi-byte or multi-word value by reading only its most significant portion instead of the complete representation; a big-endian processor may read such an approximation using the same base-address that would be used for the full value.

===Calculation order===
Little-endian representation simplifies hardware in processors that add multi-byte integral values a byte at a time, such as small-scale byte-addressable processors and [[microcontroller]]s. As carry propagation must start at the least significant bit (and thus byte), multi-byte addition can then be carried out with a monotonically-incrementing address sequence, a simple operation already present in hardware. On a big-endian processor, its addressing unit has to be told how big the addition is going to be so that it can hop forward to the least significant byte, then count back down towards the most significant byte (MSB). On the other hand, arithmetic division is done starting from the MSB, so it is more natural for big-endian processors. However, high-performance processors usually fetch typical multi-byte operands from memory in the same amount of time they would have fetched a single byte, so the complexity of the hardware is not affected by the byte ordering.

|colspan="14" | &lt;small&gt;A simple way to remember is "In {{em|L}}ittle Endian, the {{em|L}}east significant byte goes into the {{em|L}}owest-addressed slot".&lt;br /&gt;So in the example in the table, &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, the least significant byte, in a Little-Endian system goes into slot +0.&lt;/small&gt;
|}

We can assume that as we write text ''left to right'', we are increasing the 'address' on paper, as a processor would write bytes with increasing memory addresses &amp;mdash; as in the adjacent table. On paper, the hex value 0a0b0c0d (written 168496141 in usual decimal notation) is big-endian style since we write the most significant digit first and the rest follow in '''''de'''creasing'' significance. Mapping this number as a binary value to a sequence of 4 bytes in memory in big-endian style also writes the bytes from ''left to right'' in '''''de'''creasing'' significance: &lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +0, &lt;tt&gt;0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +1, &lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +2, &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +3.

On a little-endian system, the bytes are written from ''left to right'' in '''''in'''creasing'' significance, starting with the one's byte: &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +0, &lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +1, &lt;tt&gt;0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +2, &lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +3. Writing a 32-bit binary value to a memory location on a little-endian system and outputting the memory location (with growing addresses from left to right) shows that the order is ''reversed'' (byte-swapped) compared to usual big-endian notation. This is the way a [[hexdump]] is displayed: because the dumping program is unable to know what kind of data it is dumping, the only orientation it can observe is monotonically increasing addresses. The human reader, however, who knows that they are reading a hexdump of a little-endian system and who knows what kind of data they are reading, reads the byte sequence &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; as the 32-bit binary value 168496141, or 0x0a0b0c0d in hexadecimal notation. (Of course, this is ''not'' the same as the number &lt;tt&gt;0D0C0B0A&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = 0x0d0c0b0a = 218893066.)

==Examples==
This section provides example layouts of the 32-bit number 0A0B0C0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; in the most common variants of endianness. There exist several digital processors that use other formats. That is true for typical [[embedded system]]s as well as for general computer CPUs. Most processors used in non CPU roles in typical computers (in storage units, peripherals etc.) also use one of these two basic formats, although not always 32-bit.

The examples refer to the storage in memory of the value. It uses [[hexadecimal]] notation.

The [[least significant byte]] (LSB) value, &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, is at the lowest address. The other bytes follow in increasing order of significance. This is akin to right-to-left reading in hexadecimal order.

====When organized by byte addresses====
; Byte addresses increasing from right to left
Visualising memory addresses from left to right makes little-endian values appear backwards. If the addresses are written increasing ''towards'' the left instead, each individual little-endian value will appear forwards. However strings of values or characters appear reversed instead.

With 8-bit atomic elements:

|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;" | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The [[least significant byte]] (LSB) value, &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, is at the lowest address. The other bytes follow in increasing order of significance.

|-
| colspan="6" |←&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''increasing addresses''
|-
|style="border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;"  | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0A0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0C0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;" | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The least significant 16-bit unit stores the value &lt;tt&gt;0C0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, immediately followed by &lt;tt&gt;0A0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

The display of text is reversed from the normal display of languages such as English that read from left to right. For example, the word "XRAY" displayed in this manner, with each character stored in an 8-bit atomic element:

{| cellpadding="4" style="border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;"
|-
| colspan="6" |←&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''increasing addresses''
|-
|style="border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;"  | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"Y"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"A"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"R"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"X"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;" | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

If pairs of characters are stored in 16-bit atomic elements (using 8 bits per character), it could look even stranger:

{| cellpadding="4" style="border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;"
|-
| colspan="4" |←&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''increasing addresses''
|-
|style="border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;"  | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"AY"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"XR"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;" | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

This conflict between the memory arrangements of binary data and text is intrinsic to the nature of the little-endian convention, but is a conflict only for languages written left-to-right, such as English. For right-to-left languages such as [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]], there is no conflict of text with binary, and the preferred display in both cases would be with addresses increasing to the left. (On the other hand, right-to-left languages have a complementary intrinsic conflict in the big-endian system.)

==={{anchor|Middle|Mixed|Medium}}Middle-endian===
Numerous other orderings, generically called ''middle-endian'' or ''mixed-endian'', are possible. On the [[PDP-11]] (16-bit little-endian), for example, the instructions to convert between floating-point and integer values in the optional floating-point processor on the PDP-11/45&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/handbooks/PDP1145_Handbook_1973.pdf|title=PDP-11/45 Processor Handbook|page=165|year=1973|publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PDP-11/70, and in some later processors, stored 32-bit "double precision integer long" values  with the 16-bit halves swapped from the expected little-endian order, and the [[UNIX]] [[C (programming language)|C]] compiler used the same format for 32-bit long integers. This ordering is known as ''PDP-endian''.

|style="border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;" | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The [[ARM architecture]] can also produce this format when writing a 32-bit word to an address 2 bytes from a 32-bit word [[data structure alignment|alignment]].

[[Segment descriptors]] on [[Intel 80386]] and compatible processors keep a 32-bit base address of the segment stored in little-endian order, but in four nonconsecutive bytes, at relative positions 2, 3, 4 and 7 of the descriptor start.

==Files and byte swap==
Endianness is a problem when a binary file created on a computer is read on another computer with different endianness. Some [[CPU]] instruction sets provide native support for endian byte swapping, such as ''bswap''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual Volume 2 (2A, 2B &amp; 2C): Instruction Set Reference, A-Z|at=p. 3–112|publisher=Intel|date=September 2016|accessdate=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[x86]] - [[Intel 80486|486]] and later), and ''rev''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0487a.k_10775/index.html|title=ARMv8-A Reference Manual|publisher=[[ARM Holdings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[ARM architecture|ARMv6]] and later).

Some [[compiler]]s have built-in facilities to deal with data written in other formats. For example, the [[Intel]] [[Fortran]] compiler supports the non-standard &lt;code&gt;CONVERT&lt;/code&gt; specifier, so a file can be opened as
:&lt;code&gt;OPEN(unit,CONVERT='BIG_ENDIAN',...)&lt;/code&gt;
or
:&lt;code&gt;OPEN(unit,CONVERT='LITTLE_ENDIAN',...)&lt;/code&gt;
Some compilers have options to generate code that globally enables the conversion for all file IO operations. This allows programmers to reuse code on a system with the opposite endianness without having to modify the code itself. If the compiler does not support such conversion, the programmer needs to swap the bytes via ad hoc code.

Fortran sequential unformatted files created with one endianness usually cannot be read on a system using the other endianness because Fortran usually implements a [[storage record|record]] (defined as the data written by a single Fortran statement) as data preceded and succeeded by count fields, which are integers equal to the number of bytes in the data. An attempt to read such file on a system of the other endianness then results in a run-time error, because the count fields are incorrect. This problem can be avoided by writing out sequential binary files as opposed to sequential unformatted.

[[Unicode]] text can optionally start with a [[byte order mark]] (BOM) to signal the endianness of the file or stream. Its code point is U+FEFF. In [[UTF-32]] for example, a big-endian file should start with &lt;code&gt;00 00 FE FF&lt;/code&gt;; a little-endian should start with &lt;code&gt;FF FE 00 00&lt;/code&gt;.

Application binary data formats, such as for example [[MATLAB]] .mat files, or the .BIL data format, used in topography, are usually endianness-independent. This is achieved by:
# storing the data always in one fixed endianness, or 
# carrying with the data a switch to indicate which endianness the data was written with. 
When reading the file, the application converts the endianness, invisibly from the user. 
An example of the first case is the binary [[XLS file]] format that is portable between Windows and Mac systems and always little endian, leaving the Mac application to swap the bytes on load and save when running on a big-endian Motorola 68K or PowerPC processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/B/E/0BE8BDD7-E5E8-422A-ABFD-4342ED7AD886/Excel97-2007BinaryFileFormat(xls)Specification.xps |title=Microsoft Office Excel 97 - 2007 Binary File Format Specification (*.xls 97-2007 format) |year=2007 |publisher=Microsoft Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TIFF]] image files are an example of the second strategy, whose header instructs the application about endianness of their internal binary integers. If a file starts with the signature "&lt;code&gt;MM&lt;/code&gt;" it means that integers are represented as big-endian, while "&lt;code&gt;II&lt;/code&gt;" means little-endian. Those signatures need a single 16-bit word each, and they are [[palindrome]]s (that is, they read the same forwards and backwards), so they are endianness independent. "&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;" stands for [[Intel]] and "&lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;" stands for [[Motorola]], the respective [[CPU]] providers of the [[IBM PC]] compatibles (Intel) and [[Apple Macintosh]] platforms (Motorola) in the 1980s. Intel CPUs are little-endian, while Motorola 680x0 CPUs are big-endian. This explicit signature allows a TIFF reader program to swap bytes if necessary when a given file was generated by a TIFF writer program running on a computer with a different endianness.

Since the required byte swap depends on the size of the numbers stored in the file (two 2-byte integers require a different swap than one 4-byte integer), the file format must be known to perform endianness conversion.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;

    result |= (value &amp; 0xFF000000) &gt;&gt; 24;
    return result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Networking==
Many [[IETF RFC]]s use the term ''network order'', meaning the order of transmission for bits and bytes ''over the wire'' in [[network protocols]]. Among others, the historic RFC 1700 (also known as [[Internet standard]] STD 2) has defined the network order for protocols in the [[Internet protocol suite]] to be [[#Big-endian|big-endian]], hence the use of the term "network byte order" for big-endian byte order; however, not all protocols use big-endian byte order as the network order.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Berkeley sockets]] [[application programming interface|API]] defines a set of functions to convert 16-bit and 32-bit integers to and from network byte order: the &lt;tt&gt;htons&lt;/tt&gt; (host-to-network-short) and &lt;tt&gt;htonl&lt;/tt&gt; (host-to-network-long) functions convert 16-bit and 32-bit values respectively from machine (''host'') to network order; the &lt;tt&gt;ntohs&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ntohl&lt;/tt&gt; functions convert from network to host order. These functions may be a [[no-op]] on a big-endian system.

In [[CANopen]], multi-byte parameters are always sent [[least significant byte]] first (little endian). The same is true for [[Ethernet Powerlink]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethernet POWERLINK Standardisation Group (2012), ''EPSG Working Draft Proposal 301: Ethernet POWERLINK Communication Profile Specification Version 1.1.4'', chapter 6.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the high-level network protocols usually consider the byte (mostly meant as ''[[octet (computing)|octet]]'') as their atomic unit, the lowest network protocols may deal with ordering of bits within a byte.

==Bit endianness==
[[Bit numbering]] is a concept similar to endianness, but on a level of bits, not bytes. ''Bit endianness'' or ''bit-level endianness'' refers to the transmission order of bits over a serial medium. The bit-level analogue of little-endian (least significant bit goes first) is used in [[RS-232]], [[HDLC]], [[Ethernet]], and [[USB]]. Some protocols use the opposite ordering (e.g. [[Teletext]], [[I²C]], [[SMBus]], [[PMBus]], and [[synchronous optical networking|SONET and SDH]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Sec. 2.1 Bit Transmission of [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pppext-sonet-as-00 draft-ietf-pppext-sonet-as-00 "Applicability Statement for PPP over SONET/SDH"]&lt;/ref&gt;). Usually, there exists a consistent view to the bits irrespective of their order in the byte, such that the latter becomes relevant only on a very low level. One exception is caused by the feature of some [[cyclic redundancy check]]s to detect ''all'' [[burst error]]s up to a known length, which would be spoiled if the bit order is different from the byte order on serial transmission.

Apart from serialization, the terms ''bit endianness'' and ''bit-level endianness'' are seldom used, as computer architectures where each individual bit has a unique address are rare. Individual bits or [[bit field]]s are accessed via their numerical value or, in high-level programming languages, assigned names, the effects of which, however, may be machine dependent or lack [[software portability]]. The natural numbering is that the [[arithmetic left shift]] 1&lt;&lt;''n'' yields a mask for the bit of position ''n'', a rule which exhibits the machine's (byte) endianness at least if {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 8,}} e.g. if used for indexing a sufficiently large bit array. Other numberings do occur in various documentations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1812">'''''Food &amp; Nutritional Products (Pty) Ltd v Neumann'''''&lt;ref&gt;1986 (3) SA 464 (W).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in South African law. An exception to a special plea, it was heard in the Witwatersrand Local Division by Schabort J on May 1, 1985, with judgment handed down on June 7. The excipient's attorneys were Moss-Morris, Mendelow, Braude. The respondent's attorney was Nathan BK Luen. PN Levenberg appeared for the excipient and SJ Nochumsohn for the respondent.

It is frequently the case that legislation provides that a party may "apply" or "make application" to court for relief of a particular type. While the court may then be approached on motion, despite the foreseeability of a dispute of fact, statutory provisions of this nature will not be interpreted as rendering application proceedings peremptory in every case; sometimes proceedings by way of action will be permitted instead.&lt;ref&gt;Theophilopoulos 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

''In casu'', the court found that the word "application," in section 424(1) of the Companies Act.&lt;ref&gt;Act 61 of 1973. The section in question provides for an "application" to court for an order declaring that a director, or any other person, is personally responsible for the debts of the company concerned, where the business of the company has been carried on recklessly or fraudulently.&lt;/ref&gt; was not intended to have the narrow meaning of proceedings only by way of motion. Proceedings under the section might therefore be by way of action as well.

'''''Ginsberg v. New York''''', 390 U.S. 629 (1968), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court ruled that material that is not obscene may nonetheless be harmful for children, and its marketing may be regulated.

==Background==
Under New York Law it was illegal to willfully sell to a minor under 17 any picture which depicts nudity, is harmful to minors and any magazine which taken as a whole is harmful to minors.
Sam Ginsberg and his wife operated Sam's Stationery and Luncheonette in [[Bellmore, Long Island]]. In it they sold magazines including those deemed to be pornographic. He was prosecuted from two informants who testified that he personally sold two 16-year-old boys the magazines containing pornographic images of women. He was tried in Nassau County District Court and found guilty. The court had found that the pictures were harmful to minors under the law.

The Conviction was upheld by the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court of New York and was denied an appeal to the New York Court of Appeals.

Ginsberg argued before the court that the State of New York did not have the power to classify two different sets of the population in regards to obscene material and that it was an unconstitutional deprivation of liberty. He cited ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'', ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' and ''[[Prince v. Massachusetts]]''. All where the court sided with the minors.

==Opinion of the Court==
Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the court. The court rejected Ginsberg’s argument that New York had deprived minors of their liberty. The court found that it was well within the state’s power to protect minors and that just because the material is not classified as obscene to adults it may still be regulated with minors.

==Dissent==
Justice Douglas wrote a dissent where he strongly objected to the majority’s decision. He found the First Amendment to be an absolute that harbored no exclusion for the obscenity that the rest of the court had found. While he admitted that the material that had been sold to minors could be harmful, Douglas was concerned that the ruling would set a precedent that could be perpetuated to "protect" other segments of society from anything the government might deem obscene. He finished by saying the definition of obscenity is impossible to determine because it is highly subjective and laments that the court is forced to sit as the nation's board of censors.

The '''Golden Gate''' of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] ({{lang-ru|Zolotye Vorota, Золотые ворота}}), constructed between 1158 and 1164, is the only (albeit partially) preserved ancient Russian [[city gate]]. A museum inside focuses on the history of the [[Mongol invasion of Russia]] in the 13th century.

Golden Gates existed in the holiest cities of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]: [[Jerusalem]], [[Constantinople]], and [[Kiev]]. On making Vladimir his capital, [[Andrew the Pious]] aspired to emulate these structures, commissioning a lofty tower over the city's main gate to be erected in [[limestone]] and lined with golden plaques. According to ancient Russian chronicles, the masons were invited from [[Friedrich Barbarossa]]. The main arch used to stand 15 meters tall. The structure was topped with a [[barbican]] church dedicated to the Deposition of the Virgin's Robe and symbolizing the [[Theotokos]]'s protection of Andrew's capital.

The gate survived the Mongol destruction of Vladimir in 1237. By the late 18th century, however, the structure had so deteriorated that [[Catherine the Great]] was afraid to pass through the arch for fear of its tumbling down. In 1779, she ordered detailed measurements and drawings of the monument to be executed. In 1795, after many discussions, the vaults and barbican church were demolished. Two flanking round towers were constructed in order to reinforce the structure, and artisans then reconstructed the barbican, following the drawings made in 1779.

A '''golden bull''' or '''chrysobull''' was a [[decree]] issued by [[Byzantine Emperor]]s and later by monarchs in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], most notably by the [[Holy Roman Emperors]]. The term was originally coined for the golden [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] (a ''[[Bulla (seal)|bulla]] aurea''), attached to the decree, but came to be applied to the entire decree. Such decrees were known as golden bulls in western Europe and ''chrysobullos logos'', or chrysobulls, in the Byzantine Empire (χρυσός, ''chrysos'', being [[Greek language|Greek]] for [[gold]]).

For nearly eight hundred years, they were issued unilaterally, without obligations on the part of the other party or parties. However, this eventually proved disadvantageous as the Byzantines sought to restrain the efforts of foreign powers to undermine the empire. During the 12th century, the Byzantines began to insert into golden bulls sworn statements of the obligations of their negotiating partners.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Notable golden bulls included:

* [[Byzantine–Venetian Treaty of 1082|The Golden Bull of 1082]], issued by [[Alexios I Komnenos]] to grant [[Venice]] merchants with free trading rights, exempt from tax, throughout the [[Byzantine Empire]] in return for their defense of the [[Adriatic Sea]] against the [[Normans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Roger|title=City of Fortune: How Venice Ruled the Seas|year=2012|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-1400068203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I Am Curious (Yellow)''''' ({{Lang-sv|'''Jag är nyfiken – en film i gult'''}}, meaning "I Am Curious: A Film in Yellow") is a 1967 Swedish [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Vilgot Sjöman]], starring Sjöman and [[Lena Nyman]]. It is a companion film to 1968's ''[[I Am Curious (Blue)]]''; the two were initially intended to be one {{frac|3|1|2}} hour film.&lt;ref&gt;Vilgot Sjöman, ''I Was Curious: Diary of the Making of a Film'' ([[Grove Press]], 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

Director [[Vilgot Sjöman]] plans to make a social film starring his lover [[Lena Nyman]], a young theater student who has a strong interest in social issues.

Nyman's character, also named Lena, lives with her father in a small apartment in [[Stockholm]] and is driven by a burning passion for [[social justice]] and a need to understand the world, people and relationships. Her little room is filled with books, papers, and boxes full of clippings on topics such as "religion" and "men", and files on each of the 23 men with whom she has had sex. The walls are covered with pictures of [[concentration camp]]s and a portrait of [[Francisco Franco]], reminders of the crimes being perpetrated against humanity. She walks around Stockholm and interviews people about social classes in society, conscientious objection, gender equality, and the morality of vacationing in Franco's Spain. She and her friends also picket embassies and travel agencies. Lena's relationship with her father, who briefly went to Spain to fight Franco, is problematic, and she is distressed by the fact that he returned from Spain for unknown reasons after only a short period.

Through her father Lena meets the slick Bill (Börje in the original Swedish), who works at a menswear shop and voted for the Rightist Party. They begin a love affair, but Lena soon finds out from her father that Bill has another woman, Marie, and a young daughter. Lena is furious that Bill has not been open with her, and goes to the country on a bicycle holiday. Alone in a cabin in the woods, she attempts an ascetic lifestyle, meditating, studying [[nonviolence]] and practicing [[yoga]]. Bill soon comes looking for her in his new car. She greets him with a shotgun, but they soon start to make love. Lena confronts Bill about Marie, and finds out about another of his lovers, Madeleine. They begin to fight and Bill leaves. Lena has strange dreams, in which she ties two teams of soccer players – she notes that they number 23 – to a tree, shoots Bill and cuts his penis off. She also dreams of being taunted by passing drivers as she cycles down a road, until finally [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] drives up. She apologizes to him for not being strong enough to practice nonviolence.

Lena returns home, destroys her room, and goes to the car showroom where Bill works to tell him she has [[scabies]]. They are treated at a clinic, and then go their separate ways. As the embedded story of Lena and Bill begins to resolve, the film crew and director Sjöman are featured more. The relationship between Lena the actress and Bill the actor has become intimate during the production of Vilgot's film, and Vilgot is jealous and clashes with Bill. The film concludes with Lena returning Vilgot's keys as he meets with another young female theater student.

===Censorship===
The film includes numerous and frank scenes of [[nudity]] and staged [[sexual intercourse]]. One particularly controversial scene features Lena kissing her lover's flaccid [[human penis|penis]]. In 1969, the film was banned in [[Massachusetts]] for being [[Pornography|pornographic]] and Boston police seized the film reels for ''I Am Curious (Yellow)'' from the Symphony Cinemas. After proceedings in the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] (''Karalexis v. Byrne'', 306 F. Supp. 1363 (D. Mass. 1969)), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] (''Byrne v. Karalexis'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/396/976/case.html 396 U.S. 976 (1969)] and [http://supreme.justia.com/us/401/216/case.html 401 U.S. 216 (1971)]), the Second Circuit found the film not to be obscene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node/31 I Am Curious / Jag är nyfiken | Film International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitebloom|first1=Kenny|title=The Curious Case of 'I am Curious'|url=http://bostonlocaltv.org/blog/2011/08/the-curious-case-of-i-am-curious/|website=Boston TV News Digital Library|accessdate=22 January 2015|date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film was very popular at the box office, earning an estimated $6.6 million in North American rentals.&lt;ref&gt;"Big Rental Films of 1969", ''Variety'', 7 January 1970, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the 12th most popular film in the US in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;"The World's Top Twenty Films". ''Sunday Times'' (London, England) 27 September 1970: 27. The Sunday Times Digital Archive. accessed 5 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One reason it did so well was that it became popular among film stars to be seen going to the film. News of Johnny Carson seeing the film legitimized going to see it despite any misgivings about possible pornographic content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blood|first=Kirk L.|year=2016|title=My 1st Wife Had a Borderline Personality Disorder|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn= 978-1-329-90421-7|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
====Contemporary====
Initial reception to Curious Yellow was divided. [[Vincent Canby]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' referred to it as a "Good, serious movie about a society in transition,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By VINCENT CANBYMARCH 11, 1969 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B06E0DC1039E63ABC4952DFB5668382679EDE |title=Screen: 'I Am Curious (Yellow)' From Sweden - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1969-03-11 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Norman Mailer]] said he felt "like a better man" after having seen it. Conversely, [[Rex Reed]] described the film as "about as good for you as drinking furniture polish" and [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' lambasted it as "a dog... a real dog" and "stupid and slow and uninteresting.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-am-curious-yellow-1969|title=I Am Curious (Yellow) Movie Review (1969) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Retrospective====
In recent years, Yellow has received some reappraisal, thanks in part to [[Gary Giddins]], who authored the 2003 essay accompanying the Criterion Collection DVD release, and a review by Nathan Southern on the [[All Movie Guide]] website. Southern assesses the picture as "a droll and sophisticated comedy about the emotional, political, social, and sexual liberation of a young woman... a real original that has suffered from public incomprehension since its release and is crying out for reassessment and rediscovery.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/i-am-curious-yellow-v24002/review|title=I Am Curious (Yellow) (1967) - Vilgot Sjöman - Review - AllMovie|website=AllMovie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2015,  "I Am Curious (Yellow)" received a 52% rating based on 25 reviews, 13 "fresh" and 12 "rotten" on the review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

The '''Interior Museum''' is a [[museum]] operated by the [[United States Department of the Interior]] and housed at the Department's headquarters at the [[Main Interior Building|Stewart Lee Udall Main Interior Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], on the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/interiormuseum/|title=Interior Museum|website=Doi.gov|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Interior Museum opened in the U.S. Department of the Interior's newly-constructed headquarters in the nation's capital on March 8, 1938, a museum was considered a novel element to include in a federal office building. However, the Secretary of the Interior at that time—[[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]] (1874-1952)—was a proponent of the arts and also strongly believed in the importance of having the American people understand the work of the Department. To this day, the Interior Museum's mission remains to actively educate and inspire employees and the public about the ongoing stewardship of the nation's public lands, natural resources, and cultural heritage. The Interior Museum's collection contains more than 8,000 objects of historical, cultural, and scientific importance relating directly to the activities of the Department. 

In addition to developing exhibitions and public programs, Interior Museum staff also conduct public tours highlighting the elements that made the Stewart Lee Udall Department of the Interior Building a "symbol of a new day" during the Great Depression. The headquarters building contains more [[New Deal]]-era murals than any other government building, featuring such artists as [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Maynard Dixon]], [[William Gropper]], [[Allan Houser]], [[Velino Herrera]], and [[Millard Sheets]], plus a series of photomurals by [[Ansel Adams]].

Admission is free, but valid photo identification must be presented to enter the building. Museum hours are Monday through Friday, 8:30AM to 4:30PM (closed federal holidays). Building tours are offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2PM; advance reservations are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/interiormuseum/Tours.cfm|title=Tours|website=Doi.gov|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Is This Tomorrow?''''' is a comic strip, created by Kelly Shane and Woody Compton, begun as a college newspaper feature in 1991 and revived as a webcomic in 2003.  The comic is experimental in form and though it includes recurring characters, the subject matter and style often varies from strip to strip.  The name was taken from the anti-Communist comic book ''Is This Tomorrow'' published in 1947 by the Catechetical Guild Educational Society of St. Paul, Minnesota.

== History ==

In its original incarnation, the strip appeared on a semi-regular basis from 1991 to 1992 in the ''[[Florida Flambeau]]'', a student-run newspaper affiliated with [[Florida State University]] and [[Florida A&amp;M]] in Tallahassee, FL.

The strip was revived as a webcomic on July 14, 2003 and ran weekly until June 7, 2004.  Occasional strips were posted in 2004 and 2005.
On September 4, 2006, the strip began a weekly series titled Aether Transmission, which is still ongoing.  Though still varying in subject matter, writing style and graphic presentation, these strips are uniform in size and employ reoccurring characters.

== 3-D and other special strips ==

''Is This Tomorrow?'' has done strips and features utilizing 3-D, including the first{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} [[Anaglyph image|anaglyphic 3-D]] webcomic, "First Anniversary Comic (in 3-D)" (also titled "Atheists From Outer Space"), on July 12, 2004.  The July 12, 2010 comic "Post-Modern Love in 1.5-D" utilizes anaglyphic 3-D glasses to allow two images to appear in the last panel, letting the reader choose between a happy or unhappy ending.  The strip "Hypno-Illusio-Vision" (August 2, 2010) uses an optical illusion as part of the story and design.

The comic's creators collaborated with musician Coconut Monkeyrocket on the December 21, 2009 strip "I.T.T. Breaks the Sound Barrier ," a comic utilizing sound loops.

== Reprints ==

The strip "Thomas Pynchon: Man of Mystery" was reprinted as an accompany graphic to an article in the 2009 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Universalis]]'', a French language encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Universalis, Universalia 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Texts from the strips "The Annotated Steve Ditko Story Part 1" and "Steve Ditko Part 2" were reprinted as a biography of [[Steve Ditko]] in ''The Thunder Agents Companion'' (TwoMorrows Publishing), edited by Jon B. Cooke.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Jon B., ''The Thunder Agents Companion''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Amster''' (July 18, 1908 – June 11, 1986) was an interior decorator in New York City in the 1960s who created the Amster Yard, a New York Historic Landmark.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=LAWSON|first1=CAROL|title=JAMES AMSTER, 77, DECORATOR, DEAD|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/obituaries/james-amster-77-decorator-dead.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Amster was born on July 18, 1908, in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], and grew up in Boston, in a house with a yard, probably the reason why he decided to restore the Amster Yard in Manhattan.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pool|first1=Mary Jane|last2=Seebohm|first2=Caroline|title=20th Century Decorating, Architecture &amp; Gardens: 80 Years of Ideas and Pleasure from House &amp; Garden|date=1980|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71cE0j1y8lEC|accessdate=31 July 2017|isbn=9780030475818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amster attended the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], where he studied sculpture and painting.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Amster Yard, New York City, NY 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The original entrance to Amster Yard]]

Amster was known for his community involvement on the [[Turtle Bay, Manhattan]], neighborhood, and for his traditional style as interior decorator.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

At first Amster worked for [[Bergdorf Goodman]], a luxury goods department store based on Fifth Avenue in New York City and opened and managed its decorating and antiques department.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Amster went solo in 1938, opening his design firm.  Among his clients: businesses, shipbuilders and hotels in both Central America and United States. He is the interior designer responsible for the redecoration of [[The Pierre]], a luxury hotel located at 2 East 61st Street, Manhattan.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

In 1957 Amster founded [[Turtle Bay, Manhattan#Turtle Bay Association|E. 49th Street Association]], later Turtle Bay Association. The first meetings of the association were held at Amster Yard.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanlon" /&gt;

Amster was also affiliated with: the Prescott Neighborhood House (chairman), the Prescott Nursery School (chairman) and the Friends of Peter Detmold Park Foundation (president).&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Peter Detmold (1923–1972)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/peter-detmold-park&lt;/ref&gt; was a friend of Amster from the Turtle Bay Association, who was killed in 1972; his murderer was never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Mary|title=Ex of Slain Preservationist Wants His Unsolved 1972 Murder Case Reopened|url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120223/murray-hill-gramercy/ex-of-slain-preservationist-wants-his-unsolved-1972-murder-case-reopened|date=February 23, 2012|work=[[DNAinfo.com]]|accessdate=31 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731234622/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120223/murray-hill-gramercy/ex-of-slain-preservationist-wants-his-unsolved-1972-murder-case-reopened|archivedate=31 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amster Yard==
[[File:Amster Yard 09.JPG|thumb|upright|Original Boston Stage Coach marker]]

In 1944 Amster restored what is now known as Amster Yard, designated in 1966 a [[List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 14th to 59th Streets|New York City Designated Landmark]], at 211 1/2 East 49th Street. The building was originally a 19th-century boarding house, a station of the [[Boston Post Road]] and a commercial yard, but when Amster bought it in 1944 it was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Landmarks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamonstein-Spielvogel|first1=Barbaralee|title=The Landmarks of New York, Fifth Edition: An Illustrated Record of the City's Historic Buildings|date=2011|publisher=SUNY Press|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8ym5NeiylkC&amp;pg=PA226|accessdate=31 July 2017|isbn=9781438437712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amster renovated the building, with the help of Ted Sandier (architect) and Harold Sterner (artist),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolkart|first1=Andrew|title=Guide to New York City Landmarks|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwYcSFtdE_AC&amp;pg=PA118|accessdate=31 July 2017|isbn=9780470289631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. Mission to the United Nations, 799 United Nations Plaza, New York, NY 10017: Environmental Impact Statement|date=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wjg3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR31|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating an inner yard connecting several apartments/studios which he rented to many key figures in the design field: [[Norman Norell]] (fashion designer), [[Billy Baldwin (decorator)|Billy Baldwin]] (interior designer), [[Isamu Noguchi]] (sculptor),&lt;ref name="AIA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Norval|last2=Willensky|first2=Elliot|last3=Leadon|first3=Fran|title=AIA Guide to New York City|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTJlkowOwA4C&amp;pg=PT808|accessdate=31 July 2017|isbn=9780199758647}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SwidPowell&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/29/garden/architects-show-how-to-set-a-grand-table.html&lt;/ref&gt; (firm).

One of the apartments was Amster's home, which he decorated with [[Biedermeier]] furniture; his 1946 Christmas tree, decorated with 15th and 16th century saints, a Christ child, and 18th century hand-blown glass balls was featured on a full page on Life Magazine on December 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=LIFE|date=9 December 1946|issue=Vol. 21, Num. 24|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mk0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA81|accessdate=31 July 2017|title=LIFE|author1=Inc|first1=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the party hosted by Amster to inaugurate the Yard, [[Elsie de Wolfe]], mentor to Amster, suggested that he put a mirror at one end of the Yard to give the impression that the Yard was bigger. Amster framed the mirror inside an arch. The mirror is still in place at the Yard today.&lt;ref name="Hanlon" /&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Amster Yard, New York City, NY.jpg|thumb|The entrance to James Amster's apartment]]

James Amster was in a long-lasting relationship with Robert K. Moyer.&lt;ref name="Hanlon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanlon|first1=Pamela|title=Manhattan's Turtle Bay: Story of a Midtown Neighborhood,|date=2008|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|page=vii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXdj8Uk1-XwC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=31 July 2017|isbn=9780738525235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the Amster-Moyer relationship, journalist and friend [[Mike Wallace]] described them in 1995 as "a wonderful old married couple" and "both people that [sic] I admired".&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaiser|first1=Charles|title=The Gay Metropolis 1940–1996|date=1997|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=0-395-65781-4|page=171|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HO7IKU79zgAC|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amster was also friends with [[Constance Spry]], British educator and florist, and [[Syrie Maugham]], leading British interior decorator of the 1920s and 1930s and wife to [[W. Somerset Maugham]].&lt;ref name="Shephard"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shephard|first1=Sue|title=The Surprising Life of Constance Spry|date=2010|publisher=Pan Macmillan|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8k2Lcm9dzYcC&amp;pg=PP102|accessdate=31 July 2017|isbn=9780330536103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amster died of [[leukemia]] on June 11, 1986. Moyer continued to live at Amster Yard until 1992, when he was the last tenant to move out. Amster Yard was acquired in 1999 and renovated by the [[Instituto Cervantes]], New York, and since 2002, the Instituto allows people to use the yard as a [[pocket park]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AIA" /&gt; However, when the Instituto acquired the property, much of it was destroyed. And, indeed, the premises had fallen into disrepair. According to Tina Kelley in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2002: "Most of its courtyard, trees and walkways have been dug up, right down to the schist..... Most of its buildings have been demolished."&lt;ref&gt;Tina Kelley, "A New York Landmark in Rubble: Preservationists Protest Demolition at Amster Yard." https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/21/nyregion/a-new-york-landmark-in-rubble-preservationists-protest-demolition-at-amster-yard.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even though the New York City [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]] stepped in after the damage was done, the Instituto through its site's developers, the Instituto Cervantes, promised to restore the Yard. However, a complete restoration is not as it was. Kelley in ''The Times'''s May 21, 2002, article reported: "But some people involved in the project regret that the final product will not include the actual older, protected buildings."&lt;ref&gt;Tina Kelley, "A New York Landmark in Rubble: Preservationists Protest Demolition at Amster Yard." https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/21/nyregion/a-new-york-landmark-in-rubble-preservationists-protest-demolition-at-amster-yard.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalku''' or '''Calcu''', in [[Mapuche mythology]], is a [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] or [[witch]] who works with [[black magic]] and negative powers or forces.  The essentially benevolent shamans are more often referred to as ''[[Machi (shaman)|machi]]'', to avoid confusion with the malevolent kalku. Its origins are in [[Mapuche]] tradition.

==Description==
The ''kalku'' is a semi-mythical character that has the power of working with ''[[wekufe]]'' "spirits or wicked creatures". An example of a ''wekufe'' is the [[Nguruvilu]]. The ''kalku'' also have as servants other beings such as the [[Anchimayen]], or the [[Chonchon]] (which is the magical manifestation of the more powerful ''kalku'').

A mapuche ''kalku'' is usually an inherited role, although it could be a ''machi'' that is interested in lucrative ends, or a "less powerful", frustrated ''machi'' who ignores the laws of the [[admapu]] (the rules of the Mapuches).

[[Image:Alfred Sisley 043.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|right|The 1859 Machine de Marly painted circa 1873 by [[Alfred Sisley]]]]

The '''Machine de Marly''', also known as the '''Marly Machine''' or the '''Machine of Marly''', was a large hydraulic system in [[Yvelines]], [[France]], built in 1684 to pump water from the river [[Seine]] and deliver it to the [[Palace of Versailles]].&lt;ref name=Thompson251&gt;Thompson 2006, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] needed a large water supply for his fountains at Versailles. Before the Marly Machine was built, the amount of water delivered to Versailles already exceeded that used by the city of [[Paris]], but this was insufficient, and fountain-rationing was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 2006, p. 251 and note on p. 351 ("Even though more ..."), citing Adams 1979, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically most of the water pumped by the Marly Machine ended up being used to develop a new garden at the [[Château de Marly]]. However, even if all the water pumped at Marly (an average of 3,200 cubic metres per day, or 845,351 gallons per day) had been supplied to Versailles, it still would not have been enough: the fountains running ''à l'ordinaire'' (that is, at half pressure) required at least four times as much.&lt;ref name=Thompson251/&gt;

The Machine de Marly, based on a prototype at [[Modave Castle]], consisted of fourteen gigantic water wheels, each roughly 11.5 meters or 38 feet in diameter,&lt;ref name=Pendery&gt;Pendery 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; that powered more than 250 pumps to bring water {{convert|177|yd|m|order=flip}} up a hillside from the [[Seine]] River to the [[aqueduc de Louveciennes|Louveciennes Aqueduct]]. Louis XIV had countless schemes and inventions that were supposed to bring water to his fountains. The Machine de Marly was by far his most extensive and costly plan. After three years of construction and a cost of approximately 5,500,000 [[French livre|livres]], the massive contraption, considered the most complex of the 17th century, was completed. "The chief engineer for the project was Arnold de Ville and the 'contractor' was [[Rennequin Sualem]] (after whom the quai by the machine is now named)."&lt;ref name=Pendery/&gt; Both men had experience in pumping water from coal mines in the region of [[Liège]] (in modern Belgium).&lt;ref&gt;Demoulin &amp; Kupper 2004, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine suffered from frequent breakdowns, required a permanent staff of sixty to maintain, and often required costly repairs, but worked 133 years.  Destroyed in 1817, it was replaced by a "machine temporaire" during 10 years and then a steam engine entered in service from 1827 to 1859.  From 1859 to 1963, the pumping at Marly was assumed by another hydraulic machine conceived by the engineer Xavier Dufrayer.&lt;ref&gt;Barbet 1907, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5nZZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA166 p. 166, note 3].&lt;/ref&gt; Dufrayer's machine was scrapped in 1968 and replaced by electromechanical pumps.

==Historical Context==
From the beginning, the construction of the château and the park of Versailles water supply had posed a problem. The site chosen by Louis XIV, a former hunting lodge of Louis XIII, was far removed from any river and high in elevation. The sovereign's will to have a park with more and more basins, water jets and fountains became a hallmark of his reign by the extension and improvement of a permanent water supply system with the construction of new pumps, aqueducts and reservoirs to collect ever more water, from a greater and greater distance.

The idea to bring water from the Seine to Versailles had always been under consideration. But more than just the distance - the river is located nearly 10&amp;nbsp;km from the château - there was the problem of the elevation to ascend, nearly 150 meters (490 feet). Since 1670, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], Louis XIV's Superintendent of the [[Bâtiments du Roi|King's Buildings]], had opposed several projects, including one proposed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques de Manse|fr}}, both for reasons of feasibility and that of cost.&lt;ref name =Bentz&gt;Bentz &amp; Soullard 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Arnold de Ville (1653-1722), a young and ambitious bourgeois of [[Huy]] in the Province of Liège, who had already built a pump in [[Saint-Maur, Oise|Saint-Maur]], succeeded in submitting to the king his project for pumping the waters of the River Seine to the [[Château of Val-Duchesse|Château of Val]] in the [[Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye|forest of Saint-Germain]], demonstrating that the same could be done to supply Versailles. This machine, a sort of small scale model of what the Machine of Marly could be, impressed the king,&lt;ref name ="S&amp;V"&gt;Testard-Vallant 2010, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; who then entrusted him with the development of a machine on the Seine to supply not only the gardens of Versailles, but also those of the Chateau of Marly then under construction.&lt;ref name =Bentz/&gt;

==Location==
The Machine de Marly site is located 7&amp;nbsp;km (4.4&amp;nbsp;mi) north of the Château de Versailles and 16.3&amp;nbsp;km (10.2&amp;nbsp;mi) west of the center of Paris, on the Seine in the [[Yvelines]] [[Departments of France|department]]. The river pumps and administration buildings are in the town of [[Bougival]]; relay pumps, machinery, the aqueduct and reservoirs are located in [[Louveciennes]]. One reservoir is in the town of [[Marly-le-Roi]].

Between [[Port-Marly]] and [[Bezons]], the Seine, along its length, was divided into two arms by a series of islands and earth berms linked together by timber/rock dikes to form two disconnected, parallel river beds over ten kilometers in length.  The hydraulic pumping machinery, propelling the river water to the top of the hill that borders the Seine, was constructed across from the left arm of the river, a little below the small village of La Chaussée, downstream of Bougival.
&lt;ref&gt;Barbet 1907, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5nZZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p. 95].&lt;/ref&gt; A dam at Bezons on the right arm creates a hydraulic head measuring 3.1 meters (10 feet 2 inches) high to power the wheels of the Machine de Marly.&lt;ref&gt;Barbet 1907, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5nZZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101].&lt;/ref&gt; The upper pumping relay station (demolished) was located next to the Château des Eaux (1700) and pumped water to the top of the Louveciennes aqueduct, which fed the Louveciennes and Marly reservoirs, near the site of the [[Château de Marly]] (demolished).

==Construction==
[[File:MarlyDidPl2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Engraving of the Machine de Marly from Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (plates vol. 5, 1767), showing side views of a typical paddle wheel, which powers river pumps from one side and remote pumps from the other]]

{{Quotation|It does not seem that one has ever completed a machine that has made as much noise in the world as that of Marly...|[[Bernard Forest de Bélidor|Bernard Bélidor]]&lt;ref&gt;Bélidor 1739, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65526489/f229.image.langEN p. 195]: "Il ne paroît pas que l'on ait jamais exécuté de machine qui ait fait autant de bruit dans le monde que celle de Marly..."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To design and build this machine, Arnold de Ville, who did not have the technical skills, appealed to two men from Liège, the master carpenter and mechanic [[Rennequin Sualem]] (1645-1708) and his brother Paulus. He had already worked with them on a pump at the [[Château de Modave]] and Rennequin Sualem was the designer of the pump at the [[Château of Val-Duchesse|Château  de Val]]. The entire project – channeling and dikes on the Seine, construction of the machine and the network of aqueducts and basins – would last for 6 years. The site chosen on the Seine was that of [[Bougival]] (at the location of the current locks of Bougival).

About 7 kilometers upstream, Colbert channeled a portion of the Seine by linking several islands with dikes from the island of Bezons and separating the river into two arms, a western arm for navigation and an eastern arm destined to supply the machine by creating a constriction and a drop&lt;ref name =Bentz/&gt; of about three meters&lt;ref name = "S&amp;V" /&gt; to power the 14 paddle wheels of the machine. The construction mobilized 1800 workers and required more than 100,000 tons of wood, 17,000 tons of iron and 800 tons of lead and as much cast iron.&lt;ref name = "S&amp;V"/&gt; The wood used in the construction of the platform and the wheels of the machine, and for the dikes between the islands and for the buildings came from the surrounding forests. The iron for rods came from the Nivernais and Champagne and most of the cast iron pipe was produced in Normandy.&lt;ref name =Bentz/&gt;

A large number of [[Walloons]] came to work on the project. They possessed a know-how acquired from their work on water evacuation from mines. Many defected as well because of the economic difficulties encountered then in [[Wallonia]], which had been ravaged by wars. Illiterate, the Sualem brothers were from a family of master carpenters from the mines of Liège. They were the only ones to have mastered the mechanism for remote power transmission, the [[flatrod system]] necessary for the proper functioning of the machine of Marly. The Walloon craftsmen went on to become the primary maintenance men essential for the enormous task of keeping the machine in working order.&lt;ref name =Bentz/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The work began in June 1681 with the canalization of the Seine. The construction of the machine began at the end of 1681. On June 14, 1682, a successful demonstration was held in the presence of Louis XIV.&lt;ref name =Bentz/&gt;  The water could be elevated to the top of the hillside. The machine was inaugurated June 13, 1684&lt;ref name = "S&amp;V"/&gt; by the king and his court. The [[aqueduc de Louveciennes]] was completed in 1685 and the entire project, three years later, in 1688.

The total cost of the project was 5.5 million [[livres tournois]] (over 100 million dollars 2015 &lt;ref&gt;Tiberghien 2002, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;). It included the construction of the machine itself (3,859,583 livres), buildings, aqueducts and water basins, the supply of materials, and the wages of the workers and artisans. (Rennequin Sualem was the best paid with 1800 pounds per year.).&lt;ref name =Bentz/&gt; After the end of the work and the successful demonstration, Rennequin Sualem was appointed First Engineer of the King by Louis XIV and knighted. To the king, who asked him how he had had the idea of this machine, Rennequin answered in [[Walloon language|Walloon]]: "Tot tuzant, Sire" ("By thinking hard, Sire").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belgiumtheplaceto.be/happy_famous_belgians_introduction.php?idcat=20&amp;idfamous=6.  "Rennequin Sualem"] of: "Famous Belgians"&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnold de Ville earned a great deal of money from the success of the machine and was able to rise into the aristocracy.&lt;ref name =Bentz/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:MarlyBirdsye3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Engraved view of the Machine de Marly, looking downriver]]

The engraving illustrated here describes the functioning of the machine as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
THE MACHINE OF MARLY is built on an arm of the Seine river. It consists of 14 wheels of 30 feet [11.9&amp;nbsp;m; 39 English feet] in diameter, the axles of which have two cranks, one which moves the pistons which push the water into the pipes and raise it up to the first reservoir; the other moves a system of crossarm levers which run the length of the mountain up to the highest reservoir. These crossarms power the pumps which are in the reservoirs and pump the water from the lower reservoir to the upper and from there to the top of the tower which is at the summit of the mountain, from where it runs over a large aqueduct which feeds different pipes to furnish all the waters of Versailles and Marly.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Pumping technology of the era of Louis XIV did not allow the delivery of water from the Seine to the top of the aqueduct of Louveciennes, an elevation differential of more than 150 meters (490 feet) in just one stage, so two intermediate pump relay stations were built, one at 48  meters (156 feet) and another at 99 meters (322 feet) above the river. Pumps in the relay locations were powered by two sets of oscillating timber and metal tie-rod linkages, driven by the river paddle wheels. A reservoir at each station buffered the water supply for each level of pumps.

==Remnants==
Some remnants of Dufrayer's machine are still visible today, but little remains of the original 17th-century masterpiece built by the Sualem brothers, de Ville and Louis XIV.

The overgrown walls of the mid-slope reservoir are visible on the hillside, just adjacent to the cobblestone path that runs straight up the incline. The paving stones on this 17th century service road are set with their top edges slightly exposed to allow better traction for the horses which hauled loads uphill.

Two administration buildings from the original Machine complex of 1684 still exist next to the Seine.&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=PA00087379 PA00087379] (in French), website of the French [[Monuments historiques]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The building which housed the steam-driven pumping machine from 1825 can still be seen next to the river as well.

An engraving of the [[Paris Observatory]] from the beginning of the eighteenth century shows the wooden "Marly tower" on the right, a dismantled part of the Machine de Marly (the temporary tower replaced by La tour du Levant at the beginning of the [[Aqueduc de Louveciennes]]), moved to the [[Paris Observatory]] by astronomer [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] for mounting long telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Barbet 1907, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5nZZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124 p. 124].&lt;/ref&gt;

Public notaries in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[jurisdiction]]s, such as [[New Zealand]] and [[Queensland, Australia]], are still appointed through the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, though in all other [[Australia]]n States and Territories they are appointed by the relevant [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==History==
Following the [[English Reformation]], the [[Ecclesiastical Licences Act 1533]], s.3 gave the Archbishop, or "hys commissarie", power to issue "suche licences dispensacions composicions faculties delegacies rescriptes instrumentes or wrytynges have byn accustomed to be had, at the [[See of Rome]]". This included the power to appoint notaries in the ecclesiastical courts and the office of ''commissarie'' developed into that of the '''Master of the Faculties'''.&lt;ref name="office"/&gt;

The '''Master''' was formerly the principal officer of the [[Court of Faculties]], one of the [[ecclesiastical court]]s, and also had the power, under the 1533 Act to:{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
*Create rights as to [[pew]]s, [[monuments]], and rights of [[burial]] places; or

'''Montagu House''' (sometimes spelled "Montague") was a late 17th-century mansion in [[Great Russell Street]] in the [[Bloomsbury]] district of [[London]], which became the first home of the [[British Museum]]. The first house on the site was destroyed by fire in 1686. The rebuilt house was sold to the British Museum in 1759, and demolished in the 1840s to make way for a larger building.

==Construction==
The house was actually built twice, both times for the same man, [[Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu]]. The late 17th century was Bloomsbury's most fashionable era, and Montagu purchased a site which is now in the heart of London but which then backed onto open fields (the [[Field of the Forty Footsteps|Long Fields]]).

===First house===
His first house was designed by the English architect and scientist [[Robert Hooke]], an architect of moderate ability whose style was influenced by French planning and Dutch detailing, and was built between 1675 and 1679. Admired by contemporaries, it had a central block and two service blocks flanking a large courtyard and featured murals by the Italian artist [[Antonio Verrio]]. The French painter [[Jacques Rousseau (painter)|Jacques Rousseau]] also contributed wall paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Rousseau, Jacques|volume=23|page=774}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1686, the house was destroyed by fire.

===Second house===
The house was rebuilt to the designs of an otherwise little known Frenchman called Pouget. This Montagu House was by some margin the grandest private residence constructed in London in the last two decades of the 17th century. The main façade was of seventeen bays, with a slightly projecting three bay centre and three bay ends, which abutted the service wings of the first mansion. The house was of two main storeys, plus basement and a prominent mansard roof with a dome over the centre. The planning was in the usual French form of the time, with [[state apartments]] leading from a central saloon. The interiors, decorated by French artists, were admired by [[Horace Walpole]] and were probably comparable to the surviving state apartments at [[Boughton House]] in [[Northamptonshire]], which were built for the same patron at the same time.

==History==
In the early 18th century, Bloomsbury began to decline gently from a fashionable aristocratic district to a more middle class enclave, and the 2nd Duke of Montagu abandoned his father's house to move to Whitehall. He built himself a more modest residence which was later replaced with an opulent mansion by his Victorian descendant, [[Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch]]: ''see [[Montagu House, Whitehall]].'' Montagu House in Bloomsbury was sold to the Trustees of the British Museum in 1759 and was the home of that institution until it was demolished in the 1840s to make way for larger premises.

==In popular culture==
In fiction, the House appears in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]'' as Ravenscar House with [[Daniel Waterhouse]] as the architect in place of Hooke.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

[[Image:Navestopicalbible.JPG|thumb|Nave's Topical Bible]]
'''Nave's Topical Bible''' is a book written by [[Orville Nave|Orville James Nave]] (1841–1917) and published by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson Publishers]]. Nave was a chaplain in the United States Army and referred to his work as "the result of fourteen years of delight and untiring study of the Word of God." &lt;ref name="christianity.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.christianity.com/Concordances/|title= Nave's Topical Bible|accessdate=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a topical [[concordance of the Bible]], and contains Biblical references to over 20,000 topics. Scripture is quoted over 100,000 times; the same Scripture citation may appear under several headings.

The topic headings are broad, covering many religious concepts, geographical regions, and names of Biblical figures. While [[theological]] concepts such as [[salvation]] and [[worship]] are included, a wide range of topics, such as Biblical references to [[rope]]s, are also included. This reflects the author's intention, as stated in the book's [[preface]], to "...note and classify everything found in the Scriptures".

The book took fourteen years to complete. Its original copyrights were 1896 and 1897. Until at least 1907 the book was published by the Topical Bible Publishing Company of Lincoln Nebraska. At least seven editions have been published, based on the [[King James Version]] and [[Revised Version]] of the Bible. Each verse of the Bible is indexed according to the topics it is classified under. Christian figures such as [[Billy Graham]] have endorsed the book.

[[File:Naked Pictures of Bea Arthur 0091.jpg|thumb|300px|New York City Museum School]]

The '''New York City Museum School''' ('''NYCMS''') is a public school for grades 9–12 in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]], [[New York City]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome - N.Y.C. Museum School - M414 - New York City Department of Education|last=Felix|first=Amedeo|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/02/M414/default.htm|work=NYC Department of Education site|publisher=NYC Department of Education|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NYC Museum School offers students access to primary resources in the sciences, history, literature and the arts. The unique use of museum collections enables students to examine evidence, illustrate ideas, provoke questions, and suggest new ways of presenting knowledge. Classroom instruction is reinforced with museum-based projects that are geared to state and local curricular mandates. Students explore, apply and create knowledge in the context of individual and group learning.

The school's curriculum requires weekly visits to museums all over New York City, where an NYCMS teacher conducts class in conjunction with Museum staff. These visits supplement conventional classes held inside the school.

NYCMS provides education to a heterogeneous group of students from a diverse community. The faculty includes licensed teachers and museum professionals who collaborate to design the curriculum.

The school partners with museums such as the [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[South Street Seaport Museum]] and [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]

{{about|the English publication|the Irish publication|Old Moore's Almanac}}
[[File:OldMooresAlmanac1862.jpg|thumb|An 1862 issue of ''Old Moore's Almanac''.]]
'''''Old Moore’s Almanack''''' is an [[astrological almanac]] which has been published in Britain since 1697.

It was written and published by [[Francis Moore (astrologer)|Francis Moore]], a self-taught physician and astrologer who served at the court of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

The first edition in 1697 contained weather forecasts. In 1700 Moore published '''''Vox Stellarum''''', The Voice of the Stars, containing astrological observations; this was also known as ''Old Moore’s Almanack''. It was a bestseller throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, selling as many as 107,000 copies in 1768.

The '''phablet''' ({{IPAc-en|'|f|æ|b|l|ᵻ|t}}) is a class of [[mobile devices]] combining or straddling the size format of [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablet]]s. The word itself is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''phone'' and ''tablet''.&lt;ref name=pcmag /&gt; 

Phablets feature large displays that complement screen-intensive activity such as [[mobile web|mobile web browsing]] and [[multimedia]] viewing. They may also include software optimized for an integral self-storing [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]] to facilitate sketching, note-taking and annotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should You Buy a Phablet?|url=http://techland.time.com/2013/11/04/should-you-buy-a-phablet/|website=Time|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phablets were originally designed for the Asian market where consumers could not afford both a smartphone and tablet as in North America; phones for that market are known for having "budget-specs-big-battery" with large low resolution screens and midrange processors, although other phablets have flagship specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414425,00.asp|title=Weighing the Phablet's Potential|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-g5-plus|title=Moto G5 Plus review: The new standard for budget phones|date=27 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, phablets in North America have also become successful for several reasons; Android 4.0 and subsequent releases of Android were suited to large as well as small screen sizes, while older consumers preferred larger screen sizes on smartphones due to deteriorating eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techpinions.com/would-i-buy-a-phablet/13789|title=Would I Buy A Phablet?|website=Tech.pinions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Samsung]]'s [[Samsung Galaxy Note (original)|Galaxy Note]] (2011) is largely credited with popularizing the phablet when launched in 2011,&lt;ref name="credited"&gt;{{Citation| url = http://allthingsd.com/20120109/samsung-shows-off-7-7-inch-lte-tablet-and-more-of-that-phablet/| title = Samsung Shows Off 7.7-Inch LTE Tablet and More of That 'Phablet'| work =AllThingsD|author=Goode, Lauren Goode|date=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples of earlier devices with similar form factors date to 1993.&lt;ref name="pcmag"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/294004/enter-the-phablet-a-history-of-phone-tablet-hybrids| title = Enter the Phablet: A History of Phone-Tablet Hybrids|newspaper=[[PC Magazine]]|author=Segan, Sasha|date=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timetech"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://techland.time.com/2013/04/02/phablets-are-a-niche-not-a-fad/| title = Phablets Are a Niche, Not a Fad|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|last=Newman |first=Jared |date=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="avoid"&gt;{{Citation| url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/02/28/why-get-a-tablet-when-you-can-have-a-phablet/| title = Why Get A Tablet When You Can Have A Phablet?|newspaper=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|author=Olsen, Parmy|date=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/04/24/phablets-and-fonepads-the-new-tech-lexicon/?KEYWORDS=phablet| title = 'Phablets' and Fonepads the New Tech Lexicon|newspaper =[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of phablets grew dramatically in 2012, as a [[Samsung Galaxy Note II|successor to the original Galaxy Note]], along with the falling costs and increasing power efficiency of smartphone displays, began to fuel competition in the market from other smartphone manufacturers, including [[Lenovo]], [[LG Electronics|LG]], [[HTC]], [[Huawei]], [[Micromax Informatics|Micromax]], and [[Sony Mobile|Sony]]; [[IHS Inc.|IHS]], [[Samsung]] reported that 25.6 million phablets were sold in 2012 alone. Due to the market's growth, [[Reuters]] called 2013 the "Year of the Phablet".&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{Citation| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/07/us-phablets-idUSBRE9050CS20130107| title = Handset makers scurry to join Year of the Phablet| publisher = Reuters|author1=Wagstaff, Jeremy |author2=Yee, Lee Chyen |date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, noting that phablets had overtaken laptops and desktops in global sales, ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "phablets could become the dominant computing device of the future{{snd}}the most popular kind of phone on the market, and perhaps the only computer many of us need".&lt;ref name="nytdominant"&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Size comparison between Lenovo Phab and Huawei Mate 20 X.png|thumb|Although Huawei Mate 20 X has a longer diagonal screen size (7.21 inches) than Lenovo Phab (6.98 inches), It has a more compact body because of thinner bezels and different display aspect ratio.]]
The definition of a phablet has changed in recent years due to the proliferation of larger displays on mainstream smartphones, and smartphones designed with thin bezels and/or curved screens to make them more compact than other devices with similar screen sizes. Thus, a device with a "phablet-sized" screen may not necessarily be considered one.&lt;ref name="phonearena-s7edgenotphablet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-phabletpytha" /&gt;

Current phablets typically have a [[Display size|diagonal]] display measurement between {{convert|5.1|inch|mm}}&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE. THIS IS EXPLICITLY MENTIONED IN SOURCES--&gt; and {{convert|7|inch|mm}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best phablets of 2016: the 20 best big screen phones you can buy|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/mobile-phone/best-phablets-of-2016-uk-3494881/|website=TechAdvisor|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=8 Best Phablets You Can Buy in 2017|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/best-phablets-2015_round-up|website=Trusted Reviews|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-phabletpytha" /&gt;  assuming a [[16:9]] [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]].&lt;ref name="verge-phabletpytha" /&gt; In comparison, most flagship smartphones released in 2016 have a screen size of around {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}, with larger versions of mainstream flagships (such as [[iPhone 7 Plus]], [[Pixel XL]], and [[Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge]]) using {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} displays.&lt;ref name="verge-phabletpytha"/&gt; ''PhoneArena'' argued that the S7 Edge was not a phablet, as it has a narrow and compact build with a physical footprint more in line with the smaller-screened [[Nexus 5X]], due primarily to its use of a display with curved edges.&lt;ref name="phonearena-s7edgenotphablet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't call it a phablet: the 5.5" Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is narrower than many 5.2" devices|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/Dont-call-it-a-phablet-the-5.5-Samsung-Galaxy-S7-Edge-is-narrower-than-many-5.2-devices_id79482|website=PhoneArena|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, LG, Samsung, and Apple each began to produce flagship smartphones ([[LG G6]], [[Samsung Galaxy S8]], and [[iPhone X]]) with displays taller than the conventional 16:9 aspect ratio used by the majority of devices, and diagonal screen sizes in line with those of phablets. However, in these cases, the sizes of the two devices are more compact than 16:9 aspect ratio devices with equivalent diagonal screen sizes.&lt;ref name="verge-phabletpytha"&gt;{{cite web|title=We’re gonna need Pythagoras’ help to compare screen sizes in 2017|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/30/15120824/screen-aspect-ratio-mathematics-galaxy-s8-lg-g6|website=The Verge|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-s8aspectratio"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Samsung Galaxy S8 will change the way we think about display sizes|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/30/15121526/samsung-galaxy-s8-vs-google-pixel-iphone-7-screen-size-comparison|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, some models of [[Huawei]] like [[Huawei Mate 20|Mate 20 X]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_20_x-9369.php|title=Huawei Mate 20 X - Full phone specifications|website=www.gsmarena.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Honor 8X Max&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_honor_8x_max-9306.php|title=Huawei Honor 8X Max - Full phone specifications|website=www.gsmarena.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; have surpassed the barrier of 7 inches of diagonal screen size.

The [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based [[Dell Streak]] included a 5-inch (130&amp;nbsp;mm), 800×480 display and a widescreen-optimized interface. Reviewers encountered issues with its outdated operating system, Android 1.6 (which was not yet optimized for such a large screen size), and the device was commercially unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=cw-rise&gt;{{cite news|last=Elgan|first=Mike|title=Rise of the 'phablet'|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9224363/Rise_of_the_phablet_|newspaper=Computerworld|date=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will 2013 be the year of the phablet as phone screens grow bigger?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/08/2013-year-phablet|publisher=Reuters | location=London|date=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Dell Streak: A Smartphone With a Tablet Heart| url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/201488/Promising_Dell_Streak_Feels_Both_Innovative_and_Dated.html| newspaper=[[PC World]]| accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galaxy Note was a commercial success; Samsung announced in December 2011 that the Galaxy Note had sold 1 million units in two months. In February 2012, Samsung debuted a Note version with [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/12/29/1-million-galaxy-notes-shipped-worldwide-us-fans-throw-money-at/|title=1 million Galaxy Notes shipped worldwide, US fans throw money at their screens|author=Mat Smith|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2012, the Note had sold 10 million units worldwide.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung: 10M Galaxy Notes sold in nine months|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57493718-94/samsung-10m-galaxy-notes-sold-in-nine-months/|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012, Samsung introduced the [[Galaxy Note II]], featuring a 1.6&amp;nbsp;GHz quad-core processor, a {{convert|5.55|in|mm}} screen and the ability to run two applications at once via a split-screen view.

In late-2012 and early 2013, companies began to release smartphones with 5 inch screens at [[1080p]] resolution, such as the [[HTC Droid DNA]] and [[Samsung Galaxy S4]]. Despite the screen size approaching those of phablets, HTC's design director Jonah Becker said that the Droid DNA was not a phablet.&lt;ref name=gsmarena-review&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s4-review-914.php |title=Samsung Galaxy S4 review: Supernova |date=28 March 2013 |work= |publisher=GSMArena |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thingsd-droiddna&gt;{{cite web|title=The Droid DNA: It’s Not a Phablet, It’s a Smartphone|url=http://allthingsd.com/20121113/meet-the-ultimate-droid-droid-dna/|website=AllThingsD|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HTC would release a proper phablet, the [[HTC One Max]]{{snd}}a smartphone with a {{convert|5.9|in|mm|abbr=on}} screen and a design based on its popular [[HTC One (2013)|HTC One]] model, in October 2013.&lt;ref name=verge-maxofficial&gt;{{cite web|title=HTC One max official with 5.9-inch display and fingerprint scanner|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/14/4836438/htc-one-max-official-with-5-9-inch-display-and-fingerprint-scanner|work=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of Android phablets with screens larger than 6 inches began appearing in 2013; with the Chinese company [[Huawei]] unveiling its {{convert|6.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[Huawei Ascend Mate|Ascend Mate]] at [[Consumer Electronics Show]], and Samsung introducing the [[Samsung Galaxy Mega|Galaxy Mega]], a phablet with a {{convert|6.3|in|mm|abbr=on}} variant, which has midrange specs and lacks a stylus compared to the flagship Galaxy Note series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_mega_63-review-939p11.php|title=Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 review: Walking tall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat-phablets&gt;{{cite web|title=Shipments of 'phablets,' or large smartphones, to double in 2013|archivedate=2013-04-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416094700/http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-phablet-shipments-double-2013-20130116,0,6706144.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-phablet-shipments-double-2013-20130116,0,6706144.story|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aaron Souppouris |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/11/4212122/samsung-galaxy-mega-58-63-pictures-specs-release-date |title=Samsung announces Galaxy Mega 5.8 and 6.3, coming to Europe in May |publisher=The Verge |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2013-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sony Mobile]] also entered the phablet market with its {{convert|6.4|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[Sony Xperia Z Ultra|Xperia Z Ultra]].&lt;ref name=techradar-zultra&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony Xperia Z Ultra review: Is it a tablet?

As a variation of the concept, [[Asus]] and Samsung also released otherwise small-sized tablets, the [[Asus FonePad|FonePad]], [[Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0|Galaxy Note 8.0]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0|Galaxy Tab 3 8.0]], with cellular connectivity and the ability to place voice calls.&lt;ref name=engadget-fonepad&gt;{{cite web|title=ASUS FonePad official: 7-inch tablet with phone functionality, priced at $249 (hands-on)|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/25/asus-fonepad-announced/|work=Engadget|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, [[Nokia]] also introduced [[Windows Phone 8]] phablets, such as the 6-inch [[Nokia Lumia 1520|Lumia 1520]].&lt;ref name=Engadget&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, Mat |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/10/22/nokia-lumia-1520/ |title=Nokia Lumia 1520: Windows Phone with 6-inch 1080p display and 20MP camera for $750 |work=Engadget |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022072912/http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/22/nokia-lumia-1520/ |archivedate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] released its first phablet, the {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}-inch [[iPhone 6 Plus]]; the introduction of the new model reversed a previous policy under late Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] not to produce a mid-sized device larger than the [[iPhone]] or smaller than the [[iPad]], which were 3.5 inches and 9.7 inches, respectively, at the time of his death. While Apple's iPad heavily dominated the tablet market, the void in their lineup left an opening for intermediate-sized, with other handset manufacturers already jumping on the trend of producing larger screen sizes to suit all niches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qz.com/41749/apple-refuses-to-make-the-one-mobile-device-taking-over-the-world-but-not-for-long/][https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414425,00.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytdominant"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">'''Pricena'''(Arabic: برايسنا) is a [[shopping comparison engine]] serving the Middle East. The site was initially launched in 2013 in the [[United Arab Emirates]], then expanded to [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Qatar]], as well as [[Nigeria]], [[South Africa]], and [[India]].
The origin of the name Pricena (pronounced ''Price-na'') comes from a contraction of the words "Price" and "na", the latter meaning "our" in Arabic, thus forming "Our Price". The site allows online shoppers to compare prices of more than one million products from over 200 stores across the Middle East.

== History ==
Below are the major milestones for Pricena:

* July 2013: Pricena was launched as a website in July 2013 in Dubai.
* January 2014: Pricena launches its website in Saudi Arabia with Arabic support.&lt;ref name="saudi" /&gt;
* July 2014: Pricena launches in Egypt
* May 2015: Pricena launches its iOS app
* August 2015: Pricena launches its Android app
* December 2015: Pricena launches in Kuwait.&lt;ref name="kuwait" /&gt;

== Online Startup of the Year 2015 Award ==
In November 2015, Pricena was recognized as the Online Startup of the Year for 2015 by Du Enterprise Agility Awards.&lt;ref name="award" /&gt; The award’s criteria were based on a ''startup’s purpose to solve a specific and clear regional problem, its ability to attract a sizable audience and its potential to further grow in the region and beyond''.

'''Return on modeling effort''' ('''ROME''') is the benefit resulting from a (supplementary) effort to improve a model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://erikproper.blogspot.fr/2009/02/models-that-matter-return-on-modelling.html|title=Models that matter; Return on Modelling Effort|website=erikproper.blogspot.fr|last=Proper|first=Erik|year=2009|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
In engineering, [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] always serves a particular goal. For example, the lightning protection of aircraft can be modeled as an electrical circuit, in order to predict whether the protection will still work in 30 years, given the ageing of its electrical components. More and more effort can be put in making this model predict reality perfectly. However, this perfection comes at a price: researchers invest time and money in improving the model. As a [[Return on investment]] (ROI), the ROME is a metric for the use of further modeling. It may therefore serve as a 'stopping criterion'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Typically, researchers will pull towards continuing modeling, while management will pull towards stopping modeling. Being explicit about the cost and benefits of continued modeling may help to make informed decisions that are understood by both sides.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Domains ==
ROME is a [[:Category:metrics|metric]], which can be evaluated wherever modeling is performed with a business goal. Examples include:
* Modeling a marketing mix to statistically correlate a number of inputs (or independent variables) - such as a marketing campaign - to outcomes (or dependent variables) - such as sales or profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/marketingmixmodeling/|title=Marketing Mix Modeling|last=Thomas|first=Jerry W.|year=2006|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alexander III Rota.png|thumb|''Rota'' of [[Pope Alexander III]], AD&amp;nbsp;1175]]
The '''''rota''''' is one of the symbols used by the [[Pope]] to authenticate documents such as [[papal bull]]s. It is a cross inscribed in two concentric circles. [[Pope Leo IX]] was the first pope to use it.

The four inner quadrants contain: "[[Saint Peter|''Petrus'']]", "[[Paul of Tarsus|''Paulus'']]", the Pope's name, and the Pope's ordinal number. The Pope's [[autograph]] or motto is sometimes inscribed between the concentric circles.

A ''rota'' was also used by monarchs for the authentication of documents and [[diploma|diplomas]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, it was used by [[William I of Sicily]] and [[William II of Sicily]]: Antonia Gransden, ''Legends, Traditions, and History in Medieval England'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1992, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4884">The '''Round-Robin Letter''' is the name of an incident in the [[United States Army]] that occurred between July 28 and August 3, 1898, during the [[Spanish–American War]]. After disease incapacitated thousands of Army soldiers in the wake of the [[Siege of Santiago]], high-ranking officers of [[Fifth Army Corps (Spanish-American War)|Fifth Army Corps]] drafted a [[Round-robin (document)|round-robin letter]] demanding that the unit be sent back to the United States. Public release of the letter publicly embarrassed the U.S. government.

==About the incident==
By July 28, 1898, [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]] were [[pandemic]] among U.S. Army troops [[garrison]]ed near [[Santiago de Cuba]] on the island of [[Cuba]]. Fifth Corps, to which the [[Rough Riders]] was attached, had 4,270 men seriously ill (and dying), and corps commanders feared the unit could be wiped out if it stayed in Cuba.&lt;ref name="Wintermute558"&gt;Wintermute, p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[William McKinley|McKinley administration]], however, planned to keep the corps in Cuba until peace negotiations with Spain concluded. Public opinion was also against bringing home an army infected with yellow fever.&lt;ref name="Golay104"&gt;Golay, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several senior officers met with [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[William Rufus Shafter|William R. Shafter]], commander of Fifth Corps, and unanimously asked that the corps be withdrawn to the United States.&lt;ref name="Golay104" /&gt; It is unclear whether Shafter agreed and asked for this in writing, or whether Shafter disagreed and the corps commanders decided to put their request in writing. Colonel [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (commander of the First Volunteer US Cavalry Rough Riders), the only non-general officer of the group, was asked by the rest of the group to draft a round-robin letter outlining the problems with living conditions and disease to send to Army Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The letter would also be deliberately leaked to the press.&lt;ref name="Wintermute558" /&gt;

As a volunteer, Roosevelt's career would not be at stake in the way a regular army officer's would be by the communication.&lt;ref name="Golay105" /&gt; (Some sources say there is doubt that Roosevelt was the author,&lt;ref name="RoundRobin584" /&gt; while others say that Roosevelt was only the author of the abridged letter.&lt;ref name="Golay105"&gt;Golay, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;) Nine generals and Roosevelt signed the letter.&lt;ref name="RoundRobin584" /&gt; An abridged version was given to Shafter to present to the [[United States Secretary of War]].&lt;ref name="Wintermute558" /&gt; Shafter declined to do so, but did communicate with his superiors about what was happening.&lt;ref name="RoundRobin584"&gt;"Round Robin", in ''Historical Dictionary of the Spanish American War'', p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter was deliberately leaked to [[Associated Press]] correspondents at corps headquarters, who cabled it to the U.S., where it was published nationwide. Publication of the round-robin letter turned public opinion against the [[United States Department of War|War Department]].&lt;ref name="RoundRobin584" /&gt;

The McKinley administration was outraged by the leaking of the round-robin letter, but quickly realized that the public would blame the government. The administration acted swiftly to try to defuse the situation. On July 28, Secretary of War [[Russell A. Alger]] [[Telegraphy|cabled]] Shafter and ordered Fifth Corps home to [[Theodore Roosevelt County Park|Camp Wikoff]] on [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], for [[quarantine]] and [[Military discharge|mustering out]]. On August 3, the day before the letter appeared in the press, Alger ordered construction of barracks at Camp Wikoff to begin and for [[United States Navy]] ships to head to Cuba to retrieve Fifth Corps. The first units departed on August 7.&lt;ref name="Wintermute558" /&gt; Alger claimed that the round-robin letter did not accelerate administration plans to repatriate the corps. This appears disingenuous, however, as Alger had long asserted that naval ships were unavailable to bring the troops home.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 283, fn. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreliable sources|date=March 2016}}
'''Sea witches''' are traditional folklore characters usually portrayed as women with a magical bond or power regarding the sea, the weather, or other aspects of seafaring life. Sea witches have been featured in European [[folklore]] for centuries. 
Also referred to as 'Sea Hags', they are malevolent magical beings known for tempting mermaids to give up their immortality for the Love of a human. She collects their immortal essence for barter with powerful demons. She possesses a vast array of powerful magic, drawn from the brine of the sea.

==Mythology==

Traditionally, sea witches were [[Witchcraft|witches]] who appeared among [[sailor]]s or others involved in the [[shipping|seafaring trade]]. A sea witch may be presented as a magical or [[fairy]] creature such as a [[mermaid]] or [[selkie]], or as an ordinary human who uses magic to influence the sea. Their powers ranged from control over the winds and weather or the ability to influence the catches of fisherman, to complete power over the sea, the [[tides]], and the moon. Offending a sea witch by such means as refusing to pay her for her services, insulting her looks, or refusing to acknowledge her powers could end in disaster, as the sea witch might choose to destroy an entire ship. 

In addition to their powers over water, sea witches were said to control the wind and weather. A common feature of many [[Folklore|tale]]s was a rope tied into three [[knot]]s, which witches often sold to sailors to aid them on a voyage. Pulling the first knot could yield a gentle, southeasterly wind, while pulling two could generate a strong northerly wind, but the third knot would unleash a hurricane. In some versions of sea witch lore, the witch had the power to call up treasures lost in shipwrecks. In some stories a grieving widow begs the sea witch to bring to shore the body of a drowned husband, child, or sweetheart, so that it could be given a proper burial; in some versions this requires casting a coin or a ring into the sea as the witch's payment.

==Spiritual and religious==

A sea witch may refer to a Practitioner of a Pagan or Wicca group that often uses water when casting spells. (The term spell in this sense would be the equivalent of a prayer.) Within the Occult spectrum, the term Sea Witch and Water Witch may be used interchangeably, though a Water Witch is often applied to one that dowses for water. In 1997, Llewwllyn published a book written by Scott Cunningham named Earth Power, that gave information on natural magic(k)including water magic(k). The author refers to water magic(k) as a sub section of elemental magic(k) given water is an element found in Pagan and Wiccan practices. &lt;ref&gt;Scott Cunningham Earth Power {{ISBN|0-87542-121-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While Cunningham divides rain, fog and storm magic(k) into the subheading of Natural magic(k) in his book on pg 121, given they are associated to water, some may believe the acts pertain to water magic(k) and Sea Witches.

==In popular culture==
Along with their inclusion in older stories, sea witches have been included in contemporary stories as well.

* The [[nymph]] [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] is portrayed in ''[[Odyssey|The Odyssey]]'' with some powers of a sea witch: she is able to lure Odysseus' ship to her island while simultaneously causing the seas to repel all other ships that would rescue him, and she uses her powers to keep the weather around her island beautiful so that Odysseus will be seduced into remaining there.
* The witch [[Sycorax]] in Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'' is often interpreted to be a sea witch.
* Created in 1929, the [[Sea Hag]] is a pirate and the "last witch on Earth" in the [[Popeye]] comics and cartoons.
* [[Ursula (Disney)|Ursula]], the main [[antagonist]] in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's]] ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989) is a sea witch who is a [[mythological hybrid]], a half-human, half-octopus creature.&lt;ref name="Ursula"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvacres.com/horror_witches_ursula.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204235821/http://www.tvacres.com/horror_witches_ursula.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-04|title=Ursula the Sea Witch|accessdate=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antagonist of the sequel ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'', is Ursula's younger sister Morgana, who's also a sea witch. In the live-action movie ''[[Descendants 2]]'', Ursula's daughter Uma is also a sea witch.
* The character of [[Tia Dalma]] in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' presents herself as a mortal witch with some power over the sea, but is later revealed to be a sea goddess named Calypso.
* [[The Feldons]] 2012 album ''Goody Hallett and Other Stories'' is based on the legend of Goody Hallett, a sea witch who in the mid-1700s reputedly sold her soul to the devil and lured sailors to their deaths on the rocks.
* The Sea Witch is a hero unit featured in the video game ''[[Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne]]''. The Sea Witches are the foremost of the [[Nāga|Naga]] (night elves mutated into aquatic creatures by the Old Gods). The most prominent of them is Lady Vashj, the handmaiden of the infamous Queen Azshara and an ally of [[Illidan Stormrage]].
* [[Countess Palatine Ingrid Von Marburg]] in ''[[Salem (TV series)|Salem]]'' is a Water Witch, able to travel spectrally in her hag form via bathtubs and wells. Her presence can also be detected by a water charm spell.

The '''Vermont House''' is an exhibit building at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]], [[United States]]. It features rotating exhibits, which change yearly.

==History==
Asa R. Slocumb built '''Vermont House''' in the 1790s shortly after moving to [[Shelburne, Vermont]]. His descendants continued to live there until 1929 when they abandoned the house. According to legend, Slocumb’s first home was a log cabin which probably resembled the Museum’s [[Settlers House]]. Over time he constructed the wood frame and [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]] exterior that would become Vermont House’s original façade around and over the log cabin. After completing the new exterior, he dismantled the cabin and carried the logs away.

==Relocation==
When the [[Shelburne Museum]] acquired '''Vermont House''' in 1950, the building’s clapboard siding and interior walls had deteriorated beyond repair. While preserving its basic structure, the Museum built a new façade with stone from a Shelburne Falls [[gristmill]], randomly laying the stones using a technique known as scatter-stone, and reconstructed the interior with salvaged feather-edged boards from [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Connecticut]] houses. Although the museum preserved the structure’s four original fireplaces, it changed the floor plan so that it would include a study and a larger kitchen.

A '''sprachbund''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃpʁaːxbʊnt|lang}}, "federation of languages") – also known as a '''linguistic area''', '''area of linguistic convergence''', '''diffusion area''' or '''language crossroads''' – is a group of [[language]]s that have common features resulting from geographical proximity and [[language contact]]. They may be [[genetic relatedness of languages|genetically unrelated]], or only distantly related. Where genetic affiliations are unclear, the sprachbund characteristics might give a false appearance of relatedness. [[Areal feature]]s are common features of a group of languages in a sprachbund.

==History==
In a 1904 paper, [[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay]] emphasised the need to distinguish between language similarities arising from a genetic relationship (''rodstvo'') and those arising from [[language convergence|convergence]] due to language contact (''srodstvo'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] introduced the Russian term ''языковой союз'' (''yazykovoy soyuz''; "language union") in a 1923 article.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In a paper presented to the first [[International Congress of Linguists]] in 1928, he used a German [[calque]]  of this term, ''Sprachbund'', defining it as a group of languages with similarities in [[syntax]], morphological structure, cultural vocabulary and sound systems, but without systematic sound correspondences, shared basic morphology or shared basic vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In contrast, a [[sprachraum]] (from German, "language area"), also known as a [[dialect continuum]], describes a group of genetically related [[dialect]]s spoken across a geographical area, differing in their genetic relationship only slightly between areas that are geographically close, and gradually decreasing in [[mutual intelligibility]] as distances increase.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Examples==
===The Balkans===
{{Main|Balkan sprachbund}}
The idea of areal convergence is commonly attributed to [[Jernej Kopitar]]'s description in 1830 of [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as giving the impression of "''nur eine Sprachform ... mit dreierlei Sprachmaterie''",&lt;ref&gt;Jernej K. Kopitar, “Albanische, walachische und bulgarische Sprache”, ''Wiener Jahrbücher der Literatur'' 46 (1830): 59–106.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been rendered by [[Victor Friedman]] as "one grammar with the three lexicons".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
| contribution = One Grammar, Three Lexicons: Ideological Overtones and Underpinnings in the Balkan Sprachbund
| first = Victor A. | last = Friedman
| title = Papers from the 33rd Regional Meeting of the Chicago Linguistic Society
| publisher = Chicago Linguistic Society | year = 1997
| url = http://humstatic.uchicago.edu/slavic/archived/papers/Friedman-LgIdeologyCLS33.pdf
| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman (2000)"&gt;{{citation

| journal = Mediterranean Language Review | volume = 12 | year = 2000 | pages = 1–15
| url = http://humstatic.uchicago.edu/slavic/archived/papers/Friedman-170yrsbalkanling.pdf
| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Balkan sprachbund]] comprises Albanian, Romanian, the [[South Slavic languages]] of the southern Balkans (Bulgarian, [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and to a lesser degree [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]), [[Greek language|Greek]], Balkan [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Romani language|Romani]]. All but one of these are [[Indo-European languages]] but from very divergent branches, and Turkish is a [[Turkic language]]. Yet they have exhibited several signs of grammatical convergence, such as avoidance of the [[infinitive]], [[future tense]] formation, and others. The same features are not found in other languages that are otherwise closely related, such as the other Romance languages in relation to Romanian, and the other Slavic languages such as Polish in relation to Bulgaro-Macedonian.&lt;ref name="Thomason (2000)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman (2000)"/&gt;

===Indian subcontinent===
In a classic 1956 paper titled "India as a Linguistic Area", [[Murray Emeneau]] laid the groundwork for the general acceptance of the concept of a sprachbund. In the paper, Emeneau observed that the subcontinent's [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages]] shared a number of features that were not inherited from a common source, but were [[areal features]], the result of diffusion during sustained contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
| last = Emeneau | first = Murray | year = 1956 | title = India as a Linguistic Area | journal = Language | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–16 | doi=10.2307/410649 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emeneau specified the tools to establish that language and culture had fused for centuries on the Indian soil to produce an integrated mosaic of structural convergence of four distinct language families: [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Tibeto-Burman]]. This concept provided scholarly substance for explaining the underlying Indian-ness of apparently divergent cultural and linguistic patterns. With his further contributions, this area has now become a major field of research in language contact and convergence.&lt;ref name="Thomason (2000)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Emeneau | first1=Murray | last2=Dil | first2=Anwar | title=Language and Linguistic Area: Essays by Murray B. Emeneau | year=1980 | place=Palo Alto | publisher=Stanford University Press | isbn=978-0-8047-1047-3 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Language contact | first = Sarah Grey | last = Thomason | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-7486-0719-8 | pages = 114–117 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainland Southeast Asia===
The [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] is one of the most dramatic of linguistic areas in terms of the surface similarity of the languages involved, to the extent that early linguists tended to group them all into a single family, although the modern consensus places them into numerous unrelated families.  The area stretches from Thailand to China and is home to speakers of languages of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Hmong–Mien]] (or Miao–Yao), [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]], [[Austronesian]] (represented by [[Chamic]]) and [[Mon–Khmer]] families.&lt;ref name="Enfield"&gt;{{citation
| title = Areal Linguistics and Mainland Southeast Asia | first = N.J. | last = Enfield | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | year = 2005
| pages = 181–206 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120406 | url = http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:57458:2/component/escidoc:57459/Enfield_2005_areal.pdf | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbouring languages across these families, though presumed unrelated, often have similar features, which are believed to have spread by diffusion.
A well-known example is the similar [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] systems in [[Sinitic languages]] (Sino-Tibetan), Hmong–Mien, [[Tai languages]] (Kadai) and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (Mon–Khmer).  Most of these languages passed through an earlier stage with three tones on most syllables (but no tonal distinctions on [[checked syllable]]s ending in a [[stop consonant]]), which was followed by a [[tone split]] where the distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants disappeared but in compensation the number of tones doubled.
These parallels led to confusion over the classification of these languages, until [[André-Georges Haudricourt|Haudricourt]] showed in 1954 that tone was not an invariant feature, by demonstrating that Vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other languages of the Mon–Khmer family, and proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin.&lt;ref name="Enfield"/&gt;

Similarly, the unrelated [[Khmer language|Khmer]] (Mon–Khmer), [[Cham language|Cham]] (Austronesian) and [[Lao language|Lao]] (Kadai) languages have almost identical vowel systems.
Many languages in the region are of the [[isolating languages|isolating]] (or analytic) type, with mostly monosyllabic morphemes and little use of [[inflection]] or [[affix]]es, though a number of Mon–Khmer languages have [[derivational morphology]].
Shared syntactic features include [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]s, [[OV language|object–verb order]] and [[topic–comment]] structure, though in each case there are exceptions in branches of one or more families.&lt;ref name="Enfield"/&gt;

===Northeast Asia===
Some linguists, such as [[Matthias Castrén]], [[Gustaf John Ramstedt|G. J. Ramstedt]], [[Nicholas Poppe]] and [[Pentti Aalto]] supported the idea that the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] families of Asia (and some small parts of Europe) are genetically related, in a controversial group they call [[Altaic languages|Altaic]]. [[Koreanic language|Koreanic]] and [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] languages, which are also hypothetically related according to some scholars like [[William George Aston]], Shōsaburō Kanazawa, [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel Martin]] and [[Sergei Starostin]], are sometimes included as part of the purported Altaic family. This latter hypothesis was supported by people including [[Roy Andrew Miller]], John C. Street and [[Karl Heinrich Menges]].
[[Gerard Clauson]], [[Gerhard Doerfer]], [[Juha Janhunen]], [[Stefan Georg]] and others dispute or reject this. A common alternative explanation for similarities between said-Altaic languages such as [[vowel harmony]] and [[agglutinative languages|agglutination]] is that they are due to areal diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Standings''' or '''rankings''' are listings which compare sports teams or individuals, institutions, nations, companies, or other entities by [[rankings|ranking]] them in order of ability or achievement. A table or chart (such as a league table, a ladder or a leaderboard) may be employed to display such listings. A league table may list several related statistics, but they are generally sorted by the primary one that determines the rankings. Many industries and institutions may compete in league tables in order to help bring in new customers and clients. Those tables ranking sports teams are generally used to help determine who may advance to the [[playoffs]] or another [[tournament]], who is [[Promotion and relegation|promoted or relegated]], or who gets a higher [[Draft (sports)|draft pick]].

In sport, '''league tables''' group teams of similar abilities in a chart to show the current standing of the participants (teams or individuals) in a sports [[List of professional sports leagues|league]] or competition. These lists are generally published in newspapers and other media, as well as the official web sites of the sports leagues and competitions.

At the very least, a league table will show the names of the teams and their points total or [[winning percentage]] (depending on the sport), sorted in order of points or percentage. However, many league tables show further statistics; these may include:
* wins
* losses
* [[tie (draw)|ties]] (draws)
* [[goal differential]] (Goals scored minus goals conceded)
** goals scored
** goals allowed (conceded)
* home/away win/loss records

Usually, if a league is divided into conferences and divisions, the league table will also be. Often, a less specific table is also included. For example, [[National Hockey League]] tables will normally have a detailed table for each division, plus a table for each conference showing just the points totals.

As an example, below is the league table for the [[Northeast Division (NHL)|Northeast Division]] of the National Hockey League, as of March 31, 2004:
 Team         GP   W   L   T  OL   GF   GA  Pts
 x-Boston     79  40  18  14   7  201  179  101
 x-Toronto    80  43  24  10   3  234  204   99
 x-Ottawa     79  41  22  10   6  254  178   98
 x-Montreal   79  40  28   7   4  201  182   91
 Buffalo      79  36  32   7   4  213  210   83
 
 x - clinched playoff spot
 y - clinched division championship

In the above table, an "'''x'''" placed before a team's name shows that the team has qualified for playoff position; other letters may be used to show that a team is guaranteed first place, has been eliminated from contention and so forth. From this table, we can see that [[Boston Bruins|Boston]], [[Toronto Maple Leafs|Toronto]], [[Ottawa Senators|Ottawa]] and [[Montreal Canadiens|Montreal]] are all guaranteed playoff positions; the absence of a "'''y'''" shows that the division championship is still to play for. Meanwhile, because [[Buffalo Sabres|Buffalo]] has no symbol at all, they are not out of playoff contention, but have yet to clinch a playoff position. The following day, a new league table would appear in newspapers, updated based on the previous night's games. Of course, the above table would also be accompanied by those of the other divisions in the league.

==Education==
League tables are used to compare the academic achievements of different institutions. [[College and university rankings]] order institutions in higher education by combinations of factors. In addition to entire institutions, specific programs, departments, and schools are ranked. These rankings usually are conducted by magazines, newspapers, governments and academics. For example, [[league tables of British universities]] are published annually by ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' and ''[[The Times]]''. The primary aim of these rankings is to inform potential applicants about British universities based on a range of criteria. Similarly, in countries like India, league tables are being developed and a popular magazine, Education World, published them based on data from ''TheLearningPoint.net''. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

It is complained that the ranking of England's schools to rigid guidelines that fail to take into account wider social conditions actually makes failing schools even worse. This is because the most involved parents will then avoid such schools, leaving only the children of non-ambitious parents to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 ({{ISBN|0-7862-8517-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
In business, league tables list the leaders in [[investment banking]] activity, enabling people to quickly analyze financial data. Companies which collect this kind of data include [[Dealogic]], [https://www.bloomberg.com Bloomberg L.P.] and [[Thomson Reuters]]. The [[Thomson Reuters league tables]] list the top financiers in a particular industry. Dealogic's league tables are rankings of investment banks in terms of the dollar volume of deals that investment banks work on. [https://www.bloomberg.com Bloomberg's] league tables provide an overview of top underwriters and legal advisers to securities deals, as well as fees netted from these transactions.

The first edition of the ''Almanac'' was published in 1972. The ''[[National Journal]]'' published biennial editions of the ''Almanac'' from 1984 through 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barone|first1=Michael|title=Read Almanac of American Politics 2014 introduction online|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/read-almanac-of-american-politics-2014-introduction-online/article/2534310|accessdate=10 August 2015|newspaper=The Washington Examiner|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Columbia Books &amp; Information Services became the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gold|first1=Hadas|authorlink=Hadas Gold|title=The Almanac of American Politics lives on|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/06/the-almanac-of-american-politics-lives-on-208479.html|accessdate=10 August 2015|publisher=Politico|date=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The ''Almanac'' is broken down alphabetically by [[U.S. state|state]], with each [[congressional district]] in each state profiled separately. The information provided by the ''Almanac'' includes:
*[[Demographics of the United States|Demographic]] information on each district, including income, racial distribution, and other statistics.
*Profiles of the [[Congressional representative]] from each district as well as each state's Senators, including voting record on key votes, [[advocacy group]] ratings, etc.; profiles of governors are also included.
*Individually written profiles of each district, commissioned for the ''Almanac''.
*In-depth profiles of every governor, Senator, and House member.
*Analysis of the 2014 midterm elections for Senate, House and governor races, and how those results shape the public policy debates in Congress and the nation.
*A breakdown of the votes cast in the last U.S. presidential election for all states and districts, including primaries.
*Campaign finance data on spending by all members of the [[U.S. Congress]] in their most recent election, including all-new listings of the “outside money” spent in those contests.
*Analysis of voter turnout in each state and congressional district for the last presidential and mid-term elections.
*More than 60 state and congressional district maps, the key votes cast by members of the House and Senate, and interest group ratings.

In addition, an overview look at each state is given, including prospects for the upcoming [[President of the United States|presidential]] election and demographic trends.

The 2014 and 2012 editions of the ''Almanac'' are both 1,838 pages long. The ''Almanac'' was first published in 1971; subsequent editions have appeared biennially since 1973. The main editors were originally [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]], now a writer at ''[[The Washington Examiner]]''; Grant Ujifusa; and Douglas Matthews. Matthews stopped contributing after the 1980 edition. Barone and Chuck McCutcheon authored the 2012 edition, and were joined by Sean Trende and Josh Kraushaar for the 2014 edition. The co-authors of the 2016 edition are Barone, [[Richard E. Cohen]], [[Charlie Cook]], and James A. Barnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kenny |first1=Kelly |title=Ballotpedia teams up with the Almanac of American Politics|url=http://ballotpedia.org/Almanac_of_American_Politics|accessdate=10 August 2015|publisher=[[Ballotpedia]]|date=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the fictional civilisation in Iain M. Banks' [[Culture series]] novels|other uses|culture (disambiguation)}}

'''The Culture''' is a fictional interstellar [[post-scarcity]] civilization or society created by the Scottish writer [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]] and features in a number of his [[Space opera|space opera novel]]s and works of [[short fiction]], collectively called the [[Culture series]].

In the series, the Culture is composed primarily of sentient beings of the pan-human variety, artificially intelligent sentient machines, and a small number of other sentient "alien" life forms. Machine intelligences range from human-equivalent drones to hyper-intelligent Minds. The Culture's economy is maintained automatically by its non-sentient machines, with high-level work entrusted to the Minds' subroutines, which allows its humanoid and drone citizens to indulge their passions, romances, hobbies, or other activities, without servitude. Many of the series' [[protagonist]]s are humanoids who choose to work for the Culture's elite diplomatic or espionage organisations, and interact with other civilisations whose citizens hold wildly different ideologies, morals, and technologies.

The Culture has a grasp of technology which is advanced relative to most of the other civilisations which share the galaxy. Most of the Culture's citizens do not live on planets but in or on artificial habitats, such as huge [[Orbital (The Culture)|orbitals]], or on ships, the largest of which are home to billions of individuals. Biologically, the Culture's citizens have been genetically enhanced to live for centuries, and have modified mental control over their physiology, including the ability to introduce a variety of [[psychoactive drug]]s into their systems, change biological sex, or switch off [[pain]] at will. Culture technology is able to transform individuals into vastly different body forms but, for unclear reasons, the Culture standard form remains fairly close to human.

A central [[Theme (narrative)|theme]] of the series is the ethical struggles which face the Culture when interacting with other societies - some of which brutalise their own members, pose threats to other civilisations, or threaten the Culture itself, the reactions to which conflict with the Culture's philosophy of peace and individual freedom. The Culture tends to make major decisions based on the consensus formed by its Minds and, if appropriate, its citizens. In one instance, a [[Direct democracy|direct democratic]] vote of trillions – the entire population – decided The Culture would go to war with a rival civilisation. Those who objected to the Culture's subsequent militarisation broke off from the meta-civilisation, forming their own separate civilisation; a hallmark of the Culture is its ambiguity. In contrast to the many interstellar societies and empires which share its fictional universe, the Culture is difficult to define, geographically or sociologically, and "fades out at the edges".&lt;ref name="Culture-notes"/&gt;

==Overview==
The Culture is characterized as being a [[post-scarcity]] society, having overcome most physical constraints on life and being an [[egalitarian]], stable society without the use of any form of force or compulsion, except where necessary to protect others.

[[Mind (The Culture)|Minds]], extremely powerful [[artificial intelligence]]s, have an important role. They administer this abundance for the benefit of all. As one commentator has said:

{{quote|Investing all power in his individualistic, sometime eccentric, but always benign, A.I. Minds, Banks knew what he was doing; this is the only way a liberal anarchy could be achieved, by taking what is best in humans and placing it beyond corruption, which means out of human control. The danger involved in this imaginative step, though, is clear; one of the problems with the Culture novels as novels is that the central characters, the Minds, are too powerful and, to put it bluntly, too good.&lt;ref name="Brown-2001-SCLIB"/&gt;|}}

The novels of the Culture cycle, therefore, mostly deal with people at the fringes of the Culture: diplomats, spies, or mercenaries; those who interact with other civilizations, and who do the Culture's dirty work in moving those societies closer to the Culture ideal, sometimes by force.

==Fictional history==
In this fictional universe, the Culture exists concurrently with human society on Earth. The time frame for the published Culture stories is from  1267 to roughly 2970, with Earth being contacted around 2100, though the Culture had covertly visited the planet in the 1970s in ''[[The State of the Art]]''.

The Culture itself is described as having been created when several humanoid species and machine sentiences reached a certain social level, and took not only their physical, but also their civilizational evolution into their own hands. In ''[[The Player of Games]]'', the Culture is described as having existed as a space-faring society for eleven thousand years. In ''[[The Hydrogen Sonata]]'', one of these founding civilisations was named as the Buhdren Federality.

==Society and culture==

===Economy===
The Culture is a symbiotic society of [[AI|artificial intelligences (AIs)]] (Minds and drones), [[humanoid]]s and other alien species who all share equal status. All essential work is performed (as far as possible) by non-sentient devices, freeing sentients to do only things that they enjoy (administrative work requiring sentience is undertaken by the AIs using a bare fraction of their mental power, or by people who take on the work out of free choice). As such, the Culture is a [[post-scarcity]] society, where technological advances ensure that no one lacks any material goods or services. As a consequence, the Culture has no need of economic constructs such as money (as is apparent when it deals with civilizations in which money is still important).  The Culture rejects all forms of economics based on anything other than voluntary activity. "Money implies poverty" is a common saying in the Culture.

===Language===
Marain is the Culture's shared [[constructed language]]. The Culture believes the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] that language influences thought, and Marain was designed by early Minds to exploit this effect, while also "appealing to poets, pedants, engineers and programmers".&lt;ref name="Marain-notes"/&gt; Designed to be represented either in binary or symbol-written form, Marain is also regarded as an aesthetically pleasing language by the Culture. The symbols of the Marain alphabet can be displayed in three-by-three grids of binary (yes/no, black/white) dots and thus correspond to nine-bit wide [[binary number]]s.&lt;ref name="Marain-notes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Banks |first=Iain M.|title=A few Notes on Marain |url=http://trevor-hopkins.com/banks/a-few-notes-on-marain.html |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related comments are made by the narrator in ''[[The Player of Games]]'' regarding [[gender-specific pronoun]]s, which Marain speakers do not use in typical conversation unless specifying one's gender is necessary, and by general reflection on the fact that Marain places much less structural emphasis on (or even lacks) concepts like possession and ownership, dominance and submission, and especially aggression. Many of these concepts would in fact be somewhat theoretical to the average Culture citizen. Indeed, the presence of these concepts in other civilizations signify the brutality and hierarchy associated with forms of empire that the Culture strives to avoid.

Marain itself is also open to encryption and dialect-specific implementations for different parts of the Culture. M1 is basic Nonary Marain, the three-by-three grid. All Culture citizens can communicate in this variant. Other variants include M8 through M16, which are encrypted by various degrees, and are typically used by the Contact Section. Higher level encryptions exist, the highest of these being M32. M32 and lower level encrypted signals are the province of Special Circumstances (SC). Use of M32 is reserved for extremely secret and reserved information and communication within Special Circumstances. That said, M32 has an air of notoriety in the Culture, and in the thoughts of most may best be articulated as "the Unbreakable, Inviolable, Holy of Holies Special Circumstances M32" as described by prospective SC agent Ulver Seich. Ships and Minds also have a slightly distasteful view of SC procedure associated with M32, one Ship Mind going so far as to object to the standard SC attitude of "Full scale, stark raving M32 don't-talk-about-this-or-we'll-pull-your-plugs-out-baby paranoia" on the use of the encryption (''[[Excession]]'').

===Laws===
There are no laws as such in the Culture. [[Social norm]]s are enforced by convention (personal reputation, "good manners", and by, as described in ''The Player of Games'', possible [[ostracism]] and [[Probation|involuntary supervision]] for more serious crimes). Minds generally refrain from using their all-seeing capabilities to influence people's reputations, though they are not necessarily themselves above judging people based on such observations, as described in ''Excession''. Minds also judge each other, with one of the more relevant criteria being the quality of their treatment of sentients in their care. [[Orbital (The Culture)|Hub]] Minds for example are generally nominated from well-regarded GSV (the largest class of ships) Minds, and then upgraded to care for the billions living on the artificial habitats.

The only serious prohibitions that seem to exist are against harming sentient beings, or forcing them into undertaking any act (another concept that seems unnatural to and is, in fact, almost unheard of by almost all Culture citizens). As mentioned in ''The Player of Games'', the Culture does have the occasional "crime of passion" (as described by an [[List of societies of the Culture setting#Azadians|Azadian]]) and the punishment was to be "slap-droned", or to have a drone assigned to follow the offender and "make sure [they] don't do it again".

While the enforcement in theory could lead to a [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]]-style surveillance society, in practice social convention among the Minds prohibits them from watching, or interfering in, citizens' lives unless requested, or unless they perceive severe risk. The practice of reading a sentient's mind without permission (something the Culture is technologically easily capable of) is also strictly taboo. The whole plot of ''[[Look to Windward]]'' relies on a Hub Mind not reading an agent's mind (with certain precautions in case this rule gets violated). Minds that do so anyway are considered deviant and shunned by other Minds (see [[GCU Grey Area|GCU ''Grey Area'']]). At one point it is said that if the Culture actually had written laws, the sanctity of one's own thoughts against the intrusion of others would be the first on the books (''Look To Windward'').

This gives some measure of privacy and protection; though the very nature of Culture society would, strictly speaking, make keeping secrets irrelevant: most of them would be considered neither shameful nor criminal. It does allow the Minds in particular to scheme amongst themselves in a very efficient manner, and occasionally withhold information.

=== Symbols ===
The Culture has no flag, symbol or logo. According to ''[[Consider Phlebas]]'', people can recognize items made by the Culture implicitly, by the way they are simple, efficient and aesthetic. The main outright symbol of the Culture, the one by which it is most explicitly and proudly recognized, is not a visual symbol, but its language, Marain, which is used far beyond the Culture itself. It is often employed in the galaxy as a de facto lingua franca among people who don't share a language. Even the main character of ''Consider Phlebas'', an enemy of the Culture, ready to die to help in its downfall, is fluent in Marain and uses it with other non-Culture characters out of sheer convenience.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It would have helped if the Culture had used some sort of emblem or logo; but, pointlessly unhelpful and unrealistic to the last, the Culture refused to place its trust in symbols. It maintained that it was what it was and had no need for such outward representation. The Culture was every single individual human and machine in it, not one thing. Just as it could not imprison itself with laws, impoverish itself with money or misguide itself with leaders, so it would not misrepresent itself with signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Banks |first=I.M. |title=Consider Phlebas |publisher=Orbit |isbn=1-85723-138-4 |year=1987 |chapter=The Eaters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Citizens==

===Biological===
The Culture is a [[Posthuman (Human evolution)|posthuman]] society, which originally arose when seven or eight roughly [[humanoid]] space-faring species coalesced into a quasi-collective (a group-civilization) ultimately consisting of approximately thirty [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] ([[long and short scales|short scale]]) sentient (more properly, sapient) beings (this includes artificial intelligences). In Banks's universe, a good part (but by no means an overwhelming percentage) of all sentient species is of the "pan-human" type, as noted in ''[[Matter (novel)|Matter]]''.

Although the Culture was originated by humanoid species, subsequent interactions with other civilizations have introduced many non-humanoid species into the Culture (including some former enemy civilizations), though the majority of the biological Culture is still pan-human. Little uniformity exists in the Culture, and its citizens are such by choice, free to change physical form and even species (though some stranger biological conversions are irreversible, and conversion from biological to artificial sentience is considered to be what is known as an Unusual Life Choice). All members are also free to join, leave, and rejoin, or indeed declare themselves to be, say, 80% Culture.

Within the novels, opponents of the Culture have argued that the role of humans in the Culture is nothing more than that of pets, or parasites on Culture Minds, and that they can have nothing genuinely useful to contribute to a society where science is close to omniscient about the physical universe, where every ailment has been cured, and where every thought can be read. Many of the Culture novels in fact contain characters (from within or without the Culture) wondering how far-reaching the Minds' dominance of the Culture is, and how much of the democratic process within it might in fact be a sham: subtly but very powerfully influenced by the Minds in much the same ways Contact and [[Special Circumstances]] influence other societies. Also, except for some mentions about a vote over the [[Idiran-Culture War]], and the existence of a very small number of "Referrers" (humans of especially acute reasoning), few biological entities are ever described as being involved in any high-level decisions.

On the other hand, the Culture can be seen as fundamentally [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] (one of the main objectives for any being, including Minds, is to have fun rather than to be "useful"). Also, Minds are constructed, by convention, to care for and value human beings. While a General Contact Unit (GCU) does not strictly need a crew (and could construct artificial avatars when it did), a real human crew adds richness to its existence, and offers distraction during otherwise dull periods. In ''[[Consider Phlebas]]'' it is noted that Minds still find humans fascinating, especially their odd ability to sometimes achieve similarly advanced reasoning as their much more complex machine brains.

To a large degree, the freedoms enjoyed by humans in the Culture are only available because Minds choose to provide them. The freedoms include the ability to leave the Culture when desired, often forming new associated but separate societies with Culture ships and Minds, most notably the Zetetic Elench and the ultra-pacifist and non-interventionist Peace Faction.

====Physiology====
Techniques in [[genetics]] have advanced in the Culture to the point where bodies can be freed from built-in limitations. Citizens of the Culture refer to a normal human as "human-basic" and the vast majority opt for significant enhancements: severed limbs grow back, sexual physiology can be voluntarily changed from male to female and back (though the process takes time),&lt;ref&gt;The Player of Games&lt;/ref&gt; sexual stimulation and endurance are strongly heightened in both sexes (something that is often subject of envious debate among other species), pain can be switched off, toxins can be bypassed away from the digestive system, autonomic functions such as heart rate can be switched to conscious control, reflexes like blinking can be switched off, and bones and muscles adapt quickly to changes in gravity without the need to exercise. The degree of enhancement found in Culture individuals varies to taste, with certain of the more exotic enhancements limited to Special Circumstances personnel (for example, weapons systems embedded in various parts of the body).

Most Culture individuals opt to have drug glands that allow for hormonal levels and other chemical secretions to be consciously monitored, released and controlled. These allow owners to secrete on command any of a wide selection of synthetic drugs, from the merely relaxing to the mind-altering: "Snap" is described in ''[[Use of Weapons]]'' and ''[[The Player of Games]]'' as "The Culture's favourite breakfast drug". "Sharp Blue" is described as a utility drug, as opposed to a sensory enhancer or a sexual stimulant, that helps in problem solving. "Quicken", mentioned in ''[[Excession]]'', speeds up the user's neural processes so that time seems to slow down, allowing them to think and have mental conversation (for example with artificial intelligences) in far less time than it appears to take to the outside observer. "Sperk", as described in ''Matter'', is a mood- and energy-enhancing drug, while other such self-produced drugs include "Calm", "Gain", "Charge", "Recall", "Diffuse", "Somnabsolute", "Softnow", "Focal", "Edge", "Drill", "Gung", "Winnow" and "Crystal Fugue State". The glanded substances have no permanent side-effects and are non-habit-forming.

====Phenotypes====
{{See also|List of civilisations in the Culture series}}
For all their genetic improvements, the Culture is by no means [[eugenics|eugenically]] uniform. Human members in the Culture setting vary in size, colour and shape as in reality, and with possibly even further natural differences: in the novella ''The State of the Art'', it is mentioned that a character "looks like a Yeti", and that there is variance among the Culture in minor details such as the number of toes or of joints on each finger. It is mentioned in ''Excession'' that:

{{quote|"the tenor of the time had generally turned against ... outlandishness and people had mostly returned to looking more like people over the last millennium", previously "as the fashions of the intervening times had ordained&amp;nbsp;– people ... had resembled birds, fish, dirigible balloons, snakes, small clouds of cohesive smoke and animated bushes".}}

Some Culture citizens opt to leave the constraints of a human or even humanoid body altogether, opting to take on the appearance of one of the myriad other galactic sentients (perhaps in order to live with them) or even non-sentient objects as commented upon in ''Matter'' (though this process can be irreversible if the desired form is too removed from the structure of the human brain). Certain eccentrics have chosen to become drones or even Minds themselves, though this is considered rude and possibly even insulting by most humans and AIs alike.

While the Culture is generally pan-humanoid (and tends to call itself "human"), various other species and individuals of other species have become part of the Culture.

As all Culture citizens are of perfect genetic health, the very rare cases of a Culture citizen showing any physical deformity are almost certain to be a sort of fashion statement of somewhat dubious taste.

====Personality====
Almost all Culture citizens are very sociable, of great intellectual capability and learning, and possess very well-balanced psyches. Their biological make-up and their growing up in an enlightened society make neuroses and lesser emotions like greed or (strong) jealousy practically unknown, and produce persons that, in any lesser society, appear very self-composed and charismatic. Character traits like strong shyness, while very rare, are not fully unknown, as shown in ''Excession''. As described there and in ''Player of Games'', a Culture citizen who becomes dysfunctional enough to pose a serious nuisance or threat to others would be offered (voluntary) psychological adjustment therapy and might potentially find himself under constant (non-voluntary) oversight by representatives of the local Mind. In extreme cases, as described in ''Use of Weapons'' and ''[[Surface Detail]]'', dangerous individuals have been known to be assigned a "slap-drone", a robotic follower who ensures that the person in question doesn't continue to endanger the safety of others.

===Artificial===
As well as humans and other biological species, sentient artificial intelligences are also members of the Culture. These can be broadly categorised into drones and Minds. Also, by custom, as described in ''Excession'', any artifact (be it a tool or vessel) above a certain capability level has to be given sentience.

====Drones====
Drones are roughly comparable in intelligence and social status to that of the Culture's biological members. Their intelligence is measured against that of an average biological member of the Culture; a so-called "1.0 value" drone would be considered the mental equal of a biological citizen, whereas lesser drones such as the menial service units of Orbitals are merely proto-sentient (capable of limited reaction to unprogrammed events, but possessing no consciousness, and thus not considered citizens; these take care of much of the menial work in the Culture). The sentience of advanced drones has various levels of redundancy, from systems similar to that of Minds (though much reduced in capability) down to electronic, to mechanical and finally biochemical back-up brains.

Although drones are artificial, the parameters that prescribe their minds are not rigidly constrained, and sentient drones are full individuals, with their own personalities, opinions and quirks. Like biological citizens, Culture drones generally have lengthy names. They also have a form of sexual intercourse for pleasure, called being "in thrall", though this is an intellect-only interfacing with another sympathetic drone.

While civilian drones do generally match humans in intelligence, drones built especially as Contact or Special Circumstances agents are often several times more intelligent, and imbued with extremely powerful senses, powers and armaments (usually forcefield and effector-based, though occasionally more destructive weaponry such as lasers or, exceptionally, "knife-missiles" are referred to) all powered by antimatter reactors. Despite being purpose built, these drones are still allowed individual personalities and given a choice in lifestyle. Indeed, some are eventually deemed psychologically unsuitable as agents (for example as Mawhrin-Skel notes about itself in ''The Player of Games'') and must choose (or choose to choose){{huh|date=February 2018}} either mental reprofiling or demilitarisation and discharge from Special Circumstances.

Physically, drones are floating units of various sizes and shapes, usually with no visible moving parts. Drones get around the limitations of this inanimation with the ability to project "fields": both those capable of physical force, which allow them to manipulate objects, as well as visible, coloured fields called "auras", which are used to enable the drone to express emotion. There is a complex drone code based on aura colours and patterns (which is fully understood by biological Culture citizens as well). Drones have full control of their auras and can display emotions they're not feeling or can switch their aura off. The drone, Jase, in ''Consider Phlebas'', is described as being constructed before the use of auras, and refuses to be retrofitted with them, preferring to remain inscrutable.

In size drones vary substantially: the oldest still alive (eight or nine thousand years old) tend to be around the size of humans, whereas later technology allows drones to be small enough to lie in a human's cupped palm; modern drones may be any size between these extremes according to fashion and personal preference. Some drones are also designed as utility equipment with its own sentience, such as the gelfield protective suit described in ''Excession''.

====Minds====
{{Main|Mind (The Culture)}}
By contrast to drones, Minds are orders of magnitude more powerful and intelligent than the Culture's other biological and artificial citizens. Typically they inhabit and act as the controllers of large-scale Culture hardware such as ships or space-based habitats. Unsurprisingly, given their duties, Minds are tremendously powerful: capable of running all of the functions of a ship or habitat, while holding potentially billions of simultaneous conversations with the citizens that live aboard them. To allow them to perform at such a high degree, they exist partially in hyperspace to get around hindrances to computing power such as the speed of light.

During the time of ''Consider Phlebas'', Minds were estimated to number in the several hundreds of thousands.

Ship-based Culture Minds choose the names of the craft they inhabit, and their choices are often whimsical and humorous. Ships are identified by a three-letter prefix denoting class (such as GSV or GCU), followed by their personal name, such as:

*''Anticipation Of A New Lover's Arrival, The''
*''Just Testing''
*''Sense Amid Madness, Wit Amidst Folly''

Presumably to avoid the cumbersome repetition of such long names, the inhabitants of ships and habitats tend to refer to the overseeing local Mind simply as the "Ship" or the "Hub", for example.

Culture military craft are often designed to be ugly and graceless, lacking the Culture's usual aesthetic style, and it has been theorised that this is because Culture citizens wish to distance themselves from the military aspects of their society. Their ship classes, reflecting the Culture's profound distaste of war and resultant refusal to disguise their weapons with euphemisms, are always unpleasant (such as the Gangster, Torturer, Psychopath, Thug and Abominator classes). Their self-given names are often tinged with menace (but still tend to be whimsical), such as:

*''All Through With This Niceness And Negotiation Stuff''
*''Attitude Adjuster''
*''Killing Time''
*''Frank Exchange Of Views''
*''Falling Outside The Normal Moral Constraints''

{{See also|List of spacecraft in the Culture series}}
Since the Mind concerned chooses its own name this may sometimes even indicate a degree of self-hatred over its purpose for existence. Warship Minds are somewhat out of the normal Culture's behaviour range, designed to be more aggressive and less ambivalent about violence than the usual Culture citizen. Some such Minds choose to "sleep" in between periods of conflict, due to their boredom and uneasiness with typical existence in the Culture.  It is stated in ''Excession'' that the Minds of warships are backed up without fail, giving them a form of immortality which is considered crucial for them to be able to take the risk of going into combat; for other ships, backing up their Minds is typical but optional, and a few minds do choose to live with the possibility of real death (or even to commit suicide, typically by switching off their power cores, although a more painful death can be achieved by channelling energy from their engines into the "brain" of the ship).

Minds generally view their crew/inhabitants as "interesting companions" and interact with them through remotely controlled devices, often drones or humanoid "avatars". Examples of more diverse interactive systems are animals such as small fish suspended in their own anti-gravity sphere of water.

As a sidenote, the fact that artificial intelligences are accepted as citizens of the Culture was a major factor in the [[Idiran-Culture War]], which is explored in ''Consider Phlebas''. This citizenship of AIs (which the Culture promotes in other societies it encounters) has other more general consequences. For instance, despite a high degree of automation within Culture technology, menial tasks are often undertaken by non-sentient technology, to avoid the exploitation of sentient lifeforms (though Minds often work at administrative tasks using bare fractions of their enormous mental capabilities).

===Names===
Some humanoid or drone Culture citizens have long names, often with seven or more words. Some of these words specify the citizen's origin (place of birth or manufacture), some an occupation, and some may denote specific philosophical or political alignments (chosen later in life by the citizen themselves), or make other similarly personal statements. An example would be Diziet Sma, whose full name is Rasd-Coduresa Diziet Embless Sma da' Marenhide:
* ''Rasd-Coduresa'' is the [[planetary system]] of her birth, and the specific object ([[planet]], [[Orbital (The Culture)|orbital]], [[Dyson sphere]], etc.). The ''-sa'' suffix is roughly equivalent to ''-er'' in English. By this convention, Earth humans would all be named ''[[Sun]]-[[Earth]]sa'' (or ''Sun-Earther'').
* ''Diziet'' is her given name. This is chosen by a parent, usually the mother.
* ''Embless'' is her chosen name. Most Culture citizens choose this when they reach adulthood (according to ''The Player of Games'' this is known as "completing one's name"). As with all conventions in the Culture, it may be broken or ignored: some change their chosen name during their lives, some never take one.
* ''Sma'' is her surname, usually taken from one's mother.
* ''da' Marenhide'' is the house or estate she was raised within, the ''da{{'}}'' or ''dam'' being similar to ''von'' in German.  (The usual formation is ''dam''; ''da{{'}}'' is used in Sma's name because the house name begins with an M, eliding an awkward phoneme repetition.)
Iain Banks gave his own Culture name as "Sun-Earther Iain El-Bonko Banks of [[North Queensferry]]".&lt;ref name="Culture-notes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Banks |first=Iain M. |authorlink=Iain Banks |date=10 August 1994 |title=A Few Notes on the Culture |url=http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm}} Originally posted on rec.arts.sf newsgroup.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Culture]] --&gt;
The Culture has a relatively relaxed attitude towards death. Genetic manipulation and the continual benevolent surveillance of the Minds make natural or accidental death almost unknown. Advanced technology allows citizens to make backup copies of their personalities, allowing them to be [[Resurrection|resurrected]] in case of death. The form of that resurrection can be specified by the citizen, with personalities returning either in the same biological form, in an artificial form (see below), or even just within [[virtual reality]]. Some citizens choose to go into "storage" (a form of suspended animation) for long periods of time, out of boredom or curiosity about the future.

Attitudes individual citizens have towards death are varied (and have varied throughout the Culture's history).  While many, if not most, citizens make some use of backup technology, many others do not, preferring instead to risk death without the possibility of recovery (for example when engaging in [[extreme sports]]). These citizens are sometimes called "disposables", and are described in ''Look to Windward''. Taking into account such accidents, voluntary [[euthanasia]] for emotional reasons, or choices like [[the Sublimed|sublimation]], the average lifespan of humans is described in ''Excession'' as being around 350 to 400 years. Some citizens choose to forgo death altogether, although this is rarely done and is viewed as an eccentricity. Other options instead of death include conversion of an individual's consciousness into an AI, joining of a group mind (which can include biological and non-biological consciousnesses), or subliming (usually in association with a group mind).

Concerning the lifespan of drones and Minds, given the durability of Culture technology and the options of mindstate backups, it is reasonable to assume that they live as long as they choose. Even Minds, with their utmost complexity, are known to be backed up (and reactivated if they for example die in a risky mission, see ''[[GSV Lasting Damage]]''). It is noted that even Minds themselves do not necessarily live forever either, often choosing to eventually sublime or even killing themselves (as does the double-Mind ''[[GSV Lasting Damage]]'' due to its choices in the Culture-Idiran war).

==Science and technology==

===Anti-gravity and forcefields===
The Culture (and other societies) have developed powerful [[anti-gravity]] abilities, closely related to their ability to manipulate forces themselves.

In this ability they can create [[action-at-a-distance]]&amp;nbsp;– including forces capable of pushing, pulling, cutting, and even fine manipulation, and forcefields for protection, visual display or plain destructive ability. Such applications still retain restrictions on range and power: while forcefields of many cubic kilometres are possible (and in fact, orbitals are held together by forcefields), even in the chronologically later novels, such as ''Look to Windward'', spaceships are still used for long-distance travel and drones for many remote activities.

With the control of a Mind, fields can be manipulated over vast distances.  In ''Use of Weapons'', a Culture warship uses its electromagnetic effectors to hack into a computer light years away.

===Artificial intelligence===
{{Main|Mind (The Culture)}}
Artificial intelligences (and to a lesser degree, the non-sentient computers omnipresent in all material goods), form the backbone of the technological advances of the Culture. Not only are they the most advanced scientists and designers the Culture has, their lesser functions also oversee the vast (but usually hidden) production and maintenance capabilities of the society.

The Culture has achieved artificial intelligences where each Mind has thought processing capabilities many orders of magnitude beyond that of human beings, and data storage drives which, if written out on paper and stored in filing cabinets, would cover thousands of planets skyscraper high (as described by one Mind in ''Consider Phlebas''). Yet it has managed to condense these entities to a volume of several dozen cubic metres (though much of the contents and the operating structure are continually in hyperspace). Minds also demonstrate reaction times and multitasking abilities orders of magnitude greater than any sentient being; armed engagements between Culture and equivalent technological civilizations sometimes occur in timeframes as short as microseconds,&lt;ref&gt;Excession, Pg. 396&lt;/ref&gt; and standard Orbital Minds are capable of running all of the vital systems on the Orbital while simultaneously conversing with millions of the inhabitants and observing phenomena in the surrounding regions of space.&lt;ref&gt;Look to Windward, Pg. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, it has achieved drone sentiences and capability of Special Circumstance proportions in forms that could fit easily within a human hand, and built extremely powerful (though not sentient) computers capable of fitting into tiny insect-like drones. Some utilitarian devices (such as spacesuits) are also provided with artificial sentience. These specific types of drones, like all other Culture AI, would also be considered citizens - though as described in the short story "Descendant", they may spend most of the time when their "body" is not in use in a form of remote-linked existence outside of it, or in a form of AI-level virtual reality.

===Energy manipulation===
A major feature of its [[post-scarcity]] society, the Culture is obviously able to gather, manipulate, transfer and store vast amounts of energy. While not explained in detail in the novels, this involves [[antimatter]] and "grid energy", a postulated energy field dividing the universe from a mirroring anti-matter universe, and providing practically limitless energy. Transmission or storage of such energy is not explained, though these capabilities must be powerful as well, with tiny drones capable of very powerful manipulatory fields and forces.

The Culture also uses various forms of energy manipulation as weapons, with '''"gridfire"''', a method of creating a dimensional rift to the energy grid, releasing astronomical amounts of energy into a region of non-hyperspace, being described as a sort of ultimate weapon more destructive than condensed antimatter bombardment. One character in ''Consider Phlebas'' refers to gridfire as "the weaponry of the end of the universe". Gridfire resembles the [[zero-point energy]] used within many popular science fiction stories.

===Matter displacement===
The Culture (at least by the time of ''The Player of Games'') has developed a form of [[teleportation]] capable of transporting both living and unliving matter instantaneously via wormholes. This technology has not rendered spacecraft obsolete&amp;nbsp;– in ''Excession'' a barely apple-sized drone was displaced no further than a light-second at maximum range (mass being a limiting factor determining range), a tiny distance in galactic terms. The process also still has a very small chance of failing and killing living beings, but the chance is described as being so small (1 in 61 million)&lt;ref name="Banks2000LTW"/&gt;{{rp|363}} that it normally only becomes an issue when transporting a large number of people and is only regularly brought up due to the Culture's safety conscious nature.

Displacement is an integral part of Culture technology, being widely used for a range of applications from peaceful to belligerent. Displacing warheads into or around targets is one of the main forms of attack in space warfare in the Culture universe. ''The Player of Games'' mentions that drones can be displaced to catch a person falling from a cliff before they impact the ground, as well.

===Brain–computer interfaces===
{{See also|The Culture#Death|l1=Death in the Culture}}
Through "neural lace", a form of [[brain–computer interface]] that is implanted into the brains of young people and grows with them, the Culture has the capability to read and store the full sentience of any being, biological or artificial, and thus reactivate a stored being after its death.&lt;ref name=Ars&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newitz|first1=Annalee|title=Elon Musk is setting up a company that will link brains and computers|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/03/elon-musk-is-setting-up-a-company-that-will-link-brains-and-computers/|work=Ars Technica|date=March 27, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neural lace also allows wireless communication with the [[Mind (The Culture)|Minds]] and databases.&lt;ref name=1843cross&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cross|first1=Tim|title=The novelist who inspired Elon Musk|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/culture/the-daily/the-novelist-who-inspired-elon-musk|publisher=1843 Magazine|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This also necessitates the capability to read thoughts, but as described in ''Look to Windward'', doing this without permission is considered taboo.&lt;ref&gt;Look to Windward&lt;/ref&gt;

===Starships and warp drives===
{{Main|List of spacecraft in the Culture series}}
Starships are living spaces, vehicles and ambassadors of the Culture. A proper Culture starship (as defined by hyperspace capability and the presence of a Mind to inhabit it) may range from several hundreds of metres to hundreds of kilometres. The latter may be inhabited by billions of beings and are artificial worlds in their own right, including whole [[ecosystem]]s, and are considered to be self-contained representations of all aspects of Culture life and capability.

The Culture (and most other space-faring species in its universe) use a form of [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|Hyperspace]]-drive to achieve [[faster-than-light]] speeds. Banks has evolved a (self-confessedly) [[technobabble]] system of theoretical physics to describe the ships' acceleration and travel, using such concepts as "infraspace" and "ultraspace" and an "energy grid" between universes (from which the warp engines "push off" to achieve momentum). An "induced singularity" is used to access infra or ultra space from real space; once there, "engine fields" reach down to the Grid and gain power and traction from it as they travel at high speeds.&lt;ref&gt;Excession&lt;/ref&gt;

These hyperspace engines do not use reaction mass and hence do not need to be mounted on the surface of the ship. They are described as being very dense [[exotic matter]], which only reveals its complexity under a powerful microscope. Acceleration and maximum speed depend on the ratio of the mass of the ship to its engine mass. As with any other matter aboard, ships can gradually manufacture extra engine volume or break it down as needed. In ''Excession'' one of the largest ships of the Culture redesigns itself to be mostly engine and reaches a speed of 233,000 times [[lightspeed]]. Within the range of the Culture's influence in the galaxy, most ships would still take years of travelling to reach the more remote spots.

Other than the engines used by larger Culture ships, there are a number of other propulsion methods such as gravitic drive at sublight speeds, with antimatter, fusion and other reaction engines occasionally seen with less advanced civilizations, or on Culture hobby craft.

Warp engines can be very small, with Culture drones barely larger than fist-size described as being thus equipped. There is also at least one (apparently non-sentient) species (the "Chuy-Hirtsi" animal), that possesses the innate capability of warp travel. In ''Consider Phlebas'', it is being used as a military transport by the [[Idiran]]s, but no further details are given.

===Nanotechnology===
The Culture has highly advanced [[nanotechnology]], though descriptions of such technology in the books is limited. Many of the described uses are by or for [[Special Circumstances]], but there are no indications that the use of nanotechnology is limited in any way. (In a passage in one of the books, there is a brief reference to the question of sentience when comparing the human brain or a "pico-level substrate".)

One of the primary clandestine uses of nanotechnology is information gathering. The Culture likes to be in the know, and as described in ''Matter'' "they tend to know everything." Aside from its vast network of sympathetic allies and wandering Culture citizens one of the primary ways that the Culture keeps track of important events is by the use of practically invisible nanobots capable of recording and transmitting their observations. This technique is described as being especially useful to track potentially dangerous people (such as ex-Special Circumstance agents). Via such nanotechnology, it is potentially possible for the Culture (or similarly advanced societies) to see everything happening on a given planet, orbital or any other habitat. The usage of such devices is limited by various treaties and agreements among the Involved.

In addition, EDust assassins are potent Culture terror weapons, composed entirely of nano machines called EDust, or "Everything Dust." They are capable of taking almost any shape or form, including swarms of insects or entire humans or aliens, and possess powerful weaponry capable of levelling entire buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Look to Windward, Pg. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living space==
Much of the Culture's population lives on [[Orbital (The Culture)|orbital]]s, vast artificial worlds that can accommodate billions of people. Others travel the galaxy in huge space ships such as General Systems Vehicles (GSVs) that can accommodate hundreds of millions of people. Almost no Culture citizens are described as living on planets, except when visiting other civilizations. The reason for this is partly because the Culture believes in containing its own expansion to self-constructed habitats, instead of colonising or conquering new planets. With the resources of the universe allowing permanent expansion (at least assuming non-exponential growth), this frees them from having to compete for living space.

The Culture, and other civilizations in Banks' universe, are described as living in these various, often constructed habitats:

===Airspheres===
These are vast, [[brown dwarf|brown dwarf-sized]] bubbles of atmosphere enclosed by force fields, and (presumably) set up by an ancient advanced race at least one and a half billion years ago. There is only minimal gravity within an airsphere. They are illuminated by moon-sized orbiting planetoids that emit enormous light beams.

Citizens of the Culture live there only very occasionally as guests, usually to study the complex ecosystem of the airspheres and the dominant life-forms: the "dirigible behemothaurs" and "gigalithine lenticular entities", which may be described as inscrutable, ancient intelligences looking similar to a cross between gigantic blimps and whales. The airspheres slowly migrate around the galaxy, taking anywhere from 50 to 100 million years to complete one circuit. In the novels no one knows who created the airspheres or why, but it is presumed that whoever did has long since sublimed but may maintain some obscure link with the behemothaurs and lenticular entities. Guests in the airspheres are not allowed to use any force-field technology, though no reason has been offered for this prohibition.

The airspheres resemble in some respects the orbit-sized ring of breathable atmosphere created by Larry Niven in ''[[The Integral Trees]]'', but spherical not toroidal, require a force field to retain their integrity, and arose by artificial rather than natural processes.

===Orbitals===
{{Main|Orbital (The Culture)}}
One of the main types of habitats of the Culture, an orbital is a ring structure orbiting a star as would a planet. Unlike a [[Ringworld]] or a [[Dyson Sphere]], an orbital does not enclose the star (being much too small). Like a ringworld, the orbital rotates to provide an analog of gravity on the inner surface. A Culture orbital rotates about once every 24 hours and has gravity-like effect about the same as the gravity of Earth, making the diameter of the ring about {{Convert|3000000|km}}, and ensuring that the inhabitants experience night and day. Orbitals feature prominently in many Culture stories.

===Planets===
Though many other civilizations in the Culture books live on planets, the Culture as it currently exists has little direct connection to planet life.  Banks has written that he presumes this to be an inherent consequence of space colonization, and a foundation of the liberal nature of the Culture. A small number of home worlds of the founding member species of the Culture are mentioned in passing, and a few hundred human-habitable worlds were colonised (some being terraformed) before the Culture chose to turn towards artificial habitats, preferring to keep the planets it encounters wild. Since then, terraforming has become looked down on by the Culture as inelegant, ecologically problematic and possibly even immoral. Less than one percent of the population of the Culture lives on planets, and many find the very concept a bit bizarre.

This respect is not absolute though; in ''Consider Phlebas'', some Minds suggest testing a new technology on a "spare planet" (knowing that it could be destroyed in an antimatter explosion if unsuccessful). It should be assumed from their normal ethics, that this planet would have been lifeless to start with.  It is also quite possible, even probable, that the suggestion was not made in complete seriousness.

===Rings===
[[Ringworld]]-like megastructures exist in the Culture universe but are referred to simply as "Rings" with a capital ''R''. These habitats are not described in detail but one is recorded as having been destroyed (along with 3 Spheres) in the Idiran-Culture war. In ''Matter'', the Morthanveld people possesses ringworldlike structures made of innumerable various-sized tubes. Those structures encircle a star just like [[Larry Niven|Niven]]'s Ringworld and are about the same size.

===Rocks===
These are asteroids and other non-planetary bodies hollowed out for habitation and usually spun for centrifugal artificial gravity. Rocks (with the exception of those used for secretive purposes) are described as having faster-than-light space drives, and thus can be considered a special form of spaceship. Like Orbitals, they are usually administered by one or more Minds.

Rocks do not play a large part in most of the Culture stories, though their use as storage for mothballed military ships (''Pittance'') and habitats (''Phage Rock'', one of the founding communities of the Culture) are both key plot points in ''Excession''.

===Shellworlds===
Shellworlds are introduced in ''Matter'', and consist of multilayered levels of concentric spheres in four dimensions held up by innumerable titanic interior towers. Their extra dimensional characteristics render some products of Culture technology too dangerous to use and yet others ineffective, notably access to hyperspace. About 4000 were built millions of years ago as vast machines intended to cast a forcefield around the whole of the galaxy for unknown purposes; less than half of those remain at the time of ''Matter'', many having been destroyed by a departed species known as the Iln. The species that developed this technology, known as the Veil or the Involucra, are now lost, and many of the remaining shellworlds have become inhabited, often by many different species throughout their varying levels. Many still hold deadly secret defence mechanisms, often leading to great danger for their new inhabitants, giving them one of their other nicknames: Slaughter Worlds.

===Ships===
{{Main|List of ships of the Culture setting}}
Ships in the Culture are intelligent individuals, often of very large size, controlled by one or more Minds. The ship is considered{{by whom|date=November 2015}} the Mind's body (compare avatars). Some ships (GSVs, for example) are tens or even hundreds of kilometers in length and may have millions or even billions of residents who live on them full-time; together with Orbitals, such ships represent the main form of habitat for the Culture. Such large ships may temporarily contain smaller ships with their own populations, and/or manufacture such ships themselves.

In ''Use of Weapons'', the protagonist Zakalwe is allowed to acclimatise himself to the Culture by wandering for days through the habitable levels of a ship (the GSV ''Size Isn't Everything'', which is described as over {{Convert|80|km}} long), eating and sleeping at the many locations which provide food and accommodation throughout the structure and enjoying the various forms of contact possible with the friendly and accommodating inhabitants.

===Spheres===
[[Dyson sphere]]s also exist in the Culture universe but receive only passing mention as "Spheres". Three spheres are recorded as having been destroyed in the Idiran-Culture war.

==&lt;span id="Interaction with other civilisations"&gt; Interaction with other civilizations &lt;/span&gt;==
{{See also|List of civilisations in the Culture series}}
The Culture, living mostly on massive spaceships and in artificial habitats, and also feeling no need for [[conquest (military)|conquest]] in the typical sense of the word, possesses no borders. Its sphere of influence is better defined by the (current) concentration of Culture ships and habitats as well as the measure of effect its example and its interventions have already had on the "local" population of any galactic sector. As the Culture is also a very graduated and constantly evolving society, its societal boundaries are also constantly in flux (though they tend to be continually expanding during the novels), peacefully "absorbing" societies and individuals.

While the Culture is one of the most advanced and most powerful of all galactic civilizations, it is but one of the "high-level Involved" (called "Optimae" by some less advanced civilizations), the most powerful non-sublimed civilizations which mentor or control the others.

An Involved society is a highly advanced group that has achieved galaxy-wide involvement with other cultures or societies. There are a few dozen Involved societies and hundreds or thousands of well-developed (interstellar) but insufficiently influential societies or cultures; there are also well-developed societies known as "galactically mature" which do not take a dynamic role in the galaxy as a whole. In the novels, the Culture might be considered the premier Involved society, or at least the most dynamic and energetic, especially given that the Culture itself is a growing multicultural fusion of Involved societies. The Involved are contrasted with the Sublimed, groups that have reached a high level of technical development and galactic influence but subsequently abandoned physical reality, ceasing to take serious interventionist interest in galactic civilization. They are also contrasted with what some Culture people loosely refer to as "barbarians", societies of intelligent beings which lack the technical capacity to know about or take a serious role in their interstellar neighbourhood. There are also the elder civilisations, which are civilizations that reached the required level of technology for sublimation, but chose not to, and have retreated from the larger galactic meta-civilization.

The Involved are also contrasted with [[hegemonising swarm]]s (a term used in several of Banks' Culture novels).  These are entities that exist to convert as much of the universe as possible into more of themselves; most typically these are technological in nature, resembling more sophisticated forms of [[grey goo]], but the term can be applied to cultures that are sufficiently single-minded in their devotion to mass conquest, control, and colonisation.  Both the Culture and the author (in his ''Notes on the Culture'') find this behavior [[Quixotism|quixotic]] and ridiculous.  Most often, societies categorized as hegemonising swarms consist of species or groups newly arrived in the galactic community with highly expansionary and exploitative goals.  The usage of the term "hegemonising swarm" in this context is considered derisive in the Culture and among other Involved and is used to indicate their low regard for those with these ambitions by comparing their behavior to that of mindless self-replicating technology.  The Culture's central moral dilemma regarding intervention in other societies can be construed as a conflict between the desire to help others and the desire to avoid becoming a hegemonising swarm themselves.

===Foreign policy===
Although they lead a comfortable life within the Culture, many of its citizens feel a need to be useful and to belong to a society that does not merely exist for their own sake but that also helps improve the lot of sentient beings throughout the galaxy. For that reason the Culture carries out "good works", covertly or overtly interfering in the development of lesser civilizations, with the main aim to gradually guide them towards less damaging paths. As Culture citizens see it these good works provide the Culture with a "moral right to exist".

A group within the Culture, known as Contact, is responsible for its interactions (diplomatic or otherwise) with other civilizations (though non-Contact citizens are apparently not prevented from travelling or interacting with other civilizations). Further within Contact, an intelligence organisation named Special Circumstances exists to deal with interventions which require more covert behaviour; the interventionist approach that the Culture takes to advancing other societies may often create resentment in the affected civilizations and thus requires a rather delicate touch.

In ''Matter'', it is described that there are a number of other galactic civilizations that come close to or potentially even surpass the Culture in power and sophistication. The Culture is very careful and considerate of these groupings, and while still trying to convince them of the Culture ideal, will be much less likely to openly interfere in their activities.

In ''Surface Detail'', three more branches of Contact are described: Quietus, the Quietudinal Service, whose purview is dealing with those entities who have retired from biological existence into digital form and/or those who have died and been resurrected; Numina, which is described as having the charge of contact with races that have sublimed; and Restoria, a subset of Contact which focuses on containing and negating the threat of swarms of self-replicating creatures ("hegswarms").

===Behaviour in war===
While the Culture is normally pacifist, Contact historically acts as its military arm in times of war and Special Circumstances can be considered its [[secret service]] and its [[military intelligence]]. During war, most of the strategic and tactical decisions are taken by the Minds, with apparently only a small number of especially gifted humans, the "Referrers", being involved in the top-level decisions, though they are not shown outside ''Consider Phlebas''. It is shown in ''Consider Phlebas'' that actual decisions to go to war (as opposed to purely defensive actions) are based on a vote of all Culture citizens, presumably after vigorous discussion within the whole society.

It is described in various novels that the Culture is extremely reluctant to go to war, though it may start to prepare for it long before its actual commencement. In the Idiran-Culture War (possibly one of the most hard-fought wars for the normally extremely superior Culture forces), various star systems, stellar regions and many orbital habitats were overrun by the Idirans before the Culture had converted enough of its forces to military footing. The Culture Minds had had enough foresight to evacuate almost all its affected citizens (apparently numbering in the many billions) in time before actual hostilities reached them. As shown in ''Player of Games'', this is a standard Culture tactic, with its strong emphasis on protecting its citizens rather than sacrificing some of them for short-term goals.

War within the Culture is mostly fought by the Culture's sentient warships, the most powerful of these being war-converted GSVs, which are described as powerful enough to oppose whole enemy fleets. The Culture has little use for conventional ground forces (as it rarely occupies enemy territory); combat drones equipped with knife missiles do appear in ''Descendant'' and "[[Terror weapon (The Culture)|terror weapons]]" (basically intelligent, nano-form assassins) are mentioned in ''Look to Windward'', while infantry combat suits of great power (also usable as capable combat drones when without living occupants) are used in ''Matter''.

==Relevance to real-world politics==

The inner workings of The Culture are not especially described in detail though it is shown that the society is populated by an empowered, educated and augmented citizery in a direct democracy or highly democratic and transparent system of self-governance. In comparisons to the real world, intended or not, the Culture could resemble various posited egalitarian societies including in the writings of Karl Marx: the end condition of communism after a [[withering away of the state]], the anarchism of [[Bakunin]] and [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]] et al, [[libertarian socialism]], [[council communism]] and anarcho-communism. Other characteristics of The Culture that are recognizable in real world politics include [[pacifism]], [[post-capitalism]], and [[transhumanism]]. Banks deliberately portrayed an imperfect utopia whose imperfection or weakness is related to its interaction with the 'other', that is, exterior civilizations and species that are sometimes variously warred with or mishandled through the Culture's Contact section which cannot always control its intrigues and the individuals it either 'employs' or interacts with. This 'dark side' of The Culture also alludes to or echoes mistakes and tragedies in 20th century Marxist-Leninist countries although the Culture is generally portrayed as far more 'humane' and just.

===Utopia===
Comparisons are often made between the Culture and twentieth and twenty first century Western civilization and nation-states, particularly their interventions in less-developed societies. These are often confused with regard to the author's assumed politics.&lt;ref name="Brown-2001-SCLIB"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = C. | title = 'Special Circumstances': Intervention by a Liberal Utopia | doi = 10.1177/03058298010300031601 | journal = Millennium&amp;nbsp;– Journal of International Studies | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 625–626 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Collier has said that the Culture is a utopia carrying significantly greater moral legitimacy than the West's, by comparison, proto-democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bencollier.info/content/becoming-more-culture-no-1-economics-v01 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722165135/http://www.bencollier.info/content/becoming-more-culture-no-1-economics-v01 |archivedate=22 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Culture interventions can seem similar at first to Western interventions, especially when considered with their democratising rhetoric, the argument is that the Culture operates completely without material need, and therefore without the possibility of baser motives. This is not to say that the Culture's motives are purely altruistic; a peaceful, enlightened universe full of good neighbours lacking ethnic, religious, and sexual chauvinisms is in the Culture's interest as well. Furthermore, the Culture's ideals (in many ways similar to those of the liberal perspective today&lt;ref name="Brown-2001-SCLIB"/&gt;) are to a much larger extent realised internally in comparison to the West.

===Criticism===
Examples are the use of mercenaries to perform the work that the Culture does not want to get their hands dirty with, and even outright threats of invasion (the Culture has issued ultimatums to other civilizations before). Some commentators have also argued that those Special Circumstances agents tasked with civilising foreign cultures (and thus potentially also changing them into a blander, more Culture-like state) are also those most likely to regret these changes, with parallels drawn to real-world special forces trained to operate within the cultural mindsets of foreign nations.&lt;ref name="Brown-2001-SCLIB"/&gt;

The events of ''Use of Weapons'' are an example of just how dirty Special Circumstances will play in order to get their way and the conspiracy at the heart of the plot of ''Excession'' demonstrates how at least some Minds are prepared to risk killing sentient beings when they conclude that these actions are beneficial for the long term good. Special Circumstances represents a very small fraction of Contact, which itself is only a small fraction of the entire Culture, making it comparable again to size and influence of modern [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] agencies.

==Issues raised==
The Culture stories are largely about problems and paradoxes that confront [[Liberalism|liberal societies]]. The Culture itself is an "ideal-typical" liberal society; that is, as pure an example as one can reasonably imagine. It is highly [[egalitarian]]; the liberty of the individual is its most important value; and all actions and decisions are expected to be determined according to a standard of reasonability and sociability inculcated into all people through a progressive system of education. It is a society so beyond material scarcity that for almost all practical purposes its people can have and do what they want. If they do not like the behavior or opinions of others, they can easily move to a more congenial Culture population centre (or Culture subgroup), and hence there is little need to enforce codes of behavior.&lt;ref name="JacksonHeilman2008OutsideContextProblems"/&gt;

Even the Culture has to compromise its ideals where diplomacy and its own security are concerned. Contact, the group that handles these issues, and Special Circumstances, its secret service division, can employ only those on whose talents and emotional stability it can rely, and may even reject self-aware drones built for its purposes that fail to meet its requirements. Hence these divisions are regarded as the Culture's elite and membership is widely regarded as a prize; yet also something that can be shameful as it contradicts many of the Culture's moral codes.

Within Contact and Special Circumstances, there are also inner circles that can take control in crises, somewhat contradictory to the ideal notions of democratic and open process the Culture espouses. Contact and Special Circumstances may suppress or delay the release of information, for example to avoid creating public pressure for actions they consider imprudent or to prevent other civilizations from exploiting certain situations.&lt;ref name="JacksonHeilman2008OutsideContextProblems" /&gt;

In dealing with less powerful regressive civilizations, the Culture usually intervenes discreetly, for example by protecting and discreetly supporting the more liberal elements, or subverting illiberal institutions. For instance, in ''Use of Weapons'', the Culture operates within a less advanced illiberal society through control of a business cartel which is known for its humanitarian and social development investments, as well as generic good Samaritanism. In ''Excession'', a sub-group of Minds conspires to provoke a war with the extremely sadistic Affront, although the conspiracy is foiled by a [[General Systems Vehicle|GSV]] that is a deep cover Special Circumstances agent.  Only one story, ''Consider Phlebas'', pits the Culture against a highly illiberal society of approximately equal power: the aggressive, [[theocratic]] [[Idiran]]s. Though they posed no immediate, direct threat to the Culture, the Culture declared war because it would have felt useless if it allowed the Idirans' ruthless expansion to continue. The Culture's decision was a value-judgement rather than a [[utilitarian]] calculation, and the "Peace Faction" within the Culture [[secede]]d.&lt;ref name="JacksonHeilman2008OutsideContextProblems" /&gt; Later in the timeline of the Culture's universe, the Culture has reached a technological level at which most past civilizations have [[The Sublimed|Sublimed]], in other words disengaged from Galactic politics and from most physical interaction with other civilizations. The Culture continues to behave "like an idealistic adolescent".&lt;ref name="JacksonHeilman2008OutsideContextProblems" /&gt;

As of 2008, three stories force the Culture to consider its approach to more powerful civilizations. In one incident during the [[Culture-Idiran War]], they strive to avoid offending a civilization so advanced that it has disengaged from Galactic politics, and note that this hyper-advanced society is not a threat to either the welfare or the values of the Culture.&lt;ref&gt;Consider Phlebas&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Excession'', an overwhelmingly more powerful individual from an extremely advanced civilization is simply passing through on its way from one plane of the physical Reality to another, and there is no real interaction. In the third case it sets up teams to study a civilization that is not threatening but is thought to have eliminated aggressors in the past.&lt;ref name="JacksonHeilman2008OutsideContextProblems" /&gt;

==Banks on the Culture==
When asked in ''Wired'' magazine (June 1996) whether mankind's fate depends on having intelligent machines running things, as in the Culture, Banks replied:

{{quote|Not entirely, no. I think the first point to make about the Culture is, I'm just making it up as I go along. It doesn't exist and I don't delude myself that it does. It's just my take on it. I'm not convinced that humanity is capable of becoming the Culture because I think people in the Culture are just too nice&amp;nbsp;– altering their genetic inheritance to make themselves relatively sane and rational and not the genocidal, murdering bastards that we seem to be half the time.}}

{{quote|But I don't think you have to have a society like the Culture in order for people to live. The Culture is a self-consciously stable and long-lived society that wants to go on living for thousands of years. Lots of other civilizations within the same universe hit the Culture's technological level and even the actuality of the Culture's utopia, but it doesn't last very long&amp;nbsp;– that's the difference.}}

{{quote|The point is, humanity can find its own salvation. It doesn't necessarily have to rely on machines. It'll be a bit sad if we did, if it's our only real form of progress. Nevertheless, unless there's some form of catastrophe, we are going to use machines whether we like it or not. This sort of stuff has been going on for decades and mainstream society is beginning to catch up to the implications of artificial intelligence.}}

In a 2002 interview with ''[[Science Fiction Weekly]]'' magazine, when asked:
{{quote|''[[Excession]]'' is particularly popular because of its copious detail concerning the Ships and Minds of the Culture, its great AIs: their outrageous names, their dangerous senses of humour. Is this what gods would actually be like?}}

Banks replied:
{{quote|If we're lucky.}}

'''''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''''' first published in 1932, edited by the retired diplomat [[Paul Harvey (diplomat)|Sir Paul Harvey]] (1869–1948), was the earliest of the [[Oxford Companions]] to appear.  It is currently in its seventh edition (2009), edited by [[Dinah Birch]].  The work, which has been periodically updated, includes biographies of prominent historical and leading contemporary writers in the English language, entries on major works, "allusions which may be encountered", significant ([[Serial (literature)|serial]]) publications and literary clubs. Writers in other languages are included when they have affected the anglophone world.  The ''Companion'' achieved "classic status" with the expanded fifth edition edited by novelist and scholar [[Margaret Drabble]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/6508888/The-Oxford-Companion-to-English-Literature-ed-by-Dinah-Birch-review.html|title = The Oxford Companion to English Literature ed by Dinah Birch: review|last = Rahim|first = By Sameer|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book was often referred to as "The Drabble".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/rivalries/2013/08/literary_grudge_match_a_s_byatt_margaret_drabble_their_mother_and_their.html|title = “A Narrative of Jealousy and Bafflement and Resentment”|last = Waldman|first = Katy|date = 2013-08-19|newspaper = Slate|language = en-US|issn = 1091-2339|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Harvey's entries concerning Sir [[Walter Scott]], much admired by Drabble in the introduction to the fifth edition, had to be reduced for reasons of space, in the sixth edition. 

Modern technology has meant that the two most recent editions have been updated at intervals of about five years before more radical changes are made; a revised printing of the sixth edition was published in 2006. The revised 2000 edition is now available in the Oxford Reference Online series - by subscription only  [http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/Subjects_and_titles__t113]
