      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3532">'''Abdilatif Abdalla''' (born 1946 in [[Mombasa]]) is a [[Kenya]]n writer and political activist. He was imprisoned for his support of the [[Kenya People's Union]], and wrote the poems collected in ''Sauti ya Dhiki'' while in solitary confinement, which were subsequently awarded the [[Jomo Kenyatta Prize for Literature]]. 

==Early life==
Abdilatif Abdalla was born in [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]], in 1946, where he was brought up by his grandfather Ahmad Basheikh bin Hussein. Abdalla attended school in [[Faza]], before undertaking further studies at the British Tutorial College. He began his political involvement after working for the Mombasa City Council as an assistant accountant, writing the pamphlet ''Kenya Twendapi?'' (Eng: ''Kenya, Where Are We Headed'') in support of the [[Kenya People's Union]] in 1968.{{sfn |Akyeampong|Gates| 2012| pp=17-18}}&lt;ref name="Pambazuka"&gt;{{cite news|last1=wa Wanjiru|first1=Kimani|title=Abdilatif Abdalla: 'My poems gave me company'|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/arts/abdilatif-abdalla-my-poems-gave-me-company|accessdate=20 October 2016|work=Pambazuka News|date=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political imprisonment and writing==
When the Kenyan Government of [[Jomo Kenyatta]] conducted a crackdown on KPU activists, Abdalla was imprisoned for conspiracy between 1969 and 1972. He was at first held in [[Kaliti Prison]], and later in [[Shimo la Tewa Prison]], where he was kept in solitary confinement. It was while imprisoned that he wrote the poems that would be collected in the 1973 work ''Sauti ya Dhiki''. These were written in the Mombasa version of the [[Swahili language]].{{sfn |Akyeampong|Gates| 2012| pp=17-18}} He later explained that writing the poems in solitary confinement had kept him sane.&lt;ref name="Pambazuka"/&gt;

After he was awarded the [[Jomo Kenyatta Prize for Literature]] for ''Sauti ya Dhiki'' in 1972, he moved in exile to [[Tanzania]]. While there he worked as a senior researcher on Swahili at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]] and collaborated editing a Swahili dictionary. In 1979, he moved to London and worked for [[BBC]] Swahili department, later editing the news magazine ''Africa Events''. Abdalla's only [[English language]] poem was published in 1988, entitled ''Peace, Love and Unity for Whom?''. This was in response to an attempt by [[Daniel arap Moi]]'s government to bribe Abdalla into no longer working with [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]]. Abdalla has since taught Swahili at [[Leipzig University]].{{sfn |Akyeampong|Gates| 2012| pp=17-18}}

Such views shape one's worldview and one's moral, political convictions.

| quote       = Surveys say about nine out of 10 Americans believe in God, but the way we picture that God reveals our attitudes on economics, justice, social morality, war, natural disasters, science, politics, love and more, say Paul Froese and Christopher Bader, sociologists at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. Their new book, America's Four Gods: What We Say About God — And What That Says About Us, examines our diverse visions of the Almighty and why they matter.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The four different conceptions of God described in the book are the ''authoritative God'', the ''benevolent God'', the ''critical God'' and the ''distant God''.&lt;ref name=ChristianityToday2010-11-15&gt;

| quote       = Respondents' answers lead the authors to identify four conceptions of God among the American religious public: (1) the authoritative God, who both judges and is closely engaged in the world; (2) the benevolent God, who is "engaged but nonjudgmental"; (3) the critical God, who happens to be judgmental but disengaged; and (4) the distant God, who is neither engaged nor judgmental, and {{sic|could}} care less about how humans muck about.
| page        =
| author      = Matthew Lee Anderson
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who conceive of an authoritative God and a benevolent God both see God as taking an interventionist role in believers lives.
They differ, however, in how they see God intervening.&lt;ref name=ChristianityToday2010-11-15/&gt;
Those who conceive of an authoritative God imagine God intervenes to punish those who lapse from his rules, and are likely to be white males.
Those who conceive of a benevolent God imagine God intervenes to rescue and present alternatives, and are likely to be female.

Individuals who conceive of a critical God imagine he does not intervene in individuals lives, but will judge them in an afterlife. Statistically black Americans are more likely to hold this conception.&lt;ref name=ChristianityToday2010-11-15/&gt;

Those who believe in a distant God imagine that God set the entire Universe in motion, but has no engagement with humanity at all.&lt;ref name=ChristianityToday2010-11-15/&gt;
Americans who hold this conception are statistically likely to have completed more years of education than those in the other three groups.

Father [[Patrick J. Howell]], a Jesuit writing in ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', noted that the four conceptions of God where represented by followers of [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]] and [[Islam]].&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes2010-10-22/&gt;
Howell wrote:
{{quotation|Some would have us believe, Froese and Bader argue, that American society is engaged in a titanic struggle between "true believers" and the "godless." But the two authors note that only 5 percent are atheists, and they identify four, mostly contradictory, views of God as the source for the intractable social and political divisions among Americans.}}

'''Art in Medieval Scotland''' includes all forms of [[Scottish art|artistic production]] within the modern borders of Scotland, between the fifth century and the adoption of the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]] in the early sixteenth century. In the [[early Middle Ages]], there were distinct material cultures evident in the different federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. [[Pictish art]] was the only uniquely Scottish Medieval style; it can be seen in the extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns. It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hoards. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] suggests that it was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed.

[[Insular art]] is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland from the eighth century and which became highly influential in continental Europe and contributed to the development of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones, in the heavily carved [[high cross]]es found particularly in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the [[Book of Kells]], which may have been begun, or wholly created at the monastic centre of [[Iona]].

Scotland adopted the Romanesque style relatively late and retained and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors. From the thirteenth century there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies. Native craftsmanship can be seen in a variety of items. Visual illustration can be seen in the illumination of charters and occasional survivals of church paintings. Surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude, but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent, particularly the Netherlands.

[[File:DunnichenMeffan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Dunnichen Stone]], a Class I incised stone, with [[Double disc (Pictish symbol)|double disc and z-rod]], [[Mirror and comb (Pictish symbol)|mirror and comb]] and flower Pictish symbols]]
About 250 Pictish stones survive and have been assigned by scholars to three classes.&lt;ref&gt;J. N. G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), {{ISBN|0748602917}}, pp. 161–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the seventh century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals such as fish and the [[Pictish beast]], everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the [[Firth of Forth]] to [[Shetland]]. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the [[Dunrobin Castle|Dunrobin]] (Sutherland) and [[Aberlemno]] stones ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]).&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8&gt;[[James Graham-Campbell|J. Graham-Campbell]] and C. E. Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and a wide range of symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include [[Glamis]] 2, which contains a finely executed [[Celtic cross]] on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt; Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt; Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt;

===Pictish metalwork===
Items of metalwork have been found throughout Pictland. The earlier Picts appear to have had a considerable amount of silver available, probably from raiding further south, or the payment of subsidies to keep them from doing so. The very large hoard of late Roman [[hacksilver]] found at [[Traprain Law]] may have originated in either way. The largest hoard of early Pictish metalwork was found in 1819 at Norrie's Law in Fife, but unfortunately much was dispersed and melted down.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp26-8&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th–9th centuries AD'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 26–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Over ten heavy silver chains, some over {{convert|0.5|m|ft}} long, have been found from this period; the double-linked [[Whitecleuch Chain]] is one of only two that have a penannular ring, with symbol decoration including enamel, which shows how these were probably used as "choker" necklaces.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp26-8/&gt; The [[St Ninian's Isle]] Treasure of 28 silver and silver-gilt objects, contains perhaps the best collection of late Pictish forms, from the Christian period, when Pictish metalwork style, as with stone-carving, gradually merged with Insular, Anglo-Saxon and Viking styles.&lt;ref&gt;L. R. Laing, ''Later Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland'' (London: Osprey Publishing, 1987), {{ISBN|0852638744}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish-Scots art===

[[File:Hunterston BroochDSCF6363.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The front of the [[Hunterston Brooch]], found near [[Hunterston]], [[North Ayrshire]], which shows Irish elements of style and may have been made in the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]]]]
[[Thomas Charles-Edwards]] has suggested that the kingdom of Dál Riata was a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland, with which the Scots settlers in what is now Argyll kept close contacts. This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd, which combine Pictish and Irish elements.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0521363950}}, pp. 331–2.&lt;/ref&gt; This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the seventh century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the [[Hunterston brooch]], found in Ayrshire, which may have been made in Dál Riata, but with elements that suggest Irish origins. These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration (or pressblech), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which Dál Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed.&lt;ref name=Lane2001&gt;A. Lane, [http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba62/feat1.shtml "Citadel of the first Scots"], ''British Archaeology'', 62, December 2001. Retrieved 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighth and ninth centuries the Pictish elite adopted true penannular [[brooch]]es with lobed terminals from Ireland. Some older Irish [[pseudo-penannular]] brooches were adapted to the Pictish style, for example the Breadalbane Brooch (British Museum). The eighth century [[Monymusk Reliquary]] has elements of Pictish and Irish style.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp109-1123&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th–9th centuries AD'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 109–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Anglo-Saxon art===
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon art}}
Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art are largely metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone [[Franks Casket]], thought to have been produced in [[Northumbria]] in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reginald Dodwell|C. R. Dodwell]], ''Anglo-Saxon Art: A New Perspective'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1982), {{ISBN|071900926X}}, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one known pagan burial in Scotland, at [[Dalmeny]] Midlothian, which contains a necklace of beads similar to those found in mid-seventh-century southern England. Other isolated finds include a gold object from Dalmeny, shaped like a truncated pyramid, with [[filigree]] and [[garnet]], similar to sword harness mounts found at [[Sutton Hoo]]. There is also a bun-shaped loom from [[Yetholm]], Roxburghshire and a ring with an Anglian [[runes|runic]] inscription. From eastern Scotland there is a seventh-century sword [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]] from [[Culbin Sands]], Moray and the [[Burghead]] drinking horn mount.&lt;ref&gt;L. Laing, ''The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland C. 400–1200 AD'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1975), {{ISBN|0416823602}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Christianisation of Scotland|Christianisation]] in the seventh century artistic styles in Northumbria, which then reached to the Firth of Forth, interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;C. E Karkov, ''The Art of Anglo-Saxon England'' (Boydell Press, 2011), {{ISBN|1843836289}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insular art===
{{Main|Insular art}}
[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The opening page from the [[Gospel of John]] from the [[Book of Kells]], usually thought to have been made in [[Iona]].]]
Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art, is the name given to the common style produced in Scotland, Britain and Anglo-Saxon England from the seventh century, with the combining of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon forms.&lt;ref&gt;H. Honour and J. Fleming, ''A World History of Art'' (London: Macmillan), {{ISBN|0333371852}}, pp. 244–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving examples of Insular art are found in metalwork, carving, but mainly in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. In manuscripts surfaces are highly decorated with intricate patterning, with no attempt to give an impression of depth, volume or recession. The best examples include the [[Book of Kells]], which may have been wholly or partly created in Iona, and the [[Book of Durrow]], which may be from Ireland or Northumbria. [[Carpet pages]] are a characteristic feature of Insular manuscripts, although [[historiated initial]]s (an Insular invention), [[canon table]]s and figurative miniatures, especially [[Evangelist portrait]]s, are also common. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the Viking raids in the late eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Dodwell, ''The Pictorial Arts of the West, 800–1200'' (Yale UP, 1993), {{ISBN|0300064934}}, pp. 85 and 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity discouraged the burial of grave goods so the majority of examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Dodwell, ''Anglo-Saxon Art, a New Perspective''  (Manchester:Manchester University Press, 1982), {{ISBN|071900926X}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few exceptions, notably portable [[shrine]]s ("[[cumdach]]s") for books or [[relic]]s, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the [[Monymusk Reliquary]] has always been in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 134–140.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops.&lt;ref&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with [[amber]] and [[rock crystal]] among the commonest, and some [[garnet]]s. Coloured glass, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[millefiori]] glass, probably imported, are also used.&lt;ref&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 72–115, and 170–174 and D. M. Wilson, ''Anglo-Saxon Art: From The Seventh Century To The Norman Conquest'' (Overlook Press, 1984), pp. 113–114 and 120–130.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Calkins, ''Illuminated Books of the Middle Ages'' (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press 1983), pp. 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monymusk ReliquaryDSCF6383.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Monymusk Reliquary]], made c. 750]]
The most significant survivals in sculpture are in [[High cross]]es, large free-standing stone crosses, usually carved in relief with patterns, biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions. The tradition may have begun in Ireland or Anglo-Saxon England and then spread to Scotland.&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19&gt;J. T. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1–5'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), {{ISBN|1851094407}}, pp. 915–19.&lt;/ref&gt; They are found throughout the British Isles and often feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a [[Celtic cross]], apparently an innovation of Celtic Christianity, that may have begun at [[Iona]].&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Wilson, ''Anglo-Saxon Art: From The Seventh Century To The Norman Conquest'' (Overlook Press), 1984, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution in Scotland is heaviest in the Highlands and Islands and they can be dated to the period c. 750 to 1150.&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19/&gt; All the surviving crosses are of stone, but there are indications that large numbers of wooden crosses may also have existed. In Scotland biblical iconography is less common than in Ireland, but the subject of [[King David]] is relatively frequently depicted. In the east the influence of Pictish sculpture can be seen, in areas of Viking occupation and settlement, crosses for the tenth to the twelfth centuries have distinctive Scandinavian patterns, often mixed with native styles. Important examples dated to the eighth century include St Martin's Cross on Iona, the [[Kildalton Cross]] from the Hebrides and the Anglo-Saxon [[Ruthwell Cross]].&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19/&gt; Through the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] to the continent, insular art was highly influential on subsequent European Medieval art, especially the decorative elements of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;G. Henderson, ''Early Medieval Art'' (London: Penguin, 1972), pp. 63–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viking age art===
{{See also|Viking Age art}}
[[File:UigChessmen SelectionOfKings.jpg|thumb|Some of the [[Lewis chessmen]]]]
Viking art avoided naturalism, favouring stylised animal motifs to create its ornamental patterns. Ribbon-interlace was important and plant motifs became fashionable in the tenth and eleventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Scottish artefacts come from 130 "pagan" burials in the north and west from the mid-ninth to the mid-tenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carver, ''The Cross Goes North: Processes of Conversion in Northern Europe, AD 300–1300'' (Boydell Press, 2006), {{ISBN|1843831252}}, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; These include jewellery, weapons and occasional elaborate high status items.&lt;ref&gt;J. Jesch, ''Women in the Viking Age'' (Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1991), {{ISBN|0851153607}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the most impressive of these is the [[Scar boat burial]], on Orkney, which contained an elaborate sword, quiver with arrows, a brooch, bone comb, gaming pieces and the Scar Dragon Plaque, made from whalebone, most of which were probably made in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;K. Holman, ''The Northern [I. E. Northern] Conquest: Vikings in Britain and Ireland'' (Signal Books, 2007), {{ISBN|1904955347}}, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; From the west, another boat burial at Kiloron Bay in [[Colonsay]] revealed a sword, shield, iron cauldron and enamelled scales, which may be Celtic in origin.&lt;ref&gt;L. Laing, ''The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland C. 400–1200 AD'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1975), {{ISBN|0416823602}}, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of Viking and Celtic styles can be see in a [[penannular brooch]] from Pierowall in Orkney, which has a Pictish-style looped pin. It is about two inches in diameter, with traces of gilding, and probably housed a piece of amber surrounded by interweaving ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;W. Nolan, L. Ronayne and M. Dunlevy, eds, ''Donegal: History &amp; Society: Interdisciplinary Essays on the History of an Irish County'' (Geography, 1995), {{ISBN|0906602459}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; After the conversion to Christianity, from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, stone crosses and cross-slabs in Viking occupied areas of the Highlands and Islands were carved with successive styles of Viking ornament.&lt;ref&gt;J. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: Aberdeen Breviary-Celticism'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), {{ISBN|1851094407}}. p. 918.&lt;/ref&gt; They were frequently mixed with native interlace and animal patterns. Examples include the eleventh-century cross-slab from Dóid Mhàiri on the island of [[Islay]], where the plant motifs on either side of the cross-shaft are based upon the [[Ringerike style]] of Viking art.&lt;ref&gt;J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey. ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous artistic find from modern Scotland, the [[Lewis Chessmen]], from [[Uig, Lewis|Uig]], were probably made in [[Trondheim]] in Norway, but contain some decoration that may have been influenced by Celtic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;M.

Architectural evidence suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked in much of Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland in the second half of the twelfth century&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Swanson, ''The Twelfth-Century Renaissance'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0719042569}}, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the [[English Gothic architecture|English perpendicular]] style that had come to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0191624330}}, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, for the end of the period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt;

The interiors of churches were often more elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell.&lt;ref name=Whyte&amp;Whyte1991p117&gt;I. D. Whyte and K. A.

H. Rigby, ''A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages'' (London: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), {{ISBN|0631217851}}, p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt; Monumental effigies began to appear in churches from the thirteenth century and they were usually fully coloured and gilded. Many were founders and patrons of churches and chapels, including members of the clergy, knights and often their wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to brass etchings, they continued to be produced until the end of the Medieval period, with the largest group dating from the fifteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;R. Brydall, ''The Monumental Effigies of Scotland: From the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Century'' (Kessinger Publishing, 1895, rpt. 2010) {{ISBN|1169232329}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.

Common motifs were ships, swords, harps and Romanesque vine leaf tracery with Celtic elements.&lt;ref&gt;M.

===Decorative arts===
{{Main|Sculpture in Scotland}}
[[File:Financrozier2.jpg|thumb|upright|The 12th century "Loch Shiel Crozier Drop", hollow for a relic, with the bust of a king.&lt;ref&gt;V. Glenn, ''Romanesque and Gothic: Decorative Metalwork and Ivory Carvings in the Museum of Scotland'' (National Museums of Scotland, 2003), {{ISBN|1901663558}}, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Survivals from late Medieval church fittings and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even compared to those from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the [[Scottish Reformation]]. The Scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as [[Limoges enamel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 1–4; Chapter III on enamels&lt;/ref&gt; It is often difficult to decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.

Two secular small chests with carved whalebone panels and metal fittings illustrate some aspects of the Scottish arts. The Eglington and Fife Caskets are very similar and were probably made by the same workshop around 1500, as boxes for valuables such as jewellery or documents. The overall form of the caskets follows French examples, and the locks and metal bands are decorated in Gothic style with "simple decorations of [[fleuron (architectural)|fleuron]]s and debased [[egg and dart]]" while the whalebone panels are carved in [[relief]] with a late form of Insular interwoven [[strapwork]] characteristic of late Medieval West Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 147, 186–191; both now [[Museum of Scotland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Key examples of native craftsmanship on items include the [[Bute mazer]], the earliest surviving drinking cup of its type, made of maple-wood and with elaborate silver-gilt ornamentation, dated to around 1320.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 34–38, and 16th century cover, 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; The Savernake Horn was probably made for the earl of Moray in the fourteenth century and looted by the English in the mid-sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9&gt;B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0333567617}}, pp. 127–9.&lt;/ref&gt; A few significant [[reliquaries]] survive from West Scotland, examples of the habit of the [[Celtic church]] of treating the possessions rather than the bones of saints as [[relic]]s. As in Irish examples these were partly reworked and elaborated at intervals over a long period. These are St Fillan's Crozier and its "Coigreach" or [[reliquary]], between them with elements from each century from the eleventh to the fifteenth, the [[Guthrie, Angus|Guthrie]] Bell Shrine, Iona, twelfth to fifteenth century, and the Kilmichael Glassary Bell Shrine, Argyll, mid-twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 92–115, all Museum of Scotland; MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Skye Chess piece is a single elaborate piece in carved [[walrus]] ivory, with two warriors carrying heraldic shields in a framework of openwork vegetation. It is thought to be Scottish, of the mid-thirteenth century, with aspects similar to both English and Norwegian pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 146–147, 178–181; now Museum of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest groups of surviving works of art are the seal matrices that appear to have entered Scottish usage with feudalism in the reign of David I, beginning at the royal court and among his Anglo-Norman vassals and then by about 1250 they began to spread to the [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] areas of the country. They would be made compulsory for barons of the king in a statute of 1401&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 116–144; C. J. Neville, ''Land, Law and People in Medieval Scotland'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748639586}}, pp. 83–99.&lt;/ref&gt; and seal matrices show very high standards of skill and artistry.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; Examples of items that were probably the work of continental artists include the delicate hanging lamp in St. John's Kirk in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], the vestments and hangings in Holyrood&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; and the Medieval maces of the Universities of [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and [[Glasgow university|Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt;

===Illumination and painting===

Manuscript illumination continued into the late Middle Ages, moving from elaborate gospels to charters, like that confirming the rights of [[Kelso Abbey]] from 1159.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brydall, ''Art in Scotland: its Origins and Progress'' (Edinburgh and London: Blackwood, 1889), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Very little painting from Scottish churches survives. There is only one surviving [[Doom painting]] in Scotland, at [[Guthrie, Angus|Guthrie]] near [[Arbroath]], which may have been painted by the same artist as the elaborate crucifixion and other paintings at Foulis Easter, eighteen miles away.&lt;ref&gt;M.

'''Besharmi Morcha''', also known as "Slutwalk arthaat Besharmi Morcha", is the Indian equivalent of [[SlutWalk]]. This was an organization started in 2011 by Canadian women who protested Toronto's police public statements suggesting that women could avoid rape and sexual assault by the way they dressed.&lt;ref name="Sarah Bell uk-13739876"&gt;{{cite news| last=   Bell| first=  Sarah| url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13739876| title=  Slutwalk London: 'Yes means yes and no means no'| work=  [[BBC News]]| date=  June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SlutWalk homepage"&gt;{{cite web| url=  http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/| title=  homepage| publisher=  SlutWalk Toronto| accessdate = May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have conducted events across the world for education about this issue.

==Translation==

Besharmi Morcha ({{lang-hi|बेशर्मी मोर्चा}}) is most often translated into English as "shameless protest" or "shameless front". It has also been translated as “March of the Shameless”&lt;ref name="Reuters001"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/07/31/idINIndia-58547420110731 |title=Hundreds protest rape in conservative India’s toned down "SlutWalk" |work=Reuters India |date=31 July 2011 |agency=TrustLaw – Thomson Reuters Foundation |author=Bhalla, Nita |location=Delhi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68F8MBUbf?url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/07/31/idINIndia-58547420110731 |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Shameless Campaign".&lt;ref name="SouthAsiaDaily001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southasia.typepad.com/south_asia_daily/2011/07/the-not-at-all-slutty-slut-walk-of-bhopal.html |title=The not-at-all slutty Slut Walk of Bhopal |publisher=[[Mayank Chhaya]] |work=Blog: South Asia Daily |date=21 July 2011 |author=Chhaya, Mayank |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68GrcXhWq?url=http://southasia.typepad.com/south_asia_daily/2011/07/the-not-at-all-slutty-slut-walk-of-bhopal.html |archivedate=8 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besharmi Morcha was chosen as the name in India to address its diverse cultural aspects and languages.&lt;ref name="NameChange001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rememberoursisterseverywhere.com/events/slutwalk-new-delhi |title=Besharmi Morcha, "Shameless Protest" |publisher=rememberoursisterseverywhere.com |date=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68F9NV5vc?url=http://www.rememberoursisterseverywhere.com/events/slutwalk-new-delhi |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NameChange002"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.oneindia.in/2011/06/18/no-slutwalk-in-delhi-as-besharmi-morcha-takes-over-aid0120.html | title=No 'SlutWalk' in Delhi as 'Besharmi Morcha' takes over | work=OneIndia News | agency=Greynium Information Technologies Pvt.

The word "[[slut]]" does not translate directly or equivalently into Indian languages such as Hindi. The nearest equivalent direct translation of slut is ''ranɖii'' ({{lang-hi|रंडी}})&lt;ref name="RandiTrans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/hindi-english/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%80 |title=Hindi-English translation for "रंडी" |publisher=bab.la |work=bab.la Dictionary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Dld0hS8?url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/hindi-english/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%80 |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "prostitute".&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/world/asia/15iht-letter15.html?_r=1 |title=Ready or Not, New Delhi Gets a Women’s Street Protest |work=New York Times |date=14 June 2011 |agency=The New York Times Company |author=NILANJANA S.

Besharmi ({{lang-hi|बेशर्मी}}) translates as shamelessly, brazenly and even boldly. It may imply a quality of obscenity or obscenely.&lt;ref name="BesharmiTrans001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/shabdkosh.php?word=%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%80 |title=Get Meaning of besharmi in English. बेशर्मी का मतलब अंग्रेजी में जानिए |publisher=HinKhoj InfoLabs LLP |work=hinkhoj.com Hindi to English dictionary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DpH6jjP?url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/shabdkosh.php?word=%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%80 |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morcha ({{lang-hi|मोर्चा}}) is closely linked to the idea of protest and action. It often indicates political protest and has military overtones.&lt;ref name="MorchaDictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/words/meaning-of-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE-in-english.html |title=Get Meaning of morcha in English. मोर्चा का मतलब अंग्रेजी में जानिए |publisher=HinKhoj InfoLabs LLP |work=hinkhoj.com Hindi to English dictionary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DkyWkx2?url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/words/meaning-of-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE-in-english.html |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MorchaDictionary2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/hindi-english/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE |title=Hindi-English translation for "मोर्चा" |publisher=bab.la |work=bab.la Dictionary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Dm01u3N?url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/hindi-english/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besharmi Morcha has multiple meanings that are not readily translated into English. It is generally summed up as meaning "shamelessly and boldly protesting in a united way that others may see as wrong or even obscene".

'''Blackwell UK''', also known as '''Blackwell's''' and '''Blackwell Group''', is a British [[Academic publishing|academic]] [[bookselling|book]] retailer and library supply service. It was founded in 1879 by [[Benjamin Henry Blackwell]],&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; after whom the chain is named, in [[Oxford]] on [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]]. The firm now has a chain of 45 shops, and an accounts and library supply service. It employs around 1000 staff in its divisions.&lt;ref name="Staff ownership"&gt;{{cite news|last=Finch|first=Julia|title=Blackwell book chain owner plans to hand firm over to staff|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/08/blackwells-bookstores-staff-ownership-switch|accessdate=27 January 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="library jobs cut"&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Lisa|title=Blackwell cuts 19 from library supply business|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/blackwell-cuts-19-library-supply-business.html|accessdate=27 January 2012|newspaper=The Bookseller|date=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Blackwell's Bookshop and White Horse, Broad Street Oxford, September 1977.jpg|thumb|The main store in Oxford in 1977]]
The company was founded in 1879 by [[Benjamin Henry Blackwell]], son of the first city librarian, who having finished his education at 13, was apprenticed to a local bookseller for a [[£sd|shilling]] a week. His father, Benjamin Harris Blackwell, had been heavily involved in the [[Temperance movement|Temperance Society]]. The society promoted, as well as religion, self-education and also encouraged reading. The society provided separate rooms for non-alcoholic refreshment and silent reading. A religious family, the Blackwells had also become involved with the Temperance Society due to Benjamin's father being [[teetotal]], and as a protest against the government making money from the [[excise duty]] on alcohol.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=48 – 51 Broad Street, Oxford|url=http://www.headington.org.uk/oxon/broad/buildings/north/48,49,50,51.htm|work=Broad Street Oxford|publisher=Headington|accessdate=27 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702063215/http://headington.org.uk/oxon/broad/buildings/north/48%2C49%2C50%2C51.htm|archivedate=2 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flagship shop at 48–51 [[Broad Street, Oxford]], was originally only twelve feet square but quickly grew to incorporate the upstairs, cellar and neighbouring shops. Benjamin Henry Blackwell was well respected in Oxford and was elected the first [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] councillor for Oxford North.

[[Basil Blackwell]], Benjamin Henry's son, became the first Blackwell to go to university; he was awarded a scholarship at [[Oxford University]]'s [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]]. He was expected to join the family firm, however, which he did in 1913, after a spell as an apprentice publisher in London. He was tasked with expanding his father's publishing business. 
[[File:Norrington room.jpg|thumb|left|The "Norrington Room", contains more than 160,000 books on 3+ miles of shelving]]
The first Blackwell publication, ''Mensæ Secundæ: verses written in [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]]'' by [[H.C. Beeching]], was printed in 1897. Blackwell's began the careers of many writers: [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s first poem, "Goblin's Feet", was published in 1915.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; To promote universal access to literature, Blackwell's pioneered a series of cheaper books, from a one-volume [[Shakespeare]] to "[[£sd|3-and-6]] novels". The publishing company was merged into the main company in 1921, and a scientific section was added in 1939.

When Benjamin Henry died in 1924, Basil Blackwell took over from his father, and went on to head the company for over sixty years. Basil Blackwell also wanted to preserve fine printing. After rescuing the Shakespeare Head Press, he commissioned [[belles-lettres]], including well-known classics such as the [[Pilgrim's Progress]], the works of the [[Brontë]]s and a complete version of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]].

In 1966, the Norrington Room was opened, named after [[Arthur Lionel Pugh Norrington|Sir Arthur Norrington]], the President of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]] and extending under part of Trinity College. It boasts three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) of shelving and at {{convert|10000|sqft|m2}} merited an entry in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the largest single room selling books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Guinness Book of Records|year=1967|publisher=Guinness Superlatives Limited|location=London|isbn=0-900424-00-1|page=123|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
The company has followed a determined policy since the 1990s to spread out from its traditional Oxford base and take on a much broader UK presence.

In 1995, Blackwell's became the first bookshop in the UK to allow its customers to purchase online from a catalogue of over 150,000 titles, and opened a flagship shop in London the same year, at 100 [[Charing Cross Road]], which is now one of the company's six most prominent shops.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Blackwell's took over the Heffers bookshops in [[Cambridge]] in 1999, and in 2002 acquired the academic bookshops of [[James Thin]] in Scotland.

Blackwell's now has over 60 retail outlets across the UK, including a number of medical and other specialist bookshops, and even a shop in [[Aberdeen]] specialising in the [[oil industry]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Both the Oxford and London flagship shops have won Bookseller of the Year at the [[British Book Awards]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The company is still in the hands of the Blackwell family. Support for its activities, including Blackwell's Online, is based at Beaver House in Oxford.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The company was to be partially funded by Toby Blackwell Limited in 2012.&lt;ref name="Blackwell results 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Lisa|title=Revenue drops but losses down at Blackwell|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/revenue-drops-losses-down-blackwell.html|accessdate=16 April 2012|newspaper=The Bookseller|date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
Blackwell's maintains over 40 retail outlets across the UK, with flagship stores located in [[Oxford]], [[Cambridge]], [[South Bridge, Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] and [[High Holborn|London]]. Other branches are located on university campuses or are specialist branches, focusing on Music and Art.

'''Charles Bagot Cayley''' (1823–1883) was an English [[linguistics|linguist]], best known for translating [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] into the metre of the original, with annotations. He also made metrical versions of the ''[[Iliad]]'', the ''[[Prometheus]]'' of [[Aeschylus|Æschylus]], the ''[[Canzoniere]]'' of [[Petrarch]].

The translations from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] are a laboured attempt to mirror the versification rules of the originals. His version of ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' is much more successful, preserving the Dante's ''[[terza rima]]'' rhyme scheme while using a relatively simple English which reflects Dante's own use of ordinary [[Italian language|Italian]]. Charles Bagot Cayley also published a collection of his own poems, ''Psyche's Interludes''.

From Mr Pollecary's school, Blackheath, Charles Cayley went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1845 with a BA in the classical tripos.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CLY841CB|name=Cayley, Charles Bagot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied at [[King's College London]], under [[Gabriele Rossetti]].

In his youth he obtained a post in the Patent Office, but gave this up when he embarked on an early venture into billboard advertising at railway stations.  The venture was ahead of its time and he lost most of his money. The rest of his life he spent in relative poverty. The accounts of [[William Michael Rossetti]] (brother of Christina) portray him as a shy and unworldly intellectual with a cerebral sense of humour. He was a leading figure in the [[London]] [[Philological Society]]. He is said to have been asked by the [[SPCK]] to translate the New Testament into [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois]]; not knowing Iroquois, he allegedly learnt sufficient of the language in one month to be able to complete the task. He was born in [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]], the son of a [[Russia]]n merchant. He fell in love with the poet [[Christina Rossetti]] but she felt unable to marry him because he was an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] (she was a [[High Church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]). They remained close friends until his death, and several of her poems were written with him in mind. His brother was the mathematician [[Arthur Cayley]].

'''Clare Fell''' (1912&amp;ndash;2002) was a British archaeologist.

She was born in [[Ulverston]], [[Lancashire]] (now [[Cumbria]]), England. She read archaeology at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/has/ps/past/past42.html|title=Prehistoric Society - Past No. 42|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university did not allow women to take degrees at that time, and she received her MA in 1948. After the Second World War she worked at the [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge|Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] in Cambridge before moving back to Ulverston in 1953.

In 1949 she worked on [[Grahame Clark]]'s excavations at the [[Star Carr]] [[Mesolithic]] site in Yorkshire. 
Around the same time she began studying the [[Langdale axe industry]] in Cumbria, the project for which she is perhaps best remembered.&lt;ref name="Past"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.le.ac.uk/has/ps/past/past42.html#Fell | title=Obituary | publisher=[[The Prehistoric Society]] | work=Past | date=2002 | accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was not the first person to notice that [[Neolithic]] axes had been produced in [[Great Langdale]], but she was able to demonstrate the scale of the activity there, and used the word "factory" to describe it. She also guessed correctly that other quarries would be found on outcrops of volcanic [[tuff]] in the Lake District.

Fell kept up to date with scientific advances and collaborated with [[Winifred Pennington]] in the study of the effects of humans on the environment, resulting in pioneering [[Pollen analysis|pollen analyses]] for prehistoric artefact layers from sites in Cumbria.

==Television appearance==
Fell appeared in a discussion panel on the BBC television series [[Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?]] on 9 July 1953. The programme was directed by [[David Attenborough]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/64e5c2b421274122973be1618ab1a6b8 |title=Animal, Vegetable, Mineral |website=BBC Genome |access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

References to an '''expulsion of Jews from Rome''' by the Roman Emperor [[Claudius]], who was in office AD 41-54, appear in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:2|18:2]]), and in the writings of [[Roman historiography|Roman historians]] [[Suetonius]] (c. AD 69 – c. AD 122), [[Cassius Dio]] (c. AD 150 – c. 235) and fifth-century Christian author [[Paulus Orosius]]. Scholars generally agree that these references refer to the same incident.&lt;ref name=Reisner13&gt;[[Rainer Riesner]] "Pauline Chronology" in Stephen Westerholm ''The Blackwell Companion to Paul'' (May 16, 2011) {{ISBN|1405188448}} pp.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cradle110 &gt;Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=g-MG9sFLAz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780805443653&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LwKCU76QGYiXyASBv4LICQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=claudius&amp;f=false The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament]'' (2009) {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} p. 110, 400&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date is uncertain. The maximal time window for the expulsion of Jews from Rome is from January AD 41 until January AD 53. More detailed estimates such as those based on the AD 49 date by Orosius or the reduction of the AD 53 upper limit due to Proconsul [[Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus|Gallio's]] health are possible but controversial.

There were at least two expulsions of Jews from Rome before this event. In 139 BC the Jews were expelled after being accused of [[Conversion to Judaism|Judaizing]] among the local [[Gentile]]s. Then in AD 19 [[Tiberius]] once again expelled Jews from the city for similar reasons.

==Context==
There were at least two expulsions of Jews from Rome before the reign of the Roman Emperor Claudius. In 139 BC the Jews were expelled after being accused of aggressive missionary efforts. Then in AD 19 [[Tiberius]] once again expelled Jews from the city for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst, Jesus, 2000. pp. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acts of the Apostles==
The author of the Acts of the Apostles ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:1-18|18:1-18]]) explains how the [[Apostle Paul]] met [[Priscilla and Aquila]]&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt; and mentions in passing an expulsion of Jews from Rome:

{{quote|After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. 2 There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them, 3 and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them. 4 Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.

5 When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. 6 But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."

7 Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. 8 Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.

9 One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. 10 For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city." 11 So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.

12 While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment. 13 "This man," they charged, "is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law."

14 Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, "If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you. 15 But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law—settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things." 16 So he drove them off. 17 Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever.

18 Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila.}}

===Dating Acts by reference to Gallio or to Orosius===
[[File:The Temple of Apollo at Delphi.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]], where the [[Delphi Inscription]] was discovered in the 20th century, used to date the proconsulship of Gallio which provides a peg for the chronology of Paul.&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of Paul: An Introduction'' by Charles B. Puskas (Aug 3, 1993) {{ISBN|0814656900}} page 20 states: "The document of primary importance in determining a chronology of Paul is the Gallio Inscription found at Delphi"&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A fairly precise date for Acts 18:1-18 is derived from the mention of the [[proconsul]] [[Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus|Gallio]] in 18:12 and the existence of an [[Delphi Inscription|inscription]] found at [[Delphi]] and published in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gallio Inscription|url=http://www.wfu.edu/~horton/r102/gallio.html|accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; preserving a letter from Claudius concerning Gallio dated during the 26th acclamation of Claudius, sometime between January 51 and August 52.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Polhill, ''Paul and His Letters'', B&amp;H Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|9780805410976}}, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralph Novak states that the Delphi inscription clearly indicates that Gallio did not assume office any earlier than the spring of 50, adds that he may have served one or two years, and uses that to compute date ranges.&lt;ref name=Novak18/&gt; Working from a date prior to August AD 52 for the Gallio inscription, Novak considers the possibility that Gallio served for two years and calculates a possible range for Gallio's term of office from late spring of AD 50 to early summer of AD 54 depending on whether the inscription reflects a date late in Gallio's consulship or early. Slingerland accepts a wide date range for Paul's trial similar to that of Novak for Gallio's consulship and states that Paul could have arrived in Corinth up to 18 months earlier than the earliest possible start of Gallio's term of office or a short time before the end of Gallio's latest date.&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), p.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Udo Schnelle]] specifies that the reign of Gallio started in the summer of 51,&lt;ref name=Udo49&gt;''Apostle Paul: His Life and Theology'' by Udo Schnelle 2005 {{ISBN|0801027969}} page 49. See also ''The Book of Acts'' by F. F. Bruce 1998 {{ISBN|0802825052}} page 352 and ''The Greco-Roman World of the New Testament Era'' by James S. Jeffers (Oct 7, 1999) {{ISBN|0830815899}} page 164&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Craig S. Keener]] pinpoints the start of his term to July 51, although some scholars prefer 52.&lt;ref name=Keener51&gt;Craig S. Keener in ''The Blackwell Companion to Paul'' edited by Stephen Westerholm 2011 {{ISBN|1405188448}} page 51&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent dating of Acts is sometimes based on a controversial AD 49 date for Claudius's edict, reported by [[Orosius]] (see section on Paulus Orosius below): According to Novak, if Claudius's edict were issued in January of 49 and Paul came to Corinth and met Aquila and Priscilla, within six or so months of the edict, then an eighteen-month stay in Corinth would indicate a date after late spring of 50 and many days before January of 51 for Paul's trial.&lt;ref name=Novak18/&gt; At the other extreme, if Claudius's edict were issued in December of 49, using the same reasoning, the date of Paul's trial would be many days before the January of 52.&lt;ref name=Novak18/&gt; Michael R. Cosby states that the dates 49-50 for the expulsion of Jews from Rome support the date from the trial of Paul in Corinth, and are consistent with the account of the activities of Priscilla and Aquila given in Acts 18:24-26.&lt;ref name=Cosby142 &gt;''Apostle on the Edge: An Inductive Approach to Paul'' by Michael R. Cosby (Oct 20, 2009) {{ISBN|0664233082}} pages 142-143. See also ''Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Raymond E. Brown]] (30 Nov 1997) {{ISBN|0385247672}} page 433 and ''Introducing Romans: Critical Issues in Paul's Most Famous Letter'' by Richard N. Longenecker (Mar 25, 2011) {{ISBN|0802866190}} pages 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the maximal time window for the expulsion of Jews from Rome is January AD 41 (the accession of Claudius) until January AD 53 (18 months prior to the latest possible end of Gallio's term and thus the latest date for Paul's trial). More detailed estimates such as those based on the AD 49 date of Orosius are possible but controversial.

===The health of Gallio===
Gallio's brother Seneca reports in [[Wikisource:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 104|''Moral Epistles'' 104.1]] that Gallio ''began to develop a fever in Achaia and took ship at once, insisting that the disease was not of the body but of the place''. Furthermore, [[Pliny the Elder]] states in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' 31.33 that ''There are besides many other uses, the chief being a sea voyage for those attacked by [[Tuberculosis|consumption]], as I have said, and for [[haemoptysis]], such as quite recently within our memory was taken by Annæus Gallio after his consulship.''&lt;ref&gt;Plinius ''Natural History'' Book 31 chapter 33, translation by WHS Jones (1963) William Heinemann, London, 1963, p417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alternative translation ''There are numerous other medicinal resources derived from the sea; the benefit of a sea-voyage, more particularly, in cases of phthisis, as already mentioned, and where patients are suffering from hæmoptosis [hæmoptysis], as lately experienced, in our own memory, by Annæus Gallio, at the close of his consulship'' [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&amp;getid=1&amp;query=Plin.%20Nat.%2031.33].&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on these references, [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]] and a number of other scholars conclude that it is likely that the tenure of Gallio in Corinth lasted less than a full year, and due to health reasons Gallio left Corinth earlier, perhaps even before shipping on the Mediterranean stopped in October 51 due to winter storms.&lt;ref&gt;"Pauline Chronology" by [[Rainer Riesner]] ''The Blackwell Companion to Paul'' edited by Stephen Westerholm (May 16, 2011) {{ISBN|1405188448}} page 14. ''The Language of Belonging'' by Mary Katherine Birge (Dec 1, 2002) {{ISBN|9042911026}} page 3. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor "Paul and Gallio" Journal of Biblical Literature [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3267232?uid=3738296&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101196183337 Vol. 112, No. 2, 1993]. ''The First Epistle to the Corinthians'' by Anthony C Thiselton 2000 {{ISBN|0853645590}} pages 29-30. ''Apostle on the Edge: An Inductive Approach to Paul'' by Michael R. Cosby (Oct 20, 2009) {{ISBN|0664233082}} page 76&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that "it is impossible" to place Paul's trial by Gallio in the latter part of AD 51-52 and the trial must have happened between July when Gallio arrived in Corinth and September of 51.&lt;ref name=JMO21 &gt;''Paul: A Critical Life'' by J. Murphy-O'Connor (Sep 3, 1998) {{ISBN|0192853422}} pages 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy-O'Connor adds that this has "positive confirmation" in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#2:1|Galatians 2:1]] which "places Paul in Jerusalem in AD 51".&lt;ref name=JMO21 /&gt;

On the other hand, Pliny the Elder refers to only one sea cure by Gallio which was after he was consul presumably around AD 55,&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Haacker states, "Both Seneca and Plinius mention a sea voyage which Gallio chose as an immediate remedy against symptoms of phthisis when he was in Greece (not during his proconsulship as some modern writers wrongly assume)". Klaus Haacker, "Gallio", entry in the ''Anchor Bible Dictionary'' (Doubleday, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"L. Junius Annaeus Gallio, was suffect consul in the mid-50s AD, perhaps in 54." Robert C. Knapp, ''Roman Córdoba'' (University of California Press, 1992) {{ISBN|9780520096769}} p.42. "L. Junius Gallio did hold consulship in 55 or 56". Anthony Barrett, ''Agrippina: Sex, Power and Politics in the Early Empire'' (Routledge, 1999) {{ISBN|9780415208673}} p.280. "Gallio reached the consulship, probably in 55". Miriam T. Griffin, ''Nero: The End of a Dynasty'' (Routledge, 1987) {{ISBN|0415214645}} p.78. See also Wikipedia: [[List of Roman consuls#1st century AD|List of Roman consuls]] and [[List of state leaders in 56]].&lt;/ref&gt; and neither Seneca nor Pliny explicitly suggest that Gallio deserted his Achaea posting not to return.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Winter, "Rehabilitating Gallio and his Judgement in Acts 18:14-15" ''Tyndale Bulletin'' 57.2 (2006), pp.298-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Slingerland states that an argument regarding the shortening of Gallio's stay in Achaea due to health issues is "speculative".&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Gallio',  JBL 110, 3, p.446.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating problems===
Some scholars indicate difficulties trying to use Acts for strict chronological indications. Collins and Harrington state that Luke's account may be a conflation of various traditions and not entirely accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond F. Collins, Daniel J. Harrington, ''First Corinthians'' (Liturgical Press, 1993) {{ISBN|9780814658093}} p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome Murphy-O'Connor indicates that Acts 18 is "much less precise than appears at first sight." The expulsion was from Rome, but Aquila and Priscilla came from Italy, so they may have stayed in Italy after the expulsion, how long "no-one can say". He also questions the exactitude of what is meant by "recently"/"lately".&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, ''St. Paul's Corinth: Text and Archaeology'' (Liturgical Press, 2002) {{ISBN|9780814653036}} p.159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suetonius==
{{Main|Suetonius on Christians}}
A brief statement in [[wikisource:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Claudius#25|''Divus Claudius'' 25]] mentions agitations by the [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire#Jews in Rome and Romans in Jerusalem|"Jews"]] which led [[Claudius]] (Roman Emperor from AD 41 to 54) to expel them from Rome:

{{quote|Since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he [the Emperor Claudius] expelled them from Rome.}}

The expulsion event Suetonius refers to is necessarily later than AD 41,&lt;ref&gt;[[Rainer Riesner]], "Pauline Chronology" in ''The Blackwell Companion to Paul'', Stephen Westerholm (ed.) (Blackwell, 2011) {{ISBN|1405188448}} p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; and earlier than AD 54. The expulsion is mentioned in the last quarter of a list of Claudius's actions during his reign. However, precisely dating the expulsion from Suetonius provides some challenges because Suetonius writes in a topical rather than chronological fashion, necessitating the use of other texts to pinpoint the time.&lt;ref name=Dix306&gt;Slingerland, 'Suetonius "Claudius" 25.4 and the Account in Cassius Dio', ''JQR'' 79, 4, p.306&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jerry152/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reisner13/&gt; The dating of the "edict of Claudius" for the expulsion of Jews relies on three separate texts beyond Suetonius' own reference, which in chronological order are: the reference to the trial of Apostle Paul by Gallio in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:2|18:2]]),&lt;ref name=Jerry152&gt;Jerome Murphy-O'Connor ''St. Paul's Corinth: Texts and Archaeology'' (Aug 1, 2002) {{ISBN|0814653030}} p.152&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassius Dio]]'s reference in History 60.6.6-7, and [[Paulus Orosius]]'s fifth century mention in History 7.6.15-16 of a non-extant Josephus reference. Most scholars agree that the expulsion of Jews mentioned in the [[Book of Acts]]&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak18&gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 18-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keener51/&gt; is consistent with this report by Suetonius. Donna Hurley notes that Acts provides a date of 49, but adds that neither Tacitus nor Dio "reports an expulsion in 49 or 50 as would be expected if there had been a large exodus of the Jewish community", concluding that '"all" is probably a hyperbole.'&lt;ref&gt;Donna W. Hurley (ed.), ''Suetonius: Diuus Claudius'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001) {{ISBN|9780521596763}} p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage may suggest that in the mid-first century the Romans still viewed Christianity as a [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish sect]]. Historians debate whether or not the Roman government distinguished between [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|Christians and Jews]] prior to [[Nerva]]'s modification of the [[Fiscus Judaicus]] in AD 96. From then on, practising Jews paid the tax, Christians did not.&lt;ref name=fiscjud&gt;Wylen, Stephen M., ''The Jews in the Time of Jesus: An Introduction'', Paulist Press (1995), {{ISBN|0-8091-3610-4}}, pp.190-192; Dunn, James D.G., ''Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, 70 to 135'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing (1999), {{ISBN|0-8028-4498-7}}, Pp 33-34.; Boatwright, Mary Taliaferro &amp; Gargola, Daniel J &amp; Talbert, Richard John Alexander, ''The Romans: From Village to Empire'', Oxford University Press (2004), {{ISBN|0-19-511875-8}}, p.426;&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvia Cappelletti describes Claudius's motivation as the need to control the population of Rome and prevent political meetings. (He "did not have an anti-Jewish policy.")&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Cappelletti, ''The Jewish Community of Rome'' (Leiden: Brill, 2006) {{ISBN|9789004151574}} p.82.&lt;/ref&gt; Donna Hurley explains that Suetonius includes the expulsion "among problems with foreign populations, not among religions"&lt;ref&gt;Donna W. Hurley (ed.), ''Suetonius: Diuus Claudius'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001) {{ISBN|9780521596763}} p.176.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Feldman]] states that most scholars assume that the disturbances were due to the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|spread of Christianity in Rome]].&lt;ref name=Feldman332&gt;Louis H. Feldman, ''Jewish Life and Thought among Greeks and Romans'' (Oct 1, 1996) {{ISBN|0567085252}} p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn states that the disturbances Suetonius refers to were probably caused by the objections of Jewish community to preachings by early Christians; Dunn moreover perceives confusion in Suetonius which would weaken the historical value of the reference as a whole.&lt;ref name=Dunn141&gt;James D. G. Dunn ''Jesus Remembered'' (2003) {{ISBN|0-8028-3931-2}} pp. 141-143&lt;/ref&gt; Lane states that the cause of the disturbance was likely the preachings of Hellenistic Jews in Rome and their insistence that Jesus was the Messiah, resulting in tensions with the Jews in Rome.&lt;ref name=Lane204 &gt;William L. Lane in ''Judaism and Christianity in First-Century Rome'' edited by Karl Paul Donfried and Peter Richardson (1998) {{ISBN|0802842658}} pp. 204-206&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, E.A. Judge states that Suetonius later introduces Christians "in a way that leaves no doubt that he is discussing them for the first time" (i.e. in Nero 16), bringing into doubt an interpretation that Suetonius is dealing with Christians in Claudius 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. A. Judge|editor=James R. Harrison|title=The First Christians in the Roman World: Augustan and New Testament Essays|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2008|ISBN=9783161493102}} p.446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars are divided on the identity of "Chrestus" in the Suetonius reference. Some such as [[Craig A. Evans]], [[John P. Meier|John Meier]] and [[Craig S. Keener]] see it as a likely reference to Jesus.&lt;ref name=BoydE166&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory. ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition'' (2007) {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pages 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gospels' page 66"&gt;Craig S. Keener, ''The Historical Jesus of the Gospels'' (2012) {{ISBN|0802868886}} p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Menahem Stern said Suetonius was definitely referring to Jesus Christ, because he would have added "a certain" to Chrestus, if he had meant some unknown agitator.&lt;ref&gt;Menahem Stern, Jerusalem, 1980, Greek and Latin Authors on Jews and Judaism vol. 2 , p 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars disagree: Stephen Benko sees "Chrestus" as an otherwise unknown agitator in Rome, whereas H. Dixon Slingerland sees him as someone who influenced Claudius to expel Jews.&lt;ref name="impchre"&gt;D. Slingerland, "Chrestus: Christus?" in A. J. Avery-Peck, ''New Perspectives on Ancient Judaism'' 4 (Lanham: University Press of America, 1989) {{ISBN|9780819171795}} p.143. The same view has been espoused by Neil Elliot, ("''impulsore Chresto'' probably refers to "Chrestus" having prompted Claudius' expulsion, not the Jews' disturbances": Neil Elliot, "The Letter to the Romans" in R. S. Sugirtharajah and Fernando F. Segovia (eds.)

==Cassius Dio==
[[Cassius Dio]] makes a comment in 60.6.6-7 regarding an action early in the reign of Claudius:&lt;ref name=Dix306/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jerry152/&gt;

{{quote|As for the Jews, who had again increased so greatly that by reason of their multitude it would have been hard without raising a tumult to bar them from the city [Rome], he [Claudius] did not drive them out, but ordered them, while continuing their traditional mode of life, not to hold meetings.}}

The similarities are noteworthy, for both Suetonius and Cassius Dio deal with Jews, tumult, Claudius, the city and expulsion,&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Cassius Dio', ''JQR'' 79, 4, p.316&lt;/ref&gt; and Cassius Dio does provide a chronological context that points to the year AD 41.&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Cassius Dio', ''JQR'' 79, 4, (1988) p.307&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cassius Dio does not mention Chrestus or any cause for the emperor's actions. Moreover, Cassius Dio says that Claudius ''did not'' drive the Jews out of the city, which prompts Slingerland to conclude that "Suetonius Claudius 25.4 does not refer to the event narrated in Dio 60.6.6-7." [[Rainer Riesner]] states that ancient historians generally hold that Cassius Dio here may have referred to an earlier, more limited action against some Jews, which was later expanded by Claudius to the expulsion of a larger group of Jews.&lt;ref name=Reisner13/&gt;

Raymond E. Brown states that Dio specifically rejects a general expulsion and it would be more reasonable to assume that only the most vocal people on either side of the Christ issue were expelled.&lt;ref name=Brown102&gt;Raymond E. Brown and John P. Meier ''Antioch and Rome'' (May 1983) {{ISBN|0809125323}} page 102&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman states that the expulsion mentioned by Dio refers to the same event in Suetonius, but had a limited nature.&lt;ref name=Feldman304/&gt; Feldman states that given that Claudius' Jewish friend [[Agrippa I]] had been helpful in his ascent to the throne as in Ant 19.236-44, and given Claudius' actions in Ant 20.10-14 it seems hard to believe that Claudius would have expelled all the Jews due to a single agitator, soon after assuming the throne.&lt;ref name=Feldman304&gt;''Jew and Gentile in the Ancient World'' by Louis H. Feldman (Oct 14, 1996) {{ISBN|069102927X}} page 304&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman states that the most likely explanation is that Claudius at first either expelled only the Christians or restricted public assembly by the Jews.&lt;ref name=Feldman304/&gt;

In general, Cassius Dio does not use the word "Christian" in his ''Roman History'', and appears not to distinguish (or unable to distinguish) Jews from Christians. Given this viewpoint, the large Christian population in Rome that Cassius Dio witnesses in his own time (up to AD 229) would appear to him to conflict with any historical reports of massive Jewish expulsions, such as that of AD 41. Thus providing the reason for Cassius Dio convincing himself that Jewish expulsions had not happened.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous Christian layman, 19 Nov 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paulus Orosius==
[[File:Paulo Orosio - Lámina siglo VI.jpg|thumb|250px|A page from a sixth-century [[Paulus Orosius]] ''Histories'' manuscript, [[Florence]].]]
The 5th-century Christian writer [[Orosius|Paulus Orosius]] makes a possible reference to the event, citing two sources:

{{quote|Josephus reports, 'In his ninth year the Jews were expelled by Claudius from the city.' But Suetonius, who speaks as follows, influences me more: 'Claudius expelled from Rome the Jews constantly rioting at the instigation of Christ [Christo, or rather ''xpo''].' As far as whether he had commanded that the Jews rioting against Christ [Christum] be restrained and checked or also had wanted the Christians, as persons of a cognate religion, to be expelled, it is not at all to be discerned.&lt;ref&gt;Historiarum adversum paganos libri VII 7.6.15-16, cited in Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first source used by Orosius comes from a non-extant quote from Josephus.&lt;ref name="oro137"&gt;Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this which provides the date of AD 49. His second source is Suetonius Claudius 25.4.

Slingerland contends that Orosius made up the Josephus passage for which no scholar has been able to discover a source.&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that the writer is guilty of manipulating source materials for polemic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), pp. 139-141.&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman states that "there is no such statement in the extant manuscripts of Josephus, and there is reason to believe that this version was created in the mind of Orosius himself."&lt;ref&gt;Louis H. Feldman, ''Jew and Gentile in the Ancient World: Attitudes and Interactions From Alexander To Justinian'' (Princeton University Press, 1996) {{ISBN|9780691029276}} p.304.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Esler agrees with Slingerland that the AD 49 date "is a creation fully explicable within the tendentious historiography of this author."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Francis Esler, ''Conflict and Identity in Romans: The Social Setting of Paul's Letter'' (Augsburg Fortress, 2004) {{ISBN|9780800634353}} p.99.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, E. M. Smallwood states that Orosius may have known of a passage from another author but confused the Josephus passage with it, or may have been quoting from memory.&lt;ref name=EMSmall210&gt;E. Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian'' (Oct 1, 2001) {{ISBN|039104155X}} pp. 210-211&lt;/ref&gt; Silvia Cappelletti states that the change in spelling was probably not due to Orosius but to an intermediate source he consulted.&lt;ref name=Silvia73 &gt;''The Jewish Community in Rome: From the Second Century B. C. to the Third Century C. E.'' by Silvia Cappelletti (Aug 1, 2006) {{ISBN|9004151575}} pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; Cappelletti also states that the lack of the Josephus text referred to does not undermine the authority of the date Orosius has suggested.&lt;ref name=Silvia73 /&gt; Brown tactfully states, "Orosius is not famous for his impeccable accuracy," then adds that "such a date" (i.e. 49) "receives some confirmation from Acts."&lt;ref name=Brown102/&gt; Bernard Green states that given that this section of Orosius' history is based on the chronological order of events, and that he refers to the expulsion only briefly and attaches no significance to it, Orosius seems to be "guiltlessly reporting" an event based on records he had seen.&lt;ref name=bgreen&gt;''Christianity in Ancient Rome: The First Three Centuries'' by Bernard Green (Apr 15, 2010) {{ISBN|0567032507}} page 25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rainer Riesner]] notes that it is not possible for Orosius to have derived the date of the expulsion that he wrote about from the [[Book of Acts]].&lt;ref name=Reisner13/&gt;

== Judging ==
Cresta is an extensive and highly selective awards program, an official 2017 press release noting a reception of more than 3,300 entries from 53 countries for the 2016 competition, with 74 entries from 13 countries designated as winners.&lt;ref name="2014 Press"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/Press.aspx Cresta Awards Issue Call for Entries in Its 25th Annual Worldwide Creative Competition] Press Release, February 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Entries are screened by several international "pre-selection" juries responsible for compiling a shortlist to be given to a Grand Jury of seasoned creative directors, graphic artists, and film specialists from around the world. The Cresta Grand Jury, unlike the pre-selection juries, is a permanent jury consisting of 86 members from 45 countries. Members judge the shortlisted entries on their own time and individually, the no-discussion policy placing stress on creativity solely.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; This body decides on the Gold, Silver, and Bronze winners, as well as if an entry has met the pre-determined standard of earning a '''Grand Prix''' award, based on two elements: originality of the idea and the quality of the idea's execution.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Straits" /&gt;  

In 2010, Cresta introduced the '''Network of the Year''' and '''Agency of the Year''' honors, given out to those whose entries meet the highest scores, based on a point breakdown, in all levels of competition.&lt;ref name="2010 Press"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/PressArchive.aspx 18th Annual Cresta International Advertising Awards Announce Winners] Press Release, October 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7338">[[File:Baptism-of-Christ-xx-Francesco-Alban.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|''Baptism of Christ'' by Francesco Albani. Since it positions John as superior to Jesus, the criterion of embarrassment has been used to argue for the historicity of the [[baptism of Jesus]] by [[John the Baptist]].]]

The '''criterion of embarrassment''' is a type of critical analysis in which an account likely to be embarrassing to its author is presumed to be true as the author would have no reason to invent an account which might embarrass him or her. Certain [[Biblical criticism|Biblical scholars]] have used this as a metric for assessing whether the [[New Testament]]'s accounts of [[Jesus]]' actions and words are [[criteria of authenticity and the historical Jesus|historically probable]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;Catherine M. Murphy, ''The Historical Jesus For Dummies'', For Dummies Pub., 2007. p 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The criterion of embarrassment is one point listed in the Criteria of Authenticity used by academics, the others being the [[criterion of dissimilarity]], criterion of language and environment, criterion of coherence, and the [[criterion of multiple attestation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In Quest of Jesus|last = Tatum|first = W. Barnes|publisher = Abingdon Press|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Nashville|page = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The criterion of embarrassment is a long-standing tool of New Testament research. The phrase was used by [[John P. Meier]] in his book ''A Marginal Jew''; he attributed it to [[Edward Schillebeeckx]], who does not appear to have actually used the term. The earliest usage of the approach was possibly by [[Paul Wilhelm Schmiedel]] in the ''[[Encyclopaedia Biblica]]'' (1899).&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E. Porter, ''Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research'' (Continuum, 2004) pages 106-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The assumption of the criterion of embarrassment is that the [[early church]] would hardly have gone out of its way to create or falsify historical material that embarrassed its author or weakened its position in arguments with opponents. Rather, embarrassing material coming from Jesus would be either suppressed or softened in later stages of the [[Gospel]] tradition. This criterion is rarely used by itself, and is typically one of a number of criteria, such as the [[criterion of dissimilarity]] and the [[criterion of multiple attestation]], along with the [[historical method]].

The [[crucifixion of Jesus]] is an example of an event that meets the criterion of embarrassment. This method of [[execution]] was considered the most shameful and degrading in the [[Roman world]], and advocates of the criterion claim this method of execution is therefore the least likely to have been invented by the followers of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Davenport and Benjamin Urrutia, ''The Logia of Yeshua'', Washington, DC 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew'', Yale University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.S.Gill, [http://ancienthistory.about.com/b/a/229667.htm ''Discussion of the Historical Jesus''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316185139/http://ancienthistory.about.com/b/a/229667.htm |date=March 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blue.butler.edu/~jfmcgrat/jesus/intro.htm |title=Blue Butler Education, '&amp;#39;Historical Study of Jesus of Nazareth - An Introduction'&amp;#39; |publisher=Blue.butler.edu |date=2005-03-04 |accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
The criterion of embarrassment has its limitations and is almost always used in concert with the other criteria. One limitation to the criterion of embarrassment is that clear-cut cases of such embarrassment are few. A full portrait of Jesus could never be based on so little data. Clearly, context is important, as what might be considered as embarrassing in one era and social context may not have been so in another. Embarrassing details may be included as an alternative to an even more embarrassing account of the same event. As a hypothetical example, [[Saint Peter]]'s denial of Jesus could have been a substitution for an even greater misdeed of Peter.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew'', Yale University Press, 2009. p 170&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the second point is found in the stories of the [[Infancy Gospels]]. In one account from the [[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]], a very young Jesus is said to have used his [[supernatural power]]s first to strike dead, and then revive, a playmate who had accidentally bumped into him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this tradition had been accepted as worthy of inclusion at some key juncture in the formation of the [[Bible#Old and New Testaments|Christian Bible]] (and hence integrated in one way or another among the [[Canonical gospels|canonical Gospels]]), arguably many modern Christians would find it quite embarrassing—especially strict believers in [[biblical inerrancy]]. But as is suggested by the existence of this early non-canonical [[pericope]], it must not have been embarrassing to some [[Early Christianity|early Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Bart D. Ehrman, ''[[Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium]],'' Oxford, 1999. pp 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus'',  Doubleday, 1991. v. 1, pp 174–175, 317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E. Porter, ''The Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research: Previous Discussion and New Proposals'' Sheffield Academic Press,  2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerd Thiessen]] &amp; Dagmar Winter.  ''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further limitation is the possibility that what could be classed as embarrassing could also be an intentionally created account designed to provoke a reaction. For instance, [[Saint Peter]]'s denial of Jesus could have been written as an example of the consequences of denial. {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:32-33|NIV}}: "Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven."

A still further limitation is the fact that of all the criteria to evaluate authenticity, the criterion of embarrassment may be the most easily forged. A person who knows that having extra witnesses will bolster their credibility still has a lot of hard and uncertain work to do before they will have those witnesses on their side. A person who knows that including embarrassing details will make them more believable need do no more work than invent some embarrassing details.

'''Cubism''' is an early-20th-century [[art movement]] which brought European [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] historically forward toward 20th century [[Modern art]]. Cubism in its various forms inspired related movements in [[literature]] and [[architecture]].

The movement was pioneered by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], joined by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], and [[Fernand Léger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, MoMA collection ''Cubism, Origins and application of the term'', from Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613022945/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541 |date=2014-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] form in the late works of [[Paul Cézanne]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813112047/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1 |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.&lt;ref name="Joann Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J.

The impact of Cubism was far-reaching and wide-ranging. In other countries [[Futurism]], [[Suprematism]], [[Dada]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[De Stijl]] and [[Art Deco]] developed in response to Cubism. Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time, also called multiple perspective, [[simultaneity]] or multiplicity,&lt;ref name="MoMA, Meanings and interpretations"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702090838/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544 |date=2015-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10955&amp;section_id=T019195#skipToContent Christina Lodder, 2009, ''Constructivism, Formation, 1914–21'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024234226/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10955&amp;section_id=T019195 |date=2008-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life.

==History==
Historians have divided the history of Cubism into phases. In one scheme, the first phase of Cubism, known as ''Analytic Cubism'', a phrase coined by Juan Gris a posteriori,&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 784. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in France. A second phase, ''Synthetic Cubism'', remained vital until around 1919, when the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movement gained popularity. English [[art historian]] [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]] proposed another scheme, describing three phases of Cubism in his book, ''The Cubist Epoch''. According to Cooper there was "Early Cubism", (from 1906 to 1908) when the movement was initially developed in the studios of Picasso and Braque; the second phase being called "High Cubism", (from 1909 to 1914) during which time [[Juan Gris]] emerged as an important exponent (after 1911); and finally Cooper referred to "Late Cubism" (from 1914 to 1921) as the last phase of Cubism as a radical [[avant-garde]] movement.&lt;ref name="The Cubist Epoch"&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up "The Cubist Epoch"], pp. 11–221, 232, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Cooper's restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris (from 1911) and Léger (to a lesser extent) implied an intentional value judgement.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

===Proto-Cubism: 1907-1908===
{{main|Proto-Cubism}}
Cubism burgeoned between 1907 and 1911. Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' has often been considered a [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] work. Georges Braque's 1908 ''[[Houses at L’Estaque]]'' (and related works) prompted the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]], in ''Gil Blas'', 25 March 1909, to refer to ''bizarreries cubiques'' (cubic oddities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7536065n Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 25 March 1909], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gertrude Stein]] referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as ''Reservoir at Horta de Ebro'', as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] in [[Paris]] during the spring of 1911 in a room called 'Salle 41'; it included works by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], yet no works by Picasso or Braque were exhibited.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

By 1911 Picasso was recognized as the inventor of Cubism, while Braque’s importance and precedence was argued later, with respect to his treatment of space, volume and mass in the L’Estaque landscapes. But "this view of Cubism is associated with a distinctly restrictive definition of which artists are properly to be called Cubists," wrote the art historian Christopher Green: "Marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1911 [...]"&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The assertion that the Cubist depiction of space, mass, time, and volume supports (rather than contradicts) the flatness of the canvas was made by [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] as early as 1920,&lt;ref&gt;D.-H. Kahnweiler. Der Weg zum Kubismus (Munich, 1920; Eng. trans., New York, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt; but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially by [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Greenberg. ‘The Pasted-paper Revolution’, ARTnews, 57 (1958), pp. 46–9, 60–61; repr. as ‘Collage’ in Art and Culture (Boston, 1961), pp. 70–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary views of Cubism are complex, formed to some extent in response to the "Salle 41" Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely secondary to them. Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed. Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the "Salle 41" artists, e.g., [[Francis Picabia]]; the brothers [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the [[Section d'Or]] (or the [[Puteaux Group]]); the sculptors [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]] as well as [[Jacques Lipchitz]] and [[Henri Laurens]]; and painters such as [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[František Kupka]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Léopold Survage]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[André Lhote]], [[Gino Severini]] (after 1916), [[María Blanchard]] (after 1916) and [[Georges Valmier]] (after 1918). More fundamentally, Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper's terms were "later undermined by interpretations of the work of Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation."&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

[[John Berger]] identifies the essence of Cubism with the mechanical diagram. "The metaphorical model of Cubism is the diagram: The diagram being a visible symbolic representation of invisible processes, forces, structures. A diagram need not eschew certain aspects of appearance but these too will be treated as signs not as imitations or recreations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=John|title=The Moment of Cubism|year=1969|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780297177098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High Cubism: 1909-1914 ===
[[File:Albert Gleizes, l'Homme au Balcon, 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Albert Gleizes]], ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|L'Homme au Balcon, Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]'', 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm (77 x 45 1/4 in.), [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Completed the same year that Albert Gleizes co-authored the book ''Du "Cubisme"'' with Jean Metzinger. Exhibited at Salon d'Automne, Paris, 1912, [[Armory show]], New York, Chicago, Boston, 1913]]
There was a distinct difference between Kahnweiler’s Cubists and the Salon Cubists. Prior to 1914, Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger (to a lesser extent) gained the support of a single committed art dealer in Paris, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who guaranteed them an annual income for the exclusive right to buy their works. Kahnweiler sold only to a small circle of connoisseurs. His support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy. Picasso worked in Montmartre until 1912, while Braque and Gris remained there until after the First World War. Léger was based in Montparnasse.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

In contrast, the Salon Cubists built their reputation primarily by exhibiting regularly at the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Indépendants, both major non-academic Salons in Paris. They were inevitably more aware of public response and the need to communicate.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; Already in 1910 a group began to form which included Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay and Léger. They met regularly at Henri le Fauconnier's studio near the Boulevard de Montparnasse. These soirées often included writers such as Guillaume Apollinaire and [[André Salmon]]. Together with other young artists, the group wanted to emphasise a research into form, in opposition to the Neo-Impressionist emphasis on color.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie"&gt;[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie (in French)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112092816/http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf |date=November 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1910 Salon d'Automne, a few months later, Metzinger exhibited his highly fractured ''[[Nu à la cheminée|Nu à la cheminée (Nude)]]'', which was subsequently reproduced in both ''Du "Cubisme"'' (1912) and ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' (1913).&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

The first public controversy generated by Cubism resulted from Salon showings at the Indépendants during the spring of 1911. This showing by Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, le Fauconnier and Léger brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the first time. Amongst the Cubist works presented, Robert Delaunay exhibited his ''Eiffel Tower, Tour Eiffel'' (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1022 Robert Delaunay, Eiffel Tower (Tour Eiffel), 1911 (dated 1910 by the artist).

At the Salon d'Automne of the same year, in addition to the Indépendants group of ''Salle 41'', were exhibited works by [[André Lhote]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], Jacques Villon, [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]] and [[František Kupka]]. The exhibition was reviewed in the October 8, 1911 issue of ''The New York Times''.

:"Among all the paintings on exhibition at the Paris Fall Salon none is attracting so much attention as the extraordinary productions of the so-called "Cubist" school. In fact, dispatches from Paris suggest that these works are easily the main feature of the exhibition. [...]

:In spite of the crazy nature of the "Cubist" theories the number of those professing them is fairly respectable.

The subsequent 1912 Salon des Indépendants was marked by the presentation of Marcel Duchamp's ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'', which itself caused a scandal, even amongst the Cubists. It was in fact rejected by the hanging committee, which included his brothers and other Cubists. Although the work was shown in the Salon de la Section d'Or in October 1912 and the 1913 Armory Show in New York, Duchamp never forgave his brothers and former colleagues for censoring his work.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51449.html?mulR=24120|3 Philadelphia Museum of Art, Marcel Duchamp, Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918063503/http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51449.html?mulR=24120%7C3 |date=2017-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Gris, a new addition to the Salon scene, exhibited his ''Portrait of Picasso'' (Art Institute of Chicago), while Metzinger's two showings included ''[[La Femme au Cheval|La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse)]]'' 1911-1912 ([[National Gallery of Denmark]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/the-royal-collections/french-art-1900-1930/highlights/jean-metzinger-woman-with-a-horse/ Statens Museum for Kunst, National Gallery of Denmark, Jean Metzinger, ''Woman with a Horse'', 1911–1912, oil on canvas, 162 x 130 cm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115151153/http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/the-royal-collections/french-art-1900-1930/highlights/jean-metzinger-woman-with-a-horse/ |date=January 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaunay's monumental ''La Ville de Paris'' (Musée d'art moderne de la Ville de Paris) and Léger's ''La Noce, The Wedding'' (Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris) were also exhibited.

The Cubist contribution to the [[Salon d'Automne#1912.2C political ramifications|1912 Salon d'Automne]] created scandal regarding the use of government owned buildings, such as the [[Grand Palais]], to exhibit such artwork. The indignation of the politician [[Jean Pierre Philippe Lampué]] made the front page of ''Le Journal'', 5 October 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7625001c/f1.image ''M.

It was against this background of public anger that Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes wrote ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (published by Eugène Figuière in 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070918235710/http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/albert-gleizes-oeuvre.html Fondation Gleizes, Son Oeuvre]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works exhibited were [[Henri Le Fauconnier|Le Fauconnier]]'s vast composition ''Les Montagnards attaqués par des ours (Mountaineers Attacked by Bears)'' now at Rhode Island School of Design Museum, [[Joseph Csaky]]'s ''Deux Femme, Two Women'' (a sculpture now lost), in addition to the highly abstract paintings by Kupka, ''Amorpha'' (The National Gallery, Prague), and [[Picabia]], ''La Source, The Spring'' (Museum of Modern Art, New York).

====Abstraction and the ready-made====
[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1912, Les Fenêtres simultanée sur la ville (Simultaneous Windows on the City), 40 x 46 cm, Kunsthalle Hamburg.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Delaunay]], ''Simultaneous Windows on the City'', 1912, 46 x 40 cm, [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]], an example of ''Abstract Cubism'']]
The most extreme forms of Cubism were not those practiced by Picasso and Braque, who resisted total abstraction. Other Cubists, by contrast, especially [[František Kupka]], and those considered [[Orphism (art)|Orphists]] by [[Apollinaire]] (Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka’s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, ''Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs'' and ''Amorpha chromatique chaude'', were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled ''Simultaneous Windows'', followed by a series entitled ''Formes Circulaires'', in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913–14 Léger produced a series entitled ''Contrasts of Forms'', giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in ''Les Peintres cubistes'' (1913),&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt; writing of a new "pure" painting in which the subject was vacated. But in spite of his use of the term Orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

Also labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp was responsible for another extreme development inspired by Cubism. The [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|ready-made]] arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). The next logical step, for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The ''Section d'Or'', also known as ''Groupe de Puteaux'', founded by some of the most conspicuous Cubists, was a collective of painters, sculptors and critics associated with Cubism and Orphism, active from 1911 through about 1914, coming to prominence in the wake of their controversial showing at the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. The ''Salon de la Section d'Or'' at the ''Galerie La Boétie'' in Paris, October 1912, was arguably the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition; exposing Cubism to a wide audience. Over 200 works were displayed, and the fact that many of the artists showed artworks representative of their development from 1909 to 1912 gave the exhibition the allure of a Cubist retrospective.&lt;ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism"&gt;[http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm The History and Chronology of Cubism, p. 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314010756/http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm |date=2013-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group seems to have adopted the name Section d'Or to distinguish themselves from the narrower definition of Cubism developed in parallel by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] in the [[Montmartre]] quarter of Paris, and to show that Cubism, rather than being an isolated art-form, represented the continuation of a grand tradition (indeed, the [[golden ratio]] had fascinated Western intellectuals of diverse interests for at least 2,400 years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+numéro+spécial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg La Section d'Or, Numéro spécial, 9 Octobre 1912] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403151309/http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+num%C3%A9ro+sp%C3%A9cial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg |date=2017-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the Section d'Or originated in the course of conversations between Metzinger, Gleizes and Jacques Villon. The group's title was suggested by Villon, after reading a 1910 translation of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Codex Urbinas|Trattato della Pittura]]'' by [[Joséphin Péladan]].

The fact that the 1912 exhibition had been curated to show the successive stages through which Cubism had developed, and that ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' had been published for the occasion, indicates the artists' intention of making their work comprehensible to a wide audience (art critics, art collectors, art dealers and the general public). Undoubtedly, due to the great success of the exhibition, Cubism became recognized as a tendency, genre or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal.&lt;ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism" /&gt;

===Late Cubism: 1914-1921===
{{main|Crystal Cubism}}

====Crystal Cubism: 1914-1918====

A significant modification of Cubism between 1914 and 1916 was signaled by a shift towards a strong emphasis on large overlapping geometric planes and flat surface activity. This grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector [[Léonce Rosenberg]]. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the critic [[Maurice Raynal]] as 'crystal' Cubism. Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of [[World War I]]—such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, the occult, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7ZuQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Christopher+Green,+%27%27Cubism+and+Its+Enemies:+Modern+Movements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gliFVJKzJcizUe3AghA&amp;redir_esc=y Christopher Green, ''Cubism and Its Enemies: Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101225927/https://books.google.com/books?id=e7ZuQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Christopher+Green,+%27%27Cubism+and+Its+Enemies:+Modern+Movements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gliFVJKzJcizUe3AghA&amp;redir_esc=y |date=2016-01-01 }}'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, {{ISBN|0300034687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal Cubism, and its associative ''rappel à l’ordre'', has been linked with an inclination—by those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sector—to escape the realities of the Great War, both during and directly following the conflict. The purifying of Cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader [[Ideology|ideological]] transformation towards [[conservatism]] in both French society and [[Culture of France|French culture]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

====Cubism after 1918====
[[File:Picasso three musicians moma 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''[[Three Musicians]]'' (1921), [[Museum of Modern Art]]. ''Three Musicians'' is a classic example of Synthetic cubism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78630 |title=The Museum of Modern Art |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most innovative period of Cubism was before 1914. After World War I, with the support given by the dealer [[Léonce Rosenberg]], Cubism returned as a central issue for artists, and continued as such until the mid-1920s when its avant-garde status was rendered questionable by the emergence of [[geometric abstraction]] and [[Surrealism]] in [[Paris]]. Many Cubists, including Picasso, Braque, Gris, Léger, Gleizes, and Metzinger, while developing other styles, returned periodically to Cubism, even well after 1925. Cubism reemerged during the 1920s and the 1930s in the work of the American [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and the Englishman [[Ben Nicholson]]. In France, however, Cubism experienced a decline beginning in about 1925. Léonce Rosenberg exhibited not only the artists stranded by Kahnweiler’s exile but others including Laurens, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Gleizes, Csaky, Herbin and Severini. In 1918 Rosenberg presented a series of Cubist exhibitions at his Galerie de l’Effort Moderne in Paris. Attempts were made by Louis Vauxcelles to claim that Cubism was dead, but these exhibitions, along with a well-organized Cubist show at the 1920 Salon des Indépendants and a revival of the Salon de la Section d’Or in the same year, demonstrated it was still alive.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The reemergence of Cubism coincided with the appearance from about 1917–24 of a coherent body of theoretical writing by Pierre Reverdy, Maurice Raynal and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and, among the artists, by Gris, Léger and Gleizes. The occasional return to classicism—figurative work either exclusively or alongside Cubist work—experienced by many artists during this period (called [[Neoclassicism]]) has been linked to the tendency to evade the realities of the war and also to the cultural dominance of a classical or Latin image of France during and immediately following the war. Cubism after 1918 can be seen as part of a wide ideological shift towards [[conservatism]] in both [[French culture|French]] society and culture. Yet, Cubism itself remained evolutionary both within the oeuvre of individual artists, such as Gris and Metzinger, and across the work of artists as different from each other as Braque, Léger and Gleizes. Cubism as a publicly debated movement became relatively unified and open to definition. Its theoretical purity made it a gauge against which such diverse tendencies as [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] or [[Realism (arts)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealizing|Naturalism]], [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]] and abstraction could be compared.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

==Interpretation==
===Intentions and criticism===
[[File:Juan Gris - Portrait of Pablo Picasso - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|[[Juan Gris]], ''Portrait of Picasso'', 1912, oil on canvas, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
The Cubism of Picasso, Braque and Gris had more than a technical or formal significance, and the distinct attitudes and intentions of the Salon Cubists produced different kinds of Cubism, rather than a derivative of their work. "It is by no means clear, in any case," wrote Christopher Green, "to what extent these other Cubists depended on Picasso and Braque for their development of such techniques as faceting, 'passage' and multiple perspective; they could well have arrived at such practices with little knowledge of 'true' Cubism in its early stages, guided above all by their own understanding of Cézanne." The works exhibited by these Cubists at the 1911 and 1912 Salons extended beyond the conventional Cézanne-like subjects—the posed model, still-life and landscape—favored by Picasso and Braque to include large-scale modern-life subjects. Aimed at a large public, these works stressed the use of multiple perspective and complex planar faceting for expressive effect while preserving the eloquence of subjects endowed with literary and philosophical connotations.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

In ''Du "Cubisme"'' Metzinger and Gleizes explicitly related the sense of time to multiple perspective, giving symbolic expression to the notion of ‘duration’ proposed by the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuum, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. The Salon Cubists used the faceted treatment of solid and space and effects of multiple viewpoints to convey a physical and psychological sense of the fluidity of consciousness, blurring the distinctions between past, present and future. One of the major theoretical innovations made by the Salon Cubists, independently of Picasso and Braque, was that of ''simultaneity'',&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; drawing to greater or lesser extent on theories of [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]], [[Maurice Princet]], and Henri Bergson. With simultaneity, the concept of separate spatial and temporal dimensions was comprehensively challenged. [[Perspective (graphical)|Linear perspective]] developed during [[the Renaissance]] was vacated. The subject matter was no longer considered from a specific point of view at a moment in time, but built following a selection of successive viewpoints, i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous angles (and in multiple dimensions) with the eye free to roam from one to the other.&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;

This technique of representing simultaneity, multiple viewpoints (or [[relative motion]]) is pushed to a high degree of complexity in Gleizes' monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing|Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)]]'', exhibited at the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or, Le Fauconnier’s ''Abundance'' shown at the Indépendants of 1911, and Delaunay's ''City of Paris'', shown at the Indépendants in 1912. These ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism. Léger’s ''The Wedding'', also shown at the Salon des Indépendants in 1912, gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force. The conjunction of such subject matter with simultaneity aligns Salon Cubism with early Futurist paintings by [[Umberto Boccioni]], Gino Severini and [[Carlo Carrà]]; themselves made in response to early Cubism.&lt;ref name="MoMA, Meanings and interpretations" /&gt;

Cubism and [[modern art|modern European art]] was introduced into the United States at the now legendary 1913 [[Armory Show]] in [[New York City]], which then traveled to [[Chicago]] and [[Boston]]. In the Armory show [[Pablo Picasso]] exhibited ''La Femme au pot de moutarde'' (1910), the sculpture ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'' (1909–10), ''Les Arbres'' (1907) amongst other cubist works. [[Jacques Villon]] exhibited seven important and large drypoints, while his brother [[Marcel Duchamp]] shocked the American public with his painting ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' (1912). [[Francis Picabia]] exhibited his abstractions ''La Danse à la source'' and ''La Procession, Seville'' (both of 1912). [[Albert Gleizes]] exhibited ''[[La Femme aux Phlox (Gleizes)|La Femme aux phlox]]'' (1910) and ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|L'Homme au balcon]]'' (1912), two highly stylized and faceted cubist works. [[Georges Braque]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] and [[Alexander Archipenko]] also contributed examples of their cubist works.

===Stylistic interpretation===
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Europeans were discovering [[African culture|African]], Polynesian, [[Micronesia]]n and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]], and Pablo Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those foreign cultures. Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through [[Gertrude Stein]], at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in [[primitivism]], [[Iberians|Iberian]] sculpture, [[African art]] and [[African tribal masks]]. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of Greek, Iberian and African art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as [[Proto-Cubism|Protocubism]], as notably seen in ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedent]] of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24" /&gt;

[[File:Paul Cézanne 163.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Quarry Bibémus'', 1898-1900, [[Museum Folkwang]], [[Essen]], [[Germany]]]]
The art historian Douglas Cooper states that [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] "were particularly influential to the formation of Cubism and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907".&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper goes on to say: "The ''Demoiselles'' is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, [[expressionist]] element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the ''Demoiselles'' is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it."&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24"/&gt;

The most serious objection to regarding the ''Demoiselles'' as the origin of Cubism, with its evident influence of primitive art, is that "such deductions are unhistorical", wrote the art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]]. This familiar explanation "fails to give adequate consideration to the complexities of a flourishing art that existed just before and during the period when Picasso's new painting developed."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1905 and 1908, a conscious search for a new style caused rapid changes in art across France, Germany, Holland, Italy, and Russia. The Impressionists had used a double point of view, and both [[Les Nabis]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] (who also admired Cézanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms. [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] structure and subject matter, most notably to be seen in the works of [[Georges Seurat]] (e.g., ''Parade de Cirque'', ''[[Le Chahut]]'' and ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Le Cirque]]''), was another important influence. There were also parallels in the development of literature and social thought.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

In addition to Seurat, the roots of cubism are to be found in the two distinct tendencies of Cézanne's later work: first his breaking of the painted surface into small multifaceted areas of paint, thereby emphasizing the plural viewpoint given by [[binocular vision]], and second his interest in the simplification of natural forms into cylinders, spheres, and cones. However, the cubists explored this concept further than Cézanne. They represented all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single picture plane, as if the objects had all their faces visible at the same time. This new kind of depiction revolutionized the way objects could be visualized in painting and art.

Exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants, and published in Apollinaire's 1913 ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations]]''. Provenance: Jacques Nayral, [[Niels Bohr]]]]
The historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from sources of limited data, namely the opinions of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. It came to rely heavily on [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s book ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'' (published in 1920), which centered on the developments of Picasso, Braque, Léger, and Gris. The terms "analytical" and "synthetic" which subsequently emerged have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s. Both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify. Neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created. "If Kahnweiler considers Cubism as Picasso and Braque," wrote Daniel Robbins, "our only fault is in subjecting other Cubists' works to the rigors of that limited definition."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The traditional interpretation of "Cubism", formulated ''post facto'' as a means of understanding the works of Braque and Picasso, has affected our appreciation of other twentieth-century artists. It is difficult to apply to painters such as [[Jean Metzinger]], Albert Gleizes, [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], whose fundamental differences from traditional Cubism compelled Kahnweiler to question whether to call them Cubists at all. According to [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "To suggest that merely because these artists developed differently or varied from the traditional pattern they deserved to be relegated to a secondary or satellite role in Cubism is a profound mistake."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The history of the term "Cubism" usually stresses the fact that Matisse referred to "cubes" in connection with a painting by Braque in 1908, and that the term was published twice by the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in a similar context. However, the word "cube" was used in 1906 by another critic, Louis Chassevent, with reference not to Picasso or Braque but rather to Metzinger and Delaunay:

::"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. [[Paul Signac|Signac]] but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]".&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent, ''Les Artistes Indépendants, 1906'', Quelques Petits Salons. Paris, 1908. Chassevent discussed Delaunay and Metzinger in terms of Signac's influence, referring to Metzinger's "precision in the cut of his cubes..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical use of the word "cube" goes back at least to May 1901 when Jean Béral, reviewing the work of [[Henri-Edmond Cross]] at the Indépendants in ''Art et Littérature'', commented that he "uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. One even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter diversely colored: they would make pretty revetments." (Robert Herbert, 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;221)&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The term Cubism did not come into general usage until 1911, mainly with reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, and Léger.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; In 1911, the poet and critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the Brussels Indépendants. The following year, in preparation for the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]''&lt;ref&gt;A. Gleizes and J. Metzinger. Du "Cubisme", Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (Eng. trans., London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word, and as a major defence of Cubism (which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912 Salon d'Automne in Paris).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k201712x/f1.image Fritz-R.

The result, not solely a collaboration between its two authors, reflected discussions by the circle of artists who met in [[Puteaux]] and [[Courbevoie]]. It mirrored the attitudes of the "artists of Passy", which included Picabia and the Duchamp brothers, to whom sections of it were read prior to publication.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; The concept developed in ''Du "Cubisme"'' of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously, i.e., the act of moving around an object to seize it from several successive angles fused into a single image (multiple viewpoints, mobile perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity), is a generally recognized device used by the Cubists.&lt;ref name="David Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Cubism,+mobile+perspective&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm_znb7YtG&amp;sig=8jHfIJBskeVW31AU_0hqno0HLBY&amp;hl=fr#v=onepage&amp;q=Cubism%2C%20mobile%20perspective&amp;f=false David Cottington, 2004, ''Cubism and its Histories'', Manchester University Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101225927/https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Cubism,+mobile+perspective&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm_znb7YtG&amp;sig=8jHfIJBskeVW31AU_0hqno0HLBY&amp;hl=fr |date=2016-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1912 manifetso ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' by Metzinger and Gleizes was followed in 1913 by ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes]]'', a collection of reflections and commentaries by Guillaume Apollinaire.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire"&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Les Peintres cubistes: Méditations esthétiques'' (Paris, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; Apollinaire had been closely involved with Picasso beginning in 1905, and Braque beginning in 1907, but gave as much attention to artists such as Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Picabia, and Duchamp.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

{{main|Cubist sculpture}}

Just as in painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in Paul Cézanne's reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids (cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones). And just as in painting, it became a pervasive influence and contributed fundamentally to [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Futurism]].

Cubist sculpture developed in parallel to Cubist painting. During the autumn of 1909 Picasso sculpted ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'' with positive features depicted by negative space and vice versa. According to Douglas Cooper: "The first true Cubist sculpture was Picasso's impressive ''Woman's Head'', modeled in 1909–10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time."&lt;ref name="The Cubist Epoch" /&gt; These positive/negative reversals were ambitiously exploited by [[Alexander Archipenko]] in 1912–13, for example in ''Woman Walking''.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; [[Joseph Csaky]], after Archipenko, was the first sculptor in Paris to join the Cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onwards.

Indeed, Cubist construction was as influential as any pictorial Cubist innovation. It was the stimulus behind the proto-Constructivist work of both [[Naum Gabo]] and [[Vladimir Tatlin]] and thus the starting-point for the entire constructive tendency in 20th-century modernist sculpture.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

Cubism formed an important link between early-20th-century art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Blau &amp; Troy"&gt;[http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/projects/architecture-and-cubism-1.html Architecture and Cubism, Eve Blau, Nancy J.

Though there are many points of intersection between Cubism and architecture, only a few direct links between them can be drawn. Most often the connections are made by reference to shared formal characteristics: faceting of form, spatial ambiguity, transparency, and multiplicity.&lt;ref name="Blau &amp; Troy" /&gt;

Architectural interest in Cubism centered on the dissolution and reconstitution of three-dimensional form, using simple geometric shapes, juxtaposed without the illusions of classical perspective. Diverse elements could be superimposed, made transparent or penetrate one another, while retaining their spatial relationships. Cubism had become an influential factor in the development of modern architecture from 1912 (''La Maison Cubiste'', by [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[André Mare]]) onwards, developing in parallel with architects such as [[Peter Behrens]] and [[Walter Gropius]], with the simplification of building design, the use of materials appropriate to industrial production, and the increased use of glass.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020551#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, II.

Cubism was relevant to an architecture seeking a style that needed not refer to the past. Thus, what had become a revolution in both painting and sculpture was applied as part of "a profound reorientation towards a changed world".&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. R. Banham. Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (London, 1960), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubo-Futurist ideas of [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] influenced attitudes in avant-garde architecture. The influential [[De Stijl]] movement embraced the aesthetic principles of Neo-plasticism developed by [[Piet Mondrian]] under the influence of Cubism in Paris. De Stijl was also linked by [[Gino Severini]] to Cubist theory through the writings of Albert Gleizes. However, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of industrial application—which had been prefigured by Marcel Duchamp from 1914—was left to the founders of [[Purism (arts)|Purism]], [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (better known as [[Le Corbusier]],) who exhibited paintings together in Paris and published ''Après le cubisme'' in 1918.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture" /&gt; Le Corbusier's ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of Cubism to architecture. Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier concentrated his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, Le Corbusier and his cousin Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres. His theoretical studies soon advanced into many different architectural projects.&lt;ref&gt;Choay, Françoise, ''le corbusier'' (1960), pp. 10-11.

At the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as ''Maison Cubiste'' (Cubist House), signed [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[André Mare]] along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written during the assemblage of the "Maison Cubiste", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the "antithesis of the picture". "The true picture" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, "bears its ''raison d'être'' within itself. It can be moved from a church to a [[drawing-room]], from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinge, except from ''Du Cubisme'', 1912] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602141918/http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf |date=2013-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes Christopher Green, "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=%22maison+cubiste%22+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jv-hGOpwJc&amp;sig=0m8pM6Oi2mPGtmB6uB0Fe3s9YAQ&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22maison%20cubiste%22%201912&amp;f=false Christopher Green, ''Art in France: 1900-1940, Chapter 8, Modern Spaces; Modern Objects; Modern People, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130140743/https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=%22maison+cubiste%22+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jv-hGOpwJc&amp;sig=0m8pM6Oi2mPGtmB6uB0Fe3s9YAQ&amp;hl=en |date=2016-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Maison Cubiste'' was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the ''Salon Bourgeois'', where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (''Woman with a Fan''), Gleizes, Laurencin and Léger were hung—and a bedroom.

===Czech Cubist architecture===
[[File:Dům U černé Matky Boží 02.JPG|thumb|[[House of the Black Madonna]] in Prague, built by [[Josef Gočár]] in 1912]]
The original Cubist architecture is very rare. There is only one country in the world where Cubism was really applied to architecture – namely [[Bohemia]] (today [[Czech Republic]]) and especially its capital, [[Prague]].&lt;ref name=bonek&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boněk|first1=Jan|title=Cubist Prague|date=2014|publisher=Eminent|location=Prague|isbn=978-80-7281-469-5|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cztourism&gt;{{cite web|title=Cubism|url=https://www.czechtourism.com/p/cubism-editorial/|website=www.czechtourism.com|publisher=CzechTourism|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016060851/https://www.czechtourism.com/p/cubism-editorial/|archivedate=16 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech architects were the first and only ones in the world to ever design original Cubist buildings.&lt;ref name=radioprague&gt;{{cite web|title=Cubist architecture|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/static/inventors/cubism|website=www.radio.cz|publisher=Radio Prague|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911055421/http://www.radio.cz/en/static/inventors/cubism|archivedate=11 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubist architecture flourished for the most part between 1910–1914, but the Cubist or Cubism-influenced buildings were also built after the [[World War I]]. After the war, the architectural style called ''Rondo-Cubism'' was developed in Prague fusing the Cubist architecture with round shapes.&lt;ref name=czkubista&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech Cubism|url=http://www.kubista.cz/en/cubism/profiles.html#|website=www.kubista.cz|publisher=Kubista|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008123014/http://www.kubista.cz/en/cubism/profiles.html|archivedate=8 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:104 Vil·la Kovařovic (casa cubista), façana de Rašínovo Nábřeží.jpg|thumb|Villa Kovařovic in Prague by [[Josef Chochol]]]]
In their theoretical rules, the Cubist architects expressed the requirement of dynamism, which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it, through a creative idea, so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer. This should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms, by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called [[diamond cut]], or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late [[Gothic architecture]]. In this way, the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted. The grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form. Thus, new forms of windows and doors were also created, e. g. [[hexagonal window]]s.&lt;ref name=czkubista/&gt; Czech Cubist architects also designed Cubist furniture.

The leading Cubist architects were [[Pavel Janák]], [[Josef Gočár]], [[Vlastislav Hofman]], [[Emil Králíček]] and [[Josef Chochol]].&lt;ref name=czkubista/&gt; They worked mostly in Prague but also in other Bohemian towns. The best-known Cubist building is the [[House of the Black Madonna]] in the [[Old Town of Prague]] built in 1912 by Josef Gočár with the only Cubist café in the world, Grand Café Orient.&lt;ref name=bonek/&gt; Vlastislav Hofman built the entrance pavilions of [[Ďáblice cemetery|Ďáblice Cemetery]] in 1912–1914, Josef Chochol designed several residential houses under [[Vyšehrad]]. A Cubist streetlamp has also been preserved near the [[Wenceslas Square]], designed by Emil Králíček in 1912, who also built the Diamond House in the [[New Town of Prague]] around 1913.

==Cubism in other fields==
The influence of cubism extended to other artistic fields, outside painting and sculpture. In literature, the written works of [[Gertrude Stein]] employ repetition and repetitive phrases as building blocks in both passages and whole chapters. Most of Stein's important works utilize this technique, including the novel ''[[The Making of Americans]]'' (1906–08). Not only were they the first important patrons of Cubism, Gertrude Stein and her brother [[Leo Stein|Leo]] were also important influences on Cubism as well. Picasso in turn was an important influence on Stein's writing.

In the field of American fiction, [[William Faulkner]]'s 1930 novel ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' can be read as an interaction with the cubist mode. The novel features narratives of the diverse experiences of 15 characters which, when taken together, produce a single cohesive body.

The poets generally associated with Cubism are [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Max Jacob]], [[André Salmon]] and [[Pierre Reverdy]]. As American poet [[Kenneth Rexroth]] explains, Cubism in poetry "is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made self-sufficient by its rigorous architecture. This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kenneth Rexroth |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/essays/reverdy.htm |title=The Cubist Poetry of Pierre Reverdy (Rexroth) |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519035242/http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/essays/reverdy.htm |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Cubist poets' influence on both Cubism and the later movements of [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] was profound; [[Louis Aragon]], founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, Éluard and himself, Reverdy was "our immediate elder, the exemplary poet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reverdy |first=Pierre |url=http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 |title=Title Page &gt; Pierre Reverdy: Selected Poems |publisher=Bloodaxe Books |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527200900/http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets [[John Ashbery]] and [[Ron Padgett]] have recently produced new translations of [[Pierre Reverdy|Reverdy's]] work. [[Wallace Stevens]]' "[[Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird]]" is also said to demonstrate how cubism's multiple perspectives can be translated into poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070813070622/http://titan.iwu.edu/~wchapman/americanpoetryweb/stevthir.html Illinois Wesleyan University - The American Poetry Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7890">'''David Louis Mearns''', O.A.M., M.Sc., (born 10 August 1958), is an [[United States|American]]-born [[United Kingdom]] based marine scientist and [[Oceanography|Oceanographer]], who specializes in deep water search and recovery operations, and the discovery of the location of historic ship wrecks.

==Early life==
Mearns was raised in [[Weehawken, New Jersey]], where he attended [[Weehawken High School]], graduating in 1976. He subsequently graduated [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] in Marine Biology from [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] in 1980, and obtained a [[Master of Science|Masters]] degree in Marine Geology from the [[University of South Florida]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Hague|Hague, Jim]]. [http://www.hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/2376595/article-Weehawken-native-finds-HMS-Hood-on-ocean-s-floor-Mearns--six-year-journey-ends-with-mixed-emotions--leads-to-documentary--book?instance-search_results "Weehawken native finds HMS Hood on ocean's floor Mearns' six-year journey ends with mixed emotions; leads to documentary, book"], ''[[The Hudson Reporter]]'', November 9, 2001. Accessed December 29, 2016. "When David Mearns was a youngster growing up in Weehawken, he was always fascinated by water.... Upon graduating from Weehawken High School in 1976, Mearns headed to Fairleigh Dickinson University to major in marine biology. He graduated in 1980 after studying in St. Croix in the Virgin Islands for a semester, then headed to graduate school at the University of South Florida in Tampa."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanographic career==
From 1986 to 1995 Mearns was employed in the commercial undersea surveying industry in a managerial capacity. In 1990 he worked on the criminal investigation into the foundering of the [[cargo ship|freighter]] ''[[Lucona]]'', and in 1994 located the wreck of the [[ore-bulk-oil carrier]] {{MV|Derbyshire}}. Relocating to [[England]] in the mid 1990s, he established ''Blue Water Recoveries, Limited'', a commercial company that locates and researches historic deep-sea shipwrecks across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Entry (dated 2017) for Mearns on the Linkedin professional profile website.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]] high seas confrontation between the naval forces of the [[British Empire]] and [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], Mearns successfully led an expedition funded by [[Channel 4 Television]] to locate and film on the seabed of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] the wrecks of the Royal Navy flagship [[HMS Hood|H.M.S ''Hood'']], and its nemesis, [[German battleship Bismarck]]. An extended television documentary entitled ''The Hunt for the Hood'' was produced from the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;IMDb entry for 'The Hunt for the Hood'. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318884/&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
Blue Water Recoveries Ltd. holds three [[Guinness World Records]], including one for the deepest shipwreck ever found, the German [[blockade runner]] ''Rio Grande'', which was located at a depth of {{Convert|5762|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;A.B.C. (Australia) Report, 'The Hunt for H.M.A.S. Sydney', April 2008. http://www.abc.net.au/tv/hmassydney/whosinvd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Mearns [[Search for HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|led a search team to find]] the [[Australia]]n cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|D48|6}} and the German auxiliary cruiser [[German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|''Kormoran'']], which both sank following a [[Battle between HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|engagement]] off of [[Western Australia]] in 1941 during World War 2. Prior to finding H.M.A.S. ''Sydney'', Mearns said that it was, in some ways, "bigger than the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''" because of what it meant to Australia. "Nothing comes close to the ''Sydney''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20741311-2,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905153042/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20741311-2,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-05 |title='I'll find HMAS Sydney' |date=2006-11-12 |accessdate=2008-09-01 |publisher=Sunday Telegraph |work=news.com.au }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of 2010, he successfully led the search for another missing Australian shipwreck, the Hospital Ship [[AHS Centaur|''Centaur'']], which was torpedoed off [[Queensland]] by a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] submarine in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/discovery-proves-maligned-navigator-gordon-rippon-got-it-right/story-e6frg6nf-1225812246120 |title=Discovery proves maligned navigator got it right |last=Fraser |first=Andrew |date=21 December 2009 |work=The Australian |page=3 |accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 November 2010, Mearns was awarded an honorary [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] in recognition of his work in locating and analyzing the wrecks of H.M.A.S. ''Sydney'' and A.H.S. ''Centaur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/shipwreck-finder-gets-honorary-order-of-australia.htm |title=Shipwreck finder gets honorary OAM |last=Smith |first=Aaron |date=4 November 2010 |work=Australian Geographic |accessdate=5 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106075341/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/shipwreck-finder-gets-honorary-order-of-australia.htm |archivedate=6 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2015 Mearns was part of a team led by [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]] which located the wreck of the Japanese battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Musashi|Musashi]]'' in the [[Sibuyan Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-sunken-japan-wwii-warship-musashi-paul-allen-research-team/|title=Live video feed of sunken Japan WWII warship Musashi by Paul Allen research team|date=13 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2015, Mearns jointly announced with the Ministry of Heritage &amp; Culture of the Government of [[Oman]] the discovery of a shipwreck from [[Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama's]] 1502-1503 Armada to India. The wreck is believed to be the Portuguese ''nau Esmeralda'' that was commanded by Vicente Sodré the maternal uncle of Vasco da Gama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esmeraldashipwreck.com|title=Vasco da Gama shipwreck Esmeralda near Oman from Vasco da Gama fleet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having sunk in May 1503, the ''Esmeralda'' is believed to be the earliest ship from Europe's Age of Discovery ever to be found and excavated by archaeologists. Mearns published a paper, with co-authors D. Parham and B. Frohlich, on the discovery in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mearns|first1=David|title=A Portuguese East Indiaman from the 1502–1503 Fleet of Vasco da Gama off Al Hallaniyah Island, Oman: an interim report|journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=14 March 2016|volume=46|issue=2|pages=1–21|doi=10.1111/1095-9270.12175|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1095-9270.12175/full|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Limes4-en.png|thumb|300px|right|The "Limes Sarmatiae", "Devil's Dyke" or "Devil's Ditch" in eastern [[Pannonia|Pannonian plain]], a group of lines of Roman fortifications done by [[Constantine I]]]]
{{Ancient Rome military sidebar}}

The '''Devil's Dykes''' (Hungarian: '''''Ördög árok'''''), also known as the '''''Csörsz árka''''' ("Csörsz Ditch") or the '''''Limes Sarmatiae''''' (Latin for "Sarmatian border"), are several lines of Roman fortifications built mostly during the reign of [[Constantine I]] (312–337), stretching between today's [[Hungary]], [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]].

==History==

The fortifications consisted of a series of defensive earthen ramparts-and-ditches surrounding the plain of the ''Tisia'' ([[Tisza]]) river. They stretched from [[Aquincum]] (within modern [[Budapest]]) eastwards along the line of the northern [[Carpathian]] mountains to the vicinity of [[Debrecen]], and then southwards to [[Viminacium]] (near modern [[Stari Kostolac]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://terinformatika-online.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=157&amp;Itemid=84  Devil's Dykes essays with photos (in Hungarian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721113347/http://terinformatika-online.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=157&amp;Itemid=84 |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were probably designed to protect the [[Iazyges]], a [[Sarmatian]] tribe that inhabited the Tisza plain and had been reduced to tributary status by Constantine, from incursions by the surrounding [[Goths]] and [[Gepids]].&lt;ref&gt;Penguin Atlas 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements of the fortifications, however, date from the 2nd century AD, and probably constituted an earlier defensive line constructed under emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (ruled 161–80) at the time of the [[Marcomannic Wars]], the previous occasion that the Tisza plain was occupied by the Romans.

The "Limes Sarmatiae" was intended to expand the [[Roman Limes]], and was built at the same time as the [[Brazda lui Novac|Constantine Wall]] in [[Wallachia]] (connected to the [[Limes Moesiae]]). It was, however, destroyed after a few years, at the end of the 4th century.

Indeed, in 374 AD, the [[Quadi]], a Germanic tribe in what is now [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]], resenting the erection of [[Roman forts]] of the "Limes Sarmatiae" to the north and east of the Danube in what they considered to be their own territory, and further exasperated by the treacherous murder of their king, Gabinius, crossed the river and laid waste the province of [[Pannonia]].

The emperor [[Valentinian I]] in 375 Ad entered Pannonia with a powerful army and reinforced the fortifications of the "Limes Sarmatiae". But during an audience to an embassy from the Quadi (who were quickly defeated by the Roman legions) at Brigetio on the Danube (in Slovakia), Valentinian I suffered a burst blood vessel in the skull while angrily yelling at the people gathered. This injury resulted in his death on November of that year.

Soon after his death, and following a lack of ruling power inside the [[Roman Empire]], the "Limes Sarmatiae" was destroyed.

'''Duncan McCargo''' is Professor of Political Science at the [[University of Leeds]]. Since the beginning of 2015, he has held a shared appointment at [[Columbia University]], where he is a Visiting Professor of Political Science and teaches every spring semester.  McCargo is also a visiting scholar at the [[Weatherhead East Asian Institute]], [[Columbia University]], and an associate fellow of the New-York-based [[Asia Society]].  He holds three degrees from the [[University of London]]: a First in English ([[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]] 1986); an MA in Area Studies ([[Southeast Asia]]) (1990); and a PhD in Politics (1993) (both graduate degrees from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]). He has also taught at [[Queen's University, Belfast]], and at [[Kobe Gakuin University]], [[Japan]]. In 2006-07, he was a visiting senior research fellow at the Asia Research Institute, [[National University of Singapore]]. He served as a distinguished visiting professor at [[Universiti Utara Malaysia]] in September 2011. During the 2015-16 academic year, he was a Visitor at the School of Social Science, [[Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton]].

McCargo is best known for his  writing on contemporary [[Thailand]] and [[Asia]]-related topics. His work deals mainly with the nature of power: how entrenched elites seek to retain it, and how challengers seek to undermine their legitimacy.

==Writings on Thailand==
McCargo's PhD thesis, ''The political leadership of Major-General [[Chamlong Srimuang]]'' was published in a revised form as a 1997 book. Since then McCargo has published several other books on Thailand. These include: ''Politics and the Press in Thailand'' (2000), a fieldwork-based study for which he spent a year embedded in the editorial rooms of several leading Thai language newspapers; ''Reforming Thai Politics'' (2002) an edited volume which has become the standard work on the political reform process of the 1990s, containing chapters by a range of leading Thai and foreign scholars and activists; and ''The Thaksinization of Thailand'', a widely cited analysis of the politics surrounding controversial former prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], co-authored with the revisionist political economist Ukrist Pathamanand.

Apart from his ten books, all of which have appeared in paperback, McCargo has published a number of articles in journals including ''Critical Asian Studies'', ''[[Journal of Asian Studies]]'', ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'' and ''[[New Left Review]]''. His writings regarding the "network monarchy", a term he coined to describe King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] and his proxies, particularly former Prime Minister [[Prem Tinsulanond]], have been influential among Thai academics. His was the only journal article selected by ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' for their seven-item list of essential reading on Thai politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhonta|first1=Erik|title=What to Read on Thai Politics
|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=2009-07-07|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/thailand/2009-07-07/what-read-thai-politics|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other McCargo articles deal critically with issues such as constitutionalism, the politics surrounding [[Buddhism]], and the role of the military. He was critical of the [[2006 Thailand coup|2006 and 2014 military coups]] in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCargo|first1=Duncan|title=Toxic Thaksin|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=2006-09-27|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2006-09-27/toxic-thaksin|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCargo's work forms by now a basis of Thai studies, as evidenced by his many publications, awards and appointments mentioned here. At the same time, all of McCargo's work on Thailand and Southeast Asia forms part of his larger intellectual project on the nature of power and justice, which has a broad comparative reach.

==Work on the southern Thai conflict==
From 2005 to 2010, McCargo worked primarily on the violent conflict affecting Thailand's southern border provinces, spending a year driving around the region and interviewing more than 270 informants. His southern Thai project produced three books: the edited collection ''Rethinking Thailand’s Southern Violence'' (2007), which is based on a 2006 special issue of the journal ''Critical Asian Studies''; the research monograph ''Tearing Apart the Land: Islam and Legitimacy in Southern Thailand'' (2008); and a second monograph, ''Mapping National Anxieties: Thailand's Southern Conflict'' in 2012. In the same year, a Thai translation of ''Tearing Apart the Land'' was published by Kobfai.

''Tearing Apart the Land'' has been widely reviewed; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote, "No armchairs for this author: he researched the book by crisscrossing southern Thailand in a temperamental 1989 Mercedes, hastening back to the town of [[Pattani]] by nightfall to avoid militant booby traps. McCargo is the real McCoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall |first=Andrew |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1891616,00.html |title=Books: Anatomy of a Forgotten Conflict |publisher=Time |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Pacific Affairs]]'' wrote of ''Tearing Apart the Land:'' "The nuances and complexities of this argument can be obtained only by a thorough reading of the book. It is by far the best analysis to date of the complexities of life in the insurgent area." (Volume 82, No. 4 – Winter 2009/2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;740–41). In a full length review essay in [[London Review of Books]], [[Joshua Kurlantzick]] declared, "Thailand, once known as one of the most stable democracies in Asia, is in political and economic crisis....Southern Thailand now resembles a war zone....McCargo gives a thorough explanation of why unrest began in southern Thailand, and why it has spread..." (25 March 2010). Reviewing the book in the ''Journal of Asian Studies'' (May 1010) Robert W. Hefner wrote, "McCargo has sifted through the details of this tragic conflict with extraordinary diligence and insight. The result is a small masterpiece of investigative rigor and balance."{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

McCargo's core argument is that the southern conflict is a political problem. Militants tap into local resentment concerning Bangkok's refusal to grant the region any real say in the management of its affairs. Without some form of political compromise, the conflict may prove intractable, but a solution remains perfectly possible.

''Tearing Apart the Land'' won the Asia Society's inaugural Bernard Schwartz Book Prize for 2009, worth US$20,000. Jury co-chair Professor [[Carol Gluck]] described it as a "vivid on-the-ground account of the Thai insurgency showing how national politics, rather than minority religion, drives the violence that is too often ascribed either to ethnicity or Islam. This is a lesson that applies not only to Southeast Asia but to many parts of the world."

==Writings on other Asian countries==

McCargo has also edited a book on [[Vietnam]] (2004). His book ''Contemporary Japan'' (third edition 2013) is widely assigned even by Japanologists as an introductory student text, and has been translated into Malaysian, Chinese and Korean.

==Writings on media and politics==
Not all of McCargo's work has been on Thailand. He has also conducted research in [[Cambodia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Japan]]. His 2003 book ''Media and Politics in Pacific Asia'', a companion volume to his Thai press book, develops a comparative argument, arguing against simply "modelling" the political role of the media, in favour of an eclectic approach emphasising the different forms of agency deployed by media actors, which he terms "partisan polyvalence". His media work has won him an audience in the field of communications studies, whose standard assumptions he regularly challenges. In 2012 he published a chapter in ''Comparing Media Systems: Beyond the Western World'', a book edited by Dan Hallin and Paolo Mancini. The chapter contains his critical responses to their earlier comparative work on developing models for the relationship between media and politics.

==Writings on religion and politics==
Religion has been a central theme of McCargo's work, dating back to his doctoral research on Chamlong's links with the [[Santi Asoke]] Buddhist movement. His writings on Thai Buddhism, which he claims is an obstacle to, rather than an asset for processes of democratization in the country, have generated controversy, and have been extensively challenged in two books by the leading scholar-monk [[Prayudh Payutto]]. His work on the southern Thai conflict dealt extensively with the role of Islam in Thailand's Malay-majority region.

==Writings on justice and politics==

McCargo's recent work has been primarily on issues relating to politics and justice. Between 2011 and 2014, he held a [[Leverhulme Trust]] major research fellowship to examine issues relating to justice and politics in Thailand, from which he has published a number of articles. McCargo spent 2012 conducting fieldwork in Thailand, including participant-observation in courts and police stations; his primary focus is on a number of politically-related court cases brought since 2006. He has also written critical examinations of transitional justice initiatives, both in Southeast Asia and more broadly. His theoretical approach draws on critiques of legalism and constitutionalism as applied - or mis-applied - to the solution of deep-rooted political problems or conflicts.

==Urbanized villagers==

In 2011, McCargo published an influential article with his former PhD student Naruemon Thabchumpon in which they coined the term "urbanized villagers", to describe the socio-economic basis of the pro-Thaksin redshirt movement. They argue that the bedrock of the redshirts comprises "poor farmers" who are really neither poor nor farmers: though legally resident in provinces of the North and Northeast, they derive most their income from selling their labor and running small businesses, often in the greater Bangkok area.  Former prime minister Thaksin succeeded in capturing the loyalty of this group by persuading them that he was working on behalf of their economic and political interests. The phenomenon found in Thailand, whereby a traditional elite allied with a metropolitan middle class finds itself threatened and outnumbered by the rise of urbanized villagers, can be seen in many other countries. In another co-authored article, McCargo has compared the social structure of Thailand with that of Turkey.

==Other activities==
As a leading expert on contemporary Thailand, McCargo regularly appears as a media commentator, pundit, and writer of op-ed pieces. He appears regularly in the broadcast media, especially on [[BBC]] radio and television, and his op-ed and commentary pieces have appeared in ''Time'' magazine, as well as in the ''[[Guardian Weekly]],'' ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCargo|first1=Duncan|title=Bangkok's savage conflict may be a mere dress rehearsal|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/7738887/Bangkoks-savage-conflict-may-be-a-mere-dress-rehearsal.html|accessdate=3 August 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]],''&lt;ref&gt;‘Enemies of the people’, The Economist, 30 July 2010 http://www.economist.com/node/16703377?story_id=16703377&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCargo|first1=Duncan|title=Thai protests: military crackdown only widens divide| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/19/thailand-redshirt-protests-military-crackdown|work=The Guardian|date=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCargo|first1=Duncan|title=Thailand protests may prove royal words are no longer enough|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/17/analysis-thai-king-redshirt-protest|accessdate=3 August 2015|work=The Guardian|issue=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCargo|first1=Duncan|title=Thaksin's long shadow|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/03/thailand|work=The Guardian|accessdate=3 August 2015|date=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Independent]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCargo|first1=Duncan|title=Thailand is deeply fractured and anarchy has come closer|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/duncan-mccargo-thailand-is-deeply-fractured-and-anarchy-has-come-closer-1973961.html|accessdate=3 August 2015|work=The Independent|date=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Financial Times]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and a dozen other newspapers around the world. He has given lengthy interviews to ''The'' ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' and the New Mandala website. Twenty-three of his students have successfully earned PhDs under his supervision at Leeds.

McCargo is cited by his undergraduate alma mater, [[Royal Holloway]], as one of their notable alumni in the field of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhul.ac.uk/alumni/ouralumni/notablealumni.aspx |accessdate=December 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229153533/http://www.rhul.ac.uk/alumni/ouralumni/notablealumni.aspx |archivedate=December 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer was recipient of numerous awards, including over 140 honorary doctorates.

==Early life and education==
Boyer was born on September 13, 1928 in [[Dayton, Ohio]], to Clarence and Ethel Boyer.
He was one of three males in his family. His father worked in the basement of their home managing a wholesale book store and running a mail-order greeting-card and office-supply. William Boyer, Ernest’s paternal grandfather, was said to be the most influential figure in his younger years. William Boyer was head of the Dayton Mission of the [[Brethren in Christ Church]] and directed Ernest toward "a people-centered life." He taught Ernest, primarily through his own life, that service to others was a high calling and obligation. Boyer believed deeply in the connectedness of all things. That was a primary reason why he would later propose the connection of teaching, service, and research in ''Scholarship Reconsidered.'' He worried the research had trumped the roles of teaching and service in the university, and faculty roles were lesser for it. This concern was shared by Abraham Flexner, who worked for Carnegie nearly a hundred years earlier.

Boyer attended [[Messiah College]] where he met his future wife and the mother of his four children, Kathryn Garis Tyson; in
subsequent years, he would return to Messiah to serve as chairman and as a member of its board of trustees.
After two years at Messiah College he transferred to and graduated from [[Greenville College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He began graduate studies at the [[Ohio State University]], but left for the [[University of Southern California]], where he earned his [[master's]] and [[doctoral]] degrees. He was a post-doctoral member in medical audiology at the [[University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics|University of Iowa Hospital]].

Boyer taught and served in administrative posts at [[Loyola Marymount University]], [[Upland College]] and the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]]. At Upland College, he introduced the idea of a program that would give students a period in which they would not attend class during the mid-year term, and the students would take on individual projects. When he was at Upland, he decided that he wanted to devote his career to educational administration.

In 1965, he moved east to join the [[State University of New York]] system as its first executive [[Dean (education)|dean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Carter's Education Nominee; Ernest Leroy Boyer | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1977-03-16 | page=B5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He became [[Chancellor]] of the institution five years later.

In his seven-year term, he founded the [[Empire State College]] at [[Saratoga Springs]] and four other locations as non-campus SUNY schools in which adults could study for degrees without attending classes. He also set up an experimental three-year [[Bachelor of Arts]] program; established a new rank, Distinguished Teaching Professor, to reward faculty members of educational distinction as well as research, and established one of the first student-exchange programs with the [[Soviet Union]].

Dr. Boyer served on commissions to advise President [[Richard M. Nixon]] and President [[Gerald R. Ford]]. In 1977, he was appointed by President [[Jimmy Carter]] to lead the United States as [[U.S. Commissioner of Education|Commissioner of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Boyer, State U. Head, Named U.S. Education Commissioner; Black Lawyer to Lead Army | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1977-01-20 | page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of the [[Carter Administration]], Dr. Boyer followed Alan Pifer as president of the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]]. He expanded his position to go beyond the study of higher education bringing more attention to education at every level with concentration on the earliest years of a child’s education.  He served the Foundation from 1979 to his death in 1995. Dr. Boyer died on December 8, 1995. During his valiant three-year struggle with [[cancer]], he never stopped working. He took telephone calls the day before he died.

==Reports==
One of Boyer's major accomplishments was creating a dialogue between teachers and administrators about teaching methods and programs. He wrote many reports that changed the face of education during his time at the Carnegie Foundation. Boyer addressed issues of secondary and primary education and created discussions about issues in education reform.

After working on a fifteen-month study of the nation’s high schools, Boyer wrote ''High School: A Report on Secondary Education in America (1983).'' Boyer recommended adopting a "[[Curriculum#Core curriculum|core curriculum]]" for all students and tougher [[foreign language]] and English requirements. He stressed the need for [[community service]] before graduation and excellence for all students and teachers.

Boyer's next report, stated how many faculty members of [[undergraduate]] institutions put more emphasis on research than on actual teaching. His report ''College: The Undergraduate Experience in America,'' was published in 1987. Boyer declared that the students were not getting the full attention of their instructors, stressing the importance of directing more resources into undergraduate education programs, expanding orientation and faculty mentoring for new students, and creating community service programs for students. Boyer connects teachers with students and professors in both high school and college on a more personal basis. Community service programs with high schools and college benefit all who are involved.

''Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professoriate'' challenged the then current views of faculty priorities and the true meaning of [[scholarship]]. Boyer classified four kinds of scholarship: discovery, integration, application, and teaching. This report has created debates around the country and has influenced many colleges and universities to evaluate their faculty differently.

In ''Ready to Learn: A Mandate for the Nation (1991)'', Boyer makes a strong point about the importance of preparing young children for school. Education of the parents of [[preschool]]ers was essential so that they might know "all of the forces that have such a profound impact on the children's lives and shape their readiness to learn." This study led to landmark legislation such as the Ready to Learn Act of 1994.

In 1995 the Carnegie Foundation published, ''The Basic School: A Community for Learning.'' This report talked about the importance of the first years of formal learning. The main point of the report was to help the public understand that the school is a community with a vision, "teachers as leaders and parents as partners." He also wanted a "powerful voice for the arts in education." This report led to the Basic School Network. The trial program was made up of sixteen schools, [[state school|public]] and [[private school|private]]. Boyer worked with school administrators and staff on the beliefs of the Basic School. This included new ways to create a curriculum, the importance of language and the arts, and the involvement of parents. The Basic School Network now has centers and affiliates around the country and is successful in improving elementary education.

An '''explanatory combinatorial dictionary''' (ECD) is a type of monolingual [[dictionary]] designed to be part of a [[Meaning-text theory|meaning-text]] linguistic model of a natural language.&lt;ref&gt; Mel’čuk, Igor A. (2006). Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary. In Giandomenico Sica (ed.), Open Problems in Linguistics and Lexicography, 225–355. Monza: Polimetrica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Jennifer. 1998 Terms in Context. Amsterdam: John Benjamins 76–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fontenelle, Thierry. (2008) Using a bilingual dictionary to create semantic networks. In Thierry Fontenelle (ed.), Practical Lexicography: A reader, 175. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to be a complete record of the lexicon of a given language.&lt;ref&gt;Frawley, William. (1988). New Forms of Specialized Dictionaries. International Journal of Lexicography 1, 189–213.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, it identifies and describes, in separate entries, each of the language's [[lexeme]]s (roughly speaking, each word or set of inflected forms based on a single stem) and [[phraseme]]s (roughly speaking, idioms and other multi-word fixed expressions). Among other things, each entry contains (1) a definition that incorporates a lexeme's semantic actants (for example, the definiendum of ''give'' takes the form ''X gives Y to Z'', where its three actants are expressed —  the giver ''X'', the thing given ''Y'', and the person given to, ''Z'') (2) complete information on lexical co-occurrence (e.g. the entry for ''attack'' tells you that one of its collocations is ''launch an attack'', the entry for ''party'' provides ''throw a party'', and the entry for ''lecture'' provides ''deliver a lecture'' — enabling the user to avoid making an error like *''deliver a party''); (3) an extensive set of examples. The ECD is a production dictionary — that is, it aims to provide all the information needed for a foreign learner or automaton to produce perfectly formed utterances of the language. Since the lexemes and phrasemes of a natural language number in the hundreds of thousands, a complete ECD, in paper form, would occupy the space of a large encyclopaedia. Such a work has yet to be achieved; while ECDs of Russian and French have been published, each describes less than one percent of the vocabulary of the respective languages.

The ECD was proposed in the late 1960s by Aleksandr Žolkovskij and [[Igor Mel'čuk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Žolkovskij|first=Aleksandr|author2=Igor A.

DeCesaris García|editor1-last=Bataner|pages=149–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of an ECD==
A complete ECD of a language would provide an entry for every lexeme, [[Construction grammar|construction]], or idiom—referred to collectively as "Lexical Units" (LUs)—in use in the language. Entries in the ECD are based on the semantic definition of an LU, and each entry contains a complete list of its [[Phraseme#Collocations|collocations]] and [[lexical functions]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;Frawley, William. (1988). New Forms of Specialized Dictionaries. International Journal of Lexicography 1, 189–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Entries for historically-related Lexical Units which are homophones and share significant semantic component (i.e., meanings) are grouped into larger units called "vocables," thereby acknowledging [[polysemy]] while maintaining the distinct status of the independent items in question. The English vocable ''improve'', for example, includes six Lexical Units, each of which is provided a separate lexical entry:

&lt;big&gt;'''IMPROVE'''&lt;/big&gt;, verb&lt;br /&gt;
:IMPROVE'''I.1a''' X improves ≡ ‘The value or the quality of X becomes higher’
::[''The weather suddenly improved; The system will improve over time'']
:IMPROVE'''I.1b''' X improves Y ≡ ‘X causes&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that Y improves'''I.1a'''’
::[''The most recent changes drastically improved the system'']
:IMPROVE'''I.2''' X improves ≡ ‘The health of a sick person X improves'''I.1a'''’
::[''Jim is steadily improving'']
:IMPROVE'''I.3''' X improves at Y ≡ ‘X’s execution of Y improves'''I.1a''', which is caused&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by X’s having practiced or practicing Y’
::[''Jim is steadily improving at algebra'']
:IMPROVE'''II''' X improves Y by Z-ing ≡ ‘X voluntarily causes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that the market value of a piece of real estate Y becomes higher by doing Z-ing to Y’
::[''Jim improved his house by installing indoor plumbing'']
:IMPROVE'''III''' X improves upon Y ≡ ‘X creates a new Y´ by improving'''I.1b''' Y’
::[''Jim has drastically improved upon Patrick’s translation'']
The lexicographic numbers (given in bold after the entry word) reflect degrees or levels of semantic distance between Lexical Units within a vocable: Roman numerals mark the highest-level semantic groupings, while Arabic numerals mark the next highest level, and letters indicate the lowest level distances. The four lexemes grouped under IMPROVE'''I''', for example, are considered to be closer to each other than to IMPROVE'''II''' or IMPROVE'''III''', because the meanings of each of IMPROVE'''I.1b''' and IMPROVE'''I.2''' actually include the meaning of IMPROVE'''I.1a'''. IMPROVE'''I.1a''' and IMPROVE'''I.1b''' are even more closely related because in English there are many pairs of words—specifically, labile or [[ambitransitive]] verbs—that are related by the semantic alternation ’P’ ~ ‘cause&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to P’ (as per above, ‘improve’ ~ ‘cause to improve’).

The [[subscript and superscript]] numbers attached to words in the definition refer to subsenses (subscripts) and homophonous entries (superscripts) for a word as given in the ''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English|year=1978|publisher=Longman|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; —thus, “device&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;” refers to the first entry for ''device'' in this dictionary, first subsense.

==Structure of the ECD entry==
An ECD entry for a given Lexical Unit, let’s call it "L", is divided into three major sections or "zones":

===The semantic zone===
The semantic zone describes the semantic properties of L and consists of two sub-zones: 
:1) the definition of L, which fully specifies L’s meaning; and 
:2) L’s connotations (meanings that the language associates with L, but that are not part of its definition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iordanskaja|first=Lida|author2=Igor A. Mel’čuk|title=Connotation en sémantique et lexicographie|journal=Dictionnaire explicatif et combinatoire du français contemporain : Recherches lexico-sémantiques I|year=1984|pages=33–40|publisher=Presses de l'Université de Montréal|location=Montréal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iordanskaja|first=Lida|author2=Igor A. Mel’čuk|title=Connotation|journal=The Slavic Languages: An International Handbook of their History, their Structure and their Investigation|year=2006|editor1-first=T., K. Gutschmidt, S. Kempgen &amp; P. Kosta|editor1-last=Berger|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The phonological/graphematic zone===
The phonological/graphematic zone gives all of the data on L’s phonological properties. Here again we find two sub-zones: 
:1) L’s pronunciation, including its syllabification, and any non-standard prosodic properties;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apresjan|first=Jurij |title=Tipy leksikografičeskoj informacii ob označajuščem leksemy [Types of Lexicographic Information on a Lexeme’s Signifier]|journal=Tipologija i grammatika|year=1990|pages=91–108|publisher=Nauka|location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 
:2) orthographic information about L’s spelling variants, etc.

===The co-occurrence zone===
The co-occurrence zone presents all of the data on L’s combinatorial properties. It is organized into five sub-zones—morphological, syntactic, lexical, stylistic, and pragmatic. 
:The '''morphological sub-zone''' contains inflectional data including conjugation/declension class, irregular forms, missing forms, permitted alternations, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apresjan|first=Juirj | title=Morfologičeskaja informacija dlja tolkovogo slovarja [Morphological Information in a Monolingual Dictionary]|journal=Slovarnye kategorii|year=1988|pages=31–59|editor1-first=Jurij|editor1-last=Karaulov|publisher=Nauka|location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:The '''syntactic sub-zone''' has two parts:
:: a) Government pattern, which describes the elements that L can syntactically govern (arguments, complements, etc.);
:: b) Part of speech and syntactic features, which describes the constructions in which L can appear as a syntactic [[Dependency grammar|dependent]].
:The '''lexical sub-zone''' specifies the [[lexical functions]] that L participates in, covering both semantic [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivations]] and [[Phraseme#Collocations|collocations]] of L with other individual LUs or very small and irregular groups of LUs. 
:The '''stylistic sub-zone''' specifies L’s speech register (informal, colloquial, vulgar, poetic, etc.), temporal (obsolescent, archaic) and geographical (British, Indian, Australian) variability, and the like. 
:The '''pragmatic sub-zone''' describes the real-life situations in which a particular expression is appropriate or inappropriate.

The '''Fitzwilliam Museum''' is the art and antiquities [[museum]] of the [[University of Cambridge]], located on [[Trumpington Street]] opposite Fitzwilliam Street in central [[Cambridge]], [[England]]. Admission is free.

The museum is the lead museum for the [[University of Cambridge Museums]] consortium, one of 16 Major Partner Museum services funded by [[Arts Council England]] to lead the development of the museums sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fitzwilliam Museum|url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/|website=www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=21 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and buildings==

[[File:Fitzwilliam Museum interior.jpg|thumb|left|View of one of the museum's entrance halls]]

The museum was founded in 1816 with the legacy of the library and art collection of [[Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam]]. The bequest also included £100,000 "to cause to be erected a good substantial museum repository". The collection was initially placed in the old [[Perse School]] building in [[Free School Lane]]. It was moved in 1842 to the [[Old Schools]] (at that time the [[Cambridge University Library|University Library]]). The "Founder's Building" itself was designed by [[George Basevi]], completed by [[Charles Robert Cockerell|C. R. Cockerell]] and opened in 1848; the entrance hall is by [[Edward Middleton Barry]] and was completed in 1875. The first stone of the new building was laid by [[Gilbert Ainslie]] in 1837. A further large bequest was made to the University in 1912 by [[Charles Brinsley Marlay]], including a sum of £80,000 and a collection of 84 pictures. A two-storey extension, paid for partly by the Courtauld family, was added in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66639 The University of Cambridge — The Fitzwilliam Museum], [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/ British History Online], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
[[File:Fitzwilliam Museum - Marble bust of Antinous.jpg|thumb|left|Marble bust of Antinous]]
The museum has five departments: Antiquities; Applied Arts; Coins and Medals; Manuscripts and Printed Books; and Paintings, Drawings and Prints. Together these cover antiquities from ancient [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Nubia]], [[ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], [[Egypt (Roman province)|Romano-Egyptian]] art, Western Asiatic displays, and a new gallery of Cypriot art; applied arts, including English and European pottery and glass, furniture, clocks, fans, armour, Chinese, Japanese and Korean art, rugs and samplers; coins and medals; illuminated, literary and music manuscripts and rare printed books; paintings, including masterpieces by [[Simone Martini]], [[Domenico Veneziano]], [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]], [[Jan van Goyen|van Goyen]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Canaletto]], [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], [[John Constable|Constable]], [[Monet]], [[Degas]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Cézanne]] and [[Picasso]] and a fine collection of 20th-century art; miniatures, drawings, watercolours and prints. Among the notable works in the antiquities collection is a [[bas-relief]] from [[Persepolis]].&lt;ref&gt;A Persepolis Relief in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge

===Music manuscripts===

There is also the largest collection of 16th-century [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Elizabethan]] [[virginal]] manuscript music written by some of the most notable composers of the time, such as [[William Byrd]], [[John Bull (composer)|Doctor John Bull]], [[Orlando Gibbons]] and [[Thomas Tallis]].

===Egyptian collection===

The Egyptian Galleries at the Fitzwilliam Museum reopened in 2006 after a two-year, £1.5 million programme of refurbishment, conservation and research.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Paintings===

The museum has a particularly extensive collection of [[J. M. W. Turner]], which has its origins in a set of 25 watercolour drawings donated to the university by [[John Ruskin]] in 1861.&lt;ref name="turner1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/friends/exhibits/turner_heidelberg.html|title=Fitzwilliam Museum collections|year=2010|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Sydney Cockerell]], who was serving as director of the museum at the time, went on to acquire a further eight Turner watercolours and some of his writings.

Many items in the museum are on loan from colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]], for example an important group of impressionist paintings owned by [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], which includes [[Cézanne]]'s ''The Abduction'' and a study for ''[[Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'' by [[Seurat]].

The museum's collection of [[Pre-Raphaelite]] paintings includes a version of [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'', voted eighth-greatest painting in Britain in 2005's [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] poll, the [[Greatest Painting in Britain Vote]].

===Michelangelo bronzes===

In 2015, the museum displayed two bronze statues (the [[Rothschild Bronzes]]) that it believed to be the work of Italian [[Renaissance]] artist [[Michaelangelo]]. If true, they would be the only known surviving bronze sculptures by the artist.  The pair of statues depict naked, apparently drunk, men riding [[panthera|panthers]].  Art historian [[Paul Joannides (art historian)|Paul Joannides]] connected the statues to a drawing in the [[Musée Fabre]] by an apprentice of Michelangelo depicting the same subject in the same pose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/news/archive/article.html?5006 |title=The Fitzwilliam Museum : Home |publisher=Fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905162521/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/news/archive/article.html?5006 |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Brown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/02/michelangelo-bronzes-sculptures-fitzwilliam-museum-cambridge |title=Michelangelo's bronze panther-riders revealed after 'Renaissance whodunnit' &amp;#124; Art and design |publisher=The Guardian |date=2015-01-30 |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2015/02/michelangelo |title=Michelangelo: The story of the bronze riders |publisher=The Economist |date=2015-02-02 |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-02-03/nude-drunk-and-riding-panthers-michelangelos-lost-masterpiece-discovered |title=Nude, drunk and riding on panthers: Michelangelo's lost masterpiece discovered &amp;#124; Public Radio International |publisher=Pri.org |date=2015-02-03 |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-31085336 |title=Bronze sculptures 'may be by Michelangelo' - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gordon Stewart Wood''' (born November 27, 1933) is Alva O. Way University Professor and Professor of History Emeritus at [[Brown University]], and the recipient of the 1993 [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] for ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992). His book ''The Creation of the American Republic, 1776–1787'' (1969) won a 1970 [[Bancroft Prize]].  In 2010 he was awarded the [[National Humanities Medal]].

==Biography==

===Youth and education===
Wood was born in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], and grew up in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]]. He graduated [[Latin honors|''summa cum laude'']] from [[Tufts University]] in 1955 and has served as a [[trustee]] there. After serving in the [[U.S. Air Force]] in [[Japan]], during which time he earned an [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] at [[Harvard University]], he entered the [[Ph.D.]] program in history at Harvard, where he studied under [[Bernard Bailyn]], receiving his Ph.D. in 1964.

===Career===
Wood has taught at [[Harvard]], the [[College of William and Mary]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[Brown University]], and in 1982–83 was [[Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions|Pitt Professor]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].

In addition to his books (listed below), Wood has written numerous influential articles, notably "Rhetoric and Reality in the [[American Revolution]]" (1966), "Conspiracy and the Paranoid Style: Causality and Deceit in the Eighteenth century" (1982), and "Interests and Disinterestedness in the Making of the [[Constitution]]" (1987). He is a frequent contributor to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]''.

A recent project was the third volume of the ''[[Oxford History of the United States]]'' -- ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789–1815'' (2009) -- a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]].

==Marriage and family==
Wood married the former Louise Goss on April 30, 1956. They have three children: Christopher, Elizabeth and Amy.&lt;ref name=Contemporary /&gt; Their son, [[Christopher Wood (art historian)|Christopher Wood]], is a professor of German at New York University and their daughter, Amy, is a professor of history at [[Illinois State University]], and Elizabeth is an administrator at Milton Academy.

==In popular culture==
[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]] publicly and effusively praised Wood's ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992), erroneously calling it ''The Founding of America''.  Wood, who met Gingrich once in 1994, surmised that Gingrich may have approved because the book "had a kind of Toquevillian touch to it, I guess, maybe suggesting American exceptionalism, that he liked".  He jokingly described Gingrich's praise in an interview on [[C-SPAN]] in 2002 as "the kiss of death for me among a lot of academics, who are not right-wing Republicans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=National Cable Satellite Corporation |title=Booknotes |date=April 21, 2002 |work=Transcript of an interview with Wood by [[Brian Lamb]] on C-SPAN's Booknotes |url=http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/168964-1/Gordon-Wood.aspx |accessdate=September 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the celebrated scenes of the 1997 movie  ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', [[Matt Damon]]'s title character gets into a battle of wits with a student from [[Harvard University]], whom he accuses of uncritically parroting the views of the authors on his reading list as a first-year graduate student.  He goes on to predict that a little later in his curriculum, he would simply be "regurgitating Gordon Wood."  The student begins to respond with a critique of Wood, which Hunting interrupts, completes, and notes is [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] from [[Daniel Vickers]]' ''[[Farmers and Fishermen: Two Centuries of Work in Essex County]]''.

In "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" at a college party Charlie,the janitor of Paddy's Pub owned by him and his friends "the gang", references Gordon Wood. Trying to duplicate the success of Matt Damon's character in "Good Will Hunting" had with no success since he has no idea who Gordon Wood is or what his work was. He embarrassingly just assumes since he is a janitor like Matt Damon's character was he'd be able to pull off the same argument Damon had. Even though he had no idea what he was talking about.

'''Guy Halsall''' (born 1964) is an English historian of Early Medieval Europe. He is currently based at the [[University of York]], and has published a number of books, essays, and articles on the subject of early medieval history and archeology. Halsall's current research focuses on western Europe in the important period of change around AD 600 and on the application of continental philosophy (especially the work of [[Jacques Derrida]]) to history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.york.ac.uk/history/staff/profiles/halsall/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Guy Halsall was born in [[North Ferriby]] in 1964 and raised in [[Worcestershire]]. He studied [[Archaeology]] and History at the [[University of York]], earning the first First-Class degree from York's archaeology department in 1986. He completed his D.Phil at York in 1991 with a thesis on the "history and archaeology of the region of [[Metz]] in the Merovingian period" supervised by [[Edward James (historian)|Edward James]] and examined by [[Steve Roskams]] and [[Bryan Ward-Perkins]].&lt;ref name="york.academia.edu"&gt;https://york.academia.edu/GuyHalsall&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1990 Halsall was awarded a post-doctoral research fellowship at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]]. From 1991-2002 he was a permanent lecturer, and then reader, in early medieval history and archaeology at [[Birkbeck, University of London]].  In 2003 he moved to the University of York, and was promoted to a professorship there in 2006.&lt;ref name="york.academia.edu"/&gt;

In June 2013, Halsall was one of the signatories to an open letter criticising the proposed changes to the British history curriculum being implemented by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Minister for Education [[Michael Gove]]. The letter expressed the opinion that the proposed reforms were "underpinned by an unbalanced promotion of partisan political views" in that they emphasised an Anglocentric "national triumphalism" and thus contravened the Education Acts of 1996 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/letters/letters-13th-june-2013-full-list-of-signatories-8656150.html |title=Letters 13th June, 2013: Full list of signatories |publisher=The Independent |date=12 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, Halsall briefly attracted attention in the Times Higher after a University of York student newspaper, Nouse, published an intemperate message he had sent to students enrolled on an undergraduate course, concerning non-attendance at lectures.&lt;ref name="Nouse"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nouse.co.uk/2012/12/04/lecturer-deeply-regrets-offence-caused-by-post/ |title=Lecturer "deeply regrets" offence caused by post |publisher=Nouse |author=Blumsom, Amy |accessdate=20 December 2014 |date=4 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/dont-you-kids-know-who-i-am/422246.article |title=Don't you kids know who I am? |publisher=Times Higher Education |author=Jump, Paul |accessdate=20 December 2014 |date=3 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tone of his post caused some offence at the time,  and the student newspaper published Halsall's apology. In view of the publicity the exchange had attracted, the History Department and Board of Studies at York made a joint statement highlighting that Halsall was "among the most highly rated" lecturers according to student evaluations, and suggesting that his original comments reflected the understandable frustration of "a world-leading scholar and excellent lecturer" faced with a noticeable degree of student non-attendance.&lt;ref name="Nouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE"/&gt;

In 2013, Halsall published a book arguing that the historical King Arthur either never existed or that if he did, virtually nothing can be known about him. Although this view is widely held within academia, it contrasts greatly with the large body of popular books by amateur historians which have multiple and conflicting reconstructions of the 'real' King Arthur.

'''HDMS ''Sælen'' (S323)''' (or '''KDM ''Sælen'' ''') is one of the three [[Kobben-class submarine|''Tumleren''-class]] small [[coastal submarine]]s of the [[Royal Danish Navy]].

==History==
She was built as a [[Type 207 submarine]] by [[Nordseewerke|Rheinstahl-Nordseewerke]] of [[Emden, Germany]] in 1965 for the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] and served for 25 years as HNoMS ''Uthaug'' before being purchased by [[Denmark]] in 1990, and renamed after the [[seal (mammal)|seal]]. Her international call sign is OUCJ.

On 4 December 1990, ''Sælen'' sank while being towed from [[Copenhagen]] to [[Aarhus]].  On 17 December, she was raised by the German floating crane ''Roland'' and taken to [[Aarhus]] for repair.  On 10 August 1993, diving approval was issued and the boat was recommissioned.

''Sælen'' served in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] from May 2002 until June 2003.  To speed her return to her homeport of [[Frederikshavn]] after 385 days of deployment in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]], she was transported on board the heavy-lift ship ''Grietje''.

==Museum ship==
[[File:Danish Submarine -a.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Sælen'' at Holmen, Copenhagen ]]
After her return from the [[Persian Gulf]], ''Sælen'' was decommissioned and handed over to the [[Royal Danish Naval Museum]]. ''Sælen'' is now on the hard at the old navy headquarters at [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Holmen]] in central [[Copenhagen]] where she is open to visitors.

==Current work==
;Implementation of [[natural language understanding]] systems using [[dynamic attractor sequences]]
Dr Moisl has been developing a strictly sequential natural language understanding architecture that dispenses with two foundational principles of generative linguistics, mainstream cognitive science, and much of artificial intelligence—that natural language strings have complex syntactic structure processed by structure-sensitive algorithms, and that this structure is crucial in determining string semantics. This sequential architecture was originally stated in terms of standard automata theory as a system of cooperating finite state automata, but more recently I have become interested in neuroscientific work which identifies chaotic attractor trajectory in state space as the fundamental principle of brain function at a level above that of the individual neuron, and which indicates that sensory processing, and perhaps higher cognition more generally, are implemented by cooperating attractor sequence processes. Some relevant publications are:

;Natural language corpus creation
Together with Karen Corrigan of Newcastle University and Joan Beal of Sheffield University, He has recently completed the Newcastle Electronic Corpus of Tyneside English (NECTE), a corpus of dialect speech from Tyneside in North-East England. It is based on two pre-existing corpora, one of them collected in the late 1960s by the Tyneside Linguistic Survey (TLS) project, and the other in 1994 by the Phonological Variation and Change in Contemporary Spoken English (PVC) project. NECTE amalgamates the TLS and PVC materials into a single Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)-conformant XML-encoded corpus and makes them available in a variety of aligned formats: digitized audio, standard orthographic transcription, phonetic transcription, and part-of-speech tagged. This website describes the NECTE corpus in detail, and makes it available to academic researchers, educationalists, the media in non-commercial applications, and organisations such as language societies and individuals with a serious interest in historical dialect materials.

;Exploratory multivariate analysis of text corpora
Since completion of the NECTE project he has been developing a methodology for sociolinguistic and dialectological study of the corpus, the aim of which is to attempt to identify interesting regularities in phonetic variation among [[Informant (linguistics)|informants]] in the corpus, and any correlations between such variation and associated social factors. The methodology is based on the one formulated by the originators of much of the NECTE corpus, the Tyneside Linguistic Survey (TLS). It was radical at the time and remains so today: in contrast to the then-universal and still-dominant theory driven approach, where social and linguistic factors are selected by the analyst on the basis of some combination of an independently specified theoretical framework, existing case studies, and personal experience of the domain of enquiry, the TLS proposed a fundamentally empirical approach in which salient factors are extracted from the data itself and then serve as the basis for model construction. To implement its approach the TLS used a particular exploratory multivariate analytical technique, hierarchical cluster analysis, but its work never progressed beyond preliminary studies for a variety of theoretical and practical reasons. His development of the TLS methodology 
*'''i.''' uses a range of linear and nonlinear exploratory analytical methods in addition to hierarchical cluster analysis, such as multidimensional scaling and self-organizing maps, and
*'''ii.''' pays particular attention to issues in data creation which are crucial to the validity of analytical results: document length normalization, dimensionality reduction, and data nonlinearity.

A narrative work beginning '''''in medias res''''' ({{IPA-la|ɪn mɛdiaːs reːs|classical}}&lt;!-- n assimilated to labial of next word --&gt;, lit. "into the middle of things"&lt;!--in+acc (preposition) "into", medias (adjective, acc plural, from medius) "middle", res (noun, acc plural, from res) "things"--&gt;) opens in the midst of the plot (cf. ''[[ab ovo]]'', ''[[ab initio]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/284369/in-medias-res |title= In medias res |publisher= ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |accessdate= July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]] is bypassed and filled in gradually, either through dialogue, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] or description of past events. For example, ''[[Hamlet]]'' begins after the death of Hamlet's father. Characters make reference to King Hamlet's death without the plot's first establishment of said fact. Since the play focuses on Hamlet and the revenge itself more so than the motivation, Shakespeare utilizes ''in medias res'' to bypass superfluous exposition.

Works that employ ''in medias res'' often, though not always, will subsequently use flashback and [[nonlinear narrative]] for exposition of earlier events in order to fill in the [[backstory]]. For example, in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', we first learn about Odysseus's journey when he is held captive on Calypso's island. We then find out, in Books IX through XII, that the greater part of Odysseus's journey precedes that moment in the narrative. On the other hand, Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' has relatively few flashbacks, although it opens in the thick of the [[Trojan War]].

== First use of the phrase ==
The Roman lyric poet and satirist [[Horace]] (65–8 BC) first used the terms '''''ab ōvō''''' ("from the egg") and '''''in mediās rēs''''' ("into the middle of things") in his ''[[Ars poetica]]'' ("Poetic Arts", c. 13 BC), wherein lines 147&amp;ndash;149 describe the ideal [[epic poetry|epic poet]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horace |authorlink=Horace  |title=Ars poetica   |url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/horace/arspoet.shtml  |language=Latin |quote=nec '''gemino''' bellum Troianum orditur '''ab ovo'''; / semper ad eventum festinat et '''in medias res''' / [...] auditorem rapit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Nor does he begin the [[Trojan War]] ''from the egg'',
but always he hurries to the action, and snatches the listener ''into the middle of things''. . . .|}}

The "egg" reference is to the [[mythology|mythological]] origin of the [[Trojan War]] in the birth of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and [[Clytemnestra]] from the double egg laid by [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] following her seduction by [[Zeus]] in the guise of a [[swan]].

== Literary history ==

Probably originated in [[oral tradition]], the narrative technique of beginning a story ''in medias res'' is a stylistic convention of [[epic poetry]], the exemplars in Western literature being the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' (both 7th century BC), by [[Homer]].&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, Christopher John (2004). ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850''. [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]. p. 319. {{ISBN|1-57958-422-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the technique features in the Indian ''[[Mahābhārata]]'' (c. 8th century BC – c. 4th century AD). 

The [[Classics|classical-era]] poet [[Virgil]] (Publius Vergilius Maro, 70–19 BC) continued this literary narrative technique in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which is part of the Greek literary tradition of imitating [[Homer]].&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt; Later works featuring ''in medias res'' include the stories "[[Sinbad the Sailor]]" and "[[The Three Apples]]" from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (c. 9th century),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–94|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' (12th century), the Spanish ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'' (c. 14th century), the Italian ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (1320) by [[Dante Alighieri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Danteworlds: A Reader's Guide to the Divine Comedy|last=P. Raffa|first=Guy|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=978-0226702704|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Portuguese ''[[The Lusiads]]'' (1572) by [[Luís Vaz de Camões]], ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' (1581) by [[Torquato Tasso]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667) by  [[John Milton]], and generally in [[Modernist literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Carol (1984). ''Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy: The Inferno''. Barron's Educational Series. p. 24. {{ISBN|0-7641-9107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern novelists known to extensively employ ''in medias res'' in conjunction with flashbacks include [[William Faulkner]] and [[Toni Morrison]].

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]’s [[The Tell-Tale Heart]] is written in medias res.

== Cinematic history ==
It is typical for [[film noir]] to begin ''in medias res''; for example, a private detective will enter the plot already in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Philosophy of Film Noir|first = Deborah|last=Knight|editor1-first = Mark T. |editor1-last = Conard |editor2-first = Robert |editor2-last = Porfirio |publisher = University Press of Kentucky |year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-8131-9181-2 |page = 208}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' (1947) opens with the murder of Joseph Samuels. As the police investigate the crime, the story behind the murder is told via flashbacks.&lt;ref name="MayerMcDonnell2007"&gt;

Inside, the backstory is told in flashback as Murdock explains his situation to a priest.&lt;ref name="MayerMcDonnell2007" /&gt;

The technique has been used across genres, including dramas such as ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]'' (1961),&lt;ref name="Miller1980"&gt;{{cite book |title = Screenwriting for Narrative Film and Television |first = William Charles |last = Miller |publisher = Hastingshouse/Daytrips |year = 1980 |isbn = 978-0-8038-6773-4 |page = 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[8½]]'' (1963),&lt;ref name="Miller1980" /&gt; ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), and ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' (2002);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovateus.net/innopedia/what-term-medias-res What is the term, In Medias Res?]&lt;/ref&gt; crime thrillers such as ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]'' (1987), ''[[Grievous Bodily Harm]]'' (1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = New Australian Cinema |first1 = Brian |last1 = McFarlane |first2 = Geoff |last2 = Mayer |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1992 |isbn = 978-0-521-38768-2 |page = 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995),&lt;ref name="MurfinRay2009" /&gt; and ''[[Kill Bill|Kill Bill Volume 2]]'' (2004);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Remade in Hollywood |first = Kenneth |last = Chan |publisher = Hong Kong University Press |year = 2009 |isbn = 978-962-209-056-9 |page = 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; horror films such as ''[[Firestarter (film)|Firestarter]]'' (1984);&lt;ref name="Muir2007"&gt;{{cite book |title = Horror Films of the 1980s |first = John Kenneth |last = Muir |publisher = McFarland |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-7864-2821-2 |pages = 135, 389}}&lt;/ref&gt; action films such as many in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] franchise;&lt;ref name="MurfinRay2009"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Bedford Glossary of Critical and Literary Terms|first1 = Ross C. |last1 = Murfin |first2 = Supryia M. |last2 = Ray |publisher = Bedford/St. Martins |year = 2009 |isbn = 978-0-230-22330-1|page = 245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donnelly2001"&gt;{{cite book |title = Film Music|first = Kevin J.|last = Donnelly |publisher = Edinburgh University Press|year = 2001 |isbn = 978-0-7486-1288-8 |page = 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comedies such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964).&lt;ref name="Miller1980"/&gt;

Many [[war films]], such as ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'' (1998), also begin ''in medias res'', with the protagonists already actively in combat and no prior domestic scenes leading up to the film's events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = wHeroes of Film, Comics and American Culture |chapter = Ridley Scott's Epics: Gender of Violence |first = Danielle |last = Glassmeyer |editor-first = Lisa M. |editor-last = Detora |publisher = McFarland |year = 2009 |isbn = 978-0-7864-3827-3 |pages = 297–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, adaptations of source material may employ ''in medias res'' while the original version did not. For example, the [[Camelot (film)|film adaptation]] of the stage musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' employed ''in medias res'' while the original Broadway version did not (although revivals of the musical have).{{cn|date=July 2017}} Stanley Kubrick's 1962 [[Lolita (1962 film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[Lolita]]'' begins ''in medias res'' although the novel does not.{{cn|date=July 2017}} [[Herman Wouk]]'s stage adaptation of his own novel ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'' begins ''in medias res'' as it opens with the court-martial that occupies the final section of the novel, telling the earlier part of the story through flashbacks in court-room testimony.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

'''''In the Shadow of Your Wings''''' (Unter dem Schatten deiner Flügel) is a collection of selected entries from the diary of [[Jochen Klepper]] covering the period between April 1932 and 10 December 1942. The book appeared in 1956.

The [[Protestantism|Protestant]] German [[Author|writer]], [[journalist]] and [[poet]] of ecclesiastical songs, Jochen Klepper, loses his creative power in the course of the above-mentioned ten years under steadily increasing [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist]] reprisals. Klepper is married with the [[Jew]] Johanna. Hanni, as Johanna is called, has brought two daughters from her first marriage. Klepper's younger stepdaughter Renate is threatened with [[deportation]] after the [[World War II|war]] begins.  Klepper applies for an exit permit for the young girl to go to Sweden. The author appeals to the [[Sicherheitsdienst|security services]]. There his request is turned down. Klepper takes his own life together along the lives of his wife and child in a nondescript Berlin residential house.

== Diary ==
'''1932''' Klepper suffers from his childlessness. He calls himself a "[[Religion|religious]] [[Socialism|socialist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the 30-year-old author is narrow. But Klepper is fulfilled as an [[intellectual]] by big desire for fame.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1933''' To Kleppers understanding is not author who has merely ideas and materials. Author is who can express that quite peculiar "state of the liveliness"&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; in his text. Talent would be unnecessary.&lt;br/&gt;
The Nazis have now all power monopolized. Klepper is at the [[Radio]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; employed. He is denounced: "Jewish family. [[SPD]] member"&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; is the accusation. The active employees will be suspended from service. Still Klepper not despondent. Because he holds fast to his faith, writes in his novel "The Father, Novel of [[Frederick William I of Prussia|the Soldier-King]]" ([[Stuttgart]] 1937) and loves his wife Hanni. Is Klepper "divine tool"?&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; He has doubts.
Also  these odious "[[memoir]]s", which Klepper writes down - which value do they have? The writer will remain in the country at any rate. Abroad he sees no working possibility. Indeed, in Berlin the giants [[Ullstein-Verlag|Ullstein]] and [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]] want his cooperation, however, do not pay. Thus Klepper would like to be taken up in the [[:de:Reichsschrifttumskammer|Empire Literature Chamber]].&lt;br/&gt;
'''1934''' The plan succeeds, because one of his guarantors is a [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] man. Besides, Klepper calls the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] "ill visionaries",&lt;ref name="Source p. 145"&gt;Source p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; if he entrusts with his worry about the future of Germany the diary.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1935''' Clamour is not possible for Klepper. He lives under the motto "Keep still".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; With such behavior a small private sphere can be saved. The excesses in [[Kurfürstendamm]] are disconcerting. Jewish women receive on the open road slaps in the face.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of all that, Klepper further wants to write, as long as he may still remain in the Empire Literature Chamber. Since writing is a religious process for him. God has called the author and latter answers with a book - a stammered answer.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''1936''' German relatives recommend to the couple Klepper repeatedly to send both daughters in the sure foreign country. Klepper said the precaution would be unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The author probably knows about his isolation in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 223&lt;/ref&gt; however, he builds on the help of God.&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In '''1937''', on 25 March&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; the author from the Empire Literature Chamber is excluded. The reason is to Kleppers conviction his [[:de:Mischehe (Nationalsozialismus)|mixing marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusion is out on an appeal in June suspended, and the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Imperial War Department]] recommends Kleppers new novel "The Father" as a reading for the [[Wehrmacht]] members.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1938''' However, the Empire Literature Chamber accuses the [[Christian]] Klepper "of slavish posture" which would contradict the "new mind".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; From March Klepper is supervised no more by the Empire Literature Chamber, but by the [[Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]]. Nevertheless, in this precarious situation there is still a courageous journalist, the Klepper his organ as a platform offers: The Protestant theologian [[:de:Hermann Mulert|Prof. Mulert]] encourages the author to write for the "Christian world". Klepper remains careful. If [[Ernst Wiechert]] sits, nevertheless, because of the case [[Martin Niemöller|Niemöller]] in the [[Buchenwald concentration camp|concentration camp]]. Klepper and his wife, Hanni register well as Jewish doctors and lawyers in Germany are no longer allowed to practice, how German Jews to sell their assets and emigrate. There should be a [[Buchenwald concentration camp|concentration camp]] near [[Weimar]]. Every German Jew should carry from [[:de:Namensänderungsverordnung|1st January, 1939]], in addition, the given name [[List of Biblical names#I|Israel]] or [[Sara (given name)|Sara]] and must give him everywhere. Polish Jews in Germany will be imprisoned or expelled. In spite of this news couple Klepper builds a new house in Berlin. In connection with the [[Kristallnacht]] Klepper disturb the arbitrary arrests of Jewish men by the [[Gestapo]]. Klepper's wife Hanni [[Religious conversion|converts]] to the Christianity. Klepper is horrified about Hannis [[:de:Kennkarte|identification card]].&lt;br/&gt;
'''1939''' Both stepdaughters Kleppers would like to [[Emigration|emigrate]]. Wife Hanni wants to remain. [[Nazism|NS]] [[Ideology|ideologist]] [[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] speaks openly, all Jews should leave the [[German Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; German Jews must offer before certain valuables - as for example precious metals - to buying places to the sales.&lt;br/&gt;
When the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|war breaks out]], Klepper does a [[Patriotism|patriotic]] note in his diary: He could not Germany the decline wish.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 468&lt;/ref&gt; As from November Jews for leaving their local authorized by the Gestapo need, Klepper expresses the suicide thought. Is [[suicide]] a sin? The older stepdaughter is the departure to England succeed. Because of the younger daughter Renate wants the couple to stay alive.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1940''' February: A rumour reaches Klepper. Jews would be deported by [[Szczecin]] to [[Lublin]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; As a wife of an "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" Hanni is protected. However, for daughter Renate it becomes more and more dangerous: Men of the [[SS-Totenkopfverbände|Death's Head SS]] ring in the front door and inquire after the young girl. Renate converts - like before her mother - to the Christianity. Klepper receives news from an unfathomable process in the German Reich: [[Racial hygiene|Hindered]] are murdered. All called events weaken taken together the creativity of the sensitive Klepper so much that he manages the next novels ([[Katharina Luther|Katharina von Bora]]) no more. The vitality, however, he wants to keep. And thus he struggles dogged, tenaciously and, in the end, successfully for an entry permit for Renate to Sweden. For all that Klepper means on 26 July surprisingly, Germany will defeat England.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 522, 4th Line up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''1941''' From December, 1940 Klepper serves with the armed forces and will dismiss at the beginning of October, 1941 because of "military unworthiness", thus because of his "non-aryan marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin's Jews are now in a very hard situation. Renate must carry discriminating [[Yellow badge]] and brings terrifying news with home: Confessed become after [[Łódź|Litzmannstadt]] deports. The suicide thought lies to young Renate far. She hopes for survival. Klepper penetrates up to "[[Minister without Portfolio#Germany|Imperial Minister]] Dr. [[Wilhelm Frick|Frick]]" and obtains a document in which Renate ministerial protection from deportation is assured. This letter may Renates life admittedly only so long protected until the Sicherheitsdienst mercilessly intervenes. News about the deportation of Jews takes no end. Renate sways between depression and hope.
The girl tells the thoughts of suicide, if their departure fail should, not go back. News of massacres, perpetrated on Jews, invade from the east to Berlin.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1942''' Hanni rejects the thought of triple suicide. Klepper does not know whether he should condemn the German warfare. After tantalizing back-and-forth Renate from Sweden receives the desired entry permit. Frick is no more responsible, in the meantime, for the exit permit, but now [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann]]. Klepper does not receive the permission and goes voluntarily to the death.

== Title ==
Kleppers faith in God seems steadfast. An external sign of this deep religiousness are the omnipresent [[Bible#Old Testament|Bible]] citations. Under one of the verses stands the book:
:Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me,
:for my soul takes refuge in you.
:Yes, '''in the shadow of your wings''', I will take refuge,
:until disaster has passed. [[s:Bible (World English)/Psalms#Psalm 57|Psalm 57,1]]&lt;ref&gt;Source pp. 3, 208, 364, 530&lt;/ref&gt;
All citations reflect taken together upon the ten-year-period away the unprecedented God's trust and last imploring, yes, last of all shouting God in the highest need.

== Persons ==

Klepper reports about narrower contacts with writers: [[:de:Reinhold Schneider|Reinhold Schneider]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:de:Rudolf Alexander Schröder|Rudolf Alexander Schröder]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; are called multiple. Klepper mentions several prominent concentration camp prisoners - activists of the [[Confessing Church|Bekennenden Kirche]] - thus, e.g., the [[pastor]] [[:de:Hans Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg-Bochum]].

== Style and themes ==

The extensive memoirs can be read as a dialog with God. Klepper lays his welfare and woe in the hands of the Lord. However, besides, Klepper knows that he "one day", as [[Werner Bergengruen|Bergengruen]]&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 262, 14th Bottom line&lt;/ref&gt; formulates a little disrespectfully, before "his heavenly commander" will have to be responsible for his acting and letting. The form arises from the said. Klepper, deeply religious, has torn to and fro. He knows, he does mistakes, but he cannot from his skin. Among the wings of the Lord standing, the fate of the author's resume. And Klepper meticulously describes the process. The honesty and independence of the author is impressive with all. Before the surprised reader enters less the fighter Klepper than rather the silent sufferer.

== Reception ==
*Bergengruen&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 259 - 268&lt;/ref&gt; does in January, 1957 in his detailed review to the first publication of the diaries no secret from his quite obviously deeply to seated resentments.
**It looks as subordinate Bergengruen of sister Hildegard  of the author material motives in the publication of the diaries of brother.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bergengruen speaks a truth. Renate's life was as of a "[[Nuremberg Laws|full Jew]]" - as one said in the [[:de:Sprache des Nationalsozialismus|NS linguistic usage]] - threatens in the German Reich. Klepper has had long enough time to support the emigration of the girl.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Bergengruen can conclude in the connection from the memoirs neither on feelings of guilt nor on selfdoubt of the author.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 266 bottom - 267 top&lt;/ref&gt;
**To an opponent of the Nazi regime the subservien Klepper could not explain itself.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;
**Indeed, Bergengruen certifies mental power to the author, however, it lacks him of feeling and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bergengruen also calls details which are not discoverable in the available book: For example, when he Klepper after October 1941, in his Berlin home visits, the blended man of the house has glorified his period of service with the armed forces and has regretted his forcible elimination from the troop.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 264, 267&lt;/ref&gt;
*Klepper should have taken away his diaries from the access of the NS henchmen successfully, while he buried the papers.&lt;ref&gt;Riegel, van Rinsum p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

{{No footnotes|date=July 2017}}
'''Italic script''', also known as '''chancery cursive''', is a semi-[[cursive]], slightly sloped style of [[handwriting]] and [[calligraphy]] that was developed during the [[Renaissance]] in [[Italy]]. It is one of the most popular styles used in contemporary Western calligraphy, and is often one of the first scripts learned by beginning calligraphers.

==History==
[[Image:Humanist and Italic a.png|thumb|262px|One of the innovations of Niccoli's Italic script was the major change to the Humanist minuscule ''a''.]]
Italic script is based largely on [[Humanist minuscule]], which itself draws on [[Carolingian minuscule]]. The capital letters are the same as the Humanist capitals, modeled on [[Roman square capitals]]. The Italian scholar [[Niccolò de' Niccoli]] was dissatisfied with the lowercase forms of Humanist minuscule, finding it too slow to write. In response, he created the Italic script, which incorporates features and techniques characteristic of a quickly written hand: oblique forms, fewer strokes per character, and the joining of letters. Perhaps the most significant change to any single character was to the form of the ''a'', which he simplified from the two-story form to the one-story form ⟨ɑ⟩ now common to most handwriting styles.

Under the influence of Italic movable type used with [[printing press]]es, the style of handwritten Italic script moved towards disjoined, more mannered characters. By the 1550s the Italic script had become so laborious that it fell out of use with scribes.

The style became increasingly influenced by the development of [[Copperplate script|Copperplate]] writing styles in the eighteenth century. The style Italic script used today is often heavily influenced by developments made as late as the early 20th century. In the past few decades, the italic script has been promoted in English-speaking countries as an easier-to-learn alternative to traditional styles of cursive handwriting.

In the UK this revival was due in part to the 19th century artist [[William Morris]], in the 20th century it was [[Edward Johnston]]'s book ''Writing &amp; Illumination &amp; Lettering'' (1906) and [[Alfred Fairbank]]'s book ''A Handwriting Manual'' (1932) and the ''Driad Writing Cards'' (1935). These Driad cards were used for teaching young school children to write an italic hand.

A modern version called [[Getty-Dubay]] was introduced in 1976.

'''Lady of Cerro de los Santos''' (Dama del Cerro de los Santos), also known as '''Gran Dama Oferente''', is an [[Iberians|Iberian]] sculpture from the 2nd century BCE, that is now in [[National Archaeological Museum (Madrid)|National Archaeological Museum]] in [[Madrid]].

This limestone sculpture depicts a full-length standing female figure 1.3 metres high. It was found in 1870 in the [[Cerro de Los Santos|sanctuary of Cerro de los Santos]] in [[Montealegre del Castillo]] in [[Albacete]] province, [[Spain]].

The statue is sometimes called the Gran Dama Oferente because she is holding a container in her two hands and appears to be offering it. She is richly clad in three overlapping robes clasped with a [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]], or brooch, at the neck. Braided hair falls past her three necklaces. She is wearing fitted shoes. A ''rodete'' or wheel headgear appears on one side of her hair; if there was a similar one on the other side, it has been broken off. Like another contemporary [[Phoenicia]]n-influenced Iberian female sculpture, the [[Lady of Baza]], her drapery falls in a zigzag pattern.

'''Legal realism'''  is a [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] approach to [[law]] and is the view that [[jurisprudence]] should emulate the methods of [[natural science]], i.e., rely on [[empirical evidence]]. [[Hypotheses]] have to be tested against observations of the world. 

Legal realists believe that the legal science should investigate law exclusively with the value-free methods of natural sciences, also called 'sciences of the real' in some [[Continental Europe|Continental]] languages (e.g., 'Realwissenschaften', in [[German language|German]]). Some legal realists (e.g., [[Leon Petrażycki]] and [[Max Weber]]) also hold that there should exist, too, a legal dogmatics, which is independent of legal science proper but, this notwithstanding, can be regarded as a science in its own right (and so, despite its being a non-real, or formal, science). However, the focus of all legal realists is on legal science proper.

==Overview==
Due to their value-free approach, legal realists are opposed to [[natural law]] traditions. Legal realists regard these traditions as historical and/or social phenomena to be explained by making use of a variety of psychological and sociological hypotheses. They are also opposed to any form of [[linguistic turn]] in jurisprudence. When applied to law, they regard the linguistic turn as a sort of 'emasculation' (Enrico Pattaro) of legal phenomena. This is so because legal realists conceive legal phenomena as psychical phenomena, and, notably, as a form of ''moral motivation'' of human behavior (to be investigated with the methods of psychology and/or neurosciences). All this implies that legal realists are opposed to most versions of contemporary [[legal positivism]].

A further difference from all sorts of legal positivism is that legal realists refuse to confine their investigations to state law and/or positive law. Moreover, legal realists have a conception of law that stretches far beyond legal pluralism—so popular in many versions of classical and contemporary [[sociology of law]]. This is one of the reasons why legal realism cannot be regarded as a sort of sociology of law (other reasons being: legal realists' psychologism and their refusal of the linguistic turn—a turn that affected, too, sociology of law). Apart from Max Weber (who, owing to a variety of reasons, is mostly conceptualized as sociologist rather than as a legal realist), there are two strands of legal realism in this sense: Scandinavian legal realism, founded by [[Axel Hägerström]] (1868&amp;ndash;1939), and Polish-Russian legal realism, founded by [[Leon Petrażycki]] (1867&amp;ndash;1931). Both realisms, owing to their similarities (and despite their founders' ignoring one another), are sometimes referred to as 'continental legal realism' (in the singular).

In English-speaking countries the phrase 'legal realism' has often a somewhat different and more restricted meaning. It is used to refer to a conception of adjudication rather than of law in general. However, some legal realists in this other sense, including the founder of this movement, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], reduced law to the activity of courts and other state officials, thus proposing a kind of naturalistic and value-free reduction of law (a conception, though, that all Continental legal realists would reject, ''[[inter alia]]'', as excessively narrow). It is to this other kind of legal realism—also called 'American legal realism'—that this entry is devoted.

American legal realists (henceforth: realists) believe that there is more to adjudication than the mechanical application of known legal principles to uncontroversial fact-finding as [[legal formalism]] believes. Some realists believe that one can never be sure that the facts and [[law]] identified in the judge's reasons were the actual reasons for the judgment, whereas other realists accept that a judge's reasons can often be relied upon, but not all of the time. Realists believe that the legal principles that [[legal formalism]] treat as uncontroversial actually hide contentious political and moral choices.

Realism was treated as a conceptual claim for much of the late 20th century due to [[H. L. A. Hart]]'s misunderstanding of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, H. L. A. (1961). The Concept of Law (2nd ed. / with a postscript edited by Penelope A. Bulloch and Joseph Raz.). Oxford: Clarendon Press. Ch.VII&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was an analytical legal philosopher who was interested in conceptual analysis of concepts such as the concept of 'law'. This entailed identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept 'law'. When realists such as Oliver Wendell Holmes pointed out that individuals embroiled in the legal system generally wanted to know what was going to happen, Hart assumed that they were offering the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept 'law'. Nowadays, legal theorists tend to recognise that the realists and the conceptual lawyers were interested in different questions. Realists are interested in methods of predicting judges with more accuracy, whereas conceptual lawyers are interested in the correct use of legal concepts.

Legal realism was primarily a reaction to the [[legal formalism]] of the late 19th century and early 20th century, and was the dominant approach for much of the early 20th century. It succeeded in its negative aspiration of casting doubt upon formalist assumptions that judges always did what they said so that it is often said that 'we are all realists now.' However, realism failed in its positive aspiration of discovering a better way of predicting how judges would behave than relying on the reasons given by judges.

A theory of law and legal reasoning that arose in the early decades of the twentieth century broadly characterized by the claim that law can be best understood by focusing on what judges actually ''do'' in deciding cases, rather than on what they say they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Shiner, "Legal Realism," in Robert Audi, ed., ''The Cambridge Dictionary of'' ''Philosophy''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; The central target of legal realism was legal formalism: the classical view that judges don't make law, but mechanically apply it by logically deducing uniquely correct legal conclusions from a set of clear, consistent, and comprehensive legal rules.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, "American Legal Realism," in Martin P. Golding and William A. Edmundson, eds., ''The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Law and Legal Theory''. Oxford: Blackwell, 2005, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; American legal realism has aptly been described as "the most important indigenous jurisprudential movement in the United States during the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 50. There was also a Scandinavian school of legal realism that arose about the same time as its American cousin. This entry focuses on American legal realism.&lt;/ref&gt; Though most legal scholars today would agree that some aspects of legal realism were misguided or over-stated, its enduring influence on legal thought and legal education has been profound.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Forerunners==
Although the American legal realist movement first emerged as a cohesive intellectual force in the 1920s, it drew heavily upon a number of prior thinkers and was influenced by broader cultural forces. In the early years of the twentieth century, formalist approaches to the law had been forcefully criticized by thinkers such as [[Roscoe Pound]], [[John Chipman Gray]], and [[Benjamin Cardozo]]. Philosophers such as [[John Dewey]] had held up empirical science as a model of all intelligent inquiry, and argued that law should be seen as a practical instrument for advancing human welfare. Outside the realm of law, in fields such as economics and history, there was a general "revolt against formalism," a reaction in favor of more empirical ways of doing philosophy and the human sciences.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Neil Duxbury, ''Patterns of American Jurisprudence''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; But by far the most important intellectual influence on the legal realists was the thought of the American jurist and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.

===[[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]]===
Holmes is a towering figure in American legal thought for many reasons, but what the realists drew most from Holmes was his famous [[prediction theory of law]], his utilitarian approach to legal reasoning, and his "realist" insistence that judges, in deciding cases, are not simply deducing legal conclusions with inexorable, machine-like logic, but are influenced by ideas of fairness, public policy, and other personal and conventional values.

All these themes can be found in Holmes's famous 1897 essay, "The Path of the Law." There Holmes attacks formalist approaches to judicial decision making and states a pragmatic definition of "law": "The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr."&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., "The Path of the Law," 10 ''Harvard Law Review'' 457 (1897).&lt;/ref&gt; If law is prophecy, Holmes continues, we must reject the view of "text writers" who tell you that law "is something different from what is decided by the courts of Massachusetts or England, that it is a system of reason that is a deduction from principles of ethics or admitted axioms or what not, which may or may not coincide with the decisions".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr." /&gt;

Holmes next introduces his most important and influential argument, the "bad-man" theory of law: "[I]f we take the view of our friend the bad man we shall find that he does not care two straws" about either the morality or the logic of the law. For the bad man, "legal duty" signifies only "a prophecy that if he does certain things he will be subjected to disagreeable consequences by way of imprisonment or compulsory payment".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr." /&gt; The bad man cares nothing for legal theorizing and concerns himself only with practical consequences. In the spirit of [[pragmatism]], Holmes suggests that this is useful way of laying bare the true meaning of legal concepts.

The utilitarian or instrumentalist flavor of "The Path of the Law" also found favor with the realists. The purpose of the law, Holmes insisted, was the deterrence of undesirable social consequences: "I think that the judges themselves have failed adequately to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage."&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;William W. Fisher III, Morton J. Horwitz, Thomas A. Reed, eds., ''American Legal Realism''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Civil War, this conception of adjudication as a form of social engineering had been widely shared by American judges, but in the late nineteenth century it had fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Morton J. Horwitz, ''The Transformation of American'' ''Law, 1870–1960: The Crisis of Legal Orthodoxy''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aspirations of both Holmes and the realists was to revive it.

==Key themes==
Drawing upon Holmes and other critics of legal formalism, a number of iconoclastic legal scholars launched the legal realist movement in the 1920s and 30s. Among the leading legal realists were [[Karl Llewellyn]], [[Jerome Frank]], [[Herman Oliphant]], [[Underhill Moore]], Walter Wheeler Cook, [[Leon Green]], and [[Felix Cohen]]. Two American law schools, Yale and Columbia, were hotbeds of realist thought. Realism was a mood more than it was a cohesive movement, but it is possible to identify a number of common themes. These include:

* ''A distrust of the judicial technique of seeming to deduce legal conclusions from so-called rules of law''. The realists believed that judges neither do nor should decide cases formalistically.  Law is not, as the formalists claimed, a system of rules that is clear, consistent, and complete. Rather, the law is riddled with ambiguities, contradictions, gaps, vague terms, and conflicting rules of interpretation. As a result, there is often (perhaps always) no uniquely correct answer to any hard case that appellate judges decide. Law is incurably "indeterminate."
* ''A belief in the instrumental nature of the law''. Like Dewey and Pound, the realists believed that law does and should serve social ends. Judges unavoidably take account of considerations of fairness and public policy, and they are right to do so.&lt;ref&gt;According to legal scholar Brian Leiter, the "core claim" of legal realism is that judges do not decide cases on purely legal grounds; other factors play a significant and in fact predominant role. Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A desire to separate legal from moral elements in the law''. The realists were legal positivists who believed that law should be treated scientifically. A clear distinction should be drawn between what the law is and what it should be. Law can only be viewed as an empirical science, as it ought to be, if moralistic notions are either excluded or are translated into empirically verifiable terms.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Christie, ''Jurisprudence: Text and Readings on the Philosophy of Law''. St. Paul, MN: West Publishing Co., 1973, pp. 642–644.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that legal talk of "duty," "right," etc. is really just talk about how judges are likely to decide cases, is a clear example of how many realists tried to purge law of moralistic language and translate everything into "realistic" talk of actual consequences and testable predictions.

==Criticisms==

Legal realism had its heyday from the 1920s to the 1940s. In the 1950s, legal realism was largely supplanted by the legal process movement, which viewed law as a process of "reasoned elaboration" and claimed that appeals to "legislative purpose" and other well-established legal norms could provide objectively correct answers to most legal questions. In his 1961 book ''The'' ''Concept of Law'', British legal theorist H. L. A. Hart dealt what many scholars saw as a "decisive blow"&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 61. Leiter argues that Hart's criticism was off the mark, and that it was ''wrongly'' assumed to have refuted legal realism.&lt;/ref&gt; to legal realism, by attacking the predictive theory of law that many realists had taken over from Holmes. Hart pointed out that if a law is just a prediction of what courts will do, a judge pondering the legal merits of a case before him is really asking, "How will I decide this case?" As Hart notes, this completely misses the fact that judges use legal rules to ''guide'' their decisions, not as data to predict their eventual holdings.

Many critics have claimed that the realists exaggerated the extent to which law is "riddled" with gaps, contradictions, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Frederick Schauer, "Easy Cases," ''Southern California Law Review'', Vol. 38 (1985), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that most legal questions have simple, clear-cut answers that no lawyer or judge would dispute is difficult to square with the realists' strong claims of pervasive legal "indeterminacy." Other critics, such as [[Ronald Dworkin]] and [[Lon Fuller]], have faulted legal realists for their attempt sharply to separate law and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin, ''Taking Rights'' ''Seriously''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1978, pp. 22-28; Lon L. Fuller, ''The Morality of Law'', rev. ed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, pp. 33-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and continuing relevance==
Though many aspects of legal realism are now seen as exaggerated or outdated, most legal theorists would agree that the realists were successful in their central ambition: to refute "formalist" or "mechanical" notions of law and legal reasoning. It is widely accepted today that law is not, and cannot be, an exact science, and that it is important to examine what judges are actually doing in deciding cases, not merely what they say they are doing. As ongoing debates about [[judicial activism]] and judicial restraint attest, legal scholars continue to disagree about when, if ever, it is legitimate for judges to "make law," as opposed to merely "following" or "applying" existing law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lief H. Carter and Thomas F. Burke, ''Reason in Law'', 8th ed. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2015 (contending that law is frequently indeterminate and that judges often do, and should, make law by employing a variety of legal methods and sources, especially "purposive" interpretation); and Antonin Scalia and Bryan A. Garner, ''Reading'' ''Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts''. Minneapolis: West, 2012 (arguing that law is not highly indeterminate and that there is little legitimate leeway for judicial policymaking).&lt;/ref&gt; But few would disagree with the realists' core claim that judges (for good or ill) are often strongly influenced by their political beliefs, their personal values, their individual personalities, and other extra-legal factors.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 60 (noting that "[t]he paradigm of scholarship established by the Realists--contrasting what courts say they're doing with what they ''actually'' do--is one that has become so much the norm that distinguished scholars practice it without even feeling the need, any longer, to self-identify as Realists").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal realism and the European Court of Human Rights==
A statistical natural language processing method has been applied to automatically predict the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights (violation or no violation of a specific article) based on their textual contents, reaching a prediction accuracy of 79%.&lt;ref name="ecthr2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.

The authors write: "In general, and notwithstanding the simplified snapshot of a very complex debate that we just presented, our results could be understood as lending some support to the basic legal realist intuition according to which judges are primarily responsive to non-legal, rather than to legal, reasons when they decide hard cases."

He owned a large area of land between the Great Orme's Head near [[Llandudno]] and the [[Menai Strait]] off the north coast of Gwynedd.

This area was inundated by the sea,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} which has given rise to the legend of the drowned kingdom.

Llys Helig is mentioned in a number of old documents, some of which were published after expeditions to find the Palace.   These include -
:''An Ancient Survey of Pen Maen Mawr'', 1625 - 1649, by John Gwynn
:''The Map of Wales'', 1788, by W.Owen
:''Tours of Wales'', 1804, by Fenton
:''Cambria Depicta'', 1812, by Pugh
:''Baner ac Amserau Cymru'', 1864, Richard Parry &amp; Charlton Halls, a Paper to the Liverpool Geological Society
This last expedition reported finds of the remains of seaweed-covered walls, these walls indicating buildings some 100 yards long, and they concluded that this was indeed the palace.

==Llys Helig and the tale of Cantre'r Gwaelod==

[[Rachel Bromwich]] discusses what she refers to as the folk-tale of [[Cantre'r Gwaelod]], another alleged sunken kingdom but in [[Cardiganshire]]. As with Llys Helig, there are tales of remains being seen of the sunken kingdom.  Bromwich believes that the two stories influenced each other, and that "The widespread parallels to this inundation theme would suggest that the two stories are in fact one in origin, and were localized separately in Cardiganshire and in the Conway estuary, around two traditional figures of the sixth century. She also notes that the Halliwell Manuscript gives Helig the title "Lord of Cantre'r Gwaelod".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Early Cultures of North-West Europe|year=1950|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=231|author=Rachel Bromwich|editor=Cyril Fox, Bruce Dickins|chapter=Cantre'r Gwaelod and Ker-Is}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''New Directions In Celtic Studies'' Antone Minard wrote that "The Welsh legends of Cantre'r Gwaelod and Llys Helig (Helig's Court) contain the same details of audible bells beneath the waves and ruins which are visible at the equinoctial tides, which are the anchors of credulity in the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Directions In Celtic Studies|year=2000|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=9780859896221|page=60|author=Antone Minard|editor=Amy Hale and Philip Payton|chapter=Pre-Packaged Breton Folk Narrative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mount Royal [[Christian cross|Cross]]''' is a monument on top of [[Mount Royal]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. It stands at the northeastern peak of the mountain and overlooks the eastern part of the island.

==History==
[[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]], the city's founder, erected the first cross on Mount Royal in 1643, thereby fulfilling his vow to the [[Virgin Mary]] in his prayers to end a disastrous flood.&lt;ref&gt;Wilton, Katherine. [https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-cross-on-mount-royal-a-storied-history "The cross on Mount Royal: a storied history"]. ''Montreal Gazette'', January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/forbidden-montreal-the-mount-royal-cross-1.1046320 "Forbidden Montreal: The Mount Royal Cross"]. CTV News (Montreal), November 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

An illuminated cross was installed in 1924 by the [[Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste]] and was given to the city in 1929.  Even though the city assumed responsibility for maintenance and operation of the cross since then, no documentation supporting the transaction existed prior to June 2004 when the [[Montreal City Council]] approved cessation of the monument.

The city also took advantage of this to perform additional work to improve access to the site and install new park furniture. The renovations' total cost was $2 million and the bill was footed by the City and by the Ministère de la culture, des communications et de la condition féminine.&lt;ref name="lighting"&gt;Laurence, Jean-Christophe. [http://www.cyberpresse.ca/actualites/regional/montreal/200902/04/01-823922-nouvel-eclairage-pour-la-croix-du-mont-royal.php "Nouvel éclairage pour la croix du mont Royal"]. ''[[La Presse (Canada)|La Presse]]'', February 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cross is made of [[steel]] and consists of 1,830 pieces joined by 6,000 rivets weighing 26 tons. It is 31.4 metres tall and its arms span 11 metres and it stands 252 metres above the [[St. Lawrence River]]. Following the latest renovation, it is lit by 158 18-LED bulbs.&lt;ref name="lighting" /&gt;

The cross is usually lit in white and the new LED system allows it to be any colour, including the purple traditionally used between the death and election of a new [[Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2008/09/18/mtl-montroyalcross0918.html|title=Mount Royal cross gets makeover|date=September 18, 2008|work=CBC News|accessdate=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal]] is the body responsible for informing the city of the death of the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Craig. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060824022337/http://hour.ca/news/brief.aspx?iIDArticle=3438 "Cross to bear"]. Hour Magazine, June 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the installation of the fibre-optic lighting, the purple illumination was accomplished by changing all the light bulbs. It is now controlled by computer.  On various occasions, the cross has been turned red for AIDS awareness and blue for [[Fête nationale du Québec|Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]]. The [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] presented a bit of a dilemma for how the cross would be lit; it was later announced that the cross would be lit in white during the interregnum preceding the election of [[Pope Francis]] on March 13, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/news/canada/montreal/story/2013/02/28/montreal-mount-royal-cross-pope-purple-white.html | title=Mount Royal cross will stay white for Pope's exit | work=[[CBMT|CBC Montreal]] | date=February 28, 2013 | agency=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] | accessdate=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2009, it was turned off for an hour to mark [[Earth Hour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/Montreal+dark+Earth+Hour/1317535/story.html|title=Montreal to go dark for Earth Hour|date=February 22, 2009|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|publisher=Canwest|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225094900/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Montreal+dark+Earth+Hour/1317535/story.html|archive-date=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time capsule==
Next to the cross, a plaque marks the emplacement of a time capsule buried in 1992, during Montreal's 350th birthday celebration. It contains messages and drawings from 12,000 children, depicting their visions for the city in the year 2142, when it is scheduled to be opened.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090423050655/http://www.frommers.com/destinations/montreal/0018020036.html Walking tour: Mount Royal] (''Frommer's'')&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open House London''' is an event which promotes appreciation of [[architecture]] by the general public. It is a part of the organisation Open-City and is best known for its annual Open House Weekend which is a two-day event held on one weekend each September throughout [[London]] since 1992. The event forms a London version of the [[European Heritage Days]] (''Journées Européennes du Patrimoine''), a Europe-wide event that started as ''Journées Portes ouvertes des monuments historiques'' (Historic Monument Open Door Days) in France in 1983. During the Open House Weekend many buildings considered to be of architectural significance open their doors for free public tours. [[Heritage Open Days]] is a similar event covering the rest of England, and takes place the previous weekend to Open House London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritageopendays.org.uk/about/european-roots|title=European roots|author=Heritage Open Days|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Open House event in London is usually held on the third weekend in September. The 2010 event featured over 700 buildings, neighbourhood walks, architects' talks, cycle tours, and more. Well-known buildings not usually open to the public which were open on Open House weekend in 2005, for example, included [[Marlborough House]], [[Lancaster House]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]], the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], and [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]].

Open House Weekend attracts around 250,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/london/open-house-london|title=Open House London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often possible to turn up and go straight into some establishments, although queues are an hour or two long at the most popular buildings, while in other cases admission is by advance booking of a guided tour only.

Organisers also publish the Open House Guide recognised as the biggest architectural publication in the United Kingdom with about 100,000 copies each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openhouselondon.org.uk/about-us/|title=About Open House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the Open House Weekend, Open-City organises other projects including year-round tours, lectures and educational events for children. They also run Green Sky Thinking Week, a programme focused on sustainability held in April of each year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">A '''potash works''' ({{lang-de|Aschenhaus}}, ''Aschenhütte'' or ''Potaschhütte'') was a subsidiary operation of a [[glassworks]] in the [[Early Modern Period]]. The latter needed [[potash]], as well as [[quartz]] and [[calcium carbonate|lime]] as [[raw material]]s for the manufacture of [[glass]]. Potash acted as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in the production process, that is by mixing it with [[quartz sand]] it significantly reduced the [[melting point]] of the latter. To make potash the glassworks built potash huts or works in the vicinity, in which [[wood ash]] and [[vegetable ash]] was gathered by [[ash burner]]s and initially washed in water and then vaporized; the whole process being known as [[leaching (chemistry)|leaching]].

Contemporary witness, teacher and local historian, Lukas Grünenwald, recorded the recollections from his youth in [[Dernbach (Pfalz)|Dernbach]] in the [[Palatinate region]]:&lt;ref name="helmutseebach-2"&gt;Helmut Seebach: ''Altes Handwerk und Gewerbe in der Pfalz.'' Vol. 3: ''Pfälzerwald. Waldbauern, Waldarbeiter, Waldprodukte- und Holzwarenhandel, Waldindustrie und Holztransport.'' Bachstelz-Verlag, Annweiler-Queichhambach et al., 1994, {{ISBN|3-924115-13-3}}, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''These [[potash hut]]s were small, rectangular stone houses with a parlour and kitchen and a wood store above them. In the corner of the kitchen a large, round iron cauldron used for potash boiling stood on the brick stove and a chimney rose from there up to the [[gabled roof]]. In the three walls opposite the entrance were small windows. &lt;br&gt; The requisite [[wood ash]] was bought in all the villages far and wide and often laboriously carried home in sacks on hand carts and wagons on the then still poor roads. In the hut the ashes were first stored cold in grey [[wicker]] baskets, lined with linen, and stood on top of leaching vats. Water was poured over the ashes and they were thoroughly soaked until they were completely leached. &lt;br&gt; The [[mother liquour]] was then boiled on the stove, until only the valuable, white potash was left. This was sold for a high price to the glassworks.''|Lukas Grünenwald, 1875}}

The consumption of wood in the process of making potash was extremely high, which is why the glassworks were frequently established in areas of extensive forest (hence the term [[forest glass]]). For example, the documents of the forest glassworks of [[Spiegelberg]] in the [[Swabian-Franconian Forest]], which was in operation from 1705 to 1822, had an annual demand for potash of approximately 800 [[centner]]s. Because one [[cubic metre]] of wood (750 kg) only produced 1 kg of potash, this glassworks thus needed around 40,000 cubic metres of wood per year.

Even today the names of some settlements still recall the former potash works. For example, two hamlets in the municipality of [[Mainhardt]], Germany, are called ''Aschenhütte''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1435">The '''presbylarynx'''  is a condition in which age-related atrophy of the soft tissues of the [[larynx]] results in weak voice and restricted vocal range and stamina. In other words, it is the loss of [[vocal fold]] tone and elasticity due to aging which affects voice quality.
==Symptoms==
The list of signs and symptoms mentioned in various sources for presbylarynx includes the 4 symptoms listed below: 
# Hoarseness 
# Breathy voice 
# Reduced voice volume 
# Unstable voice pitch 
Note that presbylarynx symptoms usually refers to various symptoms known to a patient, but the phrase "presbylarynx signs" may refer to those signs only noticeable by a doctor.
==Treatment==
The list of treatments mentioned in various sources for presbylarynx includes the following list. Always seek professional medical advice about any treatment or change in treatment plans.

A '''protected area mosaic''', or '''conservation mosaic''' is a collection of environmentally protected areas that are treated as a whole, either formally or informally.
The protected areas may be of different types, including strictly protected areas and sustainable use areas, which may be administered at different public levels or privately.
They may include areas assigned to indigenous people.
A mosaic may be more flexible and effective than an attempt to combine all the areas into a single conservation unit under one agency.
In practice, results with mosaics in different countries have been mixed.

==Definition==

A conservation mosaic may be defined as "a network of protected areas and complementary landscapes that include combinations of national parks (i.e. the core conservation areas), production landscapes and collectively-owned ethnic territories (i.e. the surrounding areas)".{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=x}}
Conservation mosaics are similar to the [[biosphere]]s promoted by [[UNESCO]] under the [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]].{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=4}}
The cooperative approach between different agencies and types of protected area avoids the conflicts and disagreements over land use and conservation that often result with a single agency and single type of conservation unit.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=247}}
The value of creating protected area mosaics has been the subject of intense debate among conservationists.{{sfn|Conservation International|2009|p=21}}
Protected areas are of great importance in protecting biodiversity, but conservation efforts must take into account the social and economic needs of the surrounding communities and the resulting pressure on land usage.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|pp=x–xi}}

==National examples==

===Brazil===
[[File:Amazonas BR-319.jpg|thumb|[[BR-319]]. A protected area mosaic has been defined in an effort to reduce deforestation when the road is paved.]]
{{main article|Protected area mosaic (Brazil)}}
A ''[[Protected area mosaic (Brazil)|mosaico de unidades de conservação]]'' is a legally recognized entity in Brazil, a collection of protected areas of the same or different categories that are near to each other, adjoin each other or overlap, and that should be managed as a whole. It may include conservation units, private lands and indigenous territories.{{sfn|Mosaicos de áreas protegidas – ISA}}
Brazil has created a mosaic of federal and state conservation units along the [[BR-319]] highway through the Amazon rainforest in an effort to better prevent deforestation when the highway is paved through more efficient management of a larger area. 
However, WWF-Brazil has pointed out that it is not enough to simply create the protected areas on paper. 
They must be staffed, delimited, legal owners compensated and so on.{{sfn|Six new protected areas created in Brazilian Amazonian state}}

The [[Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park]] in the state of [[Goiás]], Brazil, was expanded by Federal Decree in September 2001 and inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in December 2001.
In 2003 the expansion was successfully challenged and 72% of the national park lost its protection status.
The park is part of the [[Cerrado Biosphere Reserve]].
Brazil has outlined plans for a mosaic of new conservation units with different management categories covering an equivalent area to the expanded National Park, but [[UNESCO]] has questioned whether the mosaic will be sufficient to ensure the statutory protection required for the World Heritage properties.{{sfn|Cerrado Protected Areas ... UNESCO}}

===Colombia===

A 2015 World Bank report on national protected areas in Colombia covering at least {{convert|2000000|ha}} found that with the mosaic approach ecological connectivity had improved in eight of the mosaics, exceeding the target.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=2}}
The local farmers and fishing communities in seven of the conservation mosaics, which included protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones, benefited from sustainable provision and use of
environmental goods and services.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=3}}

===Kenya===

In northern Kenya the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) organisation covers 19 community conservancies with more than {{convert|3000000|acre}} of wildlife habitat.  
The NRT Council of Elders agreed in May 2010 to found the  Nakuprat – Gotu Community Conservancy beside the [[Shaba National Reserve]] and the [[Ewaso Ng'iro]] river to promote conflict resolution and conserve nature.
The conservancy is part of a protected area mosaic that is a vital habitat for species that include the [[African elephant]] and the endangered [[Grévy's zebra]].{{sfn|Nakuprat Conservancy – Tusk}}

===United Kingdom===

A mosaic of protected areas has evolved in the United Kingdom, with a growing number of types of protected area, some as a result of European Union directives.
The objectives of nature conservation and landscape protection are treated as distinct.
The mosaic has evolved in a manner that results in duplication of effort and funding.
It could benefit from rationalisation and more flexible administration.{{sfn|Bishop|Phillips|Warren}}

===United States===

The protected area mosaics of the [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]], [[El Malpais National Monument|El Malpais]], [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro]] and [[Las Cienegas National Conservation Area|Las Cienegas]] areas in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona have been assembled by a variety of government and non-government organisations to protect the environment while respecting land use demands of the southwest of the United States.
This broad approach to ecosystem planning and management seems more fair and effective than former single-agency approaches.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=245}}
The Great Sand Dunes Monument Area combined various type of protected area to satisfy the objectives of the [[National Park Service]], [[The Nature Conservancy]] and other organizations, and to combine conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem.
The result was similar to the protected area mosaic recommended in the early 1980s for parts of the [[Yukon]] in Canada.
Implementation was staged, with many interactions and adaptations over time.{{sfn|Day|Nelson|Sportza|2003|p=142}}

[[File:Fist.svg|thumb|150px|right|Painted symbol of the Power Fist]]

The '''raised fist''', or the '''clenched fist''', is a [[symbol]] of [[Social solidarity|solidarity]] and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/02/22/every-movement-needs-a-symbol-enter-the-wisconsin-fist-of-solidarity/ |title=Every Movement Needs a Symbol: Enter The Wisconsin Fist of Solidarity |first=Megan |last=Gibson |publisher=Time |date=February 22, 2011 }}{{rs|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a [[salute]] to express unity, strength, defiance, or [[Resistance movement|resistance]]. 

==History==

[[File:Spanish War Children (restored).png|thumb|right|Children preparing for evacuation during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1930s), some giving the Republican salute. The Republicans showed a raised fist whereas the Nationalists gave the [[Roman salute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Calleja |first1=Eduardo Gonzále |chapter=The symbolism of violence during the Second Republic in Spain, 1931–1936 |title=The Splintering of Spain |chapterurl={{Google books|ypBS6N0aFJgC|page=23|plainurl=yes}} |pages=23–44 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511497025.005 |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Ealham |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Richards |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-511-49702-5 |quote=The Roman salute characteristic of Italian fascism was first adopted by the PNE and the JONS, later spreading to the Falange and other extreme right groups, before it became the official salute in Franco's Spain. The JAP salute, which consisted of stretching the right arm horizontally to touch the left shoulder enjoyed only relatively little acceptance. The gesture of the raised fist, so widespread among left-wing workers' groups, gave rise to more regimented variations, such as the salute with the fist on one's temple, characteristic of the German  ''[[Rotfrontkämpferbund|Rotfront]]'', which was adopted by the republican Popular Army. }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A raised fist was used as a [[logo]] by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]&lt;ref&gt;Joyce L. Kornbluh, Solidarity, 1917; Rebel Voices: An IWW Anthology, Charles H. Kerr Publishing, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; (IWW) in 1917. However, it was popularised during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936-1939, when it was used by the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] as a greeting, and was known as the "[[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] salute" or the "[[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] salute". The salute subsequently spread among leftists and anti-fascists across Europe.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17739105 |title=Breivik: What's behind clenched-fist salutes? |last=Kelly |first=Jon |date=17 April 2012 |website=[[bbc.co.uk]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic symbol was popularised in 1948 by [[Taller de Gráfica Popular]], a print shop in [[Mexico]] that used art to advance revolutionary social causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Bancroft/BANC_PIC_2001_206.html|title=Mexican posters on social and educational themes|work=docspopuli.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use spread through the United States in the 1960s after artist and activist [[Frank Cieciorka]] produced a simplified version for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]: this version was subsequently used by [[Students for a Democratic Society]] and the [[Black Power movement]].&lt;ref name=aiga&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aiga.org/not-your-grandparent-s-clenched-fist |title=Not Your Grandparent’s Clenched Fist |last=Patton |first=Phil |date=10 January 2006 |website=[[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raised fist was frequently used in propaganda posters produced during the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 revolt in France]], such as ''La Lutte continue'', depicting a factory chimney topped with a clenched fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rfi.fr/20180404-culture-france-may-68-posters-show-where-they-were-made-beaux-arts-paris |title=France May 68: the art of revolution |last=Hird |first=Alison |date=4 April 2018 |website=[[rfi.fr]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Considine |first1=Liam |date=Autumn 2015 |title=Screen Politics: Pop Art and the Atelier Populaire |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/24/screen-politics-pop-art-and-the-atelier-populaire |journal=Tate Papers |issn=1753-9854 |issue=24 |access-date=7 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/arts/design/may-1968-paris.html |title=Printing a Revolution: The Posters of Paris ’68 |last=Rubin |first=Alissa J. |author-link=Alissa J.

The symbol has been picked up and incorporated around the world by various [[oppression|oppressed]] groups. In 2015 it has emerged in the southeast area of Ukraine among the [[separatists]] battling the Ukraine Kiev government forces, along with the phrase "¡No Pasarán!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Senesi |first=Vauro |date=19 January 2015 |title=Viaggio in Ucraina: al fronte di Lugansk con i ribelli filorussi.

The image gallery shows how a raised fist is used in [[visual communication]]. Combined with another [[graphic design|graphic element]], a raised fist is used to convey [[polysemous]] [[gesture]]s and opposing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hat4PMRx7lUC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=raised%20fist&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=raised%20fist&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Meaning in Gesture|first=Geneviève|last=Calbris|date=1 January 2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|accessdate=16 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the elements combined, the meaning of the gesture changes in [[Tone (literature)|tone]] and [[intention]]. For example, a [[hammer and sickle]] combined with a raised fist is part of [[communist symbolism]], while the same fist combined with a [[Venus symbol]] represents [[Feminism]], and combined with a [[book]], it represents [[librarian]]s.

A raised-fist icon appears prominently as a feminist symbol on the covers of two major books by [[Robin Morgan]], ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful]]'', published in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinmorgan.us/robin_morgan_bookDetails.asp?ProductID=9 Author's website], as accessed September 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sisterhood Is Forever'', in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinmorgan.us/robin_morgan_bookDetails.asp?ProductID=7 Author's website], as accessed September 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol had been popularised in the feminist movement during the [[Miss America protest]] in 1968 which Morgan co-organised.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The raised fist logo may represent unity or solidarity, generally with oppressed peoples. The black fist, also known as the [[Black Power]] fist is a logo generally associated with [[black nationalism]] and sometimes [[socialism]]. Its most widely known usage is by the [[Black Panther Party]] in the 1960s. A black fist logo was also adopted by the [[northern soul]] music [[subculture]]. The white fist, also known as the Aryan fist or the [[White Supremacy|White Power]] fist is a logo generally associated with [[white nationalism]].

A white fist holding a red rose is used by the [[Socialist International]] and some socialist or [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties, such as the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party in France]] and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

[[Ulster loyalism|Loyalists]] in [[Northern Ireland]] occasionally use a red clenched fist on [[Northern Irish murals|murals]] depicting the [[Red Hand of Ulster]]. However, this is considered rare; the red hand is usually depicted with a flat palm.

[[Irish Republicans]] often have the raised fist as a symbol of resistance against British rule.

The Gonzo fist emblem is characterized by two thumbs and four fingers holding a [[peyote]] button, was originally used in [[Hunter S. Thompson|Hunter S. Thompson's]] 1970 campaign for sheriff of [[Aspen, Colorado]]. It has become a symbol of Thompson and [[gonzo journalism]] as a whole.

The [[Unicode]] character for the raised fist is {{unichar|270A}}.

==Salute==
{{Disputed section|date=February 2016}}
The raised fist salute consists of raising one arm in the air with a clenched fist. The meaning can vary based on context.

[[Image:Raised Fist at antiwar demo.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|February 15, 2003]]: A woman raises her fist in solidarity with protestors opposing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].]]

Different movements sometimes use different terms to describe the raised fist salute: amongst communists and socialists, it is sometimes called the red salute, whereas amongst some African-American activists, especially in the United States it has been called the [[Black Power]] salute. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], it was sometimes known as the [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] salute.

The clenched fist gesture is sometimes thought to have originated in the [[Spanish Civil War]], where the Popular Front salute was at one time the standard salute of Republican forces. A letter from the Spanish Civil War stated: "...the raised fist which greets you in Salud is not just a gesture—it means life and liberty being fought for and a greeting of solidarity with the democratic peoples of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, Mary. Letter to Leo Hurwitz and Janey Dudley, 25 November 1938. Reprinted in Cary Nelson and Jefferson Hendricks, eds. "Madrid 1937: Letters of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade from the Spanish Civil War," Routledge: 1996. Reprinted online [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/scw/letters.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rotfrontkämpferbund]] [[paramilitary]] organization of [[Communist Party of Germany]] used the salute before [[World War II]] as a probable counter-gesture to the fascist salute.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, Gottfried: "Symbolgeschichte als Sozialgeschichte? Zehn vorläufige Notizen zu den Bild- und Zeichensystemen sozialer Bewegungen in Deutschland", in: Warneken, Bernd Jürgen (Hg.): "Massenmedium Strasse. Zur Kulturgeschichte der Demonstrationen." Frakfurt/Main 1991. S. 27–28. Cited in: Schulte-Rummel, Sven "Die politische Symbolik der Kommunistischen Partei Deutschlands in der Weimarer Republlik" [http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/vorschau/95026.html].
"Im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Symbolen der Kommunisten beginnt die Geschichte der geballten Faust in der Ära der Weimarer Republik. Sie war prägendes Symbol bei Straßenaufmärschen, Spiegel der gewaltbereiten Demonstranten, die voller Frust über das System dem Staat die geballte Faust zeigten." Translation: "Unlikely the most of other Communists symbols, the history of Raised fist started in the era of Weimar Republic. It was a definitive symbol of street marches, reflection of the marchers who were ready for violence, who were disappointed by the whole system of the state and showed their clenched fists to it."&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], medal winners [[John Carlos]] and [[Tommie Smith]] [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|gave the raised fist salute]] during the American [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] as a sign of black power, and as a protest on behalf of the Olympic Project for Human Rights. For this, they were banned from further Olympic activities. The event was one of the most overtly political statements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html | publisher=[[The Sunday Times]] | last=Lewis | first=Richard | date=2006-10-08 | title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 | accessdate=2008-11-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games]]. Tommie Smith stated in his autobiography, "Silent Gesture", that the salute was not a Black Power salute, but in fact a [[human rights]] salute.

[[Nelson Mandela]] also used the clenched fist salute upon his release from [[Victor Verster Prison]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

A raised White fist is also a popular [[White nationalism#White power|White Power]] symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/raised-fist-salute-has-varied-meanings/ |title=Raised-Fist Salute Has Varied Meanings |first=J. David |last=Goodman |date=April 16, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian right-wing terrorist [[Anders Behring Breivik]] made a clenched-fist salute upon his conviction. Similarly [[Carlos the Jackal]] used the gesture in court, and [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] raised his fist to photographers after his arrest for the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The raised fist is used by officials in Mainland China when being sworn into office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.gov.cn/premier/news/2016/09/18/content_281475445040096.htm|title=State Council holds first swearing-in ceremony to uphold Constitution|work=english.gov.cn|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] has suggested that the appeal of the salute is that it allows the individual to indicate that they "intend to meet malevolent, massive institutional force with force of (their) own", and that they are bound in struggle with others against common oppression.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

A '''roast''' is a form of American humor in which a specific individual, a guest of honor, is subjected to jokes at their expense, intended to amuse the event's wider audience. Such events are intended to honor a specific individual in a unique way. In addition to jokes and [[insult comedy]], such events may also involve genuine praise and [[tribute]]s. The implication is that the '''roastee''' is able to take the jokes in good humor and not as serious criticism or insult. The individual is surrounded by friends, fans, and well-wishers, who can receive some of the same treatment as well during the course of the evening. The party and presentation itself are both referred to as a "roast". The host of the event is called the "'''roastmaster'''". Anyone who is mocked in such a way is said to have been "roasted".

==The Friars Club==
"FRIARS KID MR. HARRIS: Veteran Theatrical Manager Butt of Jokes at Dinner" read the headline of the December 10, 1910 issue of the ''New York Tribune''.

In 1949, the [[New York Friars Club]] held their first roast, with [[Maurice Chevalier]] as the guest of honor.&lt;ref name=FriarsClubHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friarsclub.com/sample-page-2/|title=History // Friars Club|publisher=Friars Club |accessdate=2014-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Televised roasts==
===''Kraft Music Hall''===
The final few seasons of the television show ''[[Kraft Music Hall (TV series)|Kraft Music Hall]]'', from 1968 to 1971, included broadcasts of the Friars Club Roast; the celebrities roasted included [[Johnny Carson]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Don Rickles]], and [[Jerry Lewis]].

===Dean Martin's Celebrity Roasts===
[[Dean Martin]] hosted a series of roasts on television in 1974 as part of the final season of [[The Dean Martin Show|his self-titled variety show]]. After the show was cancelled, NBC decided to schedule a series of ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' specials from the former MGM Grand Hotel and Casino (now [[Bally's Las Vegas]]) in the Ziegfeld Room; these were recorded and aired approximately once every two months from late 1974 to early 1979, and another three were produced in 1984. The celebrities roasted included actors [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Bette Davis]], and [[Jimmy Stewart]]; athletes [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Joe Namath]], and [[Wilt Chamberlain]]; comedians [[Lucille Ball]], [[Jackie Gleason]], and [[Redd Foxx]]; politicians [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Barry Goldwater]]; and singers [[Frank Sinatra]] and Martin himself. The humor at these broadcast tributes was far tamer than the sometimes extremely vulgar and explicit language of the private, non-televised ones.

===Comedy Central===
{{Main|Comedy Central Roast}}
From 1998 to 2002, the cable channel [[Comedy Central]] produced and broadcast the annual roast of the New York Friars Club, with roasts of the celebrities [[Drew Carey]], [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[Hugh Hefner]], and [[Chevy Chase]].

Based on the success of these roasts, Comedy Central began hosting their own roasts on an approximately annual basis, under the name ''[[Comedy Central Roast]]''. The first roastee was [[Denis Leary]] in 2003, followed by [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[William Shatner]], [[Flavor Flav]], [[Bob Saget]], [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Donald Trump]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Roseanne Barr]],  [[James Franco]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Rob Lowe]] and [[Bruce Willis]].

Comedian [[Jeff Ross]] notably gained fame through his participation in the televised Comedy Central roasts, and is frequently referred to as the "Roastmaster General"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Roastmaster General: Comedian Jeff Ross on the art of the roast |url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2014/10/02/3275779/roastmaster-general-comedian-jeff.html |work=The Tribune |first=Patrick S. |last=Pemberton |date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a position he in fact holds with the New York Friars' Club).

In 2010, Comedy Central's international affiliates began to produce and air their own local roasts as well. [[Comedy Central (New Zealand)|Comedy Central New Zealand]] has aired two roasts (of [[Mike King (comedian)|Mike King]] and [[Murray Mexted]]), Comedy Central Africa has aired two (of [[Steve Hofmeyr]] and [[Kenny Kunene]]), [[Comedy Central Latin America]] has aired one, of [[Héctor Suárez]], and [[Comedy Central (Netherlands)|Comedy Central Netherlands]] has aired two, of [[Gordon Heuckeroth|Gordon]] (which was the highest-watched broadcast in the history of the channel) and [[Giel Beelen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Comedy Central rijgt meer BN'ers aan het spit na succesvolle Roast van Gordon |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/media/comedy-central-rijgt-meer-bn-ers-aan-het-spit-na-succesvolle-roast-van-gordon~a4438032/ |language=Dutch |website=[[de Volkskrant]] |access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other televised roasts in the United States===
''[[Playboy Enterprises|Playboy]]'' produced one roast in 1986, of [[Tommy Chong]], which aired on the [[Playboy Channel]].

Basketball player [[Shaquille O'Neal]] produced two editions of his ''Shaq's All Star Comedy Roast'': of himself in 2002, and of [[Emmitt Smith]] in 2003.

The cable channel [[MTV]] produced one roast in 2003, of [[Carson Daly]], which was billed as the ''MTV Bash''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GUESTS PLAY IT BLUE AT CARSON DALY ROAST |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/guests-play-blue-carson-daly-roast-article-1.526285 |work=New York Daily News |date=July 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of one of the episodes (Season 5 episode 15) of the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] [[Parks and Recreation]] was the main character Leslie Knope roasting the media of the fictional town of Pawnee in a local [[Correspondents dinner|correspondents lunch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parks and Recreation - Season 5 Episode 15 - "Correspondents lunch"|url=https://www.youtube.com|website=You Tube|publisher=NBC|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Some unsuccessful attempts have been made to adapt the American roast format to a British audience. [[Channel 4]] launched the latest British version on April 7, 2010 with ''[[A Comedy Roast]]'', with initial victims being [[Bruce Forsyth]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], and [[Chris Tarrant]].&lt;ref name=Guardian5Apr2010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/05/comedy-roasts-channel-4 |title=Channel 4 launches comedy roast shows |work=The Guardian |date=5 April 2010 |accessdate=8 April 2010 | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Armstrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Channel4AComedyRoastEpisodeGuide&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/a-comedy-roast/episode-guide |title=A Comedy Roast - Series &amp; Episodes |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=8 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Davina McCall]] and [[Barbara Windsor]] were other victims.

===India===
The [[India]]n comedy group [[All India Bakchod]] organized the live show ''[[All India Bakchod Knockout|AIB Knockout]]'' in January 2015 featuring [[Arjun Kapoor]] and [[Ranveer Singh]] with [[Karan Johar]] as the roastmaster. The programme caused a controversy for allegedly featuring distasteful, sexist, offending and humiliating content. Videos of the event were removed from [[YouTube]], and the state is contemplating a clamp down on future AIB Knockouts, following legal action by some viewers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EinuOwzmFos&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Comedy Nights Bachao]] by Optimystix production&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Copying Kapil will only bring us criticism: Optimystix's producer Vipul D Shah - Times of India|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/Copying-Kapil-will-only-bring-us-criticism-Optimystixs-producer-Vipul-D-Shah/articleshow/50653788.cms|website = The Times of India|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also based on this format; however, they avoid going too racy to keep the show family friendly.

==In politics==
The [[White House Correspondents' Association]] and [[Radio and Television Correspondents' Association]] have annual dinners that, in some years, feature a comedy roasting of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;President. [[Don Imus]] at the RTCA in 1996, [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|Stephen Colbert in 2006]] and [[Michelle Wolf#2018 White House Correspondents' Dinner appearance|Michelle Wolf in 2018]] have received particular attention for their biting remarks during their speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Imus Clout Prompts Political Support |author=John Hendren|work=[[ABC News]]|date=2007-04-11 |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3031440&amp;page=1 |accessdate=April 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.com/2061-10802_3-6068398.html | work=[[Cnet|Cnet News]] | title=Video of Presidential roast attracts big Web audience | first=Greg | last=Sandoval | accessdate=2006-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes-truthiness-bums"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/opinion/05rich.html |work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Throw the Truthiness Bums Out | first=Frank | last=Rich | authorlink=Frank Rich | date=November 5, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-michelle-wolf-blasted-open-the-fictions-of-journalism-in-the-age-of-trump|title=How Michelle Wolf Blasted Open the Fictions of Journalism in the Age of Trump|last=Gessen|first=Masha|date=April 30, 2018|work=The New Yorker|access-date=May 1, 2018|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During presidential election years in the U.S., it is customary for both major party candidates to attend the [[Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner]], typically engaging in a roast of each other, and occasionally themselves.

'''Sāmarrāʾ''' ({{lang-ar|سَامَرَّاء}}) is a city in [[Iraq]]. It stands on the east bank of the [[Tigris]] in the [[Saladin Governorate]], {{convert|125|km|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Baghdad]]. In 2003 the city had an estimated population of 348,700. Samarra was once in the "[[Sunni Triangle]]" of violence during the [[sectarian violence in Iraq (2006–07)]].

In the [[medieval]] times, Samarra was the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the only remaining Islamic capital that retains its original plan, architecture and artistic relics.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Samarra Archaeological City, http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/276&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[UNESCO]] named Samarra one of its [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6248244.stm | publisher=[[BBC News]] | title=Unesco names World Heritage sites | date=2007-06-28 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient Samarra===
[[Image:FemaleStatuetteSamarra6000BCE.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female statuette, Samarra, 6000 BC]]
[[File:Samarra bowl.jpg|thumb|upright|The Samarra bowl at the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin. The [[swastika]] in the center of the design is a reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley A. Freed, ''Research Pitfalls as a Result of the Restoration of Museum Specimens'', Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, Volume 376, The Research Potential of Anthropological Museum Collections pages 229–245, December 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Chinese sancai sherd 9th 10th century found in Samarra.jpg|thumb|upright|Chinese-made [[sancai]] pottery shard, 9-10th century, found in Samarra, an example of [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery]]. [[British Museum]].]]

The remains of [[prehistoric]] Samarra were first excavated between 1911 and 1914 by the German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld]]. Samarra became the [[type site]] for the [[Samarra culture]]. Since 1946, the notebooks, letters, unpublished excavation reports and photographs have been in the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in Washington, DC.

The civilization flourished alongside the [[Ubaid period]], as one of the first town states in the [[Near East]]. It lasted from 5,500 BCE and eventually collapsed in 3,900 BCE.

A city of '''Sur-marrati''' (refounded by [[Sennacherib]] in 690 BC according to a [[stele]] in the [[Walters Art Museum]]) is insecurely identified with a fortified [[Assyria]]n site of Assyrian at al-Huwaysh on the Tigris opposite modern Samarra. The State Archives of Assyria Online identifies ''Surimarrat'' as the modern site of Samarra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/cbd/qpn/qpn.x030705.html SAAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient place names for Samarra noted by the Samarra Archaeological Survey are Greek ''Souma'' ([[Ptolemy]] V.19, [[Zosimus]] III, 30), Latin ''Sumere'', a fort mentioned during the retreat of the army of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] in 363 AD ([[Ammianus Marcellinus]] XXV, 6, 4), and Syriac ''Sumra'' (Hoffmann, ''Auszüge'', 188; [[Michael the Syrian]], III, 88), described as a village.

The possibility of a larger population was offered by the opening of the Qatul al-Kisrawi, the northern extension of the [[Nahrawan Canal]] which drew water from the [[Tigris]] in the region of Samarra, attributed by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] (''Muʿjam'', see under "Qatul") to [[Khosrau I]] (531–578). To celebrate the completion of this  project, a commemorative tower (modern Burj al-Qa'im) was built at the southern inlet south of Samarra, and a palace with a "paradise" or walled hunting park was constructed at the northern inlet (modern Nahr ar-Rasasi) near [[ad-Dawr]].  A supplementary canal, the Qatul Abi al-Jund, excavated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], was commemorated by a planned city laid out in the form of a regular octagon (modern Husn al-Qadisiyya), called al-Mubarak and abandoned unfinished in 796.

===Abbasid capital===
{{Main|Abbasid Samarra}}
[[File:Dirhem of al-Muntasir, AH 247-248.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dirham]] of [[Al-Muntasir]] minted in Samarra, 861/862 AD]]
In 836 [[Common Era|CE]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mu'tasim]] founded a new capital at the banks of the Tigris. Here he built extensive palace complexes surrounded by garrison settlements for his guards, mostly drawn from [[Central Asia]] and [[Iran]] (most famously the [[Turkish People|Turks]], as well as the Khurasani ''[[Ishtakhaniyya]]'', ''[[Faraghina]]'' and ''[[Ushrusaniyya]]'' regiments) or North Africa (like the ''[[Maghariba (Abbasid troops)|Maghariba]]''). Although quite often called [[Mamluk]] slave soldiers, their status was quite elevated; some of their commanders bore Sogdian titles of nobility.&lt;ref name="Babaie"&gt;{{cite book | title=Slaves of the Shah | publisher=I.B.Tauris &amp; Co Ltd | author=Babaie, Sussan | year=2004 | location=New York | pages=4–5 | isbn=1 86064 721 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was further developed under Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]], who sponsored the construction of lavish palace complexes, such as al-Mutawakkiliyya, and the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] with its famous spiral [[minaret]] or Malwiya, built in 847. For his son [[al-Mu'tazz]] he built the large palace Bulkuwara.

Samarra remained the residence of the caliph until 892, when [[al-Mu'tadid]] eventually returned to Baghdad. The city declined but maintained a mint until the early 10th century.

The Nestorian patriarch [[Sargis (Nestorian Patriarch)|Sargis]] (860–72) moved the patriarchal seat of the [[Church of the East]] from Baghdad to Samarra, and one or two of his immediate successors may also have sat in Samarra so as to be close to the seat of power.&lt;ref&gt;Mari, 80–1 (Arabic), 71–2 (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the long decline of the Abbasid empire, 940 Samarra was largely abandoned starting in AD 940. Its population returned to Baghdad and the city rapidly declined. Its field of ruins is the only world metropolis of late antiquity which is available for serious archaeology.

===Religious significance===
{{See also|Iraq in the Quran}}
[[File:AL-ASKARIYYAIN SHRINE IN SAMARRA.jpg|thumb|left|Shrine of Al-Askari]]
The city is also home to [[al-Askari Shrine]], containing the mausolea of the [[Imam]]s [[Ali al-Hadi]] and [[Hasan al-Askari]], the tenth and eleventh [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)#The Shi.27a Twelvers|Shiʿi Imams]], respectively, as well as the place from where [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], known as the "Hidden Imam", reportedly went into [[The Occultation]] in the belief of the [[Twelver]] or [[Shias]]. This has made it an important pilgrimage centre for the Imami Shias. In addition, Hakimah and [[Narjis]], female relatives of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and the Imams, held in high esteem by Muslims, are buried there, making this mosque one of the most significant sites of worship.

===Modern era===
[[File:Les dômes de Samarra en 1970 (2).jpg|thumb|left|Men walk down a street in Samarra in 1970]]
In the eighteenth century, one of the most violent battles of the 1730–1735 [[Ottoman–Persian War (1730–35)|Ottoman–Persian War]], the [[Battle of Samarra (1733)|Battle of Samarra]], took place, where over 50,000 Turks and Persians became casualties. The engagement decided the fate of Ottoman Iraq and kept it under Istanbul's suzerainty until the First World War.

During the 20th century, Samarra gained new importance when a permanent lake, [[Lake Tharthar]], was created through the construction of the [[Samarra Barrage]], which was built in order to prevent the frequent flooding of Baghdad. Many local people were displaced by the dam, resulting in an increase in Samarra's population.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Samarra is a key city in Saladin Governorate, a major part of the so-called [[Sunni Triangle]] where insurgents were active during the [[Iraq War]].

Though Samarra is famous for its Shi'i holy sites, including the tombs of several Shi'i Imams, the town was traditionally and until very recently, dominated by Sunni Arabs.  Tensions arose between Sunnis and the Shi'a during the Iraq War. On February 22, 2006, the golden dome of the [[al-Askari Mosque]] was [[2006 al-Askari Shrine bombing|bombed]], setting off a period of rioting and reprisal attacks across the country which claimed hundreds of lives. No organization claimed responsibility for the bombing. On June 13, 2007, insurgents [[2007 al-Askari Mosque bombing|attacked the mosque]] again and destroyed the two [[minaret]]s that flanked the dome's ruins.&lt;ref name="Ricks2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E. Ricks|title=The Gamble: General Petraeus and the American Military Adventure in Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHMJCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT3|date=6 January 2010|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-19206-1|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12, 2007, the clock tower was blown up. No fatalities were reported. Shiʿi cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] called for peaceful demonstrations and three days of mourning.&lt;ref name="rfer_Expl"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Explosion Topples Minarets At Iraqi Shi'ite Shrine | work = RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty | date = 2007-06-13 | accessdate = 2015-08-22 | url = http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1077098.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he believed no Sunni [[Arabs|Arab]] could have been behind the attack, though according to the ''New York Times'' the attackers were likely Sunnis linked to Al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name="nyti_Seve"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Several Mosques Attacked, but Iraq Is Mostly Calm - New York Times | author1 = John F.

Ever since the end of Iraqi civil war in 2007, the Shia population of the holy city has increased exponentially. However, violence has continued, with bombings taking place in [[2011 Samarra bombing|2011]] and [[20 September Samarra attack|2013]].

The metaphor of "Having an appointment in Samarra", signifying death, is a literary reference to an ancient Babylonian myth recorded in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] and transcribed by [[W. Somerset Maugham]],&lt;ref&gt;"The Appointment in Samarra" (as retold by W. Somerset Maugham [1933]).&lt;/ref&gt; in which Death narrates a man's futile attempt to escape him by fleeing from Baghdad to Samarra.  The story "The Appointment in Samarra" subsequently formed the germ of a [[Appointment in Samarra|novel of the same name]] by [[John O'Hara]].&lt;ref&gt;John O'Hara, ''Appointment in Samarra'', Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1934. {{ISBN|0-375-71920-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The original story was retold in verse by [[F. L. Lucas]] in his poem "The Destined Hour" in ''From Many Times and Lands'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., "The Destined Hour" in ''From Many Times and Lands'' (London, 1953); reprinted in ''Every Poem Tells a Story: A Collection of Stories in Verse'', ed. Raymond Wilson (London, 1988; {{ISBN|0-670-82086-5}} / 0-670-82086-5).&lt;/ref&gt; The story is told in "[[The Six Thatchers]]", a 2017 episode of ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]''.

'''''Star Athletica, LLC v. Varsity Brands, Inc.''''', 580 U.S. ___ (2017), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case in which the Court decided under what circumstances aesthetic elements of "useful articles" can be restricted by [[copyright]] law. The Court created a two-prong "separability" test, granting copyrightability on conditions of separate identification and independent existence. In other words, the aesthetic elements must be identifiable as art if mentally separated from the article's practical use and must qualify as copyrightable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works if expressed in any medium.

The case concerned a dispute between two clothing manufacturers, [[Star Athletica]] and [[Varsity Brands]]. Star Athletica began creating [[cheerleading uniform]]s with [[Stripe (pattern)|stripes]], [[zigzag]]s, and [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] insignia similar to some made by Varsity, produced at a far lower price point. Varsity sued Star Athletica for [[copyright infringement]] and Star Athletica claimed the clothing designs were uncopyrightable because their aesthetic designs were tied so closely to and guided by their utilitarian purposes as uniforms. The Court rejected this argument with a close reading of the statute and established that the clothing designs, as aesthetic elements of the useful article of clothing, could be copyrightable. The Court had declined to hear Star Athletica's follow-up question concerning whether Varsity's specific designs were original enough to be copyrightable, so that part of the case remained unaddressed and Varsity's copyright registrations stood.

The Court's conclusion that aesthetic elements of useful articles, and thereby clothing design elements, could be copyrighted excited [[fashion designer]]s and [[intellectual property]] scholars. Some loved the decision because they saw extending copyright to clothes as parity with other [[creative industries]] that had enjoyed copyrights for much longer. Others denounced the Court's opinion over ambiguities in how to enforce the new rules and because of its potential to end [[Fad|fashion trends]] in generic clothing.

==Background==
===Historical copyrightability and Varsity Brands===
At one time, clothing designs were [[Copyright law of the United States#Works subject to copyright law|not subject to copyright law]], or "uncopyrightable," in the United States. In 1941, the Court heard ''[[Fashion Originators' Guild of America v. FTC]]'', which considered the [[fashion industry]]'s practice of boycotting sale of their "high fashion" works at places that would sell knock-offs made by other companies for lower prices, so-called "style piracy". The court ruled against [[Fashion Originators' Guild of America|the Guild]], saying that this practice of attempting to create a [[monopoly]] outside of the copyright system suppressed [[Free market|free competition]] and violated the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|312|457|1941|name=Fashion Originators' Guild of America v. FTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, outside fashion, ''[[Mazer v. Stein]]'' established in 1954 that an artistic statue created to adorn a lamp base could be copyrightable separately from the utilitarian lamp under expansions from the [[Copyright Act of 1909]]. The statue's mass-production alongside the lamp did not invalidate that.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|347|201|1954|name=Mazer v. Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another barrier to copyrightability in the United States is a certain vague [[Threshold of originality#United States|threshold of originality]] that must be met to be eligible for an intellectual property monopoly like a copyright or [[patent]]. In 1964's ''[[Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.]]'', the Court agreed with a lower court's ruling that Stiffel's popular lamp design was not original enough to warrant a patent preventing the lamp's sale by [[Sears]], rescinding that restriction and passing the design to the [[public domain]]. The Court's opinion indicated that the same logic would apply to an inappropriate copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|376|225|1964|name=Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] changed the copyright law to allow copyrighting aesthetic features of "useful articles,"&lt;ref name="HLR"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2017/11/star-athletica-l-l-c-v-varsity-brands-inc/ |title=Star Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc. |date=2017-11-04 |website=Harvard Law Review |access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information."&lt;ref name="17USC101"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|101}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was intended to better incorporate the ''Mazer v. Stein'' ruling&lt;ref name ="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Robert Kastenmeier |author-link=Robert Kastenmeier |url=https://www.copyright.gov/history/law/clrev_94-1476.pdf |date=1976-09-03 |title=House of Representatives Report No. 94-1476 |publisher=United States House of Representatives |page=105 |access-date=2018-07-21 |quote=Section 113 deals with the extent of copyright protection in "works of applied art."

The Act said "pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features" of useful articles were copyrightable only if "separable" from the utilitarian aspects of the design and capable of existing independently of the article.&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Fromer |first=Jeanne C. |last2=McKenna |first2=Mark P. |date=2018-05-30 |title=Claiming Design |journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review |volume=167 |ssrn=3186762}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broad definitional language lead to a proliferation of about ten competing, inconsistent legal tests for that separability,&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ginsburg |first=Jane C. |date=2016-09-01 |title='Courts Have Twisted Themselves into Knots': US Copyright Protection for Applied Art |url=https://lawandarts.org/article/courts-have-twisted-themselves-into-knots-u-s-copyright-protection-for-applied-art/ |journal=The Columbia Journal of Law &amp; the Arts |language=en |location=Rochester, NY |volume=40 |issue=1 |ssrn=2837728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2016/05/02/supreme-court-dives-into-copyright-fight-over-cheerleader-uniforms/#224b16325244 |title=Supreme Court Dives Into Copyright Fight Over Cheerleader Uniforms |last=Fisher |first=Daniel |date=2016-05-02 |website=Forbes |language=en |access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state of affairs criticized for appearing to have judges serve as art critics.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;

Because clothes have both aesthetic and utilitarian features in their designs, they fall under this useful article category; therefore, the shapes and cuts of clothing are not copyrightable. Designs placed on clothing were opened up to the possibility of copyrightability, subject to those tests.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt; Practically, the law was construed to mean that copyrighted two-dimensional designs could be placed on clothing, and fabric pattern sheets could be copyrighted before being cut to make clothing, but an article of clothing's overall color scheme and design could not be copyrighted because it was not capable of existing independently of the final useful article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line--&gt; |date=December 22, 2014 |title=''Compendium of US Copyright Office Practices, Third Edition'' |url=https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium-12-22-14.pdf |publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]] |page=41 |section=924.3(A) Clothing Designs |access-date=July 11, 2018 |quote=Clothing such as shirts, dresses, pants, coats, shoes, and outerwear are not eligible for copyright protection because they are considered useful articles.

The Office approved&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"/&gt; over 200&lt;ref name=slipop1&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 1.&lt;/ref&gt; of these narrowly-defined copyrights with descriptions like "has a central field of black bordered at the bottom by a gray/white/black multistripe forming a shallow 'vee' of which the left-hand leg is horizontal, while the right-hand leg stretches 'northeast' at approximately a forty-five degree angle." Varsity proceeded to frequently file lawsuits alleging infringement via accusations of very general copying,&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"/&gt; intended to stop other companies from releasing competing uniforms.

===Star Athletica lawsuit===
[[File:Uniform designs at issue in Star Athletica v Varsity Brands.png|thumb|left&lt;!-- to avoid conflict with the infobox --&gt;|The five cheerleading uniform designs involved in the case]]
Star Athletica was founded in January 2010 as a subsidiary of The Liebe Company. Varsity Brands accused Star Athletica of being created in retaliation for Varsity cancelling a deal with The Liebe Company's sports lettering subsidiary, aided by former Varsity employees knowledgeable about Varsity designs. Later that year,&lt;ref name="WhoOwnsCheerleaderUniforms"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/sports/who-owns-cheerleader-uniform-designs-its-up-to-the-supreme-court.html |title=Who Owns Cheerleader Uniform Designs? It’s up to the Supreme Court |last=Smith |first=Erin Geiger |date=2016-10-31 |website=The New York Times |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varsity Brands filed suit against Star Athletica for infringing five of its copyrighted designs for cheerleading uniforms.&lt;ref name="slipop2quote"&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2 (quoting [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=%22Star+Athletica%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=40006&amp;case=7992815185039286726&amp;scilh=0 2014 WL 819422], *8-*9 (WD Tenn., Mar. 1, 2014)).&lt;/ref&gt; The Star Athletica designs were not exactly identical, physically or graphically, but Varsity's general description of allegedly copied elements in court filings, "the lines, stripes, coloring, angles, V’s [or chevrons], and shapes and the arrangement and placement of those elements," suited both designs and the case moved forward.&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"/&gt; Varsity also sued for [[trademark infringement]] under the [[Lanham Act]]&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt; and Star Athletica counter-sued Varsity under the Sherman Antitrust Act for allegedly monopolizing the cheerleading industry,&lt;ref name="VarsityBrief"&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/15-866-respondent-merits.pdf Brief of the Respondents] (Sep. 14, 2016), Star Athletica, LLC v.

In 2014, the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee]] ruled Star Athletica's favor on the grounds that the designs were not eligible for copyright restriction. According to [[United States federal judge|Judge]] [[Robert Hardy Cleland]], a design without the distinctive marks like chevrons and zigzags would not identifiable as cheerleading uniforms, so the designs were not separately identifiable. They were not conceptually separable because the marks, if viewed outside the context of the clothing, would have still evoked the idea of a cheerleading uniform.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Varsity Brands, Inc. v.

The district court's decision was reversed on [[appeal]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] with the majority of Judge [[Karen Nelson Moore]] joined by Judge [[Ralph B. Guy Jr.]]. Firstly, Moore said the district court should have deferred to the fact that the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]]'s trained personnel had granted the copyright registrations in the first place. On the questions of the case, Moore evaluated the competing separability tests, but ended up creating a new five-step test for the Circuit's analysis. In short, they found that the designs were copyrightable because  the clothes had the utility of being athletic wear and removing the designs did not affect that utility. She said the design could be separately identifiable because it could be held "side by side" with a blank dress and there would be no utilitarian difference, and it could certainly exist independently because the individual aspects like chevrons could appear in designs on other clothing items. Moore also said that a ruling in favor of Star Athletica would have rendered all paintings uncopyrightable because they decorated the rooms where they hung. Judge [[David McKeague]] dissented because of a disagreement over the application of one of the test's steps. The third step asked the court to determine the useful article's "utilitarian aspects." Instead of the majority's more general assessment of athletic wear, McKeague would have defined the uniforms as clothing the body "in an attractive way for a special occasion" and "identify[ing] the wearer as a cheerleader;" therefore, the aesthetic features could not be separated from the utilitarian to him.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Varsity Brands, Inc. v.

Star Athletica filed to be heard by the United States Supreme Court in January 2016. On May 2, 2016 the Court granted ''[[certiorari]]'' "to resolve widespread disagreement over the proper test for implementing §&amp;nbsp;101's separate-identification and independent-existence requirements." Star Athletica also wanted the Court to decide if Varsity's specific designs were sufficiently original to be copyrighted, but the Court declined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-866.htm ''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 1; see also ''No. 15-866'' (docket), United States Supreme Court] (last visited April 15, 2017) ("May 2, 2016 Petition GRANTED limited to Question 1 presented by the petition.")&lt;/ref&gt;

In their view, copyrighting the uniform designs would unduly stretch Congress's intent to copyright minor detailing on industrial designs like floral engravings on silverware, carvings in the backs of chairs, or prints on t-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Star-Athletica.pdf Brief of Intellectual Property Professors as ''Amicus Curiae''], ''Star Athletica, LLC v.

Varsity received an endorsement from the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]], which believed that extending copyright to clothing designs was critical to prevent exploitative copyists and preserve the United States's rapid rate of expansion in the worldwide fashion industry, representing $370 billion in domestic consumer spending and 1.8 million jobs.&lt;ref name="CouncilBrief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WhoOwnsCheerleaderUniforms"/&gt; The [[Fashion Law Institute]] shared these interests and advised that a decision to copyright clothing designs would be a proper reading of the ''Mazer v.

In part, the government claimed that the question of a proper separability analysis was unnecessary because, in creating the designs as drawings, Varsity had received a copyright for them and reserved the exclusive ability to reproduce that design however they chose in any medium. They pointed to a concession from Star Athletica that if, hypothetically, Varsity controlled ''[[The Starry Night]]'', Varsity would be able to restrict the printing of the painting on dresses.&lt;ref name="UnitedStatesBrief"&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/15-866_amicus_respondent_united_states.pdf Brief of United States as ''Amicus Curiae''], ''Star Athletica, LLC v.

The government also argued that, in applying the requested conceptual separability analysis, what mattered was that a uniform stripped of the design "remain[ed] similarly useful" when compared to the original.

Star Athletica's lawyers gave the Court examples of how the graphic designs were utilitarian. For instance, the colors and shapes were arranged to create [[optical illusion|optical effects]] like the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] and deliberately change the cheerleader's appearance to make them appear taller, thinner, and generally more appealing. They considered this distinct from applying a pre-existing two-dimensional image to the uniform because the lines required for those illusions to function needed to be properly located on properly fitted uniforms.&lt;ref name="ViewFromTheCourtroom" /&gt; According to them, people often made those sorts of deliberately utilitarian decisions about their clothing to make themselves look better or happier.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/in-a-copyright-case-justices-ponder-the-fashion-industry.html |title=In a Copyright Case, Justices Ponder the Meaning of Fashion |last=Liptak |first=Adam |publisher=The New York Times |date=October 31, 2016 |website=The New York Times |access-date=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, were those designs placed on another object, such as a lunchbox, they would not be serving that utilitarian purpose anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/303599-justice-weigh-cheerleading-uniform-designs |title=Justices weigh cheerleading uniform designs |last=Balluck |first=Kyle |date=2016-10-31 |website=TheHill |language=en |access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Associate Justice|Justice]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], in particular, rejected that line of argument, citing the fact that the examples presented in evidence were two-dimensional works. In her view, it did not matter that the submitted designs were "superimposed" on three-dimensional uniforms&amp;mdash;the designs were submitted in two-dimensional images, so the designs were separated from the uniforms and copyrightable. After all, both parties agreed that the physical, three-dimensional uniform's cut and how it physically framed the body was not copyrightable. They were interested in the colors and aesthetic designs that were applied to the useful article.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31/&gt; She was not comfortable with vagueness she perceived in how Star Athletica wanted the Court to decide when a given two-dimensional design "is what makes an article utilitarian" when that design could conceivably be placed on anything.&lt;ref name="ArgumentAnalysisJusticesWorry"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/11/argument-analysis-justices-worry-about-killing-knockoffs-with-copyright/ |title=Argument analysis: Justices worry about 'killing knockoffs with copyright' |last=Mann |first=Ronald |date=2016-11-01 |publisher=SCOTUSblog |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] felt much the same and added that the designs did more than sit practically on the body because they sent a "particular message" that distinguished it from a blank dress, namely that the wearer was "a member of a cheerleading squad." Receiving this expression leaned him toward thinking of it as copyrightable expression.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31/&gt;

The members of the Court also considered more abstract aspects of the case. For example, it was unclear how a decision in Varsity's favor might affect military-style [[camouflage]] patterns and whether or not they could be restricted if fashion designs were copyrightable. Varsity supported the idea of camouflage copyrights, although Justice [[Elena Kagan]] pointed out the clear utilitarian function of camouflage patterns: concealment. On the industry side, women's fashion alone was a concern worth hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide. Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] speculated that the price of dresses could conceivably double if copyright terms were applied to designs and knock-off brands couldn't compete at lower prices.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31 /&gt; Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and he questioned Varsity over their concerns of monopolization effects, such as a uniform design becoming part of a school's brand identity and compelling them to buy exclusively from Varsity during a century of copyright restriction. In the end, Breyer expressed worry that designers or lawyers might resort to simply copyrighting drawings to sue over the design of any dress or suit.&lt;ref name="ArgumentAnalysisJusticesWorry"/&gt; Sotomayor, formerly a representative of [[Fendi]] in cases brought against knock-offs, wondered aloud if a decision for Varsity would destroy those knock-offs brands, although she was not sure if that would be a bad thing.&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtHearsArguments"/&gt; Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wondered whether it was "the domain of copyright to [restrict] the way people present themselves to the world."&lt;ref name="ArgumentAnalysisJusticesWorry"/&gt;

Breyer also got attention in the media for his aphorism about the purpose of fashion, "The clothes on the hanger do nothing; the clothes on the woman do everything." Kagan thought the sentiment was "so romantic."&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtHearsArguments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ViewFromTheCourtroom" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTOct31/&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
===Majority opinion===
Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] delivered the majority opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices [[Samuel Alito|Alito]], Sotomayor, and Kagan.&lt;ref name ="HLR"/&gt; The Court defined its task as "whether the lines, chevrons, and colorful shapes appearing on the surface of [Varsity Brands'] cheerleading uniforms are eligible for copyright restriction as separable features of the design of those cheerleading uniforms."&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court did not consider whether the designs in the case actually met copyright restriction's threshold of originality.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/03/22/copyrights-supreme-court-star-athletica-v-varsity-brands/id=79767/ |title=Copyrights at the Supreme Court: Star Athletica v. Varsity Brands |last=Quinn |first=Gene  |last2=Brachmann |first2=Steve |date=2017-03-22 |website=IPWatchdog |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas rejected arguments from Varsity and the United States that separability analysis was unneeded,&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; but also did away with all the lower court tests used previously. Instead, the opinion provided one canonical two-part test based on the statute and the ''Mazer v. Stein'' decision:&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...an artistic feature of the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection if the feature '''(1)''' can be perceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article and '''(2)''' would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work either on its own or in some other medium if imagined separately from the useful article.&lt;ref name=slipop11&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After applying this test to the cheerleading uniforms, the Court ruled in Varsity's favor that the designs were separable from the useful article and could be copyrighted.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop10&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The separability analysis started with the admittedly permissive first requirement, identifying the designs as separately identifiable "pictoral, graphical, or sculptural works." The design needed to be able to exist independently, and Thomas concluded that the design did when it appeared in other media, such as the two-dimensional drawings submitted to the Copyright Office. In Thomas's view, this conceptual separation would not necessarily recreate the useful dress because the design's elements like the chevrons could appear on items in different contexts,&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop7-8&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and they did not conjure uniform even when that context was other items of clothing.&lt;ref name=slipop10/&gt; This analysis moved the consideration away from whether the item left after separation was useful, to solely whether or not the design itself was useful. A feature incapable of being separated was a utilitarian feature anyway, Thomas said.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop7-8/&gt;

Addressing concerns that this would grant control over more than the design, Thomas pointed out that the separated aesthetic element could not, itself, be a useful article. Someone also couldn't copyright a design and then exert control over its physical representation. A drawing a or small model of a car, copyrighted, could not restrict production of the functional automobile with the same body by a competitor. The car drawing would not suppress a rival car manufacturer in the automobile market, so Varsity's uniform drawing would not suppress Star Athletica in the uniform market because their uniforms could have the same cut.&lt;ref name=slipop7-8/&gt;

The final section of the opinion discussed objections to the decision raised by the parties in their briefs. There were no requirements that there be an equivalent useful article remaining after the design element was conceptually removed or that the removed element be "solely artistic." Thomas said discussions of the blank dress were unnecessary because the statute did not require the remaining work to be useful or "similarly useful," as the government had put it, because all that mattered was if the separated element was a pictorial, graphical, or sculptural work. Thomas said that adopting this requirement would have overruled ''Mazer'' because the reason the statue in that case was considered "applied art" was because the 1909 Act had removed an earlier distinction between aesthetic and useful works of art. That distinction was not reinstated by the 1976 Act, so there was to be no distinguishing between "conceptual" and "physical" separability.&lt;ref name=slipop12-15&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas further rejected Star Athletica's additional "objective" considerations from preexisting tests, namely that the work be identified as artistic contributions from a designer independent of the utilitarian purpose, and that the work still be marketable without the utilitarian function of the design.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop15-17&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; These were not within the statute, so Thomas dismissed them, saying that all that mattered was consumer perception and not the design's intent. Finally, regarding the idea that [[Legislative history#United States|Congress's noted reluctance]] to apply copyrightability to useful articles in general, Thomas said that congressional inaction was usually not a significant argument with courts. Thomas found a lot of the discussion moot because copyright could not restrict the cut of the design and copyright coverage was not mutually exclusive from design patenting.&lt;ref name=slipop15-17/&gt;

===Concurrence===
[[File:Attachment to 2017 opinion of Justice Ginsburg in Star Athletica v Varsity Brands.png|thumb|One page of the 11-page appendix to Justice Ginsburg's opinion, which highlighted that the designs were registered with the U.S. Copyright Office as "2-dimensional artwork"]]
Justice Ginsburg wrote an opinion concurring in judgement&amp;mdash;the cheerleading uniform designs were separable&amp;mdash;without joining in the majority's reasoning. The copyrights were not registered for the useful articles of clothing, emphasized Ginsburg. The registrations were for pictoral and graphical works that were then ''reproduced on'' the clothing.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica, LLC v. Varsity Brands, Inc.'', No. 15-866, 580 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 1 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment)&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Copyright Act of 1976 provided copyright claimants "the right to reproduce the work in or on any kind of article, whether useful or otherwise,"&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|17|113|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; the claimant of a pictorial, graphical, or sculptural work's copyright could restrict others from reproducing the work's elements on their separate useful articles. According to her, there was no need for the court to address the separability analysis issue at all.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).&lt;/ref&gt; To prove her point, Justice Ginsburg attached to her decision several pages of applications submitted by Varsity Brands to the Copyright Office, pointing to their claimed type of work being "2-dimensional artwork" or "fabric design (artwork)."&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 4-14 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the concurrence's notes, Ginsburg mentioned that she also did not take a stand on whether or not Varsity's designs were actually original enough to be copyrightable. Nonetheless, she did refer to a previous case called ''[[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'' and quoted its conclusion that "the requisite level of creativity [for copyrightability] is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice."&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent===
Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Kennedy, dissented. While he agreed with much of the majority's reasoning, he disagreed with the framing and application of the majority's test and concluded the design was not separable from the uniform's useful article.&lt;ref name="breyer1"&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 1 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer also criticized what he considered vagueness in the majority's test. He thought that, under it, "virtually any industrial design" could be considered separable as soon as it was thought of in terms of art, whether via giving it a picture frame or [[Found art|merely calling the object art]] like a [[Marcel Duchamp]] [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|series]].&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 6-7 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer's approach to the problem was to interpret what "identified separately" meant in the context of the statute. His reading was that, to be separable, the design features needed to be either physically separable from the article while leaving the utilitarian object functional or else the design features needed to be conceivably separable without conjuring a picture of the utilitarian object in someone's mind. He returned to ''Mazer v. Stein'' and applied his reasoning to two lamps, one with a [[Siamese cat]] statuette for a pole and one with an brass rod pole and a cat statuette attached elsewhere on its base. When it was elsewhere on the base, it could be physically separable and was therefore copyrightable as a figurine. When the cat was the pole, it couldn't be physically separated, but it could be conceptually separated from the context of the lamp without conjuring the idea of a lamp and was therefore copyrightable as a figurine.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2-4 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; Applying his version of the test to the cheerleader uniforms, he found that the design was not physically separable. Further, picturing the design separately would reveal a cheerleader uniform "coextensive with that design and cut", so the design and useful article were not conceptually separable either.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breyer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breyer11"&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 11 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt;

He then considered [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)#Pair of shoes|shoes painted by]] [[Vincent van Gogh]] and turned to the examples of Congress's intended targets of copyright in the ''amicus curiae'' brief filed by the Intellectual Property Professors. Breyer found that copyrighting those embellishments was not the same as copyrighting an entire cheerleading uniform design because those examples were conceptually separable while the uniform design was not. He reiterated that van Gogh could certainly have received a copyright to prevent people from reproducing his painting, but the request in ''Star Athletica'' was an injunction against reproducing uniforms and Breyer felt this decision would be equivalent to giving van Gogh a design copyright that could prevent others from producing those shoes.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 4-6 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; He directly accused Varsity Brands of trying to acquire copyrights in order to "prevent its competitors from making useful three-dimensional cheerleader uniforms by submitting plainly unoriginal chevrons and stripes as cut and arranged on a useful article."&lt;ref name="breyer11"/&gt;

The majority opinion believed Breyer's concerns were not a bar to a design's copyrightability, and neither was Star Athletica's similar idea that the design couldn't be copyrighted because the designs would have the same outline as the useful article. They analogized the uniform's design to a mural on a curved dome, saying that the contour of the dome would not prevent the mural from being copyrightable. They also thought that Breyer's traditional view that a preexisting two-dimensional artwork applied to a portion of the clothing could be copyrighted was contradictory because then the statute would provide copyright restriction to designs that covered part of the clothing surface, but not designs that covered all of it.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 11&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsburg's concurrence agreed on the second point in its notes, and referred to the fact that portions of Varsity's claimed uniform designs do appear on other merchandise like t-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2-3 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment)&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the dissenting justice studied the state of the fashion industry at the time of the decision. Recent Congresses had rejected 70 bills to extend copyright to cover designs on useful articles, which he interpreted as [[Legislative intent|an unwillingness of lawmakers]] to enact the change. He cited the metrics provided by the Varsity ''amici'' Council of Fashion Designers of America to show that the fashion industry was doing very well for itself without copyright then quoted warnings from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] against wantonly expanding copyright monopolies. Seeing no pressing need to extend the restriction, he did not want to overstep the bounds of the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]'s [[Copyright Clause]], especially when the available design patents afforded fifteen years of restriction and copyright could offer more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 7-9 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
===Immediate reactions===
Varsity Brands's leadership and supporters were pleased by the decision. Varsity founder Jeff Webb said that it was a win for "the basic idea that designers everywhere can create excellent work and make investments in their future without fear of having it stolen or copied." [[Susan Scafidi]], founder of the Fashion Law Institute, had been involved in with the case from the district court level and lamented that it had to go all the way to the Supreme Court. Still, she praised Thomas's decision as a maintenance of the status quo based on the copyrightability of fabric patterns. Although it was important to her because she believed fashion designers deserved to restrict their valuable designs with copyright, she didn't think it would change things for designers because it was based on the language of the preexisting statute.&lt;ref name="OneYearLater"&gt;{{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP41JX8xU2o |title=Star Athletica: One Year Later |date=2018-03-23 |last=The Federalist Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/939637/the-supreme-court-ruled-that-varsity-brands-cheerleading-uniform-designs-are-protected-by-copyright-law/ |title=The Supreme Court says the iconic American cheerleading uniform design is protected by copyright law |last=Mejia |first=Zameena |website=Quartz |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puma based the copyright infringement portion of their case on the nine-day-old precedent and said that various Forever 21 shoes included copyrighted elements of similar Puma products. Forever 21, a supplier of knock-offs, had been sued for copyright infringement in the past, but this was among the first times that a company used the argument that, in the case of Puma's [[Rihanna|Fenty]] Fur Slides, their "wide plush fur strap extending to the base of the sandal" was capable of being represented in another tangible medium, and therefore covered by copyright as separable from the shoe itself. Puma claimed "a casually knotted satin bow with pointed endings atop a satin-lined side strap that extends to the base of the sandal" was a copyrighted element on their Bow Slides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/puma-files-design-patent-copyright-trade-dress-suit-against-forever-21-over-rihanna-footwear |title=Puma Files Patent, Copyright, Trade Dress Suit Against Forever 21 Over Rihanna Shoes |website=The Fashion Law |language=en-US |access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.knobbe.com/news/2017/04/puma-treads-new-territory-hitting-forever-21-copyright-allegations-after-supreme-court |title=Puma Treads New Territory Hitting Forever 21 with Copyright Allegations after the Supreme Court’s ''Star Athletica'' Decision |last=Morrow |first=Loni |last2=Hyman |first2=Jonathan |date=2017-04-04 |website=Knobbe Martens Intellectual Property Law |language=en |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forever 21 responded with a detailed motion to dismiss that claimed the Fenti line resembled [[prior art]], among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/forever-21-claims-fenty-puma-creeper-design-isnt-new-dates-back-decades |title=Forever 21 Claims Fenty Puma Creeper Design Isn't New, "Dates Back Decades" |website=The Fashion Law |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companies settled in November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/forever-21-puma-settle-lawsuit-over-copied-fenty-footwear |title=Forever 21, Puma Settle Lawsuit Over Copied Fenty Footwear |website=The Fashion Law |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case resolution===
The case was passed back to the district court in Tennessee and, in August 2017, the case was settled out of court in favor of Varsity Brands, over Star Athletica's objection, by Star Athletica's insurance company. Star Athletica wanted to press a counter-claim following the Supreme Court's ruling that designs on the uniforms ''could'' be copyrightable with an argument that the ''particular'' Varsity designs in the case ''should not'' be copyrightable due to their simplicity. The settlement precluded that argument and closed the case with prejudice, so the seven years of litigation concluded firmly.&lt;ref name="AnUnsatisfyingEnd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashionindustrylaw.com/2017/09/25/star-athletica-an-unsatisfying-end/ |title=Star Athletica: An Unsatisfying End |last=Freeman |first=Helene M. |date=2017-09-25 |website=The Fashion Industry Law Blog |publisher=Phillips Nizer, LLP. |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Varsity Brands, Inc. v.

===Legal analyses===
[[Columbia Law School]] professor Ronald Mann provided an analysis of the opinion for [[SCOTUSblog]], remarking:

{{quote|What the court does not state expressly in that part of its opinion is that the standard for determining whether a graphic work (for example) is copyrightable is minimal. ... So once the court has said that any design can gain copyright protection if it would be protectable if placed first on a piece of paper, it really has ensured that all but the subtlest graphic designs will be able to gain copyright protection. ... To put [the Court's application of its test to the uniforms (quoted in the [[#Majority opinion|"majority opinion" section]] above)] more bluntly, once we determine that the designs 'hav[e] … graphic … qualities … [and could be] applied … on a painter’s canvas,' the test for copyrightability is met. ... I am sure that my colleagues who study intellectual property will write at length for years to come about the doctrinal nuances of the court’s discussion of the separability requirement, which seems to me a marked shift from most of the prior treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/03/opinion-analysis-court-uses-cheerleader-uniform-case-validate-broad-copyright-industrial-designs/ |title=Opinion analysis: Court uses cheerleader uniform case to validate broad copyright in industrial designs |last=Mann |first=Ronald |date=2017-03-22 |website=SCOTUSblog |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Fremont Solstice Parade 2013 108 (9234993871).jpg|thumb|right|"Am I copyrightable?"]]

The ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' felt ''Star Athletica'' was an important step towards removing subjectivity from the tests in this area of the law, such as by removing the framing problem that changed the outcome of the analysis based on how the usefulness of the article was defined, evidenced by Judge McKeague. However, the ''Review'' worried that the decision may not fully resolve conflicting lower court rulings because the conflicting majority and dissent were both based on close readings of the statute without enough clearly differentiating examples in the majority to completely discredit the alternative view. A potential contradiction in Thomas's majority opinion may not help on that front that pecerption; specifically, the assertion that surface designs are "inherently separable" from useful articles without being useful articles themselves and the assertion that other clothing bearing the design do not conjure the original useful article. The ''Review'' speculated that "these [[dicta]] imply that the independently existing work can have the shape and look of the article, evoke the same concepts, and even perform the same function and still be separable," and therefore be copyrightable.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt; Indeed, a 2018 disctrict court case, ''Silvertop Assocs., Inc. v. Kangaroo Mfg., Inc.'', ruled that a banana costume's physical features were separable from the costume and copyrightable because they could be painted on a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Silvertop Assocs., Inc. v. Kangaroo Mfg., Inc. |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=D.N.J. |date=2018-30-18 |url=https://casetext.com/case/silvertop-assocs-inc-v-kangaroo-mfg-inc |accessdate=2018-08-02 |quote=These features include: a) the overall length of the costume, b) the overall shape of the design in terms of curvature, c) the length of the shape both above and below the torso of the wearer, d) the shape, size, and jet black color of both ends, e) the location of the head and arm cutouts which dictate how the costume drapes on and protrudes from a wearer (as opposed to the mere existence of the cutout holes), f) the soft, smooth, almost shiny look and feel of the chosen synthetic fabric, g) the parallel lines which mimic the ridges on a banana in three-dimensional form, and h) the bright shade of a golden yellow and uniform color that appears distinct from the more muted and inconsistent tones of a natural banana. The Court finds that, if these features were separated from the costume itself and applied on a painter's canvas, it would qualify as a two-dimensional work of art in a way that would not replicate the costume itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professors Jeanne C. Fromer and Mark P. McKenna were critical of the ambiguity of the decision because the three major stages of litigation resulted in three different majority decisions on three different grounds, with more divergent opinions among the dissents and concurrence. Because the courts allowed Varsity to define extremely narrow copyright restrictions in the registration then sue others like Star Athletica with general descriptions in court filings, they were concerned that this disconnect in requirements would lead to more controversial lawsuits, even outside the realm of useful articles. After all, a model car could be copyrighted as a sculpture, a drawing of that model could be copyrighted, and the claimant could use features of either equally to file copyright claims. Exactly what features of either were actually restricted was left up to debate because the registration's description could diverge almost entirely from the lawsuit's filing, so Fromer and McKenna contended it would be impossible to know what the copyright holder considered restricted before they described it in a lawsuit, let alone before the second party begins the desired copying. Moreover, in the absence of that description, they said it was impossible to perform a separability analysis and determine if the feature was even copyrightable at all before active litigation.&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"/&gt;

Sara Benson, a lawyer who agreed with the decision, has wondered if the court's explicit rejection of a copyrightability test that valued artistic effort on the designer's part may harm perception of designers' value to the clients they work for. She mentioned that that test had allowed designers to leverage their creativity for respect and credibility during corporate design processes, and that its removal may have removed some of their negotiating power.&lt;ref name="Benson2018"/&gt;

David Kluft of [[Foley Hoag]] has noted that this new ability to copyright design elements comes paired with criminal penalties if it comes to light that the elements have any utility. If the entity applying for copyright on the design knew about that utility, that would be considered false representation of a material fact in the copyright registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2018/04/star-athletica-and-the-expansion-of-useful-article-protection-copyright-office-permits-registration-of-automotive-floor-liner/ |title=Star Athletica and the Expansion of Useful Article Protection: Copyright Office Permits Registration of Automotive Floor Liner |last=Kluft |first=David |publisher=Foley Hoag, LLP |date=2018-04-24 |website=Trademark And Copyright Law |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Red Balloon''''' ({{lang-fr|Le ballon rouge}}) is a 1956 French [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[comedy-drama]] [[featurette]] written, produced, and directed by [[Albert Lamorisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0048980|title=The Red Balloon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The thirty-five-minute&lt;ref name=bbfc/&gt; short, which follows the adventures of a young boy who one day finds a sentient, mute, red balloon, was filmed in the [[Ménilmontant]] neighbourhood of [[Paris]].

Lamorisse used his children as actors in the film. His son, Pascal, plays himself in the main role, and his daughter, Sabine, portrays a little girl.

The film won numerous awards, including an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Lamorisse for writing the [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]] in 1956 and the [[Short Film Palme d'Or|Palme d'Or for short films]] at the [[1956 Cannes Film Festival]]. It also became popular with children and educators. It is the only short film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] and to receive a nomination for anything besides [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Live Action Short Film]].

==Plot==
The film follows Pascal (Pascal Lamorisse), a young boy who, on his way to school one morning, discovers a large helium-filled red balloon. As he plays with it, he realizes it has a mind and will of its own. It begins to follow him wherever he goes, never straying far from him, and at times floating outside his bedroom window, as his mother will not allow it in their apartment.

The balloon follows Pascal through the streets of Paris, and they draw a lot of attention and envy from other children as they wander the streets. At one point the balloon enters his classroom, causing an uproar from his classmates. The noise alerts the principal, who locks Pascal up in his office. Later, after being set free, Pascal and the balloon encounter a little girl (Sabine Lamorisse) with a blue balloon that also seems to have a mind of its own, just like the red one.
One Sunday, the balloon is told to stay home while Pascal and his mother go to church. However, it follows them through the open window and into the church, and they are led out by a scolding [[beadle]].

In their wanderings around the neighborhood, Pascal and the balloon encounter a gang of older boys, who are envious of the balloon and attempt to steal it while Pascal is inside a bakery; however, he manages to retrieve it. Following a chase through narrow alleyways, the boys finally catch the balloon, throw stones at it, and bring it down with sling shots before one of the boys finish it off by stomping on it.

The film ends as all the other balloons in Paris come to Pascal's aid and take him on a [[cluster balloon]] ride over the city.

==Themes==
As the film was filmed in [[Paris]] after World War II, its mise-en-scene is quite dark and grey and therefore gives a depressing quality to the setting and mood.  In contrast, the balloon's bright colour acts as a symbol of hope and light within the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koresky|first1=Michael|title=The Red Balloon|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/655-the-red-balloon|website=The Criterion Collection|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cluster balloon ride in the closing scene could also be said to represent a religious or spiritual analogy. For example, when the balloon is destroyed, its "spirit" lives on as it is transferred to all the other balloons in the city, which is said to be a metaphor for Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alisashortfilm.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/the-red-balloon-1956/|title=The Red Balloon (1956)|date=2011-02-28|work=Notes on Short Film|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Themes of self-realisation and loneliness are also present in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/778-the-red-balloon-written-on-the-wind|title=The Red Balloon: Written on the Wind|website=The Criterion Collection|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The theme of innocence is persistent and is one of the main focuses of the film. Through a child’s gaze, a cynical world is transformed into an almost magical one, highlighting the power of the innocence and imagination of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/22/AR2007112201315.html|title='Red Balloon' and 'White Mane': Childhood Colored by Adult Cynicism|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2007-11-23|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, authors such as Myles P. Breen have identified the film as having thematic/stylistic qualities that are reflective of the poetic medium. This perspective is rationalised by Breen through quoting film theorist Christian Metz, who states, “in a poem there is no story line, and nothing intrudes between the author and the reader”. The film, therefore, is categorised by Breen as being a filmic poem, partially due to its loose, non-narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BREEN|first=MYLES P.|date=1978|title=The Rhetoric of the Short Film|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20687433|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|volume=30|issue=3|pages=3–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The film serves as a color record of the [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] area of Paris, which had fallen into decay by the 1960s, prompting the Parisian government to demolish it as a slum-clearance effort. Part of the site was built up with housing projects; the remainder was left as wasteland for 20 years. Some of what is seen in the film no longer exists: one of the bakeries, the famous shaped staircase situated just beyond the equally famous café "Au Repos de la Montagne", the steep steps of the passage Julien Lacroix where Pascal finds the balloon, and the empty lot where all the battles take place. Instead stands the [[Parc de Belleville]]. Only the church still stands.

Albert Lamorrise was a former auditor at the [[Institut des hautes études cinématographiques]] (IDHEC), and the crew that he used for the making of the film was entirely composed of IDHEC graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TESSONNEAU|first=RÉMY|last2=Ferguson|first2=Charles|date=1957|title=The French Institute Of Cinema (IDHEC)|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20686478|journal=Journal of the University Film Producers Association|volume=10|issue=1|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film premiered and opened nationwide in France on 19 October 1956; it was released in the United Kingdom on 23 December 1956 (as the supporting film to the 1956 Royal Performance Film ''[[The Battle of the River Plate (film)|The Battle of the River Plate]]'', which ensured it a [[Wide release|wide distribution]]) and in the United States on 11 March 1957.

It has been featured in many festivals over the years, including the Wisconsin International Children's Film Festival; the Los Angeles Outfest Gay and Lesbian Film Festival; the [[Wisconsin Film Festival]]; and others.

The film, in its American [[television]] premiere, was introduced by then-actor [[Ronald Reagan]] as an episode of the [[CBS]] [[anthology series]] ''[[General Electric Theater]]'' on 2 April 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmovie title|id=40656|title=The Red Balloon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, the film was popular in elementary classrooms throughout the United States and Canada. A four-minute clip is on the rotating list of programming on [[Classic Arts Showcase]].

===Reception===
Since its first release in 1956, the film has generally received overwhelmingly favorable reviews from critics. The film critic for ''[[the New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]], hailed the simple tale and praised director Lamorisse, writing that "Yet with the sensitive cooperation of his own beguiling son and with the gray-blue atmosphere of an old Paris quarter as the background for the shiny balloon, he has got here a tender, humorous drama of the ingenuousness of a child and, indeed, a poignant symbolization of dreams and the cruelty of those who puncture them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07E7DC1639E33BBC4A52DFB566838C649EDE|title=Screen: Documentary and Fantasy; 'Lost Continent,' 'Red Balloon' on Bill|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the film was re-released in the United States in late 2006 by [[Janus Films]], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine film critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] praised its direction and simple story line that reminded him of his youth, and wrote, "More than any other children's film, ''The Red Balloon'' turns me into a kid again whenever I see it...[to] see ''The Red Balloon'' is to laugh, and cry, at the impossible joy of being a child again."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20162166,00.html|title=The Red Balloon|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic Brian Gibson wrote, "So far, this seems a post-Occupation France happy to forget the blood and death of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] war a decade earlier. But soon people’s occasional, playful efforts to grab the floating, carefree balloon become grasping and destructive. In a gorgeous sequence, light streaming down alleys as children's shoes clack and clatter on the cobblestones, the balloon bouncing between the walls, Pascal is hunted down for his floating pet. Its ballooning sense of hope and freedom is deflated by a fierce, squabbling mass. Then, fortunately, it floats off, with the breeze of magic-realism, into a feeling of escape and peace, ''The Red Balloon'' taking hold of Pascal, lifting him out of this rigid, petty, earthbound life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/20130205160335/http://www.vueweekly.com/article.php?id=7536|title=What childhood films are these? :: Film :: VUE Weekly|date=2013-02-05|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in ''[[The Washington Post]],'' critic Philip Kennicott had a cynical view: "[The film takes] place in a world of lies. Innocent lies? Not necessarily. ''The Red Balloon'' may be the most seamless fusion of [[capitalism]] and [[Christianity]] ever put on film. A young boy invests in a red balloon the love of which places him on the outside of society. The balloon is hunted down and killed on a barren hilltop–-think [[Calvary]]–-by a mob of cruel boys. The ending, a bizarre emotional sucker punch, is straight out of the [[New Testament]]. Thus is investment rewarded-–with Christian [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] or, at least, an old-fashioned [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]. This might be sweet. Or it might be a very cynical reduction of the primary impulse to religious faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/22/AR2007112201315.html|title='Red Balloon' and 'White Mane': Childhood Colored by Adult Cynicism|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2007-11-23|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 95% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on twenty reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/red_balloon/ ''The Red Balloon''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Accessed July 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Ribbon International''' is a United Nations Non-Governmental Organization that created a large decorated cloth promoting [[nuclear disarmament]] and care and protection of the earth. In an event held on August 4, 1985, panels were connected in an {{convert|18|mi|km}} long strip stretching from [[the Pentagon]] into Washington D.C. The event was covered in the film ''The Ribbon Starts Here'' by [[Nigel Noble]] (1988). Individual sections of the Ribbon are exhibited internationally. In 1991, The Ribbon International became a United Nations Non Governmental Organization.&lt;ref name="The Ribbon International"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Ribbon International | work = UN NGO Directory | publisher = United Nations

Ribbons were used at peace demonstrations at the [[Nevada Nuclear Test Site]], and the Horse Creek Missile Silo near [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and the [[Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament]] in 1986.{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=264}}

== Planning ==
[[File:Justines Ribbon.jpg|thumb|Merritt's first Ribbon panel is embroidered with the names of people she loved.]]

The Ribbon International was created in 1982 as a [[Anti-nuclear protests|protest against nuclear war]] by Justine Merritt (1924–2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Merritt | first = Justine | title = Sowing Seeds | url = http://justinemerritt.net/ | accessdate = 2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a trip to the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] in [[Hiroshima]], Japan, in 1975, Merritt conceived the idea of wrapping [[the Pentagon]] with a mile of ribbon to recall (in Merritt's words) "that we love the earth and its people," which is analogous with tying a string around one's finger to remember something.&lt;ref name="Grogan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grogan | first = David | title = A Pentagon Ribbon for Peace | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20091229,00.html | journal = People Magazine | date = July 8, 1985 | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=80}} The event took place on August 4, 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingson | first = Jennifer A. | title = Ring Around the Pentagon: A Nuclear Frieze | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1985/2/8/ring-around-the-pentagon-a-nuclear/ | journal = The Harvard Crimson | date = February 8, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pentagon Ceremony"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pentagon Ceremony Aug. 4 Peace Ribbons in Oklahoma Called In | url = http://newsok.com/pentagon-ceremony-aug.-4-peace-ribbons-in-oklahoma-called-in/article/2115461 | journal = The Oklahoman: NewsOK| date = July 20, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kampel | first = Stewart | title = A 'Ribbon' For Peace Unfurled On L.I. | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/03/nyregion/a-ribbon-for-peace-unfurled-on-li.html | journal = New York Times | date = March 3, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 40th anniversary of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=1}}

[[File:Justine Merritt.jpg|thumb|left|Justine Merritt founded the project.]]

The Ribbon was made in the three years leading up to the Pentagon event from hundreds of panels created by local groups co-ordinated nationally by Mary Frances Jaster of Denver with state co-ordinators. Each {{convert|36|by|18|in|cm}} panel used embroidery, quilting, painting and other techniques.  The makers were invited to convey their thoughts and emotions in the panels, with their story on the back.

Friends, relatives, places of worship, and other organizations helped spread Merritt's idea throughout the United States and around the world. Local newsletters and arts and crafts magazines such as ''Fibre Art'', ''Handwoven'', and ''Quilter's Newsletter Magazine'' helped publicize the project.&lt;ref name= "Wilcox"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilcox | first = Don | title = Peace Ribbon Wraps Washington In Largest Collaborative Craft Event In American History | journal = The Craft Report | date = October 1985 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fanning | first = Robbie | title = Fibre Artist Hopes to Wrap Pentagon in Long Embroidered Ribbon That Transforms Ugly Fear Into Concrete Beauty | journal = The Craft Report | date = December 1983 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sew To Speak Is Theme For Ribbon For Peace | journal = Quilters Newsletter Magazine | date = November–December 1984 | page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Levin| first=Adam | title= Works From the Heart: Home Sewers Unite To Tie Up the Pentagon | journal=Sews News| volume=June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fanning | first = Robbie | title = After the Ribbon | journal = Threads Magazine | date = December 1985 – January 1986 | pages = 12, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories leading up to the Pentagon event appeared in over 2,500 publications, including local newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kernan | first = Michael | title = Ribbon Around The Pentagon | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138227300.html | journal = Washington Post | date= September 12, 1984 |page = B1 | accessdate=2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boscov | first = Rema | title= Three Years of Peace Work | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138625864.html | journal = Washington Post | date = July 16, 1985 | page = C7 | accessdate=2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hyer | first = Marjorie | title = Prayers for Peace Interwoven | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138619411.html | date = July 27, 1985 | page = G10| accessdate = 2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Where to See Ribbon Segments | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138595982.html | journal = Washington Post | date = July 27, 1985 | page = G10 | accessdate = 2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weil | first = Martin | title= Police Say 15-Mile Peace Ribbon Won't Tie Up D.C.

[[File:California Banner on Mall.jpg|thumb|Californians contributed over 3,000 panels.]]
Panels were received from contributors in every state in the United States. Every state and many towns and organizations held Ribbon joining events. Panels were received from all over the world, including Russia, England, Germany, New Zealand, Italy, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="The Ribbon Starts Here"&gt;{{cite AV media | title = The Ribbon Starts Here |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FiK79mvYk| accessdate = 2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of women with [[Church Women United]] led a grassroots effort around the country, making panels and assisting with preparations in Washington. Their newsletter, which was sent to a half a million members of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church in America]], the [[Salvation Army]], the [[Quakers]], and 29 other [[Christian denominations]], provided information on how to construct the panels. More than 3,000 Ribbon panels were contributed by this group.&lt;ref name="Pentagon Ceremony"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janzen"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Janzen | first = Victoria | title = Kansans and The Peace Ribbon Around the Pentagon in the 1980s | url = http://archive.bethelks.edu/ml/issue/vol-64/article/kansans-and-the-peace-ribbon-around-the-pentagon-i/ | journal = Mennonite Life | date = Summer 2010 | volume = 64 | accessdate = 2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartman"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biography of Annabel Hartman | url = http://www.indianahistory.org/our-collections/collection-guides/annabel-hartman-papers-1981-1990.pdf| publisher = Indiana Historical Society | date = March 31, 2003 | accessdate = 2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California delegation contributed over 3,000 panels for the Ribbon event. In 1984, they created a display of panels that surrounded [[Lake Merritt]] in [[Oakland]].{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=93}} The California group also sent panels to Hiroshima for a Ribbon event that was going to surround the at the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]] on the same day as the Pentagon event.&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Steele | first = R.

Marie Dennis Grosso, Joan Urbanczyk, and Margaret Schellenberg of the Center for a New Creation (a peace group in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia) coordinated the Washington event. The center concentrated on peacemaking, poverty and economic justice, human rights, and women's issues.{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=103}} [[Betty Bumpers]], an advocate for world peace and wife of former U.S. Senator and Governor of Arkansas [[Dale Bumpers]], also worked on preparations for the Washington event with her group Peace Links, a national nonpartisan organization of women who oppose the nuclear arms buildup.{&lt;ref name="Rowley"&gt;{{cite web | last = Rowley | first = James | title = Group Plans To Stretch 'Peace Ribbon' From Pentagon To Capitol Hill | url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1985/Group-Plans-To-Stretch-Peace-Ribbon-From-Pentagon-To-Capitol-Hill/id-4ba9b8b731d43f111f107bcc56e9a6a8 | agency = Associated Press | date = August 2, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=149}} Organizers planned a {{convert|10|to|15|mi|km|adj=on}} route through Washington D.C., and met with various police authorities and the [[National Park Service]] to obtain the required permits. Security was of utmost importance; the course from Virginia into Washington travelled past some of the most important buildings and monuments in the country. Forty-nine churches and one senior's center in the Washington area hosted individual state delegations and participants. The churches held a reception for attendees and provided bag lunches, lodging, and transportation. Host churches also displayed panels.{{sfn|Pershing|1996|pp=103–104}}&lt;ref name="Wilcox"/&gt;

== Events in Washington ==
[[File:Washing National Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Each of the 2,500 pews in the cathedral was covered with a panel.]]
[[File:The Ribbon Starts Here.jpg|thumb|Assembly of the Ribbon gets underway at the [[United States Capitol]], Washington, D.C.]]
The interfaith service for peace, held on August 3 at the [[Washington National Cathedral]], was attended by 5,000 people. Cathedral staff reported that it was the second-largest crowd ever hosted in the building.{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=150}} Over 4,000 panels were on display during the service. Each pew was decorated, and additional Ribbons were draped and tied in various locations around the building. Twenty bagpipers in Highland dress led a procession of 200 people carrying Ribbons into the cathedral. The service also included dancing, meditation, and a performance by the [[Howard University]] Gospel Choir.&lt;ref name="Steele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ribbon News Letter"&gt;{{cite journal | title= 'Ribbon' Documentary| journal = The Ribbon Newsletter | volume = October 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were in attendance both at the church service and during The Ribbon event the next day.

When all 27,000 individual panels were joined together on August 4, it created a ribbon {{convert|18|mi}} long.&lt;ref name="Weil" /&gt; Don Wilcox of ''The Craft Report'' described it as "the largest collaborative craft event in American history".&lt;ref name="Wilcox"/&gt; The Ribbon wrapped around the Pentagon building, through the Pentagon parking lot, down the foot paths alongside the [[Jefferson Davis Highway]] and [[Washington Boulevard (Arlington)|Washington Boulevard]], crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Washington D.C. at the [[Arlington Memorial Bridge]], and travelled into the [[National Mall]] area. The Ribbon then went past the [[Lincoln Memorial]], along the south side of the [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool]], continuing east along the National Mall, and around the U.S.[[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]]. It then turned west along the north side of the National Mall, went around the Ellipse by the White House, passed the Lincoln Memorial, crossed the Potomac River again and returned to the Pentagon. When the chain of panels was completed, hundreds of balloons were released near the Lincoln Memorial. The entire route was lined with people, and crowds gathered at the three designated speaking areas (the Pentagon, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Capitol). Singers, including [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Tom Chapin]], rotated between the three stage areas, performing anti-war songs.&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sanders | first = Steve | title = 'Peace Ribbon' Tied Around The Capitol | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-08-05/news/8502200974_1_chicago-peace-museum-justine-merritt-lincoln-memorial | journal = Chicago Tribune | date = August 5, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=154}} Newspapers estimated a total attendance of 30,000 to 100,000 people.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Video filming was done by numerous individuals, and professional television video personnel from New York and Washington, D.C., who donated their time and equipment to create a documentary about the event. The documentary film ''The Ribbon Starts Here'',&lt;ref name="The Ribbon Starts Here"/&gt; was produced by Academy Award-winning film maker [[Nigel Noble]], and directed by Nigel Noble and Hilary Raff Lindsay; Nobel Enterprises. The video was released in 1988.&lt;ref name="Wilcox"/&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=292}}

== Subsequent events ==
After August 4, state coordinators returned home with their Ribbon panels, which were then displayed in libraries, schools, and museums, and used in parades and events.&lt;ref name="Weil"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weil | first = Dorothy | title = Peace Packages Around The Pentagon | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wh8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=picture+#v=onepage&amp;q=picture&amp;f=false | journal = Cincinnati Magazine | date = November 1986 | pages = 155–157 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p={{page needed|date=June 2014}} }} Historical societies and universities now house historical information about the Ribbon and archival collections of panels.&lt;ref name="Hartman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Peace Ribbon Project Northwest Ohio | url = http://www2.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/cac/ms/page45281.html |publisher = Center for Archival Collections, Bowling Green State University | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Ribbons and panels were selected as gallery pieces, and are on display in [[The Peace Museum]] in Chicago.

The Ribbon evolved into The Ribbon International in the late 1980s, and became a United Nations Non Governmental Organization in 1991.&lt;ref name="The Ribbon International"/&gt; Ribbon events can be held for special designated days such as the [[International Day of Peace]] (September 21), [[Earth Day]] (April 21), special prayer days or other events. Any individual or group can create a panel for a Ribbon, start a Ribbon in their community, or give a panel as a gift to someone who is engaged in promoting peace, environmental causes, or disarmament.&lt;ref name="Peppers 14"/&gt;

New panels continue to be created for display at various environmental and peace events. Ribbons have been given to the [[New York City Council]], Russian President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], and [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Palmer | first = Susan | title = Peace Winds Like a Ribbon |url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/registerguard/doc/377698479.html | journal = Eugene Register-Guard | date = May 14, 2005 |page = D1 | accessdate = 2014-02-25 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panels from the Ribbon were displayed at the [[United Nations Decade for Women]] international conference in [[Nairobi]] in 1985, and others were used by members of Women for a Meaningful Summit at their demonstration at the [[Geneva Summit (1985)]]. Ribbons were used at peace demonstrations at the [[Nevada Nuclear Test Site]], and the Horse Creek Missile Silo near [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and the [[Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament]] in 1986.{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=264}}

'''Vineta''' (sometimes ''Wineta'') is the name of a mythical city at the southern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The myth evolved around the tradition about the medieval emporium called Jumne, [[Jomsborg]] (with which Vineta is sometimes identified), Julin or similar names by the chronicles.

==Myth==
There are several Vineta myths, all of them having in common an excessive, voluptuous or blasphemous way of life of the Vinetans who were then punished by a flood which took the city to the bottom of the Baltic. In some variants of the myth, the city or parts thereof reappear on certain days or can be seen from a boat, making the warning transported by the myth more tangible for the audience.

==Primary sources==
* About 965, [[Ibrahim ibn Jaqub]] wrote in Arabic letters about this city, the transcription might be ''Weltaba'', which corresponds to modern Polish "Wełtawa" meaning roughly a place among waves.
* 1075/80, [[Adam of Bremen]] wrote about an emporium on an island in the [[Oder]] estuary, east of his Diocese, where Slavs, Barbarians and Greeks were supposed to live and Saxon merchants stayed for trade. [[Harald Bluetooth]] had once found refuge there. The oldest preserved manuscript, from the 11th century, has the spelling ''vimne'' or ''uimne,'' and the second oldest manuscript, from around 1200, has ''uimne'' and ''iumne'' or ''jumne'' (there is no distinction between v and u or i and j in the written Latin of that time). More recent copies of the manuscript primarily use ''Jumne;'' in an early modern print the name is spelled ''Julinum'' and ''Juminem.''&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;Schmidt, Roderich: Das historische Pommern. Personen, Orte, Ereignisse (Veröffentlichungen der Historischen Kommission für Pommern, Reihe V, Forschungen Bd. 41), Köln / Weimar 2007, S. 70-72.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between 1140 and 1159, three vitae of [[Otto of Bamberg]] were written using the name ''Julin'' for the medieval place located at the site of the later town of [[Wolin (town)|Wolin]].&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;
* 1163/1168, [[Helmold of Bosau]] copied almost word for word the respective sentences written by Adam of Bremen. The oldest preserved handwriting of Helmolds chronicle (ca. 1300) has the place spelled ''uineta,'' corrected by the copist to ''iuḿta'' (abbreviation of ''iumenta'' or ''iumneta''). Younger copies use ''Jumneta'' in the text, yet in the header of the respective chapter all copies use ''Vinneta.''&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;
* About 1170, the Nordic [[Knytlinga saga]] reported a siege of ''Jomsborg'' by the Dano-Norwegian king Magnus (1043) and a campaign against that place by the Danish king [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]] (1170).&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;
* About 1190, [[Saxo Grammaticus]] reported the same campaign (1170) and Harald Bluetooth's earlier stay there, but called the place ''Julin[um].''&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;

==Geographical place==
[[File:Vinetakarte.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Postulated locations of Vineta]]
===Vineta Reef off Koserow / Damerow===
Some variants of the myth have Vineta sunken off [[Koserow]] (on the isle of [[Usedom]]). The historian Wilhelm Ferdinand Gadebusch from [[Swinemünde]] (Świnoujście) made this and other observations the basis for his thesis of Vineta's location. According to Gadebusch, Wolin did not have the deep water port that Vineta must have had, and thus discarded the Wolin thesis (see below). [[David Chyträus]] in his 16th century ''Chronicon Saxoniae'' had Vineta "beyond the [[Peene]] river near the village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Damerow (Usedom)|de|3=Damerow (Usedom)|lt=Damerow}}"  which was a [[Folwark|Vorwerk]] of Koserow. For Chyträus, Usedom was the land of the Vinetans, while Julin on the neighboring island of [[Wolin]] was inhabited by Pomoranians. Since no traces of Slavic settlement have been found on northwest Usedom, this thesis is no longer accepted.

===Ruden===
Several maps published between 1633 and 1700 have the sunken "Wineta" east of the island of [[Ruden (island)|Ruden]] northwest of [[Usedom]]. About 1700, {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Walther Marperger|de}} reported it in the same spot. The origin of this thesis is the All Saints flood of 1306 that left over Ruden and other small islands from a much larger landmass that prior to the flood had existed between [[Mönchgut]] and Usedom.

===Wolin===
[[Rudolf Virchow]] said: "Vineta is Wollin!" Based on the primary sources outlined above, {{Interlanguage link multi|Adolf Hofmeister|de}} in 1931/32 formulated the thesis that Vineta, Jumne, Julin, Jomsborg etc. are all different spellings used for the same place on the site of today's town of Wolin.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt; Beginning in the 1930s, and continued after the annexation of Wolin to Poland after World War II, archaeologists unearthed the remains of a large settlement there. Hofmeister's thesis is the only mainstream thesis regarding the location of Vineta in today's historiography.

===Barth===
A thesis formulated by Goldmann und Wermusch placed Vineta near [[Barth, Germany|Barth]], pointing to a possibly different course of the Oder in the Middle Ages and a creative reading of the primary sources outlined above.

==Introduction==
[[File:Japenesecheerleaders.jpg|thumb|Japanese cheerleaders who are part of the [[Waseda University Cheerleading Club]]]]

''Ōendan'' or ''ōenbu'' can be found in [[high school]]s, [[college]]s and [[university|universities]], as well as in non-academic settings such as intercompany sports clubs, professional sports fan clubs, and so on. Many schools hold competitions during their [[sports day]] events, and students often spend weeks perfecting their presentations after being divided up into teams.&lt;ref name="tcheese"/&gt;

Many members of an ''ōendan'' will dress in long ''[[happi]]'' and wear ''[[hachimaki]]'' emblazoned with team logos, inspirational sayings, or the names of their favorite players, something adopted by some fans of Japanese idol groups.&lt;ref name="wolfoo"&gt;{{en icon}}{{ja icon}} {{cite web|url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/okamip/archives/30586364.html|title=ハードコアモーヲタ|date=2005-08-22|accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially with professional [[baseball]] teams, the ''ōendan'' for each team will come up with unique cheers to help the fans become involved. These cheers will often change depending on who the opposing team is.&lt;ref name="yakult"/&gt; On occasion, the fans themselves will come up with a new cheer that is then adopted by other fans and their team's ''ōendan''.&lt;ref name="yakult"/&gt;
