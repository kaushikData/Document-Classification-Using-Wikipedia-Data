The '''Age of Interruption''' refers to a seeming increase in fractured attention due to media tools and virtual [[multitasking]]. The term was popularized by [[Thomas Friedman]] in a 2006 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' opinion editorial.

== Origin of term ==
Friedman deemed the age of "malady of modernity", and characterized it as reflecting [[information overload]] and lack of adequate attention span:

"Continuous partial attention is when you are on the Internet or cellphone or BlackBerry while also watching TV, typing on your computer and answering a question from your kid. That is, you are multitasking your way through the day, continuously devoting only partial attention to each act or person you encounter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Thomas|title=The Age of Interruption|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/opinion/05friedman.html?_r=0|work=New York Times|date=5 July 2006|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology and education ==
Characterized by information overload and multitasking, the age of interruption is a relatively recent but still frequently studied topic in education and technology disciplines. Educators and technology researchers study the phenomenon in relation to its effects on social, cognitive and emotional development. Ellen Rose, a professor of education at [[University of New Brunswick]] in [[Canada]], studies online learning environments, with particular expertise in social effects of technology and [[media ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work of Ellen Rose| url=https://www.unb.ca/fredericton/education/people/ellenrose.html|publisher=University of New Brunswick|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 academic article, she posits that the Age of Interruption is another age in technological formation, following the Information Age. She discusses the Age of Interruption in relation to younger generations ([[digital native]]s) who have an over-abundance of information along with a general attitude of inattention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bassendowski |first=Sandra |title=The Age of Interruption |url=http://cjni.ca/journal/?p=1897 |journal=Canadian Journal of Nursing Infomatics |date=April 2012 |volume=6 |issue=4 |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, other researchers find a more optimistic view of technology's relationship to multitasking. In ''Media as Extensions'', Lin (2009) determined that the hyperlinked structure of information on the web may promote learning and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=Lin|title=Breadth-biased versus focused cognitive control in media multitasking behaviors|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=September 2009|volume=106|issue=37|pages=15521–15522|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15521.full|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=14 December 2012|doi=10.1073/pnas.0908642106|pmid=19805207|pmc=2747151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Akshaya ML emblom1.jpg|thumb|Akshaya Malayalam emblem]]
The '''Akshaya project''', first started in the rural [[Malappuram district]] of [[Kerala]], [[India]], and now spread all around the state, was the first district-wide [[Computer literacy|e-literacy]] project in India and one of the largest known [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) based [[wireless networks]] in the world. In November 2002, the state government of Kerala put into place a project, piloted in Malappuram, with the goal of at least one person in every family to be computer literate in that district. Malappuram is now  what is said to be India's First E-literate District. The mission continues to make Kerala the First E-literate state in India.

In Malappuram district alone, Akshaya has conducted one of the world's largest computer literacy drives, claiming to reach over  600,000 households, representing more than 3.6 million people, in less than 6 months. The project has created a unique brand of state-funded computer access centers, and simultaneously led to a massive wireless infrastructure, providing a wide range of services and making way to many future opportunities.

The project offers lots of services like: [[E-Pay]] (electronic payment of utility bills like electricity, land phone, drinking water, university fees etc.); [[E-Krishi]] (for farmers to provide online agriculture trading and information portal, A to Z Solution); [[E-Vidya]] (advanced IT learning for e-literates and others); E-Ticketing (online train, flight, bus ticket reservations); PMRY online registration; online passport registration; a village kiosk for transparent collectorate program, online communication providers for [[expatriate]] Indians; an online [[medical transcription]] course, with extension programs for all the above-mentioned services.

== Background ==
In the [[1990|nineties of the last century]] [[[United Nations]] ratings for the different regions of the world recorded Kerala as an [[economic miracle]]. In several social parameters the State was at par with the developed West. This unbelievable feat was achieved in spite of a lesser [[per capita income]] and lack of industrial back up. The great economist [[Amarthya Sen]] attributed this achievement to the spread of education to a wider level in Kerala society. A section of educated among Keralites utilised the services of information technology for further [[economic development]]. But the vast majority did not take to this technology for consolidating and furthering the achievements on the social front. A digital divide developed in the State as elsewhere between a minority that could use information technology for development and the majority that could not do so. Planners in the socio-economic front sooner realised that the consolidation of socio economic development in Kerala was possible only by removing the digital divide in the society. The vast majority of the populace have to be equipped with the tools of [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT) to achieve tangible progress. The less privileged sections had to be empowered with ICT. Those at the helms in the three-tier [[panchayat]] system in the State realized the importance of ICT for socio-economic development and they came forward with plan proposals and programmes to bring information technology to common households. Meanwhile, Government constituted the [[State Information Technology Mission]] for achieving transparency and speed in administration so as to make it more responsive to the needs of the people and for grass roots level application of information technology as part of social engineering for development.

== History ==

The IT policy of the Government besides providing for specific initiatives for ICT industry within the State laid emphasis on using ICT in all walks of life to improve living standards. One area identified was government itself. The Task Force on IT implementation in government also recommended to adopt a strategy of administrative reforms-based computerisation simultaneously with highly visible and immediately penetrable citizen-centric projects. The approach to citizen interface was based on the assumption that all direct Government – citizen interactions can be IT-enabled and can be categorised as making payments, getting entitlements, getting providing information and grievance redressal, etc. The implementation of State e-governance projects such as FRIENDS and Information Kerala Mission are examples. In spite of the good social and digital infrastructure ICT and internet penetration in Kerala was comparatively low. Some early attempts for grass root level ICT application did not make much headway.

During this period lots of programmes were initiated worldwide to address digital divide and to familiarise the tools of Information and Communication Technologies to the common man, which were also discussed in Kerala but limited to academic circles. Computer literacy was becoming the buzzword and many local bodies, NGOs and private computer institutes started offering courses and programmes in computer software like Microsoft, DOS Word and Excel. But the IT policy of the government required that the government should intervene to take the benefits of IT to the grass roots level.

Now, some of the local bodies in the three tier Panchayat system came forward with valuable project proposals for computer education at the grass root level. The proposal submitted by Malappuram District Panchayat had many notable features. Even from an international perspective such a massive computer education programme as was suggested in the proposal had not been attempted till then. Many international projects were limited to village level. The details of the project proposal had to be thrashed out for clarity. After a few round of discussions, a small team consisting of six members were formed in KSITM to study various ICT modules for development projects, implementation plans, business model etc. for the initiative.

Discussions about the project led to the important finding that e-literacy was one of the most important components of any such project. A two-pronged approach was needed. While providing computer facilities in the rural areas focus must be given to impart education to the citizens to make use of those facilities. On the basis of further deliberations it was decided to provide a user-friendly content/courseware to the citizens to educate them on the uses of ICT. Creation of functional e-literacy was thus found to be a pre requisite.

As a preparatory measure for the implementation of the project several meetings with the participation of District Panchayat, Block Panchayats, Grama Panchayats, Municipalities and organisation like C-DIT were held. A survey in Malapuram district was held to assess the requirements. 6.5 lakh houses were visited as part of the survey. Spatial mapping was done with the help of Town and Country Planning Department to identify locations to establish the centre of the project.

Establishment of Akshaya-e-Kendra as an ICT access point, one for every 1000 families living in two/three municipal or Panchayat wards was the most important strategic decision. Other details chalked out for implementation were:

Akshaya e-centres were envisaged to have five computers and other infrastructure at a cost of Rs. 3-4 lakhs per centre and they were to be within 2-3 Kilometre distance from every household.
Entrepreneurs from the locality with service orientation were to be selected, on the social entrepreneurship model for running the centres.
At least one person from every family was to be given training for ten days. It was planned that the local bodies should fund this e-literacy initiative Rs. 140 was fixed as tuition fee for 15 hour training programme (Grama Panchayat Rs. 80, Block Panchayat Rs. 20, Dist. Panchayat Rs. 20, beneficiary fee Rs. 20) Strategies were evolved for the involvement of community, civil society organisations, youth and welfare organisations, local bodies, etc. for implementation.
Positioning Social Animators for linking Akshaya centres, citizens, local bodies and government
Strategies for establishing connectivity, creation of locally relevant content etc.
Positioning of District Project Team in Malappuram
The Akshaya pilot project was launched at Trivandrum by Dr. A.P. Abdul Kalam, His Excellency, the President of India on November 18, 2002.

== Achievements ==
Akshaya was conceived as a landmark ICT project by the [[Kerala State Information Technology Mission]] (KSITM) to bridge the digital divide and to bring the benefits of ICT to the entire population of the State. In the initial phase the focus was placed on educating one person in each family to be e-literate. Malappuram, a backward district of Kerala was selected for piloting e-literacy and project was launched on 18 November 2002 by the Honorable President APJ [[Abdul Kalam]]. Till date Akshaya has been able to make 3.25 Million families e-literate.

When many renowned organizations came up with computer education Akshaya changed its direction to citizen delivery. Now Akshaya has emerged as one of the finest common service center networks in the nation.

RSBY Health Insurance Policy for 2 crore Population: Registered  160 thousand APL families and 2.8 million  BPL families. Renewal of policy  for 2.9millionfamilies. Akshaya’s performance to register 20lacs families in RSBY within 45 days through proactive citizen service is unparalleled compared to the similar venture of third party agents who has registered 15 lacs families in one year.

5.5 million citizens enrolled  under UID  through Akshaya Centers: In UID Enrollment Akshaya has the highest quality of 92.7% against the national average of 62%. Akshaya is also a premier agency in UID Enrollment having generated 75% of total UIDs in Kerala.

Partnership with Commercial Taxes helped Kerala to achieve 100% [[VAT Return]]s.

[[Intel Learn Program]] covered 100 thousand school children.

[[Government of India]] selected to provide consultancy service to [[Union Territory of Lakshadweep]] to launch CSCs. Akshaya has so far succeeded to launch CSCs in Lakshadweep in a time bound manner followed by roll out of e-literacy and G2C services.

Inclusive Development

By reaching the remote rural locations of the State on a sustainable basis, and offering a variety of world-class services, the Akshaya e-centres would encourage social inclusion of hitherto hereby marginalized communities and under-privileged sections of the rural society.

The project opens up immense opportunities for women participation at various levels as entrepreneurs, master trainers, social animators and finally as trainees etc. The higher level of response from women sector is due to the factor that the project creates opportunities at their doorsteps.

Women Participation and Empowerment: The Project has brought to the fore the enormous managerial and entrepreneurial talent of women that remains untapped.  The number of women who have come forward with the choice of an entrepreneurial career by starting an Akshaya e-centre is significant. The women entrepreneurs account for around 33% of the total entrepreneurs of the project selected in the first level in seven districts.

Villages Being Transformed: It has not been uncommon for villagers to travel long distances to district/taluk headquarters in order to obtain copies of public records, submit applications, meet officials, or to seek information regarding their day-to-day needs or to enquire prevailing prices in commodity markets etc. This involves the loss of a day's income as well as the cost of transportation. Once at the government office, the relevant record, information, or official could be unavailable, forcing repeated visits and additional expenses. In effect, government officials working with paper records enjoy a monopoly over information. Villagers may also face discomfort, harassment, and corruption on the part of public officials, or are often given incorrect information about government programs or market prices. In fact, compared to urban populace, the rural people were often forced to pay a disproportionate share of their income for gathering information.

In this context, much has been said about the potential use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) by government agencies to transform relations with citizens and businesses. Increased transparency, less corruption, better delivery of government services, greater government responsiveness and accountability, and empowerment of citizens – especially poor ones – are commonly cited among the possible benefits of e-governance.

But, in villages, direct ownership and use of ICT – for instance through a PC with internet access – applies only to a very minimal fraction of the population. Although the availability of content in local languages and the use of graphic and voice interfaces can make e-government applications more accessible to rural people, illiteracy and low levels of education are powerful obstacles to the use of computers and other ICT tools. It follows that, in most cases, rural people have to rely on a human intermediary between them and ICT applications.

It was under this context that the Government of Kerala conceived the Project – Akshaya – for the benefit of people in the State, especially rural population. Access to information, backed with relevant infrastructure and services, not only allows rural populace to improve its quality of life but also support and supplement its existing incomes in a sustainable way. Access to information and services like e-governance, micro-credit, literacy, education, health, etc., can provide a solid foundation for the economic prosperity of rural villages. Moreover, it is a well-stated fact that rural consumers are willing to pay for products and services that meet their needs and are offered at affordable prices. Therefore, what needs is a new social contract – in which there will be common access infrastructure, provided at commercial prices rather than given for free.

Akshaya Project is an enormous step towards making the Government accessible to citizens, in ways that can not only save huge costs to the Government but also make it more transparent and efficient in its day-to-day interactions with the common man. To that effect, the role of Akshaya e-centres, envisioned as the front-end delivery network for Government services is remarkable for the strides it has already made.

Akshaya Project envisages to be a bottom-up model for imparting e-literacy training, delivery of content, services, information and knowledge, that can allow like-minded public and private enterprises – through a collaborative framework – to integrate their goals of profit as well as social objectives, into a sustainable business model for achieving rapid socio-economic change in rural villages of the State.

As stated above 2328 e-centres out of 2662 Akshaya e-centres (87.50%) are in rural areas. This is going to be enhanced to 3180 in the near future thus covering every part of the State, even the remotest villages. The very first target of the Project is to train one person from 64 families of the State thereby empowering rural population in using the advantages of ICT for their day-to-day applications. This has started creating a knowledge power to bridge the ‘digital divide’. The value additions thus gained are certainly augmenting the well being and overall economic development of rural populace in the State.

Akshaya won the 2005 [[Prix Ars Electronica#Digital Communities|Prix Ars Electronica]] in the ''Digital Communities'' category.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6087">'''Allegra Kent''' (born August 11, 1937) is an American [[ballet dancer]], actress, children's book author and columnist.

==Life and career==
'''Iris Margo Cohen''' was born to Jewish parents, Harry Herschel and Shirley (née Weissman) Cohen, and later changed her name to Allegra Kent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/kent-allegra Kent Allegra] Jewish Women's Archive, accessed May 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Kent grew up in what she later described as a dysfunctional environment. In ''Once a Dancer: An Autobiography'', she describes her [[Texas|Texan]] father &amp;ndash; "who liked to substitute 'Cowboy' for Herschel" &amp;ndash; as having "a gambler's soul and a restless nature".&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1997), pp. 5, 7)&lt;/ref&gt; She describes her [[Wisznice]]-born immigrant mother as feeling "neither European nor American; she was ashamed of her [own] parents. She borrowed a neighbor's working papers and took a job at twelve. By fourteen, she was teaching ballroom dancing at night in someone's private home, mostly to Japanese men".&lt;ref&gt;Kent (1997), p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], Kent studied with [[Bronislava Nijinska]] and [[Carmelita Maracci]] before joining the [[School of American Ballet]]. She discovered music and dance at the age of 7 and enjoyed both, but she was 11 before she took her first ballet lesson. She had completely flat feet as a little girl and consulted a doctor, who prescribed wedges in her shoes to give her arches. She then began taking [[ballet]].

After graduating, she joined the [[New York City Ballet]] in 1953 at the age of 15, and was promoted to principal in 1957. Many roles in [[George Balanchine]]'s ballets were created for her, including ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (ballet chanté)|Seven Deadly Sins]]'', ''[[Ivesiana]]'' and ''[[Bugaku (ballet)|Bugaku]]''. She danced the role of Dewdrop in the 1958 [[Playhouse 90]] telecast of Balanchine's version of ''[[The Nutcracker (Balanchine)|The Nutcracker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danceviewtimes.com/dvny/features/2003/nutcrackertv.htm Review of Allegra Kent in ''The Nutcracker''], danceviewtimes.com (2003); Retrieved November 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

She performed in such ballets as ''[[Serenade (ballet)|Serenade]]'', ''[[Agon (ballet)|Agon]]'' and ''[[Dances at a Gathering]]''. She retired in 1981, becoming a ballet teacher, and in 1997 published an autobiography, ''Once a Dancer''. In 2012, Kent published her first book for children, ''Ballerina Swan'', with [[Holiday House|Holiday House Books for Young People]], illustrated by Caldecott Medalist [[Emily Arnold McCully]].  It has received good reviews from ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Jennifer B. (May 9, 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/books/ballerina-swan-bea-at-ballet-and-invitation-to-ballet.html "Step by Step: 'Ballerina Swan,' 'Bea at Ballet' and 'Invitation to Ballet'"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.

The operation was botched and Kent fell into a deep depression because of it. Balanchine dropped several roles for her because of it.

In 2013, ''Ballerina Swan'' was adapted for the stage as a dance piece by New York City Children's Theater,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nycchildrenstheater.org/shows-and-programs/ballerina-swan-2013-production/|title=Ballerina Swan (2013) - NYC Children's Theater|work=NYC Children's Theater|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring choreographer Michael McGowan and artistic director Barbara Zinn Krieger.

==Biography==
Fagin was the daughter of Mae and Harry Mintzer, immigrants to [[New York City]]. Her parents wished for her to become a physician like her aunt, who was a dermatologist in Queens.&lt;ref name=Fearless&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manchester|first1=Lee|title=Fearless|url=http://wagner.edu/wagnermagazine/?p=1469|accessdate=December 14, 2014|work=Wagner Magazine|issue=Fall 2011|publisher=[[Wagner College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She elected to study nursing at [[Wagner College]] and earned a doctorate at [[New York University]]. Her doctoral dissertation covered the concept of "rooming in" for parents of hospitalized children. She continued her research in this area, which influenced the perception of parental visitation in hospitals.&lt;ref name=ANA&gt;{{cite web|title=ANA’S 2010 Hall of Fame and Honorary Awards Program|url=http://www.nursingworld.org/clairemfagin|publisher=[[American Nurses Association]]|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She served as Dean of the School of Nursing at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1977 to 1992, when she left to do geriatric nursing research as a Scholar in Residence at the [[Institute of Medicine]], [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. She was Presidential Chair in early 1993 at the [[University of California, San Francisco]].

In 1993 she was named interim president of the University of Pennsylvania (from July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1994), the first woman to serve in the capacity of a university president with any [[Ivy League]] university.

The '''Council for Economic Education'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforeconed.org/ CEE Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; (the new name, since 2009 January, of the National Council on Economic Education) is an organization in the United States that focuses on the economic and financial education of students from kindergarten through high school.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobeNov2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Buote|first=Brenda J.|title=Learning financial sense|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2013/11/03/shawsheen-valley-technical-high-students-learn-abc-personal-finance|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=3 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Council for Economic Education is to instill in young people the fourth “R”—a real-world understanding of [[economics]] and [[personal finance]]. It is only by acquiring economic and [[financial literacy]] that children can learn that there are better options for a life well lived, will be able to see opportunity on their horizon line and, ultimately, can grow into successful and productive adults capable of making informed and responsible decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforeconed.org/about/ "About us" from the Council website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquartered in [[New York City]], CEE provides classroom resources to K-12 teachers and students, free professional development to educators, webinars, standards and assessment tools, and guidance for advocacy and outreach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforeconed.org/about/ "About us" from Council website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign for Economic Literacy==
The Council for Economic Education is working on a campaign to increase economic literacy.

===Classroom Reach===
It was reported in 2013 that five million K-12 students annually used the Council for Economic Education's personal-finance and economics education.&lt;ref name=StarTribuneJune2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Bjorhus|first=Jennifer|title=Aggressive Hydraulics opens new headquarters in East Bethel, MN|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/211608851.html|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council for Economic Education’s (CEE) Survey of the States===
The Council for Economic Education measures through a biennial survey financial literacy education across the United States by state.&lt;ref name=USATodayNov2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Malcolm|first=Hadley|title=Financial literacy education has real-life impact|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/11/13/financial-literacy-education-requirements/2953667/|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=USA TODAY|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Economics Challenge===
The National Economics Challenge (NEC) is a high school economics competition. Each year, over 11,000 students across the U.S. participate in the competition. The Challenge recognizes exceptional high school students for their knowledge of economic principles and their ability to apply problem-solving and critical-thinking skills to real-world events. 

The National Economics Challenge is the only national competition of its kind, with students showcasing their knowledge of economics in a fun, challenging, and rewarding contest. The competition begins at the state level, with state champions advancing to the National Semi-Final round and the top performers subsequently advancing to the National Final round, which is held in New York City. Teams of four students answer rigorous questions on microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, and current events. At the National Final level, students complete rounds of multiple choice testing, work in teams to solve critical thinking case problems, and participate in a quick-paced oral quiz bowl in order to earn the title of National Economics Challenge Champions.

The National Economics Challenge offers a two-division contest format based on students’ economics coursework. The Adam Smith division is designed for students who are enrolled in Advanced Placement, international baccalaureate and honors economics courses. The David Ricardo division is fashioned for students who have received a general economics education, typically of one semester or less. The two-division system provides high school students of varying levels of economics practice with the chance to compete against their peers.

The Council for Economic Education sponsors the National Economics Challenge.

===Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics===

===National Content Standards in Personal Finance===
The Council for Economic Education released its National Content Standards in Personal Finance in March 2013 that are a personal finance course for high.&lt;ref name=CourierJournalMarch2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Gerwing|first=Maria|title=Teens need a financial education|newspaper=Courier-Journal (Louisville, Kentucky)|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annual Financial Literacy and Economic Education Conference===
The Annual Conference is a nationwide meeting of K–12 educators, CEE affiliates from across the country, Federal Reserve partners, and other educators in this field. The conference features a selection of professional development workshops on economic and financial literacy geared for elementary, middle and high school levels. Topics include pedagogy and resources, curriculum strategy for schools/school districts, teaching strategies, assessment and research, new programs and best practices. In addition to the workshops, speakers address current economic and financial topics to enable educators to bring these perspectives back to their classrooms. The conference also features roundtable sessions led by master teachers to discuss shared issues and successes, and informal opportunities for networking.

The '''Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education''' is an international [[charitable organization]] and education center located in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.  Established in 2005, the center describes its mission as "educate the hearts of children by informing, inspiring and engaging the communities around them".&lt;ref name="Gram"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urgent"/&gt;

The organization is advised by several prominent leaders involved in peace-making and has organized events centered on discussions of spirituality, climate change, the environment, peace and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dalailamacenter.org/events/past |title=Past events &amp;#124; Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education |publisher=dalailamacenter.org |accessdate=2010-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and mission==
The [[14th Dalai Lama]]'s ties with Vancouver, Canada date from the early 1960s when Vancouver-based writer [[George Woodcock]] traveled to India to support Tibetan exiles and met the Dalai Lama.  Over the years, the Dalai Lama visited Vancouver several times, in 1980, 1993, 2004, 2006 and 2009.  The Dalai Lama's brother, Tendzin Choegyal, also has close ties with the city, having traveled there often to give speeches and teach.&lt;ref name="Todd1"/&gt;

Victor Chan, a 30-year friend of the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], is founding director of the center.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;  Chan co-authored a book with the Dalai Lama called, ''The Wisdom of Forgiveness''.&lt;ref name="Todd"/&gt; According to the Dalai Lama, Vancouver was chosen as the center's location because it is "multiethnic and multiracial population gives it harmony."&lt;ref name="Associated"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hainsworth"/&gt;

The center was formally inaugurated in September 2006 in Vancouver.  The Dalai Lama, in attendance at the event, was awarded honorary Canadian citizenship by the government of Canada.&lt;ref name="Associated"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;  Also attending the inauguration were [[Tim Shriver]], [[Deepak Chopra]], and [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]].&lt;ref name="Todd1"/&gt;  James Hoggan &amp; Associates provided public relations services for the event.&lt;ref name="Dalai Lama Center"/&gt;

The center originally announced its intention to have a permanent facility constructed by 2009.&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bellett"/&gt;  In a 2006 interview with the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'', Chan explained that the center's facility would be 4,645 square meters and include an outdoor European-style piazza, [[Zen]] garden, bookstore, film-screening theater, performing arts theater, art gallery, library, and studios for classes or group discussions.  Chan stated that the facility would highlight the Dalai Lama's international connections, invite guest speakers, host interfaith dialogues, and hold discussions on peaceful resolutions to conflicts.  Chan added that half of the center's $60 million budget would go to operating costs, research, local programming, and an endowment, and the rest towards construction of the facility and a meditative retreat.&lt;ref name="Bellett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gram1"/&gt;  As of March 2010, however, the center's website indicated that the organization had yet to construct a physical facility.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

In a press release, the organization stated that its goals were to, 

{{quote|Reach out and be open to all people, regardless of faith, culture or political affiliation. It will work to strengthen the bonds of human connection among all peoples and to share knowledge and explore principles that encourage people to live well together. The Center will translate the Dalai Lama's teachings on kindness, compassion and interconnectedness into programs directed at creating a more just and harmonious world.&lt;ref name="Dalai Lama Center"/&gt;}}

The Center added that it hopes to achieve this goal by promoting human values and stressing a sense of oneness with humanity.&lt;ref name="Dalai Lama Center"/&gt;

==Governance==
The Center has an international advisory board which is chaired by the Dalai Lama and includes:
* [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]]

==Notable events==

===Vancouver Peace Summit===

The Center sponsored a summit in Vancouver in September 2009, called "The Vancouver Peace Summit".  In various dialogues, including "World Peace through Personal Peace", "Nobel Laureates in Dialogue", and "Educating the Heart", speakers discussed spirituality, science, psychotherapy, the arts, business, and education.  In attendance at the Summit were the Dalai Lama, [[Maria Shriver]], [[Matthieu Ricard]], [[Mary Robinson]], [[Eckhart Tolle]], [[Stephen Covey]], [[Mairead Maguire]], [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]], [[Jody Williams]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]], and the [[Blue Man Group]].  The event was held at the [[Chan Centre for the Performing Arts]] and the Orpheum and was attended by 5,000 people.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Watch"/&gt;

===Be The Village. Dialogues with the Dalai Lama. Vancouver 2014===

The Dalai Lama returned to Vancouver in October, 2014 to take part in a panel discussion with Kimberly Schonert-Reichl, Tamara Vrooman and Janet Austen, with special guest Peter Senge. The focus of the discussion was the advancement of Heart-Mind well-being in children and youth.&lt;ref&gt;https://vancouversun.com/Dalai+Lama+returns+foster+empathy+students/10154740/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speaker Series===
{{Advert|section|date=June 2012}}
Since its creation in 2005, the Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education (DLC) has hosted a number of events.  
One of the Center’s programs is the Speakers Series, focusing on areas of interest to the Dalai Lama and the Center. These include science and its relationship to spirituality, education of the heart and related research, and the development of compassion and its contribution to the public good. Public events are held throughout the year.

In June 2010 the Speakers Series guests included John Helliwell, UBC Professor Emeritus of Economics and Officer of the Order of Canada; Dr Elizabeth Dunn, assistant professor in the UBC Department of Psychology; and Bill Harbaugh, economics professor at the University of Oregon, for a discussion on [http://dalailamacenter.org/event/money-generosity-and-happiness-john-helliwell-elizabeth-dunn-and-bill-harbaugh “Money, Generosity and Happiness.”] The panelists presented their latest research from economics, social psychology and neuroscience. They discussed altruism, charitable giving, and factors that promote well-being and happiness in individuals and society.

In March [[Jody Williams]] gave an [http://dalailamacenter.org/event/speaker-series-intimate-evening-nobel-peace-laureate-jody-williams intimate talk] about the work of herself and her colleagues to ban [[landmine]]s, recognized by the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Williams also spoke promoting human rights through the work of the Nobel Women’s Initiative.
 
Earlier that month psychologist [[Paul Ekman]] made a presentation on [http://dalailamacenter.org/event/speaker-series-paul-ekman-darwin-dalai-lama-and-nature-compassion “Darwin, the Dalai Lama and the Nature of Compassion.”]

Throughout 2007–2009, the Speakers Series hosted [[Marc Brackett]], [[Arthur Zajonc]], [[Daniel Goleman]], [[Robert Putnam]], [[Stephen G. Post]], [[Reginald Ray]], [[Daniel Siegel]], and [[Richard Davidson]].
 
The DLC often co-sponsors events with other organizations, such as the [[Vancouver Board of Trade]] and Hollyhock Foundation.

'''''Detroit''''' is a turn-based [[business simulation game]] that puts one in charge of a fledgling automobile company starting in 1908 (the year the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Model T|Model T]] was introduced). The player is responsible for the financing, research and development, design, testing, production, and marketing of automobile product lines. The aim of the game is to be the most profitable automobile business in the world after 100 years.

The game is named after the American city of [[Detroit]] which is nicknamed "Motor City" due to the concentration of American automobile manufacturers in the city during the 20th century.

==Gameplay==
The player starts off with a factory and a number of distributors. The player is always set against three competitors, which can be either human or computer. The game tends to follow common steps in a project lifecycle which involves the planning of a product, development of a product, testing of a product and its release to the public. The player is expected to follow this process whenever they wish to develop a new automobile.

Each turn is one month, and the game lasts approximately 100 years. At the start of each month, the player is presented with a money ledger showing the prior month's business. At this time newspapers also announce if cars are doing well or if there are special world events. World events that vastly effect gameplay are: [[World War I]], [[The Great Depression]], [[World War II]], and the [[1973 oil crisis|energy crisis of the 1970s]]. Most of these events negatively affect demand for all cars, with the exception of the energy crisis which targets low-mileage vehicles.

If at any time the player is bankrupt for long enough, the game ends with a scene of the player's avatar jumping out of a window.

The different aspects of the business are covered by different buildings at the factory (which is actually a pictorial representation of the main menu). Clicking on one of these buildings will bring up the following departments:

===Manager's office===
The manager's office acts as the player's interface to the numbers end of the business. Available from here is financial data concerning car models, factory production numbers, competition information, car reviews, and more. The player can manage the number of employees at factories, hire and fire new employees for factories, manage salaries (especially important to keep workers from striking), and commission reports to find out more about their automobiles.

A unique feature available in the manager's office is the ability to print most reports to the computer's printer.

===Research and development===
The research and development screen allows the player to invest their researchers into fields of development. These fields range from aesthetic changes such as body shape) to more technical ones such as new engines, suspension, brakes, safety and luxury features. The game references many real-world auto features as the fields progress, such as "drum brakes", "windshield wipers", and more.

===Design and testing===
One of the core parts of the gameplay is the ability to design new vehicles. Designing the body involves choosing what type of automobile (car, truck, etc.) and then three main sections of the car: the front, middle, and rear. Color can also be specified but has no discernible impact on the sales or reviews of the car.

As the player's research and development team develops more advanced features for the car, they become available on the design screen. However, all the parts have an associated cost and drive up the cost of the vehicle. They also affect the test results of the car. As time progresses, the public will demand different styles of car. For example, in the energy crisis, consumers will demand more fuel efficient cars. Ultimately it can be a game of trial-and-error finding a vehicle that the public likes.

During the testing phase the car is tested and then given a rating for handling in a corner, braking, acceleration, capacity (cargo and passenger), fuel economy, and safety. Generally, the better performance of the car, the more likely its success, especially if it conforms to the demands of the time or excels against the competition.

===Manufacturing and sales===
The manufacturing and sales screen allows the player to manage the production and distribution of vehicles. A world map of territories is displayed, whereby the player can click individual territories to display the factory and showroom in a territory. Here one can open or close down new factories and showrooms or upgrade the level of factories to make them more productive. Supply routes between factories and showrooms are also set and prioritized on this screen. The price of vehicles in each territory can also be set here.

===Marketing===
Here the player can invest funds into marketing of vehicles through various forms of media. Some will be more effective than others depending in which year the player is at in the game. Examples of media one can advertise with include billboards, newspapers, women's magazines, radio and television.

==Bugs and limitations==
* The game shipped with a bug where sometimes workers would disappear from production and research lines. The patch that fixes the bug introduces a problem whereby sometimes lines would inexplicably gain thousands of workers, drowning the player in overhead.
* All production (and research) lines are limited to 255 workers each. Factories are limited to six lines apiece.
* Many times demand can inexplicably decline or altogether cease for a vehicle, even if it is competitively priced and held in high reviews.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' rated ''Detroit'' two stars out of five. Describing it as "a puzzle game rather than a true strategy game", the magazine criticized the fixed demand values, repetitive gameplay, and unrealistic depiction of historical events.&lt;ref name="cgw199408"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Emrich |first=Alan |last2=Schlunk |first2=Petra |date=August 1994 |title='What's Good for GM is Good for America' |department= |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&amp;pub=2&amp;id=121 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deutsches Forschungsnetz''' ("German Research Network"), usually abbreviated to '''DFN''', is the [[Germany|German]] [[national research and education network]] (NREN) used for academic and research purposes. It is managed by the scientific community organized in the voluntary association "Verein zur Förderung eines Deutschen Forschungsnetzes [[Eingetragener Verein | e.V.]]" which was founded in 1984 by universities, non-university research institutions and research-oriented companies to stimulate computerized communication in Germany.

DFN's "super core" [[Backbone network | backbone]] [[X-WiN]] network points of presence are based in [[Erlangen]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hannover]] and [[Potsdam]]. These sites run [[Cisco CRS-1]] routers and are interconnected with each other by two 10 [[Gigabit Ethernet]] connections.

All upstream connections (to networks such as [[GÉANT2]] (in Frankfurt&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geant.net/Media_Centre/Media_Library/Media%20Library/10G_fibre_2009.jpg GÉANT 10G Fibre Map 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806092728/http://www.geant.net/Media_Centre/Media_Library/Media%20Library/10G_fibre_2009.jpg |date=2011-08-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[DECIX]]) are 10G-based and are implemented at the super core.

'''Education in Malta''' is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] through age sixteen and is offered through three different providers: the [[State school|state]], the [[church school|church]], and the [[private school|private sector]]. The state is responsible for promoting education and instruction and ensuring universal access to education for all Maltese citizens the existence of a system of schools and institutions accessible to all Maltese citizens. The objectives of education in Malta include intellectual and moral development and the preparation of every citizen to contribute productively to the national economy. Although Maltese citizens had access to education during the Arab administration of 870 to 1090, the arrival of a number of religious orders in the following four centuries brought religious-based education to the island for wealthy families. The arrival of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] saw the establishment of the [[University of Malta]], around which a number of primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions were established. Education in Malta has been universally available at the primary level since the ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French in 1798, when state-funded elementary schooling was established. In 1878, English replaced Italian as the primary language of instruction, and education was made compulsory in 1946 in response to a number of children not attending school due to poverty between World Wars One and Two. The age at which education became compulsory was lowered to five years in 1988.

Malta's educational system is divided into four stages: pre-primary (ages 3–5), primary (ages 5–11), secondary (ages 11–16) and tertiary. Pre-primary education is optional but fully funded by the state. In their last ten years of primary education, students are placed on tracks based on educational attainment, and at the age of eleven, students sit an [[eleven plus exam]]ination to eliminate a student's secondary schooling direction. Success in the eleven plus exam places a student in a junior lyceum - a prestigious secondary school - while mediocre performance or not sitting the examination places a student in a less competitive secondary school. Secondary Education Certificate (NEC) examinations are taken at age 16, and matriculation examinations are taken at age 18 to determine university entrance eligibility. In 2008, 26,711 primary students, 25,793 secondary students, 5,719 post-secondary students, 9,472 tertiary students and 6,268 vocational students were enrolled in educational courses in Malta. Approximately 30 per cent of Malta's primary and secondary school students are enrolled in private schools, most of which are operated by the Catholic Church. Malta's highest post-secondary institution is the [[University of Malta]], which has operated since 1552

[[File:Sacra Infermeria hospital medical school Malta.jpg|thumb|right|alt=monumental stone building lit by floodlights at night |The historic Sacra Infermeria hospital, original site of the medieval University of Malta's medical school, now operates as the Mediterranean Conference Center.]]
While education in Malta dates back to the period of Arab occupation between 870 and 1090 through the introduction of [[Arabic numerals]], the arrival of the [[Franciscan]]s in 1350, the [[Carmelite]]s in 1418, the [[Dominican Order]] in 1450, the [[Augustinians]] in 1460 and the [[Friars Minor]] in 1492 brought religious-based education to the island. Members of these groups were asked to serve as private tutors for the children of wealthy parents, and later moved to set up classes for instruction in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latin]] and numeracy. In 1592, the Collegium Melitense (what was to become the [[University of Malta]]) was established by the [[Society of Jesus]] as a result of a direct order from [[Clements VIII|Pope Clements VIII]], and around this institution a number of others flourished, including a grammar school, a preparatory school and institutions for the study of [[cartography]], [[naval architecture]] and navigation. In addition to public options, it was possible to hire private tutors in a number of different areas, including accounting, philosophy, navigation and languages. During this period, however, education for those without wealth was non-existent.&lt;ref name=evolution&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Calleja |first1=James |last2= |first2= |year=1994 |title=The evolution of education in Malta.

This resulted in mass illiteracy by the end of the Order of St John and took until the second half of the 19th century, under British rule, to have a sprint towards further inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.08(1980-83)/MH.8(1980)1/orig01.pdf p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ejection of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] by the [[French Republic]] in 1798 brought a reformation of the educational system with it due to the disparity between the traditional ideals of the Knights and the revolutionary ideals of the French. Private schooling was banned, [[elementary school]]ing was introduced and funded by the state, and adult education was introduced. The gradual introduction of [[universal education]] for primary school students was an ideal born before and during the [[French Revolution]], while private schools were abolished due to their traditional association with the [[Catholic Church]], an institution rejected by those involved in the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/society/c_education.html|title=The Revolution, Napoleon, and education|last=Markham|first=J. David|year=2010|publisher=The Napoleon Series|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Napoleon I]] abolished the University of Malta just five days after his ejection of the Knights, although this decision was reversed after the British ejected the French the following year.&lt;ref name=unihist/&gt; In 1799, Malta fell under the jurisdiction of the [[United Kingdom]], and attempts were made to adjust Malta's institutions towards a British style. [[File:MLAupperBarakkaGarden.JPG|thumb|left|alt=bronze sculpture of three street children running playfully|This 1903 sculpture in [[Valletta]]'s Upper Barrakka Gardens, "Les Gavroches" by Maltese artist Antonio Sciortino, depicts the poverty children experienced in Malta in the early 20th century.]]

Under Government Ponsonby, in 1833, the Catholic Church in Malta was staunchly against public education; the only effort done by the [[priesthood]] is to demand people not to accept education or be condemned by [[excommunication]], together with other religious consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mreronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/JMERN1I1P61.pdf|journal=Journal of Maltese Education Research|publisher=Faculty of Education, University of Malta|volume=1|date=2003|issue=1|pages=96-118|title=Politics, Religion and Education in Ninteeth Century Malta|first=George|last=Cassar|issn=1726-9725}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.15(2008-11)/MH.15(2008)1/06.pdf p. 95]&lt;/ref&gt;
On 1 February 1846 education became effectively compulsory till the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150125/life-features/Elementary-education-in-Malta-during-the-early-British-period.553515&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, elementary schooling was changed to the British model, schools were opened in every village and education was made free of charge. In 1878, the mode of language education delivery changed following the publication of two reports on the matter. Italian language education was replaced by instruction in the [[English language]], and the use of [[Maltese language|Maltese]] was encouraged in the primary years. However, English was the language in which education was delivered at all stages of education following primary school. Debate continued until the 1930s over which language should be used in Maltese education - Italian or English.&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt;

During [[World War I]], the [[interwar years]] and [[World War II]], widespread poverty in Malta prevented the children of the lower classes from pursuing basic education in favor of staying home to assist parents with agricultural work and other income earning activities. To counteract this phenomenon, education was declared [[compulsory education|compulsory]] in 1946. In 1964, Malta became an independent nation, and in 1988 a new Education Act was passed, lowering the compulsory education age to five years, decentralising educational decision making and establishing a right for any person to apply for a licence to open a school. The Faculty of Arts, Sciences and Theology at the University of Malta was also reinstated.&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt;

== Statistics ==
In 2008, 26,711 primary students, 25,793 secondary students, 5,719 post-secondary students, 9,472 tertiary students and 6,268 vocational students were enrolled in educational courses in Malta.&lt;ref name=maltainfigures10&gt;{{cite book|title=Malta in Figures 2010|url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=2873|accessdate=January 26, 2011|year=2010|publisher=National Statistics Office|location=Valletta|isbn=978-99909-73-99-0 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 30 per cent of students of school age attend private schools, most of which are operated by the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=councilofeurope&gt;{{cite book|last1=van Haecht|first1=Anne|last2=Council of Europe|first2=|last3=Council for Cultural Co-operation|first3=|title=The division of responsibilities at national, regional and local levels in the education systems of twenty-three European countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXqiKJFST2cC|accessdate=January 26, 2011|year=1996|publisher=Council of Europe|location=Strasburg|isbn=92-871-2873-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 34.9 per cent of the population between 18 and 24 years of age had not completed secondary school,&lt;ref name=maltainfigures11&gt;{{cite book|title=Malta in Figures 2010|url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=2873|accessdate=January 26, 2011|year=2010|publisher=National Statistics Office|location=Valletta|isbn=978-99909-73-99-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2008 92 per cent of the population was considered [[literacy|literate]].&lt;ref name=unicefstats&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/malta.html|title=At a glance: Malta|year=2010|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malta ranks equal eleventh in the world on the [[IQ and Global Inequality|national IQ scale]].&lt;ref name=nationaliq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/national_iq_scores_country_ranks.html|title=National IQ scores - country rankings|last=Lynn|first=Richard|publisher=Countries of the World|accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[compulsory education]] period in Malta has been between five and 16 years of age since the introduction of the ''Education Act 1988''.&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt; This is an increase from up to 12 years of age in 1924 (in this year, school ''attendance'' became compulsory for those already enrolled - the act of enrollment itself was not compulsory) and 14 years of age in 1946, when compulsory school attendance was introduced for all students, enrolled or otherwise. Compulsory schooling has always applied to both males and females during its existence.&lt;ref name=admin&gt;{{cite book|title=The education system in Malta|url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/eurybase/eurybase_full_reports/MT_EN.pdf|accessdate=February 2, 2011|year=2007|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

=== School education ===

Schooling is compulsory from the age of five,&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt; although free-of-charge [[kindergarten]] is available to all students beginning at age three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/education/educoverview.html|title=Education in Malta: an overview|last=Sultana|first=Ronald|year=1997|publisher=PEG Publishers|accessdate=January 26, 2011|location=Valletta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 94 per cent of three- and four-year-olds attend kindergarten. A number of private operators exist, but free state-run institutions are also popular. State-run Maltese kindergartens are required to have one staff member present for every ten children present, while this ratio decreases to 1:20 for independently run institutions. During the kindergarten years, the focus is on play, not formal education. From kindergarten, students transition to primary school, which is compulsory from the age of five. Since 1980, all state-run primary schools have been [[co-educational]], with many independent schools following suit. However, church-run primary schools are usually single-sex. Classes usually have a limit of thirty students, and a minimum teacher to student ratio has been set at 1:19 in all schools, whether they be state-run, church-run or independent.&lt;ref name=systems&gt;{{cite book|last=Hörner|first=Wolfgang|title=The education systems of Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FI5hZqm2_0MC|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=1-4020-4868-8|pages=494–495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal end-of-year examinations commence starting in Year 4 to dictate class streaming arrangements for the following year. Students are examined in English, Maltese, mathematics, religion and social studies. Despite the fact that [[eleven plus exam|eleven-plus examinations]] highlight inequality and failures, and are recognized as ineffective educational tools by experts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murdoch|first=Stephen|title=IQ: a smart history of a failed idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFUnE5LuMswC|accessdate=January 26, 2011|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|page=152|location=Hoboken|isbn=0-471-69977-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=Stephen|last2=Eden|first2=Christine|title=Key Issues in Education Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZSJ2BRb3wYC|accessdate=January 26, 2011|year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=1-84787-466-5|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Margaret Eastman|title=Reckoning With the Past: Teaching history in Northern Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iL_zjLaUCxAC&amp;q=eleven+plus#v=snippet&amp;q=eleven%20plus%20attend&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 26, 2011|year=2005|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham|isbn=0-7391-0798-4|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malta still implements such exams.&lt;ref name=differentiated/&gt; In Year 6, when most pupils have turned eleven years of age, an eleven-plus exam is given to students to determine which students attend which secondary schools. Students are tested in English language, Maltese language, mathematics, social studies and religion; the latter is optional for those not adhering to the faith taught in schools. While 73 per cent of eleven-year-old students sat the eleven-plus exam in 2001, only about 54 percent pass it each year. Students achieving success in the eleven-plus exam go on to attend prestigious 'junior lyceums' during their secondary years, whilst those who do not attend 'area secondary schools'. This is similar to the operation of the [[Tripartite System]] in the United Kingdom following [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=systems/&gt;

State-run junior lyceums and area secondary schools are single-sex. Junior lyceums are divided into two grade stages. The first stage is an introductory stage, and runs for the first two years of secondary schooling. Students study essentially the same subjects with very limited curriculum options in order to provide a good grounding for future studies. Following the two-year introductory cycle, a three-year specialist stage occurs during which students study a common core curriculum as well as a number of elective subjects. This orientation is similar at area secondary schools, although the introductory period is longer, at three years in duration, and the final specialist period is shorter, at two years. The staff-student ratio is set at 1:11, and the school leaving age is 16.&lt;ref name=systems/&gt;

Examinations in Maltese secondary schools are taken at both age 16 and 18, with the latter being a final optional set of matriculation examinations. The examinations taken at age 16 are the Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) exams, which have operated since 1994, before which the [[GCE Ordinary Level]] was used as a secondary certificate examination. The examinations taken at 18, those enabling entry into university, are the Matriculation Certificate examinations, based on the [[International Baccalaureate]]. These examinations replaced the [[GCE Advanced Level]]s.&lt;ref name=differentiated&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spbea.org.fj/aceab/Grima2.pdf |title=The Secondary Education Certificate Examination in Malta: An Evaluation of the Differentiated Paper System |last=Grima |first=Grace |publisher=University of Malta |accessdate=January 26, 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009135334/http://www.spbea.org.fj/aceab/Grima2.pdf |archivedate=October 9, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Day-to-day operation ===
A number of students travel to school using the nation's [[transport in Malta|bus network]], which is free for state school students to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dolceta.eu/malta/Mod5/spip.php?page=spipdf&amp;spipdf=spipdf_article&amp;id_article=330&amp;nom_fichier=article_330|title=Using school transport|publisher=Dolceta.eu|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools in Malta generally begin their school day at 8:30am and finish at 2:40pm.&lt;ref name=secularhs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secular-homeschooling.com/006/malta.html|title=A letter from Malta|last=Markus|first=Deborah|date=Spring 2009|publisher=Secular Homeschooling Magazine|accessdate=February 2, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106082257/http://www.secular-homeschooling.com/006/malta.html|archivedate=January 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students receive three days of holidays in November 15 days of holidays over Christmas, two days of holidays in March and eight days of holidays in April, in addition to [[public holiday]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/calendars/102en.pdf|title=Organisation of school time in Europe|publisher=[[European Commission]]|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maltese school students receive the highest number of days off of all school students in Europe, with 90 days during the 2010-11 academic year being non-school days. This is 14 days more than the European average of 76.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=112002|title=‘No correlation’ between number of holidays and academic excellence|last=Calleja|first=Stephen|publisher=The Malta Independent|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all Maltese state schools run [[tuck shop]]s, while some secondary schools are home to [[cafeteria]]s.&lt;ref name="malta?!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.mt/edu/educ_guide_to_education.htm|title=Malta?! - a guide to education and vocational training|publisher=Ministry of Education, Employment and the Family|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State schools provide textbooks free of charge to their students, while private schools generally require their students to pay for their textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[English language|English]] and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and two and a half hours per week to physical education and religion. State school syllabi at the secondary level are set by the local examination bodies.&lt;ref name="malta?!"/&gt;

=== Tertiary education ===
Under the ''Education Act of 1988'', the [[Government of Malta]] is obligated to provide free university education to eligible residents with sufficient qualifications for entry. However, due to funding constraints, the [[University of Malta]] offers some courses only every other year in order to maximise course offerings with optimum funding usage.&lt;ref name=systems/&gt; 10,000 students currently study at the University. Most [[Bachelor degree]] courses run for three years, including law, which in other [[common law countries]] is often lengthier.&lt;ref name=universityofmalta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.um.edu.mt/for/prospective|title=Prospective students|year=2010|publisher=University of Malta|accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Educational management]]==

=== Administration ===
State-run education in Malta is administered at the national level of government, with the Minister for Education empowered to make orders, or 'Legal Notices', relating to the administration of education throughout the country. The Minister for Education is appointed by the [[President of Malta|President]] on advice of the [[Prime Minister of Malta|Prime Minister]] and is responsible for a number of education-related government functions (such as the operation of schools and libraries) as well as tertiary education in the country. The Ministry of Education, the national government department responsible for education in Malta, is headed by a Permanent Secretary. The Education Division of the Ministry is responsible for setting a number of annual nationwide examinations, managing human resources in Malta's educational system, selecting school textbook lists, allocating students to schools based on area, managing the Ministry's educational finances and promoting a number of cultural, sporting and social activities. Malta's Ministry of Education is currently being decentralised with the aim of having schools managed at the local level.&lt;ref name=admin/&gt;

With the exception of the currently occurring [[educational management]] decentralisation process, regional administration of education in Malta is limited. However, the island of [[Gozo]] does maintain a form of regional educational administration through the Ministry for Gozo. Although the Ministry for Education manages education throughout Malta, the Ministry for Gozo is responsible for the remuneration of the island's teaching staff. Local authorities such as Malta's numerous Local Councils have no official ties to Malta's educational system but often donate to local schools and maintain preschool building structures.&lt;ref name=admin/&gt;

=== Teacher development ===
Primary and secondary school teachers begin their teacher education at the [[University of Malta]] by gaining a Bachelor of Education (Honours), which typically takes four years of study to achieve. To gain entry into the University to study primary or secondary education, students must not only meet the University's general entry requirements but also a number of other special course requirements. University students seeking to enter the teaching profession may also become qualified by gaining a [[postgraduate certificate in education]]. Two years of professional teaching practice is also generally required. The Minister for Education may also grant a temporary warrant to teach, valid for one year, to any person the Minister believes has the ability to teach in the country.&lt;ref name=admin/&gt;

In 2007, teachers entering the workforce were paid a minimum of [[Euro|€]]14,291 per year, with the most experienced teachers being paid €19,371 per year. Heads of School received a minimum of €17,242 per year. In 2003-04, there were 8,964 teaching staff in Malta, of which 6,630 worked at state schools.&lt;ref name=admin/&gt;

Cabeza de Baca was part of a prominent New Mexican family and one of four siblings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was a descendant of [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer, [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca|Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Baca]].{{Sfn|Rudnick|2012|p=72}} Her paternal great-grandfather was awarded the title to the Las Vegas Grandes land grant in 1823.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newmexicohistory.org/people/fabiola-cabeza-de-baca|title=Fabiola Cabeza de Baca|last=Sullivan|first=Michael Ann|date=|website=New Mexico History.org|publisher=|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also related to the second Governor of New Mexico, [[Ezequiel Cabeza De Baca|Ezequiel Cabeza de Baca]], who was her uncle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cabeza de Baca was born in and lived part of her life [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]].{{Sfn|Rudnick|2012|p=72}} She also grew up on a [[ranch]] in La Liendre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmwomensforum.com/images/NewMexicoHistoricWomenMarkers.pdf|title=New Mexico Historic Women Marker Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=New Mexico Women's Forum|publisher=|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother died when she was four, and her paternal grandmother raised her afterwards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her grandmother instilled the idea of "[[Noblesse oblige|''nobless oblige'']]" in Cabeza de Baca.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_62IjQ-XQScC&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=%22fabiola%20cabeza%20de%20baca%22&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fabiola%20cabeza%20de%20baca%22&amp;f=false|title=Latinas in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia|last=Pounce|first=Merrihelen|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780253111692|editor-last=Ruiz|editor-first=Vicki L.|volume=1|location=Bloomington|pages=104–105|chapter=Cabeza de Baca, Fabiola (1894-1991)|quote=|editor-last2=Korrol|editor-first2=Virginia Sanchez|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young woman, Cabeza de Baca "refused to take on her 'proper' role as a Spanish lady" and spent her time riding horses and watching the ranch men work.{{Sfn|Rudnick|2012|p=72}} When she was twelve, she visited [[Spain]].{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=61}}

Cabeza de Baca first attended a [[Catholic school]], where she was expelled from Loreto Academy's [[kindergarten]] for slapping a [[nun]].{{Sfn|Rudnick|2012|p=72}}&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She later went to New Mexico Normal College, where she earned her teaching certificate in 1912.{{Sfn|Rudnick|2012|p=72}} In the year of her graduation, her family was nearly [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] because of serious economic hardships.{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=61}} In 1921 she earned a bachelor's degree in [[pedagogy]] and visited Spain a second time.{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=61}} Later, she would earn a second bachelor's degree in [[home economics]] from [[New Mexico State University]] (NMSU) in 1929.{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=61}}

Her first job was teaching in a one-room schoolhouse in 1916.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her father was opposed to her teaching, but she insisted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She continued to teach school in the New Mexico public school system for a few years, and after receiving her degree from NMSU, began to work as an [[Agricultural extension|extension agent]] for [[Hispanic]] and [[Pueblo]] villages in New Mexico&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as part of the New Mexico [[Agricultural extension|Agricultural Extension Service]] (NMAES).

While visiting homes, she collected cultural information, recipes, stories and more.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some of these were published in the Santa Fe ''Nuevo Mexicana''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She also hosted a [[Multilingualism|bilingual]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; weekly radio show related to [[homemaking]] on the station, [[KVSF-FM|KVSF]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1929, she [[Elopement|eloped]] with Carlos Gilbert, an insurance agent and member of the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] (LULAC).{{Sfn|Rudnick|2012|p=74}} The match was not approved of by her father,{{Sfn|Rudnick|2012|p=74}} and the couple divorced after 10 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her husband's activism affected Cabeza de Baca, who became involved with Hispanic [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1932, she was injured by a train car, which resulted in having one of her legs [[Amputation|amputated]].{{Sfn|Rudnick|2012|p=75}} While she recovered for a period of two years, she continued to write and eventually returned to work, visiting homes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1935, she and several other women founded  [[La Sociedad Folklorica]] in Santa Fe as an organization "dedicated to preserving Spanish Language and Hispanic traditions in Santa Fe."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During [[World War II]], she helped women create [[Victory Gardens]] and set up [[Child care|childcare]] for women who were working.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1950, [[UNESCO]] sent Cabeza de Baca to [[Pátzcuaro]] to teach modern food and agriculture techniques to students.{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=62}} In 1959, she retired from working as an extension agent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In her retirement, she continued to preserve Spanish culture and was involved with the La Sociedad Folklorica of Santa Fe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was also active in the [[Peace Corps]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In May 1984, she entered into a [[Nursing home care|nursing home]].{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=62}} On October 14, 1991, Cabeza de Baca died in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was buried near [[Newkirk, New Mexico]] on the family's ranch.{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=62}}

== Writing ==
Her book, ''Historic Cookery'', first published in 1931, collected traditional [[recipe]]s from the area, emphasizing "basic New Mexico foods."{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=62}} It was written with an "Anglo audience in mind."{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=63}} ''Historic Cookery'' also marked the first time that New Mexican recipes were written down with "exact measurements."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1959, Cabeza de Baca and chef as the Alvarado Hotel worked to update the recipes in ''Historic Cookery'' to modern techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8540488//|title=Baile Antiguo|last=|first=|date=10 April 1959|work=Albuquerque Journal|access-date=24 January 2017|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book sold over 100,000 copies,{{Sfn|Rudnick|2012|p=73}} and was republished many times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A copy of this book was sent to the governor of each state in the US by [[Thomas J. Mabry|Thomas Mabry]] along with a bag of [[pinto bean]]s.{{Sfn|Rudnick|2012|p=73}} Her work helped introduce cooking with [[Chili pepper|chile]] to the American public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tastetalks.com/cinco-de-mayo-mexican-food-1778851953.html|title=Let's Give More Credit to Mexican Chefs, Shall We?|last=Finney|first=Teresa|date=5 May 2016|website=Taste Talks|publisher=|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabeza de Baca's second cookbook, ''The Good Life: New Mexico Traditions and Foods'' was first published in 1949 and was one of the first cookbooks to "place recipes within the historic and cultural contexts out of which they grew."{{Sfn|Rudnick|2012|p=73-74}} The book contained a fictional family, the Turrieta family, which represented the people that she met as an extension agent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The book also describes regional differences in [[New Mexican cuisine]].{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=63}}

Her [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] narrative, ''We Fed Them Cactus'' (1954), describes the life of New Mexican [[Hispanos]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and documents four generations of her family.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The title refers to a major drought that caused her family to have to feed [[cactus]] to their [[cattle]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The story is narrated by El Cuate, or the camp cook, and the narrative in ''We Fed Them Cactus'' is meant to "counter Anglo-American stereotyping of wealthy and corrupt landowners of the ''rico'' class."{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=63}}

Between 1958 and 1961 she wrote and edited for a magazine she helped found, the ''Santa Fe Scene''.{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=62}}

Later [[Chicano]] readings of Cabeza de Baca's work were critical of her writing, which was seen as "elitist and not representative of the realistic Chicano experience."{{Sfn|Davis|2000|p=64}} Despite this criticism, her writing has been viewed by Hispanic literary critics as a precursor to [[Xicana literature|Chicana literature]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Free response''', usually referred to as '''[[essay]]''', is a type of question used in tests in [[education]], [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], and [[government]]. Most free response questions ask or require the test-taker to state a [[belief]], [[opinion]], or write a short essay and support it with facts, examples, or other evidence. However, few tests solely rely on these types of problems, and tend to work in conjunction with other types, such as [[multiple choice]]. Free response questions generally test more than straight [[knowledge]] and ask for a "big picture" type of response ''(see example)''. Also, they usually allow the taker to choose an area in which they are familiar. According to National Council on Measurement in Education, a free-response item is &lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorC&lt;/ref&gt; a test item in which the responders must create a response or product rather than choose a response from a set supplied with the item. A short-answer item, mathematics problem, and writing sample are examples.

Free-response items are distinct from fixed-response items in that examiners must supply a full and independent response. There are no answer options from which to choose. Free-response items are typically discouraged from examinations because of the difficulty, bias, and time effort required in grading them. However, some general guidelines for developing these questions include the following:

The shorter the answer required for a given essay item, generally the better. More objectives can be tested in the same period of time, and factors such as verbal fluency, spelling, etc., have less of an opportunity to influence the grader. 
# Help the examiners focus their answers by giving them a starting sentence for their essay.
# Make sure questions are sharply focused on a single issue. Do not give either the examiner or the grader too much freedom in determining what the answer should be.

Supporters argue that this type of question on tests is that it gives a better indication of the competence and intelligence of the test taker than other more standardized responses, which are claimed to often only measure test-taking ability. However, critics charge that the quality of a free response answer is often determined more by ability with the language in which it is given than competence or intelligence.

==Example==
''(In normal [[Advanced Placement]] [[Advanced Placement exams|exam]] format—illustrates all points)''

Choose two of the following areas and write a well-developed essay in which you analyze change over time and continuities on how technological advances affected the regions between 1914 and 1945:
* [[China]]
* [[United States]]
* [[Soviet Union|Russia (Soviet Union)]]
* [[Middle East]]
''Example thesis from 2007 AP World Student for change over time essay:'' 'Significant cultural ideologies such as [[Communism]] and [[Stalinism]] became the leading factors toward political and cultural change in the Soviet Union throughout 1914-1945. Ultimately, none of these changes were able to improve the standard of living for the working classes of Russia, which ironically had been the goal of the Russian Revolution in the first place.'

[[File:Friedrich Fröbel- Construction kit- 1782-1852- SINA Facsimil-dhub.jpg|thumb|500px|A reproduction set of '''Gifts''']]The '''Froebel gifts''' ({{lang-de|Fröbelgaben}}) are play materials for young children designed by [[Friedrich Fröbel]] for the original [[Kindergarten]] at [[Bad Blankenburg]]. Playing with Froebel gifts, singing, dancing and growing plants were each important aspects of this child-centered approach to education created by [[Friedrich Fröbel]].

The Sonntagsblatt (1838-1840) published by Fröbel explained the meaning, and described the use of each of his five play gifts (Spielgabe):

"The active and creative, living and life producing being of each person, reveals itself in the creative instinct of the child. All human education is bound up in the quiet and conscientious nurture of this instinct of activity; and in the ability of the child, true to this instinct, to be active."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.froebeldecade.com/sonntagsblatt/&lt;/ref&gt;

Between May 1837 and 1850, the Froebel gifts were made in [[Bad Blankenburg]] in the Principality of Schwarzburg Rudolstadt, by master carpenter Löhn, assisted by artisans and women of the village.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.froebeldecade.com/frobel-spur-bad-blankenburg/&lt;/ref&gt;

Fröbel also developed a series of occupations such as sewing, weaving and the modelling with clay, for children to reconstruct their experiences through play.
 
Ottilie de Liagre in a letter to Fröbel in 1844 observed that playing with the Froebel gifts empowers children to be lively and free, but people can degrade it into a mechanical routine.

== The gifts ==
Each of the five gifts was assigned a number by Fröbel in the Sonntagsblatt (1838-1840), which indicates the order in which each gift was to be given to child. 

=== Gift 1 ===
The first gift is a soft ball or yarn ball in solid color, which is the right size for the hand of a small child. When attached to a matching string, the ball can be moved by a mother in various ways as she sings to the child. Although Fröbel sold single balls, they are now usually supplied in sets of six balls consisting of the [[primary color|primary colors]] red, yellow and blue, as well as their [[secondary color|secondary colors]], purple, green and orange.

These soft balls can be squashed in the hand, and they revert to their original shapes.

The first gift was intended by Fröbel to be given to very young children. His intention was that, through holding, dropping, rolling, swinging, hiding and revealing the balls, the child may acquire knowledge of objects and spatial relationships, movement, speed and time, color and contrast, weights and gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gift 2 ===
The second gift originally consisted of two wooden objects, a sphere and a cube.

Fröbel called this gift "the child's delight" since he observed the joy of each child discovering the differences between the sphere and cube.

The child is familiar with the shape of the wooden sphere, which is the same as the ball of the first gift. The wooden sphere always looks the same, when viewed from any direction. Like the child, the wooden sphere is always on the move. When rolled on a hard surface the wooden sphere produces sounds.

In contrast, the wooden cube is the surprise of the second gift. It remains where it is placed and from each direction  presents a different appearance.

The second gift was developed by Fröbel to enable a child to explore and enjoy the differences between shapes. By attaching a string or inserting a rod in a hole drilled through these wooden geometric shapes, they can be spun by a child. Although the sphere always appears the same, the spinning cube reveals many shapes when spun in different ways.

This led Fröbel to include a wooden cylinder in the second gift, which may also be spun in many different ways.

=== Gift 3 ===

The familiar shape of the cube is now divided into eight identical beechwood cubes, about one inch along each edge, which is a convenient size for the hand of small child. A child delights in pulling apart this gift, rearranging the eight cubes in many ways, and then reassembling them in the form of a cube. This is the first building gift.

=== Gift 4 ===
[[File:Fröbels second bullding box.jpg|thumb|Fröbels second bullding box]]
This second building gift at first appears the same. But a surprise awaits the child, when the pieces are pulled apart. Each of these eight identical beechwood blocks is twice as long and half the width of the cubes of the previous gift. Many new possibilities for play and construction arise due to these differences.

=== Gift 5 ===

Considered by many{{by whom|date=May 2018}} too complex for a young child, this building gift consists of more cubes, some of which are divided in halves or quarters.

== Influence ==

In 1850 production was moved to the Erzgebirge region of the Kingdom of Saxony in a factory established for this purpose by S F Fischer.&lt;ref&gt;http://froebelgaben.com/?page_id=53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was given a set of the Froebel blocks at about age nine, and in his autobiography cited them indirectly in explaining that he learned the geometry of architecture in kindergarten play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Froebel gifts were adapted by [[Caroline_Pratt_(educator)|Caroline Pratt]] for the school, which she founded in 1913 in the Greenwich Village of New York City. This school embodied a child-centered approach to education. Children worked together to reconstruct their experiences through play. Based on the ideas of Friedrich Froebel, the curriculum was drawn from the environment of the child: observations about the neighborhood inspired each child to reflect on their world directly so that they could make sense of their experiences.

Froebel gifts continue to be used in [[early childhood education]] in [[Korea]] and [[Japan]], where they are made from local timber.

"Realising how the Gifts were eventually misused by Kindergarten teachers who followed after Froebel, it is important to consider what Froebel expected the Gifts to achieve. He envisaged that the Gifts will teach the child to use his (or her) environment as an educational aid; secondly, that they will give the child an indication of the connection between human life and life in nature; and finally that they will create a bond between the adult and the child who play with them" Joachim Liebschner on page 82 in his book, ''A Child's Work: Freedom and Guidance in Froebel's Educational Theory and Practice''

}}'''George Colby Chase''' (March 15, 1844 - May 27, 1919)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was an American intellectual and professor of English who served as the second [[Lane Hall|President of Bates College]] succeeding its founder, [[Oren Burbank Cheney]], from March 1894 to November 1919. 

Known as "the great builder,"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bates.edu/past-presidents/bates-college-presidents/george-colby-chase/|title=George Colby Chase {{!}} Past Presidents {{!}} Bates College|website=www.bates.edu|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chase constructed 22 new academic buildings and residential dorms on [[Campus of Bates College|the campus of the college]], tripled the number of students and faculty as well as quadrupling the [[financial endowment]] to one million dollars. Chase is notable for being the first and only [[List of Bates College people|alumnus of Bates]] to be elected its president. 

==Life and career==
Chase was born on March 15, 1844 in [[Unity, Maine]]. His parents were [[Free Will Baptist|Freewill Baptists]]. At age 18 Chase enrolled at the [[Maine State Seminary]] and graduated from the Seminary program in 1864. He then enrolled in the college program at [[Bates College]], graduating in 1868. After graduation he taught at the [[New Hampton Literary Institute]], eventually returning to teach at Bates in 1870. In the 1870s, in pursuit his life's work, he returned to Lewiston and enrolled in the theological school, which later became a part of the college's religion department. Meanwhile, the Bates offered him a professorship of Greek and he spent the next year teaching and pursuing his studies in theology. After his spell teaching Greek he moved to teaching English.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In order to better prepare himself, he spent a year as a graduate student at Harvard, returning in 1872 to join the Bates faculty as Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature. Chase attended Bates' [[Cobb Divinity School]] while teaching, but eventually decided not to pursue a career in ministry. Chase then studied at [[Harvard University]], returning to Bates in 1872 to teach Rhetoric and English.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abacus.bates.edu/muskie-archives/EADFindingAids/CA0204.html|title=Guide to the Office of the President, George Colby Chase records, 1868-1921|website=|accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Chase taught for 22 years and during that time his administrative skills were noticed by the current Bates College president, [[Oren Burbank Cheney]]. In the 1880s Chase took on many of the president's fundraising responsibilities, and in 1894, Chase became Bates' second president, when [[Oren Burbank Cheney]] retired. As president Chase greatly expanded the college campus, student body, and the endowment.  Chase served as president until his death in 1919. He died shortly after signing the diplomas for the class of 1919. His house on Frye Street is currently part of College, and Chase Hall is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bates.edu/past-presidents/bates-college-presidents/george-colby-chase/|title=George Colby Chase {{!}} Past Presidents {{!}} Bates College|website=www.bates.edu|accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He has received several honorary degrees including [[University of New Brunswick]] and [[Bowdoin College]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1872, he married Emma F. Millett, a former member of the Bates College's first graduating class. They had five children: George, Emma, Muriel, Elizabeth and Caroline. Chase died at his home in [[Lewiston, Maine]] on May 27, 1919 at the age of 75.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Grooveshark University''' was a free, [[semester]]-long [[Education|program]] offered by [[software engineer]]s at [[Grooveshark.com]] to intermediate [[Computer programmer|programmer]]s at the [[college]] level and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grooveshark offered the initiative to help programmers gain the experience needed to develop their own technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrollment was by application only, and was not limited to college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Grooveshark University was developed to help ease new [[intern]]s into Grooveshark's work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gradually, the program grew into a hub for idea creation, technical learning, and [[prototype]] development, as Grooveshark saw "potential for other ideas developed in Gainesville to grow into full-fledged businesses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grooveshark University was part of an ongoing process to promote innovation in the [[Gainesville, Florida]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|url=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program's mission was to provide an environment where interested developers, young and old, can hone their skills or work with other developers to create new projects and pursue great ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesvillechamber.com/Tech_Entrepreneurs_Give_Back.aspx|url=http://www.gainesvillechamber.com/Tech_Entrepreneurs_Give_Back.aspx|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|url=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classes==
The GSU lectures focused on a variety of different technical topics, including: [[Mobile application development|mobile]] and [[web development]], web standards, and specific [[programming languages]] like [[Python (programming language)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|url=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Weekly sessions were held in the evening&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://grooveshark.com/university|url=http://grooveshark.com/university|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   at Santa Fe College's downtown Center for Innovation and Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meetings typically included [[presentation]]s by Grooveshark developers and group discussions for [[Business networking|networking]] with other programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://grooveshark.com/university|url=http://grooveshark.com/university|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students==
[[Undergraduate]] students, [[Graduate school|graduate]] students, and experienced developers have taken part in Grooveshark University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grooveshark said it looked for individuals "with a lot of raw potential"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wuftfm.org/news/index.php?id=446|url=http://www.wuftfm.org/news/index.php?id=446|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  when choosing participants for the program.

The program is selective. In the first semester, 25 of 50 original applicants were accepted as students, and of that group, fewer than 15 students completed the first semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application process screened for personality as well as skill, and favored candidates who were comfortable working with other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|url=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students of Grooveshark University were encouraged to create their own projects outside of the weekly [[lecture]]s. Graduating students have produced projects such as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="838">'''High master''' is the term used, in place of the more conventional "headmaster",  "head teacher" or "principal", to denote the head teachers of two English independent schools: [[Manchester Grammar School]]&lt;ref&gt;http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1589968_head-of-manchester-grammar-school-quits-to-take-up-job-in-middle-east Manchester Evening News, 28 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St Paul's School, London |St Paul's School]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/about-st-pauls/history St Paul's School website&lt;/ref&gt; in London.

The equivalent '''high mistress''' is used for female headteachers at some independent schools, including [[St Paul's Girls' School]] and [[Abercorn School]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abercornschool.com/index.php/school&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10864">'''Integrative learning''' is a [[Learning theory (education)|learning theory]] describing a movement toward integrated lessons helping students make [[interdisciplinarity|connections across curricula]]. This higher education concept is distinct from the elementary and high school "integrated curriculum" movement.

==Term and concept ==
Integrative Learning comes in many varieties: connecting skills and knowledge from multiple sources and experiences; applying skills and practices in various settings; utilizing diverse and even contradictory points of view; and, understanding issues and positions contextually."

&lt;blockquote&gt;...making connections within a major, between fields, between curriculum, cocurriculum, or between academic knowledge and practice."&lt;ref&gt; Huber, M. T., Hutchings, P., &amp; Gale, R. (2005). ''Integrative Learning for Liberal Education.'' peerReview, Summer/Fall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Integrated studies involve bringing together traditionally separate subjects so that students can grasp a more authentic understanding. Veronica Boix Mansilla, cofounder of the Interdisciplinary Studies Project at Project Zero, explains "when [students] can bring together concepts, methods, or languages from two or more disciplines or established areas of expertise in order to explain a phenomenon, solve a problem, create a product, or raise a new question" they are demonstrating interdisciplinary understanding. For over a decade, Project Zero researchers at the Harvard Graduate School of Education have been studying interdisciplinary work across a range of settings. They have found interdisciplinary understanding to be crucial for modern-thinking students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/integrated-studies-history|title=Integrated Studies: A Short History|first=Suzie|last=Boss|date=6 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edutopia]] highlighted Central York High School as a "School That Works" because of its successful integrated studies approach. For example, an AP government teacher and art teacher collaborated to create a joint project that asked students to create a sculpture based on the principles presented by the AP government class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/integrated-studies-experts|title=Integrated Studies: What Experts Say|date=6 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
AP government teacher Dayna Laur states that,
"Integrated studies projects [aim to] create a connectedness between disciplines that otherwise might seem unrelated to many students. Deliberately searching for ways in which you can mingle standards and content is imperative if you want to create truly authentic experiences because, in the world outside of the classroom, content is not stand-alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/stw-integrated-studies-video-york-high-school-teachers|title=Integrating Art and Politics to Improve High School Student Engagement|first=Mariko|last=Nobori|date=22 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cysd.k12.pa.us/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectionid=6/&amp;url_redirect=1 Central York High School - New High School Homepage 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrated medical curriculum ==
In many American medical schools, an '''integrated curriculum''' refers to a non-compartmentalized approach to basic science learning.  As opposed to traditional medical curriculum, which separate subjects such as [[embryology]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]] and [[anatomy]], '''integrated curricula''' alternate lectures on these subjects over the course of the first two years. (Jonas 1989)  The course of study is instead organized around organ systems (such as "Cardiovascular" or "Gastrointestinal").  Another major component of the integrated medical curriculum is [[problem-based learning]].

==K-12 outcomes==
Interdisciplinary curricula has been shown by several studies to support students’ engagement and learning. Specifically integrating science with reading comprehension and writing lessons has been shown to improve students’ understanding in both science and English language arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://cie.asu.edu/ojs/index.php/cieatasu/article/view/745|title=Improving Student Engagement|first1=Jim|last1=Parsons|first2=Leah|last2=Taylor|date=6 May 2011|publisher=|volume=14|issue=1|via=cie.asu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association for the Study of Forced Migration''' (IASFM) is a professional association for academics and practitioners involved in the field of [[forced migration]].

The IASFM was formed in 1994 to support the International Research and Advisory Panel on Refugees and Other Displaced Persons (IRAP). IRAP had been created in 1990 to provide advice and assistance to the Refugee Studies Programme at the [[University of Oxford]] and its journal the 'Journal of Refugee Studies'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/iasfm/mission.htm |title=Mission of the IASFM|publisher=IASFM|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The IASFM is governed by an International Secretariat. This was initially based at the [[Refugee Studies Centre]], at the University of Oxford. The Secretariat has since moved to the [[Institute for the Study of International Migration]], at [[Georgetown University]] and also receives support from Centre for Refugee Studies at [[York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iasfm.org/about/ |title=About Us - IASFM|publisher=IASFM|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretariat is run by an executive committee headed by the president. The current president is Paula Banerjee.&lt;ref name="officers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iasfm.org/officers/ |title=Officers - IASFM|publisher=IASFM|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6218">The '''International Bioethics Committee''' (IBC) of [[UNESCO]] is a body composed of 36 independent experts from all regions and from different disciplines (mainly medicine, genetics, law, and philosophy) that follows progress in the life sciences and its applications in order to ensure respect for [[human dignity]] and [[human rights]]. It was created in 1993 by Dr Federico Mayor Zaragoza, General Director of UNESCO at that time. It has been prominent in developing Declarations with regard to norms of bioethics that are regarded as [[soft law]] but are nonetheless influential in shaping the deliberations, for example, of research ethics committees (or [[Institutional review board]]) and health policy.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO IBC [http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20091111091254/http://portal.unesco.org/shs/en/ev.php-URL_ID=1879&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html] (last accessed 18 June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allyn Taylor (1999), "Globalization and Biotechnology: UNESCO and an International Strategy to Advance Human Rights and Public Health", ''American Journal of Law and Medicine,'' 25(4), 479-541.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Andorno (2007), "The invaluable role of soft law in the development of universal norms in bioethics", Presentation at the Workshop: The implementation of bioethical principles. A comparative analysis". German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Berlin, 2007 [http://www.unesco.de/1507.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Universal Declaration on Human Genome and Human Rights ==

In 1993, the IBC was entrusted with the task of preparing an international instrument on the human genome, the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights, which was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 1997 and endorsed by the General Assembly of the [[United Nations]] in 1998. The main purpose of this instrument is to protect the human genome from improper manipulations that may endanger the identity and physical integrity of future generations. To this end, it recognizes the human genome as "the heritage of humanity" (Article 1), and declares "contrary to human dignity" practices such as [[human cloning]] (Article 11) and germ-line interventions (Article 24). In addition, the Declaration intends to prevent genetic reductionism, [[genetic discrimination]], and any use of genetic information that would be contrary to [[human dignity]] and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13177&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights |author=UNESCO |date=11 November 1997 |accessdate=29 Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noelle Lenoir (1997), "UNESCO, Genetics and Human Rights", ''Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal,'' 7, 31-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shawn Harmon (2005), "The Significance of UNESCO’s Universal Declaration on the Human Genome &amp; Human Rights", ''Script-ed.

== International Declaration on Human Genetic Data ==

In 2003, the IBC issued a second global instrument, the International Declaration on Human Genetic Data, which may be regarded as an extension of the 1997 Declaration. This document sets out a number of rules for the collection, use and storage of human genetic data. It covers, among other issues, informed consent in genetics; confidentiality of genetic data; [[genetic discrimination]]; anonymization of personal genetic information; population-based genetic studies; the right not to know one’s genetic make up; genetic counselling; international solidarity in genetic research, and benefit sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17720&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=International Declaration on Human Genetic Data |author=UNESCO |date=16 October 2003 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights ==

The last global instrument drafted by the IBC is the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, which has a much broader scope than the two previous documents. It aims to provide a comprehensive framework of principles that should guide biomedical activities, in order to ensure that they are in conformity with international human rights law.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Andorno (2007), "Global bioethics at UNESCO: in defence of the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights", ''Journal of Medical Ethics,'' 33, 150-154. [https://uzh.academia.edu/RobertoAndorno/Papers/444663/Global_Bioethics_at_UNESCO_In_Defence_of_the_Universal_Declaration_on_Bioethics_and_Human_Rights] &lt;/ref&gt; The academic [[Thomas Alured Faunce]] has analysed this Declaration's non-binding [[social responsibility]], [[technology transfer]] and transnational benefit principles which expressly apply to private and public [[corporations]] as well as [[Sovereign state|states]].&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA and Nasu H.

The '''International Four-H Youth Exchange''', or '''IFYE''' was an international exchange program supported and funded by the National [[4-H]] Council up until 1992. In 1999 continued support and funding for the program was, "accepted," by the IFYE Association, and in 2012 IFYE officially changed its name to the, "IFYE Association of the USA, Inc."&lt;ref&gt;http://ifyeusa.org/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|4-H}}
At the end of [[World War II]], 4-H teens attending a national 4-H conference asked themselves, "Why can't we solve our problems in a more humane way?" Thus, a two-way cultural exchange known as the International Farm Youth Exchange began in 1948 conducted by the National 4-H Council.

[[Gertrude L. Warren]], of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], contributed organization and leadership.&lt;ref name="joyce"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Joyce |first1=Maureen |title=Gertrude Warren Dies: 'Mother of 4-H' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1979/09/08/gertrude-warren-dies-mother-of-4-h/00de39ab-22fe-4186-a076-aeaf99286365/ |accessdate=6 August 2018 |work=Washington Post |date=8 September 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the National IFYE Association (composed of exchange alumni and others interested in promoting the International 4-H Exchanges) accepted the responsibilities to support the continued funding of these programs.  Thus, the National IFYE Foundation was developed in 1996-97 with a Board of Directors and officers named in 1997. Recommendations for directors were received by the established regions of the IFYE Association at its annual conference in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1996. The first annual meeting of the board was held in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] on July 23, 1997.

Because of the IFYE, thousands of young people from all over the world have lived and worked on farms, small towns and cities of another country, sharing these one-in-a-lifetime experiences with thousands of people.

==Mission==
The International Four-H Youth Exchange (IFYE) Association of the USA, Inc., in cooperation with the Cooperative Extension System, will
*promote world peace through exchange opportunities for mutual understanding,
*support and perpetuate the growth of 4-H International education and exchange programs,
*provide support to returning international exchange participants,
*provide financial assistance for exchanges through its affiliated IFYE Foundation of the USA,
*provide recognition to groups and individuals who further global awareness and inter-cultural understanding, and
*establish a network to further international understanding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3241">'''Karl Scheidemantel''' (29 January 1859 – 26 June 1923) was a [[baritone]] singer, and later an opera director.

[[File:Scheidemantel Brustbild jung.jpg|thumb|Karl Scheidemantel]]

==Life and career==
Born in [[Weimar]], the son of a Weimar court artist, Scheidemantel found great success in various roles in the operas of [[Richard Wagner]]. Among his supporters were Bodo Borchers in Weimar, well known voice teacher [[Julius Stockhausen]] in Frankfurt, and composer [[Franz Liszt]]. At the age of 25 he joined the ensemble of the [[Semperoper|Dresden Hofoper]] where he was named [[Kammersänger]], "Chamber Singer to the Saxon Grand Duke" in 1884. He sang at the 1886, 1888, 1891, and 1892 [[Bayreuth festival]]s. He frequently corresponded with [[Cosima Wagner]] about the happenings of the stage. He then sang at most of the great European opera houses, especially the Vienna State Opera, where in April and May 1890 he sang the rolls of Heiling, Renato, Zampa, Wolfram, Luna and, Sachs. He was a guest singer at La Scala in 1892. His closest friend was singer Karl Perron. He married Hedwig Lehnert in June 1897 at the Dresden Annankirche. His final career appearance was on 8 June 1911 as Hans Sachs.

Scheidemantel sang over 170 roles in his career. Notably, he created the role of ''Herr von Faninal'' in [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' in 1911. His German singing translation of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' was widely used. It was first used in his own new production at Dresden in June 1914, in which [[Richard Tauber]] first sang Don Ottavio. He also edited a song anthology for music publisher Eulenberg.

After his stage career he returned to Weimar where he taught singing. His students included [[Hermann Uhde]] and [[Herbert Heyner]]. He returned to Dresden as director of the Dresden Opera in from 1920-1922. Scheidemantel is buried in Dresden-Tolkewitz. Dresden named a road in his honor.

'''''København''''' was a Danish five-masted [[barque]] used as a naval training vessel until its disappearance after December 22, 1928. Built for the Danish [[East Asiatic Company]] in 1921, it was the world's largest [[sailing ship]] at the time, and primarily served for [[sail training]] of young cadets.

The ''København'' was last heard from on December 21, 1928 while en route from [[Buenos Aires]] to Australia. When it became clear the ship was missing, a lengthy search ensued, but turned up no trace. The disappearance has become one of the greatest maritime mysteries of the modern era, and led to much speculation about the ship's ultimate fate.

==Description==
The ''København'' was built by the firm of [[Ramage &amp; Ferguson]] at [[Leith]] in Scotland (number 256), begun in 1913 but not completed until March 24, 1921. It was constructed for the Danish [[East Asiatic Company]] as a [[sail training]] ship. Known as the "Big Dane", it was the largest [[sailing ship]] in the world when completed. It was 430 feet (131 metres) long and grossed 3,965 tons; its five masts stood nearly 20 stories high with sails spanning a total of 56,000 square feet (5,202 square metres). It had an auxiliary diesel motor as well as a wireless transmitter. The [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] was a carving of a helmeted Bishop [[Absalon]].&lt;ref name=Mooney&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Mooney |first1= Michael J. |year= 1993 |title= Last Call at Buenos Aires: Disappearance of the Danish ship København |journal= Americas |volume= 45 |issue= 6 |pages= 38–44|publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily intended for training young cadets seeking an officer's license, the ship offset some of its costs by carrying limited amounts of cargo on its voyages. Baron Nils Juel-Brockdorff oversaw the ship's construction and subsequently served as its first captain. From 1921 to 1928 the ship made nine voyages, visiting nearly every continent and completing two [[circumnavigation]]s.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt;

==Disappearance==
On September 21, 1928, the ''København'' departed from [[Nørresundby]] in [[Northern Jutland]] for [[Buenos Aires]] on its tenth, and ultimately final, voyage. The captain was Hans Andersen; 75 persons were aboard, including 26 crew and 45 [[cadet]]s. The goal was to unload a shipload of chalk and bagged cement in Buenos Aires, take on another load of cargo and sail for [[Melbourne]], and then bring a shipment of Australian wheat back to Europe.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt;&lt;ref name=wrecksite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?58328|title=København (+1928)|accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Porterfield&gt;{{cite news |title= Phantom Ships–The Ghosts That Sail the Seven Seas|first= Walden R. |last= Porterfield |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5S8gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ygEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7451,3307580&amp;dq=københavn+five-masted+ghost-ship&amp;hl=en |newspaper= [[Milwaukee Journal]] |date= May 30, 1973 |accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''København'' arrived at Buenos Aires on November 17, 1928, impressing the locals, in particular emigrant Danes. The cargo was unloaded; however, the departure was delayed as there were no paying commissions to take the cargo to Australia. Finally, on December 14, Captain Andersen decided to ship out to Australia without a cargo. The voyage was expected to take 45 days. On December 22 the ''København'' exchanged radio messages with the Norwegian steamer ''William Blumer'', indicating they were about 900 miles from [[Tristan da Cunha]] and that "all is well". The ''Blumer'' attempted to contact the ''København'' again later that night, to no avail. The ship was never heard from again.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porterfield"/&gt;

==Search and legacy==
Due to the length of the voyage to Australia, and the fact that Andersen routinely went long periods without sending a message, the Danish were not initially worried. However, concern mounted as months passed without word. In April 1929 the Danish East Asiatic Company dispatched a [[motor vessel]], the ''Mexico'', to Tristan da Cunha. Residents reported having seen a large five-masted ship with its [[foremast]] broken on January 21, 1929; however, it had not attempted to land on the island. The ''Mexico'', joined by the British [[Royal Navy]], searched for the ''København'' for several months, but found no sign of it. The Danish government officially declared the ship and its crew were lost at sea.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt;&lt;ref name=Porterfield/&gt;

A number of theories for the ''København'''s disappearance have been advanced. The most commonly accepted is that the ship struck an [[iceberg]] in the dark or fog. If so, the ship may have sunk too quickly for the crew to react. The lack of wreckage found later may have been the result of the ship's particularly secure loading and rigging, a necessity against the strong winds known as the [[Roaring Forties]]. An alternate theory is that the ship, which was in ballast with no cargo, may have been capsized by heavy winds, disabling the lifeboats for survivors.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt;

For the next two years after the ''København'''s disappearance there were a number of sightings of a mysterious five-masted ship fitting its description in the Pacific, fueling further speculation about the vessel. Early reports came from Chilean fishermen, then in July 1930, the crew of an Argentine freighter sighted a five-masted "[[ghost ship|phantom ship]]" during a gale. The captain took their statements and wondered if this was the "wraith of the Copenhagen". Further sightings came in the following weeks from [[Easter Island]] and the Peruvian coast. Later some wreckage, including a piece of stern bearing the name "København", reportedly was found off [[West Australia]].&lt;ref name=Porterfield/&gt;

Tentative evidence for the ship continued to emerge. In 1934 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a ''København'' cadet's diary had been found [[message in a bottle|in a bottle]] on [[Bouvet Island]] in the [[South Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Log' in Bottle Says Icebergs Crushed Missing Training Ship |author=Carlos J. Videla |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1934/09/16/archives/-log-in-bottle-says-icebergs-crushed-missing-training-ship-fate-of-.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=16 September 1934 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supposed diary indicated that the ship had been destroyed by icebergs and abandoned, the crew taking their chances in lifeboats.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt; In 1935, human remains and the remains of a lifeboat were found partly buried in the sand along the southwest coast of [[Africa]]. These may have come from ''København''.&lt;ref name=wrecksite/&gt;

}}'''Mova Nanova''' ({{lang-be|Мова Нанова}}, ''Mova Nanova'', literally, “language anew”) is a Belarusian course that has taken place in [[Minsk]], the capital of [[Belarus]], since January 13, 2014. It is a non-profit NGO, a cultural and linguistic initiative aimed at expanding the everyday use of the [[Belarusian language]], which alongside Russian is one of the two official languages of Belarus. The lessons are held in the gallery of modern art «Ў». The initiative has caught on and has been acclaimed by other regional cities that support the endeavour locally – now the courses can be also found in [[Baranovichi|Baranavičy]], [[Grodno|Hrodna]], [[Babruysk|Babrujsk]], [[Nesvizh|Niasviž]], [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], [[Maladzyechna|Maladziečna]], [[Mogilev|Mahilioŭ]], [[Vitebsk|Viciebsk]] and [[Gomel|Homel]].&lt;ref name="racyja"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racyja.com/index.php?id=103&amp;zoom=22691#.U0blsaKdBLs|title=Беларускае Радыё РАЦЫЯ - КУЛЬТУРА - "Мова нанова" пашырае геаграфію|publisher=racyja.com|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undertaking has also expanded outside Belarus and has an affiliate group in Kraków.&lt;ref name="bialoruskie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bialoruskie.org/?pl_mova-nanova-w-krakowie,97|title=MOVA NANOVA w Krakowie - Towarzystwo Białoruskie w Krakowie|publisher=bialoruskie.org|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mova Nanova in Minsk has been set up and is hosted by Alesia Litvinouskaja, a linguist, and Gleb Labadzenka, a journalist.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.tut.by/culture/382290.html|title=Шчодры вечар: з аншлагам пачаўся новы сезон курсаў беларускай мовы "Мова нанова"|publisher=news.tut.by|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course gathers about 300 students weekly and is attended by people of different background and all walks of life from Belarusian-speaking physicians and software engineers to architects and singers, to writers and actors, to historians and students, to kids and senior citizens. The distinct feature and integral part of each class is special guests.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaFPuO8y6Q|title=YouTube - Лявон Вольскі -- Тры чарапахі -- Мова Нанова 07.04.2014|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, they are public figures and famous people promoting the Belarusian language and culture, and who see this linguistic environment as an intrinsic part of their daily life.

The course is informal by nature, and the teaching process is not governed by strict academic rules. The lessons are divided into different topics like fashion, medicine, relatives, etc., and are split up into several sections – vocabulary, grammar, interesting facts, historical or cultural edutainment section, and more.

==Awards==

In June, 2014 Mova Nanova was awarded the Grand Prix for the best project in the "Undertakings of Social Value" category at AD!NAK,&lt;ref name="adnak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adnak.by/navini/508-per3#scroll|title=Фестываль беларускамоўнай рэкламы і камунікацыі|publisher=adnak.by|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tut.by news"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.tut.by/society/404654.html|title=Камасутра, кіроўцы з жалезнымі яйцамі і палітвязні.

The most common instances are website texts, name plates, posters and billboards, names of ingredients on packages, labels and price tags in shops, restaurant menus, advertisements, etc.

The first national sports contest Mova Cup (Language Cup) took place on September 28, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svaboda.mobi/a/nova-cup-festival/26610233.html Cпартова-моўны фэстываль «Мова Cup»] — артыкул на сайце svaboda.mobi&lt;/ref&gt; where there was also a team representing Mova Nanova, which came 5th in the overall standing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mst.by/ru/press-centre/actual/padvedzeny-vynk-spartynaga-festyvalju-mova-cup_i_6633.html Падведзены вынікі спартыўнага фестывалю "Мова Cup"] — артыкул на сайце mst.by&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise for emergence==
The initiative has emerged as a response to the growing need of a certain part of Belarusian population inclined to raise their linguistic, cultural and national awareness, and among those people who are interested in building up their knowledge of the Belarusian language. The regular attendees of the course see this practice as an inseparable step toward strengthening their national identity. Currently regardless of the official status of Belarusian as one of the state languages, its use is mainly restricted to academic and scientific circles, and a range of media channels. Whereas Russian remains the dominant language in public life, among official authorities and on the governmental level as well as in the sphere of education, where the use of Belarusian is equivalent to that of a foreign language.

According to the latest census of 2009, around 53% of the population of Belarus consider the Belarusian language to be their mother tongue, however, only about 23% of the respondents say they speak it at home.&lt;ref name="belstat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belstat.gov.by/homep/en/census/2009/pc_results.php|title=Population Census 2009|publisher=belstat.gov.by|accessdate=2014-04-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129071305/belstat.gov.by/homep/en/census/2009/pc_results.php|archivedate=2012-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The language is labelled as vulnerable by UNESCO, which is reflected on its Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap.html|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|publisher=unesco.org|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being brought up in a predominantly Russian linguistic environment, many Belarusian people still experience linguistic interference when they try to speak Belarusian and find it difficult to switch to this language and achieve fluency in an everyday conversation. One of the common reasons that impedes wider adoption of Belarusian beyond the passive utilization in reading and listening is said to be lack of confidence about the level of proficiency that in fluent speech often results in a mixture of both Russian and Belarusian. This blend is often informally called “[[trasianka]]”. Therefore, one of the primary aims of the Mova Nanova course is to help those who are aspiring to speak Belarusian regain and develop confidence about using the language in a daily conversation, refresh their existing knowledge, and instill curiosity about further learning of the Belarusian language, culture and history.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/28/-sp-russian-belarus-reclaims-language-belarusian|title=After Decades of Russian Dominance, Belarus Begins to Reclaim its Language|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Babrujsk===
Alesia Litvinouskaja and Gleb Labadzenka handed the baton to the like-minded fellow activists from Babrujsk on February 21, 2014, [[International Mother Language Day]].&lt;ref name="euroradio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euroradio.by/u-babruysku-adkrylisya-kursy-mova-nanova-fota|title=У Бабруйску адкрыліся курсы "Мова нанова" (фота) &amp;#124; Новости Беларуси от Euroradio.fm|publisher=euroradio.by|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="belsat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belsat.eu/be/wiadomosci/a,18059,mova-nanova-i-mova-tsi-kava-iduts-u-reghiiony.html|title=Белсат ТВ - Навіны - "Мова нанова" і "Мова ці кава" ідуць у рэгіёны|publisher=belsat.eu|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mova Nanova in the biggest regional city is hosted by the linguist Volha Rudaja and the journalist Alesia Lacinskaja. The course takes place at 33/1 Kastryčnickaja Street each Friday at 18:00. Alesia Litvinouskaja and Gleb Labadzenka, the founders of Mova Nanova in Minsk, came to open the course in Babrujsk and held the first lesson. There were 20 attendees. The topic was [[greeting]]s and [[forms of address]]. The students discussed the original Belarusian names, and the vocabulary on the topic “Relatives” was introduced. Then there was reading of several articles from ''[[Nasha Niva|Naša Niva]]'' (one of the oldest Belarusian periodicals), dated to the early 20th century. The lesson was concluded with a creative task that required the attendees to finish famous Belarusian proverbs and sayings in their own way.

The event was supported by the organizers of the civil campaign “Budzma Belarusami”. The students received Budzma-branded souvenirs and books from the Union of Belarusian writers.

===Hrodna===
The introductory presentation of the first lesson in Hrodna on March 14, 2014, gathered more than 100 people.&lt;ref name="belport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belport.by/index.php?newsid=116956|title=На першы занятак "Мова нанова" ў Гродне прыйшло больш за 100 чалавек|publisher=belport.by|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was organized with the help of the civil organization “Centre of “The Third Sector””. 15&amp;nbsp;minutes before the planned start it was clear that the spot wouldn’t have enough room to welcome all the guests willing to attend the course. The organizers had to promptly find another venue for the presentation and postpone the beginning of the lesson by half an hour. There were people of different background among the first attendees, including the students of “The University of the Golden Age”, and college students as well as middle-aged people. The presentation was delivered again by the founders of the course “Mova Nanova” Gleb Labadzenka and Alesia Litvinouskaja. Alesia immediately won the hearts of the audience by saying that she was the granddaughter of the renowned Apanas Cychun. While the rest of the students enthusiastically responded to the zeal and witty jokes of Gleb. From the beginning of the presentation the hosts set laid-back and friendly atmosphere that lasted during the two hours of the lesson.

The founders of Mova Nanova spoke about the key concept of these courses and demonstrated a few examples of lessons that could be used as the building blocks for the course in the affiliate group in Hrodna. Then a practical followed. The students were divided into groups and again had to finish Belarusian proverbs and sayings. At the end of the presentation the hosts of Mova Nanova in Hrodna were introduced to the audience. The initiative will be carried on by Volha Astroŭskaja and Ihar Kuzminič.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74209">'''Organizational learning''' is the process of creating, retaining, and transferring knowledge within an organization. An organization improves over time as it gains experience. From this experience, it is able to create knowledge. This knowledge is broad, covering any topic that could better an organization. Examples may include ways to increase production efficiency or to develop beneficial investor relations. Knowledge is created at four different units: individual, group, organizational, and inter organizational.

The most common way to measure organizational learning is a [[learning curve]]. Learning curves are a relationship showing how as an organization produces more of a product or service, it increases its productivity, efficiency, reliability and/or quality of production with diminishing returns. [[Learning curve]]s vary due to organizational learning rates. Organizational learning rates are affected by individual proficiency, improvements in an organization's technology, and improvements in the structures, routines and methods of coordination.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Organizational Learning - Springer|url = https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4614-5251-5|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4614-5251-5|first = Linda|last = Argote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance ==
Organizational learning happens as a function of [[experience]] within an [[organization]] and allows the organization to stay competitive in an ever-changing environment. Organizational learning is a process improvement that can increase efficiency, accuracy, and profits. A real-world example of organizational learning is how a new pizza store will reduce the cost per pizza as the cumulative production of pizzas increases.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; As the staff creates more pizza; they begin to make pizzas faster, the staff learns how to work together, and the equipment is placed in the most efficient location leading to cheaper costs of creation. An example of a more formal way to track and support organizational learning is a [[learning agenda]].

Organizational learning is an aspect of [[organizations]] and a subfield of [[organizational studies]]. As an aspect of an organization, organizational learning is the process of creating, retaining, and transferring knowledge. [[Knowledge]] creation, knowledge retention, and [[knowledge transfer]] can be seen as adaptive processes that are functions of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Cyert, Richard; March, James G. (1992). A Behavioral Theory of the Firm (2 ed.). Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|0-631-17451-6}}. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Experience]] is the knowledge that contributes to the procedural understanding of a subject through involvement or exposure. Research within organizational learning specifically applies to the attributes and behavior of this knowledge and how it can produce changes in the [[cognition]], [[Business process|routines]], and [[behaviors]] of an [[organization]] and its individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Easterby-Smith | first1 = M | last2 = Crossan | first2 = M | last3 = Niccolini | first3 = D | year = 2000 | title = Organizational learning: Debates past, present andfuture | url = | journal = Journal of Management Studies | volume = 37 | issue = 6| pages = 783–796 | doi=10.1111/1467-6486.00203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals are predominantly seen as the functional mechanisms for organizational learning by creating knowledge through experience.&lt;ref name="Argote Book5" /&gt; However, individuals' knowledge only facilitates learning within the organization as a whole if it is transferred. Individuals may withhold their knowledge or exit the organization. Knowledge that is embedded into the organization, in addition to its individuals, can be retained.&lt;ref name="Argote 20113" /&gt; Organizations can retain knowledge in other ways than just retaining individuals, including using knowledge repositories such as communication tools, processes, [[learning agenda]]s, routines, networks, and [[transactive memory]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Argote | first1 = L | last2 = Ingram | first2 = P | year = 2000 | title = Knowledge transfer: A basis for competitive advantage in firms | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 82 | issue = 1| pages = 150–169 | doi=10.1006/obhd.2000.2893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walsh | first1 = JP | last2 = Ungson | first2 = GR | year = 1991 | title = Organizational memory | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 57–91 | doi=10.5465/amr.1991.4278992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a subfield, organizational learning is the study of experience, knowledge, and the effects of knowledge within an organizational context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fiol | first1 = M.C. | last2 = Lyles | first2 = M.A. | year = 1985 | title = Organizational learning | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 803–13 | doi=10.5465/amr.1985.4279103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of organizational learning directly contributes to the applied science of [[knowledge management]] (KM) and the concept of the [[learning organization]]. Organizational learning is related to the studies of [[organizational theory]], [[organizational communication]], [[organizational behavior]], [[organizational psychology]], and [[organizational development]]. Organizational learning has received contributions from the fields of [[educational psychology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]], [[political science]], and [[management science]].&lt;ref&gt;[[b:Learning Theories/Organizational Learning: Contributions by Discipline|Wikibooks:Learning Theories/Organizational Learning: Contributions by Discipline]] Wikibooks on Learning Theories and Organizational Learning&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communities of learning ===
Organizations gain knowledge in one of the four organizational communities of [[learning]]: individual, team, organizational, and inter-organizational. Organizational learning "involves the process through which organizational communities (e.g. groups, departments, divisions) change as a result of experience." An example of organizational learning is a hospital surgical team learning to use new technology that will increase efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Argote, Linda. "Intraorganizational Learning." UNC Classes. UNC. Web. 11 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Individual learning''' is the smallest community at which learning can occur. An individual learns new skills or ideas, and their productivity at work may increase as they gain expertise. The individual can decide whether or not to share their knowledge with the rest of the group. If the individual leaves the group and doesn't share their knowledge before leaving, the group loses this knowledge.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Jeanne M. 20073"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Jeanne M. | authorlink2 = Paul S. Goodman | last2 = Goodman | first2 = Paul S. | last3 = Cronin | first3 = Matthew A. | year = 2007 | title = Group Learning | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 32 | issue = 4| pages = 1041–59 | doi=10.5465/amr.2007.26585724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their study of software development, Boh, Slaughter and Espinosa (2007) found that individuals were more productive the more specialized experience they had with a certain system.&lt;ref name="Argote Spektor4" /&gt;
* '''Group learning''' is the next largest community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wenger |first1=Etienne |title=Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity |date=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}Argote, L., Gruenfeld, D., and Naquin, C. "Group learning in organizations."
Groups at Work: Advances in Theory and Research, ed., M. E. Turner
(Lawrence Erlbaum, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; There are conflicting definitions of group learning among researchers studying it. One belief is that group learning is a process in which a group takes action, gets feedback, and uses this feedback to modify their future action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sole | first1 = D. | last2 = Edmondson | first2 = A. C. | year = 2002 | title = Situated knowledge and learning in dispersed teams | url = | journal = British Journal of Management | volume = 13 | issue = S2 | pages = S17–S34 | doi=10.1111/1467-8551.13.s2.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another belief is that group learning happens when a member shares their individual knowledge with other group members. Others have suggested that group learning is primarily a process of error detection and correction&lt;ref&gt;Argyris,C. and Schön, D. Organizational Learning: Theory, method and practice.(New York: Addison-Wesley, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; or that group learning is a primarily about the processes of interpretation and integration.&lt;ref&gt;Crossan,M.M, Lane, H.W. and White, R.E.(1999), An organizational learning framework: From learning to institution. Academy of Management Review, 24: 522-537&lt;/ref&gt; Once this happens, individual learning turns into group learning.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Jeanne M. 20073" /&gt; Reagans, Argote, and Brooks (2005) studied group learning by examining joint-replacement surgery in teaching hospitals. They concluded that "increased experience working together in a team promoted better coordination and teamwork."&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, A.C., J.R. Dillon, and K.S. Roloff (2007). Three perspectives on team learning: Outcome improvement, task mastery, and group process. In A. Brief and J. Walsh (Eds.), The Academy of Management Annals, Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Working together in a team also allowed members to share their knowledge with others and learn from other members. To sum up the different definitions cover following aspects: task independence (what one group member does affects and is affected by another group member); social psychological awareness (members perceive themselves as a group and are perceived as a group); and social embeddedness (the group exists in a larger social system).&lt;ref&gt;Argote, L., (2013). Organizational Learning:Creating, Retaining and transferring knowledge, Springer Science + Business Media New York, 115-146&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Organizational learning''' is the way in which an organization creates and organizes knowledge relating to their functions and culture. Organizational learning happens in all of the organization's activities, and it happens in different speeds. The goal of organizational learning is to successfully adapt to changing environments, to adjust under uncertain conditions, and to increase efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dodgson | first1 = Mark | year = 1993 | title = Organizational learning: a review of some literatures | url = | journal = Organization Studies | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 375–394 | doi=10.1177/017084069301400303}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Argote (1993), managers in manufacturing plants saw organization learning occur when they found ways to make individual workers more proficient, improve the organization's "technology, tooling, and layout," improve the organization's structure, and determine the organization's strengths.&lt;ref name="Argote Book5" /&gt;
* '''Interorganizational learning''' is the way in which different organizations in an alliance collaborate, share knowledge, and learn from one another. An organization is able to improve its "processes and products by integrating new insights and knowledge" from another organization.&lt;ref name="Tucker, Anita L. 20073"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tucker | first1 = Anita L. | last2 = Nembhard | first2 = Ingrid M. | last3 = Edmondson | first3 = Amy C. | year = 2007 | title = Implementing new practices: an empirical study of organizational learning in hospital intensive care units | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 53 | issue = 6| pages = 894–907 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.1060.0692}}&lt;/ref&gt; By learning from another organization, an organization is able to cut time costs, decrease the risks associated with problem solving, and learn faster. Learning from another organization can mean either applying the same ideas used by that organization or modifying these ideas, thereby creating innovation.&lt;ref name="Tucker, Anita L. 20073" /&gt; Inter-organizational learning occurs frequently in fixed business models, such as franchising. The franchisee looking to use the franchisor's brand has to learn how to use the organization's business model before starting a franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hjalager | first1 = Anne-Mette | year = 1999 | title = Interorganizational Learning Systems | url = | journal = Human Systems Management | volume = 18 | issue = 1| page = 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of study ===
The origin of the focused study of organizational learning can be traced to the late 1970s, when researchers studied it from a psychological viewpoint. Key advances in the field include:
* '''Behavioral psychology and organizational development''': In their 1978 work on organizational learning, [[Chris Argyris]] and [[Donald Schön]] developed the concepts of single-loop and double-loop learning.&lt;ref&gt;Argyris, C. and Schön, D.A. (1978), ''Organizational Learning: A Theory of Action Perspective'', Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Single-loop learning is the process in which a mistake is corrected by using a different strategy or method that is expected to yield a different, successful outcome. Take, for example, a person who acts a certain way to accomplish a certain goal. If this person's actions fail in accomplishing the goal, with single-loop learning, this person will reflect on their previous actions and, going forward, they will take a different set of actions to accomplish the same goal. Double-loop learning, on the other hand, is a more complicated process in which a mistake is corrected by rethinking the initial goal. In the previous example, the person would show double-loop learning if they chose to reevaluate their goal and beliefs instead of simply reassessing their failed actions. They will then take a set of actions that are aligned with their reevaluated goals and beliefs. Argyris and Schön explain that both single-loop and double-loop learning processes are present in organizations and are two types of organizational learning. Single-loop learning occurs when an organization detects a mistake, corrects it, and carries on with its present policies and objectives. Double-loop learning occurs when an organization detects a mistake and changes its policies and objectives before it can take corrective actions.&lt;ref&gt;YMCA George Williams College. "Chris Argyris: Theories of Action, Double-Loop Learning, and Organizational Learning." Infed. Infed.org. 30 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romero Pereda, Arturo. "Single-Loop and Double-Loop Learning Model." ICL Blog. AFS Intercultural Programs. Web. 30 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Adaptation and routines''': In their book defining the [[behavioral theory of the firm]], [[Richard Cyert]] and [[James G. March]] described organizational learning as an organization's adaptive behavior over time. This consists of the adaptation of goals, adaptation in attention rules, and adaptation in search rules. Part of organizational learning is setting goals and changing these goals over time. They change along with an organization's members are established as problems arise.{{clarify|date=November 2015}} When setting goals, an organization should consider three variables: "the organization's past goal, the organization's past performance, and the past performance of other 'comparable' organizations."&lt;ref name="Cyert, Richard M. 19643"&gt;Cyert, Richard M., and James G. March. A Behavioral Theory of the Firm. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting an organization's attention rules consists of determining which parts of an organization's environment requires most attention. Cyert and March give the example of the criteria an organization uses to evaluate employees' performances. Over time, organizations learn which criteria to use for their evaluations and how much weight to assign to each criterion. They also use the example of selecting which criteria to use when comparing one's organization with a similar one. An organization's adaptation in search rules refers to its ability to find solutions for its problems. Since a solution depends on the problem, an organization's search rules will change accordingly. Typically, an organization will be more likely to search for a solution a certain way if this search method previously succeeded in finding a solution. An organization's search rules will depend on its previous successes or failures with the alternative search rules.&lt;ref name="Cyert, Richard M. 19643" /&gt;
* '''Learning curves''' by Dutton &amp; Thomas (1984): John M. Dutton and Annie Thomas organized field studies on various industries to study the rates of learning in organizations. They found that workers' errors and/or costs decrease as they learn from experience. However, since the knowledge that workers' can learn lessens over time, they cannot improve their performance at a constant rate. Instead, the rate by which they improve decreases with more experience. Dutton and Thomas also found that there are four causal categories that affect a firm's progress. Two categories, exogenous and endogenous learning, describe the source of a firm's progress. Exogenous learning occurs when a firm acquires information from external sources that allow it to progress. Examples of external sources include "suppliers, customers, competitors, and government."&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutton | first1 = John M | year = 1984 | title = Treating Progress Functions as a Managerial Opportunity | url = | journal = The Academy of Management Review | volume = 9 | issue = 2| page = 241 | jstor=258437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endogenous learning occurs when employees learn from within the firm, which is "manifested by technical changes, direct-labor learning, and smoothing production flows."&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; The other two categories, induced and autonomous learning, describe the environments in which progress occurs. Induced learning occurs when a firm makes investments or adds resources to an environment to make it conducive for learning. Autonomous learning occurs when sustained production leads to automatic improvements over long periods of time.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

== Knowledge ==
[[Knowledge]] is an indicator of organizational learning. Organization learning happens when there is a change in the knowledge of an organization.&lt;ref name="Argote Spektor4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Argote | first1 = Linda | last2 = Miron-Spektor | first2 = Ella | year = 2011 | title = Organizational learning: from experience to knowledge | url = | journal = Organization Science | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 1123–1137 | doi=10.1287/orsc.1100.0621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers measure organizational knowledge in various ways. For example, some researchers assess knowledge as changes in an organization's practices or routines that increase efficiency.&lt;ref name="Gherardi, Silvia 20052"&gt;Gherardi, Silvia. Organizational Knowledge: The Texture of Workplace Learning. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers base it on the number of patents an organization has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alcacer | first1 = Juan | last2 = Gittelman | first2 = Michelle | last3 = Sampat | first3 = Bhaven | year = 2009 | title = Applicant and Examiner Citations in U.S. Patents: An Overview and Analysis | url = | journal = Research Policy | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 415–427 | doi=10.1016/j.respol.2008.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knowledge management]] is the process of collecting, developing, and spreading knowledge assets to enable organizational learning.

=== Nature of knowledge ===
[[Knowledge]] is not a homogenous resource. Although it is related to data and information, knowledge is different from these constructs. Data are a set of defined, objective facts concerning events, while information is a value-added form of data that adds meaning through contextualization, categorization, calculation, correction, or condensation.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, T. H.; Prusak, L. (2000). Working knowledge. Boston: Harvard Business School Press (Chapter 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge is the applied version of information, a combination of information within experience, framing, value, contextualization, and insight. Experience is knowledge that is generated through exposure to and application of knowledge. Knowledge originates within and is applied by units of an organization to evaluate and utilize experience and information effectively. Knowledge can become embedded within repositories, routines, processes, practices, tools, and norms, depending on the relationship between information, experience, and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Organizational learning research: Past, present and future|url = http://mlq.sagepub.com/content/42/4/439|journal = Management Learning|date = 2011-09-01|issn = 1350-5076|pages = 439–446|volume = 42|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/1350507611408217|first = Linda|last = Argote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two distinct forms of knowledge, explicit and tacit, are significant in this respect. Explicit knowledge is codified, systematic, formal, and easy to communicate. Tacit knowledge is personal, context-specific, subjective knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Nonaka, I., H. Takeuchi. 1995. The Knowledge Creating Company. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Explicit knowledge]] is knowledge that is easy to transfer. Unlike tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge is declarative or factual.  It is transferred through written, verbal, or codified media. Examples of this include instructions, definitions, and documents. Among its employees, Toyota spreads explicit knowledge about its assembly line production. Toyota requires each team of workers and each individual worker to document their tasks, providing detailed descriptions on "how each task is to be performed, how long each task should take, the sequence of steps to be followed in performing each task, and the steps to be taken by each worker in checking his or her own work." This uses explicit knowledge since the knowledge is passed along using a code, which is a document of detailed descriptions in Toyota's case.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA3"&gt;Sanchez, Ron. "'Tacit Knowledge' versus 'Explicit Knowledge' Approaches to Knowledge Management Practice." IVS/CVS Working Papers 2004-01, Department of Industrial Economics and Strategy, Copenhagen Business School.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tacit knowledge]] is knowledge that is difficult to transfer. As first described by Michael Polanyi, tacit knowledge is the knowledge of procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, M. (1962), Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-critical Philosophy, corrected edition, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a personal type of knowledge that cannot be shared simply through written or verbal communication. It is learned mostly through experience over time. For example, Toyota transfers tacit knowledge whenever it opens a new assembly factory. To train its new employees for a new factory, Toyota sends a group of its new employees to work at one of its established factories, where experienced employees train them. After this long-term training, they are sent back to the new factory to transfer their production knowledge to the rest of the new employees. This is a transfer of tacit knowledge since this knowledge is too complex to be codified and passed along through a document. This knowledge can only be transferred to new employees through practice and experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA3" /&gt;

=== Measuring learning ===
Organizational learning tracks the changes that occur within an organization as it acquires knowledge and experience. To evaluate organizational learning, the knowledge an organization creates, transfers, and retains must be quantified. Organizational learning is composed of concepts that are difficult to quantify. Measuring organizational learning requires combining different types of methodologies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dalkir, Kimiz (2011). "Knowledge Management in Theory and Practice". 2nd ed. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers studying organizational learning have measured the knowledge acquired through various ways since there is no one way of measuring it. Silvia Gherardi measured knowledge as the change in practices within an organization over time, which is essentially learning from experience.&lt;ref name="Gherardi, Silvia 20052" /&gt; In her study, she observed an organization acquire knowledge as its novices working at building sites learned about safety through experience and became practitioners. George Huber measured knowledge as the distribution of information within an organization. In his study, he noted that "organizational components commonly develop 'new' information by piecing together items of information that they obtain from other organizational units."&lt;ref name="Huber, George P 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huber | first1 = George P | year = 1991 | title = Organizational Learning: The Contributing Processes and the Literatures | jstor=2634941 | journal = Organization Science | volume = 2 | issue = 1| page = 100 | doi=10.1287/orsc.2.1.88}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gives the example of "a shipping department [that] learns that a shortage problem exists by comparing information from the warehouse with information from the sales department."&lt;ref name="Huber, George P 1991"/&gt;

An increasingly common and versatile measure of organizational learning is an organizational [[learning curve]] demonstrating [[experience curve effects]]. A learning curve measures the rate of a metric of learning relative to a metric for experience. Researcher Linda Argote explains that "large increases in productivity typically occur as organizations gain experience in production."&lt;ref name="Argote Book5"&gt;Argote, Linda. Organizational Learning: Creating, Retaining, and Transferring Knowledge. Boston: Kluwer Academic, 1999. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Argote also notes that organizations' rates of learning vary. Argote identifies three factors that affect these rates: increased proficiency of individuals, improvements in an organization's technology, and improvements in its structure (such as its routines and methods of coordination).&lt;ref name="Argote Book5" /&gt;  Some organizations show great productivity gains while others show little or no gains, given the same amount of experience.&lt;ref name="Argote Book5" /&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Experience curve.gif|right|frame|Fig 1. Experience Curve]] --&gt;The experience curves in Fig 1 plot the decreasing unit cost versus the total cumulative units produced, a common way to measure the effect of experience. The linear-linear input form on the left is transformed into the log-log form on the right to demonstrate that the proficiency increase correlates with experience.

=== Theoretical models ===
Attempts to explain variance of rates in organizational learning across different organizations have been explored in theoretical models. Namely the theoretical models conceived by John F. Muth, Bernardo Huberman, and Christina Fang.
* The '''Muth model''' (1986) was the first to represent the learning curve in a log-linear form and focused on cost effectiveness in organization processes. This model looks at the relationship between unit cost and experience, stating that cost reductions are realized through independent random sampling, or randomized searches, from a space of technological, managerial, or behavioral alternatives. This model did not aim to explore variation across firms, but solely looked at improvements in production with experience within a single firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=buh&amp;AN=7019715&amp;site=ehost-live|title = SEARCH THEORY AND THE MANUFACTURING PROGRESS FUNCTION|last = Muth|first = John F.|date = August 1986|journal = Management Science|doi = 10.1287/mnsc.32.8.948|volume=32|pages=948–962}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Huberman model''' (2001) filled that void and aimed at explaining the variation missing from Muth's model and focuses on finding increasingly shorter and more efficient paths from end to end of an assembly process. This model is visualized best in a connected graph with nodes that represent stages in a process and links that represent the connecting routines. By way of this model, learning can occur through two mechanisms that shorten the route from the initial stage to the final stage. The first is by some shortcut that can be identified by looking at the nodes and mapping and discovering new routines, the ideal goal being able to eliminate certain touch points and find shorter paths from the initial to final node. The second mechanism involves improving the routines: the organization can work to select the most efficacious link between two nodes such that, if an issue ever arises, members of an organization know exactly who to approach, saving them a considerable amount of time.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; 
*The '''Fang model''' (2011) shares a major goal with the Huberman model: to gradually decrease the steps towards the final stage. However, this model takes more of a "credit assignment" approach in which credit is assigned to successive states as an organization gains more experience, and then learning occurs by way of credit propagation. This implies that as an organization gains more experience with the task, it is better able to develop increasingly accurate mental models that initially identify the values of states closer to the goal and then those of states farther from the goal. This then leads to a reduced number of steps to reach the organization's final goal and can thus improve overall performance.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== Context and learning ===
An organization's experience affects its learning, so it is important to also study the context of the [[organizational climate]], which affects an organization's experience. This context refers to an organization's characteristics, specifically its "structure, culture, technology, identity, memory, goals, incentives, and strategy."&lt;ref name="Argote Spektor4" /&gt; It also includes its environment, which consists of its competitors, clients, and regulators.&lt;ref name="Argote Spektor4" /&gt; While this context establishes how knowledge is acquired by the organization, this knowledge modifies context as the organization adapts to it.&lt;ref name="Argote Spektor4" /&gt; The leader-initiated cultural context of learning has inspired key research into whether the organization has a learning or performance orientation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bunderson | first1 = J.

Psychol. | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 552–560 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.3.552}}&lt;/ref&gt; an environment of [[psychological safety]],&lt;ref name="Edmondson, Amy 19993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edmondson | first1 = Amy | year = 1999 | title = Psychological safety and learning behavior in work teams | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = 2| page = 350 | doi=10.2307/2666999}}&lt;/ref&gt; the group's superordinate identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kane | first1 = A.

=== Organizational forgetting ===
Knowledge acquired through learning by doing can depreciate over time. The depreciation rate is affected by the turnover rate of individuals and how knowledge is stored within the organization. Organizations with higher turnover rates will lose more knowledge than others. Organizations with knowledge embedded in technology rather than individuals are more resistant to organizational forgetting.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Examples: In the Liberty Shipyard study, in shipyards where relative input was reduced, individual unit cost increased even with increasing cumulative output. In shipyards with no relative input reduction, individual unit cost decreased with increasing cumulative output.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; In a study of airplane manufacturing at Lockheed, unit costs declined with experience, but this effect weakened over time.&lt;ref name=benkard/&gt;

== Processes ==
Three key processes that drive organizational learning are knowledge creation, knowledge retention, and knowledge transfer.

=== Knowledge creation ===
Knowledge creation specifically concerns [[Experience]] that can be embedded within the organization. Experience is knowledge generated by direct exposure to the subject. This direct exposure is through tasks involving the needs, processes, and environment of the organization. Explicit and tacit knowledge are reinforced and become contextualized when the organization gains knowledge. While experience can produce outputs in data, information, or knowledge, experience in the form of knowledge is useful since this can be transferred, retained, and tacitly or explicitly utilized within organizational processes. Knowledge creation connects to creativity and its relationship to experience.&lt;ref name="Argote 20113"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Argote|first1 = L.|title = Organizational learning research: Past, present and future|journal = Management Learning|volume = 42|issue = 4|year = 2011|pages = 439–446|issn = 1350-5076|doi = 10.1177/1350507611408217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = A | last2 = Greve | first2 = HR | year = 2006 | title = Superman or the fantastic four?

* The '''artificiality dimension''' refers to the directness of the experience and the degree to which the experience is fabricated, adapted, or transcribed.

=== Knowledge transfer ===
[[Knowledge transfer]] concerns the mechanisms by which experience spreads and embeds itself within the organization. Knowledge transfer can be evaluated using various metrics, including learning curves that demonstrate process improvements over time by comparing the decrease in labor hours to complete a unit of production with the cumulative units produced over time. Wright's identification of organizational learning curves preceded more complex outcome considerations&lt;ref name="Argote Book5" /&gt; that now inform measures of knowledge transfer. While knowledge may transfer tacitly and explicitly as direct experience, organizations can introduce processes and knowledge management systems that facilitate this transfer. Researchers investigate the context of various factors and mechanisms affecting knowledge transfer to determine their beneficial and detrimental effects.

'''Factors''' on knowledge transfer include the dimensions of the knowledge described in the prior section, as well as the contexts in which it occurs and mechanisms through which it can occur:
* '''Relational context''' concerns whether knowledge is interconnected.&lt;ref name="Darr ED 19952"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Darr | first1 = ED | last2 = Argote | first2 = L | last3 = Epple | first3 = D | year = 1995 | title = The acquisition, transfer and depreciation of knowledge in service organizations: Productivity in franchises | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 41 | issue = 11| pages = 1750–1762 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.41.11.1750}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Cognitive context''' concerns mental abilities and processes regarding knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Szulanski, G. (1996).  Exploring external stickiness:  Impediments to the transfer of best practice within the firm.  Strategic Management Journal, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Motivational context''' of personal preferences and social influences affect direct or indirect knowledge transfer behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;(Osterloh &amp; Frey, 2000; Quigley, Tesluk, Locke &amp; Bartol, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Emotional context''' impacts mental state and sense of security, which affect knowledge transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elkjaer | first1 = B | year = 2004 | title = Organizational learning: The 'third way' | url = | journal = Management Learning | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 419–434 | doi=10.1177/1350507604048271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = DZ | last2 = Kurtzberg | first2 = T | last3 = Phillips | first3 = KW | last4 = Lount | first4 = RB | last5 = Jnr | first5 =  | year = 2010 | title = The role of affect in knowledge transfer | url = | journal = Group Dynamics | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 123–142 | doi=10.1037/a0017317}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Social networks''' determine the flows through which knowledge can transfer and the node-based conditional limitations on transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = M | year = 1999 | title = The search-transfer problem: The role of weak ties in sharing knowledge across organizational subunits | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 82–112 | doi=10.2307/2667032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reagans | first1 = R | last2 = McEvily | first2 = B | year = 2003 | title = Network structure and knowledge transfer: The effects of cohesion and range | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 240–267 | doi=10.2307/3556658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knowledge retention ===
Knowledge retention concerns the behavior of knowledge that has been embedded within the organization, characterized by the organizational memory. Organizational memory, quantified by measures such as cumulative knowledge and the rate of decay over time, is impacted by experience, processes and knowledge repositories that affect knowledge retention.&lt;ref name="Darr ED 19952" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Argote L 19902" /&gt;&lt;ref name=benkard&gt;Benkard CL. 2000.

In a study of organizational learning in the automotive and fast food industries, Argote found that high turn over rates lead to lower productivity and decreased organizational memory.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Applications of organizational learning research and contexts for organizational learning facilitation and practices are numerous. Experience curves can be used to make projections of production costs, compare performance across units, identify the effects of various processes and practices, and make informed financial decisions about how to allocate resources. Utilizing knowledge transfer and retention concepts to recognize, maintain, and reclaim embedded knowledge can help organizations become more efficient with their knowledge. Organizational learning theories and knowledge management practices can be applied to organizational design and leadership decisions.

== Knowledge management practices ==
Various [[knowledge management]] concepts and practices are the relevant products of organizational learning research. Work on knowledge transfer applies to knowledge retention and contributes to many of the applications listed below, including the practices of building [[learning organization]]s, implementing knowledge management systems, and its context for inter organizational learning and the diffusion of [[innovation]]s.&lt;ref name="Argote Book5" /&gt;

=== Development of learning organizations ===
[[Learning organization]]s are organizations that actively work to optimize learning. Learning organizations use the active process of [[knowledge management]] to design organizational processes and systems that concretely facilitate knowledge creation, transfer, and retention. [[Corporate Brain|Organizational metacognition]] is used to refer to the processes by which the organization 'knows what it knows'. The study of organizational learning and other fields of research such as [[organizational development]], [[System theory]], and [[cognitive science]] provide the theoretical basis for specifically prescribing these interventions.&lt;ref name="Senge20102"&gt;{{cite book|author = Peter M. Senge|title = The Fifth Discipline: The Art &amp; Practice of The Learning Organization|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC|date = 31 March 2010|publisher = Crown Publishing Group|isbn = 978-0-307-47764-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an organizational process implemented to increase organizational learning is the U.S. Army's use of a formally structured de-brief process called an [[after-action review]] (AAR) to analyze what happened, why it happened, and how it could be improved immediately after a mission. Learning laboratories are a type or learning organization dedicate to knowledge creation, collection, and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Strategic Learning in a Knowledge Economy|last = Cross|first = Rob|publisher = |year = 2000|isbn = 0-7506-7223-4|location = |pages = 92|last2 = Israelit|first2 = Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning organizations also address [[organizational climate]] by creating a supportive learning environment and practicing leadership that reinforces learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edmondson | first1 = A. | last2 = Garvin | first2 = D. | last3 = Gino | first3 = F. | year = 2008 | title = Is yours a learning organization? | url = | journal = Harvard Business Review | volume = 86 | issue = 3| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating a supportive learning environment and reinforcing learning depends on the leadership of the organization and the culture it promotes. Leaders can create learning opportunities by facilitating environments that include learning activities, establishing a culture of learning via norms, behaviors, and rules, and lead processes of discourse by listening, asking questions, and providing feedback. Leaders must practice the individual learning they advocate for by remaining open to new perspectives, being aware of personal biases, seeking exposure to unfiltered and contradictory sources of information, and developing a sense of humility.&lt;ref&gt;Garvin, D. A. (2000). Learning in action: A Guide to putting the learning organization to work. Boston: Harvard Business School Press (Chapter 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge management systems===
While learning processes depend on the context for optimizing knowledge transfer, the implementation of [[knowledge management systems]] incorporates technology into these processes. Knowledge management systems are technologies that serve as a repository, communication, or collaboration tool for transferring and retaining knowledge.&lt;ref name="Argote Book5" /&gt; Embedding knowledge in technology can prevent organizational forgetting&lt;ref&gt;Smunt, T. L. 1987. The Impact of Worker Forgetting on
Production Scheduling. Int. J. Prod. Res. 25, 689-701.&lt;/ref&gt; and allow knowledge to transfer across barriers such as distance, organizational unit, and specialization. Knowledge management systems alone are not necessarily successful, but as a communication tool they tangibly reinforce individuals' ability to spread and reinforce their knowledge.&lt;ref name="Argote Book5" /&gt;

=== Diffusion of innovation ===
Organizational learning is important to consider in relation to [[innovation]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[technological change]], and [[economic growth]], specifically within the contexts of [[knowledge sharing]] and inter organizational learning.  As one of the key dynamics behind the [[knowledge economy]], organizational learning informs our understanding of knowledge transfer between organizations. Heterogeneous experience yields better learning outcomes than homogenous experience, and knowledge diffusion spreads heterogeneous experience across organizations.&lt;ref name="Sullivan BN 20022" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, M. A., P. Vidal, R. Ployhart, A. Marangoni. 2003. Learning by doing something else: Variation, relatedness, and organizational learning. Management Sci. 49 39-56.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diffusion of innovations]] theory explores how and why people adopt new ideas, practices and products. It may be seen as a subset of the anthropological concept of diffusion and can help to explain how ideas are spread by individuals, social networks, and organizations. Innovation policy, economic development initiatives, educational program endeavors, and entrepreneurial incubation and acceleration could all be informed by organizational learning practices.

== Barriers and enablers to organizational learning ==

=== Corporate amnesia ===
In case no systematic approach has been applied when creating organizational memory systems, there is a risk of corporate amnesia. Environment of organizational amnesia leads to avoiding mistakes at all cost. Companies should create an environment where learning from mistakes is allowed in order to avoid them happening again.&lt;ref name=DALKIR-K-2011&gt;Dalkir, K. (2011) ‘Knowledge Management in Theory and Practice’, in Knowledge Management in Theory and Practice. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 366, 372, 390}} Corporate amnesia is said to be a double-edged sword – it helps to move on by forgetting the wrongdoing, but at the same time it creates a danger of repeating the same error all over again.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer, A. (2015) VW and the toxic problem of corporate amnesia | Guardian Sustainable Business | The Guardian, Guardian sustainable business. Available at: https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/09/vw-bp-corporate-scandals-emissions-tests-oil-spill-horsemeat-rana-plaza (Accessed: 5 October 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developing organizational memory ===
Organizations need to have an organizational memory, a documentation of their milestone events. That documentation needs to be accessible for all involved to have the ability to learn as an organization.&lt;ref name=DALKIR-K-2011/&gt;{{rp| 365}} Because organizations have a routine of forgetting what they have done in the past and why, organizational memory systems should be created to make the knowledge explicit so that the transparency, coordination and communication in the organizations increase and it becomes possible to learn from past mistakes.&lt;ref name=DALKIR-K-2011/&gt;{{rp| 372–373}} OL grows through processes but the essential material is individual's memory, culture and experience. Individual learning is the first level in OL. Transfer process to OL is synthesized by "what people learn (know-what) and how they understand and apply this learning (know-how).&lt;ref&gt;KIM, D. The Link between Individual and Organizational Learning. pp. 41–62. {{DOI|10.1016/b978-0-7506-9850-4.50006-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While learning is the know-how, memory could be perceived as a storage area. Memory plays an active role in a learning process. In a transfer mechanism, mental models are an excellent way to share knowledge and to make it independent from individuals.

Organizational memory is an agglomerate of individual's memory, composed by data, information and knowledge. For those three levels of learning, five retention facilities are available:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walsh | first1 = James P. | last2 = Ungson | first2 = Gerardo Rivera | year = 1991 | title = Organizational Memory | url = | journal = The Academy of Management Review | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 57–91 | doi = 10.2307/258607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Individuals, with their own memory capacity and experience  
* Culture, perceived and thought experience transmitted to the members of the organization. Language is a cultural information transmitted repeatedly 
* Transformation, the logic and repeated continuation of actions transforming an input into an output  
* Structure, link between an individual and its role in the organization 
* External archives, information retailed by sources outside the organization about its past.

The big deal of organizational memory is its availability to be used and re-used. It could represent a competitive advantage but its value is often underestimated because of the complexity to calculate it, even though sometimes employee's, customer's, supplier's, capital's and top management's memory values are budgeted.&lt;ref&gt;Wijnhoven, F. (1999) ‘Development Scenarios for Organizational Memory Information Systems’, Journal of Management Information Systems, 16(1): 121–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organization's memory needs technological solutions on its side. Technology is often associated with information or communication technology (IT) which relates to different software solutions that support the organization's memory and ease the transfer of knowledge 
.&lt;ref name=ABDULAZIZ-A-2004&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abdulaziz Al-Tameem | first1 = A | year = 2004 | title = 'An inhibiting context hampering role of information technology as an enabler in organizational learning' | url = | journal = The Journal of Computer Information Systems | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 34–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology can be a barrier if it is not accepted or there is not enough understanding of new technologies. Technology can open for example new ways of communicating, but it is different to find a shared acceptance for its utilization.&lt;ref name=ARDICHVILI-A-2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ardichvili | first1 = Alexandre | year = 2008 | title = Learning and Knowledge Sharing in Virtual Communities of Practice: Motivators, Barriers, and Enablers | url = | journal = [[Advances in Developing Human Resources]] | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 541–554 | doi = 10.1177/1523422308319536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 550}}

IT is an enabler for codifying and distributing data and information as well as both tacit and explicit knowledge.&lt;ref name=ABDULAZIZ-A-2004/&gt; A. Abdulaziz Al-Tameem also states that the interaction between humans and IT enhances OL. Different repositories are used within organization to store corporate knowledge as an extension for the memory. Maintaining organizational memory is enabler for efficient and effective processes and routines but most of all for profitable business.&lt;ref name=ABDULAZIZ-A-2004/&gt;

=== The role of organizational culture ===
Culture is considered as the holding strength between members of an organization. Culture brings a representation of past learning and an instrument to communicate it through the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Schein, E. H. (1984) ‘Coming to a New Awareness of Organizational Culture’, Sloan Management Review, 25(2), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finding shared vision is important to enable the adaptation of new systems and technologies that can be accepted by the organization and its members. Sharing a culture and encouraging knowledge sharing allows more efficient transfer of knowledge in organization between its levels.&lt;ref name=ARDICHVILI-A-2008/&gt;{{rp| 547}} Sharing information between different cultures can be limited due to varying norms and it can end up in one or both sides hoarding knowledge &lt;ref name=ARDICHVILI-A-2008/&gt;{{rp| 543}}

Willingness to inquire can also be related to differences between culture groups or culture of multicultural organizations in general. Status, modesty, fear of embarrassment, etc. contribute to the interaction we decide or do not decide to initiate.&lt;ref name=ARDICHVILI-A-2008/&gt;{{rp| 546}} It has been studied that organizational culture is one of the most important enablers in knowledge sharing. When the information is not shared due to hoarding based on cultural differences it becomes a major barrier in business.&lt;ref name=ARDICHVILI-A-2008/&gt;{{rp| 547}}

Different influential factors regarding characteristics of an organizational culture (especially in knowledge-centered cultures) affect the processes of knowledge management. &lt;ref name="Intezari et al., 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Intezari |first1=Ali |last2=Taskin |first2=Nazim |last3=Pauleen |first3=David J. |title=Looking beyond knowledge sharing: an integrative approach to knowledge management culture |journal=Journal of Knowledge Management |date=2017 |volume=2 |doi=10.1108/JKM-06-2016-0216 |issn=1367-3270}}&lt;/ref&gt; these can include:

* Social interactions
* Openness in communication
* Trust
* Perception of Knowledge
* Top management's support and involvement
* Freedom vs. control
* Compensation system (organizational rewards)

=== Virtual environments ===

Organizations are evolving, which is sometimes causing interpretation of experiences more complex. Team members that are geographically apart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Argote | first1 = Linda | year = 2011 | title = Organizational learning research: Past, present and future | url = | journal = Management Learning | volume = 42 | issue = 4| pages = 439–446 | doi = 10.1177/1350507611408217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 266}} may only have an option to learn virtually through electronic devices instead of face-to-face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gibson | first1 = Cristina B. | last2 = Gibbs | first2 = Jennifer L. | year = 2016 | title = Unpacking the Concept of Virtuality: The Effects of Geographic Dispersion, Electronic Dependence, Dynamic Structure, and National Diversity on Team Innovation | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 451–495 | doi = 10.2189/asqu.51.3.451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities of practice in virtual environments can create tacit knowledge shared between the different factors such as individual members, rules accepted and technologies used. Technology in this case affects the identity and learning patterns of the community.&lt;ref name=ARDICHVILI-A-2008/&gt;{{rp|549}} Building routines in a virtual team and the use of sophisticated technology such as video meetings, creates trust and psychological safety that enables learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dixon | first1 = Nancy | year = 2017 | title = Learning together and working apart: routines for organizational learning in virtual teams | url = | journal = The Learning Organization | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 138–149 | doi = 10.1108/tlo-12-2016-0101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 148}}

=== Barriers in organizational learning from 4I framework ===

Developed by Crossan, Lane and White (1999) the 4I framework of organizational learning consists of four social processes; intuiting, interpreting, integrating and institutionalizing. It is proposed by Crossan et al. (1999)&lt;ref name="CROSSAN-M-1999" /&gt; that organizational learning is a dynamic and iterative process between exploration and exploitation (March 1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=March|first=J. G.|date=1991|title=Exploration and Exploitation in Organizational Learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2.1.71|journal=Organization Science|volume=2|pages=71-87|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with feed forward flowing from individual level to organizational level and feedback from organizational to individual. A pivotal characteristic of the framework is the relationship and interplay between action and cognition that it assumes and portrays. It is a framework that was developed to specifically address the phenomenon of strategic renewal.&lt;ref name=CROSSAN-M-1999&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crossan | first1 = Mary M. | last2 = Lane | first2 = Henry W. | last3 = White | first3 = Roderick E. | year = 1999 | title = "An Organizational Learning Framework: From Intuition to Institution". The | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 522–537 | doi = 10.2307/259140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Schilling and A. Kluge (2009) have contributed to the M. Crossan, H. Lane and R. White (1999) 4I framework of organizational learning by identifying the barriers to the learning process. There is a wide variety of barriers in every level of each learning process identified as actional-personal, structural-organizational and societal-environmental.&lt;ref name="Schilling, Jan 2370"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schilling | first1 = Jan | last2 = Kluge | first2 = Annette | year = 2009 | title = Barriers to organizational learning: An integration of theory and research | url = | journal = International Journal of Management Reviews | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 337–360 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2370.2008.00242.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actional-personal barriers include such as individual attitudes, thinking, and behavior. Structural-organizational barriers are based in organizational technology, strategy, culture and formality of regulations. In addition to the 4I model, environment is also considered as relevant at all individual, group and organization levels and that is why societal-environmental barriers are also considered. Intuition process barriers are related to individual's lack of motivation or such as what is the freedom in the organization to 'think out of the box'. Societal-environmental barriers of intuition process relate e.g. to the unclear success criteria of the branch of the organization or to cultural misunderstandings. Interpretation process barrier can be e.g. lack of status or a conflict in a relationship between innovator and the group. Integration process barriers that take place at the organizational level can be such as the willingness to maintain positive self-image or the fear of punishment. If the idea is against beliefs commonly held in the industry, the whole sector might reject the idea. A major barrier is, if there is no top management's support for the innovative idea. A barrier to institutionalization process is when something previously learned has been forgotten – an innovation or lesson has not been put to practice so that it would become embedded into the structure, procedures and strategy. Some teams or employees may not have enough skills or knowledge to absorb the innovation or there is not enough trust towards the innovation. Management may also have a lack of skills to implement the innovation.&lt;ref name="Schilling, Jan 2370"/&gt;

=== Other challenges ===
Several challenges may be identified during the organizational learning process. Milway and Saxton (2011) suggest three challenges related to goals, incentives and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milway|first=Katie Smith|last2=Saxton|first2=Amy|date=|title=The Challenge of Organizational Learning|url=|journal=Stanford Social Innovation Review|volume=9|issue=3|pages=44-50|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generational issues and employee turnover are also challenges that organizations might have to consider.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sprinkle|first=Therese A.|last2=Urick|first2=Michael J.|date=2018|title=Three generational issues in organizational learning: Knowledge management, perspectives on training and “low-stakes” development|url=|journal=Learning Organization|volume=25|issue=2|pages=102-112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Education]]''' – in the general sense is any act or [[experience]] that has a formative effect on the [[mind]], [[Moral character|character]], or physical ability of an individual. In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] from one generation to another. Education can also be defined as the process of becoming an educated person.&lt;ref&gt;Don, Berg. "Definition of Education." teach-kids-attitude-1st.com. N.p., n.d.

== Educational philosophies ==
* Traditions in education
** [[Idealism]] – This tradition emerged in Greece and the famous philosophers who introduced this concept were Socrates and his pupil Plato. The basic concept launched was that all the things we see in this world are actually the copy not original.  What ever we produce here becomes an idea in our mind. So whatever we work to create something is first takes shape in ideas and minds, so the true reality is Idealism.They both supported an education which provides the opportunity to develop mental faculties and make student think properly to find any reality.
** [[Philosophical realism|Realism]] – Aristotle, the pupil of Plato was the person who got the concept of Realism and argued that the Idealism is not the only reality, but there are many natural things which are the part of our atmosphere and we come across those things. Whatever we observe is very important to work on and find the realities using empirical evidences. So the education that is based on experience and observable realities will guide the students to find out the reality. The same has relevance to the philosophy of Positivism.
** [[Educational perennialism|Perennialism]] – This concept was introduced by Robert Hutchins who was of a view that the education should have ever-lasting impact on the students and therefore the only ever-last ideas should be taught. for that he supported the religious concepts to be incorporated in the curriculum.
** [[Existentialism]] – Kierkegaard argued that all the philosophers are of a view to inculcate into the students which is something outdoor with reference to the students. He told that realities are subjective and they are with the individuals themselves. The education should work on individuals to harness the inner realities.
** [[Theism]] – Thomas Aquinas introduced the church doctrine in education and emphasized that reason and faith are complimentary so the both ideas should be the base of education and the students should go by the reasons introduced by the faith, church or religion.
** [[Essentialism]] – The education philosophies were taking many turns in the twentieth century when William Bagley raised his voice to attract the attention of the theoreticians telling that the education should have a core basics of the culture and heritage. The students should be given choice of study the said core subject and they should go to the 1930s education where the same was used to teach.
** [[Pragmatism]] – John Dewey was the person who told that in education a democratic view is to be implemented. Students should be given a chance to explore themselves and they should go by their own instinctive drives.
** [[Critical thinking]] – There was a team of German theoreticians like Adorno, Horkheimer and Habermas who gave the concept of Critical Theory and argued that the education which provides the students and prepare them to analyze the things under discussion, is the basic requirement of education.
** [[Social education]] – In his book, Social Education, Applied Perspective, Muhammad Zahid Azeem Zahid has argued that the education which provides the opportunity to the students to find their space in society and the education should be in line with the societal need not only individually but holistically as well. The Social Education Model is to be implemented in the third world countries as there is a big need to join the individual and society. An educated person can become a good professional and can lead a good life individually, but the need of the day is that he or she should keep his profession and the lifestyle favorable to the society as well....

=== Schools ===

* [[School]] – an institution designed for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education (commonly compulsory), in which students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. Non-compulsory higher education follows, and is taught in institutions called a college or university.

[[File:Two people in a gym using BOSU balls.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A personal trainer demonstrating use of a [[Bosu]] ball.]]

A '''personal trainer''' is an individual certified to have a varying degree of knowledge of general fitness involved in [[exercise prescription]] and instruction. They motivate clients by setting goals and providing feedback and accountability to clients. Trainers also measure their client's strengths and weaknesses with fitness assessments. These fitness assessments may also be performed before and after an exercise program to measure their client's improvements in [[physical fitness]]. They may also educate their clients in many other aspects of wellness besides exercise, including general health and nutrition guidelines.  

Qualified personal trainers recognize their own areas of expertise. If a trainer suspects that one of their clients has a medical condition that could prevent the client from safe participation in an exercise program, they must refer the client to the proper health professional for prior clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Earle|first=Roger|title=NSCA's Essentials of Personal Training|year=2004|publisher=NSCA Certification Commission|isbn=0-7360-0015-1|pages=162, 617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of personal training ==
[[Image:Personal trainer assessing a client's goals and needs as they write a fitness programme.jpg|thumb|left|Personal trainer assessing a client's goals and needs as they write a fitness program]]  The scope of practice for a personal trainer is to enhance the components of fitness for the general, healthy population.

Proper [[exercise prescription]] may result in improved [[body composition]], physical performance, heart condition and health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, WJ. Exercise Physiology: Integrating Theory and Application. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Ahead of print, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision to hire a trainer may be related to a perceived ability to facilitate these factors through proper prescription and instruction or factors related to [[motivation]] and adherence. A trainer pays close attention to their client's exercise form, workout routine, and nutrition plan.

Few studies have investigated training for men, however, training in women has been shown to exercise behavior patterns, improve perceptual benefit-to-concern ratio for exercise (decisional balance), and increase confidence to choose exercise in the face of other time demands (scheduling self-efficacy).&lt;ref&gt;Fischer DV, Bryant J. Effect of certified personal trainer services on stage of exercise behavior and exercise mediators in female college students. J Am Coll Health. 2008 Jan-Feb;56(4):369-76. {{PMID|18316279}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal training results in higher strength, higher workout intensities, and higher perceived exertion during exercise in women. Although women working with personal trainers do self-select heavier loads than women who did not, the loads used are still below recommended training load percentages.&lt;ref&gt;Ratamess NA, Faigenbaum AD, Hoffman JR, Kang J. Self-selected resistance training intensity in healthy women: the influence of a personal trainer. J Strength Cond Res. 2008 Jan;22(1):103-11. {{PMID|18296962}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment characteristics ==

The profession is generally not restricted by venue, and personal trainers may work in fitness facilities, in their personal homes, in client homes, over live video (also called "virtual personal trainers"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/fl-virtual-training-google-hangouts-20130819-story.html |title=South Floridians giving webcam workouts rave reviews |first=Johnny |last=Diaz |date=August 30, 2013 |newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924111904/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/fl-virtual-training-google-hangouts-20130819-story.html |archivedate=September 24, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or outdoors. Almost all personal trainers and group exercise instructors work in physical fitness facilities, health clubs, and fitness centers located in the amusement and recreation industry or in civic and social organizations.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos296.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917084446/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos296.htm |archivedate=2008-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal training is not regulated in any jurisdiction in the United States except for Washington D.C. which adopted registration requirements for personal fitness trainers in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, David L, DC Opts to Regulate Personal Trainers, The Exercise, Sports and Sports Medicine Standards &amp; Malpractice Reporter, March, 2014, Volume 3, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal trainers may specialize in a certain training type, training philosophy, performance type, exercise modality, or client population. In general, most personal trainers develop exercise prescription plans for [[aerobic exercise]], [[resistance exercise]], and/or [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]] training. With aerobic exercise prescription, personal trainers determine the type of exercise, duration of exercise, and frequency of exercise. For resistance exercise prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, WJ. Exercise Physiology: Integrating Theory and Application. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Chapter 12. Ahead of print, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal trainers may also be involved in prescription of stretching routines or other approaches. Personal trainers help clients to perform exercises with correct technique, minimising the risk of injury. While some discuss nutrition, [[ergogenic]] supplementation, and spiritual practices with clients, there is debate within the industry as to whether it fits within their scope of practice and training qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Frances H. Q. | year = 2009 | title = Sport in Society: Cultures, Commerce, Media, Politics | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17430430802673726?journalCode=fcss20 | journal = Taylor &amp; Francis | volume = 12 | issue = 3| page = 375 | doi=10.1080/17430430802673726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
[[File:MARIANA DE MELO.JPG|thumb|upright=1.05|Personal training outdoors]]
Personal trainer accreditation is a process that provides [[certification]] of competency as a personal trainer. Qualification standards for personal trainers vary between countries.

===Australia===
In Australia, personal trainers may work independently with suitable insurance or choose to be a member of a registering body (Fitness Australia or Physical Activity Australia). The qualifications levels include; Level 1 - Certificate III in Fitness, Level 2 - Certificate IV in Fitness and Level 3 - Diploma of Fitness. These can be obtained from nationally accredited colleges (TAFE, Australian College of Sport &amp; Fitness, Fitness Industry Training, Global Fitness Institute, [[Australian Institute of Fitness]], Australian Fitness Academy). Once working in the industry, trainers who are members of associations are also required to complete short courses to obtain [[continuing education unit|continuing education credit]] (CEC) points they need to keep their registration. A minimum of 20 CEC points every two years is required. Many personal trainers also have additional qualifications in weight loss, strength training, kid's fitness, and nutrition, which is in part due to the CEC program. CEC courses can cover a wide variety of topics such as different training techniques, nutrition, exercise styles, health conditions, physiology, lifestyle and rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fitness.org.au/116127_47417047.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304124800/http://www.fitness.org.au/116127_47417047.html |date=March 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], personal trainers must have a [[bachelor's degree]] in "Physical Education" (a degree that combines knowledge in the fields of [[Exercise Science]] and [[Healthcare science]]) and be registered with the Conselho Federal de Educação Física (Federal Council of Physical Education), and risk criminal charges if they operate without these two requirements.

===Canada===
In Canada, the main certifying bodies are Canadian Fitness Education Services (CFES), Canadian Fitness Professionals, Certified Personal Trainers Network, and Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology. CSEP requires a diploma or degree in the exercise field, most require experience and/or workshops. Ontario does not have any personal training regulation. Many personal trainers receive a CFES, CanFit Pro certification or an NCCA accredited certification. The National Personal Training Institute is the only private trade school and is a registered College under the Private Career Colleges Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalpti.edu/school/toronto-ontario/|title=Personal Trainer Certification in Toronto, Ontario|website=nationalpti.edu|access-date=2016-05-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514224822/http://nationalpti.edu/school/toronto-ontario|archivedate=2016-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Johnathan|last=Goodman|title=Top Personal Training Certifications: Canada|url=http://www.theptdc.com/2011/11/top-personal-training-certifications-canada/|accessdate=29 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523140438/http://www.theptdc.com/2011/11/top-personal-training-certifications-canada/|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In Europe, personal trainers may work independently, but will always need accreditation by one of the main certifying bodies  {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} such as:

'''NASM:''' National Academy of Sports Medicine. NASM Certified Personal Trainers are eligible to join the European Register of Exercise Professionals (EREPS). The NASM has attributed to the success of personal trainers in Europe and accredited companies like UNITEDFIT in the Netherlands became recognized as a qualified fitness organization in Europe.

'''EREPS:''' The European Register of Exercise Professionals (EREPS) is an independent process for the registering of instructors, trainers and teachers working in the European health, fitness and physical activity sector. It is a pan-European system, based on independent national registers, which culminate in a central European database.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, there are several ways to achieve a personal training qualification. Most personal training qualifications are accredited through awarding bodies like CYQ (Central YMCA Qualifications), Active IQ (Active International Qualifications) and City and Guilds. These qualifications are generally delivered by [[Further Education]] (FE) establishments like colleges, or by private training providers. Upon successful completion of an accredited awarding body qualification, candidates become eligible for Level 3 REPs(Register of Exercise Professionals)status. University graduates with an appropriate honours degree can also apply to become an approved by REPs through Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) and Accreditation of Prior Achievement (APA).

REPs is the professional body for the UK health and fitness industry, and does not award qualifications directly. Most health and fitness qualifications endorsed by REPs vary in levels from 1 - 5, 1 being basic GCSE level and 5 being advanced specialized training professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exerciseregister.org/about-reps/reps-entry-structure |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920065949/http://exerciseregister.org/about-reps/reps-entry-structure |archivedate=2012-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a qualification to become eligible for endorsement by REPs, it must conform to the [[National Occupational Standards]] (NOS), which are set at governmental level by the [[Sector Skills Council]] (SSC) Skills Active.

There is no legal restriction on the title of Personal Trainer nor any formal body associated with regulating Personal Training.

===United States===
A number of certifications are available in the U.S., although a number are not accredited. Most require a high school diploma, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) and [[automated external defibrillator]] (AED) certification, and some type of examination.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"/&gt;

A 2002 investigation evaluated a random sample of 115 personal trainers using the Fitness Instructors Knowledge Assessment (FIKA) (which measures knowledge in nutrition, health screening, testing protocols, exercise prescription, and special populations). The study described that:&lt;ref&gt;Malek MH, Nalbone DP, Berger DE, Coburn JW. Importance of health science education for personal fitness trainers. J Strength Cond Res. 2002 Feb;16(1):19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moh H. Malek, PhD, CSCS,*D and Tamara K. Coburn. The Level of Exercise Science Knowledge Among Personal Fitness Trainers: A Guideline.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20100509062447/http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Personal%20Trainers%20Knowledge.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;
* 70% of those surveyed did not have a degree in any field related to [[exercise science]].
* Those who did not have a [[bachelor's degree]] in an exercise science-related field scored 31% less on average than those with a bachelor's degree or higher in the field.
* Those holding one of two specific certifications (the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] (ACSM) or the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) certification) scored 83% of the questions correctly on average. Those holding any certification other than ACSM or NSCA answered only 38% of the questions correctly.
* Years of experience was not found to be predictive of personal trainer knowledge.

In partnership with the fitness industry, the International Health, Racquet &amp; Sportsclub Association (IHRSA), which represents over 9,000 health and fitness facilities, started an initiative in 2002 to improve standards for both its own clubs and the industry as a whole. In January 2006, IHRSA implemented a recommendation that its facilities only accept personal trainers with certifications recognized by the [[National Commission for Certifying Agencies]] (NCCA) if recognized either by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and/or the U.S. [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] (USDE). As a result, the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC) was recognized by IHRSA as a recognized accreditor of fitness professional certification organizations.  Since then, the DETC has accredited several personal trainer certification organizations, including the [[Aerobics and Fitness Association of America|Aerobics and Fitness Association of America (AFAA)]] and the International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA) among others.  As of August 2012, [[National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM)|NASM]], ISSA, AFAA, ACSM and NSCA certifications are among the 15 accredited certifications recognized by IHRSA, three of which are accredited by the Distance Education Training Council (DETC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihrsa.org/home/2010/1/14/accreditation-announcement-to-ihrsa-members.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413080001/http://www.ihrsa.org/home/2010/1/14/accreditation-announcement-to-ihrsa-members.html |archivedate=2011-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Trainers as Professionals|url=http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/august/personal-trainers-as-professionals|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=19 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130920012400/http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/august/personal-trainers-as-professionals|archivedate=20 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various organizations within the profession have lobbied for the adoption of a more stringent criteria for certification developed by the [[NSF International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cotton|first=Richard|title=Personal Trainers as Professionals|url=http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/august/personal-trainers-as-professionals|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=19 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130920012400/http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/august/personal-trainers-as-professionals|archivedate=20 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There remains no national legal restriction on the industry to date except for the District of Columbia (D.C.) which as of February 2014, passed legislation requiring personal fitness trainers to register in that jurisdiction. The law went into effect in the first half of 2014.

'''''Pygmalion in the Classroom''''' is a 1968 book by [[Robert Rosenthal (psychologist)|Robert Rosenthal]] and [[Lenore Jacobson]] about the effects of teacher expectation on first and second grade student performance.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, R., &amp; Jacobson, L. (1968). ''Pygmalion in the classroom: Teacher expectation and pupils' intellectual development''. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston&lt;/ref&gt; The idea conveyed in the book is that if teachers' expectations about student ability are manipulated early, those expectations will carry over to affect teacher behavior, which in turn will influence how the students will perform on an IQ test. Inducing high expectations in teachers will lead to high levels of IQ test performance. Inducing low expectations, will lead to low IQ test performance.

[[Robert L. Thorndike]], the leading [[educational psychology|educational psychologist]] of his era, found serious flaws in the instrument used to assess the IQ scores of the children in the Pygmalion study.&lt;ref name="Thorndike"&gt;Thorndike, R.L. (1968). Reviewed work: Pygmalion in the classroom by Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson.''American Educational Research Journal, 5''(4), 708-711.&lt;/ref&gt; One regular class in the study had a mean Reasoning IQ score deep in the retarded range, an impossibility. Thorndike concluded that the study's findings were worthless, summing up his evaluation of the instrument by writing, "When the clock strikes thirteen, doubt is not only cast on the last stroke but also on all that have come before....When the clock strikes 14, we throw away the clock."&lt;ref name="Thorndike"/&gt; Meta-analytic research has found that the amount of time a teacher spends getting to know students prior to the induction of IQ-related expectancies reduces the impact of expectancy induction.&lt;ref&gt;Raudenbush, S. W. (1984). Magnitude of teacher expectancy effects on pupil IQ as a function of the credibility of expectancy induction: A synthesis of findings from 18 experiments. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 76'', 85-97. doi:10.1037/0022-0663.76.1.85&lt;/ref&gt; The findings indicate when teachers have gotten to know their students for more than two weeks prior to expectancy induction, the influence of expectancy induction is virtually nil.

'''Research associates''' are scholars and professionals that usually have an advanced degree beyond a [[bachelor's degree]]. The research associate position does not explicitly require mentoring and is a regular staff position with appointment letters processed by Human Resources. In contrast to a [[research assistant]], a research associate often has a [[graduate degree]], such as a [[Master's degree|master's]] (e.g. [[Master of Science]]) or in some cases Master of Engineering or a doctoral degree (e.g. [[Doctor of Philosophy]], [[Doctor of Medicine]] or [[Doctor of Pharmacy]]). In some cases it can be synonymous with [[postdoctoral research]].

[[File:Rock the World logo.jpg|250px|right]]

'''Rock the World Youth Mission Alliance''' is a [[Christian ministry]] that trains young people as [[leader]]s. Their [[core training]] programs create an ongoing network of relationships where the grads and trainees collaborate to offer events and [[Meeting|conferences]], generate new ministries, and support one another in life and ministry.

Among other programs, Rock the World currently runs the Josiah Project, a summer collegiate leadership initiative; re:mix, an annual conference for young people ages 14–30; Ambridge Youth Ignite, a local ministry with kids in Rock the World’s home town of [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Ambridge, PA]]; and "Next Step" retreats for kids in [[middle school]] through high school. Rock the World's activities exist predominantly inside the [[United States|USA]] but extend globally.

'''Mission of Rock the World'''
The stated mission of Rock the World is to “engage, equip and empower young people to advance God's Kingdom.”  The longer version of their mission states “Rock the World’s mission is to mobilize young people to follow [[Jesus]], grow together in knowledge and love of [[God]], serve in the power of the Spirit, and impact the world for the Kingdom of God.” Both versions emphasize the capacity of Jesus' young [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to make more disciples. The long-term goal of RTWYMA is to ignite a [[spiritual awakening]] among young people on every continent.

Rock the World is not legally a part of any [[Denomination (Christianity)|denomination]]. At its founding, Rock the World was informally associated with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]. By the end of the 1990s this association had broadened to include a wide range of denominations. Although Rock the World is officially independent of any denomination, [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] influence still finds expression through the involvement of so many Anglicans in the ministry.

==Founder==
The Rev. Whis Hays founded Rock the World in 1989. After 14 years in ministry with [[college]], high school, and middle school young people, he saw the need for a new ministry that gave leverage to the energy, dedication, and fresh [[insight]] of young Christian leaders. His published works include numerous articles and films, the best known of which are his 1995 article “Arresting the New Sexual McCarthyism” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rocktheworld.org/Publisher/Article.aspx?ID=1000042372&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1980 film, “Jesus, Head of the Church.” He is also known for 16 years of teaching [[youth ministry]] courses as Associate Professor of Youth Ministry at [[Trinity School for Ministry]], teaching there while serving in his position as Rock the World’s Executive Director.

==Name==
The organization derives its name from the [[Bible]]'s [[Acts of the Apostles|book of Acts]], chapter 17 verse 6. The story makes it clear that [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and his friends were not trying to make trouble, but only trying to speak about Jesus and act according to the Kingdom of God. Obviously, sometimes this shook up things around them! When young followers of Jesus do the same thing today, it's not unusual for them to get similar results.

==Primary Ministries==
Rock the World has offered 3 core training programs:

1. In 1990 Rock the World launched the Josiah Project, a two-summer [[leadership]] program for college students. The main focus of this program is preparing students for a lifetime of leadership by giving them classroom training, hands-on experience, and the opportunity to launch new ministries. Josiah graduates are proving to be effective leaders: more than 90% of Josiah graduates continue to be involved in Christian ministry leadership today.

2. Epicenter was a one-year internship program, launched in 2004, last offered in 2009. This one-year internship focused on student ministry leadership training, also including elements of cross-cultural ministry and planting of micro-church movements.

3. Beginning in 1991, Rock the World's Student Ministry Professionals Program offered the first master's degree in youth ministry anywhere in the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] in partnership with Trinity School for Ministry. Graduates prepared for a career in youth ministry through the local church. This program was offered for 15 years, through Spring Semester of 2006. The basic content of this training is still available through Rock the World's ''Striking Fire'' seminars.

==Incubated Ministries==
Rock the World has become the platform for a number of new ministries launched by their graduates and trainees, some of which become a permanent part of Rock the World. Current programs and ministries that express this feature of Rock the World include [http://Sonward%20Youth%20Programs%20of%20New%20Kensington,%20PA Sonward Youth Programs]; [https://www.heart4jamaica.org/ Heart for Jamaica]; and [https://www.facebook.com/GoodShepherdLongview/ Good Shepherd Anglican Church of Longview, TX]. 

re:mix&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rocktheworld.org/remix&lt;/ref&gt; is a "Kingdom Outbreak" conference launched in 2003 for young adults and high school youth. The re:mix founder who is also a Josiah Project graduate, says “re:mix helps young people go further in with God and further out to spread Jesus' message of the Kingdom of God both locally and globally.” The re:mix conference is always offered alongside the [https://newwineskins.org/about-our-conferences/ New Wineskins conferences], and is also scheduled at other times and places.

One of these launches was Ambridge Youth Ignite (AYI),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rocktheworld.org/AYI&lt;/ref&gt; a holistic outreach to children and middle school youth in Rock the World's hometown of Ambridge, PA. AYI was created in 2004 by Josiah Project students Eric and Shea Rankin Geisbert who met while participating in Rock the World's Josiah Project. AYI's final program wrapped up in 2014. There have been many other programs launched this way, such as Three Nails, Pittsburgh Summer College Fellowship, Living Stones, and numerous others. 

Some programs that started within Rock the World have spun off to become their own ministries, such as inneracts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inneracts.org&lt;/ref&gt; 

Incubation of new ministries is continuing as trainees and graduates are inspired to pursue fresh initiatives. Please check [http://www.rocktheworld.org Rock the World's website] for current information.

==Other ministries==
Rock the World also offers various retreats and weekend leadership training [[seminar]]s, such as Striking Fire, a weekend training event, and Next Step, a retreat for middle school and high school kids themed on following Jesus. Rock the World also engages in various global initiatives, having consistent partnerships with All Nations Family &lt;ref&gt;http://www.allnations.us&lt;/ref&gt; and Anglican Global Mission Partners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agmp-na.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network==
Rock the World’s trainees and graduates are spread out across most of the United States and several foreign countries, serving in [[church (building)|church]]es, [[school]]s, and other contexts. Aside from founder Whis Hays, Rock the World’s longest-serving employees have been (in order of longevity) Meredith B., Steven Tighe, Carol Jaros, and Cynthia Seeliger Seifert. Some graduates especially well known in student ministry circles include Holly Rankin Zaher, Aran Walter, Joel Tassie, Dixon Kinser, Steven Tighe and Jack Gabig. Thousands of young people are touched by the ministries of Rock the World graduates, and hundreds decide to follow Jesus every year.

'''Sara Miranda Maxson Cobb''' (née '''Sara Miranda Maxson'''; also known as '''Sara M. Maxson-Cobb'''; September 30, 1858 – January 24, 1917) was a 19th-century American [[Visual arts education|art teacher]], artist, and writer from the U.S. state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. She served as director of the Art School of the [[Kents Hill School|Maine Wesleyan Seminary and Female College]] at [[Kents Hill, Maine]], and taught drawing at [[Colorado State University]].

==Early years and education==
Sara Miranda Maxson was born in [[Geneva, New York]], September 30, 1858. She was the daughter of Dr. Edwin R. and Lucy Lanphear Maxson.{{sfn|Utter|1917|p=319-20}} She traces her lineage on her father's side to the Maxtons, of [[Maxton, Roxburghshire|Maxton-on-the-Tweed]], in Scotland. Her father's family came to America in 1701, after having been settled in England for generations. Her father, Edwin Robinson Maxson, A.M., M.D., LL.D., a graduate of [[Thomas Jefferson University|Jefferson Medical College]], [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, had been a lecturer on medical subjects in the colleges of Philadelphia and Geneva. His ''Practice of Medicine'' and ''Hospitals: British, French and American'' were well-known books. Her mother, Lucy Potter Lamphere, was of French-English ancestry.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=186}} 

In 1864, the family removed to [[Adams, New York]], where Cobb spent much of her childhood. Her earliest education was received from her parents.{{sfn|Utter|1917|p=319-20}} When very young, she started writing for amateur papers. At the age of eight, happening to read an article on drawing, she tried her pencil at reproducing the simple cuts given in it for copying, with a success so surprising to herself that she then and there resolved to become an artist. Thereafter, she received training in drawing.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=186}}  In 1872, Cobb entered the [[John N. Hungerford#Philanthropist|Hungerford Collegiate Institute]] at Adams, where she studied for two years. The family removed to [[Syracuse. New York]], in 1874, where, for five years, she studied in the public schools of that city, graduating at the Syracuse High School in 1879.{{sfn|Utter|1917|p=319-20}} For the next four years she was in the Liberal Art College of Syracuse University, where she graduated with the degree of Ph. B., in 1883. She then took up the painting course in the Fine Art College of the university, graduating with the degree of Bachelor of painting in 1886. In 1890. Syracuse Universitv granted her the degree of PhD, on examination in Art History.{{sfn|Utter|1917|p=319-20}}  She was a member of the Alpha chapter of the college society, [[List of Alpha Phi chapters|Alpha Phi]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=186}}

==Career==
Through the late Chancellor C. N. Sims of the university, she obtained the position of director of the Art School of the Maine Wesleyan Seminary and Female College at [[Kents Hill, Maine]], a position she held from 1886 to 1890. During that time, in 1888, she was one of a large party to visit the United Kingdom and France.{{sfn|Utter|1917|p=319-20}}  

In 1890, she was married to Professor Herbert Edgar Cobb, a member of the faculty at the Maine Wesleyan Seminary and a graduate of the Wesleyan University at [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. In the same year, her husband was called to a position on the faculty of the [[Colorado State University]]. At this university Mrs. Cobb was a teacher of drawing from 1890 to 1892. In the latter year, she and her husband removed to Chicago, Illinois, where her busband was employed for a time in the Extension Department of the [[University of Chicago]], afterwards receiving a position on the faculty of the [[Lewis Institute]], where he headed the Mathematical Department. In 1906 and 1907, her husband had leave of absence from the Lewis Institute, to pursue higher mathematical studies at the [[University of Berlin]]. Maxson-Cobb accompanied her husband on this trip, and taking art lectures at the University of Berlin.{{sfn|Utter|1917|p=319-20}}

==Personal life==
Cobb was engaged in philanthropic work and the study of social science since 1892.{{sfn|Syracuse University|1899|p=377}} A strong literary taste and sympathy for active philanthropic and Christian enterprise led her into many additional types of work. Her numerous poems, stories told in verse, translations from the German, travel correspondence, and articles on art subjects were included in prominent publications.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=186}} Cobb was a believer in united action, and in the many societies to which she belonged, missionary, temperance, art, literary and scientific, she was recognized as a superior organizer and leader. Geology, microscopy and photography claimed a share of her attention, and she had an interesting collection of specimens of her own finding, slides of her own mounting and photographs of her own taking. She delighted in music and had a cultivated [[contralto]] voice.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=186}} 

Cobb died January 24, 1917 from [[apoplexy]] at the Frances Willard Hospital in [[Chicago, Illinois]], after a very brief illness,{{sfn|Utter|1917|p=319-20}} and was buried in Union Cemetery, [[Adams Center, New York]].&lt;ref name="findagrave.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cobb, Sarah Maxson|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gsr&amp;GSln=Maxson&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScty=99226&amp;|website=www.findagrave.com|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FLHS School Schedule.jpg|thumbnail|right|Empty timetable sheet showing time slot allocations.]]
A '''school timetable''' is a table for coordinating these four elements:
* [[Student]]s
* [[Teacher]]s
* [[Classroom|Room]]s
* [[Period (school)|Time slots]] (also called periods)

Other factors include the subject of the class, and the type of classrooms available (for example, science laboratories).

School timetables usually cycle every week or every fortnight. The phrase "school timetables" largely refers to [[high school]]s, because primary schools typically have simple structures.

==High school==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
High school timetables are quite different from [[university]] timetables. The main difference is that in high schools, students have to be occupied and supervised every hour of the school day, or nearly every hour. Also, high school teachers generally have much higher teaching loads than is the case in universities. As a result, it is generally considered that university timetables involve more human judgement whereas high school timetabling is a more computationally intensive task, see [[constraint satisfaction problem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1999-12-16|title=Constraint satisfaction problems: Algorithms and applications|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221798003646|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|language=en|volume=119|issue=3|pages=557–581|doi=10.1016/S0377-2217(98)00364-6|issn=0377-2217}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* '''Block''': This term is ambiguous, but in this article it refers to a set of lessons of different courses that must be placed concurrently.
* '''Student body''': A set of students who are timetabled together, for example the 8A roll-call group.
* '''Band (or cluster)''': A set of classes involving the same student body, which are therefore horizontally linked, meaning they must be on separate periods.
* '''Year group''' or '''year level''': A set of students at the same stage of their schooling, for example Year 9.
* '''Elective line''': A block of many classes of many subjects such that each student may choose one subject from the line.

==Types==
Primary school typically has timetables&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timecenter.com/articles/tips-for-making-and-following-a-study-schedule/|title=Tips for Making &amp; Following a Study Schedule|website=www.timecenter.com|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, however the timetable is usually so simple that it can be constructed manually or in a basic [[spreadsheet]] package&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techwalla.com/articles/types-of-spreadsheet-packages|title=Types of Spreadsheet Packages {{!}} Techwalla.com|work=Techwalla|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In some countries and regions, such as [[China]] and [[East Africa]], high school students are not given any choice in subjects, and this makes timetabling easy - the students can remain in the one room all day while the teachers rotate.

In other countries, such as [[United States]], the whole school is typically run on a system of units&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usastudyguide.com/unitsystem.htm|title=USA GPA and Academic Units|website=www.usastudyguide.com|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where each subject has the same number of lessons per cycle and subjects are placed into 'lines'. This also makes timetabling easy.

In countries, such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and most [[Europe]]an countries, there generally exists a combination of the variants above, and timetables can be extremely difficult to construct. The process can take weeks of effort and typically computers are needed in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Educational/Administration_and_School_Management/Scheduling_Utilities/|title=DMOZ - Computers: Software: Educational: Administration and School Management: Scheduling Utilities|author=|date=|work=DMOZ.org|access-date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems and issues==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
The task of constructing a high school timetable&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://notesread.com/importance-of-the-school-time-table/|title=6 Importance of the School Time Table You Must Know|date=2016-11-30|work=Notes Read|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves the following issues (not an exhaustive list):
* Some schools assign the same number of periods to all subjects, but more commonly (at least outside USA) there are a variety of lengths of classes: 9 periods per cycle, 8, 7, 5 and so on. If this is the case, it means that it's not possible to have a 'coherent' structure to the timetable. 'Coherent' means that the classes in each year match up neatly with classes in other years in school-wide 'super-columns'. Non coherent timetables are much more difficult to construct.
* Occasionally there is 'vertical integration': a class from one year has a requirement to line up with a particular class from the next year. This happens mainly when students are allowed to take subjects in a higher not teach on those periods.
* Part-time teachers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asti.ie/pay-and-conditions/non-permanent-teachers/what-contract-do-you-have/regular-part-time-teacher/|title=ASTI: Regular part-time teacher|website=www.asti.ie|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; need to have certain entire days off. They will either specify to the school which weekdays they are or simply how many days per cycle they need off. Such teachers can greatly add to the difficulty of timetabling when they are assigned to large blocks.
* Sometimes two schools try to coordinate their timetables in order to be able to share a small number of staff. Often the schools have different bell times. Often also there is travel time between campuses which must be taken into consideration.
* Sometimes a school is spread over two or more campuses, and the timetable should minimise the amount of cross-campus travel for students and teachers. Furthermore, where travel occurs, the travel time must be taken into consideration.
* Sometimes there are constraints imposed from external organizations, such as sports venues bookings or technical education for senior students.
* Sometimes there are 2 or 3 subjects which rotate between student bodies throughout the year. For example, the 8A students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/u-set-college-students-set-college-students-straight-average-chapter-2.2-problem-8a-solution-9780321828019-exc|title=Chegg.com|website=www.chegg.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; might take Art in the first half of the year and Music in the second half.
* Classes should be assigned rooms in a way which attempts to give the same room to the same class (for primary schools) or the same room to the same teacher (for most high schools/secondary schools) for all or most lessons ('room constancy').
* Sometimes it is unavoidable to have what is known as a 'split class': this is a class where one teacher takes it for some lessons and another teacher for other lessons. This can happen e.g. because no single teacher is available on all scheduled periods, or because no single teacher can take it without going over their maximum teaching load.&lt;br /&gt;Another definition for a split class is when a teacher must teach two different grade levels in one period (for example Grade 10 French and Grade 11 French). This often occurs with less popular subjects, which are not big enough to be made into separate classes. Split classes are generally deemed highly undesirable.
* Off-timetable lessons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://practicalaction.org/schools|title=STEM, Science and D&amp;T resources {{!}} Schools {{!}} Practical Action|website=practicalaction.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;: sometimes an occasional lesson is scheduled "off the timetable" meaning before school or after school or during lunch. This usually happens with older students. It can be a desperate response to intractable timetabling problems or a compromise reached in order for the school to be able to offer less popular subjects.

==Elective lines==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
A central issue which exists both in the American model (all lessons in all year-levels are organised into lines) and the European model (containing all the complexities listed above) is to provide an individualised curriculum for each student that provides for his/her strengths, weaknesses and personal preferences. Certain subjects lend themselves to setting, or organising students into ability groups. Mathematics is a good example, where some students in the same age range may be years ahead of their peers. There are other subjects where students benefit from placement in mixed ability groups. This is an ongoing debate amongst teachers.

It is widely believed{{By whom|date=February 2017}} that students should have a broad curriculum in their early years at school but that it should become increasingly specialised and deeper as they get older.

Thus, many secondary schools introduce "options" or "electives", typically at the age of 14. This presents the timetabler with many restrictions, since in any one teaching period several different subject specialists will be teaching that group of students. This is in contrast to the example above – Mathematics – where the same group will all be taught by mathematics specialists.

The terminology used in Australia is: 'class' is a group of students numbering typically 25 or less students, who will study the subject together. 'Classes' are arranged into 'lines' such that all the classes within one line will run at the same times.  A 'course' may have 1 class or may have more, and if it has more, these classes can be in the same line or in different lines. Terminology in USA is: 'section' instead of 'class' and 'block' instead of 'line'.

There are many schools that fix their option blocks such that students must choose one subject in each block. This is a very poor way of approaching the problem, although in small schools staffing restrictions make it essential.

In larger schools, there is usually sufficient flexibility in staffing to allow students a free choice and staffing can then be adjusted accordingly. Large schools have the additional advantage that they can offer a wider range of subjects including those that only small numbers of students select.

The downside is that the bigger a school becomes, the less intimate it becomes. In a school of 300 students, it is reasonable to suppose that every individual student and teacher can "know" each other. In a school of 1,500 or more, this is practically impossible. A fair compromise is in the range of 700-1200.

For the timetabler, once the number of lessons for each subject are agreed, (The Curriculum) the sets and option blocks are the first thing to establish and fix. These can be thought of as stones in a river, and once fixed, the rest of the timetable flows around these mainly unmoveable lumps. This is especially true with courses that last more than one year, where it is preferable to have continuity with the same group and the same teacher.

Constructing a secondary school timetable is complex but is more a problem of persistence than intelligence. In the long process it requires thousands of decisions, some of which are obscure in the extreme. Retaining flexibility as that process develops is the key issue.

Constructing a large secondary school’s timetable is not simply a case of filling in a matrix, difficult though that often is. The timetable determines the movements of many hundreds of people for a year of their lives. All timetables are compromises between a myriad of differing interests and preferences. It requires an intimate knowledge of the detail of the lives of that community. It is not firstly a mathematical or organisational problem, it is a human one.

==Abbreviations==
In the United States «TTh» (or sometimes «TTH» or «T-TH») and «MW» or «M-W» are used as unofficial short-hands for «Tuesdays and Thursdays» and «Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays».&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=College Writing Course Policies|url=https://www.umass.edu/writingprogram/112/policies.html|website=UMass Amherst|access-date=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ivers|first1=Karen S.|title=A teacher's guide to using technology in the classroom|date=2003|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|location=Westport, CT|isbn=9781591580744|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=rNZqcorndGwC&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;ots=gKN1BXY_Jo&amp;dq=tth%20mw&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q=tth%20mw&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are utilized when columns need to be very narrow on tables where the extra characters would create an unintended new row or other unwanted formatting issues. In many colleges in the US the standard three credit semester course meets either on Monday, Wednesday and Friday or on Tuesday and Thursday. The former is often written in schedule bulletins as simply MWF, the latter TTh. The version with a hyphen (T-TH) can be confusing as the hyphen means inclusive whereas a comma creates a list. For example, M-F means Monday through Friday, but T, TH means Tuesday and Thursday only.

'''High schools in Myanmar''' ({{lang-my|အစိုးရအထက်တန်းကျောင်း}}) are operated by the [[Department of Basic Education]] under the [[Ministry of Education (Myanmar)|Ministry of Education in Myanmar]]. The present education system has not changed since the re-opening of the schools in 1989, under the [[SLORC]]. After the collapse of [[socialist]] regime, the DBE updated the high schools education system that most of the study syllabus based in socialism were withdrawn and new version was introduced. Government high schools are now known as Basic Education High Schools (abbreviated BEHS), not State High Schools (SHS). The 9th Standard is regarded as the year one of the high school or Grade 10, and 10th Standard is the year two of the high school or Grade 11, where matriculation exams are held. At that time, matriculation exams covered both syllabus from the year one and the year two high school courses. Students who pass the matriculation exams are eligible to enter any universities and institutes according to their choices and total exam scores. Most teachers in Burmese schools are underpaid but some teachers seek high earnings from their private tuitions; an estimated 50 to 80% of students take private tuition classes apart from school lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Growing Up Under the Burmese Dictatorship |url=http://www.icftu.org/www/PDF/report_burmachildren_2003.pdf  |year=2003 |publisher=International Confederation of Free Trade Unions |accessdate=2010-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uniform==
Colour code of the high schools' uniform is white top and green bottom, although some girls' uniforms are mixed designed. From basic Primary schools to High schools, the uniform with this colour code is designed for students and teachers.

==Syllabus==
[[Image:Boarding school students in Maymyo, Burma.png|thumb|200px| Grade 11 Students in hundreds lined in front of their boarding school in [[Maymyo]]]]
High schools students choose one of 2 tracks upon entering high school: science or arts. Science-specialized students have six major subjects: [[Myanmar]], [[English language|English]], [[Mathematics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Physics]] and [[Biology]]. Arts-specialized students take six major subjects: [[Myanmar]], English, [[Mathematics]], [[Geography]], [[History]] and [[Economics]]. The student life in Myanmar is much oppressed [[anti-Democratic Thought|non-democratic]] if compared to the western student cultures. Most boarding schools accept more than 500 students per year. At today's context, boarding schools are quite competitive with each other, even creating some under-table enrolling culture [[black economy]] in the education market of [[Burma]].

==Examinations==
{{main|University Entrance Examination}}

Students in all schools, including government schools, comprehensive schools and private boarding schools take the [[University Entrance Examination]] ({{my|တက္ကသိုလ်ဝင်တန်း စာမေးပွဲ}}), commonly referred to as the [[matriculation]] exam in English, administered by the [[Myanmar Board of Examinations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Announcement for submitting matriculation exam applications |newspaper=The New Light of Myanmar |date=2007-09-14 |url=http://myanmargeneva.org/NLM2007/eng/9Sep/n070914.pdf |accessdate=2010-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428013548/http://myanmargeneva.org/NLM2007/eng/9Sep/n070914.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students from government high schools and comprehensive schools can register for the examinations internally by the guidelines of school teachers, although students from private boarding schools have to register for the exams externally themselves. Students who attend international English-language schools or other private schools are not eligible to sit for the matriculation exam, nor are they allowed to enroll in Burmese universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burma Considers Private Education |newspaper=The Irrawaddy |date=2009-11-18 |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17243&amp;page=2 |accessdate=2010-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005133356/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17243&amp;page=2 |archivedate=2010-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

In the meantime, comprehensive schools are developed as only minority rich families can afford to enroll their children. Schools in Yangon such as [[TTC Yangon]], [[Dagon-1]] and Kamayut-2 are among the most infamous high-fee-accepting schools. Those students who can afford boarding schools have to pay as high as 5 millions [[kyat]]s a year for an overall care of a student (including accommodation, health care and food). Poor students from sub-urban districts cannot afford the high education fees, and thus, critics argue Myanmar education system is most unfair. People hope there will be a fairer education system in the future so that parents will no longer need to spend extra cash to send their children to the expensive schools. Currently, a dispute rises in Myanmar education system when the government enacted against school teachers teaching private tuition.

"'''Secrets of a Successful Marriage'''" is the twenty-second and final episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 5)|fifth season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 19, 1994. In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] fears he may be a little slow, so he goes to the [[adult education]] center. While there, he decides to teach a class of his own on the secrets of a successful marriage, since that is the only class he is qualified to teach. However, to keep his students interested, he is forced to tell personal secrets about his wife [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], which she dislikes, leading up to Homer getting kicked out of the house.

The episode was written by [[Greg Daniels]] and directed by [[Carlos Baeza]]. It features cultural references to the plays ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' and ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', and the films ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]'', ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]'', ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', and ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''. The episode has been analyzed in books such as ''[[Leaving Springfield]]'' and ''Education in Popular Culture''. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 9.8, and was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

==Plot==
After [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] realizes that he is "slow", [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] recommends that he take an adult education course at the annex center. Down at the center, however, Homer changes his mind and decides to become a teacher. He talks to the administrator and accepts an opening to teach a class on having a successful marriage. Despite being confident that he can pull it off, he is frightened on his first day and is unable to help his pupils with their relationship problems. The class collectively gets up to leave, but when Homer mentions his conversation with Marge in bed, the class decides to stay, eager to hear gossip. Marge soon discovers that everyone in town knows her personal secrets, reacting by confronting Homer about it and he promises to stop. He instead continues telling her secrets anyway. Homer then takes the night off teaching class by having his class observe the family over dinner.

Marge finally loses her temper and sends Homer and the class out of the house. When Homer tries to get back in, Marge stops him, saying she can no longer trust him, and refuses to let him back in. Homeless, Homer stays in [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s treehouse. Marge tries to reassure Bart and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] that she and Homer love the kids, despite their current situation, but Lisa and Bart are worried their parents will get divorced. Marge tries to get advice from [[Reverend Lovejoy]], who tells her to get a divorce.

While Homer longs for his wife, [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] comes by the Simpsons' house to declare his interest in Marge, who turns him down. When Homer comes into the house with flowers he picked for Marge, Moe sees him and jumps out the window. Standing before her in rags, Homer professes his total and utter dependency on Marge, and she tells him that isn't a good thing, but Homer then makes his winning argument: he loves her, he needs her to love him, and can't afford to ever lose her trust again or he will end up dead. Marge is won over and allows Homer to return to the house. The family is glad that he has returned, although Moe is less than thrilled.

==Production==
[[File:Davidmirkin.jpg|thumb|[[David Mirkin]] was the episode's executive producer. |alt=A seated man wearing a cap smiles as he looks into the distance. His hands are crossed.]]
The episode was written by [[Greg Daniels]] and directed by [[Carlos Baeza]]. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer "wasn't good at anything", so he tried to figure out something Homer was really good at, and he came up with the idea of Homer being a good husband.&lt;ref name="Daniels"&gt;{{cite video |people=Daniels, Greg |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner [[David Mirkin]] commented: "Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ay, Caramba!

He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all people stay together even if they argue, "there's some sort of connection".&lt;ref name="Mirkin"&gt;{{cite video |people=Mirkin, David |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
Homer sings the end of the theme song to ''[[Family Ties]]'' while talking to an administrator at the annex center. [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]]'s recollection of his marriage parodies the two plays ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' and ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', both written by American playwright [[Tennessee Williams]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Homer's bedroom rant to Marge is a parody mishmash of four popular films: ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]'' (1979), ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' (1970), and ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974). He says: "Look Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one out there every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order. The whole freaking system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown," all of which are lines from those films.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997|p=130}}

==Analysis==
[[File:Tennessee Williams NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|180px|In a reference to [[Tennessee Williams]]'s most famous plays, Smithers is shown in a flashback to have split up with his wife because he devoted too much time to his boss Mr. Burns, causing his sexual orientation to come into question.]]
It was revealed in a flashback in the episode that Smithers was briefly married to a woman, but the two split up when he devoted too much time to his boss [[Mr. Burns]]. Smithers's relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running joke on ''The Simpsons''. His sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a "Burns-sexual" and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is, without a doubt, gay.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=296}}&lt;ref name="Burns-sexual"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers |accessdate=2007-10-24 |date=2007-07-26 |author=Carroll, Larry |publisher=MTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220140402/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |archivedate=2007-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Henry wrote in the book ''[[Leaving Springfield]]'' that this episode is "perhaps the best" example of an attempt to portray an actual gay lifestyle on the show. Henry added that the flashback is a "wonderfully rendered parody of scenes from two of Tennessee Williams's most famous plays, ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' and ''A Streetcar Named Desire''. To fully appreciate it, one must know something of not only the two plays cited but also of Williams himself, of his own struggles with both [[bisexual|heterosexual and homosexual]] desires and the way in which these struggles were incorporated into his art. The creators of ''The Simpsons'' offer what I think is a perfect parallel for the relationship between Smithers and Mr. Burns by combining Williams's two most notable male characters and their defining characteristics: the suppressed homosexual desire of Brick and desperate dependence of [[Stanley Kowalski|Stanley]]."&lt;ref name="alberti"&gt;{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Matthew |editor=John Alberti |title=[[Leaving Springfield|Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture]] |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |year=2004 |page=235 |chapter=Looking for Amanda Hugginkiss: Gay Life on The Simpsons |isbn=0-8143-2849-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''Education in Popular Culture'', Alma Harris, Roy Fisher, Ann Harris, and Christine Jarvis analyzes the [[adult education]] aspects of this episode that portrays adult learners as "stupid and lazy". After Homer is appointed as a teacher, he feels immensely proud and boasts to all his acquaintances about it, initially making it seem like if the show is indicating that adult education tutors have a relatively high status in society. "However," the authors added, "Homer's pride is undercut for the audience by the awareness of how he came to be appointed and by the subsequent representation of the adult education center. It seems that anyone can become a tutor. [...] Homer's fellow tutors are drunks, incompetents and down-and-outs, adult education is therefore presented as an amateur business staffed by the dregs of society." The writers of the book thought the whole idea of storytelling and building on experience that Homer uses, and that many adult education tutors uses in real life, is represented in the episode "simply as an excuse for gossip and prurient curiosity". They also thought that statements like "I can't believe I paid ten thousand dollars for this course. What the heck was the lab fee for?" imply that adult education is "exploitative and poor value for money, and that the students themselves contribute to this by demanding an essentially recreational service." The authors concluded that the episode "certainly sustains a popular view of adult education as pointless and recreational. Similarly, no value whatsoever is attributed to the extensively researched, proven through practice and well-argued perspective that adult learners do best when the [[curriculum]] builds on and values their experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Alma Harris |author2=Roy Fisher |author3=Ann Harris |author4=Christine Jarvis |title=Education in Popular Culture |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |pages=163–164 |chapter=School for grown-ups |isbn=978-0-415-33242-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" finished forty-third in the ratings for the week of May 16 to May 22, 1994, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 9.8. The episode was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following ''[[Melrose Place]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nielsen ratings / May 16–22 |date=1994-05-25 |page=4E |publisher=[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]] |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought it was a "confident finale" to the fifth season, which "had seen the series become progressively more surreal and self-aware."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season5/page22.shtml |title=Secrets of a Successful Marriage |accessdate=2008-04-12 |author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that he thought the episode ended the season with a "high note", and that Homer’s insensitive gossiping about his relationship "presents lots of good bits. It completes this excellent year well." Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was "This is a place of learning, not a house of hearing about things!", which Homer tells his class after they demand him to reveal more secrets about him and Marge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonfive.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season (1993) |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |date=2004-12-21 |author=Jacobson, Colin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A−, and commented that episodes focusing on the relationship between Homer and Marge can "never fail", and there are "numerous opportunities for some classic Homer-isms" in the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason5.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=2005-02-23 |author=Bromley, Patrick |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420212632/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason5.php |archivedate=2009-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Gibron of [[DVD Talk]] gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13784/simpsons-the-complete-fifth-season-the/ |title=The Simpsons&amp;nbsp;— The Complete Fifth Season |last=Gibron |first=Bill |date=December 23, 2004 |publisher=[[DVD Talk]] |accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; One-time ''Simpsons'' writer and comedian [[Ricky Gervais]] named "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" his fifth favorite episode of the show, and commented that Homer's line to Marge, "I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence," is "so sweet, because he's right!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1176431,00.html |title=Best in D'oh |last=Snierson |first=Dan |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=2008-11-18 |date=2006-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was placed at number seven on ''[[MSNBC]]'''s top ten ''The Simpsons'' episodes list. They felt the episode embodied Homer's qualities of being "stupid, good-natured and mildly pathetic, [...] from his conversations with his brain [...] to his final proclamation that the one thing he can give Marge that no one else can is 'complete and utter dependence'."&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Enwright |title=D’Oh!

The '''Talpiot College of Education''' (המכללה האקדמית תלפיות) is a religious [[teacher training college]] in [[Holon]], Israel. It prepares teachers “in the spirit of the ''[[Mamlachti dati]]'' (state religious) education system”.

It was founded in 1937 by Jacob Alishkovsky and was originally called the "Talpiot ''[[Beit Midrash]]'' for [[Kindergarten]] Teachers".

The college is accredited by the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]] and offers specialized [[Bachelor of Education]] degrees in the following tracks: early childhood; elementary school; secondary school; [[special education]]; [[educational counseling]].

The college established [[Midreshet Aviv]] in 1998 as an institution of [[Torah Study]] “''lishma''” (for its own sake). [[Midreshet Binat]] is also associated with the college.

==Midreshet Aviv==
'''Midreshet Aviv''' is a [[Midrasha]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. It was founded in 1996 by Rabbi Yaakov Ariel,&lt;ref name=TOI&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/a-tel-aviv-school-for-religious-women-soldiers-on/ A Tel Aviv school for religious women soldiers on]&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with the Talpiot College of Education. Midreshet Aviv's goal is to cater to the small orthodox community in Tel Aviv,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Features/Jewish-learning-on-the-rise-in-Tel-Aviv Jewish learning on the rise in Tel Aviv]&lt;/ref&gt; with a focus on the girls who want to strengthening their religious knowledge and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/08/2009/tel_avivs_religious_renaissance/ Tel Aviv’s Religious Renaissance]&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2013}} the school had 400 students.&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt;

The Midrasha offers several programs. 
*A full program of [[Torah study]].
*A program allowing students to combine their religious studies with other interests.
*A program for women aged 22–23 with previous backgrounds in Torah study.
*A program aimed at specialization in the therapy based professions, intended to allow practitioners to introduce Torah based techniques to their professions.

The Midrasha and its students are continuously involved with community based work centred in Tel Aviv, an opportunity to strengthen Torah values in the [[Gush Dan]] area.

'''''Tom Clancy's ruthless.com''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]] based on [[Tom Clancy's Power Plays]] novel "ruthless.com". It was published [[1998 in video gaming|in 1998]] by [[Red Storm Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/tomclancysruthlesscom/index.html Gamespot entry]&lt;/ref&gt; ''ruthless.com'' puts the player in the position of CEO of a new [[software company]].  The game features a campaign mode, six different scenarios of varying difficulty, and a multiplayer option.

== Overview ==
This is a game of economic intrigue and corporate maneuvering. As the new CEO of a software company, players must scheme and strategize, form and break alliances, undertake sometimes criminal actions and do whatever it takes to get the company to the top and keep it there.

Playing in a board-game-like environment, players can choose to play any of six individual scenarios or a full campaign. The scenarios each have fundamentally different parameters. Players at an advanced point in the action with opposing corporations already established and a small history already in place.

The campaign is more freeform and the player with only one building and three departments with no immediate opponents. While objectives vary for the scenarios, in the campaign game the player must control seventy-five percent of the market for four turns.

Setting up a game involves determining how long is it going to last—between 20, 40 or 60 turns. You also choose the level of AI you wish to play against, novice, intermediate or expert. Lastly, players can set their own difficulty level that indicates how far they can go into debt before losing (bankruptcy). On the easy setting, players can incur debt up to $10,000, medium $5,000 and hardest $2,500.

Other selections include naming the corporation and selecting a CEO. Each CEO has a unique benefit that he or she brings with labels like "Talented," "Whiz Kid" or "Banker." These benefits add, as examples, five percent per level to all computer points generated (Whiz Kid) or let you go twice as deep in debt before becoming bankrupt and losing the game (Banker).

Gameplay in Tom Clancy's ruthless.com is turn-based. Each turn, you gives CEO two orders, choosing from the Corporate, R&amp;D, Marketing, Admin, Human Resources, Acquisitions, Legal, Security and Computer groups. Each group contains action orders such as "build new department" and "build new product" in the Corporate group, "executive training" in the Admin group and "assassinate executive" in the Security group.

At the end of each round, players get a comparative report that informs them on any newsworthy events such as how well (or how poorly) each company's stock prices are doing and any tragedies or executive promotions. As chosen executive(s) (you can hire more as the game progresses) gain experience, they're considered higher-level and sometimes gain additional traits (bonuses like the ones they start out with—as a Banker, Whiz Kid and so on).

Each round players attempt to acquire a larger portion of the market (represented by tiles on the game board). Doing this involves carrying out executive orders and negotiating to acquire the start-up companies that occasionally pop up around the game board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.cnet.com/Tom-Clancy-s-Ruthless-com-demo-entire-zipped-game-file/3000-2119_4-10246395.html Game synopsis by Gil Shif at Allgame.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The game takes place on a map that represents the market share of all the competing companies.  Each player in the game is a CEO of a software company.  Legal, security, and computer attacks are common in the game.  Competition comes from the fight over market shares (map squares).  A CEO builds their initial buildings and puts their product into the market.  Once on the market a product's quality will determine its dominance in the market.  Dominance in the market provides income to build additional buildings, bid for takeovers, or launch different kinds of attacks against the competitors.

== Reception ==
[[GameSpot]] reviewed the game in 1999, awarding 6.3 out of 10. Main criticisms included the shortness of the campaign, limited scenarios and lack of replayability. However, the multiplayer mode was deemed "about as much fun as turn-based multiplayer games can be". The graphics were also highlighted, with a well designed interface and inventive visuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/tomclancysruthlesscom/review.html?sid=2532860&amp;om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gsupdates&amp;tag=updates;title;1 Review] at Gamespot&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Game Revolution]], the game was awarded a B+. The gameplay, multiplayer mode and interface were praised, while the main criticisms included the start difficult and the "poorly explained manual".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/tom-clancys-ruthlesscom Review] at Gamerevolution&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8461">The '''Welsh Not''' (also '''Welsh Knot''', '''Welsh Note''', '''Welsh Stick''', '''Welsh Lead''' or '''Cwstom''') was an item used in [[Wales|Welsh]] schools in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries to stigmatise and punish children using the [[Welsh language]].

==Usage==
{{quote box|

''"Endeavoured to compel the children to converse in English by means of a piece of wood. Offenders to be shut in after school hours."''

|source=Extracts from the Llansantffraid board school log book.
8th February, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welsh Not |url=https://pilgrim.ceredigion.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|align=right|width=40%}}
Typically "The Not" was a piece of wood, a ruler or a stick, often inscribed with the letters "WN". This was given to the first pupil to be heard speaking Welsh. When another child was heard using Welsh, "The Not" was taken from its current holder and given to the latest offender. Whoever was in possession of "The Not" was encouraged to pass it on to any of their Welsh-speaking classmates by informing the teacher that they had caught someone else speaking Welsh. The pupil in possession at the end of the day was subjected to a [[flogging]] or other punishment (some reports suggest the punishment was administered at the end of the week, or at the end of each lesson).&lt;ref name="BBC not"/&gt;

===Effects===
The effect of "The Not" was to stigmatise the use of the Welsh language among children, and engender the idea that [[English language|English]], as the preferable [[medium of instruction]], was the language of moral progress and opportunity.

Although this was never official government policy, the practice and wider social changes of the nineteenth century saw many Welsh speakers come to view the speaking of Welsh as a disadvantage.&lt;ref name="BBC not"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/language_education.shtml|title=Welsh and 19th century education|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{quote box|

''"Cannot get the children from the habit of talking in Welsh; the school as a whole is backward in English."''

|source=Extracts from the log book of the British School, Aberaeron. Written by the head teacher.
5th November, 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welsh Not |url=https://pilgrim.ceredigion.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|align=left|width=40%}}
===Origin===
The use of "The Not" was recorded as early as the 18th century, and there is strong evidence of numerous incidents in both Anglican and Nonconformist schools throughout [[Carmarthen]], [[Ceredigion]] and [[Meirionnydd]], it was commonly known as the 'cwstom', the 'Welsh stick' or the 'Welsh lead' (if a lump of [[lead]] was used).&lt;ref&gt;The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Widespread Use and Cultural Impact===
{{quote box|

''"Among other injurious effects, this custom has been found to lead children to visit stealthily the houses of their school-fellows for the purpose of detecting those who speak Welsh to their parents, and transferring to them the punishment due to themselves."''

|source=Extracts from Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Education in Wales, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Education in Wales. |date=1847 |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/reportsofcommiss00greaiala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|align=right|width=40%}}
The most frequent use of the Welsh Not in schools appears to be in the first decades following the publication of the government's [[Treachery of the Blue Books|Reports of the commissioners of enquiry into the state of education in Wales]] in 1847.

The reports noted that schools in Wales were inadequate, with English monoglot teachers and English textbooks in use in areas where the children spoke only Welsh. It concluded that the Welsh as a race were "ignorant", "lazy" and "immoral", and that one of the main causes of this was the continuing use of the "evil" Welsh language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Education in Wales. |date=1847 |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/reportsofcommiss00greaiala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reports had great influence in Wales, becoming known as ''Brad y Llyfrau Gleision'' (the Treachery of the Blue Books) among Welsh speakers, and supporting the removal of Welsh as a moral endeavour. In linking the Welsh language with low educational standards and poor morality, the report also highlighted the effective use of the "Welsh Not" and, while it did not officially endorse it's use, it popularised the method as an effective tool for educators throughout Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://digidol.llgc.org.uk/METS/SEW00004b/frames?part=body&amp;div=19&amp;locale=en&amp;mode=reference|title=Reports of the commissioners of enquiry into the state of education in Wales|chapter=Part 3: North Wales, comprising Anglesey, Carnarvon, Denbigh, Flint, Meirioneth and Montgomery - Report|page=19|author=|year=1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later Use===

''"The speaking of Welsh in school was strictly forbidden; any boy or girl guilty of the offence was given the Welsh Not, which he or she handed on to the next offender, the unfortunate one who held the Welsh Not at the end of the school session becoming the scapegoat who bore the punishment for the sins of all. Mother, being a lively child, was in frequent possession of the Welsh Not, but was never allowed to pay the penalty; a chivalrous boy cousin always asked for it in Welsh and took the punishment himself."''

The use of the "Welsh Not" appears to have decreased with the introduction of [[compulsory education]] in the later decades of the 19th century. After the [[School board (England &amp; Wales)|school boards]] were absorbed by the [[county councils]] following the [[Local Government Act 1888]], instruction in Welsh became the norm in [[primary schools]] in Welsh-speaking areas. However, incidents of the "Welsh Not" were still reported.&lt;ref&gt;John Davies, ''A History of Wales'', Penguin, 1994, {{ISBN|0-14-014581-8}}, p 455&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Morgan Edwards]] describes his experience of the Welsh Not in school in [[Llanuwchllyn]] in his book ''Clych Atgof''.

[[Susan Jones]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Clwyd South (UK Parliament constituency)|Clwyd South]], claimed in 2010 that the use of the Welsh Not, including [[caning]] as the punishment, persisted in some schools in her constituency until "as recently as the 1930s and 1940s".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/comment/newsid_8734000/8734105.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=A bevy of maidens|date=29 June 2010|last=Lowther|first=Ed|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman in a village in [[Wrexham Maelor]] stated that the Welsh Not was in use in her school in the 1940s. In 2018 Gwyn James, then living in another Wrexham Maelor village, and a monoglot Welsh speaker as a child, was reported to have had the board placed around his neck in school in the 1930s for not using English in the classroom.

'''Youth Volunteer Corps,'''(YVC), is a non-profit service organization operating throughout the United States and Canada that was created to introduce, encourage, and support the spirit of volunteerism in youth ages 11 to 18 through consistent, well-organized volunteer opportunities. It began in 1987 as a single organization in Kansas City, Missouri, sponsored by the Heart of America United Way and was funded by numerous public and private sources.

Since then YVC has grown to dozens of affiliated sites in the United States and Canada, sponsored locally by diverse community-based organizations such as Volunteer Centers, [[YMCA]], [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Clubs]], [[Camp Fire (organization)|Camp Fire]], [[United Way of America|United Way]], City Parks &amp; Recreation, and school districts. Funding is provided by foundations, corporations, individuals, United Way, and both the local and federal government.

==Mission statement and goals==
Mission: “We create volunteer opportunities to address community needs and to inspire youth for a lifetime commitment to service.”
&lt;br /&gt;
The stated goals of YVC are:
# To engage young people in service projects that are challenging, rewarding and educational.
# To serve the unmet needs of the community and its residents.
# To promote among youth a greater understanding and appreciation for the diversity of their community.
# To promote a lifetime ethic of service among youth.

Examples of projects include:
* Serving meals to the homeless
* Constructing and restoring trails
* AIDS education and outreach
* Organizing recycling programs
* Assisting kids with disabilities
* Removing graffiti
* Painting murals
* Tutoring elementary school children
* Performing skits for children
* Renovating sub-standard housing
* Assisting local animal shelters

==Fundamental components==
YVC is a membership organization where affiliates (or local YVC sites), are provided with training, fundraising opportunities, support and programming. The program consists of two fundamental components:

'''Summer Component:''' Youth volunteer on extended projects throughout the summer, allowing for the opportunity to see larger outcomes and accomplishments. Youth are a part of a team supervised by trained adult Team Leaders where they learn teamwork, appreciation for diversity and civic responsibility.

'''School-Year Component:''' Youth serve as teams during the school year service projects after school and on weekends. Additionally, YVC program directors, team leaders and staff work with teachers to design and implement age-appropriate service projects that tie school curriculum to community service.

==History==
As part of his college senior thesis project research in 1985, YVC President David Battey interviewed leaders in the newly forming youth service field. He found that while service opportunities were sporadically available through schools, churches and synagogues, a broad-based community organization offering challenging, organized service opportunities to youth of all ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds was not consistently available.

Developing a framework for such an organization, Battey returned to his hometown of Kansas City and established the Youth Volunteer Corps of Greater Kansas City under the sponsorship of Heart of America United Way and with funding from public and private sources.
