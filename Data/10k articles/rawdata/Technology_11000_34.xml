'''''A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland''''' discusses the lives of the people who were concerned with building [[harbour]]s and [[lighthouse]]s, undertook [[fen drainage]] and improved [[river navigation]]s, built [[canal]]s, [[road]]s, [[bridge]]s and early [[railway]]s, and provided water supply facilities. Volume One, published in 2002, covers the years from 1500 to 1830, while Volume Two, published in 2008, covers 1830 to 1890. The principal editor of the first volume was Professor [[Alec Skempton|A. W. Skempton]], and the entries were written by a number of specialist historians.

An 18-page introduction in the first volume discusses the practice of [[civil engineer]]ing from 1500-1830. The work concludes with appendices discussing wages, costs and inflation, a chronology of major civil engineering works, and indices of places and names. Volume Two's introduction discusses the practice of civil engineering from 1830-1890.

'''Avery Dennison Corporation''' is a global manufacturer and distributor of [[pressure-sensitive adhesive]] materials (such as self-adhesive labels), apparel branding labels and tags, RFID inlays, and specialty medical products.  The company is a member of the [[Fortune 500]] and is headquartered in Glendale, California.

==History==
[[File:MODODennison.jpg|thumb|left|Dennison Mending Tape from the second half of the 20th century.]]
The company was founded in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in 1935 as '''Kum Kleen Products''', a partnership of Mr. and Mrs. [[R. Stanton Avery|Ray Stanton Avery]].  The name was changed to '''Avery Adhesives''' in 1937.  In 1946, the company was incorporated as '''Avery Adhesive Label Corp.''', and the name was subsequently changed to '''Avery Adhesive Products, Inc.''' in 1958, and to '''Avery Products Corporation''' in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Avery Products Corporation. 1964 Annual Report, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name was changed again to '''Avery International Corporation''' in 1976, and it became '''Avery Dennison''' after the company merged with the Dennison Manufacturing Company in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategic Report|url=http://economics-files.pomona.edu/jlikens/SeniorSeminars/PAC2004/Drafts/avery.pdf|work=Avery Dennison, PAC Consulting|publisher=PAC Consulting|accessdate=28 May 2012|page=3|date=19 Apr 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dennison Manufacturing===
The '''Dennison Manufacturing Company''' was founded by Andrew Dennison and his son [[Aaron Lufkin Dennison]], residents of Brunswick. Maine, in 1844, as a [[jewelry]]- and [[watch]]-box manufacturing company located in the Dunlap Block of Maine Street.  Five years later Aaron turned the Dennison Manufacturing Company over to his younger brother, [[Eliphalet Whorf Dennison]], who took over and developed the company into a significant-size industrial enterprise. It was in 1898 that the business moved to a location in Framingham, Massachusetts. (Aaron Dennison went on to co-found the [[Waltham Watch Company]] in 1850, a leader in the [[American system of watch manufacturing]] using interchangeable parts.)

===Office and Consumer Products===
Avery Dennison created a separate division for office products such as binders, file labels and name badges in 1982. The division and its products, sold under the Avery brand and logo, contrasted with the company’s larger materials division in that its products were finished (“converted”) materials, and they were aimed at consumers as well as businesses. Over the next 30 years, the division grew, as personal computing created a market for printable media both at home and at work. However, with the rise of email and the decline in conventional mail, the office products market as a whole began to decline. On July 1, 2013, Avery Dennison completed the sale of Office and Consumer Products and a second business, Designed and Engineered Solutions, to CCL Industries. CCL purchased the Avery office products brand along with the business. Avery Dennison retains its full name, history, brand and logo.

==Operations==
The company is headquartered in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], California. It ranked number 435 on the 2015 [[Fortune 500]] list with total sales of $7.0 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://beta.fortune.com/fortune500/avery-dennison-435 | title=Fortune 500 list | publisher=Fortune Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main lines of business are pressure-sensitive materials (contributing 73% of 2015 revenues) and retail branding and information solutions (contributing 26% of 2015 revenues).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investors.averydennison.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=97892&amp;p=irol-reportsAnnual | title=2015AnnualReport }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company operates in more than 50 countries and employs 25,000 people worldwide.&lt;ref name=InvestorFAQs/&gt; Its first overseas subsidiary was established in the [[Netherlands]] in 1955.

==Divisions==

The company's operations are organized into three business units:

The '''Pressure-Sensitive Materials''' segment manufactures and sells pressure-sensitive roll-label materials, films for graphic applications, reflective highway-safety products, a variety of specialized tapes, performance polymers, and extruded films.

Printers take its label materials, which are manufactured in large rolls, and convert them into finished labels by printing, cutting and applying them to packaging for consumer goods such as shampoo, beverages and pharmaceuticals.

The '''Retail Branding and Information Solutions''' segment designs, manufactures, and sells various branding and information management products and [[solution]]s for apparel and general retail, including tickets, graphic, barcode and [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) tags, labels and inserts, woven and printed labels, external embellishments, price management systems, a variety of fasteners, and related supplies and equipment.

The information management products that the business provides, including its RFID-based systems, help apparel and other retailers to manage inventory both within stores and across supply chains that today extend for thousands of miles. The ability to accurately identify inventory and replenish it can help improve the shopping experience, as goods are less likely to be out of stock.

The company also operates '''Vancive Medical Technologies''', which provides products such as wearable sensors, barrier films, wound dressings and a variety of tapes and securement products for the healthcare industry.  Results for Vancive Medical Technologies are reported in Other specialty converting businesses. Vancive Medical Technologies products are sold to medical products and device manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Summary|url=http://averydennison.com/en/home/our-company/business-summary.html|work=Avery Dennison, Business Summary|publisher=Avery Dennison|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patent infringement==

In 2012, Avery Dennison and 3M Company agreed to settle patent and antitrust litigation between the parties. The litigation began when 3M alleged that Avery Dennison infringed 3M's patents related to retroreflective sheeting used for road signs and other highway and transportation products and requested an injunction to prevent Avery Dennison from selling its OmniCube retroreflective product. The court denied 3M's request, and after Avery Dennison brought claims of its own against 3M for patent infringement and antitrust violations, the parties agreed to dismiss three pending cases.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

'''Ball transfer units''' are omnidirectional load-bearing [[spherical]] [[ball]]s mounted inside a restraining [[fixture (tool)|fixture]]. They are identical in principle to a computer [[trackball]] (pointing device). Typically the design involves a single large ball supported by smaller ball bearings. 

They are commonly used in an inverted ball up position where objects are quickly moved across an array of units, known as a ball transfer table, a type of [[conveyor system]]. This permits manual transfer to and from machines and between different sections of another [[conveyor system]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ise.ncsu.edu/kay/mhetax/PosEq/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in [[airports]] for [[luggage]] delivery, or in industry as part of manufacturing systems. Prior to the invention of the ball transfer unit, first patented by Autoset Production Ltd in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omnitrack.co.uk/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; these applications were solved by the use of inverted [[casters]]. However, casters recognise a trail, meaning that the wheels had to align before directional change could be achieved.

Ball transfer units can also be used in a non-inverted ball down position as a type of caster, however this use is restricted by load-bearing limitations and the type of floor. Manufacturers have addressed this problem with ball transfer units incorporating [[recirculating ball]] principles, however the inverted position is still the most common application and the least problematic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">A '''blind mate connector''' is differentiated from other types of connectors by the mating action that happens via a sliding or snapping action which can be accomplished without wrenches or other tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.connectpositronic.com/blind-mate-connector | title=BLIND MATE CONNECTORS | publisher=''[[Positronic (company)|Positronic]]'' | accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/connectorpush.cfm Push-on microwave connectors]&lt;/ref&gt;  They have self-aligning features which allows a small misalignment when mating.

== Usage ==
Electrical blind mate connectors provide power or signal and are distinguished from other connectors in that they do not feature a rigid mechanical retention mechanism belonging to the interface itself, such as a threaded coupling nut on an [[SMA connector]]. They are typically used in a multi-pin arrangement between racks and panels, [[daughtercard]] to [[backplane]], or similar applications where the connector is not mated by itself, but rather by the action of inserting the entire unit or module.

== Types ==
=== RF ===
Blind mate [[RF connector]]s are generally intended to be used without wrenches or other tools, but can come packaged in a multiport configuration that includes mounting hardware or provided as inserts in a [[circular connector]] such as a MIL-DTL-38999. Some examples of blind mate RF interfaces include BMA (OSP), BMMA (OSSP), SMP, SMPM, SMPS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svmicrowave.com/productOverview&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Planar Crown connector|Planar Crown connectors]].

Certain styles of blind mate [[RF connector]]s feature a detent or undercut to allow for the mating connector to snap into, improving retention. These styles are typically used when the mate is a cable connector and might see a significant force that would normally demate the connection.

Other configurations feature a smooth bore into which the mate simply slides to connect. These arrangements are more commonly found in board to board connections, where they are mated with a female to female "bullet" adapter, and no significant force is present to demate the connection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amphenolrf.com/products/smp.asp?N=0&amp;sid=538527003ABF617F&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svmicrowave.com/smp&lt;/ref&gt;

Key features of hermetic, push-on and blind-mate RF connectors are listed below:

{| class="wikitable sortable" border="1"

! RF Connector Name !! Compatibility !! Size !! Maximum Frequency!! class="unsortable" | Notes
|-
|Sub-Miniature Push-on (SMP)||PO-compatible||MIL-STD 348 compliant||26.5 GHz
|-
|Sub-Miniature Push-on Micro (SMPM)||PPO-compatible||MIL-STD 348 compliant||40 GHz
|-
|Sub-Miniature Push-on Sub-micro (SMPS)||3PO-compatible|| ||65 GHz||Small size makes SMPS the ideal choice for high density packaging and multiport applications

=== Optical ===
Optical signals can also be connected using blind mate connectors providing the capability to link fibre optics on a plug-in card to an optical backplane, or through an optical midplane&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6650468.html Optical amplifier arrangement United States Patent 6650468]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Trinity tower.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The tower used in the [[Trinity test]], 1945.]]
A '''bomb tower''' is a lightly constructed [[tower]], often 100 to 700 feet (30 to 210 meters) high, built to hold a [[nuclear weapon]] for an above ground [[nuclear testing|nuclear test]]. The tower holds the bomb for the purpose of the investigation of its destructive effects (such as [[burst height]] and distance with given [[nuclear weapon yield|explosive yield]]) and for the adjustment of measuring instruments, such as [[high-speed camera]]s. Normally, the bomb tower disintegrates completely on detonation due to the enormous heat of the explosion.

A '''bone crusher''' is a device regularly used for crushing animal bones.  Bones obtained during slaughter are cleaned, boiled in water and dried for several months.  After that, they are suitable for crushing with the special machine into a relatively dry gritty powder which is used as fertilizer.

The machine, shown in the picture, is powered by a [[water wheel]].  It contains eight S-shaped pairs of cams that raise the crushers alternately and let them fall into material to be crushed.  The simple transmission increases the rotation speed of the crusher wheel to 21 rpm from the water wheel speed of about 7 rpm.

[[Bone meal]] has been used since about 1790 as a fertilizer supplement to ordinary farmyard manure. From about 1880 onwards it was supplanted by chemical fertilizers.

'''Carl Atwood Wiley''' (December 30, 1918 – April 21, 1985) was an American mathematician and engineer. He is most widely known as the originator of the [[solar sail]] concept as well as the inventor of [[synthetic aperture radar]].

==Career==
Wiley's research work began at the [[Wright Laboratory|Air Force Aircraft Radiation Lab]] at [[Wright Field]] in 1941. In 1942 he discovered the [[piezoelectricity]] of [[Barium titanate]], for which he later was awarded a patent.&lt;ref name="memory"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=In Memory of Carl A.

It was during this time he invented [[synthetic aperture radar]] in 1951, patented as "Pulsed Doppler Radar Methods and Means," #3,196,436. That same year Wiley posited the idea of solar sails in a science fiction story published in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine entitled ''Clipper Ships of Space'' (originally titled ''Are the Clipper Ships gone forever?''). Wiley wrote his story under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' of Russel Saunders, an in-group reference to [[Russel–Saunders coupling]] not unlike [[J.J. Coupling]], itself a reference to [[angular momentum]].&lt;ref name="memory"/&gt; Seven years later [[Richard L. Garwin]] developed the first technical specifications for a solar sail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=John Noble|last1=Wilford|title=The Dream of Racing on Sunbeams|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/17/science/the-dream-of-racing-on-sunbeams.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 May 1983|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert L.

[[Image:Several Cartons.jpg|right|thumb|Examples of several types of cartons for different products]]
A '''carton''' is a box or container usually made of [[paperboard]] and sometimes of [[corrugated fiberboard]].
Many types of cartons are used in [[packaging]]. Sometimes a carton is also called a [[box]].

==Types of cartons==

===Folding cartons===
{{See also|Folding carton}}
[[Image:Reverse Tuck Carton.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Typical blank for folding carton]]
A carton is a type of [[packaging]] suitable for food, pharmaceuticals, hardware, and many other types of products. [[Folding carton]]s are usually combined into a tube at the manufacturer and shipped flat (knocked down) to the packager. Tray styles have a solid bottom and are often shipped as flat blanks and assembled by the packager. Some also are self-erecting. High-speed equipment is available to set up, load, and close the cartons.

===Egg carton===
[[Image:DFRCartons.jpg|thumb|150px|Egg cartons]]

[[Egg carton]]s or trays are designed to protect whole eggs while in transit. Traditionally, these have been made of [[molded pulp]]. This uses recycled newsprint which is molded into a shape which protects the eggs. More recently, egg cartons have also been made from [[expanded polystyrene]] and [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].

===Aseptic carton===
Cartons for liquids can be fabricated from laminates of [[liquid packaging board]], foil, and polyethylene. Most are based on either [[Tetra Pak]] or [[Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft#Packaging|SIG Combibloc]] systems. One option is to have the printed laminate supplied on a roll. The carton is cut, scored, and formed at the packager. A second option is to have the pre-assembled tubes delivered to the packager for completion and filling. These are suited for [[aseptic processing]] and are used for milk, soup, juice, etc. Paperboard-based cartons are lighter compared to a similarly-sized steel can,&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/03/09/591568093/in-the-recycling-world-why-are-some-cartons-such-a-problem In The Recycling World, Why Are Some Cartons Such A Problem?]&lt;/ref&gt; but are more difficult to recycle.  Some open-loop recycling operations pelletize or flatten ground-up cartons for use in building materials; closed-loop recycling is possible by separating the layers before processing, though some recyclers only recycle the cardboard fibers.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

===Gable top===
[[File:Meiji brand fresh cream.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Gable top carton of cream]]
Gable top cartons are often used for liquid products such as milk, juice, etc. These use [[polyethylene]]-coated paperboard or other [[liquid packaging board]] and sometimes a foil laminate. Most are opened by pushing open the gables at the top back and pulling the top (spout) out. Some have fitments to assist in opening and eating the contents.

==Packaging history==

The history of the carton goes as far back as 1879 in a Brooklyn, New York, factory operated by [[Robert Gair]]. A die-ruled, cut, and scored [[paperboard]] into a single impression of a folded carton. By 1896, the [[Nabisco|National Biscuit Company]] was the first to use cartons to package [[Cracker (food)|crackers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The packaging designer's book of patterns|publisher=Bilimsel Eserler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLhcx5ZZHUkC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Robert+Gair+and+folding+carton#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next development of folded paper used to construct cartons are mentioned by Dr. Winslow of Seattle, Washington, in 1908 who claimed that paper [[milk]] containers were commercially sold in [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]] as early as 1906. The inventor of this carton was G.W. Maxwell. However, it was in 1915 that John Van Wormer of Toledo, Ohio, was granted the first [[patent]] for the first "paper bottle," which was the first folded blank box for holding milk. He called it the "Pure-Pak." The milk carton was original in the sense that it could be folded, glued, filled with milk, and sealed at a dairy farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Food packaging: principles and practice|publisher=CRC Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFRR6GayR74C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=John+Van+Wormer+inventor+of+milk+carton#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early 1960s brought many automated systems to help with production of repeatable processes. It was at that time that an engineer from Detroit, Michigan, named Mario Lepore developed a machine to fold and seal a gable top paper carton. 

An early American packaging industry pioneer was the Kieckhefer Container Company, which was run by [[John W. Kieckhefer]]. The company excelled in the use of fibre shipping containers, which especially included the paper milk carton. In 1957, through an exchange of stock, the Kieckhefer Container Co. holdings were merged with the [[Weyerhauser]] Timber Company of [[Tacoma, Washington]].

==Shape==
[[File:Tetra Classic of milk Tomoe.jpg |right|thumb|150px|Tetrahedral carton of milk]]
Although quite often shaped like a [[cuboid]], it is not uncommon to find cartons lacking [[right angle]]s and straight edges, as in [[squround]]s used for [[ice cream]].

[[Tetrahedron]]s and other shapes are available.  Cartons with a hexagonal or octagonal cross sections are sometimes used for specialty items.

==Materials==

Cartons can be made from many materials: [[paperboard]], duplex, white kraft, recycled and many more various plastics,  or a [[Composite material|composite]].  Some are "food grade"  for direct contact with foods. Many cartons are made out of a single piece of paperboard. Depending on the need, this paperboard can be [[wax]]ed or coated with [[polyethylene]] to form a moisture barrier. This may serve to contain a liquid product or keep a powder dry.

==Environmental concerns==
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/03/09/591568093/in-the-recycling-world-why-are-some-cartons-such-a-problem In The Recycling World, Why Are Some Cartons Such A Problem?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic design==
In art history, the [[cartoon#Fine art|carton]] (pronounced the French way) was a drawing on heavy pasteboard or paperboard, used as life-size design for the manufacture in an [[atelier]] of a valuable [[tapestry]], such as a [[gobelin]]. During the weaving it hung behind the tapestry in the making, a time-consuming process thus in a creative sense simplified to 'mechanical' painting-by-numbers.

As these were extremely valuable, often commanded by the very richest art-buyers, including princes who hung them in their palaces and even took them on their travels as prestigious displays of wealth, often with a visual message, especially the world-famous Flemish ateliers were deemed worthy to have cartons made by some of the greatest graphic artists of the time, including such celebrated painters as Rubens.

In the 1980s, milk cartons in the United States often [[Photo on a milk carton|printed photos of missing children]] with the hope that someone would recognize the photograph and provide information to police.

==Carton-pierre==
''Carton-pierre'' was a material used for the making of raised ornaments for wall and ceiling decoration. It is composed of the pulp of paper mixed with whiting (ground [[calcium carbonate]]) and glue, this being forced into plaster moulds backed with paper, and then removed to a drying room to harden. It is much stronger and lighter than common plaster-of-Paris ornaments, and is not so liable to chip or break if struck with anything.

'''Collapse action''' is a device behaviour that snaps a switch into place, usually using a bistable element. When flipping a light switch, strain on one spring increases until it flips position, pulling down the switch.  Collapse action allows one to remove their hand from the switch without risk of it falling to the down position, as the force needed to overcome the resistance is too great. The action also does not exert force in the lower position, avoiding a spontaneous rise to the up position.

[[File:Comb-drive-digital-holographic-Microscopy-Holographic-MEMS-Analyzer.gif|thumb|Comb-drive vibrating in-plane measured by digital holographic microscope]]
'''Comb-drives''' are  [[actuators]], often used as [[linear actuators]] [[electrostatic]] forces that act between two electrically conductive combs.  Comb drive actuators typically operate at the micro- or nanometer scale and are generally manufactured by [[bulk micromachining]] or [[surface micromachining]] a silicon [[wafer]] substrate.

The attractive [[electrostatic]] forces are created when a [[voltage]] is applied between the static and moving combs causing them to be drawn together. The force developed by the actuator is proportional to the change in capacitance between the two combs, increasing with  driving voltage, the number of comb teeth, and the gap between the teeth. The combs are arranged so that they never touch (because then there would be no voltage difference). Typically the teeth are arranged so that they can slide past one another until each tooth occupies the slot in the opposite comb.

Restoring [[spring (device)|springs]], [[lever]]s, and [[crankshaft]]s can be added if the motor's linear operation is to be converted to rotation or other motions.

The force can be derived by first starting with the energy stored in a capacitor and then differentiating in the direction of the force.  The energy in a capacitor is given by:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial C}{\partial dx_{drive}} V^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using the capacitance for a [[Capacitor|parallel plate capacitor]], the force is:

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{-1}{2}\frac{nt\epsilon_o\epsilon_rV^2}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; = applied electric potential,     
&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; = relative permittivity of dielectric,     
&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_o&lt;/math&gt; = permittivity of free space (8.85 pF/m),&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = total number of fingers on both sides of electrodes,     
&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = thickness in the out of plane direction of the electrodes,     
&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; = gap between electrodes.

==Structure of Comb-drives==

• rows of interlocking teeth
• half fixed
• half part of movable assembly
• electrically isolated
• electrostatic attraction/ repulsion
– CMOS drive voltage
• many teeth increased force
– typically 10μm long and strong

==Scaling Issues==
Comb drives cannot scale to large gap distances (equivalently actuation distance), since development of effective forces at large gaps distances would require high voltages—therefore limited by [[electrical breakdown]]. More importantly, limitations imposed by gap distance limits the actuation distance.

==Trade shows==

===CES===
{{main |Consumer Electronics Show}}
CES is a major technology trade show held each January in Las Vegas. The CTA-sponsored show typically hosts previews of products and new product announcements.&lt;ref name="TWICE1"&gt;[http://www.twice.com/article/246418-1967_First_CES_Goes_Broadway_in_June_1967.php First CES Goes Broadway in June 1967] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515132659/http://www.twice.com/article/246418-1967_First_CES_Goes_Broadway_in_June_1967.php |date=2010-05-15 }}, Bob Gerson, ''TWICE'', August 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Comeback: How Innovation Will Restore the American Dream |last=Shapiro |first=Gary |year=2011 |publisher=Beaufort Books |isbn=0825305624  |pages= 224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first CES was held in 1967 in New York City&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/4/3828848/ces-photo-history|title=Incredible photos from the CES vault: 1967 to 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=The Verge|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was a spinoff from the Chicago Music Show&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.avadirect.com/blog/the-history-of-ces-the-consumer-electronics-show/|title=The History of CES – the Consumer Electronics Show|last=|first=|date=AV Direct|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which until then had served as the main event for exhibiting consumer electronics. The event had 17,500 attendees and over 100 exhibitors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ces.tech/News/Press-Releases/CES-Press-Release.aspx?NodeID=0f8655a3-b69e-4b3d-9ca8-6bb44933fa6f|title=50 Year Anniversary of First CES in New York|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the kickoff speaker was Motorola chairman Bob Galvin. From 1978 to 1994, CES was held twice each year: once in January in Las Vegas known as ''Winter Consumer Electronics Show'' (WCES) and once in June in Chicago, known as ''Summer Consumer Electronics Show''. In 1998, the show changed to a once-a-year format with Las Vegas as the location. CES is one of the largest and longest-running trade shows held in Las Vegas, taking up to 17 days to set up, run and break down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freemanco.com/store/show/landing?referer=s&amp;nav=02&amp;showID=467735|title=Freeman Show Schedule|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CES Asia===
CES Asia is owned and produced by the International CES (Shanghai) Exhibition Co. Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), and is co-produced by Shanghai Intex Exhibition Co., Ltd (Shanghai Intex).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cesasia.cn/about-ces-asia/|title=About CES Asia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special co-organizers for CES Asia are the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCME) and the China Electronic Chamber of Commerce (CECC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cesasia.cn/about-ces-asia/|title=About CES Asia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CES Asia serves as a platform for both Chinese and American companies to introduce new products into the Asian marketplace

== Hall of Fame ==
{{main|Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame}}

The CTA maintains a Hall of Fame, to which notable contributors to the field of consumer electronics are named.

==Name changes==
[[File:Consumer Electronics Association logo.svg|alt=This logo is still the sign on the CTA headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.|thumb|Former CTA logo, used from 1999 until 2015]]
CTA originally started as the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA) in 1924. In 1950, it changed its name to Radio-Television Manufacturers Association (RTMA). In 1953, it changed its name to Radio-Electronics-Television Manufacturers Association (RETMA). It was then the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) from 1957 to 1998, when it became the [[Electronic Industries Alliance]]. In 1995, EIA's Consumer Electronics Group (CEG) became the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA). In 1999, President Gary Shapiro announced the trade group's name change from CEMA to the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) and became an independent sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ce.org/Press/CEA_Pubs/1964.asp |title=Digital America |publisher=Consumer Electronics Association |accessdate=2007-09-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821005818/http://www.ce.org/Press/CEA_Pubs/1964.asp |archivedate=2007-08-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of CEA was changed to Consumer Technology Association (CTA) in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/nov/13/group-behind-consumer-electronics-show-is-changing/|title=Group behind Consumer Electronics Show is changing its name|publisher=''[[Las Vegas Sun]]''|date=November 13, 2015|accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2147">'''Consumer relationship systems''' ('''CRS''') are specialized [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) [[software]] applications that are used to handle a company's dealings with its customers.&lt;ref name ="Insight44-50"&gt;[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/cmp/cmi_200709/index.php ICMI Customer Management Insight Magazine, September 2007, pp 44–50], Retrieved 11 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Current consumer relationship systems integrate the [[software]] with telephone and call recording systems as well as with corporate systems for input and reporting. Customers can provide input from the company's website directly into the CRS. These systems are popular because they can deliver the 'voice of the consumer' that contributes to product quality improvement and that ultimately increases corporate profits.&lt;ref name ="Insight44-50" /&gt;

Consumer relationship systems that provide automated support as well as advanced systems may have [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) interfaces that can extract and analyse [[data]] collected, or handle basic questions and complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith| first1=S.E.|title= What is Consumer Relationship System? |date= |publisher= WiseGeek.net|url= http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-consumer-relationship-system.htm|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first CRS was developed in the 1980s. In 1981 Michael Wilke and Robert Thornton founded Wilke/Thornton, Inc in [[Columbus, Ohio]], to develop new CRS software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilke-thornton.com/WTI/Pages/products.html Wilke/Thornton, Inc Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820093347/http://www.wilke-thornton.com/WTI/Pages/products.html |date=2008-08-20 }} Retrieved 11 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5986">'''Continuous Availability''' is an approach to computer system and application design that protects users against downtime, whatever the cause and ensures that users remain connected to their documents, data files and business applications. Continuous availability describes the information technology methods to ensure [[business continuity]].&lt;ref&gt;Business Continuity: Delivering Data and Applications Through Continuous Availability, A META Group White Paper, June 2003 [http://m.sybase.com/content/1025175/BusinessContinuity_whitepaper.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In early days of computing, availability was not considered business critical. With the increasing use of [[mobile computing]], global access to online business transactions and business-to-business communication, continuous availability is increasingly important based on the need to support customer access to information systems.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner Survey Shows IT Availability Remain Top Priorities for U.S. IT Services Buyers, September 2010 [http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1392715]&lt;/ref&gt;

Solutions to continuous availability exists in different forms and implementations depending on the software and hardware manufacturer. The goal of the discipline is to reduce the user or business application downtime, which can have a severe impact on business operations. Inevitably, such downtime can lead to loss of productivity, loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction and ultimately can damage a company's reputation.

==Degrees of Availability==
The terms [[high availability]], continuous operation, and continuous availability are generally used to express how available a system is.&lt;ref&gt;High availability (again) versus continuous availability, IBM WebSphere Developer Technical Journal, April 14, 2010 [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/1004_webcon/1004_webcon.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Dickerson: Service Recovery &amp;
Availability, IEEE Computer Society, 2010 Meeting [http://ewh.ieee.org/r1/rochester/computer/2010/20100610/PlatformAvailabilityPresentation.IEEE.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a definition of each of these terms.

'''High availability'''
refers to the ability to avoid unplanned outages by eliminating [[Single point of failure|single points of failure]].
This is a measure of the reliability of the hardware, operating system, middleware, and database manager software. 
Another measure of high availability is the ability to minimize the effect of an unplanned outage by masking the outage from the end users. 
This can be accomplished by providing redundancy or quickly restarting failed components.

Availability is usually expressed as a percentage of uptime in a given year:
{| class="wikitable"
!Availability
!Downtime per year
|-
|99.9%
|8.76 hours
|-
|99.99%
|1 hour
|-
|99.999%
|5 minutes
|}
When defining such a percentage it needs to be specified if it applies to the hardware, the [[IT infrastructure]] or the business application on top.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsmsolutions.com/newsletters/DITYvol2iss47.pdf itSM Solutions Newsletter December 2006: The Paradox of the 9s]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Continuous operation''' refers to the ability to avoid planned outages. 
For continuous operation there must be ways to perform necessary administrative work, like hardware and software maintenance while the business application remains available to the end users. This is accomplished by providing multiple servers and switching end users to an available server at times when one server is made unavailable. 
Note that a system running in continuous operation is not necessarily operating with high availability because an excessive number of unplanned outages could compromise this.

'''Continuous availability''' combines the characteristics of high availability and continuous operation to provide the ability to keep the business application running without any noticeable downtime.

==Types of outages==

'''Planned outages''' are deliberate and are scheduled at a convenient time. These involve such activities as:
- Hardware installation or maintenance
- Software maintenance or upgrades of the operating system, the middleware, the database server or the business application
- Database administration such as offline backup, or offline reorganization

'''Unplanned outages''' are unexpected outages that are caused by the failure of any system component. 
They include hardware failures, software issues, or people and process issues.

==History==
Various commercially viable examples exist for hardware/software implementations. These include:
* [[Tandem computer|Tandem NonStop Computers]]
* [[Stratus VOS|Stratus]]
* [[IBM Parallel Sysplex]]

'''DSSP''' stands for ''digital shape sampling'' and ''processing''. It is an alternative and often preferred way of describing "[[reverse engineering]]" [[software]] and hardware. The term originated in a 2005 [[Society of Manufacturing Engineers]]' "Blue Book"&lt;ref&gt;Peter Marks, Capturing a Competitive Edge Through Digital Shape Sampling &amp; Processing (DSSP), SME Blue Book Series, 2005, [http://www.irgplotters.com/media/DSSP.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; on the topic, which referenced numerous suppliers of both scanning hardware and processing software.

DSSP employs various [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] scanning methods, including laser scanners, to acquire thousands to millions of points on the surface of a form and then software from a variety of suppliers to convert the resulting "[[point cloud]]" into forms useful for inspection, computer-aided design, visualization and other applications. It may also employ volumetric methods of scanning, such as digital [[tomography]].

Some common applications include CAI (computer-aided inspection), creation of 3D [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] models from scanned data, medical applications, 3D imaging for [[Web 2.0]] applications, and the restoration of culturally significant artifacts; as well as conventional reverse engineering for creating replacement parts.

The term 'reverse engineering' itself has acquired some notoriety when the technology has been used to copy others' designs.

The term 'laser scanning' has also been used somewhat interchangeably for DSSP. However, there are two problems with the term as a broad description of the field. First, it is only one of many alternative scanning technologies. Second, it misses the essential role of processing software in converting point cloud data into useful forms.

In some ways, DSSP is a 3D analog to DSP ([[digital signal processing]]) in that the software attempts to extract a clear and accurate 3D image from point data that may include [[noise]]. The notion of 'shape sampling' embedded in the term also acknowledges that, as in many measurement processes, the accuracy of the 3D data will depend upon the number and accuracy of points sampled.

The speed and accuracy of both scanners to acquire data and software [[algorithm]]s to extract useful [[data]] has dramatically increased in recent years. The amount of data capturing capability has also increased many fold, due to the advances in the camera technology and  faster , more powerful computers. As some the limitations of the technology are eliminated and costs reduced, more uses are appearing.

'''''Edison, the Man''''' is a 1940 [[biographical film]] depicting the life of inventor [[Thomas Edison]], who was played by [[Spencer Tracy]]. [[Hugo Butler]] and [[Dore Schary]] were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Story|Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Story]] for their work on this film.  However, much of the film's script fictionalizes or exaggerates the real events of Edison's life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicfilmguide.com/index6cda.html Edison, the Man - Classic Film Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was the second of a complementary pair of Edison biopics released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1940. ''[[Young Tom Edison]]'' starring [[Mickey Rooney]] was released first and told the story of Edison's youth.&lt;ref name="tcm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/3201/Young-Tom-Edison/articles.html |title=Young Tom Edison (1940) |last= |first= |date= |website=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |publisher= |accessdate=November 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1869, anxious to be more than a tramp telegraph operator, Edison ([[Spencer Tracy]]) travels to New York at the prompting of an old friend, Bunt Cavatt ([[Lynne Overman]]). He goes to work for Mr. Els ([[Henry Travers]]).  He tries to persuade financier Mr. Taggart ([[Gene Lockhart]]) to fund the development of his inventions, but Taggart has no interest in financing “green electrical workers”. However, General Powell ([[Charles Coburn]]), the president of [[Western Union]], does.

Edison eventually sells an invention to Taggart and Powell for $40,000, enabling him to get married and open his own “invention factory” at [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]].  In the next few years, he perfects the [[phonograph]] with his devoted staff.

Trouble arises when Bunt brags to reporters that Edison has invented the electric light.  Since he hasn't yet, he is condemned by the scientific community (encouraged by Taggart, whose gas stocks are threatened by the announcement). Edison “leaves science behind”, and with a Herculean trial-and-error effort, finally succeeds in inventing a practical electric light.  His subsequent plans to light New York are again hindered by Taggart, who arranges it so that Edison is only given six months to complete the entire task. Nevertheless, Edison finishes the job just in time.

==Quotes==
“I’m an inventor. I can’t be told what to do. I’ve got to do the things I want to do. I work with ideas, visionary things. Nobody—not even I—knows how useful they’re going to be or how profitable until I had a chance to work them out in my own way.”

“You think you’re nothing but wood and metal and glass. But you’re not: you’re dreams and hard work and heart. You’d better not disappoint us.”

“It’s not the money wrapped up in the laboratory, it’s the lives wrapped up in the laboratory.  It’s come to mean everything that I ever set out to do. It means a weekly paycheck for all my men. It means home, shelter, clothing, and food for lots of families.”

“He hasn’t got a darn thing but I like to hear him talk that way.”

==Reception==
[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Tracy's performance for bringing "human and vital substantiality" to the role, but criticized the film for its historical inaccuracies: "When Metro deliberately distorts certain important details in Edison's career and boldly invents others—even though it were done with the sanction of his family—the question arises as to whether this creation is intended to be a reliable portrait of the great inventor or just another fellow who looks something like him. Frankly, we think it wiser to regard it in the second light."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE6DD1E30E53ABC4F53DFB066838B659EDE |title=Movie Review - Edison the Man |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |authorlink=Bosley Crowther |date=June 7, 1940 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=November 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film "a top-bracket picture from Metro that takes its place among the more important biographical contributions by the screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=May 22, 1940 |title=Edison, the Man |url= |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |publisher=Variety, Inc. |page=14 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' wrote: "As in ''Young Tom Edison'', this offers good entertainment for both young and old, in spite of the fact that the action is not particularly fast-moving.

[[Image:Chromatic-tuner.jpg|thumb|Pocket-sized [[Korg]] chromatic [[LCD]] tuner, with simulated analog indicator needle]]
In music, an '''electronic tuner''' is a device that detects and displays the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of musical notes played on a [[musical instrument]]. "Pitch" is the highness or lowness of a musical note, which is typically measured in [[Hertz]]. Simple tuners indicate—typically with an [[Measuring device|analog needle]]-dial, [[LED]]s, or an [[LCD screen]]—whether a pitch is lower, higher, or equal to the desired pitch. In the 2010s, [[software application]]s can turn a [[smartphone]], [[tablet (computer)|tablet]], or [[personal computer]] into a tuner. More complex and expensive tuners indicate pitch more precisely. Tuners vary in size from units that fit in a pocket to 19" [[rack-mount]] units. [[Guitar technician|Instrument technician]]s and [[Piano tuning|piano tuners]] typically use more expensive, accurate tuners.&lt;ref&gt;Piano Tuners Have Built a Bridge To 18th Century. By KATIE HAFNER. New York Times. February 17, 2000. Article describes the use of electronic tuners by piano and harpsichord tuning technicians, including Mr. Callahan's $800 USD CyberTuner software. Available at: https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E4DA1331F934A25751C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2
&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest tuners detect and display tuning only for a single pitch—often "A" or "E"—or for a small number of pitches, such as the six used in the [[standard tuning]] of a [[guitar]] (E,A,D,G,B,E). More complex tuners offer [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] tuning for all 12 pitches of the equally tempered octave. Some electronic tuners offer additional features, such as pitch calibration, [[Musical temperament|temperament]] options, the sounding of a desired pitch through an [[instrument amplifier|amplifier plus speaker]], and adjustable "read-time" settings that affect how long the tuner takes to measure the pitch of the note.

Among the most accurate tuning devices, '''strobe tuners''' work differently than regular electronic tuners. They are [[stroboscope]]s that flicker a light at the same frequency as the note. The light shines on a wheel that spins at a precise speed. The interaction of the light and regularly-spaced marks on the wheel creates a [[stroboscopic effect]] that makes the marks for a particular pitch appear to stand still when the pitch is in tune. These can tune instruments and audio devices more accurately than most non-strobe tuners. However, mechanical strobe units are expensive and delicate, and their moving parts require periodic servicing, so they are used mainly in applications that require higher precision, such as by professional instrument makers and repair experts.

==Regular types==
Regular electronic tuners contain either an input jack for electric instruments (usually a 1/4" [[patch cord]] input), a microphone, or a clip-on sensor (e.g., a [[piezoelectric]] [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]]) or some combination of these inputs.  Pitch detection circuitry drives some type of display (an analog needle, an LCD simulated image of a needle, LED lights, or a spinning translucent disk illuminated by a strobing backlight). Some tuners have an output, or through-put, so the tuner can connect 'in-line' from an electric instrument to an [[instrument amplifier]] or [[mixing console]]. Small tuners are usually [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] powered. Many battery powered tuners also have a jack for an optional [[Alternating current|AC]] power supply.
[[File:Korg Pitchblack (tuned).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Some rock and pop guitarists and bassists use "[[stompbox]]" format electronic tuners that route the electric signal for the instrument through the unit via a 1/4" patch cable. These pedal-style tuners usually have an output so that the signal can be plugged into a [[guitar amp]].]]

Most musical instruments generate a fairly complex [[waveform]]. It contains a number of harmonic partials, including the [[fundamental frequency]] (which a typical listener perceives as the pitch of the note) and additional "[[harmonic]]s" (also called "partials" or "overtones"). Each instrument produces  different ratios of harmonics, which is what makes notes of the same pitch played on different instruments (e.g., an A 440&amp;nbsp;Hz note played on oboe, violin or electric guitar) sound different. As well, this waveform  constantly changes. This means that for non-strobe tuners to be accurate, the tuner must process a number of cycles and use the pitch average to drive its display. [[Background noise]] from other musicians or [[harmonic]] overtones from the musical instrument can impede the electronic tuner from "locking" onto the input frequency. This is why the needle or display on regular electronic tuners tends to waver when a pitch is played. Small movements of the needle, or LED, usually represent a tuning error of 1 cent. Typical accuracy of these types of tuners is around +/- 3 cents. Some inexpensive LED tuners may drift by as much as +/- 9 cents.

"Clip-on" tuners typically attach to instruments with a spring-loaded clip that has a built-in contact microphone. Clipped onto a guitar [[headstock]] or violin [[Scroll (music)|scroll]], these sense pitch even in loud environments, for example when other people are tuning.

Some guitar tuners fit into the instrument itself. Typical of these are the Sabine AX3000 and the "NTune" device. The NTune consists of a switching [[potentiometer]], a wiring harness, illuminated plastic display disc, a circuit board and a battery holder. The unit installs in place of an electric guitar's existing volume knob control. The unit functions as a regular volume knob when not in tuner mode. To operate the tuner, the player pulls the volume knob up. The tuner disconnects the guitar's output so the tuning process is not amplified. The lights on the illuminated ring, under the volume knob, indicate the note being tuned. When the note is in tune a green "in tune" indicator light illuminates. After tuning is complete the musician pushes the volume knob back down, disconnecting the tuner from the circuit and re-connecting the [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]]s to the output jack.

[[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson guitars]] released a guitar model in 2008 called the ''[[Gibson Robot Guitar|Robot Guitar]]''—a customized version of either the [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]] or [[Gibson SG|SG]] model. The guitar is fitted with a special tailpiece with in-built sensors that pick up the frequency of the strings. An illuminated control knob selects different tunings. Motorized tuning machines on the [[headstock]] automatically tune the guitar. In "intonation" mode, the device displays how much adjustment the bridge requires with a system of flashing LEDs on the control knob.

The first automated guitar tuner was invented by JD Richard in 1982 while studying Electrical Engineering at the University of New Brunswick, New Brunswick Canada. This tuner was based on phase-locked-looped feedback design that listened to the frequency of the string and turned a stepper motor (with a 400/1 gear ratio) attached to the tuning peg of the guitar. This first design never went into production although the thesis paper can still be obtained at the university. (Ref: UNB, Canada, Department of Electrical Engineering, Paper "Automated Guitar Tuner by J.D. Steven Richard - April 1982"; Supervisor Dr. J.P. Burgess)

===Regular needle, LCD and LED display tuners===
A needle, LCD or regular LED type tuner uses a microprocessor to measure the average period of the waveform. It uses that information to drive the needle or array of lights. When the musician plays a single note, the tuner senses the pitch. The tuner then displays the pitch in relation to the desired pitch, and indicates whether the input pitch is lower, higher, or equal to the desired pitch. With needle displays, the note is in tune when the needle is in a 90° vertical position, with leftward or rightward deviations indicating that the note is flat or sharp, respectively. Tuners with a needle are often supplied with a [[backlight]], so that the display can be read on a darkened stage.

For block [[LED]] or [[LCD]] display tuners, markings on the readout drift left if the note is flat and right if the note is sharp from the desired pitch. If the input frequency is matched to the desired pitch frequency the LEDs are steady in the middle and an 'in tune' reading is given.

Some LCDs [[mimic]] needle tuners with a needle graphic that moves in the same way as a genuine needle tuner. Somewhat misleadingly, many LED displays have a 'strobe mode' that mimics strobe tuners by scrolling the flashing of the LEDs cyclically to simulate the display of a true strobe. However, these are all just display options. The way a regular tuner 'hears' and compares the input note to a desired pitch is exactly the same, with no change in accuracy. For more on how strobe tuners work see the dedicated section.

The least expensive models only detect and display a small number of pitches, often those pitches that are required to tune a given instrument (e.g., E, A, D, G, B, E of standard guitar tuning). While this type of tuner is useful for bands that only use stringed instruments such as guitar and electric bass, it is not that useful for tuning brass or woodwind instruments. Tuners at the next price point offer chromatic tuning, the ability to detect and assess all the pitches in the [[chromatic]] scale (e.g., C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}, etc.). Chromatic tuners can be used for B{{music|b}} and E{{music|b}} brass instruments, such as saxophones and horns. Many models have circuitry that automatically detects which pitch is being played, and then compares it against the correct pitch. Less expensive models require the musician to specify the target pitch via a switch or slider. Most low- and mid-priced electronic tuners only allow tuning to an [[equal temperament]] scale.

[[Electric guitar]] and [[electric bass]] players who perform concerts may use electronic tuners built into an [[effects pedal]], often called a ''stomp box''. These tuners have a rugged metal or heavy-duty plastic housing and a foot-operated switch to toggle between the tuner and a bypass mode. Professional guitarists may use a more expensive version of the LED tuner mounted in a rack-mount case with a larger range of LEDs for more accurate pitch display. Many models let the user select reference pitches other than [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]]. On many electronic tuners, the user can select a different note—useful for, for example, dropping a guitar's tuning to a lower pitch (e.g., [[Dropped tuning]]). Some models are adjustable standards other than A=440. This is useful to some [[Baroque music|Baroque]] musicians who play [[period instrument]]s at lower reference pitches—such as A=435. Some higher-priced electronic tuners support tuning to a range of different temperaments—a feature useful to some guitarists and harpsichord players.

Some expensive tuners also include an on-board speaker that can sound notes, either to facilitate tuning by ear or to act as a pitch reference point for intonation practice. Some expensive tuners provide an adjustable read time that controls at what time interval the circuitry assesses pitch. The combination of all the above features makes some tuners preferable for tuning instruments in an [[orchestra]]. These are sometimes called "orchestral tuners".

===Clip-on===
[[File:KORG AW-2 Clip-On Tuner.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A clip-on tuner attaches to the instrument and senses the vibrations from the instrument, even in a noisy environment.]]
A clip-on tuner clips on to an instrument—such as onto the headstock of a guitar or the bell of a trombone. A vibration sensor built into the clip transmits the instrument vibrations to the tuning circuitry. The absence of a microphone makes these tuners immune to background noise, so musicians can tune in noisy environments, including while other musicians are tuning. The clip-on tuner was invented in 1995 by Mark Wilson of OnBoard Research Corporation, which marketed it as The Intellitouch Tuner Model PT1.

===Apps===
Many chromatic and guitar tuner apps are available for Android and iOS smartphones. Many are free to download and install.

==Strobe tuners==
Strobe tuners (the popular term for stroboscopic tuners) are the most accurate type of tuner. There are three types of strobe tuners: the mechanical rotating disk strobe tuner, an LED array strobe in place of the rotating disk, and "virtual strobe" tuners with LCDs or ones that work on [[personal computer]]s. A strobe tuner shows the difference between a reference frequency and the musical note being played. Even the slightest difference between the two shows up as a rotating motion in the strobe display. The accuracy of the tuner is only limited by the internal frequency generator. The strobe tuner detects the pitch either from a TRS input jack or a built-in or external microphone connected to the tuner.

The first strobe tuner dates back to 1936 and was originally made by the [[C.G. Conn|Conn]] company; it was called the '''Stroboconn''' and was produced for approximately 40 years. However, these strobes are now mainly collector pieces. They had 12 strobe discs, driven by one motor. The gearing between discs was a very close approximation to the [[Twelfth root of two|12th root of two]] ratio. This tuner had an electrically driven temperature-compensated tuning fork; the electrical output of this fork was amplified to run the motor. The fork had sliding weights, an adjustment knob, and a dial to show the position of the weights. These weights permitted setting it to different reference frequencies (such as A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 435&amp;nbsp;Hz), although over a relatively narrow range, perhaps a whole tone.  When set at A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 440&amp;nbsp;Hz the tuning fork produced a 55&amp;nbsp;Hz signal, which drove the four-pole 1650 RPM synchronous motor to which the A disc was mounted.  (The other discs were all gear-driven off of this one.)  Incoming audio was amplified to feed a long neon tube common to all 12 discs. Wind instrument repair people liked this tuner because it needed no adjustment to show different notes.  Anyone who had to move this tuner around was less inclined to like it because of its size and weight: two record-player-sized cases of 30-40 pounds each.

[[File:Peterson400Tuner.png|thumb|140px|[[Peterson Tuners]] Model 400, 1967]]
The best known brand in strobe tuner technology is [[Peterson Tuners]] who in 1967 marketed their first strobe tuner, the ''Model 400''. Other companies, such as Sonic Research, [[TC Electronic]], and Planet Waves, sell highly accurate LED-based true strobe tuners. Other LED tuners have a 'strobe mode' that emulates the appearance of a strobe. However, the accuracy of these tuners in strobe mode, while sufficient for most tuning, is no better than in any other mode, as they use the same technique as any basic tuner to measure frequency, only displaying it in a way that imitates a strobe tuner.

===How it works===
Mechanical strobe tuners have a series of lamps or [[LED]]s powered by amplified audio from the instrument; they flash (or strobe) at the same frequency as the input signal. For instance an 'A' played on a guitar's 6th string at the 5th fret has the frequency of 110 [[Hertz|Hz]] when in tune. An 'A' played on the 1st string at the 5th fret vibrates at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. As such, the lamps would flash either 110 or 440 times per second in the above examples. In front of these flashing lights is a motor-driven, [[translucent]] printed disc with rings of alternating transparent and opaque sectors.

This disc rotates at a fixed specific speed, set by the user. Each disc rotation speed is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is at exactly the same frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the [[persistence of vision]]) from the strobing effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good [[Gramophone record|turntables]] for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The [[utility frequency|power frequency]], either 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.

[[Image:Strobe tuner disc.jpg|right|thumb|Pattern of a mechanical strobe tuner disc]]
As the disc has multiple bands, each with different spacings, each band can be read for different partials within one note. As such, extremely fine tuning can be obtained, because the user can tune to a particular partial within a given note. This is impossible on regular needle, LCD or LED tuners.  The strobe system is about 30 times more accurate than a quality electronic tuner, being  accurate to 1/10 of a cent.  Advertisements for the Sonic Research LED strobe claim that it is calibrated to ±&amp;nbsp;0.0017 cents and guaranteed to maintain an accuracy of ±&amp;nbsp;0.02 cents or 1/50 of a cent.

Strobe units can often be calibrated for many tunings and preset temperaments and allow for custom temperament programming, [[stretched tuning]], "sweetened" temperament tunings and [[Buzz Feiten]] tuning modifications.  Due to their accuracy and ability to display partials even on instruments with a very short "voice" (e.g., notes of short duration), strobe tuners can perform tuning tasks that would be very difficult, if not impossible, for needle-type tuners. For instance, needle/LED display type tuners cannot track the signal to identify a tone of the Caribbean [[steelpan]] (often nicknamed the "steeldrum") due to its very short "voice". A tuner needs to be able to detect the first few partials for tuning such an instrument, which means that only a strobe tuner can be used for steelpan tuning. This is also true of the comb teeth used in mechanical musical instruments like [[Music Box]]es and the like. In such cases a technician has to physically remove metal from the  tooth to reach the desired note. The metal teeth only resonates briefly when plucked. Great accuracy is required as once the metal is cut or filed away, the lost material cannot be replaced. As such, the strobe-type tuners are the unit of choice for such tasks. Tuners with an accuracy of better than 0.2 [[Cent (music)|cent]] are required for guitar intonation tuning.

One of the most expensive strobe tuners is the Peterson ''[[Strobe Center]]'', which has twelve separate mechanical strobe displays; one for each pitch of the equally tempered octave. This unit (about $3,500 US) can tune multiple notes of a sound or chord, displaying each note's overtone sub-structure simultaneously. This gives an overall picture of tuning within a sound, note or [[Chord (music)|chord]] that is not possible with most other tuning devices. (The TC Electronic Polytune can display the pitch accuracy of up to six pre-selected notes.) It is often used for tuning complex instruments and sound sources, or difficult-to-tune instruments where the technician requires a very accurate and complete [[aural]] picture of an instrument's output. For instance, when tuning musical [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]s, this model displays several of the bell's [[Harmonic series (music)#Harmonic vs. partial|partial]]s (hum, second partial, [[Organ stop|tierce]], quint and nominal/naming note) as well as the prime, and each of their partials, on separate displays. The unit is heavy and fragile, and requires a regular maintenance schedule. Each of the twelve displays requires periodic re-calibration. It can be used to teach students about note substructures, which show on the separate strobing displays.

====Strobe developments====
[[File:StroboStomp.png|thumb|100px|[[Peterson StroboStomp]]]]
Mechanical disc strobe tuners are expensive, bulky, delicate, and require periodic maintenance (keeping the motor that spins the disc at the correct speed, replacing the strobing LED backlight, etc.). For many, a mechanical strobe tuner is simply not practical for one or all of the above reasons. To address these issues, in 2001 [[Peterson Tuners]] added a line of non-mechanical electronic strobe tuners that have [[LCD]] [[dot-matrix]] displays mimicking a mechanical strobe disc display, giving a [[stroboscopic effect]]. In 2004 Peterson made a model of LCD strobe in a sturdy floor based "stomp box" for live on-stage use. Virtual strobe tuners are as accurate as standard mechanical disc strobe tuners. However, there are limitations to the virtual system compared to the disc strobes. Virtual strobes display fewer bands to read note information, and do not pick up harmonic partials like a disc strobe. Rather, each band on a virtual strobe represents octaves of the fundamental. A disc strobe provides "one band correspondence"—each band displays a particular frequency of the note being played. On the virtual strobe system, each band combines a few close frequencies for easier reading on the LCD. This is still extremely accurate for intoning and tuning most instruments—but, as of this writing, no virtual strobe tuner provides detailed information on partials.

Sonic Research and Planet Waves both released a true-strobe with a bank of LEDs arranged in a circle that gives a strobing effect based upon the frequency of the input note. Both LCD and LED display true strobes do not require mechanical servicing and are much cheaper than the mechanical types. As such, they are a popular option for musicians who want the accuracy of a strobe without the high cost and the maintenance requirements. However, LED strobe displays offer no information about the harmonic structure of a note, unlike LCD types, which do offer four bands of consolidated information.

[[Image:StroboSoft screen.png|left|thumb|200px|The tuning screen from [[Peterson Tuners|Peterson's]] [[StroboSoft]] v1.]]
Peterson released a PC-based virtual strobe tuner in 2008 called "StroboSoft". This computer [[software]] package has all the features of a virtual strobe, such as user-programmable temperaments and tunings. To use this tuner, a musician must have a computer next to the instrument to be tuned. An alternative is the PC-based strobe tuner TB Strobe Tuner with fewer functions.

[[File:VirtualStrobe.png|thumb|160px|Peterson VirtualStrobe application on [[iPod Touch]]]]
In 2009 [[Peterson Tuners]] released a VirtualStrobe tuner as an end-user application add-on for Apple's [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] where the application is bought cheaply as a download and installed. There exists a special 1/4" TRS jack adapter for connecting an electric instrument to the iPhone, a notable achievement in strobe tuner technology, which has made such tuning widely available. In order to use it, however, a compatible iPod or iPhone must already be on hand.

As both mechanical and electronic strobes are still more expensive and arguably more difficult to use in order to achieve the desired results than ordinary tuners, their use is usually limited to those whose business it is accurately to intone and tune [[piano]]s, [[harp]]s, and early instruments (e. g. [[harpsichord]]s) on a regular basis: [[luthier]]s, instrument restorers and technicians – and instrument enthusiasts. These tuners make the [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] process more precise.

==Uses==

===Classical music===
[[File:ErardHarpTuning.jpg|thumb|Tuning of [[Sébastien Érard]] harp using [[Korg]] OT-120 Wide 8 Octave Orchestral Digital Tuner]]
In classical music, there is a longstanding tradition to tune "by ear", by adjusting the pitch of instruments to a reference pitch. In an orchestra, the [[oboe]] player gives a 440&amp;nbsp;Hz "A", and the different instrument sections tune to this note. In chamber music, either one of the woodwind players gives an "A", or if none is present, one of the string players, usually the first violinist, bows his or her open "A" string. If an orchestra is accompanying a piano concerto, the first oboist takes the "A" from the piano and then plays this pitch for the rest of the orchestra.

Despite this tradition of tuning by ear, electronic tuners are still widely used in classical music. In orchestras the oboist often uses a high-end electronic tuner to ensure that her/his "A" is correct. As well, other brass or woodwind players may use electronic tuners to ensure that their instruments are correctly tuned. Classical performers also use tuners off-stage for practice purposes or to check their tuning (or, with the further aid of a speaker, to practice ear training). Electronic tuners are also used in [[Opera#Role of orchestra|opera orchestra]]s for [[offstage trumpet]] effects. In offstage trumpet effects, trumpet players performs a melody from the backstage or from a hallway behind the stage, creating a haunting, muted effect. Since trumpet players cannot hear the orchestra, they cannot know whether or not their notes are in tune with the rest of the ensemble; to resolve this problem, some trumpet players use a high-end, sensitive tuner so that they can monitor the pitch of their notes.

Piano tuners, harp makers and the builders and restorers of early instruments, e.g. [[harpsichord]]s, use high-end tuners to assist with their tuning and instrument building. Even piano tuners who work mostly "by ear" may use an electronic tuner to tune just a first key on the piano, e. g. the a' to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, after which they proceed by means of octaves, approximate fifths and approximate fourths to tune the others. (In the [[twelve-tone equal temperament]] system dominant in classical and Western music, all intervals except the octave are slightly "mistuned" or compromised compared to more consonant [[just interval]]s.) They may also use electronic tuners to get a very out-of-tune piano roughly in pitch, after which point they tune by ear. Electronic tuning devices for keyboard instruments are for various reasons generally much more complex and therefore expensive than in the case of other widely used instruments.

===Popular and folk music===
In popular music, amateur and professional bands from styles as varied as [[country music|country]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] use electronic tuners to ensure that the guitars and electric bass are correctly tuned. In popular music genres such as [[rock music]], there is a great deal of stage volume due to the use of [[drums]] and [[guitar amplifier]]s, so it can be difficult to tune "by ear". Electronic tuners are helpful aids at [[jam session]]s where a number of players are sharing the stage, because it helps all of the players to have their instruments tuned to the same pitch, even if they have come to the session halfway through. Tuners are helpful with acoustic instruments, because they are more affected by temperature and humidity changes. An acoustic guitar or upright bass that is perfectly in tune backstage can change in pitch under the heat of the stage lights and from the humidity from thousands of audience members.

Tuners are used by [[guitar technician]]s who are hired by rock and pop bands to ensure that all of the band's instruments are ready to play at all times. Guitar technicians (often called guitar techs) tune all of the instruments (electric guitars, electric basses, acoustic guitars, mandolins, etc.) before the show, after they are played, and before they are used onstage. Guitar techs also retune instruments throughout the show. Whereas amateur musicians typically use a relatively inexpensive quartz tuner, guitar technicians typically use expensive, high-end tuners such as strobe tuners. Most strobe tuners, counter-intuitively, also use quartz crystal oscillators as time references, although the responses are processed differently by the different units.

===Bell tuning===
Strobe tuners are used in the tuning of bells, which require accurate tuning of many partials. The removal of metal from various parts of the bell shape is by a tuning lathe, and once too much metal has been removed it cannot be reversed. Hence accurate approach to the desired tuning partial is essential to prevent overshoot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13007">'''FIX Algorithmic Trading Definition Language''', better known as '''FIXatdl''', is a standard for the exchange of meta-information required to enable algorithmic trading activity within the financial markets.  It works in tandem with the [[Fix protocol|Financial Information eXchange]] (FIX) protocol which is the [[lingua franca]] of [[electronic trading]] in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] market.

== Background ==

Prior to the mid-nineties, virtually all trading of securities was transacted over the phone, but with the advent of FIX, trading moved steadily over to electronic means.  The FIX protocol is used to communicate between [[Sell side|sell-side]] and the [[Buy side|buy-side]] [[Order Management System#Financial securities|Order Management Systems]] (OMS) to exchange orders and order execution information without human intervention, using standardised messages and workflows that are defined by the protocol.
Initially, sell-side firms only provided access to their 'trading desks' via FIX, which meant that once an order arrived at the sell-side broker, it was handled by a human trader, at least at the start of its lifecycle.  Subsequently, sell-side firms started to offer direct access via FIX to the exchanges/markets they were members of; this is known as [[direct market access]] (DMA).  At this time, many sell-side firms had their own proprietary systems to trade automatically in the market, using [[algorithmic trading]] strategies, and over time they began to see that offering access to these trading strategies to the buy-side was a way to attract business and increase revenue.

Whilst FIX is an extensible protocol, there were two challenges that arose as a result of sell-side firms offering access to their algorithmic trading strategies via FIX.  The first was that each sell-side strategy had its own parameters that had to be included as part of the order, so every firm ended up requiring a different set of fields (known in FIX as "tags") to be included in the FIX message.  This made life very difficult for the buy-side, and more particularly for their suppliers as adding new algorithms to their trading systems and managing all the different combinations of tags became a significant overhead for their development operations.

The second issue for the market was that each sell-side firm had a specific way they wanted their algorithms to be displayed on the buy-side OMS, with controls in the user interface arranged logically for easy order entry.  Again this proved a challenge for the buy-side systems vendors, as each new screen for each sell-side broker required dedicated development and testing effort.

== History ==

To tackle these issues, FIX Protocol Limited established the Algorithmic Trading Working Group in Q3 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Algorithmic Trading &amp; FIX:
Extending the Reach of FIX, FPL, November 2004: http://www.jandj.com/presentations/wednesday/AlgoTradingFIX.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial focus of the group was to solve the first of these issues, which it did by defining a new group of fields, the StrategyParametersGrp, made up of FIX tags 957 through 960 – these tags were formally introduced with the release of FIX 5.0 in Q4 2006.  By allowing sell-side firms to include their proprietary fields in a repeating name-value pair structure, there was no requirement for OMS vendors to define specific FIX message structures for each sell-side trading destination.

This solution was not broadly adopted, in part because of the limited penetration of FIX 5.0 and in part due to the fact that firms already had working implementations in the market place that they were unwilling to change without good cause.  Perhaps more importantly, it failed to solve what was the more substantial issue for the market, the complexity for the buy-side vendors resulting from lack of standardisation.

The idea of using an XML structure to describe the presentation of algorithm user interfaces and their accompanying parameters was firstly suggested within the working group by Daniel Clayden, then of [[Jpmorgan chase|JP Morgan Chase]] in a 2005 forum posting.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Clayden’s original post on the concept of what became FIXatdl: http://www.fixprotocol.org/discuss/read/d3b2124e&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the working group developed this idea during 2006 and in January 2007 invited broader industry participation at a workshop to review their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;FPL Call for Participation, January 2007: http://www.fixprotocol.org/documents/1994/Algo%20workshop%20details_20070108.doc&lt;/ref&gt; A specification was eventually produced and this began beta testing in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;FPL Announces FIX Algorithmic Trading Definition Language Enters Beta Phase, Automated Trading, July 2007: http://www.automatedtrader.net/news/algorithmic-trading-news/756/fpl-announces-fix-algorithmic-trading-definition-language-enters-beta-phase&lt;/ref&gt;  This specification became FIXatdl 1.0 which was approved by the FPL Global Technical Committee (GTC) on March 28, 2008.

Despite some initial enthusiasm, overall Version 1.0 had a lacklustre reception by the marketplace.  Some vendors saw an opportunity to provide services around the standard, such as ULLINK with their algorithm publication and management and tool UL AMS but whilst the major OMS vendors were irritated by the overhead of implementing new broker algorithms, they had grown to enjoy the revenue that they could command from both their customers and from brokers keen to get their algorithms onto buy-side desks.

Although Version 1.0 was a major step forward, it had some significant limitations.  In particular, the definition of the data to be transmitted and its presentation on the user interface were tightly bound together, limiting the flexibility sell-side brokers had in defining their algorithms.  The 1.0 specification also afforded insufficient control in terms of user interface layouts.
The working group set out to address these limitations in what was to become Version 1.1 on the specification.  The first major change was to split the definition of the data content from the presentation, defining what is referred to as a separate "Data Contract" made up of the algorithm parameters, their data types and supporting information such as minimum and maximum values.  A separate section of the XML document is then concerned with the layout of the user interface, what controls to use for each parameter and where to place them on the screen.  An [[XML Schema (W3C)|XSD schema]] is provided to ensure that FIXatdl files are valid and well-formed.

FIXatdl Version 1.1 was preliminarily approved by the GTC on February 9, 2010, when it entered a public comment period, and then finally approved on March 3, 2010.  The specification was formally introduced to the market at the FPL’s Europe Middle East and Africa conference on March 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;FIXatdl on the FIX EMEA 2010 Protocol Conference agenda:  http://fixprotocol.org/fplevents/emea_2010/program.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Document structure ==

A FIXatdl document can contain one or more strategy definitions.  Within a strategy definition, there are four main sections as follows:
*Meta-data section defining which geographical regions, markets (exchanges) and asset classes the strategy is applicable to
*Parameters section, listing out each of the parameters used by the strategy, their data types, constraints (e.g., minimum and maximum values) and how they should be represented in the resulting FIX message
*StrategyLayout section which defines the user interface controls to be used for this strategy, how they should be laid out on the screen and how they map to the parameters described in the previous section of the document
*StrategyEdit section which describes the validation rules to be applied – typically these will be cross field validations
FIXatdl documents should validate against the set of XSD schema provided by FPL.  These schema are organised into the following four categories:
*Core (defines data content, data types, constraints, etc.)
*Layout (defines the controls that can be used and how they are laid out)
*Validation (self-explanatory)
*Flow (allows controls to be enabled/disabled, hidden/shown and updated, depending on the state or content of other controls)

== User interface capabilities==
[[File:FIXatdl-StrategyPanels.png|thumb|200px|Strategy panels]]
Version 1.1 supports 14 different user interface controls, which can be grouped as follows:
*Labels
*Text entry fields (often referred to as text boxes)
*Checkboxes and radio buttons, both singly and in lists
*Listboxes, both single and multi-selection
*Dropdown lists, both editable and non-editable
*Clock controls, for date/time entry
*Sliders, for selecting one of a small number of settings
*Numeric spinners, both single and double for integers and floating point numbers respectively
Controls are laid out using a hierarchy of panels (referred to as StrategyPanels), each of which can be horizontal or vertical in orientation. The picture on the right shows how the XML elements refer to the individual panels within a given layout.

== Adoption ==

Unlike the previous version, Version 1.1 looks set to be widely accepted and adopted by the securities industry.  Even at the end of 2009, there were already firms using the 1.1 standard, despite its pre-release status.  Examples of firms supporting the FIXatdl standard include:
* RealTick Execution Management System, by Eze Software Group &lt;ref&gt;RealTick adds latest Deutsche Bank Algorithms: http://www.automatedtrader.net/news/ems-news/26664/realtick-adds-latest-deutsche-bank-algorithms&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also open source [[Java (software platform)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]] implementations, [https://github.com/atdl4j/atdl4j atdl4j] and Atdl4net respectively, which are both Version 1.1 compliant.

== Other user interface standards ==

The question has often been asked, why doesn’t FIXatdl use an off-the-shelf user interface standard, such as Mozilla’s [[XUL]],  Microsoft’s [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] or [[Apache Flex]]?  This is a valid question, but it seems that the authors of the specification wanted to maintain complete [[platform independence]] and adopting any one platform would risk damaging this proposition.  Whilst lacking the degree of sophistication of some of these platforms, the current specification provides an acceptable degree of control in terms of user interface layout without being unduly restrictive.  It remains to be seen how this design choice will pan out, and it does seem likely that further refinement of this part of the specification will be needed as adoption grows.

'''FOX-7''' or '''1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene''' '''(DADNE)'''&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 6340780 - Method of preparing salts of dinitromethane&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Insensitive munition#Insensitive high explosives|insensitive high explosive]] compound.  It was first synthesized in 1998 by the [[Swedish National Defence Research Institute]] (FOA).&lt;ref name="dsto"&gt;Bemm, U.; Östmark, H. (1998) "1,1-Diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene: a Novel Energetic Material with Infinite Layers in Two Dimensions." ''Acta Cryst'' '''C54''': 1997-1999. [[doi:10.1107/S0108270198007987]]&lt;/ref&gt;

FOX-7 is similar to the insensitive chemical compound [[TATB]], which is a [[benzene]] ring compound with three [[amino]] and three [[nitro group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.tet.2005.05.010|title=The reactivity of 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7)|year=2005|last1=Hervé|first1=Grégoire|last2=Jacob|first2=Guy|last3=Latypov|first3=Nikolaj|journal=Tetrahedron|volume=61|issue=28|pages=6743}}&lt;/ref&gt; FOX-7 has a two-carbon backbone rather than a [[benzene]] ring, but the [[amino]] and [[nitro compound|nitro]] groups have similar effects in both cases according to published reports on sensitivity and chemical decay processes of FOX-7. FOX-7 is today produced by Eureco [[Bofors]] AB in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.03.034|title=Synthesis, characterization and thermolysis of 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7) and its salts|year=2006|last1=Anniyappan|first1=M.|last2=Talawar|first2=M.B.|last3=Gore|first3=G.M.|last4=Venugopalan|first4=S.|last5=Gandhe|first5=B.R.|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=137|issue=2|pages=812–9|pmid=16701943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its explosive properties appear extremely favorable; in addition to its insensitive properties, the detonation velocity of mixtures of 80% FOX-7 plus [[binder (material)|binders]] is as high as [[Composition B]], and nearly pure FOX-7 based [[plastic bonded explosive]]s are slightly superior to [[RDX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latypov|first=Nikolai V.|last2=Bergman|first2=Jan|last3=Langlet|first3=Abraham|last4=Wellmar|first4=Ulf|last5=Bemm|first5=Ulf|year=1998|title=Synthesis and reactions of 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene|journal=Tetrahedron|volume=54|issue=38|pages=11525–11536|doi=10.1016/s0040-4020(98)00673-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; FOX-7 has been calculated to have a [[detonation velocity]] of 8,870&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intdetsymp.org/detsymp2002/PaperSubmit/FinalManuscript/pdf/Karlsson-165.pdf Detonation and Sensitivity Properties of FOX-7 and Formulations Containing FOX-7], Karlsson et al., 2002, accessed Aug 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its small-scale production, the cost of FOX-7 is relatively high.  However, the production is based on commercial starting material and the synthesis is uncomplicated.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 6312538 - Chemical compound suitable for use as an explosive, intermediate and method for preparing the compound&lt;/ref&gt; The price is therefore predicted to fall as production scale increases.  There is no current full scale use of FOX-7, but it is being tested at several military research centers.  The need for less sensitive munitions is the most important driver for testing FOX-7.

;[[Acidity (wine)|Acidity]]
: The quality of wine that gives it its crispiness and vitality. A proper balance of acidity must be struck with the other elements of a wine, or else the wine may be said to be too sharp – having disproportionately high levels of acidity – or too flat – having disproportionately low levels of acidity. The three main acids found in wine are [[tartaric acid]], [[malic acid]] and [[lactic acid]]. The first two come from the grapes and the third from [[#Malolactic fermentation|Malolactic fermentation]] which often occurs in the winemaking process.
;[[Active acidity]]
:The concentration of acids in the wine with [[positively charged]] [[hydrogen]] [[ions]]. Used to gauge the "[[total acidity]]" in the wine. Measured using the [[pH]] scale.

:The amount of ethanol present in wine, usually measured as a percent of total volume ([[alcohol by volume|ABV]]) taken at 20°C
;[[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|Aerobic]] conditions
:Winemaking conditions that promote exposure to oxygen, such wine barrels kept partially full in order to oxidatively age the wine

==C==
;Cap: The layer of grape skins that are forced by rising [[carbon dioxide]] gas to the top of the fermentation vessel during [[cuvaison]].

;Carbonic acid: Carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the water content of wine. It is a [[volatile acid]] that held in [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] with the dissolved carbon dioxide gas and can not be isolated in a pure form.

;Carbonic gas: A natural by product of the fermentation process in which yeast cells convert [[sugar (wine)|sugar]] into nearly equal parts alcohol and carbonic gas. While a small amount stays presence in the wine as carbonic acid, most of the gas will rise to the surface of the fermentation vessel and attempt to escape into the air. If the fermentation vessel is closed (such as a sealed [[wine bottle]] used to make [[sparkling wine]]), the gas will dissolve into the wine and when released will make the wine sparkling.

;Carbonic maceration: A winemaking practice of fermenting whole grapes that have not been crushed. This intracellular fermentation (as opposed to the traditional extracellular fermentation of wine yeast) tends to produce fruity, deeply colored red wines with low tannins

;Casein: A [[fining (wine)|fining]] agent derived from a [[milk]] [[protein]].

;Cask: A wood barrel or storage vessel, often made from [[oak (wine)|oak]], that is used in winemaking for fermentation and/or aging

;Chauffe-vin: An optional attachment to the Cognac still that heats the wine prior to the first distillation

;[[Cellaring]]:To age wine for the purpose of improvement or [[storage (wine)|storage]].

;Centrifugal force filtration: The process of separating unwanted particles (such as dead yeast cells or fining agents) from the wine by use of centrifugal force.

;Ceramic filtration : A filtration process of the wine that utilizes [[perlite]] and is able to fine the wine to an ultrafine degree.

;[[Chaptalization]] : A [[winemaking]] process where sugar is added to the [[must]] to increase the alcohol content in the fermented wine. This is often done when grapes have not ripened adequately.

;Charmat process : The Charmat or '''bulk process''' is a method where [[sparkling wine]]s receive their [[secondary fermentation (wine)|secondary fermentation]] in large tanks, rather than individual bottles as seen in [[Méthode champenoise]].

;Clarification: A [[winemaking]] process involving the ''fining'' and ''[[filtration]]'' of wine to remove suspended solids and reduce [[turbidity]].

;Col de cygnet :The swan's neck shaped portion of a [[pot still]] used in Cognac production that transports the vapors from the pot to the [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]

;[[Cold stabilization]]: A [[winemaking]] process where wine is chilled to near freezing temperatures for several weeks to encourage the [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of [[tartrate]] crystals.

Congeners that are produced throughout the winemaking process from fermentation through maturation and even distillation for spirits such as a Cognac. These compounds include [[aldehyde]]s, [[ester]]s and [[ketone]]s which can influence the [[aroma (wine)|aroma]] and flavor of wine.

;Cork: A [[wine bottle]] [[stopper (plug)|stopper]] made from the thick outer bark of the [[cork oak]] tree.

;Cork taint: A type of [[wine fault]] describing undesirable aromas and flavors in wine often attributed to [[mold]] growth on [[chlorine]] [[bleach]]ed [[Cork (material)|cork]]s.

;Coupage: A custom of "enormous antiquity" of mixing a little good wine with much bad wine and calling it good. "The result of this operation is that the best qualities of the good are destroyed without a trace." &lt;ref&gt;Wines for Everyone, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

;Courbe de fermentation : French term for plotting the temperature and must density/sugar levels of an individual vat or tank of fermenting must to track its progress from the initiation of fermentation to dryness.
Crossflow filtration: A highspeed form of [[microfiltration]] that has the wine flow across a membrane filter rather than through it.

;Crown-cap: A [[beer bottle]] cap used as a temporary closure for a sparkling wine as it undergoes a [[secondary fermentation (wine)|secondary fermentation]].

;Crush: After [[harvest (wine)|harvest]], and prior to pressing, grape are "crushed" or broken up so that the juice is released and allowed to [[Maceration (wine)|macerate]] with the skins prior to and during fermentation. In [[viticultural terms]], "Crush" is used as a synonym for harvest time.

;Cryoextraction: A mechanical means of concentrating the grape must (and such increasing sugar concentration) by chilling the must until its water content freezes into ice crystals that are then removed. This production method is used to make so called "ice box wines" in a style similar to [[ice wine]]s which are produced by the grapes naturally freezing on the vine before harvest

;Cut: A blending term used to refer to either blending a wine with one distinct characteristic (such as high acidity) into a wine that currently dominated by the opposite characteristic (such as low acidity). It can also mean blending a red wine with a white wine in order to make a rosé. Cutting may also refer to the illegal practice of diluting a wine with water. The French term ''tailles'' or "cut" refers to the point during pressing when the quality of the grape juices degrades. The first ''tailles'' is the [[free-run]] juice followed by successive pressing.

;Cuve: A large vat used for fermentation.

Cuve Close Alternative name for the Charmat method of [[sparkling wine production]].

;Cuvée: A wine blended from several vats or batches, or from a selected vat. Also used in Champagne to denote the juice from the first pressing of a batch of grapes.

;[[Dégorgement]]
: The disgorging or removal of sediment from bottles that results from secondary fermentation.
;Délestage
: French term for [[racking]] with the purpose of removing harsh tannins from the wine in the form of grape seeds. In this process the wine is drained into a secondary vessel, allowing the [[cap (wine)|cap]] to settle to a bottom and loosen the seeds that are trapped in the pulps. As the wine drains, a filter captures the seeds and removes them from the wine. The wine is then returned the first vessel.

: [[grape juice|Juice]] obtained from [[grapes]] that have not been [[wine-press|pressed]].
;[[Fruit wine]]
: A fermented alcoholic beverage made from non-grape fruit juice which may or may not include the addition of sugar or honey. Fruit wines are always called "something" wines (e.g., plum wine), since the word wine alone is often legally defined as a beverage made only from grapes.
;Fuder
: A German oak barrel with the capacity to hold 265 gallons (1000 liters)
;Fully fermented
: A wine that was allowed to complete the process of fermentation without interruption to produce a wine that is completely [[dry (wine)|dry]].
;[[Fusel alcohol]]
:Also known as '''Fusel oils'''. By-products of fermentation and distillation that are encountered in small quantities in winemaking that can contribute to a wine's complexity. Yeast naturally produce [[propyl alcohol]], [[isobutyl alcohol]], [[isoamyl]] and [[amyl alcohol]] as fusel oils with the distillation process able to produce even larger long-chain [[hydrocarbon]]s that can be potentially unpleasant tasting and toxic. These are usually found in the "tails" fraction of a distillate which is often discarded.

;[[Grape juice]]
: The free-run or pressed juice from [[grape]]s. Unfermented grape juice is known as "[[must]]."
;[[Gyropalette]]
:A mechanized riddling palate that can complete the [[remuage]] process that would manually take several weeks over the course a few days

==H==
;Heads
:In Cognac production, this is the first fraction of alcohol spirit that is collected during the distillation process which includes volatile alcohol compounds, ethanol and potentially toxic alcohols such as methanol. This fraction is discarded.
;Hearts
:The second fraction that is collected during the distillation process in Cognac production that makes up the vast majority of the end product
;Halbfüder

;Late disgorgement
: A term, often abbreviated as LD on sparkling wine labels, that means the wine was recently [[disgorged]] after spending an extended period [[aging on its lees]].
;Leaching
: A process of [[oak barrel]] production during which some tannins are deliberately removed from the wood by [[steaming]]. The [[viticultural term]] refers to the loss of certain qualities of the soil, such as [[pH]], when rainwater removes or "leaches out" [[carbonates]] from the soil.
;[[Lees (fermentation)|Lees]]
: Wine sediment that occurs during and after fermentation, and consists of dead yeast, grape seeds, and other solids. Wine is separated from the lees by racking.
;Lees stirring
:Also known as '''bâttonage''', A process associated with ''[[sur lie]]'' aging where the lees are stirred up to extract flavor and other sensory components into the wine and to avoid reductive conditions that may contribute to various wine faults

;[[Maillard reactions]]
: The complex chemical reaction between [[amino acid]]s and [[sugar in the wine]] or grapes. During the [[raisin]]ing process of grapes, such as in the production of [[straw wine]], the Maillard reaction process play a vital role in concentrating the flavors of the grapes. During [[sparkling wine production]], the amino acids created during the [[autolysis (wine)|autolysis]] process reacts with the [[residual sugar]] of the wine to create a series of aromas and flavors associated with premium quality [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]].
;[[Malic acid]]

==History==
In 1929, financier [[George Walbridge Perkins, Jr.]] and his family purchased land located in the [[Hudson Highlands]] now called Glynwood Farm.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Glynwood|title=History and Beginnings|url=http://www.glynwood.org/about/history-and-beginnings/|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Perkins was a noted conservationist and his father [[George Walbridge Perkins]] was one of the creators of the [[Palisades Interstate Park Commission]], which to date has conserved over 100,000 acres of parklands and historic sites.&lt;ref name="Open Space"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glynwood Center|url=http://www.osiny.org/site/PageServer?pagename=HRV_Glynwood_Center&amp;printer_friendly=1|publisher=Open Space Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=History /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palisades Interstate Park Commission|url=http://www.njpalisades.org|publisher=Palisades Interstate Park Commission|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the farm uses a combination of Mr. and Mrs. Perkins' first names, George and Lynn.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;  Mr. Perkins' father's involvement in the Palisades Interstate Park Commission inspired the deep thought and conservation ethic that made Glynwood Farm more than just a farm.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;

After the death of the owners, their family preserved Glynwood Farm, making it the site of a "not-for-profit organization dedicated to rural conservation".&lt;ref name=History /&gt;  In 1995, the [[Open Space Institute]] purchased Glynwood Farm, a 957-acre estate, in an effort to preserve one of the last untouched woodlands in the lower Hudson River Valley.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Revkin|first=Andrew C.|title=Purchase for Preservation Fills a Gap in Putnam County|journal=The New York Times|date=16 October 1995|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/26/nyregion/purchase-for-preservation-fills-a-gap-in-putnam-county.html|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this $6.25 million purchase, more than 700 acres of the purchase were added to the adjacent [[Clarence Fahnestock State Park]], completing the effort by the Open Space Institute to "expand the protected lands in the Hudson Highlands" a mountain range bisected by the Hudson River.&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt;  The purchase was made with a grant provided by the [[Lila Bell Wallace|Lila Acheson]] and [[DeWitt Wallace]] Fund for the Hudson Highlands through a trust set up in 1983 to preserve unspoiled parts of the Hudson Valley by the founders of [[Reader's Digest]].&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt;  The 230-acre core of the estate, of cow pastures, farms and houses, remained a farm and became Glynwood Center.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt;

In 1997, the Glynwood Center adopted the Countryside Exchange Program, a program introduced by the Countryside Institute.&lt;ref name=History /&gt; This program brought together international teams of volunteer professionals to work with communities on their most important issues, typically those that center on conservation and economic development.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{cite journal|author=Glynwood Center|title=The Countryside Exchange|journal=The 2003 Countryside Exchange: A Program of Glynwood Center|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities would apply to participate in the Countryside Exchange and were chosen based on their depth of interest within the community, existing leadership and leadership skills, and the diversity of community members supporting the application.&lt;ref name=CE /&gt; Once selected, the community would form a Local Organizing Committee (LOC) which would the implement the Exchange Team's suggestions based on their weekly report which consisted of its observations and ideas.&lt;ref name=CE /&gt; The Countryside Exchanges, although not used anymore, still continues to provide the intellectual underpinnings for Glynwood's mission and programs.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;

==Facility==
Glynwood serves as place where community leaders can seek information, support, and training on sustainable farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organization: Glynwood Center|url=http://www.wiser.org/organization/view/4b1be04c6703c7b876c359734d18e13d|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glynwood consists of different programs to promote their mission to "save farming by strengthening farm communities and regional food systems",&lt;ref name=Glynwood-Official-Cite /&gt; the farm and a think tank that seeks innovative ways to sustainable farming.

A '''grain hopper trailer''' is a trailer pulled by a [[Tractor unit|semi tractor]] and used to haul bulk commodity products (such as [[Cereal|grain]]). These trailers are used extensively throughout the United States to transport [[agricultural]] products as well as any other commodity that can be hauled in bulk and loaded and unloaded through the trailer.

==Design==
Grain hopper trailers typically feature a rolling [[Tarpaulin|tarp]] on the top of the trailer, to enable easy loading of the product to be transported, and also offer protection during transport. They utilize two hoppers on the base of the trailer to unload to product, one servicing the rear half of the trailer, the other the front half. The output of these hoppers is usually controlled by a sliding plate on the base of the hopper, controlled by a user-operated [[Crank (mechanism)|crank handle]].

==Usage==
A grain hopper trailer is used in conjunction with various other pieces of [[List of agricultural machinery#Harvesting .2F post-harvest|agricultural machinery]] to complete the [[harvest]] of a field. [[Combine harvester]]s or similar unload the harvest into [[grain carts]], which in turn unload ''their'' load into a grain hopper trailer, for long distance transportation. The trailers are then unloaded into low-profile [[Screw conveyor#In agriculture|grain augers]] for transportation to, and long-term storage in, [[Silo|grain bins]], also known as silo's.

The '''history of videotelephony''' covers the historical development of several technologies which enable the use of [[video|live video]] in addition to [[telecommunication|voice telecommunications]]. The concept of videotelephony was first popularized in the late 1870s in both the United States and Europe, although the basic sciences to permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be discovered. This was first embodied in the device which came to be known as the video telephone, or videophone, and it evolved from intensive research and experimentation in several telecommunication fields, notably [[electrical telegraphy]], [[telephony]], [[radio]], and [[television]].

The development of the crucial video technology first started in the latter half of the 1920s in the United Kingdom and the United States, spurred notably by [[John Logie Baird]] and [[Bell Labs|AT&amp;T's Bell Labs]]. This occurred in part, at least with AT&amp;T, to serve as an adjunct supplementing the use of the telephone. A number of organizations believed that videotelephony would be superior to plain voice communications. However video technology was to be deployed in [[Analog television|analog]] [[television broadcasting]] long before it could become practical—or popular—for videophones.

Videotelephony developed in parallel with conventional [[Public switched telephone network|voice telephone systems]] from the mid-to-late 20th century. Very expensive [[videoconferencing]] systems rapidly evolved throughout the 1980s and 1990s from proprietary equipment, software and network requirements to standards-based technologies that were readily available to the general public at a reasonable cost. Only in the late 20th century with the advent of powerful [[video codec]]s combined with high-speed [[Internet access|Internet broadband]] and [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] service did videotelephony become a practical technology for regular use.

With the rapid improvements and popularity of the Internet, videotelephony has become widespread through the deployment of video-enabled [[mobile phone]]s, plus videoconferencing and [[webcam|computer webcam]]s which utilize [[Voice over IP|Internet telephony]]. In the upper echelons of government, business and commerce, [[telepresence|telepresence technology]], an advanced form of videoconferencing, has helped reduce the need to travel.

== Early history ==

[[File:telephonoscope.jpg|thumb|327px|left|"Fiction becomes fact": Imaginary "[[Thomas Edison|Edison]]" combination videophone-television, conceptualized by [[George du Maurier]] and published in [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']]. The drawing also depicts then-contemporary [[speaking tube]]s, used by the parents in the foreground and their daughter on the viewing display (1878).]]
Barely two years after the telephone was first patented in the United States in 1876 by Dr.{{Citation needed|reason=Doctorate?|date=April 2017}} [[Alexander Graham Bell]], an early concept of a combined videophone and wide-screen television called a ''[[telephonoscope]]'' was conceptualized in the popular periodicals of the day. It was also mentioned in various early science fiction works such as ''[[Le Vingtième siècle. La vie électrique]]'' (The 20th century. The electrical life) and other works written by [[Albert Robida]], and was also sketched in various cartoons by [[George du Maurier]] as a fictional invention of [[Thomas Edison]]. One such sketch was published on December 9, 1878 in [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'' magazine]].&lt;ref name="Chronomedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Punch-duMaurier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns.TVInternationalHistory-1998" /&gt;

The term '[[telectroscope]]' was also used in 1878 by French writer and publisher [[Louis Figuier]], to popularize an invention wrongly interpreted as real and incorrectly ascribed to Dr. Bell, possibly after his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Sound recording and phonograph development|Volta Laboratory]] discreetly deposited a sealed container of a [[Graphophone|Graphophone phonograph]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for safekeeping.&lt;ref name="Telegraphic Journal and Electrical Review-1880.05.01"&gt;[http://histv2.free.fr/19/seeing.htm Seeing By Electricity], ''The Telegraphic Journal and Electrical Review'', May 1, 1880, Vol. VIII, No. 174, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Figuier-1878" /&gt; Written under the pseudonym "Electrician", one article earlier claimed that "an eminent scientist" had invented a device whereby objects or people anywhere in the world "....could be seen anywhere by anybody". The device, among other functions, would allow merchants to transmit pictures of their wares to their customers, and the contents of museum collections to be made available to scholars in distant cities...."&lt;ref name="NewYorkSun-1877.05.29" /&gt;{{refn|Although the pseudonymous letter was accompanied by a technical description of how the telectroscope would work and was published in a reputable New York newspaper, researchers later noted that it was published close to [[April Fools' Day]] and believed the article was submitted as an elaborate hoax.&lt;ref name="NewYorkSun-1877.05.29" /&gt;|group="Note"}} In the era prior to the advent of [[broadcasting]], electrical "seeing" devices were conceived as adjuncts to the telephone, thus creating the concept of a videophone.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns2" /&gt;

Fraudulent reports of 'amazing' advances in video telephones would be publicized as early as 1880 and would reoccur every few years, such as the episode of 'Dr. Sylvestre' of Paris who claimed in 1902 to have invented a powerful (and inexpensive) video telephone, termed a 'spectograph', the intellectual property rights he believed were worth $5,000,000. After reviewing his claim Dr. Bell denounced the supposed invention as a "[[fairy tale]]", and publicly commented on the charlatans promoting bogus inventions for financial gain or self-promotion.&lt;ref name="PittsburghPress-1902.01.04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Electrician&amp;Mechanic-1906.08" /&gt;

However Dr. Alexander Graham Bell personally thought that videotelephony was achievable even though his contributions to its advancement were incidental.&lt;ref name="Lange"&gt;Lange, André. [http://histv2.free.fr/bell/bellnotice.htm Histoire de la television: Les Contributions Indirectes d'Alexandre Graham Bell Au Developpement Des Rescherches Sur La Vision a Distance] {{Fr-icon}}, HistTV.free.fr website, March 2, 2003. Retrieved 15 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1891, Dr.  Bell actually did record conceptual notes on an 'electrical radiophone', which discussed the possibility of "seeing by electricity" using devices that employed [[tellurium]] or [[selenium]] imaging components.&lt;ref name="Bell-1891" /&gt; Bell wrote, decades prior to the invention of the [[image dissector]]:&lt;ref name="Bell-1891" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Graham Bell|Bell, Alexander Graham]]. [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/magbell:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28magbell37600601%29%29 Editorial and Articles on the Possibility of Seeing By Electricity, Beinn Bhreagh Recorder, 1910, March 22, 1910.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, when the first selenium speck is presented to an illuminated object, it may be possible that the eye in the darkened receiver, should perceive, not merely light, but an image of the object ...
}}

Bell went on to later predict that: "...the day would come when the man at the telephone would be able to see the distant person to whom he was speaking."&lt;ref name="Andberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-1927.04.08" /&gt; The discoveries in physics, chemistry and [[materials science]] underlying video technology would not be in place until the mid-1920s, first being utilized in [[mechanical television|electromechanical television]]. More practical 'all-electronic' video and television would not emerge until 1939, but would then suffer several more years of delays before gaining popularity due to the onset and effects of World War II.

[[File:France in XXI Century. Correspondance cinema.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's conception: 21st-century videotelephony imagined in the early 20th century (1910)]]

The compound name 'videophone' slowly entered into general usage after 1950,&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt; although 'video telephone' likely entered the lexicon earlier after ''video'' was coined in 1935.&lt;ref name="ED"/&gt; Prior to that time there appeared to be no standard terms for 'video telephone', with expressions such as 'sight-sound television system', 'visual radio' and nearly 20 others (in English) being used to describe the marriage of telegraph, telephone, television and radio technologies employed in early experiments.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-1930.04.13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-1930.04.10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT19270408a" /&gt;

Among the technological precursors to the videophone were telegraphic image transmitters created by several companies, such as the [[wirephoto]] used by [[Western Union]], and the ''teleostereograph'' developed by AT&amp;T's [[Bell Labs]],&lt;ref name="NYTimes-1924.05.20"/&gt; which were forerunners of today's [[fax|fax (facsimile) machines]]. Such early image transmitters were themselves based on previous work by Ernest Hummel and others in the 19th century. By 1927 AT&amp;T had created its earliest [[Mechanical television|electromechanical television-videophone]] called the ''ikonophone'' (from Greek: 'image-sound'),&lt;ref name="Outlook" /&gt; which operated at 18 frames per second and occupied half a room full of equipment cabinets.&lt;ref name="Mäkinen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns-1998" /&gt; An early U.S. test in 1927 had their then-Commerce Secretary [[Herbert Hoover]] address an audience in [[New York City]] from [[Washington, D.C.]]; although the audio portion was two-way, the video portion was one-way with only those in New York being able to see Hoover.

By 1930, AT&amp;T's 'two-way television-telephone' system was in full-scale experimental use.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT19270408a" /&gt; The [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|Bell Labs' Manhattan]] facility devoted years of research to it during the 1930s, led by Dr. [[Herbert Eugene Ives|Herbert Ives]] along with his team of more than 200 scientists, engineers and technicians, intending to develop it for both telecommunication and broadcast entertainment purposes.&lt;ref name="Burns2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BairdTelevision.com"/&gt;

There were also other public demonstrations of "two-way television-telephone" systems during this period by inventors and entrepreneurs who sought to compete with AT&amp;T, although none appeared capable of dealing with the technical issues of [[Image compression|signal compression]] that Bell Labs would eventually resolve. Signal compression, and its later sibling [[data compression]] were fundamental to the issue of transmitting the very large bandwidth of low-resolution black and white video through the very limited capacity of low-speed copper [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]]  telephone lines (higher resolution colour videophones would require even far greater capabilities).{{refn|One such demonstration that likely omitted any signal compression was performed in Mobile, Alabama on April 27, 1938. An Alabama news article reported that a "...technician of the American Television Institute, [promoted a videophone from a display booth for] the Roche Home Equipment Company... and through the medium of a scientific marvel... flashed a living picture over an ordinary telephone wire. Forming a practical insight into things that are to come, the television contrivance afforded a small, but clear, picture of speakers at each end of the wire."&lt;ref name="MobilePress" /&gt;|group="Note"}} After the Second World War, Bell Labs resumed its efforts during the 1950s and 1960s, eventually leading to AT&amp;T's Picturephone.

== World's first public videophone service: Germany 1936–1940 ==

In early 1936 the world's first public video telephone service, Germany's ''Gegensehn-Fernsprechanlagen'' (visual telephone system),  was developed by [[:de:Georg Oskar Schubert|Dr. Georg Schubert]], who headed the development department at the  ''Fernseh-AG'', a technical combine for television broadcasting technology.&lt;ref name="Vsee"&gt;[http://vsee.com/blog/a-missing-link-in-the-history-of-the-videophone/ A Missing Link in the History of the Videophone], Vsee.com blog website, June 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was opened by the German ''[[Reichspost]]'' (post office) between [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]], utilizing [[Coaxial cable|broadband coaxial cable]] to cover the distance of approximately 160&amp;nbsp;km (100 miles).

Schubert's system was based on Gunter Krawinkel's earlier research of the late-1920s that he displayed at the ''[[Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin|1929 Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin]]'' (Berlin International Radio Exposition).&lt;ref name="Zworykin 1958"&gt;

Then turning the device over, he will hear the voice of his friend and see his face on the screen, in color and in three dimensions.

The system's opening was inaugurated by the Minister of Posts [[Paul Freiherr von Eltz-Rübenach|Paul von Eltz-Rübenach]] in Berlin on March 1, 1936, who viewed and spoke with Leipzig's chief burgomaster.&lt;ref name="Burns3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StPetersburgIndepedent-1934.09.01" /&gt; It employed a [[Nipkow disk]] [[flying-spot scanner]] for its transmitter, and a [[cathode ray tube|cathode ray display tube]] with (an initial) resolution of 150 lines at its receiving-end videophone booth.&lt;ref name="Zworykin 1958" /&gt; The same coaxial cables were also used to distribute television programming.

In the initial service trial, broadband coaxial cable lines initially linked Berlin to Leipzig. After a period of experimentation the system entered public use and was soon extended another 160&amp;nbsp;km (100 miles) from Berlin to [[Hamburg]], and then in July 1938 from Leipzig to [[Nuremberg]] and [[Munich]].  The system eventually operated with more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;km (620 miles) of coaxial cable transmission lines. The videophones were integrated within large public videophone booths, with two booths provided per city. Calls between Berlin and Leipzig cost [[Reichsmark|RM]]3½, approximately one sixth of a [[Pound sterling|British pound sterling]], or about one-fifteenth of the average weekly wage.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt; The video telephone equipment used in Berlin was designed and built by the German Post Office Laboratory. Videophone equipment used in other German cities were developed by [[Fernseh|Fernseh A.G.]], partly owned by [[John Logie Baird|Baird Television Ltd.]] of the U.K.,&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt; inventors of the world's first functional television. During its life the German system underwent further development and testing, resulting in higher resolutions and a conversion to an all-electronic [[camera tube]] transmission system to replace its [[Nipkow disc|mechanical Nipkow scanning disc]].&lt;ref name="Zworykin 1958" /&gt; While the system's image quality was primitive by modern standards, it was deemed impressive in contemporary reports of the era, with users able to clearly discern the hands on wristwatches.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;

The special public videophone service was offered to the general public, which had to visit special post office ''Fernsehsprechstellen'' (video telephone booths, from "''far sight speech place''") simultaneously in their respective cities,&lt;ref name="Economist-2010.10.12" /&gt; but which at the same time also had [[Nazi]] political and [[propaganda|propagandistic]] overtones similar to the broadcasting of the [[1936 Summer Olympic Games|1936 Olympic Games]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Kasher-1992" /&gt; The German post office announced ambitious plans to extend their public videophone network to Cologne, Frankfurt and [[Vienna, Austria]], but expansion plans were discontinued in 1939 with the start of the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Burns4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SiemensHistory.website" /&gt; After Germany subsequently became fully engaged in the war its public videophone system was closed in 1940, with its expensive inter-city broadband cables converted to telegraphic message traffic and broadcast television service.&lt;ref name="Zworykin 1958" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mulbach-1995" /&gt;

A similar commercial post office system was also created in France during the late-1930s.&lt;ref name="Connected Earth-video from the phone" /&gt; The [[Deutsche Bundespost]] postal service would decades later develop and deploy its [[:de:BIGFON|BIGFON]] (Broadband Integrated Glass-Fiber Optical Network) [[videotelephony]] network from 1981 to 1988, serving several large German cities, and also created one of Europe's first public switched broadband services in 1989.&lt;ref name="Mulbach-1995b"/&gt;

== AT&amp;T Picturephone: 1964 ==

In the United States [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[Bell Labs]] conducted extensive research and development of videophones, eventually leading to public demonstrations of its trademarked Picturephone product and service in the 1960s. Its [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|large Manhattan experimental laboratory]] devoted years of technical research during the 1930s, led by Dr. [[Herbert Eugene Ives|Herbert Ives]] along with his team of more than 200 scientists, engineers and technicians.&lt;ref name="Burns2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BairdTelevision.com"/&gt; The Bell Labs early experimental model of 1930 had transmitted [[uncompressed video]] through multiple phone lines, a highly impractical and expensive method unsuitable for commercial use.&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T-Techchannel" /&gt;

During the mid-1950s, its laboratory work had produced another early test prototype capable of transmitting still images every two seconds over regular analog [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] telephone lines.&lt;ref name="New Electronics-2013.02.26"&gt;Boothroyd, David.

The more advanced Picturephone Mod I's early promotion included public evaluation displays at [[Disneyland]] and the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], with the first transcontinental videocall between the two venues made on April 20, 1964.&lt;ref name="BellTel-1964.3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BellLabs" /&gt; The first Picturephone 'Mod I' (Model No. 1) demonstration units used small oval housings on swivel stands, intended to stand on desks. Similar AT&amp;T Picturephone units were also featured at the [[Telephone Pavilion (Expo 67)|Telephone Pavilion]] (also called the "Bell Telephone Pavilion") at [[Expo 67]], an International World's Fair held in [[Montreal]], Canada in 1967.&lt;ref name="BellLabs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ExpoLounge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TSHWI" /&gt; Demonstration units were available at the fairs for the public to test, with fairgoers permitted to make videophone calls to volunteer recipients at other locations.

The United States would not see its first public videophone booths until 1964, when AT&amp;T installed their earliest commercial videophone units, the Picturephone "Mod I", in booths that were set up in New York's [[Grand Central Terminal]], Washington D.C., and Chicago.&lt;ref name="Mäkinen" /&gt; Its system was the result of decades of research and development at Bell Labs, its principal supplier, [[Western Electric]], plus other researchers working under contract to the Bell Labs.&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T-Techchannel"&gt;AT&amp;T.

&lt;/ref&gt;  However the use of reservation time slots and their cost of US$16 (Washington, D.C. to New York) to $27 (New York to Chicago) (equivalent to  $118 to $200 in 2012 dollars) for a three-minute call at the public videophone booths greatly limited their appeal resulting in their closure by 1968.&lt;ref name="Andberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mäkinen" /&gt;

Picturephones were also later installed in the offices of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] and [[Alcoa]] in Pittsburgh, as well as other technology companies in that city.&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T-Techchannel" /&gt; AT&amp;T's commercial service in Pittsburgh started on June 30, 1970 with 38 Picturephones at eight companies, at a lease rate of $160 per month ($947/month in 2012 dollars) for the service, which provided for 30 minutes of videocalling time per month, with extra minutes costing 25 cents each.{{refn|

Several uses of the Picturephone were novel and ahead of their time. At Alcoa in Pittsburgh, their Picturephone system was integrated into the company's corporate [[Information Technology]] system under its APRIS, or Alcoa Picturephone Remote Information System. APRIS let users retrieve information from Alcoa's databases, controlled by the buttons on their [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|touch-tone telephones]], with the data being presented on their Picturephone's video display, long before computer monitors came into popular use.&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T-Techchannel" /&gt;  AT&amp;T's Bell Labs would also soon experiment with multiple users on the same videocall, creating one of the earliest forms of [[videoconferencing]].|group="Note"}}

Color on AT&amp;T's Picturephone was not employed with their early models. These Picturephone units packaged [[Video camera tube#Plumbicon|Plumbicon]] cameras and small [[Cathode Ray Tube|CRT]] displays within their housings. The cameras were located atop their screens to help users see eye to eye. Later generation display screens were larger than in the original demonstration units, approximately six inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) square in a roughly cubical cabinet.

=== Picturephone technology ===
[[File:Eerste proef met beeldtelefoon Weeknummer 74-12 - Open Beelden - 23173.ogv|thumb|right|An experimental Philips videophone demonstration, Netherlands (1974 video, 1:23) {{Nl icon}}]]

The Picturephone's video bandwidth was 1 [[MegaHertz|MHz]] with a [[vertical scan rate]] of 30&amp;nbsp;Hz, [[horizontal scan rate]] of 8&amp;nbsp;kHz, and about 250 visible scan lines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  The equipment included a [[speakerphone]] (hands free telephone), with an added box to control picture transmission.  Each Picturephone line used three [[twisted pair]]s of ordinary telephone cable, two pairs for video and one for audio and signaling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://computerdesignsolutions.com/PicturePhone/index.html How to use your Picturephone]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cable amplifiers were spaced about a mile apart (1.6 kilometres) with built-in six-band adjustable [[Equalization (communications)|equalization]] filters.  For distances of more than a few miles, the signal was digitized at 2&amp;nbsp;MHz and 3 bits per sample [[Differential Pulse Code Modulation|DPCM]], and transmitted on a [[T-carrier#Higher T|T-2 carrier]].&lt;ref name="BellLabs"/&gt;

The original Picturephone system used contemporary crossbar and multi-frequency operation.  Lines and trunks were six wire, one pair each way for video and one pair two way for audio.  MF address signaling on the audio pair was supplemented by a Video Supervisory Signal (VSS) looping around on the video quad to ensure continuity. More complex protocols were later adopted for conferencing.&lt;ref name="BellLabs"/&gt;

To deploy Picturephone service, new wideband [[crossbar switch]]es were designed and installed into the [[Bell System|Bell System's]] [[5XB switch]] offices, this being the most widespread of the relatively modern kind.&lt;ref name="BellLabs" /&gt; Hundreds of technicians attended schools to learn to operate the Cable Equalizer Test Set and other equipment, and to install Picturephones.

=== Lack of Picturephone success ===

At the time of its first launch, AT&amp;T foresaw a hundred thousand Picturephones in use across the Bell System by 1975. However, by the end of July 1974, only five Picturephones were being leased in Pittsburgh, and U.S.-wide there were only a few hundred, mostly in Chicago.&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T-Techchannel" /&gt; Unrelated difficulties at [[1975 New York Telephone Exchange fire|New York Telephone]] also slowed AT&amp;T's efforts, and few customers signed up for the service in either city. At its peak Picturephone service had only about 500 subscribers, with the service fading away through the 1970s.

AT&amp;T's initial Picturephone 'Mod I' (Model No. 1) and then its upgraded 'Mod II' programs, were a continuation of its many years of prior research during the 1920s, 1930s, late 1940s and 1950s. Both Picturephone programs, like their experimental AT&amp;T predecessors, were researched principally at its [[Bell Labs]], formally spanned some 15 years and consumed more than US$500 million,{{refn|

The $500M figure is attributed only to the AT&amp;T and Bell Labs' 15 year program covering its Picturephone Mod I and Mod II versions.  Earlier videotelephony programs during the later half of the 1920s, 1930s, late 1940s and 1950s, plus the AT&amp;T VideoPhone 2500 model program of the late 1980s led to a cumulative cost which approached, by some estimates, one billion dollars in total for all videotelephony development.

|group="Note"}} eventually meeting with commercial failure.&lt;ref name="EncyclopædiaBritannica" /&gt; AT&amp;T concluded that its early Picturephone was a "concept looking for a market"&lt;ref name="EncyclopædiaBritannica"/&gt;  and discontinued its 'Mod II' service in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="EncyclopædiaBritannica" /&gt;

=== Later development ===

AT&amp;T would later market its VideoPhone 2500 to the general public from 1992 to 1995&lt;ref name="Silberg"&gt;Silberg, Lurie. "''Here's Looking At You! AT&amp;T, Sharp Sign 3-Year Contract To Jointly Develop Videophone Technology''", HFN The Weekly Newspaper For The Home Furnishing Network, February 6, 1995, Vol. 69.6, p. 76. Gale Document No.: GALE|A16415691.&lt;/ref&gt; with prices starting at [[United States dollar|US$]]1,500 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500|1992|r=-1}}}} in current dollars){{Inflation-fn|US}} and later dropping to $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1993|r=-1}}}} in current dollars), marketed by its Global VideoPhone Systems unit.&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt; The VideoPhone 2500 was designed to provide low-frame rate compressed color video on ordinary [[Plain old telephone service|Plain Old Telephone Service]] (POTS) lines, circumventing the significantly higher cost [[ADSL]] telephone service lines used by several other videoconferencing manufacturers. It was limited by analog phone line connection speeds of about 19 Kilobits per second, the video portion being 11,200 bit/s, and with a maximum frame rate of 10 frames per second, but typically much slower, as low as a third of a video frame per second.  The VideoPhone 2500 used proprietary technology protocols, including AT&amp;T's Global VideoPhone Standard (GVS).&lt;ref name="Silberg" /&gt; Again, AT&amp;amp;T met with very little commercial success, selling only about 30,000 units, mainly outside the United States.&lt;ref name="Silberg"/&gt;

Despite AT&amp;T's various videophone products meeting with commercial failure, they were widely viewed as technical successes which expanded the limits of the telecommunications sciences in several areas. Its videotelephony programs were critically acclaimed for their technical brilliance and even the novel uses they experimented with. The research and development programs conducted by Bell Labs were highly notable for their beyond-the-state-of-the-art results produced in [[materials science]], advanced [[telecommunication]]s, [[microelectronic]]s and [[information technology|information technologies]].

AT&amp;T's published research additionally helped pave the way for other companies to later enter the field of [[videoconferencing]]. The company's videophones also generated significant media coverage in science journals, the general news media and in popular culture. The image of a futuristic [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwo6JpMceg AT&amp;T videophone being casually used] in the science fiction film [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']], became iconic of both the movie and, arguably, the public's general view of the future.

== Other early videophones: 1968–1999 ==
{{expand list|date=December 2012}}

Beginning in the late 1960s, several countries worldwide sought to compete with AT&amp;T's advanced development of its Picturephone service in the United States. However such projects were research and capital intensive, and fraught with difficulties in being deployed commercially. This time period also saw the research, development and commercial roll-out of what would become powerful video compression and decompression software [[codec]]s, which would eventually lead to low cost [[videotelephony]] in the early 2000s.

=== France ===
[[File:Videophone IMG 1107-white.jpg|thumb|right |The French Matra videophone (1970)]]

France's post office telecommunications branch had earlier set up a commercial videophone system similar to the German ''[[Reichspost]]'' public videophone system of the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="Connected Earth-video from the phone" /&gt;  In 1972 the defense and electronics manufacturer [[Matra]] was one of three French companies that sought to develop advanced videophones in the early 1970s, spurred by the AT&amp;T's Picturephone in the United States. Initial plans by Matra included the deployment of 25 units to France's [[Centre national d'études des télécommunications]] (CNET of [[France Télécom]]) for their internal use. CNET intended to guide its initial use towards the business sector, to be later followed by personal home usage. Its estimated unit cost in 1971 was the equivalent of £325, with a monthly usage subscription charge of £3.35.&lt;ref name="NewScientist-1971.07.15" /&gt;

Studies of applications of [[videotelephony]] were conducted by CNET in France in 1972, with its first commercial applications for videophones appearing in 1984. The delay was due to the problem of insufficient bandwidth, with 2 Mb per second being required for transmitting both video and audio signals. The problem was solved worldwide by the creation of software for data encoding and compression via [[video codecs|video coding and decoding algorithms]], also known as codecs.

=== Japan ===

In Japan the ''Lumaphone'' was developed and marketed by Mitsubishi in 1985. The project was originally started by the Ataritel division of the [[Atari|Atari Video Game Company]] in 1983 under the direction of Atari's Steve Bristow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130118121521/http://www.atarimuseum.com/ataritel/index.html AtariTel], Atari History Society webpage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Atari then sold its division to [[Mitsubishi Electric]] in 1984. The Lumaphone was marketed by Mitsubishi Electric of America in 1986 as the Luma LU-1000, costing US$1,500,
&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics-1988.02" /&gt; designed with a small black and white video display, approximately {{convert|4|cm|in}} in size, and a video camera adjacent to the display which could be blocked with a sliding door for privacy.  Although promoted as a 'videophone', it operated similar to [[Bell Labs]]' early experimental image transfer phone of 1956, transmitting still images every 3–5 seconds over analog [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] lines. It could also be hooked up to a printer or connected to a regular TV or monitor for improved [[teleconferencing]].&lt;ref name="DigicamHistory.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AtariMuseum2" /&gt;

[[File:Kyocera VP-210 CP+ 2011.jpg|thumb | upright | left | The Kyocera VP-210 Visual Phone was the first commercial mobile videophone. The [[Personal Handy-phone System]] (PHS) phone was introduced in Japan (1999).]]

Mitsubishi also marketed its lower-cost VisiTel LU-500 image phone in 1988 costing about US$400, aimed at the consumer market. It came with reduced capabilities but had with a larger black and white display.  Other Japanese electronic manufacturers marketed similar image transfer phones during the late-1980s, including Sony's PCT-15 (US$500), and two models from Panasonic, its WG-R2 (US$450) and its KX-TV10 (US$500).&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics-1988.02"&gt;Booth, Stephen A.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=geMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 Telephony With Pictures], ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', January 1989, pp. 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later the [[Kyocera|Kyocera Corporation]], an electronics manufacturer based in Kyoto, conducted a two-year development campaign from 1997 to 1999 that resulted in the release of the VP-210 VisualPhone,  the world's first mobile colour videophone that also doubled as a [[camera phone]] for still photos.&lt;ref name="S&amp;S"&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10321681&amp;screenwidth=1366 Kyocera visual phone VP-210, Japan, 1999], Science &amp; Society Picture Library, retrieved August 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-1999.05.18"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/TECH/ptech/9905/18/japan.phonetv/ First mobile videophone introduced], [[CNN|CNN.com]] website, May 18, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The camera phone was the same size as similar contemporary [[mobile phone]]s, but sported a large camera lens and a 5&amp;nbsp;cm (2 inch) colour [[Thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display|TFT display]] capable of displaying 65,000 colors, and was able to process two video frames per second. The 155 gram (5.5 oz.) camera could also take 20 photos and convey them by e-mail, with the camera phone retailing at the time for 40,000 yen, about US$325 in 1999.&lt;ref name="CNN-1999.05.18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Computerworld-2012.05.11"&gt;Yegulalp, Serdar. [http://www.computerworld.com/slideshow/detail/45496 Camera phones: A look back and forward], ''[[Computerworld]]'', May 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The VP-210 was released in May 1999 and used its single front-facing 110,000-pixel camera to send two images per second through Japan's PHS mobile phone network system. Although its frame rate was crude and its memory is considered tiny in the present day, the phone was viewed as "revolutionary" at the time of its release.&lt;ref name="Computerworld-2012.05.11" /&gt;

The Kyocera project was initiated at their Yokohama research and development center by Kazumi Saburi, one of their section managers. His explanation for the project was "Around that time, cellular handsets with enabled voice and SMS communication capabilities were considered to be just one among many personal communication tools. One day a simple idea hit us - 'What if we were able to enjoy talking with the intended person watching his/her face on the display?' We were certain that such a device would make cell phone communications much more convenient and enjoyable."&lt;ref name="TomsGuide-2005"&gt;[http://www.tomsguide.com/us/desperately-seeking-saburi,review-595.html Desperately Seeking Saburi: Finding the Camera Phone Creator], TomsGuide.com website, November 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saburi also stated that their R&amp;D section had "nourished [the idea] for several years before" they received project approval from their top management which had encourage such forward-thinking research, because they "also believed that such a product would improve Kyocera's brand image."  Their research showed that a "cell phone with a camera and color display provided a completely new value for users, It could be used as a phone, a camera and a photo album".&lt;ref name="TomsGuide-2005" /&gt;

Technical challenges handled by about a dozen engineers at Kyocera over the two year development period included the camera module's placement within the phone at a time when electronic components had not been fully reduced in size, as well as increasing its data transmission rate.  After its release the mobile video-camera phone was commercially successful, spawning several other competitors such as the [[Willcom|DDI Pocket]], and one from [[SoftBank Mobile|Vodafone K.K.]]&lt;ref name="TomsGuide-2005" /&gt;

=== Sweden ===
[[File:Tage Erlander 1960-tal.jpg|thumb|right|Swedish Prime Minister [[Tage Erlander]] using an Ericsson videophone to speak with [[Lennart Hyland]], a popular TV show host (1969)]]

In Sweden, electronics maker [[Ericsson]] began developing a videophone in the mid-1960s, intending to market it to government, institutions, businesses and industry, but not to consumers due to AT&amp;T's lack of success in that market segment. Tests were conducted in [[Stockholm]], including trial communications in banking. Ultimately Ericsson chose not to proceed with further production.&lt;ref name="EricssonHistory.com" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

In 1970 the British [[General Post Office]] had 16 demonstration models of its Viewphone built, meant to be the equivalent to AT&amp;T's Picturephone.&lt;ref name="New Scientist-1966.11.24"&gt;"A Viewphone Service", ''[[New Scientist]]'',  November 24, 1966, № 440/3.&lt;/ref&gt; Their initial attempt at a first generation commercial videophone later led to the [[BT Group|British Telecom]] Relate 2000, which was released for sale in 1993, costing between £400-£500 each. The Relate 2000 featured a {{convert|74|mm}} flip-up colour LCD display screen operating at a nominal rate of 8 video frames per second, which could be depressed to 3-4 frames per second if the PSTN bandwidth was limited. In the era prior to low-cost, high-speed broadband service, its video quality was found to be generally poor by the public with images shifting jerkily between frames, due to British phone lines that generally provided less than 3.4&amp;nbsp;kHz of bandwidth.&lt;ref name="New Electronics-2013.02.26" /&gt;   British Telecom had initially expected the device, manufactured by [[Marconi Electronic Systems|Marconi Electronics]], to sell at a rate of 10,000 per year, but its actual sales were minimal.&lt;ref name="Connected Earth-video from the phone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Times-1993.03.26"&gt;Nuttall, Nick.

{{Further|Video relay service}}

Significant improvements in [[videotelephony|video call]] quality of service for the [[Hearing loss|deaf]] occurred in the United States in 2003 when [[Sorenson Media|Sorenson Media Inc.]] (formerly Sorenson Vision), a video compression software coding company, developed its VP-100 model stand-alone videophone specifically for the [[Deaf culture|deaf community]].  It was designed to output its video to the user's television in order to lower the cost of acquisition, and to offer remote control and a powerful [[Sorenson codec|video compression codec]] for unequaled video quality and ease of use with a video relay service (VRS). Favourable reviews quickly led to its popular usage at educational facilities for the deaf, and from there to the greater deaf community.&lt;ref name="New York Times-2003.12.18"&gt;Fitzgerald, Thomas J. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/18/technology/for-the-deaf-communication-without-the-wait.html For the Deaf, Communication Without the Wait], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 18, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coupled with similar high-quality videophones introduced by other electronics manufacturers, the [[Broadband Internet access|availability of high speed Internet]], and [[Video relay service#U.S. VRS regulation|sponsored video relay services]] authorized by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] in 2002, VRS services for the deaf underwent rapid growth in that country.&lt;ref name="New York Times-2003.12.18" /&gt;

'''Horizontal scan rate''', or horizontal frequency, usually expressed in [[Hertz|kilohertz]], is the [[frequency]] at which a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] moves the electron beam from the left side of the display to the right and back, and therefore describes the number of horizontal lines displayed per second.  CRT timings include some horizontal scans before the visible display, after it, and during the travel from bottom to top (known as vertical back porch, vertical front porch, and vertical sync width, respectively, and collectively known as [[Vertical blanking interval|vertical blank time]]), so the horizontal scan rate does not directly correlate to visible display lines, unless the unseen lines are also known, but it can still be used to approximate the display lines, as the total blank time is usually a small but significant portion of the total lines.

It is usually the most limiting factor of a CRT display.  This limit is due to how quickly the electromagnetic deflection system can reverse the current flowing in the horizontal deflection coil in order to move the electron beam from one side of the display to the other.  Reversing the current more quickly requires higher voltages, which requires more expensive electrical components.  The percentage of time allowed by the standard was chosen to allow practical TV receiver designs.

Compare vertical scan rate ([[refresh rate]]), which indicates how often the electron beam is moved from the bottom of the display to the top. Given the horizontal scan rate, the refresh rate can be approximated by dividing the horizontal scan rate by the number of horizontal lines multiplied by 1.05 (since about 5% of the time it takes to scan the screen is spent moving the electron beam back to the top). For instance, a monitor with a horizontal scanning frequency of 96&amp;nbsp;kHz at a resolution of 1280 x 1024 has a refresh rate of 96,000 / (1024 x 1.05) ≈ 89&amp;nbsp;Hz (rounded down).

In [[analog television]] systems the horizontal frequency is between 15.625 kHz and 15.750 kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=PAL, NTSC and SECAM Comparisons |publisher=High-Tech Productions.com |url=http://www.high-techproductions.com/pal,ntsc.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
*[[Computer display standard|Display Mode]] at 1280x1024 @ 60Hz means it draws 1024 lines x 60 per second
*Taking [[Vertical blanking interval]] into account, it draws 1024x1.05 lines for a full frame cycle
*Therefore, it draws 1024x1.05x60 lines per second = 1 line per 1/(1024x1.05x60) second 
*Horizontal scan rate: 1/(1024x1.05x60) sec ~= 1.55009921E-5 sec or 64.512 kHz

A '''hospital bed''' or '''hospital cot''' is a bed specially designed for hospitalized patients or others in need of some form of health care. These beds have special features both for the comfort and well-being of the patient and for the convenience of health care workers. Common features include adjustable height for the entire bed, the head, and the feet, adjustable side rails, and electronic buttons to operate both the bed and other nearby electronic devices.

Hospital beds and other similar types of beds such as [[nursing care bed]]s are used not only in hospitals, but in other health care facilities and settings, such as [[nursing home]]s, [[assisted living]] facilities, [[outpatient clinic]]s, and in [[home health care]].

While the term "hospital bed" can refer to the actual bed, the term "bed" is also used to describe the amount of space in a health care facility, as the capacity for the number of patients at the facility is measured in available "beds."

==History==
Beds with adjustable side rails first appeared in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] some time between 1815 and 1825.&lt;ref name="askdeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askdeb.com/health/bed/|title=Who Invented The Hospital Bed?|publisher=askdeb.com|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874 the mattress company Andrew Wuest and Son, Cincinnati, Ohio, registered a patent for a type of mattress frame with a hinged head that could be elevated, a predecessor of the modern day hospital bed.&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Bedding Manufacturers, March 1964, Nation's Oldest Family-Held Bedding Firm: Adam Wuest, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern 3-segment adjustable hospital bed was invented by [[Willis Dew Gatch]], chair of the Department of Surgery at the [[Indiana University School of Medicine]], in the early 20th century. This type of bed is sometimes referred to as the '''Gatch Bed'''.&lt;ref name="askdeb"/&gt;

The modern push-button hospital bed was invented in 1945, and it originally included a built-in toilet in hopes of eliminating the [[bedpan]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=LIFE|publisher=Time Inc|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ksEAAAAMBAJ|page=92|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern features==
[[File:Inauguración del Hospital Regional de Apatzingán. (20503993770).jpg|225px|thumbnail|Hospital beds at the ''Hospital Regional de Apatzingán'' in [[Apatzingán]], [[Michoacán]], Mexico.]]

===Wheels===
Wheels enable easy movement of the bed, either within parts of the facility in which they are located, or within the room. Sometimes movement of the bed a few inches to a few feet may be necessary in patient care.

Wheels are lockable. For safety, wheels can be locked when transferring the patient in or out of the bed.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Perioperative Patient Care: The Nursing Perspective|author1=Kneedler, J.A.|author2=Dodge, G.H.|date=1994|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9780867206425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LDEZyZD36hYC|page=215|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elevation===
Beds can be raised and lowered at the head, feet, and their entire height. While on older beds this is done with cranks usually found at the foot of the bed, on modern beds this feature is electronic.

Today, while a fully electric bed has many features that are electronic, a ''semi-electric bed'' has two motors, one to raise the head, and the other to raise the foot.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Guide for Patients and Families:Third Edition|author=Mitsumoto, H.|date=2009|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|isbn=9781935281191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7fsEN7YDZoC|page=125|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raising the head (known as a [[Fowler's position]]) can provide some benefits to the patient, the staff, or both. The Fowler's position is used for sitting the patient upright for feeding or certain other activities, or in some patients, can ease [[breathing]], or may be beneficial to the patient for other reasons.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt;

Raising the feet can help ease movement of the patient toward the headboard and may also be necessary for certain conditions.

Raising and lowering the height of the bed can help bring the bed to a comfortable level for the patient to get in and out of bed, or for caregivers to work with the patient.

===Side rails===
Beds have side rails that can be raised or lowered. These rails, which serve as protection for the patient and sometimes can make the patient feel more secure, can also include the buttons used for their operation by staff and patients to move the bed, call the nurse, or even control the television.&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nursing Assistant: A Nursing Process Approach|author1=Hegner, B.R.|author2=Acello, B.|author3=Caldwell, E.|date=2004|publisher=Delmar Learning|isbn=9781401806330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B1BobaC-vLAC|page=203|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of different types of side rails to serve different purposes. While some are simply to prevent patient falls, others have equipment that can aid the patient themself without physically confining the patient to bed.

Side rails, if not built properly, can be of risk for patient entrapment. In the [[United States]], more than 300 deaths were reported as a result of this between 1985 and 2004.&lt;ref name="consumeraffairs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/hospital_beds.html|title=FDA Proposes Hospital Bed Entrapment Rules|publisher=consumeraffairs.com|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] has set guidelines regarding the safety of side rails.&lt;ref name="kendaloutreach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ute.kendaloutreach.org/learning/HospitalBedSafetyWorkgroupHBSW.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622234230/http://ute.kendaloutreach.org/learning/HospitalBedSafetyWorkgroupHBSW.aspx |archive-date=2006-06-22 |dead-url=yes |title=Hospital Bed Safety (HBSW) |accessdate=2015-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, use of the rails may require a [[physician's order]] (depending on local laws and the policies of the facility where they are used) as rails may be considered a form of [[medical restraint]].

===Tilting===
Some advanced beds are equipped with columns which help tilt the bed to 15-30 degrees on each side. Such tilting can help prevent pressure ulcers for the patient, and help caregivers to do their daily tasks with less of a risk of back injuries.

===Bed exit alarm===
Many modern hospital beds are able to feature a bed exit alarm whereby a pressure pad on or in the mattress arms an audible alert when a weight such as a patient is placed on it, and activating the full alarm once this weight is removed. This is helpful to hospital staff or caregivers monitoring any number of patients from a distance (such as a nurse's station) as the alarm will trigger in the event of a patient (especially the elderly or memory impaired) falling out of the bed or wandering off unsupervised. This alarm can be emitted solely from the bed itself or connected to the nurse call bell/light or hospital phone/paging system.
Also some beds can feature a multi-zone bed exit alarm which can alert the staff when the patient start moving in the bed and before the actual exit which is necessary for some cases.

===CPR function===
In the event of the bed occupant suddenly requiring [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]], some hospital beds offer a CPR function in the form of a button or lever which when activated flatten the bed platform and put it in lowest height and deflates and flattens the bed's air mattress (if installed) creating a flat hard surface necessary for effective CPR administration.

===Specialist beds===
Many specialist hospital beds are also produced in order to effectively treat different injuries. These include standing beds, turning beds and legacy beds. These are usually used to treat back and spinal injuries as well as severe trauma.

==Disadvantages==

===Cost===
A hospital bed can cost over $1000.00&amp;nbsp;USD; on average with different costs associated with completely manual functions, 2-motor functions and fully electric 3-motor functions (whole bed going up and down). Other costs are associated with bariatric heavy duty models that also offer extra width.&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety|author=Stellman, J.M.|date=1998|publisher=International Labour Office|isbn=9789221092032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ceuq9P4hLJMC|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on health of patients===
Hospital beds can make a patient's spine more rounded because a patient who sits up a lot, such as when watching television, tends to slip down.&lt;ref name="google6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Back Care Basics: A Doctor's Gentle Yoga Program for Back and Neck Pain Relief|author=Schatz, M.P.|date=1992|publisher=Rodmell Press|isbn=9780962713828|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0J-wdld5d8EC|page=24|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the category A bed manufacturers are providing their beds with built-in function which act as anti-slip. LINET is providing Ergoframe while others got different names.&lt;ref name="ergoframe"&gt;{{cite web|title=ERGOFRAME - Trademark Details|author=JUSTIA|date=2008|publisher=JUSTIA|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/790/57/ergoframe-79057269.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
During the 1980s, patient safety had been a concern with hospital beds.

In 1982, a 3-year-old Milwaukee girl hospitalized for [[pneumonia]] was killed when crushed by a mechanical hospital bed.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, Jan 15, 1982 Girl, 3, Killed by Mechanical Hospital Bed, Her Family Says&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, an 11-year-old Illinois boy was strangled to death by a hospital bed.&lt;ref&gt;The Sun Baltimore, Md. Apr 19, 1983 Illinois boy, 11, strangled in hospital-bed accident&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2180">'''House R 128''' ('''Sobek House''') is a [[Modern_architecture|modernist]] single-family [[house]] in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]], built by [[architect]] [[Werner Sobek]] in 1999/2000.
The house features a [[modular home|modular]] and [[recyclable]] design, is completely [[glazing in architecture|glazed]] and has no interior dividing walls.
It is computerized and meets its own energy requirements completely.

== Overview ==

The name of the house is derived from its location at Römerstrasse 128, which is a small and steep piece of land at the edge of the [[River valley|vale]] of [[Stuttgart]]. When the house was built, it was paid a great amount of attention in the architectural world. The building is shaped like a [[cube]], has four levels and is wrapped by a glass shield. All components can be segregated for recycling. There are no walls or closed rooms (apart from the [[bathroom]]s) and only few pieces of [[furniture]]. The transparency is supposed to create the impression that one lives outdoors exposed to [[nature]]. Owing to its [[passive solar]] architecture with triple-glazed walls, the house needs no energy for [[heating]].
Seasonal temperature shifts are balanced by a [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|seasonal thermal energy store]].
[[Electricity]] is generated by [[solar cell]]s.
Every item in the house is computer-controlled.

'''Hydraulically activated pipeline pigging''' (HAPP) is a [[pigging]] technology applied for [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] cleaning. The basic principle is that a pressure drop is created over a by-passable pig held back against a pipeline's fluid flow. The pipeline fluid passing through the pigs cleaning head is accelerated by this pressure drop, forming strong cleaning jets. These jets are directed onto the inner wall in front of the pig, removing all kinds of deposits.

==Introduction to pipeline pigging==
[[Pipeline transport|Pipeline]] pigs are devices that are inserted into and travel throughout the length of a pipeline driven by the product flow. They were originally developed to remove deposits which could obstruct or retard flow through a pipeline (Fig. 1). Today pigs are used during all phases in the life of a pipeline for many different reasons.
[[Image:Cleaning pig in a pipeline.png|thumb|500px|center|Fig. 1 Cleaning pig in a pipeline]]

[[Image:Classification of pipeline pigs.png|thumb|400px|right|Fig. 2 Classification of pipeline pigs]]
Pigs used today can be divided into three categories (Fig. 2):
* '''Utility Pigs''', are used to perform functions such as cleaning, separating, or dewatering.
* '''In Line Inspection (ILI) Tools''', provide information on the condition of the line, as well as the extent and location of any problems.
* '''Gel Pigs''', are used in conjunction with conventional pigs to optimize pipeline dewatering, cleaning, and drying tasks.
Generally for cleaning pigs, the cleaning force applied is the mechanical force between the pipe inner wall and the cleaning pig itself. This force is determined by the pig travel speed as well as by the hardness and shape of the cleaning edge: The faster the pig, the higher the cleaning impact on the deposits, but at the same time only the surface of the debris is scratched away. Therefore several, sometimes many, pig runs are required to clean a pipeline.

Hydraulically activated pigs apply high pressure liquid jets either supplied by high pressure hoses (depended) or made available by the kinetic energy locally available. Depended hydraulically activated pigs are limited in reach due to the hose which needs to be inserted into the pipeline and guides the cleaning head.

==HAPP principle==
[[Image:Cleaning HAPP.png|thumb|400px|right|Fig. 3 Components of a hydraulically activated power pig]]
A hydraulically activated pig consists of three units (Fig. 3): a brake unit, a seal unit and the cleaning head.

All units have openings that allow the entire fluid flow through the pipeline to bypass. The brake unit ensures that a hydraulically activated pig is held back against the fluid flow in the pipeline. The fluid pushes against the following seal unit, which channels it into the openings of the cleaning head. The seal unit and cleaning head restrict the flow, resulting in a pressure difference across the pig. Thus, the fluid is accelerated in the cleaning head's nozzles, creating extremely powerful liquid jets. These jets are directed onto the pipe inner wall to remove any kind of deposits.

The brake unit ensures that the travel speed of the pig is much slower than the fluid velocity, thus allowing it to entirely remove deposits from the pipe wall before it travels across the cleaned surface. The deposits removed are immediately flushed down the pipeline with the main jet of the cleaning head which is directed to the middle of the pipeline. With all deposits removed from the pipe wall and transported downstream by the fluid flow there remains no risk of the pig getting stuck in debris accumulated in front of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9249">A '''hyperaccumulator''' is a plant capable of growing in soils with very high concentrations of [[metal]]s, absorbing these metals through their roots, and concentrating extremely high levels of metals in their tissues.&lt;ref name=Rascio&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rascio|first=Nicoletta|author2=Navari-Izzo, Flavia|title=Heavy metal hyperaccumulating plants: How and why do they do it?

Compared to non-hyperaccumulating species, hyperaccumulator roots extract the metal from the soil at a higher rate, transfer it more quickly to their shoots, and store large amounts in leaves and roots.&lt;ref name=Rascio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hossner|first=L.R.|author2=Loeppert, R.H. |author3=Newton, R.J. |author4=Szaniszlo, P.J. |title=Literature review: Phytoaccumulation of chromium, uranium, and plutonium in plant systems|journal=Amarillo National Resource Center for Plutonium, TX (United States) Technical Report|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to hyperaccumulate toxic metals compared to related species has been shown to be due to differential [[gene expression]] and [[gene regulation|regulation]] of the same [[gene]]s in both plants.&lt;ref name=Rascio /&gt; Over 500 species of [[flowering plant]]s have been identified as having the ability to hyperaccumulate metals in their tissues.&lt;ref name=Sarma&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarma|first=Hemen|title=Metal hyperaccumuulation in plants: A Review focusing on phytoremediation technology|journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Technology|year=2011|volume=4|issue=2|pages=118–138|doi=10.3923/jest.2011.118.138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperaccumulating plants hold interest for their ability to extract metals from the soils of contaminated sites ([[phytoremediation]]) to return the ecosystem to a less toxic state. The plants also hold potential to be used to mine metals from soils with very high concentrations ([[phytomining]]) by growing the plants then harvesting them for the metals in their tissues.&lt;ref name=Rascio /&gt;

The genetic advantage of hyperaccumulation of metals may be that the toxic levels of heavy metals in leaves deter [[herbivore]]s or increase the toxicity of other anti-herbivory metabolites.&lt;ref name=Rascio /&gt;

==Genetic basis==

Several gene families are involved in the processes of hyperaccumulation including upregulation of absorption and sequestration of heavy metal metals.&lt;ref name="Rascio, Nicoletta 2011"&gt;Rascio, Nicoletta, and Flavia Navari-Izzo. "Heavy metal hyperaccumulating plants: how and why do they do it? And what makes them so interesting?." Plant science 180.2 (2011): 169-181.&lt;/ref&gt; These hyperaccumulation genes (HA genes) are found in over 450 plant species, including the model organisms ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' and [[Brassicaceae]]. The expression of such genes is used to determine whether a species is capable of hyperaccumulation.  Expression of HA genes provides the plant with capacity to uptake and sequester metals such as As, Co, Fe, Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg, Se, Mn, Zn, Mo and Ni in 100–1000x the concentration found in sister species or populations.&lt;ref name="C. Pagliano, 2006 pp. 70"&gt;C. Pagliano, et al. Evidence for PSII-donor-side damage and photoinhibition induced by cadmium treatment on rice (Oryza sativa L.)J. Photochem. Photobiol. B: Biol., 84 (2006), pp. 70–78&lt;/ref&gt;

The capacity for hyperaccumulation is dependent on two major factors: environmental exposure and expression of members of the ZIP gene family.
Although experiments have shown that the hyperaccumulation is partially dependent on environmental exposure (i.e. only plants exposed to a metal are observed with high concentrations of that metal), hyperaccumulation is ultimately dependent on the presence and upregulation of genes involved with that process. It has been shown that hyperaccumulation capacities can be inherited in ''[[Thlaspi caerulescens]]'' (Brassicaceae) and others. As there is wide variety among hyperaccumulating species that span across different plant families, it is likely that HA genes were ecotypically selected for. 
In most hyperaccumulating plants, the main mechanism for metal transport are the proteins coded by genes in the ZIP family, however other families such as the HMA, MATE, YSL and MTP families have also been observed to be involved. The ZIP gene family is a novel, plant-specific gene family that encodes Cd, Mn, Fe and Zn transporters. The ZIP family plays a role in supplying Zn to metalloproteins.&lt;ref name="Poschenrieder C. 2006"&gt;Poschenrieder C., Tolrá R., Barceló J. (2006). Can metals defend plants against biotic stress? Trends Plant Sci. 11 288–295 &lt;/ref&gt;

In one study on ''Arabidopsis'', it was found that the metallophyte ''[[Arabidopsis halleri]]'' expressed a member of the ZIP family that was not expressed in a non-metallophytic sister species. This gene was an iron regulated transporter (IRT-protein) that encoded several primary transporters involved with cellular uptake of cations above the concentration gradient. When this gene was transformed into yeast, hyperaccumulation was observed.&lt;ref name="Becher, Martina 2004"&gt;Becher, Martina, et al. "Cross‐species microarray transcript profiling reveals high constitutive expression of metal homeostasis genes in shoots of the zinc hyperaccumulator ''Arabidopsis halleri''." The Plant Journal 37.2 (2004): 251-268.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that overexpression of ZIP family genes that encode cation transporters is a characteristic genetic feature of hyperaccumulation. 
Another gene family that has been observed ubiquitously in hyperaccumulators are the ZTP and ZNT families. A study on T. caerulescens identified the ZTP family as a plant specific family with high sequence similarity to other zinc transporter4. Both the ZTP and ZNT families, like the ZIP family, are zinc transporters.&lt;ref name="Persans, Michael W. 2001"&gt;Persans, Michael W., Ken Nieman, and David E. Salt. "Functional activity and role of cation-efflux family members in Ni hyperaccumulation in Thlaspi goesingense." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 98.17 (2001): 9995-10000&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in hyperaccumulating species, that these genes, specifically ZNT1 and ZNT2 alleles are chronically overexpressed.&lt;ref name="Assunção, A. G. L. 2001"&gt;Assunção, A. G. L., et al. "Elevated expression of metal transporter genes in three accessions of the metal hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens." Plant, Cell &amp; Environment 24.2 (2001): 217-226.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exact mechanism by which these genes facilitate hyperaccumulation is not yet characterized, expression patterns correlate heavily with individual hyperaccumulation capacity and metal exposure, suggesting these gene families play a regulatory role.  As the presence and expression zinc transporter gene families are highly prevalent in hyperaccumulators, the capacity to accumulate a wide range of heavy metals is likely due to an inability of the zinc transporters to discriminate against certain metal ions. The response of the plants to hyperaccumulation of any metal also supports this theory as it has been observed that AhHMHA3 is expressed in hyperaccumulating individuals. AhHMHA3 has been identified to be expressed in response to and aid of Zn detoxification.&lt;ref name="C. Pagliano, 2006 pp. 70"/&gt; In another study, using metallophytic and non-metallophytic ''Arabidopsis'' populations, back crosses indicated [[pleiotropy]] between Cd and Zn tolerances.&lt;ref name="Bert, V. 2003"&gt;Bert, V., Meerts, P., Saumitou-Laprade, P. et al. Plant and Soil (2003) 249: 9. doi:10.1023/A:1022580325301&lt;/ref&gt;  This response suggests that plants are unable to detect specific metals, and that hyperaccumulation is likely a result of an overexpressed Zn transportation system.&lt;ref name="Pollard, A. J 1996"&gt;Pollard, A. J. and BAKER, A. J.M. (1996), Quantitative genetics of zinc hyperaccumulation in Thlaspi caerulescens. New Phytologist, 132: 113–118. doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.1996.tb04515.x&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall effect of these expression patterns has been hypothesized to assist in plant defense systems. In one hypothesis, "the elemental defense hypothesis", provided by Poschenrieder, it is suggested that the expression of these genes assist in [[antiherbivory]] or pathogen defenses by making tissues toxic to organisms attempting to feed on that plant.&lt;ref name="Poschenrieder C. 2006"/&gt; Another hypothesis, "the joint hypothesis", provided by Boyd, suggests that expression of these genes assists in systemic defense.&lt;ref name="Boyd R. S. 2012"&gt;Boyd R. S. (2012). Plant defense using toxic inorganic ions: conceptual models of the defensive enhancement and joint effects hypotheses. Plant Sci. 195 88–95 1016/j.plantsci.2012.06.012[PubMed] [Cross Ref]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Refrigeration''' is an organisation in the UK that supports the refrigeration and air-conditioning industry.

==History==
The Institute was formed in 1899 as the Cold Storage and Ice Association, the first national society in the world for the refrigeration industry. The Institute's first president was [[Alan Egerton, 3rd Baron Egerton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser  |date=6 March 1902 |page=8 |title=Cold Storage at Knutsford. |publisher=[[British Newspaper Archive]] }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the IOR in 1944 when professional membership was introduced (when certain qualifications had to be obtained). A division of the organisation, the Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Institute, was launched in 2009.  In 2010 the Institute launched a short video explaining the opportunities for careers in the refrigeration industry under the title  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FwrkdvT3ts Careers in Cooling].  This uses interviews with a wide range of young people working in different aspects of refrigeration and air-conditioning to explain what a rewarding career it can be.  A [http://www.careersincooling.org webpage] was also set up to support the video.

==Structure==
The Institute of Refrigeration is governed by an Executive Council which comprises the President, the President-Elect, the Immediate Past-President, the Honorary Treasurer and six elected members.

The current council comprises

* President - Stephen Gill, FInstR
* Immediate Past-President -Prof Graeme Maidment, FInstR
* Hon Treasurer - Roger Borer, FInstR
* Elected Members - , John Austin-Davies, FInstR, David Bostock, FInstR, Kevin Glass, FInstR, Rob Lamb, FInstR, Mike Nankivell, FInstR, Chris Vallis, FInstR
The work of the Institute is carried out by committees, including

* Membership Committee - chair Dr Rob Lamb
* Technical Committee - chair Dr Andy Pearson
* Marketing Committee - chair Dr Jolyon Thompson
* Papers and Publications Committee - chair Colin Vines
* International Refrigeration Committee - chair Prof Judith Evans
* Service Engineers Section - chair Steve Benton
* Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Institute - chair John Ellis
* Sustainable Innovation in Refrigeration and Air Conditioning - chair Prof Graeme Maidment
* Annual Dinner Steering Committee - chair Paul Arrowsmith
* REAL Skills Europe steering group - chair James Bailey

===Branches===
It has branches covering:
* East Anglia
* [http://www.londonrefrigeration.org London Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Society]
* Northern
* [http://www.iorscotland.org.uk Scotland]

==Purpose==
The purpose of the Institute of Refrigeration is outlined in the Institute's constitution as follows:

a)	The general advancement of refrigeration in all its applications, in relation both to the perfection of its methods, and to the extension of its services to the community.

b)	To promote means for communication between members and their interchange of views.

c)	To encourage invention and research in all matters relating to the science and practice of refrigeration.

d)	To promote a sustainable approach to all aspects of refrigeration system design and operation

e)	To co-operate with educational institutions for the furtherance of education in the science and practice of refrigeration.

f)	To hold meetings of the Institute for reading and discussing papers dealing with refrigeration and allied subjects.

g)	To publish and distribute the proceedings or reports of the Institute.

h)	To do all other things, incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above objects or any of them.

The Institute hosts monthly meetings when a technical paper on a topical subject is presented.  The current programme of meetings can be found on the Institute's website [http://www.ior.org.uk IOR].  The Institute also hosts a black-tie dinner in London, usually on the third Thursday in February. In previous years the Institute dinner was held in the Great Room of the Grosvenor House Hotel, but declining numbers in recent years prompted a move in 2009 to the Grand Connaught Rooms in Covent Garden and then in 2012 to the Grange St Pauls Hotel.  The Institute publishes an annual set of Technical Proceedings on CD-rom as well as Safety Alerts, Guidance Notes and Good Practice Guides for Technicians.  It has also hosted International Scientific Conventions.

===Membership===
There are four main grades of membership; Associate, Technician, Member and Fellow.  Membership grade is based on relevant qualifications and experience in the industry and is determined by application to the membership committee.  The Institute is affiliated with the UK Engineering Council and has many overseas members.

[[Image:Rundstrickmaschine Zungennadeln.jpg|thumb|A modern industrial knitting machine in action]]

A '''knitting machine''' is a device used to create [[knitting|knitted]] [[fabric]]s in a semi or fully automated fashion.

There are numerous types of knitting machines, ranging from simple spool or board templates with no moving parts to highly complex mechanisms controlled by electronics. All, however, produce various types of knitted fabrics, usually either flat or tubular, and of varying degrees of complexity. Pattern [[stitch (textile arts)|stitch]]es can be selected by hand manipulation of the [[knitting needle|needles]], or with push-buttons and dials, mechanical [[punched card|punch card]]s, or electronic pattern reading devices and computers.

==Process==
[[File:Maschenbildung 1.jpg|thumb|Six stages in the knitting machine cycle]]
Early flat bed [[stocking frame]]s had low carbon steel bearded needles where the tips were reflexed and could be depressed onto a hollow closing the loop. The needles were supported on a ''needle bar'' that passed back and forth, to and from the operator. The beards were simultaneously depressed by a ''presser bar''.{{sfn|Earnshaw|1986|pp=12–13}}
#The needle bar goes forward- the open needles clear the web
#The weft thread is laid on the needles
#The weft thread falls loosely
#The needle bar draws back, the weft is pulled in the open needles
#The needle bar draws back, the presser bar drops, the needle loops close and the weft is drawn back through the web
#The needles open, a new row has been added to the web which drops under gravity

This basic process can still be recognised in all machines, but it has been refined as new technologies have become available.

==Types==
[[File:Stocking factory2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Advertisement for a late 19th-century hosiery firm that depicts its factory floor with workers using knitting machines.  Published 1886.]]
A few simple devices permit knitting without needles for toy or hobby purposes.  The simplest of these is [[spool knitting]], followed by knitting boards or knitting looms, which consist of two rows of pins mounted in two parallel rows approximately {{convert|0.5|in|cm}} apart. [[Yarn]] is wound around the pins; various patterns of winding produce different textured knitting. A needle or special tool is then used to transfer the loops of yarn from around the pins, either off the pins or to other pins, to produce the knitting. Knitting boards can produce complex designs. Other semi-mechanical knitting devices are available.

To produce larger and more complex knitted items, such as garments, domestic and industrial machines, with either flat or circular beds, producing rectangular or tubular fabrics, respectively, are needed.  Double bed machines have two flat beds facing each other, in order to produce [[wikt:purl|purl]] and plain rib fabrics plus a variety of multi patterns. [[Ribbing (knitting)|Ribbing]] attachments can be added to single bed machines to achieve a similar result.&lt;ref name="Gaugliumi (1990)"&gt; Hand Manipulated Stitches for Machine Knitters, Susan Gaugliumi (1990) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 20th century domestic/studio models typically use up to 200 [[latch-hook]] needles to hold the stitches in fine, standard, mid-gauge or bulky gauge needle. A carriage or cam box is passed across the bed of needles causing the needle movements required to produce each next stitch. By means of various selection methods, e.g. punch cards, particular needles can be caused to travel by alternate pathways through the cam box. Thus needles will knit or not, and the unknitted yarn portions will lie under ([[slip stitch]]) or over the needle or be held in the needle hook ([[tuck stitch]]). Needles can be placed in holding position to allow short row shaping.&lt;ref name="Gaugliumi (1990)"/&gt; In the most modern machines, punchcards have been replaced by computer control.
[[File:Jumberca.jpg|thumb|Modern Electronic Knitting Machines]]

Automatic patterning machines can knit two-colour [[Fair Isle (technique)|Fair Isle patterns]] automatically, and have machine stitch patterning features such as plating and knitweaving. Plating refers to knitting with two strands of yarn that are held in such a way that one is in front of the other. Plated effects can be particularly striking in a ribbed fabric. Knitweaving refers to a technique in which a separate piece of yarn, often heavier than the knitted fabric, is carried along and caught between stitches to produce an effect like weaving. With knitwoven fabric, the purl side (usually the wrong side) is the right side of the fabric. The fine and standard gauge models have the option of a lace carriage, where stitches can be transferred from one needle to the next. The yarn passes through a tensioning mechanism and down through the knit carriage, which feeds the yarn to the needles as they knit.

Domestic knitting machines use the ''weft'' knitting method which produces a fabric similar to [[hand knitting]]. Knitting proceeds more quickly than in hand knitting, where (usually two) straight [[Knitting needle|needles]] are held in the hand and each stitch is manipulated individually across the row. Knitting machines work an entire row of loops in a single movement.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Comparison to hand knitting==
The fabric produced using a knitting machine is of a more even texture than hand-knitted fabric, which is particularly noticeable on large areas of plain [[stockinette]] stitch, and can be an advantage.  Some stitch patterns (e.g., tuck stitches) are much easier to produce with a knitting machine.  Others (e.g. garter stitch) can also be produced with machine knitting but can take a little longer but still much faster than hand knitting.  The standard gauge 200-needle machine can knit the finest yarns up to a good sport-weight, while the heavier yarns knit better on a mid-gauge or bulky knitting machine.

Machine knitting saves a considerable amount of time but does require learning to operate the machines correctly.  Most if not all hand knitting patterns can be worked up on a machine, either identically or in a similar design. Hand knitting patterns are designed to "flip" the fabric on every row so that the knitter consistently uses the dominant hand. However, machine knitting is consistently knit with the fabric facing the same way. Flat Bed machines knit back and forth and Circular machines knit continuously in the round.

{{History of printing}}

'''Laser printing'''  is an [[electrostatic]] [[digital printing]] process. It produces high-quality text and graphics (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing a [[laser beam]] back and forth over a negatively [[Electric charge|charged]] cylinder called a "drum" to define a differentially charged image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laser%20printer|title=Laser Printer - Definition of laser printer by Merriam-Webster|publisher=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drum then selectively collects electrically charged powdered ink ([[toner]]), and transfers the image to paper, which is then heated in order to permanently fuse the text, imagery, or both. As with digital [[photocopier]]s, laser [[computer printer|printer]]s employ a [[Xerography|xerographic]] printing process. However, laser printing differs from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of the medium across the printer's photoreceptor. This enables laser printing to copy images more quickly than most photocopiers.

Invented at [[Xerox]] [[PARC (company)|PARC]] in the 1970s, laser printers were introduced for the office and then home markets in subsequent years by [[IBM]], [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], Xerox, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and many others. Over the decades, quality and speed have increased as price has fallen, and the once cutting-edge printing devices are now ubiquitous.

== History ==
[[File:Gary Starkweather.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gary Starkweather]] (seen here in 2009) invented the laser printer.]]
In the 1960s, the [[Xerox Corporation]] held a dominant position in the [[photocopier]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Jacob E. Goldman, Founder of Xerox Lab, Dies at 90

|quote=In the late 1960s, Xerox, then the dominant manufacturer of office copiers ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, [[Gary Starkweather]], who worked in Xerox's product development department, had the idea of using a laser beam to "draw" an image of what was to be copied directly onto the copier drum. After transferring to the recently formed [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (Xerox PARC) in 1971, Starkweather adapted a Xerox 7000 copier to create SLOT (Scanned Laser Output Terminal). In 1972, Starkweather worked with [[Butler Lampson]] and Ronald Rider to add a control system and character generator, resulting in a printer called EARS (Ethernet, Alto Research character generator, Scanned laser output terminal)—which later became the [[Xerox 9700]] laser printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gladwell| first=Malcolm| title=Creation Myth - Xerox PARC, Apple, and the truth about innovation|journal=The New Yorker| date=May 16, 2011| url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/05/16/110516fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all| accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology | author = Edwin D.

* '''1976''': The first commercial implementation of a laser printer was the [[IBM 3800]] in 1976. It was designed for [[data center]]s, where it replaced [[line printer]]s attached to [[mainframe computers]]. The IBM 3800 was used for high-volume printing on [[continuous stationery]], and achieved speeds of 215 [[pages per minute]] (ppm), at a resolution of 240 [[dots per inch]] (dpi). Over 8,000 of these printers were sold.&lt;ref name="Kasdorf2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=William E. Kasdorf|title=The Columbia Guide to Digital Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNIRkAqOzLUC&amp;pg=PA383|date=January 2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-12499-7|pages=383–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''1977''': The [[Xerox 9700]] was brought to market in 1977. Unlike the IBM 3800, the Xerox 9700 was not targeted to replace any particular existing printers; but, it did have limited support for the loading of [[Computer font|fonts]]. The Xerox 9700 excelled at printing high-value documents on cut-sheet paper with varying content (e.g. insurance policies).&lt;ref name="Kasdorf2003"/&gt;

Canon then began work on a much-improved print engine, the Canon CX, resulting in the LBP-CX printer. Having no experience in selling to computer users, Canon sought partnerships with three [[Silicon Valley]] companies: [[Diablo Data Systems]] (who rejected the offer), [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), and [[Apple Computer]].&lt;ref name="Malone2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Shawn Malone|title=Bill &amp; Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMSH_wzyDaEC&amp;pg=PA327|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-59184-152-4|pages=327–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1984''': The first laser printer intended for mass-market sales was the [[HP LaserJet]], released in 1984; it used the Canon CX engine, controlled by HP software. The LaserJet was quickly followed by printers from [[Brother Industries]], [[IBM]], and others. First-generation machines had large photosensitive drums, of circumference greater than the loaded paper's length. Once faster-recovery coatings were developed, the drums could touch the paper multiple times in a pass, and therefore be smaller in diameter.
* '''1985''': Apple introduced the [[LaserWriter]] (also based on the Canon CX engine),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.printerworks.com/Catalogs/CX-Catalog/CX-AppLW-LWPlus.html|title=TPW - CX Printers- Apple|work=printerworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but used the newly released [[PostScript]] page-description language. Up until this point, each manufacturer used its own proprietary page-description language, making the supporting software complex and expensive. PostScript allowed the use of text, fonts, graphics, images, and color largely independent of the printer's brand or resolution. [[PageMaker]], written by [[Aldus]] for the Macintosh and LaserWriter, was also released in 1985 and the combination became very popular for [[desktop publishing]].&lt;ref name="Allan2001"/&gt;{{rp|13/23}}&lt;ref name="Kasdorf2003"/&gt; {{rp|364}} Laser printers brought exceptionally fast and high-quality text printing in multiple fonts on a page, to the business and consumer markets.

[[File:Laser printer, 2015-01-23.ogg|thumb|The sound of a laser printer]]
A laser beam (typically, an [[aluminium gallium arsenide]] (AlGaAs) [[semiconductor laser]]) projects an image of the page to be printed onto an electrically charged, [[selenium]]-coated, rotating, cylindrical drum&lt;ref name="Nagabhushana2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Nagabhushana|title=Lasers and Optical Instrumentation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUzjTAr0U4MC&amp;pg=PA269|year=2010|publisher=I. K. International Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-93-80578-23-1|pages=269–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or, more commonly in subsequent versions, a drum called an [[organic compound|organic]] [[photoconductor]] made of [[N-vinylcarbazole]], an organic [[monomer]]). Photoconductivity allows the charged electrons to fall away from the areas exposed to light. Powdered ink ([[toner]]) particles are then electrostatically attracted to the charged areas of the drum that have not been laser-beamed. The drum then transfers the image onto paper (which is passed through the machine) by direct contact.  Finally the paper is passed onto a finisher, which uses intense heat to instantly fuse the toner/image onto the paper.

There are typically seven steps involved in the process:

=== Raster image processing ===
The document to be printed is encoded in a page description language such as PostScript, [[Printer Command Language]] (PCL), or [[Open XML Paper Specification]] (OpenXPS). The [[raster image processor]] converts the page description into a [[bitmap]] which is stored in the printer's raster memory. Each horizontal strip of dots across the page is known as a [[raster scan|raster]] line or [[scan line]].

Laser printing differs from other printing technologies in that each page is always rendered in a single continuous process without any pausing in the middle, while other technologies like [[inkjet printing|inkjet]] can pause every few lines. To avoid a [[buffer underrun]] (where the laser reaches a point on the page before it has the dots to draw there), a laser printer typically needs enough raster memory to hold the bitmap image of an entire page.

Memory requirements increase with the square of the [[dots per inch]], so 600 dpi requires a minimum of 4 megabytes for monochrome, and 16 megabytes for color (still at 600 dpi). For fully graphical output using a page description language, a minimum of 1 megabyte of memory is needed to store an entire monochrome letter/A4 sized page of dots at 300 dpi. At 300 dpi, there are 90,000 dots per square inch (300 dots per linear inch). A typical 8.5 × 11 sheet of paper has {{convert|0.25|in|mm|adj=on}} margins, reducing the printable area to {{convert|8.0|x|10.5|in|mm}}, or 84 square inches. 84 sq/in × 90,000 dots per sq/in = 7,560,000 dots. 1 [[megabyte]] = 1,048,576 bytes, or 8,388,608 bits, which is just large enough to hold the entire page at 300 dpi, leaving about 100 kilobytes to spare for use by the raster image processor.

In a color printer, each of the four [[CMYK]] toner layers is stored as a separate bitmap, and all four layers are typically preprocessed before printing begins, so a minimum of 4 megabytes is needed for a full-color letter-size page at 300 dpi.

During the 1980s, memory chips were still very expensive, which is why entry-level laser printers in that era always came with four-digit suggested retail prices in US dollars. Memory prices later plunged, and 1200 dpi printers have been widely available in the consumer market since 2008. 2400 dpi electrophotographic printing plate makers, essentially laser printers that print on plastic sheets, are also available.

=== Charging ===
[[File:Corona charging.svg|thumb|Applying a negative charge to the photosensitive drum]]
In older printers, a [[Corona discharge|corona wire]] positioned parallel to the drum or, in more recent printers, a primary charge roller, projects an [[electrostatic]] charge onto the photoreceptor (otherwise named the photo conductor unit), a revolving photosensitive drum or belt, which is capable of holding an electrostatic charge on its surface while it is in the dark.

An [[alternating current|AC]] bias voltage is applied to the primary charge roller to remove any residual charges left by previous images. The roller will also apply a [[direct current|DC]] bias on the drum surface to ensure a uniform negative potential.

Numerous patents{{Specify|date=January 2010}} describe the photosensitive drum coating as a [[silicon]] [[sandwich]] with a photocharging layer, a charge leakage barrier layer, as well as a surface layer. One version{{Specify|date=January 2010}} uses [[amorphous silicon]] containing [[hydrogen]] as the light receiving layer, [[Boron nitride]] as a charge leakage barrier layer, as well as a surface layer of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped silicon]], notably silicon with [[oxygen]] or [[nitrogen]] which at sufficient concentration resembles machining [[silicon nitride]].

=== Exposing ===
[[File:Laser printer-Writing.svg|thumb|Laser light selectively neutralizes the negative charge on the photoreceptive drum, to form an electrostatic image]]
[[File:Laser unit dell p1500 print.jpg|thumb|Laser unit from a Dell P1500. The white hexagon is the rotating scanner mirror.]]
A laser printer uses a laser because lasers are able to form highly focused, precise, and intense beams of light, especially over the short distances inside of a printer.  The laser is aimed at a rotating [[polygon]]al mirror which directs the light beam through a system of lenses and mirrors onto the photoreceptor drum, writing [[pixel]]s at rates up to sixty five million times per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=how Laser Process Technology animation (''sic'')|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDLM5fMFyA4|publisher=Lexmark|date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drum continues to rotate during the sweep, and the angle of sweep is canted very slightly to compensate for this motion. The stream of rasterized data held in the printer's memory rapidly turns the laser on and off as it sweeps.

The laser beam neutralizes (or reverses) the charge on the surface of the drum, leaving a [[static electricity|static electric]] negative image on the drum's surface which will repel the negatively charged toner particles. The areas on the drum which were struck by the laser, however, momentarily have no charge, and the toner being pressed against the drum by the toner-coated developer roll in the next step moves from the roll's rubber surface to the charged portions of the surface of the drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some non-laser printers ([[LED printer]]s) use an array of [[light-emitting diode]]s spanning the width of the page to generate an image, rather than using a laser. "Exposing" is also known as "writing" in some documentation.

=== Developing ===
As the drums rotate, [[toner]] is continuously applied in a 15-[[micron]]-thick layer to the ''developer roll''. The surface of the photoreceptor with the latent image is exposed to the toner-covered developer roll.

Toner consists of fine particles of dry plastic powder mixed with [[carbon black]] or coloring agents. The toner particles are given a negative charge inside the [[toner cartridge]], and as they emerge onto the developer drum they are electrostatically attracted to the photoreceptor's latent image (the areas on the surface of the drum which had been struck by the laser). Because negative charges repel each other, the negatively charged toner particles will not adhere to the drum where the negative charge (imparted previously by the charge roller) remains.

=== Transferring ===
A sheet of paper is then rolled under the photoreceptor drum, which has been coated with a pattern of toner particles in the exact places where the laser struck it moments before.  The toner particles have a very weak attraction to both the drum and the paper, but the bond to the drum is weaker and the particles transfer once again, this time from the drum's surface to the paper's surface. Some machines also use a positively charged "transfer roller" on the back side of the paper to help pull the negatively charged toner from the photoreceptor drum to the paper.

=== Fusing ===
[[File:Laser printer fusing.svg|thumb|left|Toner is fused onto paper with heat and pressure]]
The paper passes through rollers in the fuser assembly, where temperatures up to {{convert|427|C}} and pressure are used to permanently bond the toner to the paper. One roller is usually a hollow tube (heat roller) and the other is a rubber backed roller (pressure roller). A radiant heat lamp is suspended in the centre of the hollow tube, and its [[infrared]] energy uniformly heats the roller from the inside. For proper bonding of the toner, the fuser roller must be uniformly hot.

Some printers use a very thin flexible metal foil roller, so there is less [[thermal mass]] to be heated and the fuser can more quickly reach [[operating temperature]]. If paper moves through the fuser more slowly, there is more roller contact time for the toner to melt, and the fuser can operate at a lower temperature. Smaller, inexpensive laser printers typically print slowly, due to this energy-saving design, compared to large high speed printers where paper moves more rapidly through a high-temperature fuser with a very short contact time.

=== Cleaning and recharging===
[[File:Color Laser Printer Magnified.jpg|thumb|Magnification of color laser printer output, showing individual toner particles comprising 4 dots of an image with a bluish background]]
As the drum completes a revolution, it is exposed to an electrically neutral soft plastic blade which cleans any remaining toner from the photoreceptor drum and deposits it into a waste reservoir.  A charge roller then re-establishes a uniform negative charge on the surface of the now clean drum, readying it to be struck again by the laser.

=== Continuous printing ===
Once the raster image generation is complete, all steps of the printing process can occur one after the other in rapid succession. This permits the use of a very small and compact unit, where the photoreceptor is charged, rotates a few degrees and is scanned, rotates a few more degrees and is developed, and so forth. The entire process can be completed before the drum completes one revolution.

Different printers implement these steps in distinct ways. [[LED printer]]s use a linear array of [[light-emitting diode]]s to "write" the light on the drum. The toner is based on either [[wax]] or [[plastic]], so that when the paper passes through the fuser assembly, the particles of toner melt. The paper may or may not be oppositely charged. The fuser can be an infrared oven, a heated pressure roller, or (on some very fast, expensive printers) a [[xenon flash lamp]]. The warmup process that a laser printer goes through when power is initially applied to the printer consists mainly of heating the fuser element.

===Malfunctions===
The mechanism inside a laser printer is somewhat delicate and, once damaged, often impossible to repair.  The drum in particular is a critical component: it must not be left exposed to ambient light for more than a few hours, as light is what causes it to lose its charge and will eventually wear it out.  Anything that interferes with the operation of the laser such as a scrap of torn paper may prevent the laser from discharging some portion of the drum, causing those areas to appear as white vertical streaks.  If the neutral wiper blade fails to remove residual toner from the drum's surface, that toner may circulate on the drum a second time, causing smears on the printed page with each revolution.  If the charge roller becomes damaged or does not have enough power, it may fail to adequately negatively charge the surface of the drum, allowing the drum to pick up excessive toner on the next revolution from the developer roll and causing a repeated but fainter image from the previous revolution to appear down the page.

If the toner doctor blade does not ensure that a smooth, even layer of toner is applied to the developer roll, the resulting printout may have white streaks from this in places where the blade has scraped off too much toner. Alternatively if the blade allows too much toner to remain on the developer roll, the toner particles might come loose as the roll turns, precipitate onto the paper below, and become bonded to the paper during the fusing process. This will result in a general darkening of the printed page in broad vertical stripes with very soft edges.

If the fuser roller does not reach a high enough temperature or if the ambient humidity is too high, the toner will not fuse well to the paper and may flake off after printing.  If the fuser is too hot, the plastic component of the toner may smear, causing the printed text to look like it is wet or smudged, or may cause the melted toner to soak through the paper to the back side.

Different manufacturers claim that their toners are specifically developed for their printers, and that other toner formulations may not match the original specifications in terms of either tendency to accept a negative charge, to move to the discharged areas of the photoreceptor drum from the developer roll, to fuse appropriately to the paper, or to come off the drum cleanly in each revolution.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Performance ==
As with most electronic devices, the cost of laser printers has fallen markedly over the years. In 1984, the HP LaserJet sold for $3500,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/imagingprinting/0018/index.html | title = HP Virtual Museum: Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer, 1984 | publisher = Hp.com | date = | accessdate = 2010-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had trouble with even small, low resolution graphics, and weighed {{convert|32|kg|abbr=on}}. {{As of|2016}}, low-end monochrome laser printers can sell for less than $75. These printers tend to lack onboard processing and rely on the host computer to generate a [[raster image]], but outperform the 1984 LaserJet in nearly all situations.

Laser printer speed can vary widely, and depends on many factors, including the graphic intensity of the job being processed. The fastest models can print over 200 [[monochrome]] pages per minute (12,000 pages per hour). The fastest color laser printers can print over 100 pages per minute (6000 pages per hour). Very high-speed laser printers are used for mass mailings of personalized documents, such as credit card or utility bills, and are competing with [[lithography]] in some commercial applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papergear.com/xerox-news/facts-about-laser-printing.html |title=Facts about laser printing |publisher=Papergear.com |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124224933/http://www.papergear.com/xerox-news/facts-about-laser-printing.html |archivedate=November 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of this technology depends on a combination of factors, including the cost of paper, toner, drum replacement, as well as the replacement of other items such as the fuser assembly and transfer assembly. Often printers with soft plastic drums can have a very high cost of ownership that does not become apparent until the drum requires replacement.

[[Duplex printing]] (printing on both sides of the paper) can halve paper costs and reduce filing volumes. Formerly only available on high-end printers, duplexers are now common on mid-range office printers, though not all printers can accommodate a duplexing unit. Duplexing can also give a slower page-printing speed, because of the longer paper path.

In a commercial environment such as an [[office]], it is becoming increasingly common for businesses to use external [[software]] that increases the performance and efficiency of laser printers in the workplace. Software can be used to set rules dictating how employees interact with printers, such as setting limits on how many pages can be printed per day, limiting usage of color ink, and flagging jobs that appear to be wasteful. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://asl-group.co.uk/print-efficiency-workplace/|title=Print efficiency in the workplace: how to make your office more efficient|date=2017-05-11|work=ASL|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.managedprintservices.com/|title=What is Managed Print Services?|website=www.managedprintservices.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color laser printers ==
[[File:FujiXeroxDocuColourLaserPrint C1110B.PNG|thumb|[[Fuji Xerox]] color laser printer C1110B]]
Color laser printers use colored toner (dry ink), typically [[cyan]], [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[black]] ([[CMYK]]). While monochrome printers only use one laser scanner assembly, color printers often have two or more.

Color printing adds complexity to the printing process because very slight misalignments known as registration errors can occur between printing each color, causing unintended color fringing, blurring, or light/dark streaking along the edges of colored regions. To permit a high registration accuracy, some color laser printers use a large rotating belt called a "transfer belt". The transfer belt passes in front of all the toner cartridges and each of the toner layers are precisely applied to the belt. The combined layers are then applied to the paper in a uniform single step.

Color printers usually have a higher cost per page than monochrome printers (even if printing monochrome-only pages).

=== Business model comparison with inkjet printers ===
Manufacturers use a similar [[business model]] for both low-cost color laser printers and [[inkjet printers]]: the printers are sold cheaply while replacement toners and inks are relatively expensive. Color laser printers are much faster than inkjet printers and their running cost per page is usually slightly less. The print quality of color lasers is limited by their resolution (typically 600–1200 dpi) and their use of just four color toners. They often have trouble printing large areas of the same or subtle  gradations of color. Inkjet printers designed for printing photos can produce much higher quality color images.&lt;ref name="SteinmuellerGulbins2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Uwe Steinmueller|author2=Juergen Gulbins|title=Fine Art Printing for Photographers: Exhibition Quality Prints with Inkjet Printers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKj-3QdjCyMC&amp;pg=PT37|date=21 December 2010|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4571-0071-0|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An in depth comparison of inkjet and laser printers suggest that laser printers are the ideal choice for a high quality, volume printer, while inkjet printers tend to focus on large-format printers and household units.  Laser printers offer more precise edging and in-depth mono-chromatic color, but tend to cost more than a traditional inkjet printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Jordan|title=Inkjet vs Laser Printer|url=https://albertatoner.com/laser-vs-inkjet-printers/|website=Alberta Toner|publisher=Jordan Ale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-counterfeiting marks ===
[[File:Printer Steganography Illustration.png|thumb|upright|Small yellow dots on white paper, generated by a color laser printer, are nearly invisible. (Click to see higher-resolution image)]]
{{Main|Printer steganography}}
Many modern color laser printers mark printouts by a nearly invisible dot [[raster graphics|raster]], for the purpose of traceability. The dots are yellow and about {{convert|0.1|mm|abbr=on}} in size, with a raster of about {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}}. This is purportedly the result of a deal between the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] and printer manufacturers to help track [[counterfeiter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.eff.org/issues/printers | title = Electronic Frontier Foundation - Printer Tracking | publisher = Eff.org | date = | accessdate = 2017-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dots encode data such as printing date, time, and printer serial number in [[binary-coded decimal]] on every sheet of paper printed, which allows pieces of paper to be traced by the manufacturer to identify the place of purchase, and sometimes the buyer.

Digital rights advocacy groups such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] are concerned about this erosion of the privacy and anonymity of those who print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/02/eu-printer-tracking-dots-may-violate-human-rights | title = Electronic Frontier Foundation Threat to privacy | publisher = Eff.org | date = 2008-02-13 | accessdate = 2010-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Smart chips in toner cartridges ==
{{Main|Planned obsolescence}}
{{section move from | 1= Toner cartridge | date = November 2018}}
Similar to [[Inkjet printing#Business model|inkjet printers]], [[Toner cartridge|toner cartridges]] may contain smart [[Chip (computing)|chips]] that reduce the number of pages that can be printed with it (reducing the amount of usable ink or toner in the cartridge to sometimes only 50%&lt;ref&gt;RTBF documentary "L'obsolescence programmée" by Xavier Vanbuggenhout&lt;/ref&gt;), in an effort to increase sales of the toner cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/laser-toner-chip-72985.html|title=What Is a Laser Toner Chip?|work=Small Business - Chron.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being more expensive to the consumer, this technique also increases waste, and thus increases pressure on the environment. For these toner cartridges (as with inkjet cartridges), reset devices can be used to override the limitation set by the smart chip. Also, for some printers, online walk-throughs have been posted to demonstrate how to use up all the ink in the cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rumburg.org/printerhack/|title=Hacking the Samsung CLP-315 Laser Printer|work=Hello World!}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These chips offer no benefit to the end consumer—all laser printers originally used an optical mechanism to assess the amount of remaining toner in the cartridge rather than using a chip to electrically count the number of printed pages, and the chip's only function was as an alternate method to decrease the cartridge's usable life.

== Safety hazards, health risks, and precautions ==

=== Toner clean-up ===
[[Toner]] particles are formulated to have electrostatic properties and can develop static electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and vacuum hoses. Static discharge from charged toner particles can ignite combustible particles in a vacuum cleaner bag or create a small [[dust explosion]] if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner particles are so fine that they are poorly filtered by conventional household vacuum cleaner filter bags and blow through the motor or back into the room.

If toner spills into the laser printer, a special type of vacuum cleaner with an electrically conductive hose and a high-efficiency ([[HEPA]]) filter may be needed for effective cleaning. These specialized tools are called "ESD-safe" (Electrostatic Discharge-safe) or "toner vacuums".

=== Ozone hazards ===
As a normal part of the printing process, the high voltages inside the printer can produce a [[corona discharge]] that generates a small amount of ionized oxygen and nitrogen, which react to form [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen oxides]]. In larger commercial printers and copiers, an [[activated carbon]] filter in the air exhaust stream breaks down{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} these noxious gases to prevent pollution of the office environment.

However, some ozone escapes the filtering process in commercial printers, and ozone filters are not used at all in most smaller consumer printers. When a laser printer or copier is operated for a long period of time in a small, poorly ventilated space, these gases can build up to levels at which the odor of ozone or irritation may be noticed. A potential for creating a health hazard is theoretically possible in extreme cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Photocopiers and Laser Printers Health Hazards |url=http://www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk/Safety/general/photocopiers.pdf |date=2010-04-19 |website=www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Respiratory health risks ===
[[File:NIOSH Scientists Investigating Pollution From Office Equipment.webm|thumb|A video on research done on printer emissions]]
According to a 2012 study conducted in Queensland, Australia, some printers emit sub-[[micrometre]] particles which some suspect may be associated with respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Particle emission characteristics of office printers|vauthors=He C, Morawska L, Taplin L |year=2012 |pmid=17937279 |volume=41 |journal=Environ Sci Technol |pages=6039-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of 63 printers evaluated in the [[Queensland University of Technology]] study, 17 of the strongest emitters were made by HP and one by [[Toshiba]]. The machine population studied, however, was only those machines already in place in the building and was thus biased toward specific manufacturers. The authors noted that particle emissions varied substantially even among the same model of machine. According to Professor Morawska of the Queensland University of Technology, one printer emitted as many particles as a burning cigarette:&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title = Particle Emission Characteristics of Office Printers | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/printer-particles-as-bad-as-cigarettes/2007/07/31/1185647903291.html | work = The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 2007-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Study reveals the dangers of printer pollution | url = https://www.qut.edu.au/news/news?news-id=13495 | accessdate = 2017-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhle et al. (1991) reported that the responses to chronically inhaled copying toner, a plastic dust pigmented with carbon black, titanium dioxide and silica were also similar qualitatively to titanium dioxide and [[diesel exhaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 11.6 metals | url = http://www.epa.gov/nceawww1/pdfs/partmatt/April1996/0671ch11.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the Australian government agency [[Safe Work Australia]] reviewed existing research and concluded that "no epidemiology studies directly associating laser printer emissions with adverse health outcomes were located" and that several assessments conclude that "risk of direct toxicity and health effects from exposure to laser printer emissions is negligible". The review also observes that, because the emissions have been shown to be volatile or semi-volatile organic compounds, "it would be logical to expect possible health effects to be more related to the chemical nature of the aerosol rather than the physical character of the ‘particulate’ since such emissions are unlikely to be or remain as ‘particulates’ after they come into contact with respiratory tissue".&lt;ref name='SFA_2011-12'&gt;{{citation | first = Robert | last = Drew | title = Brief Review on Health Effects of Laser Printer Emissions Measured as Particles | publisher = [[Safe Work Australia]] | date = December 2011| id = | url = http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/about/publications/Documents/636/Brief%20Review%20Laser%20Printer%20Emissions.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170304205112/http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/SWA/about/Publications/Documents/636/Brief%20Review%20Laser%20Printer%20Emissions.pdf | archive-date = 2017-03-04 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air transport ban ===
After the [[2010 cargo plane bomb plot]], in which shipments of laser printers with explosive-filled toner cartridges were discovered on separate cargo airplanes, the US [[Transportation Security Administration]] prohibited pass-through passengers from carrying toner or ink cartridges weighing over {{convert|1|lb}} on inbound flights, in both carry-on and checked luggage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/international/uk-plane-bombs-explosions-were-possible-over-u-s-ncx-20101110 | title = UK: Plane Bombs Explosions Were Possible Over U.S | publisher = Fox News | date = | accessdate = 2010-11-17 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120329061859/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/international/uk-plane-bombs-explosions-were-possible-over-u-s-ncx-20101110 | archivedate = March 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcmag1"&gt;{{ cite news | last = Hoffman | first = Tony | url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372313,00.asp | title = U.S. Bans Large Printer Ink, Toner Cartridges on Inbound Flights | publisher = PC Mag | date = 2010-11-08| accessdate = 2017-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PC Magazine]]'' noted that the ban would not impact most  travelers, as the majority of cartridges do not exceed the proscribed weight.&lt;ref name="pcmag1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="904">In [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] [[aviation]], '''MULTICOM''' is a frequency allocation used as a [[CTAF|Common Traffic Advisory Frequency]] ([[CTAF]]) by aircraft near airports where no air traffic control is available.  Frequency allocations vary from region to region.

Despite the use of uppercase letters, MULTICOM is not an abbreviation or acronym.

In the United States, there is one MULTICOM frequency: 122.9&amp;nbsp;MHz. (See AIM table 4-1-2 or AIM table 4-1-1)  At uncontrolled airports without a UNICOM, pilots are to self-announce on the MULTICOM frequency.

In Australia, there is one MULTICOM frequency: 126.7&amp;nbsp;MHz.

In Brazil, there is one MULTICOM frequency: 123.45&amp;nbsp;MHz.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6913">A '''managed facilities-based voice network''' ('''MFVN''') is a physical network owned and operated by a voice service provider that delivers traditional telephone service via a loop start analog telephone interface. MFVNs are interconnected with the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) and provide dialtone to end users. Historically, this was provided by equipment at Bell company central offices, however today's MFVNs can include a combination of access network (last mile network of copper, coaxial cable, or fiber optics), customer premises equipment (CPE), network switches and routers, network management systems, voice call servers, and gateways to the larger PSTN.

MFVN providers include [[cable operators]] and [[telephone company|telephone companies]], but do not include Internet based providers such as [[Vonage]], [[Magic Jack]], and others that use the public internet to carry calls.

==Definition==
MFVN providers:
:(a) Manage and maintain their network to ensure [[wikt:end-to-end|end-to-end]] service quality and reliability from the service subscriber location to the PSTN or other MFVN peer network,
:(b) Provide a service that is functionally equivalent to traditional analog phone service with respect to dialing, [[dial plan]], call completion, carriage of voice signals and protocols, and loop voltage treatment,
:(c) Provide real-time transmission of voice signals that carry [[FAX]], data, [[Point of Sale]] (POS),  [[burglar alarm]] and [[fire alarm]] system formats unchanged,
:(d) Provide both professional installation and subscriber information on home wiring practices for residential installations if self-installation is available, which preserves primary line seizure for alarm system interconnection, and
:(e) Have major and minor [[disaster recovery]] plans to address both individual customer outages and widespread events such as tornados, ice storms or other occurrences of a catastrophic nature, which include specific network power restoration procedures equivalent to those of traditional landline telephone services.

==History==
The term MFVN was introduced in 2007 by various telephony user organizations and stakeholders who rely on telephone service to provide security and life safety services. The concern of these organizations and stakeholders was the reliability of new telephone technology and services. This new technology was based on packet voice technology, or the [[Voice over Internet Protocol]], which was not well understood. These organizations and stakeholders increasingly realized that they could no longer simply assume that phone service would be reliable enough, because it was increasingly being delivered in various ways, even by traditional providers. Clear performance requirements were needed to define when a phone line was suitable for security and life safety services.

This issue was not new, as analog copper based networks had been transitioning to [[digital telephony]] technology for 25 years (via fiber buildout by telephone companies), and to IP technology methods for the last 10 years (via broadband buildout by telco, cable, and competitive local exchange carriers). What was new was that copper based analog phone service was not even an option anymore in many areas, as it was being completely replaced by digital and IP based phone service.

Starting in the early part of the 2000s, IP based voice services began being offered by non-traditional providers such as cable television service providers and Internet voice service providers. The demand for these services grew due to competitive pricing and value added services not offered by the traditional telephone providers.  The use of these non-traditional telephone methods for security and life safety communications was not well understood, so use was discouraged and in some cases not allowed by local authorities. There was no distinction between voice services provided over the "best-effort" Internet and voice services provided over managed facilities. It became clear that only managed facilities based providers could assure reliability end to end. Only facilities based providers could monitor and maintain the expected quality of service (call quality, operation during power failure, wiring procedures that guaranteed pre-emption of existing calls for emergency calls, and local disaster recovery capabilities).

In 2007, the concept of the Managed Facilities-based Voice Network was introduced by non-traditional telephone providers as a way to think about the PSTN as a collection of managed networks, rather than as a single, monolithic entity.

The National Fire Protection Association incorporated this concept into the latest fire code, NFPA 72 2010, which is now the basis for determining whether a given phone line is an acceptable method for fire alarm signaling transmission from a protected premises to a supervising central monitoring station. Local authorities, such as fire inspectors, now no longer need to make these determinations on an individual case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States have begun to recognize and accept the use of MFVN. In Florida, it has been adopted by statute, whereby all qualified MFVNs are now allowed for fire alarm monitoring.

'''MasterClass''' is a San Francisco-based online education platform. Students can access tutorials and lectures pre-recorded by experts in various fields.

== Production ==
The concept was conceived by David Rogier and [[Aaron Rasmussen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/23/masterclass-raises-15-million-for-online-classes-taught-by-celebrities/|title=MasterClass Raises $15 Million For Online Classes Taught By Celebrities|last=Loizos|first=Connie|work=TechCrunch|access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
In addition to the video classes, class workbook and homework are also part of the course. In the case of actor [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s course, the "interactive assignments" involved the student acting with other students, either in person or over [[Skype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/dustin-hoffmans-online-acting-class-what-its-like-to-learn-from-the-master-10285753.html|title=Dustin Hoffman's online acting class: What it's like to learn from the master|date=May 29, 2015|work=The Independent|access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
The general consensus among critics is that while the classes do not teach technical skills to improve proficiency in the craft, they provide insight into the grueling nature of artistic pursuits and striving for perfection while inspiring a love of the craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christina-aguileras-masterclass-singing-review-892349|title=Christina Aguilera's MasterClass in Singing Through the Eyes of a Non-Singer|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-master-class-steve-martin-kevin-spacey-20170714-story.html|title=In this digital self-help age, just how effective are MasterClass's A-list celebrity workshops?|first=Amy|last=Kaufman|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://au.askmen.com/fine_living/wine_dine_archive/gordon-ramsay-masterclass-review.html|title=Can Gordon Ramsay's MasterClass Make You A Master Chef?

''[[The Verge]]'' noted that while the subscriptions last a lifetime, each course has little replay value, and so it is challenging to keep the student learning within the platform once they have viewed the video classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/15/15640354/masterclass-users-werner-herzog-gordon-ramsay|title=Who is MasterClass for? Talking to the people who take online classes with big-name celebs|work=The Verge|access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewopedia noted that while there are many educational tutorial platforms, this has a point of difference as having teachers that are worldwide recognised in their fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reviewopedia.com/masterclass-com-reviews|title=MasterClass.com Reviews - Legit or Scam?|publisher=Reviewopedia|access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' noted that the classes are not interactive, which is a symptom of online courses in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/04/david-mamet-masterclass-tutorial-playwriting-screenwriting-1202072976/|title=David Mamet Teaches Master Class On Writing For Stage &amp; Screen|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr|date=April 20, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kevin Spacey]]'s and [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s acting courses were removed in late 2017 after multiple sexual assault allegations had come out against both actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/kevin-spacey-masterclass-dropped-from-online-video-hub-1202198664/|title=Kevin Spacey MasterClass Dropped From Online Instructional Video Hub|last=Hayes|first=Dade|date=October 31, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=April 1, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploding demand for higher [[spectral efficiency]] in radio has spurred a renewed interest in analog real-time components and systems beyond conventional purely [[digital signal processing]] techniques. Although they are unrivaled at low microwave frequencies, due to their high flexibility, compact size, low cost and strong reliability, digital devices suffer of major issues, such as poor performance, high cost of A/D and D/A converters and excessive power consumption, at higher microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies. At such frequencies, analog devices and related real-time or [[analog signal processing]] (ASP) systems, which manipulate broadband signals in the time domain, may be far preferable, as they offer the benefits of lower complexity and higher speed, which may offer unprecedented solutions in the major areas of [[radio engineering]], including communications, but also radars, sensors, instrumentation and imaging. This new technology might be seen as microwave and millimeter-wave counterpart of ultra-fast optics signal processing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teich|first1=Bahaa E. A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8959">'''Mobile technology''' is the technology used for [[Cellular network|cellular communication]]. Mobile [[code-division multiple access]] (CDMA) technology has evolved rapidly over the past few years. Since the start of this millennium, a standard mobile device has gone from being no more than a simple two-way [[pager]] to being a [[mobile phone]], [[GPS navigation device]], an embedded [[web browser]] and [[instant messaging]] client, and a [[handheld gaming console]]. Many experts believe that the future of computer technology rests in [[mobile computing]] with [[wireless network]]ing. Mobile computing by way of tablet computers are becoming more popular. Tablets are available on the [[3G]] and [[4G]] networks.

==Mobile phone generations==
{{main|List of mobile phone generations}}

In the early 1980s, [[1G]] was introduced as voice-only communication via "brick phones".&lt;ref name="lifewire_phone_gens"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lifewire.com/1g-vs-2g-vs-2-5g-vs-3g-vs-4g-578681 |title=1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, &amp; 5G Explained |work=[[Lifewire]] |accessdate=2018-02-27 |date=2017-12-18 |author=Fendelman, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1991, the development of [[2G]] introduced [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) and [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] (MMS) capabilities, allowing picture messages to be sent and received between phones.&lt;ref name="lifewire_phone_gens"/&gt; In 1998, 3G was introduced to provide faster data-transmission speeds to support [[video calling]] and [[internet]] access. [[4G]] was released in 2008 to support more demanding services such as [[Mobile gaming|gaming services]], HD [[mobile TV]], [[Video conference|video conferencing]], and [[3D TV]].&lt;ref name="lifewire_phone_gens"/&gt; [[5G]] technology has been planned for the upcoming future.

===4G networking===
{{main|4G}}

4G is the current mainstream  cellular service offered to cell phone users, performance roughly 10 times faster than [[3G]] service.&lt;ref name="lifewire_4g"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-4g-wireless-577577 |work=[[Lifewire]] |accessdate=2018-02-27 |date=2017-12-18 |author=Cassavoy, Liane |title=What is 4G wireless?}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important features in the [[4G]] mobile networks is the domination of high-speed [[packet (information technology)|packet]] transmissions or burst traffic in the channels. The same codes used in the [[2G]]-[[3G]] networks are applied to 4G mobile or wireless networks, the detection of very short bursts will be a serious problem due to their very poor partial correlation properties. Recent study has indicated that traditional multilayer network architecture based on the [[Open Systems Interconnection]] (OSI) model may not be well suited for 4G mobile network, where transactions of short packets will be the major part of the traffic in the channels. As the packets from different mobiles carry completely different channel characteristics, the receiver should execute all necessary [[algorithm]]s, such as channel estimation, interactions with all upper layers and so on, within a very short period of time.

==Operating systems==
Many types of [[mobile operating system]]s (OS) are available for [[smartphone]]s, including [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry OS]], [[webOS]], [[iOS]], [[Symbian]], [[Windows Mobile]] Professional (touch screen), Windows Mobile Standard (non-touch screen), and [[Bada]]. The most popular are the Apple iPhone, and the newest: Android. Android, a mobile OS developed by [[Google]], is the first completely [[Open-source model|open-source]] mobile OS, meaning that it is free to any cell phone [[mobile network]].

Since 2008 customizable OSs allow the user to download [[Mobile app|apps]] like games, GPS, utilities, and other tools. Users can also create their own apps and publish them, e.g. to Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. The [[Palm Pre]] using [[webOS]] has functionality over the [[Internet]] and can support Internet-based programming languages such as [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), [[HTML]], and [[JavaScript]]. The [[Research In Motion]] (RIM) [[BlackBerry]] is a smartphone with a multimedia player and third-party software installation. The Windows Mobile Professional Smartphones ([[Pocket PC]] or Windows Mobile PDA) are like [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDA) and have [[touchscreen]] abilities. The Windows Mobile Standard does not have a touch screen but uses a [[trackball]], [[touchpad]], or rockers.

==Channel hogging and file sharing==
There will be a hit to file sharing, the normal web surfer would want to look at a new web page every minute or so at 100 kbs a page loads quickly.{{clarification needed|date=February 2018}} Because of the changes to the security of wireless networks users will be unable to do huge file transfers because service providers want to reduce channel use. [[AT&amp;T]] claimed that they would ban any of their users that they caught using [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) [[file sharing]] applications on their 3G network. It then became apparent that it would keep any of their users from using their iTunes programs. The users would then be forced to find a [[hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Wi-Fi hotspot]] to be able to download files. The limits of wireless networking will not be cured by 4G, as there are too many fundamental differences between wireless networking and other means of Internet access. If wireless vendors do not realize these differences and [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] limits, future wireless customers will find themselves disappointed and the market may suffer setbacks.

== Impacts on the modern family ==
Increasing mobile technology use has changed how the modern family interacts with one another through technology. With the rise of mobile devices, families are becoming increasingly "on-the-move",&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Katie Headrick|last2=Takeuchi|first2=Lori|last3=Stevens|first3=Reed|year=2017|title=Mapping the daily media round: novel methods for understanding families’ mobile technology use|journal=Learning, Media and Technology|pages=1–15|doi=10.1080/17439884.2017.1391286|issn=1743-9884}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spend less time in physical contact with one another. However, this trend does not mean that families are no longer interacting with each other, but rather have evolved into a more digitized variant. A study has shown that the modern family actually learns better with usage of mobile media,&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017" /&gt; and children are more willing to cooperate with their parents via a digital medium than a more direct approach. For example, family members can share information from articles or online videos via mobile devices and thus stay connected with one another during a busy day.

This trend is not without controversy, however. Many parents of [[elementary school]]-age children express concern and sometimes disapproval of heavy mobile technology use.&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017" /&gt; Parents may feel that excessive usage of such technologies distracts children from "un-plugged" bonding experiences, and many express safety concerns about children using mobile media. While parents may have many concerns are, they are not necessarily [[anti-technology]].&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017" /&gt; In fact, many parents express approval of mobile technology usage if their children can learn something from the session. for example, through art or music tutorials on [[YouTube]].

==Future of smartphones==
The next generation of smartphones will be context-aware, taking advantage of the growing availability of embedded physical sensors and data exchange abilities. One of the main features applying to this is that phones will start keeping track of users' personal data, and adapt to anticipate the information will need.  All-new applications will come out with the new phones, one of which is an X-ray device that reveals information about any location at which the phone is pointed. Companies are developing software to take advantage of more accurate location-sensing data. This has been described as making the phone a virtual mouse able to click the real world.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} An example would be pointing the phone's camera at a building while having the live feed open, and the phone will show text with the image of the building, and save its location for use in the future.

[[Omnitouch]] is a device via which apps can be viewed and used on a hand, arm, wall, desk, or any other everyday surface. The device uses a sensor touch interface, which enables the user to access all the functions through the use of the touch of a finger. It was developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. This device uses a projector and camera worn on the user's shoulder, with no controls other than the user's fingers.

'''Nocton Dairies''' is a British company which was formed by Devon farmer and cheese-maker Peter Willes and Lancashire milk producer David Barnes in order to construct an 8,100-cow [[dairy]] at [[Nocton]] Heath in [[Lincolnshire]],&lt;ref name="first application"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC20101112 &gt;{{cite news |title=Super dairy cow numbers to be cut |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=17 November 2010 |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-11747601}}&lt;/ref&gt; objectors to which claimed that it would have been the largest in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Juliette Jowit |coauthors= |title=A tale of two herds |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/13/milk-cows-dairy-farming |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=13 November 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning applications==
A [[planning application]] to [[North Kesteven District Council]] was made on 17 December 2009, but after concerns raised by the [[Environment Agency]], was withdrawn on 15 April 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/8616002.stm |title=Nocton 'super dairy' plans withdrawn |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; having already aroused considerable reaction in the media.&lt;ref name=Observer2010&gt;{{cite news |title=Opposition mounts to 'factory farm' plans that will house 8,100 cows |last=Wainwright |first=Martin |date=28 February 2010 |newspaper=The Observer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/28/factory-farm-plans-under-fire | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Times2010&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Battery’ dairy of 8,000 cows sparks protests |last=Ungoed-Thomas |first=Tom |date=28 February 2010 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7043926.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Indy2010&gt;{{cite news |title=Organic milk: Pint of the right stuff |last=Marren |first=Peter|date=11 May 2010 |newspaper=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/organic-milk-pint-of-the-right-stuff-1970459.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a premature report that the company had resubmitted its plans in August 2010,&lt;ref name=DT2010&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Britain's largest dairy farm planned |date=6 August 2010 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/7929832/Britains-largest-dairy-farm-planned.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a revised application was submitted on 17 November 2010 for a 3,770-cow dairy, the reduced size being intended to address some concerns.&lt;ref name="second application"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planningonline.n-kesteven.gov.uk/online-applications/simpleSearchResults.do;jsessionid=5FD306D6F21EC9AB0AB9176464004085?action=firstPage |title=10/1397/FUL |publisher=Planningonline.n-kesteven.gov.uk |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farmers Weekly 18 November 2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Nocton: Super-dairy plans resubmitted'
|last=Tasker |first=Johann |date=18 November 2010 |newspaper=Farmers Weekly |url=http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2010/11/18/124425/Nocton-Super-dairy-plans-resubmitted.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farmers Weekly article.  See http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2010/10/05/123839/Big-changes-to-Nocton-super-dairy-plan.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

With the new application lodged, public concern was raised again and opposition became increasingly vociferous.  On 16 February 2011, the company withdrew its second planning application and announced that it was abandoning its plans. A statement released by Nocton Dairies cited the objections of the Environment Agency as the sole reason and raised concerns that facts had been twisted on animal welfare matters.&lt;ref name="farmersguardian1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/business/nocton-dairies-scraps-super-dairy-plans/37242.article |title='Nocton Dairies scraps super dairy plans' |publisher=Farmers Guardian |date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It added: "The concept we have been proposing is a sound one. We challenge other farmers to pick up the baton and see where these concepts can take them."&lt;ref name="farmersguardian1"/&gt;  Just hours after Nocton Dairies' shock announcement, officers at North Kesteven District Council took the unusual step of making a public statement that they had been minded to recommend refusal of the application, on six grounds, namely:

#The failure of the applicant to fully assess alternative development sites which presented fewer environmental risks.
#The unacceptable and significant risk to groundwater quality, including the nearby public water supply.
#Significant uncertainties regarding the impacts and control of odour from the operation of the dairy, and associated land spreading, and its effects on residential amenity. 
#Insufficient detail regarding the frequency, volume and duration of operational noise, including from animals, and its effects on residential amenity. 
#Probable negative and adverse impacts to Bardney Limewoods Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a series of Local Wildlife Sites from increased ammonia and nitrogen deposition.
#Insufficient justification for the construction of on-site agricultural workers houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=151835441541216 | publisher=North Kesteven District Council |title='District Council Statement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, two separate but associated plans supporting the dairy were still active; a pipeline for the transportation of the digestate to be produced and a water storage reservoir intended for either water for dairy cows or for better management of water resources on the arable land, should the application for the dairy farm be refused.  Nocton Dairies did not withdraw either of these plans.  In February 2011 North Kesteven District Council refused planning permission for the pipeline&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planningonline.n-kesteven.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=LDVZ26LLX0000 |title='Construction of transfer pipeline' |publisher=North Kesteven District Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following month it refused permission for the reservoir, irrespective of its dual functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planningonline.n-kesteven.gov.uk/online-applications/simpleSearchResults.do?action=firstPage |title='Application for reservoir' |publisher=North Kesteven District Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to the applications==
Nocton Dairies' initial application aroused much opposition, including an [[Early Day Motion]] signed by 172 MPs in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 8 March 2010;&lt;ref name=CD&gt;{{cite news |title=Animal health campaigners welcome delay  |last=Davies |first=Caroline |date=13 April 2010 |newspaper=The Observer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/13/animal-welfare-nocton-dairies-farming | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was labelled by media reports at the time as a 'battery' farm for cows,&lt;ref name=Observer2010/&gt; despite reports of a growing number of similar (albeit smaller) indoor-based systems for dairy cows already successfully operating in the UK&lt;ref name=dairysite&gt;{{cite news |title=Dairy Farming Systems in Great Britain |url=http://www.thedairysite.com/articles/2549/dairy-farming-systems-in-great-britain |publisher=The Dairy Site |date=October 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nocton Dairies' explanations that their housing plans mirrored the open housing systems in which all British cows were already kept for the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=This Is Dairy Farming |url=http://www.thisisdairyfarming.com/dairy-farming-facts/browse-all-facts/-is-it-true-that-some-cows-never-go-outside-.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
After concerns were voiced over the potential for pollution of the water aquifer, smells, animal welfare, disease control, security, transport issues and property blight surrounding the site, some local people formed a campaign group named CAFFO.  A Number 10 e-petition, calling for a public inquiry into the development, was signed by 1,234 people in three weeks before the web site was closed for the duration of the 2010 UK election period.  However, a later Government response&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hmg.gov.uk/epetition-responses/petition-view.aspx?epref=giantdairy |title=Petition:Local residents reject ‘super dairy’ plan &amp;#124 |publisher=HM Government |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised the rigors of the planning process and current UK legislation ensuring high welfare standards.

Animal welfare charities and campaigners, and vegan and vegetarian groups also joined to support the case against the dairy.  A [[Facebook]] group set up by [[Vegetarians' International Voice for Animals|Viva!]] calling for a halt to construction attracted over 7,500 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo#!/pages/Oppose-the-UKs-biggest-factory-farm/310675121942 |title=Oppose the UK's biggest factory farm |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; WSPA (now called [[World Animal Protection|WAP]]) launched a campaign in September 2010 in anticipation of the resubmission of Nocton Dairies' proposal, featuring celebrities including [[Twiggy]], [[Andrew Sachs]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], [[Jenny Seagrove]] and a large number of soap stars, and attracted over 25,000 pledges from people around the world that 'factory milk from battery cows' would not be used in their cuppas. The results of an [[Ipsos MORI]] survey released at the launch showed that 61% of those questioned said they would never buy milk produced in large-scale indoor dairy sheds. [[Compassion in World Farming]]'s [http://www.ciwf.org.uk/cows_belong_in_fields/default.aspx 'Cows belong in fields'] campaign was launched late 2010, and the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]] also campaigned on the issue.  As well as this, a campaign was set up through site [[38 Degrees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.38degrees.org.uk/page/s/factoryfarm |title=Let's stop cow factory farms |publisher=38 Degrees |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; who submitted a petition of over 50,000 signatures to the district council in January 2011 on the basis that the farm was cruel and would put other farmers out of business.  38 Degrees also singled out neighbouring farmers who had been keen to use the 'digestate' (left from the cow manure after anaerobic digestion had taken place) on their arable land as a more sustainable and natural source of fertilisers and to replace essential organic matter.  These farmers pulled out of their agreements due to fear of reprisals after being named in adverts which urged the public to target them directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.38degrees.org.uk/2010/10/05/urgent-appeal-to-help-stop-cow-factory-farms/ |title=38 degrees Name and Shame campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a letter sent by the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter to ministers |url=http://www.fawc.org.uk/pdf/cows-welfare-letter.pdf |last=Wathes|first=Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; to government ministers stated that cow welfare need not be compromised in large dairy units, a message echoed by the [[RSPCA]], which, despite not permitting year-round housing for dairy cows within its Freedom Foods standards,&lt;ref name=dairysite/&gt; said it didn't believe 'big was necessarily bad' and in fact could offer welfare benefits if implemented correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Big dairies does not mean bad welfare, says RSPCA|date=12 August 2010 |newspaper=Farmers Guardian|url=http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/livestock/livestock-news/big-dairies-does-not-mean-bad-welfare-says-rspca/33670.article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other debates range around the potential for a large dairy such as this to improve food security&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Big Agriculture is the only option to stop food riots in Britain |date=12 September 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/12/food-riots-farming | location=London |first=Jay | last=Rayner}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opportunities to reduce the [[carbon footprint]] of milk production through better efficiency and the adoption of technology such as [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parish |first=Neil |title=Member of Parliament for Tiverton and Honiton - Blog|url=http://www.neilparish.co.uk/content/super-dairy |accessdate= 31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the Government has published its Foresight report on Food and Farming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foresight: Future of Food and Farming |url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight/our-work/projects/current-projects/global-food-and-farming-futures/reports-and-publications  |publisher=HM Government |first=Professor Sir John |last=Beddington}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the dairy's developers have asserted that their plans would help address the report's conclusions that farming needs to produce more food using fewer resources while tackling climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nocton super dairy farmer hits out at critics |publisher=Farmers Weekly |url=http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2011/02/01/125299/Nocton-super-dairy-farmer-hits-out-at-critics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the consultation period, the Council reported as many as 14,000 objections had been lodged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/13/super-dairy-cows-lincolnshire-objections |title='Super-dairy' with 3,770 cows triggers 14,000 planning objections |publisher=The Observer | location=London |first=Tracy |last=McVeigh |date=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[PETA]] claiming responsibility for at least 6,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.peta.org.uk/2011/02/victory-for-cows-nocton-dairies-withdraws-cow-prison-application-in-lincolnshire/ |title=Victory for Cows! |publisher=PETA}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIWF 5,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/beef_and_dairy_farming/cows_belong_in_fields_campaign_success.aspx |title=Compassion celebrates |publisher=CIWF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other animal and vegan groups claiming many more; this was substantiated by an extensive social media campaign orchestrated by these groups against the proposal.  However, this was countered by growing dairy industry support for the Nocton proposal, illustrated in submissions from the [[National Farmers Union (England and Wales)]] (NFU), the [[Country Land and Business Association]], and Dairy UK, representing processors and farmers.&lt;ref name="second application"/&gt;  Dairy UK warned: "Reject Nocton and UK dairy will suffer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/articles.aspx?page=articles&amp;ID=215900 |title=Reject Nocton and UK dairy will suffer |publisher=The Grocer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supermarket views==
Supermarket chains [[Sainsbury's|S]]ainsbury, [[Tesco]], [[Waitrose]] and [[Marks &amp; Spencer]], as well as online food retailer [[Ocado]], all indicated they did not intend to buy milk from 'super-dairies', while [[Morrisons]] and [[Wal-Mart|American-owned]] [[Asda]] seemed to support them. According to ''[[The Independent]]'', Morrisons said they would consider buying from the farm, while Asda said they refused to answer such a "hypothetical" question.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/supermarkets-turn-noses-up-at-megadairy-milk-2137056.html "Supermarkets turn noses up at megadairy milk", The Independent 18 November 2010] Retrieved 2011-02-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In letters to a Parliamentary group in March 2010, Tesco and Sainsbury stressed their commitment to animal welfare and stated that they had no plans to buy milk from Nocton.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; In another letter, Waitrose's managing director Mark Price stated, "a dairy farm of the size proposed would not fit with the Waitrose way of doing business, and I have to say that I am anxious that it represents the first step along the way towards a highly-industrialised, US approach to farming".&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;  On 17 November 2010, Marks &amp; Spencer declared, "M&amp;S does not buy milk from 'super-dairy' farms and we are committed to our current pool of dedicated dairy farms."&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;  [[Jason Gissing]], co-founder of Ocado, said in a letter published on the Ocado web site in December 2010, "Rest assured, Ocado will not be milking it with Nocton.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocado.com/theocadoway/talking%20ocado/2010/nocton.html "Don’t milk it" - letter from Jason Gissing, Ocado] Retrieved 2011-02-15&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Morrisons again stressed its willingness to consider buying the farm's milk at the NFU conference in February 2011, saying the supermarket was open-minded about purchasing milk from Nocton-style dairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfuonline.com/News/NFU-11---Demanding-action-on-dairy/ |title=Demanding action on dairy at NFU 11 |publisher=NFU Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; And despite the stand taken by these other supermarkets, their words were called into question when it was revealed in an industry newsletter that a number of them already willingly take supply from larger indoor-based UK dairy farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= 
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45053136/Dairy%20Industry%20Newsletter.pdf |title=Dairy Industry Newsletter |date=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to withdrawal of plans==
The consortium of opponents of the dairy - Vegetarian International Voice for Animals, The Soil Association, CPRE, Compassion in World Farming, Friends of the Earth, WSPA and local campaign group CAFFO - expressed delight that the plans had been withdrawn when the news was announced on 16 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/beef_and_dairy_farming/cows_belong_in_fields_campaign_success.aspx |title=Cows belong in fields |publisher=CIWF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.viva.org.uk/mediareleases/display.php?articlepid=242 |title=Nocton withdraws plans |publisher=Viva!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wspa.org.uk/latestnews/2011/Nocton_Dairies_withdraw_plans.aspx |title=Nocton Dairies withdraws plans |publisher=WSPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caffo.co.uk/ |title=CAFFO statement }}&lt;/ref&gt; WSPA UK's director Suzi Morris said: "This is fantastic news and greatly welcomed. This is a victory for consumers, dairy farmers and of course the cows within it and we can't forget the Lincolnshire community which has had a narrow escape."

The industry reaction was somewhat different. The news coincided with the end of the NFU conference where NFU president Peter Kendall, Agriculture Minister Jim Paice and food critic Jay Rayner were among those defending the concept of large scale farming.&lt;ref name="NFU conference"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2011/02/17/125550/Nocton-debate-shows-need-for-investment-in-PR.htm |title=Nocton debate shows the need for investment in PR |publisher=Farmers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news was greeted with concern that the dairy industry would find it hard to meet future challenges if it could not evolve and develop.  Mansel Raymond, chair of the NFU's dairy board, said: "It is disappointing that the application has been withdrawn. Any planned investment in the dairy industry is a positive step. Nocton was an imaginative and innovative proposal, and I firmly believe that there remains a place in Britain for this type of investment if we are to meet the growing demand for food.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfuonline.com/News/BREAKING-NEWS---Nocton-plans-withdrawn/ |title=Nocton plans withdrawn |publisher=NFU Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers also expressed its disappointment at the withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-12491580 |title=Farmers say Lincolnshire 'super dairy' reflects future |publisher=BBC | date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Cattle Veterinary Association, which leads the industry in managing the health and welfare of dairy cows in the UK, also took the steps of dismissing claims that Nocton Dairies would have been a "cow prison", saying its developers demonstrated a commitment to good welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vetsonline.com/actualites/detail/36673-revues-1/vets-defend-mega-dairy-s-commitment-to-animal-welfare.html |title=Vets defend mega dairy's commitment to animal welfare |publisher=VetsOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
Whether or not this or indeed any so called 'super-dairy' is ever built, this controversy is likely to have a lasting impact on Britain's future dairy policy. Supporters claim large scale farming offers opportunities to meet food security and climate change challenges of the future. Research by opponents counter this hypothesis with an argument that the economics of the system are unsustainable in a report titled: '[http://www.fcrn.org.uk/research-library/milk/productionconsumption/wspa-briefing-weighing-economics-dairy-farms Weighing the economics of dairy farms]'; however, the figures used in this report have also been heavily criticised by the industry's leading providers of economics data DairyCo, part of the [[Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board]], saying that the different systems are not being compared on a like for like basis and are ‘astonishingly naïve’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.farmersguardian.com/news/dragons-den-star-attacks-mega-dairy-business-model/41520.article |first=Alistair |last=Driver |title= Dragon's Den star attacks mega-dairy business model}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are concerns that any similar proposal, if successful, would set a precedent for the development of large-scale farming systems more commonly associated with the US where such units are known as [[CAFO]]s&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; - although with the definition of a dairy CAFO being over 750 cows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |title=Definition of a CAFO |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sector_table.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.dairyco.org.uk DairyCo], the dairy industry's levy and advisory body, says there are already at least 12 such farms operating successfully and without issues - as proven by the lack of media interest in these farms - in England.

Comments made by at the 2011 NFU conference by food critic Jay Rayner during a panel discussion entitled ‘Is modern agriculture palatable?’&lt;ref name="NFU conference"/&gt; pointed to the industry being at fault. Mr Rayner told farmers that perception that the public would disapprove of such a development had been given fuel by a lack of positive PR.  “The industry has to look at how it communicates to the media, not just to the industry and government. Basically it needs to work out a way to kill those page three [[Daily Mail]] stories which misrepresent what agriculture is.  There is a failure of imagination. You need to employ some PR people to communicate the realities of agricultural production in the 21st century.”

Either way, the fact that many farmers are prosecuted by the Environment Agency for pollution or waste offences as they struggle to adhere to constantly tightening regulation, demonstrates that environmental legislation is crucial to the protection of the land where any such development is placed.  Following the withdrawal and refusal of Nocton Dairies' plans, one of the directors, Peter Willes, had to pay over £23,000 when he accepted responsibility for three environmental offences, two of which related to pollution of water courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=This is Devon |url=http://www.thisisnorthdevon.co.uk/news/Farmer-fined-163-19-500-waste-law-breaches/article-3442270-detail/article.html |title=A NORTH Devon farmer behind plans to build a super dairy has been ordered to pay £23,205 for flouting environmental regulations |publisher=This is North Devon |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr Willes' previous environmental offences were also outlined in a widely criticised Daily Mail article on mega dairies, which drew unrepresentative comparisons against US practices long banned in the UK and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Boggan |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1292011/The-truth-mega-farms-Chemical-fumes-distressed-animals-poisoned-locals.html |title=The truth about mega-farms: Chemical fumes, distressed animals, poisoned locals &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All involved also learned that social media plays an important part in 21st century campaigning as while they had no direct impact on the withdrawal of the application, thousands of supporters were gained via the range of sites named earlier.  However, it also became clear that as well as factual information, a number of myths and untruths were also being propagated over social media - one led to a petition with 15,000 signatures being withdrawn as it falsely claimed hormones and tail docking would form part of the plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totalfrance.com/france/forum/viewtopic.php?p=893053&amp;sid=1e8073942004037aa996c7cee811d50c |title='Statement from Care2 about withdrawal of petition in grounds of inaccuracies}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting concerns that support generated in this way might contain little substance.  Campaigners also learned that developers will both take issue with  their efforts and will threaten legal action where they feel inaccuracies have been portrayed;  Nocton Dairies' referral of local group CAFFO to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45053136/Complaints%20lodged%20against%20CAFFO%20leaflet%20under%20CAP%20Code.pdf |title=A complaint raised against CAFFO leaflet}}&lt;/ref&gt; was 'informally resolved'&lt;ref&gt;See http://nocton.blogspot.com/2011/02/nocton-breathes-sigh-of-relief.html&lt;/ref&gt; when CAFFO notified the ASA that the leaflet had already been distributed and there were no immediate plans to publish another, stopping the investigation in its tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45053136/2011-02-22%20ASA.pdf |title=Letter from ASA regarding complaint against CAFFO}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a later date, another large scale farm developer, Midland Pig Producers, threatened legal action against the Soil Association because of unsubstantiated and libellous allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/18/soil-association-libel-pig-farm |title=Soil Association given libel warning after objection to huge pig farm |publisher=The Guardian |date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phaistos 01.jpg|thumb|260px|Palace complex at [[Phaistos]]]]
The '''Phaistos Disc''' (also spelled '''Phaistos Disk''', '''Phaestos Disc''') is a disk of fired [[clay]] from the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palace of [[Phaistos]] on the island of [[Crete]], possibly dating to the middle or late Minoan [[Bronze Age]] ([[second millennium B.C.]]). The disk is about 15&amp;nbsp;cm (5.9&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter and covered on both sides with a spiral of stamped symbols. Its purpose and meaning, and even its original geographical place of manufacture, remain disputed, making it one of the most famous mysteries of [[archaeology]]. This unique object is now on display at the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum|archaeological museum]] of [[Heraklion]].

The disc was discovered in 1908 by the Italian archaeologist [[Luigi Pernier]] in the Minoan palace-site of Phaistos, and features 241 tokens, comprising 45 distinct signs, which were apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic "seals" into a disc of soft clay, in a clockwise sequence spiraling toward the center of the disk.

The Phaistos Disc captured the imagination of amateur and professional archaeologists, and many [[Phaistos Disc decipherment claims|attempts have been made to decipher the code]] behind the disc's signs. While it is not clear that it is a script, most attempted [[decipherment]]s assume that it is; most additionally assume a [[syllabary]], others an [[alphabet]] or [[logography]]. Attempts at decipherment are generally thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs are found, as it is generally agreed that there is not enough context available for a meaningful analysis.

Although the Phaistos Disc is generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists, a few scholars believe that the disc is a [[forgery]] or a [[hoax]].

==Discovery==
[[Image:Table Ph1.png|thumb|250px|Tablet PH-1]]The Phaistos Disc was discovered in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palace-site of [[Phaistos]], near [[Hagia Triada]], on the south coast of [[Crete]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes C.Michael Hogan, ''Phaistos fieldnotes'', The Modern Antiquarian, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the disc was found in the basement of room 8 in building 101 of a group of buildings to the northeast of the main palace. This grouping of four rooms also served as a formal entry into the palace complex.  [[Italy|Italian]] archaeologist [[Luigi Pernier]] recovered the intact "dish", about {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and uniformly slightly more than {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=off}} in thickness, on 3 July 1908 during his [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of the first Minoan palace.

It was found in the main cell of an underground "temple depository". These basement cells, only accessible from above, were neatly covered with a layer of fine [[plaster]]. Their content was poor in precious artifacts, but rich in black earth and ashes, mixed with burnt [[bovine]] bones. In the northern part of the main cell, in the same black layer, a few inches south-east of the disc and about {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=off}} above the floor, [[Linear A]] tablet ''PH 1'' was also found. The site apparently collapsed as a result of an [[earthquake]], possibly linked with the  [[Minoan eruption|eruption]] of the [[Santorini]] volcano that affected large parts of the [[Mediterranean region]] during the mid second millennium B.C.

=== Authenticity ===
The Phaistos Disc is generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell-Dunn|first=Graham|title=Who Were the Minoans?|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2006|pages=207|isbn=978-1-4259-2007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of authenticity is based on the excavation records by Luigi Pernier. This assumption is supported by the later discovery of the [[Arkalochori Axe]] with similar but not identical glyphs.&lt;ref name="Timm2004" /&gt;

The possibility that the disc is a 1908 [[archaeological forgery|forgery]] or hoax has been raised by two scholars.&lt;ref name="Robinson:2008"&gt;Robinson:2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg2008A"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Eisenberg | first = Jerome M. | title = The Phaistos Disk: one hundred year old hoax? | journal = Minerva | issue = July/August | year = 2008 | pages = 9–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg2008B"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Eisenberg | first = Jerome M. | title = Phaistos Disk: A 100-Year-Old Hoax?

A gold signet ring from Knossos (the Mavro Spilio ring), found in 1926, contains a Linear A inscription developed in a field defined by a spiral—similar to the Phaistos Disc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/objekt/159123 Siegel CMS II,3 038]&lt;/ref&gt; A sealing found in 1955 shows the only known parallel to sign 21 (𐇤, the “comb”) of the Phaistos disc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/5996948/Notes_on_the_Authenticity_of_the_Phaistos_Disk  Notes on the Autheticity of the Phaistos disc]&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered as evidence that the Phaistos Disc is a genuine [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] artifact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/fakultaeten/philosophie/zaw/cms/monthlySeal/monthlySealOlder.html Seal of the month - 2013] Heidelberg University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
Yves Duhoux (1977) dates the disc to between 1850 B.C. and 1600 B.C. ([[Minoan chronology|MMIII]]) on the basis of Luigi Pernier's report, which says that the Disc was in a  Middle Minoan undisturbed context. Jeppesen (1963) dates it to after 1400 ([[Minoan chronology|LMII-III]]). Doubting the viability of Pernier's report, [[Louis Godart]] (1990) resigns himself to admitting that archaeologically, the disc may be dated to anywhere in Middle or Late Minoan times (MMI-LMIII, a period spanning most of the [[second millennium B.C.]]). J. Best suggests a date in the first half of the fourteenth century B.C. (LMIIIA) based on his dating of tablet PH 1.&lt;ref name="AchterbergSociety2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Winfried Achterberg|author2=Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society|title=The Phaistos disc: a Luwian letter to Nestor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9hmAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society|isbn=978-90-72067-11-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typography ==
The inscription was apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic "seals" into the soft clay, in a clockwise sequence spiraling toward the center of the disk. It was then fired at high temperature. The unique character of the Phaistos Disc stems from the fact that the entire text was inscribed in this way, reproducing a body of text with reusable characters.

The German typesetter and linguist [[Herbert Brekle]], in his article "The typographic principle" in the ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'', argues that the Phaistos Disc is an early document of [[movable type]] printing, since it meets the essential criterion of [[typographic]] printing, that of type identity:

{{quote|An early clear incidence for the realization of the typographic principle is the notorious Phaistos Disc (ca. 1800–1600 B.C.). If the disc is, as assumed, a textual representation, we are really dealing with a "printed" text, which fulfills all definitional criteria of the typographic principle. The spiral sequencing of the graphematical units, the fact that they are impressed in a clay disc (blind printing!) and not imprinted are merely possible technological variants of textual representation. The decisive factor is that the material "types" are proven to be repeatedly instantiated on the clay disc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]] (1997): [http://www.typeforum.de/news_332.htm "Das typographische Prinzip. Versuch einer Begriffsklärung"], ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'', Vol. 72, pp. 58–63 (60f.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a medieval example for the same technique he goes on to cite the [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]] (1997): [http://www.typeforum.de/news_332.htm "Das typographische Prinzip. Versuch einer Begriffsklärung"], ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'', Vol. 72, pp. 58–63 (62f.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]] (2005): ''Die Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift von 1119. Eine paläographisch-typographische Untersuchung'' ([http://www.typeforum.de/news_308.htm brief summary]), Scriptorium Verlag für Kultur und Wissenschaft, Regensburg, {{ISBN|3-937527-06-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work on decipherment, Benjamin Schwartz also refers to the Phaistos Disc as "the first movable type".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Phaistos disk|first=Benjamin|last=Schwartz|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=18|issue= 2 |year=1959|pages=105–112 (107)|doi=10.1086/371517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his popular science book ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] describes the disc as an example of a technological advancement that did not become widespread because it was made at the wrong time in history, and contrasts this with [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Society|first=Jared|last=Diamond|chapter=13: Necessity's Mother: The evolution of technology|isbn=978-0-393-03891-0|title-link=Guns, Germs, and Steel|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signs===
There are  242 tokens on the disc, comprising 45 distinct signs. Many of these 45 signs represent easily identifiable everyday things. In addition to these, there is a small diagonal line that occurs underneath the final sign in a group a total of 18 times. The disc shows traces of [[#Corrections|corrections]] made by the scribe in several places. The 45 symbols were numbered by [[Arthur Evans]] from 01 to 45, and this numbering has become the conventional reference used by most researchers. Some symbols have been compared with [[Linear A]] characters by Nahm,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Vergleich von Zeichen des Diskos von Phaistos mit Linear A|first=Werner|last=Nahm|journal=Kadmos|issue= Vol. 14, No. 2.

Other scholars (J. Best, S. Davis) have pointed to similar resemblances with the [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s, or with [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s  (A. Cuny). In the table below, the character "names" as given by Louis Godart (1995) are given in upper case; where other description or elaboration applies, they are given in lower case.

The nine ''[[hapax]]es'', i.e. occurring just once, are 04 (A5), 05 (B3), 11 (A13), 15 (B8), 17 (A24), 30 (B27), 42 (B9), 43 (B4), 44 (A7). Of the eight twice-occurring symbols, four (03, 21, 28, 41) occur on side A only, three (09, 16, 20) on side B only, and only one (14) on both sides.

===Oblique stroke signs===
There are a number of signs marked with an oblique stroke; the strokes are not imprinted but carved by hand, and are attached to the first or last sign of a "word", depending on the direction of reading chosen. Their meaning is a matter of discussion. One hypothesis, supported by Evans, Duhoux, Ohlenroth and others, is that they were used to subdivide the text into paragraphs, but alternative meanings have been offered by other scholars.

===Directionality===
Evans, at one point, published an assertion that the disc had been written, and should be read, from the center out; because it would have been easiest to place the inscription first and then size the disc to fit the text. There is general agreement that he was wrong, and Evans himself later changed his mind: the inscription was made, and should be read, from the outside in toward the centre. The centres of the spirals are not in the centre of the disc, and some of the symbols near the centre are crowded, as though the maker was cramped for space. One pair of symbols are set top-to-bottom, so it is hard to tell what order they should be in. Except in the cramped section, when there are overstrikes, the inner symbol overlies the outer symbol. Jean Faucounau has proposed a reconstruction of the scribe's movements, which would also require an inward direction; Yves Duhoux says that any outward reading may be discarded. Despite this consensus, there are still a few such attempted decipherments (See [[Phaistos Disc decipherment claims]]).

In addition to the question of the directionality of the text on the disc itself, different viewpoints are held as to how the Phaistos Disc characters should be displayed when transcribed into text. The disc itself probably has right-to-left directionality, if reading proceeds from the outside to the centre; this means that the reading direction is into the faces of the people and animals, as it is in Egyptian and Anatolian. Phaistos Disc characters are shown with left-to-right directionality in this article, with the glyphs mirrored compared to their orientation on the disc; which is also the typical practice for edited Egyptian and Anatolian hieroglyphic text.

===Inscription text===
The following is a rendering of the Phaistos Disc inscription in [[Unicode]] characters (the text will only be displayed correctly if a font that supports Unicode Phaistos Disc characters, such as [[Noto Sans|Noto Sans Symbols]] or [[Everson Mono]] is installed):

[[File:PhaistosDiskTranscribed.png|center|frame|Width200|Image of the transcription for those who do not have the appropriate fonts installed.]]

[[File:Discos Phaitos Umzeichnung.png|thumb|Fields numbering by Louis Godart]]
There are 61 "words", 31 on side A and 30 on side B (numbered A1 to A31 and B1 to B30, outside to inside), here read outside-to-inside (putting the "plumed head" signs word-initially and the strokes word-finally). The shortest words are two symbols in length, the longest seven symbols. The strokes are here transcribed as diagonal strokes (/). The transcription begins at the vertical line of five dots, circling the rim of the disc once, clockwise (13 words on A, 12 words on B) before spiralling toward the center (18 more words on each side). There is one word-final effaced sign at A8, which Godart (1995:101) notes as resembling sign 3 or 20; or less probably 8 or 44. Evans considered side A as the front side, but technical arguments have since been forwarded favouring side B as the front side.

The signs in the transcription below appear in left-to-right orientation, and the reader may read into the faces of the human and animal figures (as one reads Egyptian and Anatolian hieroglyphs):

The "plumed head" (02) only ever occurs word-initially, in 13 instances followed by the "shield" (12, which in some instances also occurs word-finally). Six words occur twice each:
The three-word sequence 02-27-25-10-23-18 28-01/ 02-12-31-26/ occurs twice (A14-16, A20-22). 02-12-31-26/ recurs for a third time (A19). Four more words occur twice each, 02-12-27-27-35-37-21 (A17, A29), 10-03-38 (A28, A31), 22-29-36-07-08/ (B21, B26) and 29-45-07/ (A3, B20).

===Corrections===
As noted [[#Signs|above]], corrections have been made. Signs have been erased and over-printed by other signs.

Godart (1995:99-107) describes these corrections, by word.
They occur in the following words: A1 (signs 02-12-13-01), A4 (29-29-34) together with A5 (02-12-04), A8 (12), A10 (02-41-19?-35), A12 (12), A16 (12-31-26?), A17 (second 27?), A29 (second 27?), B1 (12-22), B3 (37?), B4 (22-25 imprinted over the same), B10 (07?-24?-40?), B13 (beside 29?). Question marks indicate uncertainty about that particular sign being the result of a correction.

Also, the borders of word B28 has been widened to make room for sign 02. See Duhoux (1977:34-35) and Godart (1995:107).

=== Rotations ===

The two signs 27 (Hide) in word A29 are rotated 180 degrees compared with all other occurrences of this sign: "head down" versus "head up". This rotation might be motivated by lack of space in A29; see Duhoux (1977), p.24 (section 6A-8). 

The rotations of the signs 29 (Cat) and 31 (Eagle) have no lack of space. Defining the sign 29 in words B19, B20 and B21 as "head to the right", we have: head down in B29; head to the left in A3 and B15; head up in B18 and B26; head in between up and left in B13; head in between right and down in A4 (twice). The direction of the head of sign 31 is as follows: to the right in A16, up in A9 and A25, and to the left in A22.

The sign 02 (Plumed head) in word A29 is 90 degrees rotated to the right compared with all other occurrences of this sign. This might well be due to lack of space; the word is crowded and messy, with the sign 12 (Shield) pushed aside. 

The two occurrences of sign 28 (Bull's leg) are not rotated compared with each other. Rather, the way this sign is shown in the literature (including Unicode), with the foot down, is rotated compared with the sign on the disc, with the foot up. 

If one assumes the rotations are completely randomly distributed, then the probability that they end up in only two (or three) signs is very small. This suggests that these rotations might be deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;ten Cate, Arie, "A statistical analysis of the rotated signs of the Phaistos Disc", ''Pioneer Journal of Theoretical and Applied Statistics'', Vol 6, Issue 2, pp.81-88 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signs in adjacent windings===
There are several occurrences on side A where the same sign is at two places near each other in adjacent windings of the spiral. For example, consider the Plumed Head (sign 02) in word A1 and the Plumed Head in word A14. Three patterns of such occurrences have been identified. A computer analysis of one of them (involving most of the Plumed Head signs on side A) has been performed with the conclusion that the probability of this pattern being coincidental is small. The existence of the two other patterns further decreases the probability of coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;ten Cate, Arie, "Patterns on an ancient artifact: a coincidence?", ''Statistica Neerlandica'', Vol 65, pp.116–124 (2011) {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9574.2010.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several occurrences are caused by a [[#Corrections|correction]]. Also, the orientation of the signs seems to be relevant: the two Hides (sign 27) in word A29 are upside down, with the "heads" pointing to the Hide sign in the adjacent winding in word A23.

If this is indeed not coincidental then the inscription is not a one-dimensional text. Of course this does not give us a decipherment; rather it narrows down the potential decipherments.

==Decipherment attempts==
{{further|Phaistos Disc decipherment claims}}

A great deal of speculation developed around the disc during the twentieth century. The Phaistos Disc captured the imagination of amateur archeologists. Many attempts have been made to [[decipherment|decipher]] the code behind the disc's signs. Historically, almost anything has been proposed, including prayers, a narrative or an adventure story, a "[[psaltery|psalterion]]", a call to arms, a [[board game]], and a geometric [[theorem]]. Some of the more fanciful interpretations of its meaning are classic examples of [[pseudoarchaeology]].

Most linguistic interpretations assume a [[syllabary]], based on the proportion of 45 symbols in a text of 241 tokens typical for that type of script; some assume a syllabary with interspersed [[logographic]] symbols, a property of every known syllabary of the [[Ancient Near East]] ([[Linear B]] as well as [[cuneiform]] and [[hieroglyph]]ic writing). There are, however, also alphabetic and purely logographical interpretations.

While enthusiasts still believe the mystery can be solved, scholarly attempts at [[decipherment]] are thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs turn up somewhere, as it is generally thought that there is not enough context available for meaningful analysis. Any decipherment without external confirmation, such as successful comparison to other inscriptions, is unlikely to be accepted as conclusive.

===Origin of the script===

====Cretan or foreign origin?====
There are a few main theories about the origin of the signs. For the first few decades after its discovery most scholars argued strongly against the local origin of the artifact.  Evans (1909:24f.) wrote  that
{{quote|
when one comes to compare the figures in detail with those of the [[Minoan hieroglyphic signary]], very great discrepancy is observable... Out of the forty-five separate signs on the Phaistos Disk, no more than ten more or less resemble Cretan hieroglyphic forms... The human figures in their outline and costume are non-Minoan... The representation of the ship also differs from all similar designs that occur either among the hieroglyphic or the linear documents of Crete.
}}

Glotz (1925:381) claimed that the clay was not from Crete. Ipsen (1929:15) concluded that the Disc was certainly from somewhere on the Aegean. Because of its differences from Linear A or B, Ipsen found it tempting to assume, like Evans, a non-Cretan origin for the Disc. He observes, however, that since Linear A was a common Aegean script such an assumption will not resolve the problem of multiplicity.

The [[Arkalochori Axe]] and other finds have made Cretan origin more popular: female images with pendulous breasts have also been found at Malia and Phaistos. (Godart 1995:125).  Duhoux asserts the Cretan ''provenance'' of the disc; in his review of current research, Trauth (1990:154) concludes that "Crete as [the] source of the Disc can no longer be called into question." [[W. Andrew Robinson|Andrew Robinson]] (2008), in a review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', wrote "Most scholars today, including Duhoux, think it a plausible working hypothesis that the disc was made in Crete."

====Original invention or derivation?====
Ipsen (1929:11) also speaks  against an entirely independent origin of the scripts, arguing that its inventors did not leap from no knowledge of writing to a syllabic script with these elegant signs. He goes on to cite [[Anatolian hieroglyph|Hieroglyphic Luwian]] as a "perfect parallel" (Ipsen 1929:17) of an original script inspired under the direct influence of other scripts (its symbol values inspired by [[cuneiform]], its shapes by [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s)

Schwartz (1956:108) asserts a genetic relationship between the Phaistos Disc script and the Cretan linear scripts.

Among the known scripts, there are three main candidates for being related to the Disc's script, all of them partly syllabic, partly logographic: [[Linear A]], [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s and Egyptian hieroglyphs. More remote possibilities are comparison with the [[Phoenician abjad]] or the [[Byblos syllabary]].

====Linear A====
Some signs are close enough to both [[Linear A]] and [[Linear B]] that they may have the same phonetic values, as [[Image:Phaistos glyph 12.svg|40x30px|12]] 12 = ''qe'', [[Image:Phaistos glyph 43.svg|40x30px|43]] 43 = ''ta''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or [[Image:Phaistos glyph 31.svg|40x30px|31]] 31 = ''ku''. But this opinion is not shared by all specialists of the Aegean Scripts.
A recent systematic comparison with Linear A is that of  Torsten Timm, 2004.&lt;ref name="Timm2004" /&gt;  Based on the [[Linear A]] character distribution patterns collected by Facchetti&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Statistical data and morphematic elements in Linear A|first=Giulio M.|last=Facchetti|journal=Kadmos|issue= Vol. 38, No. 2. (1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timm concludes that the language of the Disc inscription is the same as the language of Linear A. Timm identifies 20 of the 45 characters with Linear signs, assigning Linear B phonetic values to 16.

====Anatolian hieroglyphs====
Achterberg et al. (2004) present a systematic comparison with [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s, resulting in a full decipherment claim (see below). In particular, they consider the stroke symbol cognate to the [[Luwian language|Luwian]] ''r(a/i)'' symbol, but assign it the value ''-ti''. The stroke on A3 is identified as the personal name determinative. [[Image:Phaistos glyph 01.svg|40x30px|01]] 01 is compared to the [[logogram]] ''SARU'', a walking man or walking legs in Luwian. [[Image:Phaistos glyph 02.svg|40x30px|02]] 02 is compared to word-initial ''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', a head with a crown in Luwian. The "bow" [[Image:Phaistos glyph 11.svg|40x30px|11]] 11 is identified as the logogram ''sol suus'', the [[winged sun]] known from Luwian royal seals. The "shield" [[Image:Phaistos glyph 12.svg|40x30px|12]] 12 is compared to the near identical Luwian logogram ''TURPI'' "bread" and assigned the value ''tu''.  [[Image:Phaistos glyph 39.svg|40x30px|39]] 39 they read as the "[[thunderbolt]]", logogram of [[Tarhunt]], in Luwian a W-shaped hieroglyph.

=== List of decipherment claims ===
{{main|Phaistos Disc decipherment claims}}

The decipherment claims listed are categorized into linguistic decipherments, identifying the language of the inscription, and non-linguistic decipherments. A purely [[logogram|logographical]] reading is not linguistic in the strict sense: while it may reveal the meaning of the inscription, it will not allow for the identification of the underlying language.

==Unicode==

{{Main|Phaistos Disc (Unicode block)}}

A set of 46 Phaistos Disc characters, comprising 45 signs and one combining oblique stroke, have been encoded in [[Unicode]] since April 2008 (Unicode version 5.1). They are assigned to the range 101D0–101FF in Plane 1 (the [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]]). Phaistos Disc characters were encoded with strong left-to-right [[Bidirectional algorithm|directionality]], and so in code charts and text (such as elsewhere on this page) the glyphs are mirrored from the way they appear on the disc itself.

{{Unicode chart Phaistos Disc}}

==Modern use==
Side A of the Phaistos disc is used as the logo of [[Foundation for Research &amp; Technology – Hellas|FORTH]], one of the largest research centers in Greece.

[[Recreational vehicle]]s (RVs) are designed to be [[Self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]], making an on-board [[refrigerator]] a highly desirable appliance. However, RVs are subject to conditions that make the design of their refrigerators quite challenging. The main issues are vibrations, accelerations, the energy required to drive the refrigeration process, and the often off-level attitude of the vehicle, especially while in transit. An [[absorption refrigerator|absorption-type refrigerator]] overcomes most of these design challenges, and therefore has been popular in RVs since the 1950s.

== Overview ==

Following is a [[block diagram]] and a simplified drawing of a typical absorption type RV Fridge. The block diagram is a simplification of the fridge cycle which shows the key components combined with the [[fluid flow]] within the [[Hydraulic circuit|circuit]]. The simplified fluids schematic more closely resembles the actual refrigeration cycle so that the reader can draw a connection between the components on their fridge and what is occurring within the cooling unit pressure vessel.

== Brief history of absorption refrigeration ==

The first absorption refrigeration system was patented by [[Ferdinand Carré|Ferdinand Carre]] in 1859. This refrigeration system had mechanical pumps and throttling valves which change the pressures in the refrigeration cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Cengel, Yunus A. ''Thermodynamics an Engineering Approach''. McGraw-Hill, 2002, p. 590&lt;/ref&gt;

The RV Fridge is considered a single pressure absorption refrigeration (SPAR) system because the entire system is at the same total pressure.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''ASHRAE Handbook - Refrigeration (SI)'', American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc., 2014, p.18.9&lt;/ref&gt; Because there are no pumps or compressors it is easy to sustain these fridges in an RV as long as [[propane]] (LP gas) is available. The SPAR was patented by [[Baltzar von Platen (inventor)|Baltzar von Platen]] and [[Carl Munters]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US1669269|title=Patent US1669269 - Refrigeration|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Block diagram&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; ==

[[File:RV Fridge Block Diagram.png|thumb|right|RV Fridge Block Diagram]]

The block diagram shows the flow of fluids (Q&lt;small&gt;x&lt;/small&gt;) along with the flow direction arrows. Also, the heat input ([[endothermic process]]) and heat rejection ([[exothermic process]]) for the respective components has been identified.
The fluid flow is as follows:

'''Q&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt;:''' The yellow line is the holding tank mixture of liquid water, ammonia, and a rust inhibitor.

'''Q&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;:''' The blue line is the weak solution. The weak solution preferably consists of only water and the rust inhibitor as a result of the distillation process.

'''Q&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;:''' The pink line is pure ammonia gas ([[anhydrous ammonia]]). The heat input in the fired boiler causes the liquid ammonia within '''Q&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt;''' to boil (go through a [[Phase transition|phase change]]).

'''Q&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt;:''' The green line is ammonia liquid. The condenser cools the ammonia gas '''(Q&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;)''' to produce the [[working fluid]] which removes the heat from the refrigerated compartment.

'''Q&lt;small&gt;5&lt;/small&gt;:''' The pink line is once again ammonia gas. The ammonia gas is produced by evaporation of the ammonia liquid '''(Q&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt;)''' within the evaporator. The evaporation of the liquid ammonia is due to [[Dalton's law]] of partial pressures&lt;ref&gt;Cengel, Yunus A. ''Thermodynamics an Engineering Approach''. McGraw-Hill, 2002, p. 636&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[pressure vessel]] which is commonly referenced as a cooling unit in the RV industry has all of the air evacuated and a hydrogen charge of approximately 350psi (~2.4MPa).

'''Q&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;''' + '''Q&lt;small&gt;5&lt;/small&gt;''' → '''Q&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt;:''' In the absorber coil the circuit is completed. '''Q&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt;''' is reconstituted due to the fact that ammonia has an affinity for water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/ammonia_refrigeration/ammonia/|title=Ammonia Refrigeration - Properties of Ammonia|work=osha.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weak solution '''(Q&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;)''' absorbs the ammonia gas thereby returning the ammonia to a liquid state to reenter the boiler and start the process over.

The RV fridge simplified fluids schematic more closely resembles the actual cooling unit. (The same color schemes have been used for the fluid flow as the block diagram.)

=== Boiler ===

[[File:Rv-fridge-boiler.png|thumb|RV Fridge Boiler]]

The RV Fridge boiler is the heart of the refrigeration process. It performs two main tasks; one is to separate the ammonia from the water using the process of [[distillation]]. The second task that the boiler performs is to pump the fluids which maintains the flow Qx within the cooling unit. The RV Fridge boiler is considered a watertube type boiler which has the advantage of low weight and a high circulation rate which is desirable for mobile applications.&lt;ref&gt;''Section VII ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code'', The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2010, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Process flow ====

'''Q&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt;''' Holding Tank to Percolator Tube

Starting at the holding tank the fluids Q1 are delivered to the boiler through the inner annular tube. Heat is applied and the ammonia changes phase from liquid to gas. The ammonia gas rises up the percolator tube (pump tube) forcing the remaining water that has been depleted of ammonia up the pump tube at the same time.

'''Q&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;''' Weak Solution

At the top of the percolator tube the water Q2 drops down by the force of gravity into the outer annular tube. This water passes by the heat input to further deplete the flow Q2 of any remaining ammonia. In addition, the flow Q2 also provides preheating (regenerator&lt;ref&gt;Cengel, Yunus A. ''Thermodynamics an Engineering Approach''. McGraw-Hill, 2002, p. 588&lt;/ref&gt;) for flow Q1 as Q1 moves from the holding tank to the boiler.
     
'''Q&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;''' Generation of Refrigerant

From the top of the percolator tube the anhydrous ammonia rises due to its density. The entire boiler assembly and percolator tube are also called a generator because the refrigerant is generated here.

==== Boiler ammonia accumulator ====

The ammonia accumulator is a bell shaped chamber. The bottom of the chamber is open to the boiler and the top is closed with the percolator tube passing through. The accumulator fills with ammonia gas from the bottom, this in turn forces out any liquids from within the accumulator. The ammonia accumulator serves two important startup functions as follows:

One is to provide an area where the ammonia bubbles can gather when the heat source is started. This allows large bubbles to rise up the percolator tube upon startup rather than allowing the ammonia in the boiler to rise up the percolator tube without pumping the resulting liquid water.

The second function is to provide an ammonia reserve. When the heat is turned off at the boiler, as the boiler cools the same effect can occur as described above. If the ammonia is depleted from the boiler upon cool down the process cannot restart upon startup. Thus, when the boiler temperature lowers, the ammonia gas trapped in the accumulator will return into solution reconstituting Q1 for a strong ammonia solution in the boiler for an easy startup.

==== Controls ====

The controls for the RV Fridge center around controlling the boiler heat source. For the most part the control is binary. If refrigeration is called for, one of the boiler heat sources is turned on. When the refrigerated space is cool enough the boiler heat source is turned off.

RV Fridge controls have not changed much in function since 1923 when [[Kelvinator]] introduced the first refrigerator control with automatic temperature control. Please see next section Boiler Safety for modern RV Fridge controls.

=== Boiler safety ===

==== Pressure ====

One issue that is faced by any heated pressure vessel is how to prevent catastrophic rupture.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;''Section VII ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code'', The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2010, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; This is why the typical RV Fridge has a pressure relief device which is commonly called a PRV. The RV Fridge PRV is very limited because it is a [[fusible plug]]. It is reported that the fusible plug will only vent the pressure vessel in the event of a fire.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Unfortunately the fusible plug does not prevent a majority of fridge safety issues. The RV fridge fusible plug is a retroactive device which responds to a major failure mode that results in a fire.

==== Limit thermal stress ====

One of the first major RV Fridge control changes occurred when the Absorption Refrigeration Protective RV (ARPrv&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arprv.com/norcold-fridge-problem.html|title=Why RV Fridge Fail|work=ARPrv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Controller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US8056360|title=Patent US8056360 - Absorption refrigeration protective controller|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was invented. The ARPrv control principle of operation is based on the same physics that result in a constant temperature for the [[Boiling point|boiling of water]]. The ARP Control simply measures the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]] of ammonia. The ARP detects when Q2 is not flowing by the rise in temperature due to ammonia not being returned to the boiler.&lt;ref&gt;''ASHRAE Handbook - Refrigeration (SI)'', American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc., 2014, p.18.8&lt;/ref&gt; When ammonia does not return to the boiler, the sodium chromate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Inorganic_Chemistry/Descriptive_Chemistry/d-Block_Elements/Group_06%3A_Transition_Metals/Chemistry_of_Chromium|title=Chemistry of Chromium|work=ucdavis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; is destroyed by excess heat. Once the sodium chromate is destroyed, [[intergranular corrosion]], which leads to stress corrosion cracking,&lt;ref&gt;''Section VII ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code'', The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2010, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; will eventually result in a cooling unit rupture. This discovery has solved most of the operator error issues such as off-level operation of the fridge. The ARPrv controller is a proactive automatic boiler control&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; that limits both thermal stress on the boiler and stress on the working fluids. In addition, by limiting the temperature at the boiler, the [[Gas laws|pressure in the cooling unit]] is controlled which in turn increases safety and longevity of the RV Fridge.

=== Condenser ===

[[File:Rv-fridge-condinsers.png|thumb|RV Fridge Condenser]]

The RV Fridge [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] cools and liquefies the pure ammonia gas Q3 that rises up from the boiler. The liquefied ammonia Q4 flows from the condenser to the evaporator where the actual refrigeration takes place.

==== Failure modes ====

The RV Fridge condenser needs two requirements meet in order for it to sustain the refrigeration cycle. The first is the condenser environment temperature must remain below the condensation temperature of ammonia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/liquids/condevap.html|title=Condensation and Evaporation|work=purdue.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the system pressure, otherwise the ammonia will remain in a gaseous state. Therefore, the condenser requires proper air circulation. The second factor for proper operation is that the condenser is level such that the liquid ammonia will flow into the evaporator. When the fridge is operated off-level the ammonia will pool in the condenser. This pooling results in Q4 flow cessation and thus stops the refrigeration process because the ammonia cannot enter the evaporator for cooling of the fridge. In addition, the pooling of ammonia in the condenser prevents the ammonia from returning to the boiler causing complete cessation of the boiler function. When the boiler function stops overheating of the boiler follows.

=== Evaporator ===

[[File:Rv-fridge-evaporator.png|thumb|RV Fridge Evaporator]]
The RV Fridge [[evaporator]] is where cooling of the refrigerated cabinet occurs. Basically all refrigeration process use evaporation for cooling. In the absorption type RV Fridge liquid ammonia Q4 enters from the condenser and flows down the evaporator. Within the evaporator the liquid ammonia comes in contact with the assistant gas which is generally [[hydrogen]]. Due to [[Dalton's law]] of partial pressures the liquid ammonia Q4 evaporates thereby absorbing heat from within the refrigerated space. Because the ammonia gas Q5 is heavier than the assistant gas, the ammonia gas flows out the bottom of the evaporator.

==== Construction ====

The evaporator is located within the foam cabinet in an RV Fridge. When one looks into either the freezer or refrigerated cabinets the back wall will generally have an aluminum plate which may have fins for increasing surface area for the absorption of heat from the refrigerated space. Depending on the type and construction of the RV Fridge, as a rule of thumb, the top half of the evaporator is in thermal contact with the freezer section and the lower half is in contact with the refrigerated section of the cabinet.

==== Failure modes ====

Due to the construction of the evaporator there are two failure modes. The first is not a failure of the evaporator but rather the consequence of a failing boiler assembly. As an example, if the fridge has been operated off-level and the boiler is allowed to overheat, the volume of liquid ammonia Q4 is reduced. The reduced ammonia flow Q4 results in the ammonia evaporating before reaching the lower half of the evaporator.  As a result, the freezer may be very cold, while the refrigerated space is too warm to prevent [[food spoilage]].

The second mode of failure is due to the evaporator not being sealed properly. Often screws hold the evaporator into place from the inside of the refrigerator. If the screw heads are not sealed, water from inside the cabinet will flow by [[capillary action]] into the sealed evaporator space within the foam. Also, the back side of the evaporator has to be sealed so that ambient air cannot infiltrate the sealed evaporator space. When ambient air is allowed to come into contact with the evaporator, condensation results. The result for both of these issues is that water is trapped against the steel evaporator tubing, forming a [[galvanic cell]] which will rust a hole in the evaporator, resulting in premature fridge failure.

=== Absorber ===

[[File:Rv-fridge-absorber.png|thumb|RV Fridge Absorber]]
The absorber or absorber coils is where the fluids are recombined to complete the refrigeration fluids circuit.  The ammonia gas Q5 drops down from the evaporator into the absorber where it comes into contact with the weak solution Q2 (water) flowing into the top of the absorber coils. When the ammonia vapor Q5 comes into contact with the weak solution liquid Q2, the weak solution absorbs the ammonia gas due to ammonias affinity for water. The absorption of ammonia gas into the water solution is an exothermic process, thus heat needs to be rejected from the absorber coils. The absorber coil is where the heat from within the fridge is rejected into the surroundings.

==== Failure modes ====

The absorber itself is not subject to failure due to corrosion or stress when constructed properly. The absorber can be reduced in capacity if the temperatures get too high in the cooling unit compartment. High temperatures slow down the rate at which ammonia gas is reabsorbed (Solubility of Ammonia in Water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/gases-solubility-water-d_1148.html|title=Solubility of Gases in Water|work=engineeringtoolbox.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), therefore this can result in poor cooling within the refrigerated space. A simple test to see if the ammonia is completing the circuit is to feel the absorber coil. If the absorber coil does not heat within an hour of turning on the fridge it is possible that the ammonia is not being produced by the boiler or the ammonia is not completing the circuit. Besides the fridge cabinet temperature, knowing the RV Fridge boiler temperature and the absorber temperature gives one the information to know if the RV Fridge is functioning properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3141">'''Reindustrialization''' is the economic, social, and political process of organizing national resources for the purpose of re-establishing industries. The process proceeds as a result of a need to reinvigorate national economies.

==Interpretations==
[[China]], [[India]] and [[South-East Asia]] were industrial powerhouse for major parts of human history.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Maddison (2006), "The World Economy", OECD Publishing,{{ISBN|92-64-02261-9}} Page 263&lt;/ref&gt; These countries and regions suffered great loss of industrial production due to [[colonialism|colonization]] during 18th-20th centuries. After many decades of their independence, these countries have started reindustrializing themselves. In last three decades, share of these countries in global industrial output has increased manifold.
 
In context of declining share of [[OECD]] in world GDP and [[outsourcing]] of manufacturing and services, reindustrialization is considered as a contrasts to [[deindustrialization]], the process under which [[industry]], especially [[manufacturing]], is relocated outside of a country's borders, and seeks to reverse that trend.

No longer the preserve of [[BRIC]]s or [[South-East Asia]]n countries, the notion of reindustrialization seems to be making inroads in the political discourse of [[populist]] policy makers in the developed economies of Western Europe and North America: notably France and the United States - where the rise of [[Trumponomics]] may potentially challenge some of the free trade tenets of the neoliberal "[[Washington Consensus]]".

==Causes of Reindustrialization==
# In context of Asian economies, reindustrialization is a natural process of economic growth in which former industrial powerhouses [[China]], [[India]] and [[South-East Asia]] are re-establishing their economies
# Advocates of reindustrialization believe that manufacturing and other industrial jobs are more socially and economically desirable than jobs in the [[service sector]] or [[finance]].
# [[Military]] or [[national security]] concerns motivate reindustrialization policies, reflecting a desire for [[self-sufficiency]] and fear for [[trade route]]s and [[supply line]]s in times of conflict. 
# Reindustrialization policies may reflect concerns over the [[balance of trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/2011/en_GB/wp2011-057/ | title=Manufacturing Productivity, Deindustrialization, and Reindustrialization | publisher=United Nations University | accessdate=February 2, 2012 | author=Tregenna, Fiona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2010/11/30/how-to-get-positioned-for-americas-reindustrializa.aspx | title=How to Get Positioned for America's Reindustrialization | publisher=The Motley Fool | date=Nov 30, 2010 | accessdate=February 2, 2012 | author=Shute, Toby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Risk Analysis''' (SRA) is a [[learned society]] providing an open forum for anyone interested in [[risk analysis]]. It seeks to: provide an avenue for individuals (from different disciplines from various corners of the globe) to discuss ideas and information as well as methodologies for analyzing risk and solving related issues and problems; promote understanding and encourage collaboration among professionals and organisations relevant to analyzing risk and providing solutions; disseminate and promote risk (methods) knowledge and their applications in research and education; and serve its members in developing and furthering their careers in risk analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org/about-society-risk-analysis| title= About the Society for Risk Analysis|publisher= Association for Risk Analysis|accessdate = 30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
In early 1979, [[Robert B. Cumming]] recognized the growing need for risk researchers and practitioners to publish their work in a dedicated [[scientific journal]]. This led to the formation of an organization to support such a journal, with the [[certificate of incorporation]] for the SRA made official on August 28, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2005.00702.x |title=Interdisciplinary Vision: The First 25 Years of the Society for Risk Analysis (SRA), 1980-2005 |year=2005 |last1=Thompson |first1=Kimberly M. |last2=Deisler |first2=Paul F. |last3=Schwing |first3=Richard C. |journal=Risk Analysis |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=1333–86 |pmid=16506968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of [[Risk Analysis (journal)|''Risk Analysis'']] appeared in March 1981.

== SRA's interests: risk analysis among others ==
SRA broadly defines risk analysis to include [[risk assessment]], risk characterization, risk communication, [[risk management]], and policy relating to [[risk]]. The society's interests include: risk perception, risks to human health and the environment, both built and natural; threats from physical, chemical, and biological agents and from a variety of human activities as well as natural events; and risks of concern to individuals, to public and private sector organizations, and to society at various geographic scales. SRA publishes a glossary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org/sites/default/files/pdf/SRA-glossary-approved22june2015-x.pdf|title= Glossary|publisher= Society for Risk Analysis|accessdate = 28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of definitions of key terms related to risk and fundamental principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org/sites/default/files/u1201/Risk%20analysis%20principles%20Nov%205%20-%202017.pdf|title= Fundamental Principles|publisher= Society for Risk Analysis|accessdate = 28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for high quality risk analysis.

== Awards ==
Since the first awards were given in 1984, SRA continues to value outstanding contributions to the society and to the field of risk analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org/awards|title= Awards|publisher= Society for Risk Analysis|accessdate = 30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are its most-sought annual awards:

'''Springfields''' is a [[nuclear fuel|nuclear fuel production installation]] in [[Salwick]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], [[England]] ({{gbmapping|SD468315}}). The site is currently operated by Springfields Fuels Limited, under the management of [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse Electric UK Limited]], on a 150-year lease from the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]].&lt;ref name=independent-20170330&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/westinghouse-bankruptcy-is-the-future-of-uk-nuclear-power-in-uk-doubt-toshiba-a7658001.html |title=Westinghouse bankruptcy: Is the future of nuclear power in the UK in doubt? |first=Ben |last=Chapman |newspaper=The Independent |date=30 March 2017 |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its conversion from a [[munitions]] factory in 1946, it has previously been operated and managed by a number of different organisations including the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] and [[British Nuclear Fuels]].&lt;ref name=westinghouse&gt;{{cite web|title=Westinghouse|url=http://www.nuclearsites.co.uk/page.php?pageID=85|work=Westinghouse website on nuclear sites|accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel products are produced for the [[Nuclear_power_in_the_United_Kingdom#Power_stations|UK’s nuclear power stations]] and for international customers.

==Activities on the site==
The site has been making [[nuclear fuel]]s since the mid-1940s. The site is notable for being the first nuclear plant in the world to produce fuel for a commercial power station ([[Sellafield#Calder_Hall_nuclear_power_station|Calder Hall]]).&lt;ref name="westinghouse"/&gt;

The four main activities carried out on the site are:&lt;ref name=westinghousenuclear-2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westinghousenuclear.com/Portals/2/Documents/Brochure%20Nuclear_Leaflet_04.pdf |title=Nuclear Fuel Manufacture at Springfields |publisher=Wesinghouse |year=2014 |format=PDF brochure |accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Production of oxide fuels for [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor|advanced gas-cooled]] and [[light water reactor]]s, as well as intermediate fuel products ([[uranium dioxide]] powders, granules, and pellets)
*Production of [[uranium hexafluoride]], or "hex"
*Processing of [[Nuclear fuel cycle|fuel-cycle]] residues
*[[Nuclear decommissioning|Decommissioning]] and demolition of redundant plants and buildings&lt;ref name="westinghouse"/&gt;

==Future of the plant==
Manufacture is scheduled to continue until 2023. Decommissioning activities have so far resulted in 87 buildings on the site having been fully demolished.&lt;ref name=nda&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Decommissioning Agency|url=http://www.nda.gov.uk/sites/springfields|work=Decommissioning at Springfields site|accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''swim diaper''' is a [[diaper]] that is made for those who are [[Fecal incontinence|incontinent]], usually babies or young children, which is worn underneath a [[bathing suit]], or as a bathing suit. Swim diapers can be reusable and disposable. They are not intended to be absorbent.&lt;ref name="Pull-Ups® and Swim Diapers are Not the Same Thing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schultz|first1=Hollie|title=Pull-Ups® and Swim Diapers are Not the Same Thing|url=https://www.babygizmo.com/pull-ups-and-swim-diapers-are-not-the-same-thing/|publisher=Baby Gizmo|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, it is assumed that a swim diaper should be absorbent, or contain urine, like a regular diaper. However, the purpose of a swim diaper is only to contain solid waste; the lack of absorbency prevents the swim diaper from swelling up with water.&lt;ref name="Buying a swim diaper"&gt;{{cite web|title=Buying a swim diaper|url=http://www.babycenter.ca/a567958/buying-a-swim-diaper|publisher=The Baby Center|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pregnancy, Birth and Babies – Myths and Misconceptions |url=https://babymommablog.com/ |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swimming Nappies Explained |url=https://www.babypaddlers.co.uk/blog/swimming-nappies-explained/ |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Often reusable swim diapers are lined with a fiber which encourages the solid waste to cling to the fiber without an absorbency layer. A snug fit in the legs and waist are key to function. Brands such as [[Splash About International|Splash About]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/northwest/news/202320-energize-splashes-out-on-baby-swimwear-firn.html|title=Energize splashes out on baby swimwear firm {{!}} TheBusinessDesk.com|date=2011-08-04|work=North West|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Honest Company|The Honest Co]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/travel/airports-get-more-friendly-for-parents-with-young-children.html?_r=0|title=Airports Get More Friendly for Parents With Young Children|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; use tightly knit [[polyester]] or [[neoprene]] as their material. The disadvantages of a reusable swim diaper is that they must be washed to be reused. On the other hand, a disposable swim diaper is only partially [[biodegradable]] and repeated purchases may cost more than reuse. One brand of disposable swim diapers is Little Swimmers, marketed under the [[Kimberly-Clark]] [[Huggies]] brand. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] produces the rival brand [[Pampers]] Splashers. Both are sold in three sizes: small (16–26&amp;nbsp;lb or 7–12&amp;nbsp;kg), medium (24–34&amp;nbsp;lb or 11–15&amp;nbsp;kg) and large (over 32&amp;nbsp;lb or 14&amp;nbsp;kg+). Due to their design for swimwear, they are not as absorbent and not intended for regular diapering.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Swim diapers at public pools==
Some public pools require swim diapers for use by young children and the incontinent out of hygiene concerns. For the same reason, other pools do not allow swim diapers at all. Sick children who are not potty-trained and do not wear swim diapers may be responsible for the transmission of [[e. coli infection|e. coli]] from fecal matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/family/ecolibabyswim_sont.htm |title=Prevent e.coli with swim diapers |publisher=Essortment.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swim diapers may not keep pool water clean, UF experts say"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swim diapers may not keep pool water clean, UF experts say|url=http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2007/07/swim-diapers-may-not-keep-pool-water-clean-uf-experts-say.html|publisher=University of Florida|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not used properly, or when using inferior products, health experts caution that swim diapers may not protect pool water against communicable diseases, such as [[norovirus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ufl.edu/2007/07/10/swim-diaper/ |title=University of Florida News - Swim diapers may not keep pool water clean, UF experts say |publisher=News.ufl.edu |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Table of selected pistol/submachine gun and rifle/machine gun cartridges by common name.  Data values are the highest found for the cartridge, and might not occur in the same load (e.g. the highest muzzle energy might not be in the same load as the highest muzzle velocity, since the bullet weights can differ between loads).

==Paleolithic==
* 30,600 BC – [[Pestle]] used as a tool in southern Italy to grind oats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/09/02/1505213112.abstract] Multistep food plant processing at Grotta Paglicci (Southern Italy) around 32,600 cal B.P.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neolithic Revolution==
* 8,500 BC – [[Neolithic Revolution]], the first agricultural revolution, begins in the [[ancient Near East]]
* 8,000 BC – was [[domesticated]] [[wheat]] at [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]] sites in the Levant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4758">The '''UWA telerobot''' is a [[teleoperation|teleoperable]] [[industrial robot|robot]] belonging to the school of mechanical and civil engineering at the [[University of Western Australia]].
==Development==
The UWA telerobot is a historic landmark for the [[Internet]] and The University of Western Australia. It was the first [[Telerobotics|telerobot]] device  made available for general use on the Internet in 1994.  The UWA telerobot was originally developed as part of a [[PhD]] thesis by Kenneth Taylor&lt;ref name='taylor'&gt;Taylor, K. [http://www.urremote.com/index.php?title=WebTelerobotic_Introduction Web Telerobotics: Reducing complexity in Robotics] Retrieved on 2009-3-15&lt;/ref&gt;  and was the subject of a later PhD by Barney Dalton.&lt;ref name='dalton'&gt;Dalton, B. [http://telerobot.mech.uwa.edu.au/Information/Dalton%20thesis.pdf Techniques for Web Telerobotics] Retrieved on 2009-3-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The first robot on the Internet, a plastic toy robot with only 2 [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]], was placed online by a team under [[Ken Goldberg]] at the [[University of Southern California]]&lt;ref&gt;University of Southern California [http://www.usc.edu/dept/raiders/ Mercury Project] Retrieved on 2009-3-15&lt;/ref&gt; only three weeks before the [[University of Western Australia|UWA]] team released their website. The [[University of Southern California|USC]] robot only lasted for seven months. The UWA robot is still online today, although the original robot was replaced in 1996&lt;ref name='taylor'/&gt; and the robot is no longer available for unrestricted public access, though interested parties can request permission.&lt;ref&gt;University of Western Australia [http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/forms/register.html Telelabs Registration] Retrieved on 2009-3-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
The current UWA telerobot is an [[Asea Brown Boveri|ABB]] IRB1400 model 6 DOF serial chain robot fitted with a [[pneumatic]] gripper attachment. The robot runs on a standard ABB  S4 Robot Controller linked to a [[Linux]] server and which in turn communicates with a second server running [[Asea Brown Boveri|ABB]]'s RobComm software and a [[National Instruments]] [[Labview]] application that was custom written for the task by [[James Trevelyan]] with assistance from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]-based Icon Technologies and students.&lt;ref name='newell'/&gt; The robot forms part of the UWA telelabs project.&lt;ref&gt;University of Western Australia [http://telerobot.mech.uwa.edu.au/index.html Telelabs Project] Retrieved on 2009-3-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Telerobot]] has undergone many changes to its control structure over time. Originally controlled via static [[html]] web pages using [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]], work by Dalton saw the introduction of an [[augmented reality]] [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based interface that met with limited success.&lt;ref name='dalton'/&gt; Control is currently by way of a downloadable [[LabVIEW]] [[client (computing)|client]] application that incorporates real-time video streaming, with access control provided by the Telelabs system.&lt;ref name='newell'&gt;Newell, James [http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/year4/Current/Students/Files/2004/JamesNewell/CorrectedDissertation.pdf Implementing a remote laboratory for the Telerobot] Retrieved on 2009-3-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
The robot continues to be the basis for research and group projects undertaken by [[Mechatronics]] [[Engineering]] students and staff at [[University of Western Australia|UWA]], Primarily involving the addition of new features or capabilities to the system. The robot is also used as a teaching aid for a course in [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]] and multibody systems run by [[Karol Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, K.
