'''Adhesion procedure''', '''adhesive procedure''' or '''ancillary proceedings''' is a [[Procedural law|procedure]] through which a [[Court|court of law]] can rule on [[Compensatory damages|compensation]] for the victim of a [[criminal offense]]. Rather than pursuing damages in a separate [[civil action]], the victim files a civil claim against the offender as a part of a [[criminal trial]].

This system exists in some [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law jurisdictions]], including [[Austria]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefoe.at/tl_files/lefoe/Study_Compensation_Austria%204.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Czech Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://is.muni.cz/th/108097/pravf_m/|title=Adhezní řízení|first=MACHOVÁ,|last=Lucie|date=20 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/RS_No56/No56_12VE_Siegismund1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1698123|title=Legal Reform on Behalf of Victims of Crime: The Primacy of the Dutch Legislature in a Changing International Environment|first1=Marc|last1=Groenhuijsen|first2=Rianne|last2=Letschert|date=26 October 2010|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Slovakia]].

'''Alfred Neobard Palmer''' (10 July 1847–7 March 1915) was a chemist and [[local history|local historian]]. He published several books concerning the local history of [[Wrexham]] and north Wales.

==Biography==

Alfred Neobard Palmer was born in [[Thetford]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]], on 10 July 1847 to Alfred Palmer and Harriet Catherine (née Neobard). He had a younger brother and sister, John and Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;1851 Census Class: HO107; Piece: 1832; Folio: 355; Page: 4; GSU roll: 207487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1861 Census Class: RG9; Piece: 1267; Folio: 50; Page: 27; GSU roll: 542787&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1878, he married  Esther (Ettie) Francis in [[City of Salford|Salford]], [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;England &amp; Wales, FreeBMD Marriage Index: 1837-1915 Vol.8d Page 233&lt;/ref&gt; They had no children.

He attended [[Thetford Grammar School]] from 1855 to 1860 and then a private academy from 1860 to 1862, where he discovered an interest in natural science.&lt;ref name="llgc"&gt;National Library of Wales http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-PALM-NEO-1847.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer became a teacher in [[Cambridgeshire]] for a short time, but in 1863 started work for a chemist in [[Bury St. Edmunds]]. In 1874, he became an analytical chemist with a company in [[Manchester]], where he met and married Ettie. He later moved to Wrexham, [[Wales]] and in September 1880 he took up employment with the Zoedone Mineral Water Company, where he worked until 1882. He also worked for the [[Brymbo Steelworks]] Company where he was appointed chief chemist, but had to leave after two years due to ill health. Some sources report&lt;ref name="llgc"/&gt; that his time at [[Brymbo]] was from 1882 to 1884, others&lt;ref name="WCBC"&gt;Wrexham Council http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/heritage/famous_people/an_palmer.htm&lt;/ref&gt; from 1884 to 1886.

After leaving [[Brymbo]] he set up in private practice as an analytical chemist in Chester Street, Wrexham,&lt;ref name="WCBC"/&gt; but later worked from 1891 to 1904 at the Cambrian Leather Works.

Palmer's first work on local history was ''The Town, Fields and Folk of Wrexham in the Time of James the First'' (1883), based on a 1620 survey of the Lordship of Bromfield and Yale by [[John Norden]]. He went on to write 10 books and many articles on local history and archaeology, of which ''The History of Ancient Tenures of Land in the Marches of North Wales'', 1885, was regarded both by himself and other scholars as his best work.&lt;ref name="llgc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/guides/halloffame/arts/alfred_palmer.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

His health and finances deteriorated with each book he wrote, the latter particularly after the publication of an unsuccessful novel, ''Owen Tanat'' (1897).&lt;ref name="llgc"/&gt; However, his financial situation improved in 1892 and 1894 when he received two legacies and in 1905 when he was awarded a Civil List pension. 

He died on 7 March 1915 in Wrexham and was buried at Wrexham Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations),1861-1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

In commemoration of his work on the history of the area, [[Wrexham County Borough Council]] have named their local history centre after him: [[A.N. Palmer Centre for Local Studies and Archives]] and there is a plaque to him in the Centre. It was originally unveiled by [[Thomas Scott-Ellis, 8th Baron Howard de Walden|Lord Howard de Walden]] at the old Wrexham Public Library on Queen's Square on 29 November 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Wrexham Council http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/heritage/archives/an_palmer.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Amaury de Riencourt]&lt;/ref&gt; was a writer, [[historian]], an expert on Southeast Asia, Indian scholar, sinologist, tibetologist and Americanist.&lt;ref name="outlook India"&gt;{{en icon}} [[K. Natwar Singh]], [http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?217848  Forgotten Prophet], Outlook India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amaury de Riencourt, [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/37137/amaury-de-riencourt/india-and-pakistan-in-the-shadow-of-afghanistan India and Pakistan in the Shadow of Afghanistan], 1982/83, [[Foreign Affairs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amaury de Riencourt was born in Orleans in a family of the French nobility which dates back at least to the 12th century.&lt;ref name="outlook India" /&gt; He graduated from university in the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and held a Master's degree from the [[University of Algiers]].&lt;ref name="alainjoly"&gt;Alain Joly, [http://pagesperso-orange.fr/alainjoly1/etude02.htm Amaury de Riencourt]&lt;/ref&gt;

de Riencourt served in the French Navy during the earlier part of the Second World War (1939-40).

In 1947, he visited [[Tibet]] and stayed in Lhasa where he remained for five months,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jamyang Norbu]], [http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/3246 Black Annals: Goldstein &amp; The Negation Of Tibetan History (Part I)], Shadow of Tibet, 19 juillet 2008&lt;/ref&gt;. He met the Dalai Lama, who declared that the country was governed in all areas as an independent nation, adding that the orders of his government were obeyed across the country.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.tpprc.org/publication/political_philosophy_of_his_holiness-shiromany-1998.pdf The Political Philosophy of His Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama, Selected Speeches and Writings]'', 1998, Édité par A.A. Shiromany, Tibetan Parliamentary and Policy Research Centre, [[Tenzin Gyatso|dalaï-lama]], lettre au Secrétaire général de l'ONU datée du 9 septembre 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Riencourt's magnum opus was probably ''The Coming Caesars'' [1957], which explores the ethnic and ideological roots of America, Europe and Russia, comparing also classical times with the contemporary world (19th-20th centuries). He also wrote a number of other books (all written in English), including ''The American Empire''; ''Lost World: Tibet''; ''The Eye of Shiva''; ''The Soul of China''; ''The Soul of India''; ''Woman and Power in History''; ''Sex and Power in History''; ''Roof of the World: Tibet'', and an autobiography entitled ''A Child of the Century''

[[Image:Head Amazon Musei Capitolini MC1091.jpg|200px|thumb|Head of the Sosicles Amazon types, found in the [[Gardens of Maecenas]], 1874 (Capitoline Museums)]]

[[Pliny the Elder]] records five bronze statues of [[Amazons]] in the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemision]] of [[Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny's Natural History|Nat Hist.]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/34*.html#75 34.75].&lt;/ref&gt; He explains the existence of such a quantity of sculptures on the same theme in the same place by describing a 5th-century BC competition between the artists [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]], [[Phidias]], [[Kresilas]], "Kydon"&lt;ref&gt;The designation of a "Kydon type" among surviving examples has been explained by a textual mistaking of Kresilas's place of birth - [[Kydonia]] - for the name of a fifth sculptor; [[Gisela Richter]] observed, however, that ''Kydon'' is not attested as an ethnic designation, but is well known as a given name (Richter, "Pliny's five Amazons", ''Archaeology'' '''12''' [1959:111-15]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Phradmon]]; thus:

{{cquote|The most celebrated of these artists, though born at different epochs, have joined in a trial of skill in the Amazons which they have respectively made. When these statues were dedicated in the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, it was agreed, in order to ascertain which was the best, that it should be left to the judgment of the artists themselves who were then present: upon which, it was evident that that was the best, which all the artists agreed in considering as the next best to his own. Accordingly, the first rank was assigned to Polycletus, the second to Phidias, the third to Cresilas, the fourth to Cydon, and the fifth to Phradmon.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', John Bostock, M.D., F.R.S., H.T. Riley, Esq., B.A. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plin.+Nat.+34.19&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137#note-link47 Book XXXIV, Chapter XIX]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This anecdote encouraged the much-discussed identifications of four known types of Roman marble copies of the wounded Amazon with sculptors of lost originals that may be dated to 430 BC on stylistic grounds.  These types, each well represented by numerous Roman copies and heads, are identified with three of Pliny's five sculptors; a type derived from Phradmon has not been identified.  Of these, however, only the identification of the Mattei type as deriving from Phidias's original is undisputed.  The assignment of the Sciarra-type as deriving from Polyclitus's original and Sosicles-type as deriving from Kresilas's original (or vice versa), on the other hand, is unestablished, although having been discussed since 1897.  The German scholar R. Bolnach has written a thorough form-analysis for the Sciarra/Polycletus and Sosikles/Kresilas pairings.

[[Dietrich von Bothmer]] dismissed the Plinian anecdote as an [[Etiology|etiological]] embroidery&lt;ref&gt;"Pliny's account... may well be an embroidered anecdote prompted by the presence of four statues of the same subject in the same sanctuary by different artists" (von Bothmer, ''Amazons in Greek Art'', Oxford 1957:212, quoted in , p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt; invented to account for the five statues of wounded Amazons of varying styles. [[Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway]] presented her doubts ("it is difficult to see why all five Amazons were set up if only one 'won' and became the object of the dedication"), noting Pliny's awareness of the discrepancies in age of the sculptors;&lt;ref&gt;''"quamquam diversis aetatibus geniti"''.&lt;/ref&gt; she presented an alternative, cumulative origin, building on fifth century prototypes, added to by [[Phradmon]], whom she identifies as a fourth-century sculptor, and supplemented by later classicizing models.&lt;ref&gt;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/503751 "A Story of Five Amazons",] ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' '''78'''.1 (January 1974:1-17).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The usual designations of the statues, following Adolf Furtwängler, group them under the headings the Lansdowne type, the Capitoline type, the Mattei type and the single example known as the Villa Doria Pamphilj type.&lt;ref&gt;Ridgeway 1974:2ff&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth type was excavated at the theater of Ephesus in 1898 but did not enter the discussion until the 1950s.

All five types show a standing female with a similar head and face, and (as with the [[Venus Genetrix (sculpture)|Venus Genetrix]]) are clothed in a [[peplos]] that has fallen from one or both shoulders to leave her bare-breasted.  Their differences are most obvious when the three sculptures, or casts therof, are displayed together, as at the Casts Gallery at the [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] [[Classics]] Faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk:591/casts/FMPro |title=Casts |access-date=2007-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217075523/http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk:591/casts/FMPro |archive-date=2004-12-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pose, with one arm resting on the head, is comparable to that of the [[Apollo Lykeios]].

[[Image:Amazon03 pushkin.jpg|thumb|300px|Wounded Amazon, "Lansdowne type", said to be after Polyclitus (Cast in Pushkin Museum)]]

===Amazon Mattei type===
The prototype was discovered in 1770, as a marble Roman copy of a bronze original, and came into the [[Mattei (Rome)|Mattei]] collection.
2.11m high, and of the [[Augustus|Augustan]] era, this type is derived from Phidias's original.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk:591/casts/FMPro?-db=casts%20searchable.fp3&amp;-format=record%5fdetail.htm&amp;-lay=screensize&amp;-op=eq&amp;NAME=Amazon&amp;-max=10&amp;-recid=33030&amp;-find=]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now on display in the Gallerie delle Statue of the Pio-Clementine Museum in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203022045/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/art-4178]&lt;/ref&gt;  The figure looks down, with her right arm parrying and her left arm by her side with a quiver under it, though both arms, the head, and the left shoulder are all restorations. Another copy of this type is at the [[Capitoline Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.museicapitolini.org/percorsi/percorsi_per_sale/museo_capitolino/sala_del_gladiatore/statua_di_amazzone_ferita |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007041759/http://www.museicapitolini.org/percorsi/percorsi_per_sale/museo_capitolino/sala_del_gladiatore/statua_di_amazzone_ferita |archive-date=2007-10-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amazon Sciarra type===
1.94 m high, this copy dates to the era of [[Tiberius]] and is derived from Polyclitus's or Kresilas's original.  It was found in Rome in 1868 in the [[Gardens of Sallust]], and is now in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], [[Copenhagen]],&lt;ref&gt;Accession number K176.&lt;/ref&gt;  The figure is resting her left arm on a column and her right hand behind her head, with her face leaning to one side.  Her nose, right arm from the [[deltoid muscle]] downwards, the left forearm below the elbow, both hands, and the right foot and ankle have all been restored since discovery.

===Amazon "Capitoline" or Sosicles type===
[[Image:Wounded amazon, Rome.jpg|thumb|160px|right|''Wounded Amazon'', Roman copy signed by Sosikles]]
This type is known principally from the 2.02 m high 2nd century AD marble copy (signed by [[Sosicles (sculptor)|Sosicles]]), deriving from Polyclitus's or Kresilas's original.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk:591/casts/FMPro?-db=casts%20searchable.fp3&amp;-format=record%5fdetail.htm&amp;-lay=screensize&amp;-op=eq&amp;NAME=Amazon&amp;-max=10&amp;-recid=33026&amp;-find=]; ''Künstlerlexikon der Antike'' II (2004) 411 s.v. "Sosikles" (R. Vollkommer); Hans von Steuben: "Die Amazone des Polyklet", in: ''Polykletforschungen'', ed. by Herbert Beck and Dieter Bol, Berlin 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;73-102&lt;/ref&gt;  It was discovered in 1733, went into the collection of Cardinal [[Giuseppe Albani]], and is now in the [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome (Room 33).  The figure has her left arm across her body below her breasts, and her right hand raised and open-palmed, as she looks down towards the wound in her right-hand side.  She wears a [[baldric]].  The tip of nose, lower lip, left forearm, and hand with drapery have been restored since discovery.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080326211311/http://www.museicapitolini.org/percorsi/percorsi_per_sale/museo_capitolino/salone/statua_di_amazzone_ferita_firmata_da_sosikles]

It was (before and after Sosicles's time) copied as a complete statue, as a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] or as a [[Herma|herm]], both in stone in the same size as the original and in miniature in [[bronze]].

===Lansdowne Amazon===
A possible fourth is the Lansdowne Amazon, said to have been found in [[Tor Colombara]] by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], though it may be a variant on the Sciarra-type. Later at [[Lansdowne House]], it is now at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/god1/hod_32.11.4.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art].&lt;/ref&gt;  Half of the nose, the right arm from middle of the biceps to wrist, the tip of the thumb, and other details have been restored since discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk:591/casts/FMPro?-db=casts%20searchable.fp3&amp;-format=record%5fdetail.htm&amp;-lay=screensize&amp;-op=eq&amp;NAME=Amazon&amp;-max=10&amp;-recid=33027&amp;-find=]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villa Doria Pamphilj Amazon===
Adolf Furtwängler attributed a much-restored ''Wounded Amazon'' at the [[Villa Doria Pamphilj]], Rome, to the Ephesus group, an attribution that was challenged in 1951 by C.P. Sestieri,&lt;ref&gt;Sestieri, "Alla ricerca di [[Phradmon]]", ''''ArchCl'' '''3''' (1951:13-32) p. 16, noted by Ridgway 1974:3 and note 10.&lt;/ref&gt; who identified the sculpture instead as a classicising Roman work, and a representation of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].&lt;ref&gt;The dog is part of the extensive restoration; the remains of a hand resting on the head, not an attribute of Artemis/Diana, were noted by Ridgway 1974:4&lt;/ref&gt; Dietrich von Bothmer's systematic study omitted the Dori-Pamphilj sculpture as insecurely identified and too much restored, while H. von Steuben in W. Helbig, ''Führer durch die öffentlichen Sammlungen klassischer Altertümer in Rom'', (Tübingen) 4th ed. identifies it as an eclectic classicizing work modelled on the Lansdowne ''Wounded Amazon''.

==Ephesus Amazon==
A fifth Amazon type was unearthed at the theatre of [[Ephesus]] in 1898 but languished unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;F. Eichler, "Eine neue Amazone und andere Skulpturen aus dem Theater von Ephesos," ''ÖJh'' '''43''' (1956/58:7-18); [[Gisela Richter]], "Pliny's five Amazons", ''Archaeology'' '''12''' (1959:111-15).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buthrotum''' ({{lang-la|Buthrōtum}}; from {{lang-grc|Βουθρωτόν|''Bouthrōtón''}}) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and later [[Roman Empire|Roman]] city and bishopric in [[Epirus]].&lt;ref name=Borza&gt;{{cite book | first= Eugene N.| last= Borza | title= In the Shadow of Olympus: the Emergence of Macedon (Revised Edition) | publisher= Princeton University Press | location= Princeton, New Jersey | year= 1992}} "Speakers of these various Greek dialects settled different parts of Greece at different times during the Middle Bronze Age, with one group, the 'northwest' Greeks, developing their own dialect and peopling central Epirus. This was the origin of the Molossian or Epirotic tribes." "[...] a proper dialect of Greek, like the dialects spoken by Dorians and Molossians." "The western mountains were peopled by the Molossians (the western Greeks of Epirus)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAH&gt;{{cite book | first= P. Mack | last= Crew | title= The Cambridge Ancient History – The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries B.C., Part 3: Volume 3 (Second Edition) | publisher= Cambridge University Press | location= Cambridge, UK | year= 1982}} "That the Molossians... spoke Illyrian or another barbaric tongue was nowhere suggested, although [[Aeschylus]] and [[Pindar]] wrote of Molossian lands. That they in fact spoke greek was implied by [[Herodotus]]' inclusion of Molossi among the Greek colonists of Asia Minor, but became demonstrable only when D. Evangelides published two long inscriptions of the Molossian State, set up p. 369 B.C at [[Dodona]], in Greek and with Greek names, Greek patronymies and Greek tribal names such as Celaethi, Omphales, Tripolitae, Triphylae etc. As the Molossian cluster of tribes in the time of Hecataeus included the Orestae, Pelagones, Lyncestae, Tymphaei and Elimeotae, as we have argued above, we may be confindent that they too were Greek-speaking."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{cite book | first= NGL | last= Hammond | title= Philip of Macedon | publisher= Duckworth |location= London, UK | year= 1994}} "Epirus was a land of milk and animal products.... The social unit was a small tribe, consisting of several nomadic or semi-nomadic groups, and these tribes, of which more than seventy names are known, coalesced into large tribal coalitions, three in number: Thesprotians, Molossians and Chaonians.... We know from the discovery of inscriptions that these tribes were speaking the Greek language (in a West-Greek dialect)"&lt;/ref&gt; Inhabited since prehistoric times, Buthrotum was a city of the [[Greeks|Greek]] tribe of the [[Chaonians]], later a Roman colony and a [[bishop]]ric. It entered into decline in [[Late Antiquity]], before being abandoned during the Middle Ages after a major earthquake flooded most of the city. In modern times it is an [[archaeology|archeological]] site in [[Vlorë County]], [[Albania]], some 14&amp;nbsp;kilometres south of [[Sarandë]] and close to the [[Greece|Greek]] border. It is located on a hill overlooking the [[Vivari Channel]] and is part of the [[Butrint National Park]]. Today Bouthrotum is a Latin Catholic [[titular see]].

The city is considered as one of the most important [[archaeological site]]s in Albania. On the strength of the immense wealth of [[Culture|cultural]], [[History|historical]] and [[Nature|natural]] value with a considerable history, Butrint was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] in 1992 and further a [[Butrint National Park|National Park]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]]|title = Butrint|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PER SHPALLJEN PARK KOMBETAR NE MBROJTJE TE SHTETIT TE ZONES ARKEOLOGJIKE TE BUTRINTIT|url=http://www.imk.gov.al/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/VKM-Nr.82-date-2.3.2000-PER-SHPALLJEN-PARK-KOMBETAR-NE-MBROJTJE-TE-SHTETIT-BUTRINTIT.pdf|website=imk.gov.al|language=Albanian|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Northwester Greeks and Southern Illyrian tribes.png|thumb|250px|left|The location of the settlement and neighboring tribes in antiquity]]

''Bouthroton'' (modern day Butrint) was originally a town within the Adriatic Balkan region of Epirus. It was one of the major centres of the Greek tribe of the [[Chaonians]],&lt;ref&gt;Strabo. ''The Geography''. Book VII, Chapter 7.5 ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/7G*.html LacusCurtius]).&lt;/ref&gt; with close contacts to the [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]] colony of [[Korkyra (polis)|Corcyra]] (modern [[Corfu]]). According to the Roman writer [[Virgil]], its legendary founder was the seer [[Helenus]], a son of [[Priam|king Priam]] [[Troy|of Troy]], who had moved West after the fall of Troy with [[Neoptolemus]] and his concubine [[Andromache]]. Both Virgil and the Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] recorded that [[Aeneas]] visited ''Bouthroton'' after his own escape from the destruction of Troy.

The earliest archaeological evidence of settled occupation dates to between 10th and 8th centuries BC, although some claim that there is earlier evidence of habitation in the 12th century BC.&lt;ref name=ceka&gt;{{cite book | last = Ceka | first = Neritan | authorlink = Neritan Ceka |author2=transl.

=== Ancient Greek period ===

Excavation at Bouthroton has yielded [[Proto-Corinthian]] pottery of the 7th century and then [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]] and [[Attica|Attic]] pottery of the 6th century, however there are no indications of a prehistoric settlement.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 3: The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries BC, p. 269, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-23447-4}}, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Bouthroton'' was in a strategically important position due its access to the Straits of Corfu. By the 4th century BC it had grown in importance and included a theatre, a sanctuary dedicated to [[Asclepius]] and an [[agora]]. Around 380&amp;nbsp;BC, the settlement was fortified with a new 870m-long wall, with five gates, enclosing an area of 4ha.&lt;ref&gt;Ceka, p22&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek calendar of Bouthroton appears in the oldest known computer, the so-called [[Antikythera Mechanism]] (c. 150 to 100 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Freeth, Tony; Bitsakis, Yanis; Moussas, Xenophon; Seiradakis, John.

=== Ancient Roman period ===

In 228&amp;nbsp;BC ''Buthrotum'' became a Roman [[protectorate]] alongside Corfu. In the next century, it became a part of a province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. In 44&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] designated ''Buthrotum'' as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] to reward soldiers who had fought for him against [[Pompey]]. Local landholder [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]] objected to his correspondent [[Cicero]] who lobbied against the plan in the Senate. As a result, only small numbers of colonists were settled.

In 31&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]] fresh from his victory over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the [[battle of Actium]] renewed the plan to make ''Buthrotum'' a veterans' colony. New residents expanded the city and the construction included an [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]], a [[Roman bath]], houses, a forum complex and a [[nymphaeum]]. During that era the size of the town was doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodges|first1=Richard|last2=Bowden|first2=William|last3=Lako|first3=Kosta|author4=Richard Andrews|title=Byzantine Butrint: excavations and surveys 1994–1999|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3lpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Butrint+%2B+Roman+%2B+Vivari&amp;q=Roman+Butrint+was+more+than+twice+as+big+as+the+town+was+in+the+1st+century+BC#search_anchor|accessdate=8 January 2011|year=2004|publisher=Oxbow Books|isbn=978-1-84217-158-5|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century AD, an [[earthquake]] destroyed a large part of the town, levelling buildings in the suburbs on the Vrina Plain and in the forum of the city centre. Excavations have revealed that city had already been in decline. However, the settlement survived into the late antique era, becoming a major port in the province of Old Epirus. The town of late antiquity included the grand ''Triconch Palace'', the house of a major local notable that was built around 425.

=== Byzantine and Slavic period ===

The walls of the city were extensively rebuilt, most probably at the end of the 5th century, perhaps by [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius]]. The [[Ostrogoths]] under [[Indulf (6th century)|Indulf]] raided the Ionian coast in 550 and may have attacked Buthrotum. Evidence from the excavations shows that importation of commodities, wine and oil from the Eastern Mediterranean continued into the early years of the 7th century when the early Byzantine Empire [[Muslim conquests|lost these provinces]]. In this, it follows the historical pattern seen in other Balkanic cities, with the 6th to 7th century being a watershed for the transformation of the Roman world into the Early Middle Ages.

[[File:2011_Butrint_02_Agora.jpg|thumb|293px|The [[Agora]] of Buthrotum]]

By the 7th century, following the model of classical cities throughout the Mediterranean, Buthrotum had shrunk to a much smaller fortified post and with the collapse of Roman power was briefly controlled by [[First Bulgarian Empire]] before being regained by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the 9th century.

=== Venetian period ===

It remained an outpost of the Byzantine empire fending off assaults from the [[Normans]] until 1204 when following the [[Fourth Crusade]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] fragmented, Buthrotum falling to the breakaway [[Despotate of Epirus]]. In the following centuries, the area was a site of conflict between the Byzantines, the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] of southern Italy, and the [[Venice|Venetians]], and the city changed hands many times. In 1267, [[Charles of Anjou]] took control of both Buthrotum and Corfu, leading to further restorations of the walls and the Great Basilica.
The dogal [[Republic of Venice]] purchased the area including Corfu from the Angevins in 1386; however, the Venetian merchants were principally interested in Corfu and Buthrotum once again declined.[[File:Butrint (Buthrotum, Butrinto). Venetian enclave facing Corfu..jpg|thumb|200px|Butrinto, a Venetian enclave on the Ottoman mainland]] 

=== Ottoman period ===

By 1572 the wars between Venice and the [[Ottoman Empire]] had left Buthrotum ruinous and at the order of Domenico Foscarini, the Venetian commander of Corfu, the administration of Buthrotum and its environs was shifted to a small triangular fortress associated with the extensive fish weirs. The area was lightly settled afterwards, occasionally being seized by the Ottoman Turks, in 1655 and 1718, before being recaptured by the Venetians. Its fisheries were a vital contributor to the supply of Corfu, and olive growing together with cattle and timber were the principal economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;During his short career as an ensign in a Venetian regiment, 20-year-old [[Casanova]] spent 3&amp;nbsp;days on Butrinto guarding galley slaves cutting and loading timber on 4 galleys. He mentions the objective of this once-a-year routine was mainly to 'show the flag' and safeguard Venice's rights to that nearly deserted outpost.

The [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] of 1797 split between France and Austria the territory of the Republic of Venice, which France had just occupied and abolished, and under article 5 of the treaty, Butrinto and the other former Venetian enclaves in Albania came under French sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_campoformio1.html|title=Treaty of Campo Formio 1797|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, in 1799, the local [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] governor [[Ali Pasha Tepelena]] conquered it, and it became a part of the Ottoman Empire until Albania gained its independence in 1913. By that time, the site of the original city had been unoccupied for centuries and was surrounded by malarial marshes.

=== Modern Albania ===
 
In 1913, after the end of the [[First Balkan War]], Butrint was ceded to [[Greece]] but Italy challenged the decision and in the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] the region was given to the newly created Albania. The local Greek population was enraged and created an [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus|autonomous republic of  Epirus  Vetus]], for six months, before it was reluctantly ceded to Albania, with peace assured by Italian peacekeeping force until 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hodges | first = Richard | title = The Archaeology of Mediterranean Placemaking: Butrint and the Global Heritage Industry| url = https://books.google.gr/books?id=65gnDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| publisher = Bloomsbury Academic| date=November 2016| page = 23| isbn = 978-1350006621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy rejected the decision because she didn't want Greece to control both sides of the [[Straits of Corfu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Lyse Hansen| first1 = Inge| last2 = Hodges| first2 = Richard| last3 = Leppard| first3 = Sarah| title = Butrint 4: The Archaeology and Histories of an Ionian Town| url = https://books.google.gr/books?id=2X9-AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| publisher = Oxbow Books| date=January 2013| pages = 2, 309| isbn = 978-1842174623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecclesiastical history ==

=== Residential bishopric ===
[[File:Butrint-Basilica-20071001.jpg|thumb|293px|The Basilica in Butrint]]

In the early 6th century, Buthrotum became the seat of a bishopric and new construction included the [[The Butrint baptistry|Buthrotum baptistery]], one of the largest such paleochristian buildings of its type, and a [[basilica]]. The diocese of Buthrotum was initially a [[suffragan]] of the [[Metropolis of Nicopolis]], the metropolitan capital of [[Epirus Vetus]] and in the papal sway, but in the 9th and 10th centuries it is listed with the suffragans of [[Metropolis of Naupaktos|Naupaktos]], which succeeded ruined Nicopolis as provincial capital and metropolis of the new Byzantine [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Nicopolis (theme)|Nicopolis]],&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gelzer, [https://archive.org/stream/abhandlungenbay06klasgoog#page/n596/mode/1up ''Ungedruckte und ungenügend veröffentlichte Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum''], in: Abhandlungen der philosophisch-historische classe der [[Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften]], 1901, p. 557, nº 564.&lt;/ref&gt; bringing it in the sway of the Byzantine [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. After the 14th century, it was under the jurisdiction of the [[Metropolis of Ioannina]].
 
Two of its Byzantine (pre-Eastern Schism) bishops are mentioned in extant documents: 
* Stephanus signed the joint letter of the bishops of [[Epirus Vetus]] to Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] in the aftermath of the killing of Patriarch [[Proterius of Alexandria]] in 458
* Matthaeus signed the synodal letter of the bishops of the province to [[Pope Hormisdas]] in 516 concerning the ordination of Metropolitan John of Nicopolis.&lt;ref&gt;Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&amp;nbsp;430&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 139-142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Eubel, ''Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi'', [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002716&amp;mediaType=application/pdf vol. 1], p.&amp;nbsp;143&lt;/ref&gt; It became a [[Latin Church]] see under Angevin and Venetian rule.

=== Latin residential bishopric ===
A Latin see was established circa 1250 under the Italian name ''Butrinto'', functioning under [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule, but suppressed circa 1400. The 6th-century [[basilica]] was rebuilt by king [[Charles I of Naples]] in 1267.

;Known Latin bishops
* Nicola, [[Dominican Order|O.P.]] (? – 1311.02.15)
* Nicola, O.P. (1311.05.23 – ?)
* Nicola da Offida, [[Friars Minor|O.F.M.]] (? – 1349.06.15)
* Francesco (? – ?)
* Arnaldo Simone (? – 1355.02.13)
* Giacomo, O.P. (1356.10.12 – ?)
* Lazzarino, O.F.M. (1366.02.09 – ?)

=== Catholic titular see ===
Buthrotum is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a Latin titular see &lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 855&lt;/ref&gt; since the diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as [[titular bishopric]] of Buthrotum (Latin) / Butrinto (Curiate Italian) / Butrint (Albanian).

Following titular bishops have been nominated:
* Louis-Bertrand Tirilly, [[Picpus Fathers|SS.CC.]] (1953.11.16 – 1966.06.21) as last [[Apostolic Vicar]] of [[Apostolic Vicariate of Marquesas Islands|Marquesas Islands]] 
* George Frendo (7. 7. 2006 – 17. 11. 2016), [[Dominican Order|O.P.]], [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tiranë–Durrës|Archdiocese of Tiranë–Durrës]] ([[Albania]]) (7. 7. 2006 – 17. 11. 2016), also Secretary General of Episcopal Conference of Albania (2016.05.05 – ...)
* Friar Giovanni Salonia, [[Capuchin Franciscans|O.F.M. Cap.]], (10. 2. 2017 – resigned 27. 4. 2017) as Auxiliary Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Palermo|Archdiocese of Palermo]]
* [[Zdeněk Wasserbauer]] (* 16. 6. 1965), Auxiliary Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Prague]], since 19. 5. 2018

== Archaeological excavations ==
[[File:Arte romana, statua di soldato, I secolo ac- I dc, da butrinto.JPG|150px|thumb|Statue of a Roman soldier found in Buthrotum]]
The first modern archaeological excavations began in 1928 when the [[Fascism|Fascist]] government of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italy]] sent an expedition to Buthrotum. The aim was geopolitical rather than scientific, aiming to extend Italian hegemony in the area. The leader was an Italian archaeologist, [[Luigi Maria Ugolini]] who despite the political aims of his mission was a good archaeologist. Ugolini died in 1936, but the excavations continued until 1943 and the [[Second World War]]. They uncovered the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] part of the city including the "Lion Gate" and the "Scaean Gate" (named by Ugolini for the famous gate at [[Troy]] mentioned in the [[Homer]]ic ''[[Iliad]]'').

After the [[communism|communist]] government of [[Enver Hoxha]] took Albania over in 1944, foreign archaeological missions were banned. Albanian archaeologists including [[Hasan Ceka]] continued the work. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] visited the ruins in 1959 and suggested that Hoxha should turn the area into a submarine base. The Albanian Institute of Archaeology began larger scale excavations in the 1970s. Since 1993 further major excavations have taken place led by the [[Butrint Foundation]] in collaboration with the Albanian Institute of Archaeology. Recent excavations in the western defences of the city have revealed evidence of the continued use of the walls, implying the continuation of life in the town. The walls themselves certainly seem to have burnt down in the 9th century, but were subsequently repaired.

After the collapse of the communist regime in 1992, the new democratic government planned various major developments at the site. The same year remains of Buthrotum were included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]]. A major political and economic crisis in 1997 and lobbying stopped the airport plan and UNESCO placed it on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] because of [[looting]], lack of protection, management and conservation. Archaeological missions during 1994–9 uncovered further [[Roman villa]]s and an early Christian church.&lt;ref name="HodgesBowden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodges|first1=Richard|last2=Bowden|first2=William|last3=Lako|first3=Kosta|author4=Richard Andrews|title=Byzantine Butrint: excavations and surveys 1994–1999|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3lpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Butrint+%2B+Roman+%2B+Vivari&amp;q=Roman+villa#search_anchor|accessdate=8 January 2011|year=2004|publisher=Oxbow Books|isbn=978-1-84217-158-5|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Directions ==
The site of Buthrotum is accessible from [[Saranda]], along a road first built in 1959 for a visit by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. This road was upgraded during the summer of 2010. The construction was somewhat of an environmental disaster and may yet threaten Butrint's World Heritage Site status. The ancient city is becoming a popular tourist destination, attracting day-trippers from the nearby Greek holiday island of Corfu. Hydrofoils (30&amp;nbsp;minutes) and ferries (90&amp;nbsp;minutes) run daily between the New Port in [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] Town and Saranda. Many visitors from Corfu use chartered coach services to visit Butrint from Saranda, and additionally, a regular public bus service runs between Saranda port and Butrint. Others arrive from the Qafe Bote border crossing with Greece near Konispol and cross the Vivari Channel by the cable ferry at Butrint.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5622">'''Cabildos de nación''' were [[Africa]]n ethnic associations created in [[Cuba]] in the late 16th century based on the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[cofradías]] ([[guild]]s or [[Fraternal and service organizations|fraternities]]) that were organized in Seville for the first time around the 14th century. The Sevillian cofradías had the tutelage of a [[Catholic saint]] and were held in the saint’s [[chapel]].

"One of the earliest known ''Cabildos de nación'' in Cuba was Mandinga Zape (1568)"&lt;ref&gt;https://hlovejoy.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/h-lovejoy-thesis-2012.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cabildo on Compostela street in [[Havana]] was built in a lot purchased in 1691 by the Arará family. The same lot is still known as ''el solar de los Arará'' (the Arará’s lot). At the time the African population in Cuba was not as significant as it was after the 19th century with the [[sugar]] [[Boom and bust|boom]]. Cabildos were organized by slaves belonging to the same ethnic group and became very popular in the urban areas.

==Benefits brought by the ''cabildos''==
Spanish legislation supported the cabildos as means of entertainment for the [[slavery|slave]] population, and as social control alleviating the tensions between the masters and the slaves. Slaves were allowed to gather on holidays so that they could dance according to the customs of their African nations...

For the slaves, the cabildo had many uses. They were able to collect money or pool resources to assist members in times of illness or death. Cabildos also had a religious purpose, they were the place where slaves could consult their deities and ancestors. For those slaves who clung to the religious traditions of Africa, a ''cabildo'' was one of the few means of succor at their disposal. The cabildo represented Africa in foreign territory that would help slaves keep alive their faith. ''Cabildos'' were institutions that made possible the conservation of the idiosyncrasy, religion and culture of the African nations in Cuba. The songs, dances, and drum rhythms that were played for African deities in a land that was so hostile to the Africans slaves were the mechanism by which slaves were able to keep alive their Africanness and resist Spanish [[cultural hegemony]].

==Tensions caused by the ''cabildos''==
White Spanish and Cuban criollos saw cabildos as a necessary evil. By the 18th century, these spaces of cultural autonomy and support began to worry slaves' white masters. Articles of the 1792 Bando de Buen Gobierno y Policia address the necessity of controlling the cabildos and their members. Neighbors often complained about the unpleasant noises made by the slaves as they sang and played African instruments. By the 19th century, cabildos were re-located outside the walls of the city of Havana so that whites would not have to see or hear their African celebrations. For the Afro-Cubans, this expulsion added a degree of privacy that they had previously lacked.

==The decline of the ''cabildos''==
By the early 19th century cabildos were practically extinct after failed rebellions by the African slaves. There was a revival in their number in the mid-19th century, when they were no longer limited to slaves but welcomed free Afro-Cubans of all walks of life. In 1884, the Cuban government outlawed the Epiphany, a celebration cabildos practiced for more than a century on the 6th of January, which included parading as comparsas down the streets of Havana. In 1887, new laws required cabildos to obtain prior official recognition and licenses. Since slavery had by then been abolished, the authorities sought new means of controlling the free Afro-Cuban population. In 1888 the government forced cabildos to organize as mutual-aid societies following the established laws for white Cuban societies.

==Names and origins of Cabildos==
Slaves were differentiated by their white owners according to their place of origin, with a variety of different names that identified distinct ethnicities from Africa. The names were corruptions of traditional tribal names devised by the slave owners, but they were soon used by the slaves themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Gott, Richard : Cuba a New History. p 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Communist Marxist Party (John)''' is one of the splinter factions of  [[Communist Marxist Party]] led by [[CP John]]. The party is allied with [[United Democratic Front (Kerala)|United Democratic Front]] in [[Kerala]].

The CMP was part of the [[United Democratic Front (India)|United Democratic Front]], an alliance in Kerala which is led by the [[Indian National Congress]]. In March 2014, the party split and the faction led by C. P. John continued in the UDF while the faction led by K. R. Aravindakshan, which had the support of M. V. Raghavan, decided to cooperate with the [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|Left Democratic Front]] although it was not officially inducted into the front.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cmp-splits-one-faction-moves-to-ldf/article5819901.ece "CMP splits, one faction moves to LDF"].

A '''conscience vote''' or '''free vote''' is a type of vote in a [[legislature|legislative body]] where legislators are allowed to vote according to their own personal [[conscience]] rather than according to an official line set down by their [[political party]]. It can also be used to indicate [[crossbencher|crossbench]] members of a [[hung parliament]] where [[confidence and supply]] is provided to allow formation of a [[minority government]] but the right to vote on conscience is retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspg.org.au/pdf/Understanding%20conscience%20vote%20decisions.pdf|publisher=Australian Study of Parliament Group|title=Understanding Conscience Vote Decisions: The Case of the ACT|work=Australian Parliamentary Review|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp20|title=Conscience votes during the Howard Government 1996 - 2007|date=2 February 2009|publisher=Australian Parliament House}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Free votes'' are found in Canadian and some British legislative bodies, ''conscience votes'' in Australian and New Zealand legislative bodies.

In many [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], particularly those that follow the [[parliamentary system]] of government, the elected members of a legislature who belong to a political party are usually required by that party to vote in accordance with the [[party line (politics)|party line]] on significant legislation, on pain of censure or expulsion from the party. Sometimes a particular party member known as the [[whip (politics)|whip]] is responsible for maintaining this [[party discipline]].&lt;ref name="ukparl"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Priddy|first1=Sarah|title=Free votes in the House of Commons since 1997|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04793/SN04793.pdf|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=22 April 2017|format=PDF|date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of a conscience vote, a party declines to dictate an official party line to follow and members may vote as they please. In countries where party discipline is less important and voting against one's party is more common, conscience votes are generally less important.

In most countries, conscience votes are quite rare and are often about issues which are very contentious, or a matter on which the members of any single party differ in their opinions, thus making it difficult for parties to formulate official policies. Usually, a conscience vote will be about religious, moral or ethical issues rather than about administrative or financial ones. Matters such as the [[prohibition|prohibition of alcohol]], [[homosexuality|homosexual]] law reform and the legality of [[prostitution]] are often subject to conscience votes. 

Sometimes a vote may be free for some parties but not for others. For instance, when the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] [[Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage|proposed a motion to re-open the debate on]] Canada's [[same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage laws]], his Conservatives and the opposition [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] declared it a free vote for their members, while the [[Bloc Québécois]] and the [[New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] both maintained party discipline to defeat the measure.

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the [[British House of Commons]] there used to be a conscience vote every few years on the restoration of the [[death penalty]], which had been abolished in 1964 (except for [[treason]], for which it was abolished in 1998 in the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]]). It had always been rejected and this practice has now been abandoned. In Britain, laws concerning [[abortion]] have always been subject to a free vote.

The proposed bans on [[fox hunting|hunting with dogs]] proposed by [[Tony Blair]]'s government were the subject of several free votes in Parliament from 2001.&lt;ref name="ukparl" /&gt; On each occasion the Commons voted for a ban and the [[House of Lords]] rejected it. In 2004 the Government, trying to placate the Lords and other opponents of a ban, proposed only restriction and licensing of hunting but anti-hunting MPs (mostly [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[backbencher]]s) forced through an amendment which would effect a total ban. Seconds after the vote on the amendment, the Government bowed to pressure and agreed to force the ban through the Lords under the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]. It passed in November 2004.

Other decisions which were taken by a free vote include abandoning the experiment with permanent [[daylight saving time|summer time]] and bringing television cameras into Parliament.

== Global use of the conscience vote==
Conscience votes have been held in [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliaments]] on issues of [[Republicanism in Australia|becoming a republic]], [[Abortion in Australia|abortion]], euthanasia, homosexuality, sex discrimination, prostitution, and bioethical issues like assisted reproduction and stem cell research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JCULawRw/2011/5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Zealand Parliament]], conscience votes differ from party votes in that MPs must physically enter a lobby to vote on a motion rather than a party's [[whip (politics)|whip]] calling out the votes on behalf of its MPs. A personal vote can be requested after a contested voice vote by any MP, but whether a personal or party vote is held is at the discretion of the [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker]]. Pieces of legislation which were treated as conscience issues in New Zealand include the [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986]], [[Prostitution Reform Act 2003]], [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007]], [[Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013]] and the present [[End of Life Choice Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/the-house/audio/2018670140/when-mps-go-with-their-gut-what-is-a-conscience-vote |title=When MPs go with their gut: what is a conscience vote? |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=13 November 2018 |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, parties exercise comparatively little control over the votes of individual legislators who are almost always free to vote as they wish. Accordingly, most legislative votes in the United States can be considered free votes, although in rare circumstances a legislator may be disciplined by his or her party for a renegade vote. Such discipline usually occurs only on votes regarding procedural matters on which party unity is expected as a matter of course, rather than substantive matters. For example, Democrat [[James Traficant]] was stripped of his seniority and committee assignments in 2001 when he voted for a Republican, [[Dennis Hastert]], to be [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]]. Because free votes are the norm in the United States, the terms "free vote" and "conscience vote" are generally unused and unknown there.

In [[phonetics]], '''denasalization''' is the loss of nasal airflow in a nasal sound, such as a [[nasal consonant]] or a [[nasal vowel]]. That may be due to [[speech pathology]] but also occurs when the [[paranasal sinus|sinuses]] are blocked from a [[common cold]], when it is called a [[nasal voice]], which is not a linguistic term. The symbol in the [[Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet|Extended IPA]] is {{angle bracket|{{IPA|◌͊}}}}.

When one speaks with a cold, the [[nasal cavity|nasal passages]] still function as a resonant cavity so a denasalized nasal {{IPA|[m͊]}} does not sound like a voiced oral stop {{IPA|[b]}}, and a denasalized vowel {{IPA|[a͊]}} does not sound like an oral vowel {{IPA|[a]}}. 

However, there are cases of historical or allophonic denasalization that have produced oral stops. In some languages with nasal vowels, such as [[Paicĩ language|Paicĩ]], nasal consonants may occur only before nasal vowels; before oral vowels, [[prenasalized stop]]s are found. That allophonic variation is likely to be from a historical process of partial denasalization.

Similarly, several languages around [[Puget Sound]] underwent a process of denasalization about 100 ago. Except in special [[speech register]]s, such as [[baby talk]], the nasals {{IPA|[m, n]}} became the voiced stops {{IPA|[b, d]}}. It appears from historical records that there was an intermediate stage in which the stops were prenasalized stops {{IPA|[ᵐb, ⁿd]}} or poststopped nasals {{IPA|[mᵇ, nᵈ]}}.

Something similar has occurred with word-initial nasals in [[Korean language|Korean]]; in some contexts, {{IPA|/m/, /n/}} are denasalized to {{IPA|[b, d]}}. The process is sometimes represented with the IPA {{IPA|[m͊]}} and {{IPA|[n͊]}}, which simply places the IPA {{IPA|◌͊}} denasalization diacritic on {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[n]}} to show the underlying phoneme.

A '''dream ballet''', in [[musical theater]], is an all-[[dance]], no-[[singing]] [[production number]] that reflects the [[Theme (visual arts)|theme]]s of the production. The [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], themes, and [[fictional character|characters]] are typically the same—although the people playing the characters may be different, as the roles of the dream ballet are usually filled by well trained dancers rather than actual actors.

Dream ballet sequences exist mainly for clarification, foreshadowing, and symbolism, and occur outside the continuity of the production. They also provide the opportunity to impress the audience with advanced dancing techniques and elaborate staging that would otherwise be impossible or [[drama]]tically inappropriate.

The dream ballet is thought to have originated in [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s 1943 musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', which includes an 18-minute first-act dream ballet finale. The technique has since become a routine (although by no means universal) theatrical practice.

[[File:Dribble glass advert.jpg|thumb|An advert for a dribble glass from a 1948 comic book: "Make your drinking friends drool!"]]
A '''dribble glass''' is a drinking glass that has holes hidden in its etched design. 

The purpose of a dribble glass is for [[Practical joke|pranks]]. When a person tilts the glass to take a drink from this glass, they will end up spilling the liquid on their clothing as the drink trickles through the holes.

The dribble glass was invented by [[Soren Sorensen Adams|S.S. Adams]].

}}'''''Engare''''' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] created by Iranian game designer Mahdi Bahrami and soundtracked by Mim Rasouli, playable on [[PC game|PC]] and [[MacOS]]. Describing itself as "a game about motion and geometry", ''Engare''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s design is based upon [[Islamic art]] and [[sacred geometry]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engare.design/|title=Engare|website=www.engare.design|language=en|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game consists of two gameplay modes: a puzzle-solving mode, where the player has to recreate shapes shown onscreen by placing a point on a moving object, akin to a [[Spirograph]] tool, and a free-form art tool allowing the player to design their own patterns. First prototyped in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/07/engare-indie-game-iran-mahdi-bahrami-islamic-art-steam/|title=The surprising Islamic beauty of 'Engare'|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Engare'' was released in October 2017, and retails for $6.99 on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and Bahrami's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/415170/Engare/|title=Engare on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The game's release was delayed by difficulties caused by international [[Sanctions against Iran|sanctions imposed upon Iran]], making it difficult for Bahrami to travel and access resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/what-its-like-to-be-an-iranian-game-creator-in-trumps-america-w463982|title=What It's Like To Be An Iranian Game Creator in Trump's America|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Bahrami has described the influences behind both the game's aesthetics and mechanics. The traditional Islamic geometric patterns featured in the game are widespread in Iran, and particularly in Bahrami's hometown of [[Isfahan]], including the central [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/416579/engare-game-islamic-design/|title=A Puzzle Game Inspired by the Mathematics of Islamic Art|date=2017-12-14|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's mechanic was inspired by a question asked by Bahrami's high-school [[geometry]] teacher, when he asked students to imagine what shape would be traced by a point fixed to a ball when rolled across a flat surface - the result being a series of loops.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/engare-a-videogame-about-the-mathematical-beauty-of-islamic-art/|title=Engare, a videogame about the mathematical beauty of Islamic art - Kill Screen|date=2016-04-01|work=Kill Screen|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahrami explains that even students who did not understand geometry were interested in the answer to this puzzle,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/12/5696024/engare-mahdi-bahrami|title=An Iranian developer's entrancing game about his culture and the mathematics of art|last=Lien|first=Tracey|date=2014-05-12|website=Polygon|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was interested in using ''Engare'' to "explore mathematics in different ways [...] for some people it's easier to explore maths when it's visualised," and that "video games as a medium have great potential [for] these visualisations." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Despite this, Bahrami says, he did not originally set out to make an [[Educational video game|educational game]]. The game is Bahrami's second to be inspired by traditional Islamic patterns, following ''Farsh,'' a game inspired by [[Persian carpet]]s, which his mother wove when he was growing up.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Gameplay ==

''Engare'' has two gameplay modes. The first is a puzzle-solving mode, where the player must recreate a shape shown on-screen by placing a point on a moving object that is drawn into a line as the object moves. As the puzzles become more complex, the player is rewarded with the creation of more and more intricate patterns created from their solution; in later levels these patterns repeat themselves and are coloured in.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/engare-review-spirographs-math-and-islamic-art-blend-for-quite-the-game/|title=Engare review: The geometry of Islamic art becomes a treasure of a game|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; After enough puzzles are solved, a second gameplay mode is unlocked: a pattern [[design tool]] where the player can place dots and lines or colour in tiles to create repeating geometric patterns. These patterns can then be mapped onto a 3-D [[Dome|mosque-like dome]] and explored from different perspectives.

== Reception ==

''Engare'' has been received positively, with a demo version presented at the 2014 [[Game Developers Conference#Experimental Gameplay Workshop|GDC Experimental Gameplay Workshop]] generating positive press coverage.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since its release, ''Engare'' has been praised by Sam Machkovech of ''[[Ars Technica]]'', who describes the game as "[feeling] absolutely magical and unique in the gaming realm," &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and [[Robin Hunicke]] of [[Electronic Arts|EA]] and [[Funomena]], who was "blown away [by] the cleverness of the puzzles".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Rami Ismail of [[Vlambeer]] has praised the game on several occasions, naming it as one of his top 10 games of 2017 in an article for [[Giant Bomb]], and as 'one of the games that he admires the most' in a [[GameSpot]] feature. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/articles/rami-ismails-top-10-games-of-2017/1100-5677/|title=Rami Ismail's top 10 games of 2017|last=Ismail|first=Rami|date=2017-12-26|website=Giant Bomb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-psychonauts-and-other-devs-share-what-games-t/1100-6457827/|title=Nier, Psychonauts, And Other Devs Share What Games They Admire Most|last=|first=|date=2018-03-31|website=GameSpot|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been similarly well-received by players on Steam, where it holds an overall 'very positive' rating, and has won several awards, including the Student Showcase at the [[Independent Games Festival]] and the 'Excellence in Design' and 'Culture Award' categories at the [[Iran Computer and Video Games Foundation#Festivals and Exhibitions|Tehran Video Game Festival]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Adoration des rois mages 1390 Herman von Munster 08947.JPG|thumb|Windows by Hermann von Münster&lt;ref&gt;http://www.persee.fr/doc/bulmo_0007-473x_1969_num_127_1_7094&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Hermann von Münster''' (c. 1330 - March 1392) was a German master glassmaker, native of [[Münster]], in [[Westphalia]], and active in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]].

== Biography ==
Hermman von Münster  is actually the first stained glass artist to be mentioned by the archives of the Cathedral chapter of [[Metz Cathedral|Saint-Etienne]] of Metz. On August 29, 1381, master Hermann received an annuity of 22 [[Livre tournois|pounds]], to pay for its work on the western large window of the cathedral of Metz. His work was supported by Cardinal William Aigrefeuille, legate of the antipope [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]], who then reorganized the Chapter of Metz. Three years later, on 2 May 1384, the Cathedral chapter negotiated the price of the "GRANT OZ", the western [[Rose window]] with Hermann von Munster. Hermann was still working on the windows of the western facade in December 1384. In August 1385, the Cathedral Chapter borrowed 420 pounds to set the work completed.

In 1388, Hermann bought a home in Metz, beside the cathedral, where he died in March 1392. Thanks to his fame and to the excellent quality of his work, Hermann was buried in the aisle of the cathedral. An epitaph on the north wall of the cathedral indicates in [[old French]]:

CI DEVANT GIST&lt;br&gt;
MAISTRE HARMAN LI VALRIER&lt;br&gt;
DE MUNSTERE AN WAILTEFALLE,&lt;br&gt;
ET FIST LE GRANT OZ DE CEANS,&lt;br&gt;
QUI MORUT LE JOR DE LA NOSTRE DAME&lt;br&gt;
EN MARS M.CCC.IIIIXX et XII.&lt;ref&gt;Here, lies the master glassmaker Hermann, from Münster in Westphalia, who made the great rose window there, and died the day of Our Lady, in March 1392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The only information known about Herman von Münster concerns of the [[Metz Cathedral|cathedral of Metz]], in particular the large western window of the nave of Metz.

== Technical overview ==
To [[came glasswork|assemble the window]], pieces of colored and painted glass were first laid out on the design board, with the edges of each piece fitted into H-shaped strips of lead. Then, these [[came]]s were soldered to one another. When a panel was completed, putty was inserted between the glass and the lead cames for waterproofing. The entire composition was then stabilized with an iron armature and mounted in the window.&lt;ref&gt;Stained Glass in Medieval Europe, Thematic Essay, Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stylistic influences ==
It seems that the style of Herman von Münster is to link to the [[Westphalia|Westphalian context]]. His work is close in style to the work of the master of [[Altenberg (Bergisches Land)|Altenberg]], near Münster. But the figures of the master of Altenberg are less expressive, and stricter. The characters in the bottom of the western windows of Metz, richly dressed, stand under colourful architectural niches. The use of thicker glass, with more sustained tones than in France, far from being an archaism, testifies of the influence that the medieval Rhenish style had on his work.

[[Sardar|Sirdar]] '''Ikbal Ali Shah''' ({{lang-hi|सरदार इक़बाल अली शाह}}, {{lang-ur|{{nq|سردار اقبال علی شاہ}}}}, born 1894 in [[Sardhana]], [[India]], died 4 November 1969 in [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]]) was an [[India]]n-[[Afghanistan|Afghan]] author and diplomat descended from the [[Sayyid|Sadaat]] of Paghman. Educated in India, he came to Britain as a young man to continue his education in Edinburgh, where he married a young Scotswoman.

Travelling widely, Ikbal Ali Shah undertook assignments for the British [[Foreign Office]] and became a publicist for a number of Eastern statesmen, penning biographies of [[Kemal Atatürk]], the [[Aga Khan III|Aga Khan]] and others. His other writing includes lighter works such as travel narratives and tales of adventure, as well as more serious works on [[Sufism]], [[Islam]] and Asian politics. He hoped that Sufism might "form a bridge between the Western and the Eastern ways of thinking"; familiar with both cultures, much of his life and writing was devoted to furthering greater cross-cultural understanding.

Ikbal Ali Shah fathered three children, all of whom became notable writers themselves; his son [[Idries Shah]] became particularly well known and acclaimed as a writer and teacher of Sufism in the West. When Ikbal Ali Shah's wife died in 1960, he moved from Britain to [[Morocco]], spending the last decade of his life in [[Tangier]]. He died in a road accident in Morocco, aged 75.

==Life==

===Family origins===
Ikbal Ali Shah was born into a family of Musavi [[Sayyid]]s (descendants of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] through his daughter [[Fatimah]] and also through [[Musa al-Kadhim]], the great-great-grandson of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] and seventh [[Imam]] of the [[Twelver Shi'a]] sect of Islam).&lt;ref name="Elwell14" /&gt; The family originated from [[Paghman]] near [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Elwell14" /&gt; In 1840, Ali Shah's great-grandfather was awarded the title [[Jan-Fishan Khan]] for his support of [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shah Shuja]], a puppet ruler installed by the British.&lt;ref name="Elwell14" /&gt; In 1841, following the defeat of the British, Jan-Fishan Khan was forced to leave Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Elwell14" /&gt; The British-Indian government rewarded his loyalty with an estate in [[Sardhana]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], which thereafter became the family seat.&lt;ref name="Elwell14" /&gt;

Ali Shah's granddaughter [[Saira Shah]] relates that her grandfather "maintained that ancestry was something to try to live up to, not to boast about" and told her that "it is less important who your forebears were than what you yourself become."&lt;ref&gt;[[Saira Shah|Shah, Saira]] (2003).

===Traveller, writer, diplomat and publicist===
In 1918, Ali Shah became only the second Asian to join the [[Royal Society for Asian Affairs]], contributing articles on Islam to the Society's journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=Hugh|author2=Farrington, Susan Maria|title=Strolling about on the Roof of the World: The First Years of the Royal Society for Asian Affairs|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=2002|pages=21, 123}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled widely and became a publicist for a variety of Eastern statesmen such as President [[Kemal Atatürk]] of [[Turkey]], [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah]] of [[Jordan]], King [[Fuad I of Egypt]], the Emir [[Abdul Illah]] of [[Iraq]] and members of the royal family of [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Elwell14" /&gt; He was on friendly terms with both orthodox leaders (like the Rector of [[Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]]) and reformers (like [[Kemal Atatürk]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Shah in his Eastern Context" in ''Sufi Studies: East and West'', edited by Professor L.F.

Ikbal Ali Shah believed that [[Bolshevism]]'s encroachment on the countries of [[Central Asia]] would almost inevitably lead to catastrophic results, and by 1921 was reporting in the [[Edinburgh Review]] on the methods of propaganda and political influence used by the [[Bolshevists]] in Central Asia and [[Afghanistan]], with its consequences for British rule in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W3MAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq=ikbal+ali+shah#v=onepage&amp;q=ikbal%20ali%20shah&amp;f=false Bolshevism in Central Asia]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=September 2012}}

He was also associated with the British [[Foreign Office]] for several decades.&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt; [[James Moore (Cornish author)|James Moore]] states that his work for the Foreign Office occasionally raised controversy: in 1929, after Ali Shah "tried to compromise" the [[British Prime Minister]], [[Ramsay MacDonald]], Foreign Office investigations concluded that there "was hardly a word of truth in his writings".&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt;

Ali Shah was a passionate advocate of the modernisation of Islam.&lt;ref name=Modern /&gt; He viewed this as nothing more and nothing less than a return to genuine Islam, an Islam without a priest class, writing in 1929:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the New Dark Age of my faith, from which we have just emerged into the sunny vistas of real religion, a curious politico-religious system had grown; and it is indeed by reason of our forebears having been seen so long under that influence that the average European wonders whether we have not definitely divorced Islam by our modernization. The truth is that the organization of the Doctors of Moslem Law, backed by autocratic Eastern monarchs was the very antithesis of the words of the Koran. In Turkey, for instance, no man was permitted to consult the Holy Book of Islam and seek interpretation for himself; despite the fact that the only reason for which the faithful places his book above every other Revealed Law is that any man can have his cue directly from it. The Prophet himself emphasized this fact repeatedly and thereby meant to destroy the human tendency of priestcraft. This particular teaching was so deep that it was not until many political cross-currents amongst the Moslem States had much weakened the spiritual essence that the clergy at last won the battle which they had fought for at least a thousand years."&lt;ref name=Modern&gt;"The modernisation of Islam", ''Contemporary Review'', Vol. 135, pp. 263-264; quoted in {{cite book|last=Braden|first=Charles Samuel|title=Modern Tendencies in World Religions|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York|year=1933|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justifying [[Turkey]]'s modernisation efforts under Kemal Atatürk, Ali Shah condemned what Islam had become in Turkey:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Even the slightest divergence from the established church was considered the highest crime; and the faithful wandered in and out of the four water-tight compartments of schools of theology completely dazed by the priest-made dogma that neither would reconcile with the early teachings of Islam nor ring true to the advancing humanity of the present age. The clergy made every effort to circumscribe the view of every Moslim and placed the right of interpretation beyond the reach of even the intelligent seeker after truth."&lt;ref&gt;Sirdar lkbal Ali Shah, "The Religious Revolt of Turkey," ''Review of Religions'', XXVII, No. 7 (July, 1928), 23-26; quoted in: {{cite book|last=Allen|first=Henry Elisha|title=The Turkish Transformation: A Study in Social and Religious Development|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=1935|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He noted with approval that –

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When ecclesiastics frowned upon women parading the streets in Stamboul, the young men were able to silence the objections by quoting the Koran to prove that the Koran enjoined only modesty and not the cruel practice of closing women in the houses."&lt;ref name=Modern /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1930s he was in Geneva, working in collaboration with the [[League of Nations]] supporting [[disarmament]],&lt;ref name="Sufi Studies 1974, p. 180"&gt;"Sufism in the Art of Idries Shah" in ''Sufi Studies: East and West'', edited by Professor L.F.

Ikbal Ali Shah was also a member of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the [[Royal Asiatic Society]].&lt;ref name="Sufi Studies 1974, p. 180"/&gt; By contributing to the work of such organisations, he aimed to bridge the gap between east and west. In 1937, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... since my early days I have striven to interpret the East to the West, and Europe to Asia. Through this, I believe, lies the way of mutual sympathy between the nations; and such can only be accomplished by means of reading the effusions of one another's Great Minds; because if we but endeavour to understand about our fellow men, good will can come as the gentle dawn of peace."&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Sirdar Ikbal Ali (1975). ''The Book of Oriental Literature''. Octagon Press Ltd. p. vii. {{ISBN|978-0-900860-43-0}}. Originally published 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1940, the family moved from London to Oxford to escape German bombing.&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt; In 1945, Ali Shah and his son Idries travelled to [[Uruguay]] as expert advisors on ''[[halal]]led'' meat questions for the [[India Office]]; a scandal resulted, leading the British [[ambassador]] to describe him as a "swindler".&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt;

===Latter years===
Ikbal Ali Shah later taught Sufi "classes" in England, which were the precursors to the Sufi school established by his son, Idries Shah. He was also appointed by Dr. [[Zakir Hussain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]] as India's cultural representative in all of West Asia.&lt;ref name="Sufi Studies 1974, p. 180"/&gt;

According to his grandson [[Tahir Shah|Tahir]], Ali Shah was heartbroken when his wife died in 1960, aged 59; feeling unable to continue living in the places in which they had shared their lives, he moved to [[Tangier]] in [[Morocco]], a place they had never visited together, and lived there in a small villa close to the seafront.&lt;ref name=TCH7&gt;{{cite book

Rushbrook Williams, E.P.Dutton &amp; Co., 1974, pp. 16, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of his life, Ali Shah was caught up in the controversy surrounding the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam#Robert Graves and Omar Ali-Shah|1967 publication of a new translation]] of [[Omar Khayyam]]'s [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]] by his son [[Omar Ali-Shah]] and the English poet [[Robert Graves]].&lt;ref name="Graves" /&gt; The translation was based on an annotated "crib" made by Omar Ali-Shah, who asserted that it derived from an old manuscript said to have been in the Shah family's possession for 800 years.&lt;ref name="eagle"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844564,00.html Stuffed Eagle], ''[[Time magazine]]'', 31 May 1968  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624152418/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C844564%2C00.html |date=24 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L.

Richard Perceval Graves describes how, in a letter to Robert Graves in 1970, Idries Shah pointed out that "production of the MSS would prove nothing, because there would be no way of telling whether it was original, or whether someone had washed the writing from a piece of ancient parchment, and then applied a new text using inert inks." Shah believed that the critics were "intent only on opposition" and said he agreed with his father, who had been so infuriated by the "hyaenas" that he wanted nothing to do with the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' of Saturday, November 8, 1969 stated:

{{quotation|Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah died on Tuesday in a motor accident in Morocco.

==Writings==

In keeping with his theme of interpreting the East to the West, Ikbal Ali Shah authored travel narratives of his adventures in Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, such as ''Alone in Arabian Nights'' (1933), and set up fiction-writing workshops to disseminate Eastern stories and tales in books like ''Fifty Enthralling Stories of the Mysterious East'' (1937).&lt;ref&gt;Hayter, Augy. (2002) ''Fictions and Factions''. Tractus Books, p. 258. {{ISBN|978-2-909347-14-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote biographies of major leaders in the Islamic World, such as ''Kemal: Maker of Modern Turkey'' (1934) and ''Controlling Minds of Asia'' (1937), as well as anthropological, historical and political works like ''Afghanistan of the Afghans'' (1928), ''Pakistan: A Plan for India'' (1944) and ''Vietnam'' (1960).

Many of his works were anthologies of literature from the East, such as ''The Book of Oriental Literature'' (1937) and ''Oriental Caravan'' (1933), while other works sought to elucidate Eastern religious and mystical traditions, with an emphasis on Sufism, as in ''Spirit of the East'' (1939), ''Lights of Asia'' (1937), and ''Islamic Sufism'' (1933). He also authored books specifically on Islam, like ''Mohammed: The Prophet'' (1932) and ''Selections from the Koran'' (1933). [[Octagon Press]] published compilations of his tales and adventures in the books ''Escape From Central Asia'' (1980) and ''The Golden Caravan'' (1983). The latter two books also include selections from the Sirdar's writings which had previously been published under the names Sheikh Ahmed Abdullah, Rustam Khan-Urf, Bahloal Dana and Ibn Amjed.

Altogether, Ikbal Ali Shah was author of more than fifty books, including:
* ''Eastern Moonbeams'' (1918)
* ''Briton in India'' (1918)
* ''Afghanistan of the Afghans'' (1927)
* ''Westward to Mecca'' (1928)
* ''Eastward to Persia'' (1930)
* ''The Golden East'' (1931)
* ''Arabia'' (1931)

* ''The Golden Caravan'' (1983)

According to his grandson [[Tahir Shah]], the Sirdar also published ''Through the Garden of Allah'' (1938) under the pseudonym of John Grant. A revised edition entitled ''Travels in the Unknown East'' was published by Octagon Press in 1992.

==Sufism==

According to his long-time friend [[L. F. Rushbrook Williams]], Ikbal Ali Shah believed that the Sufi message "might form a bridge between the Western and the Eastern ways of thinking, and that the methods that [the Sufis] were using to convey it— methods well-tested by centuries of successful practice— would certainly be of interest and might be of value to the Western world in the quest for the best ways of promoting independent thought and the re-examination of accepted values to test their suitability to the needs of modern social organization."&lt;ref&gt;"Shah in his Eastern Context" in ''Sufi Studies: East and West'', edited by Professor L.F. Rushbrook Williams, E.P.Dutton &amp; Co., 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Islamic Sufism'', Ikbal Ali Shah stated that he was instructed in the Sufi Way by his father, to whom he referred as "that Fountain of Goodness Hadrat Syedna Nawab Amjed Ali Shah Naqshbandi Paghmani". He said that the Nawab had, in turn, been taught by his father Nawab Mohammed Ali Shah, who is buried in the Delhi shrine of the Naqshbandi Khwaja [[Baqi Billah]]&lt;ref&gt;"Shah: Knowledge, Technique, Influence" in Williams, L.F. Rushbrook (1974). ''Sufi Studies: East and West''. E.P.Dutton &amp; Co. p. 236. {{ISBN|978-0-525-47368-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (and an extract from whose ''Nishan-i-Ghaib'', Signs of the Unseen, is given in the "Letters and Lectures" section of Idries Shah's ''The Way of the Sufi''). Nawab Mohammed Ali Shah's father was [[Jan-Fishan Khan]], who in turn had been a disciple of the celebrated Naqshbandi master [[Haji Dost Muhammad Qandhari]]. Ikbal Ali Shah sets out the remainder of this [[silsila]], from Qandhari backwards to Yaqub Charkhi (the disciple of Bahauddin Naqshband) in ''Islamic Sufism'' (where it is described as "The Punjab Tradition").

In addition to his father Ikbal Ali Shah also gives credit, in his introduction to "Islamic Sufism", to 'the earlier discourses of Sheikh al Akbar Hadratna Shah Abdul [sic] Khair Mujaddadi'. Shah Abul Khair Naqshbandi Dihlawi (1855-1922) was the successor of Shah Muhammad Umar Mujaddidi, who in turn was the son of Ahmad Saeed Mujaddidi Fārūqi Dehlavi, the teacher of Haji Dost Qandhari. Abul Khair took over responsibility for the 'Delhi house' - the dargah and burial place of Mirza Mazhar Jan-i-Janaan and Ghulam Ali Dihlawi by the Turkmen Gate of the old city of Delhi - from Haji Dost Qandhari's deputy Rahim Bakhsh Ajmeri, and today it bears his name. It seems most likely that Ikbal Ali Shah attended Abul Khair's assemblies in person, prior to his coming to Edinburgh, thus linking his Sufi teaching (and, by extension, that of his sons) directly into the main line of the Naqshbandiyya Mujaddidiya.

Ikbal Ali Shah introduced this tradition of Sufism in the West, with special reference to the controversial metaphors in Sufi poetry, in an article published in Hibbert Journal (1921–1922) entitled ''The General Principles of Sufism''.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert Journal 20 (1921-1922) pp524-35; a revised reprint in Idries Shah (1990). ''Sufi Thought and Action—an Anthology'', Octagon Press. {{ISBN|978-0-86304-051-1}}. The article was later integrated as Chapter XI: 'The Afghan conception of Sufism' in Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah (1927). ''Afghanistan of the Afghans''. {{ISBN|978-81-86505-26-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four consecutive stages of spiritual advancement were indicated there: Nasut—Humanity; Tariqa—the Way; Jabarut (Araff)—Power, and Haqiqa—Truth, corresponding to the four stages in Naqshbandi practice as observed by the Shattari Pir Shah [[Muhammad Ghawth]] (died 1563).&lt;ref name="TheSufis367"&gt;{{cite book

In his more substantial introduction&lt;ref&gt;Professor [[Hossein Nasr|Sayyed Hossein Nasr]] described ''Islamic Sufism'' as : "A discussion of Sufism by a contemporary Sufi although some of the references made to Western concepts and ideas are inacurate and many misleading for a Westerner not already acquainted with Sufism" in ''Ideals and Realities of Islam'' {{ISBN|978-1-85538-409-5}} Aquarian/HarperCollins 1994, first published 1966 pg 145&lt;/ref&gt; ''Islamic Sufism'' (1933), Ali-Shah includes excerpts from the work of Khaja Khan attributing the discovery of this system (''[[Lataif-e-sitta|Latayifi Sitta]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Lataif-e-Sitta]] refers to the five subtle organs (Lataif-e-Khamsa—as described) plus the Self ([[Nafs]]) which although not counted as a subtle organ (it is a composite of these organs in ever changing stages and states) has been given a 'location' in the mnemonic schema projected on the human body.

In the preface to ''Islamic Sufism'', the Sirdar presents his views on how and why Sufism can be a way for modern humanity to reconnect with its spiritual heritage. Deploring the current state of the world, he notes that it is in such times that new revivals of spiritual thought often take place, guided by great exemplars who make a significant impact on society. Focusing on Sufism, he points out that the Sufi way is open to all people and that it can be followed in any society while maintaining contact with the world, regardless of the prevailing materialism. The student's work is done through ordinary life in human society: ''Be in the world, but not if it'' is the Sufi dictum.  The Sufi encourages not only personal refinement, but the uplifting of others as part of working towards a 'universal brotherhood' of humanity."&lt;ref name="Shah, Sirdar Ikbal Ali 2000"&gt;Shah, Sirdar Ikbal Ali (2000). Islamic Sufism. Tractus Books. {{ISBN|978-2-909347-07-3}}.  First published 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

As examples of practical methods of Sufism which can be of use in the modern world, the Sirdar discusses meditation, the giving of charity, and focusing more on durable truths and realities than on transient and illusory pursuits. He also discusses the relationship between Sufism and the mind-body connection in healing. He asserts that, through Sufism, "our latent forces for good can be increased, as well as our creative productivity."&lt;ref name="Shah, Sirdar Ikbal Ali 2000"/&gt;

''Islamic Sufism'' contains Sufi interpretations of Islamic beliefs and practices, explanations of the history and theory of Sufism with reference to similar Western ideas, selections from the work of the great Sufis of the past, like [[Al-Ghazali]], [[Rumi]], [[al-Hujwiri]], [[Jami]], [[Hafez]] and others, as well as examples of the thought of contemporary visionaries like [[Muhammad Iqbal]].&lt;ref name="Shah, Sirdar Ikbal Ali 2000"/&gt;

In the revised edition of ''Alone In Arabian Nights'', Ikbal Ali Shah had this to say about Sufism:

In contemporary terms, the Sufis can be seen as people who, initially, work against the evils of coercive organized religion and restrictive cults; then try to help expand the understanding of those who are interested: strictly according to the potential of the people and the times... This latter contention is.. unacceptable to the vast majority of people, who cannot feel happy with it at all... because they always need the reassurance of tradition and of the familiar. If they don't know what to reject, they may deify it.&lt;ref name="Shah, Sirdar Ikbal Ali 1992 p. 212-215"&gt;Shah, Sirdar Ikbal Ali (1992). ''Alone in Arabian Nights''. Octagon Press Ltd, London. p. 212-215. {{ISBN|978-0-86304-063-4}}. Originally published 1933; revised 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He adds that his travelling was done, in part, to carry out missions connected with Sufism, and he describes his attempts to explain to groups in the East and the West that what they imagined to be Sufism was highly inaccurate. As examples, he points out that, according to Sufi experience, random collections of people, indulgence in most of the popular mystical practices of physical and emotional excitement, and amalgamations of all kinds of Eastern ideas without regard for what is useful under prevailing circumstances, would usually not result in real Sufi developments. These explanations and admonitions, while intriguing to some, were often rejected by groups that felt threatened by them.&lt;ref name="Shah, Sirdar Ikbal Ali 1992 p. 212-215"/&gt;

Rushbrook Williams affirms that Ikbal Ali Shah's more public work and activities, such as writing travel books and biographies of major figures, was only a byproduct of his determination to study and promote the value of Sufism as a link between Eastern and Western thought.&lt;ref&gt;"Shah in his Eastern Context" in Sufi Studies: East and West, edited by Professor L.F. Rushbrook Williams, E.P.Dutton &amp; Co., 1974, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Ikbal Ali Shah's writings and work received mixed reviews and responses.

''Westward to Mecca'' (1928) was described by noted Orientalist [[H.A.R. Gibb]] in the ''Journal of the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]]'' as a "well-spiced Eastern review, featuring Afghan raiders, alchemists, enchanted walls, watery blue-eyed Bolshevists, singing dervishes and mysterious caves, relieved by more common-place political and literary interludes. Is it all true? How like the materially-minded West to ask such questions!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibb|first=H. A. R.|title=Review of ''Westward to Mecca''|journal=Journal of the Royal Institute of International Affairs|publisher=Blackwell|volume=8|issue=1|pages=71–72|jstor=3015017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the [[Aga Khan III]] penned a foreword to Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah's book ''Eastward To Persia'', stating that he thought "Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah's books—and especially this latest book on Persia—should be read by those in the West who want to see the East through Oriental eyes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?client=firefox-a&amp;id=qmkxAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Shah+%22Eastward+to+Persia%22&amp;q=Oriental+eyes#search_anchor Eastward to Persia], p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in the ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', ''The Golden East'' (1931) was criticised for its imperfect command of English, its "tedium heightened by the Sirdar's efforts at wit, by his imaginary yet dull stories of adventure", and for the many incorrect renderings of Persian words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=M. L. F.|date=Jan 1932|title=Review of ''The Golden East.'' By Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah. 9x6, pp. 288, 36 pis.

In his introduction to the 1939 edition of Ikbal Ali Shah's book, ''Alone In Arabian Nights'', Sir [[Edward Denison Ross]] stated that while the Sirdar, well known to him for many years, was "tremendously modest about his achievements", he considered him "the greatest contemporary writer and traveller of the East". He referred to the book as "fascinating" and "extraordinary", commenting on its "erudition, scope and range" and declaring that the Sirdar wrote "the most excellently idiomatic English".&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Sirdar Ikbal Ali (1992). Alone in Arabian Nights. Octagon Press Ltd, London. p. vii. {{ISBN|978-0-86304-063-4}}. Originally published 1933; revised 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Viet Nam'' (Octagon Press, 1960) fared worse; a reviewer in the ''Journal of the Royal Institute of International Affairs'' accused the book of "numerous elementary errors" and questioned whether Ali Shah had ever visited the country he was describing, or had mostly just drawn on official anti-[[Communist]] government propaganda.&lt;ref name="Vietnam"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Honey|first=P. J.|date=Apr 1961|title=Review of ''Viet Nam''|journal=International Affairs|publisher=Blackwell|volume=37|issue=2|pages=265–266|jstor=2611932|doi=10.2307/2611932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summing up, the reviewer concluded: "This book is heavily biased, meretricious, frequently inaccurate, and badly written. It cannot be recommended."&lt;ref name="Vietnam" /&gt; A review in the 1962 ''Year Book of World Affairs'' similarly described the book as "highly confused and unreliable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Keeton |editor-first=George Williams |title=Year Book of World Affairs |publisher=Stevens |year=1962 |page=808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of [[Idries Shah]]'s work generated renewed interest in his father. Asked about his recently-deceased father in a 1970 [[BBC]] interview, Idries Shah agreed that Ikbal Ali Shah was "very unusual". Although he did make some enemies, Shah found it remarkable how few they were, given how uncategorizable and unusual he was. People often remarked to Shah that "the trouble is we never quite knew which side your father was on", to which Shah responded, "I'm sure it never occurred to him that he had to be on any side." Shah described him as "rather a mild sort of person in manner and appearance" but capable of behaving like an "unpredictable Oriental" who often did "unexpected" and "surprising" things when it was required by circumstances. He had a wide range of information and activity but much of it was compartmentalized so that few people knew everything, and no biography had ever been written.&lt;ref name="BBCRadioInterview"&gt;{{cite web

Aref Tamer, an Ismaili Syrian author and scholar of Islamic culture, pointed out in 1973 that "Very little has been written about Saiyid Ikbal Ali Shah... not all [historians] have been able to descry the underlying unity, the service of the community, and the view of the ultimate good that was found in him," because outside observers did not have the perspective to see the pattern.&lt;ref&gt;"Sufism in the Art of Idries Shah"  in ''Sufi Studies: East and West'', edited by Professor L.F. Rushbrook Williams, E.P.Dutton &amp; Co., 1974, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor [[L. F. Rushbrook Williams]], the editor of a work published in honor of the services to sufi studies of Ikbal Ali Shah's son Idries, "Sirdar Ikbal and his son [Idries Shah], both in writing and in other ways, were ultimately to show how Sufi thought and action, educational and adaptive as they are, could be of service to contemporary thinking" and he concluded in 1973 that "... whereas Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah, who pioneered the effective study of Sufi philosophy in the West, found that the time was not quite ripe for his message to be appreciated at its true value, Idries Shah has discovered that in this age of spiritual uncertainty and a dawning reaction against the prevalent materialism, the outlook and practices of Sufism are meeting exactly the needs that so many people are now experiencing."&lt;ref&gt;"Shah in his Eastern Context" in ''Sufi Studies: East and West'', edited by Professor L.F. Rushbrook Williams, E.P.Dutton &amp; Co., 1974, p. 19; 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edinburgh orientalist L. P. Elwell-Sutton considered many of the claims made in Rushbrook Williams' book on behalf of Ikbal Ali Shah and his son Idries, concerning their representing the Sufi tradition, to be self-serving publicity, filled with "sycophantic phraseology, fawning adulation, and disarming disregard for facts."&lt;ref name="RWreview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elwell-Sutton|first=L.

Beginning in the 1970s, the [[Octagon Press]], as part of its aim to establish "the historical and cultural context" for Idries Shah's Sufi work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et?ac=001301712421770&amp;rtmo=qMuJX999&amp;atmo=99999999&amp;pg=%2Fet%2F96%2F12%2F7%2Febshah07.html |title=The Daily Telegraph, 7 Dec 1996 |accessdate=2008-10-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000525070609/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et?ac=001301712421770&amp;rtmo=qMuJX999&amp;atmo=99999999&amp;pg=%2Fet%2F96%2F12%2F7%2Febshah07.html |archivedate=25 May 2000 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; began re-issuing several of Ikbal Ali Shah's books, among them ''The Book of Oriental Literature'' in 1976, a 400-page anthology containing extracts from important mystical and secular literature from all over the East, including excerpts from several classical Sufi authors.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Sirdar Ikbal Ali (1975). ''The Book of Oriental Literature''. Octagon Press Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0-900860-43-0}}. Originally published 1937&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the reprint in the [[University of Oklahoma]] ''Books Abroad'' journal wondered why the book had been reprinted, since it no longer appeared to meet contemporary standards; the amount of space given to various national literatures appeared very uneven, the section on Arabia lacked many essential authors, and the section on Japan, consisting of just two pages, failed to give the names of the writers whose poems were featured.&lt;ref name="DJD"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson-Davie|first=D.|date=Autumn 1976|title=Review of ''The Book of Oriental Literature''|journal=Books Abroad|publisher=University of Oklahoma|volume=50|issue=4|page=966|jstor=40131300|doi=10.2307/40131300}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an anthology, it was considered woefully inadequate.&lt;ref name="DJD" /&gt;

In 1986, James Moore researched Foreign Office records on Ikbal Ali Shah for a paper critical of his son Idries, and claimed to have found that "damaging material on Ikbal abounds throughout FO 371 and FO 395 from 1926 to 1950"; he came to the conclusion that Ikbal Ali Shah had been "charming and personable" but an inveterate teller of tall stories, a condition Moore chose to describe as "Munchhausen's syndrome".&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt;

The ''[[Contemporary Review]]'', discussing the 1992 re-issue of ''Alone in Arabian Nights'', observed that it stressed "the eternal attitudes to fate, love and death".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120714180231/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2242/is_n1528_v262/ai_14153846/ Contemporary Review, May, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=September 2012}}

More recently, ''Afghanistan of the Afghans'' (1927) was included in [[The Kite Runner]] Companion Curriculum, published by [[Amnesty International USA]], as part of a list of books recommended for further reading by the [[Afghanistan Relief Organization]].&lt;ref name="KiteRunner"&gt;{{cite web

'''Immigration to the United States''' is the [[international]] movement of non-[[national of the United State|U.S. nationals]] in order to reside permanently in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|8|1101|a|22}} ("The term 'national of the United States' means (A) a citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.")&lt;/ref&gt; Lawful [[immigration]] has been a major source of [[population growth]] and cultural change throughout much of the U.S. history. Because the United States is a [[settler colonialism|settler colonial society]], all [[Americans]], with the exception of the small percent of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], can trace their ancestry to immigrants from other nations around the world.

In absolute numbers, the United States has a larger immigrant population than any other country, with 47 million immigrants as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates15.shtml|title=United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|access-date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents 19.1% of the 244 million international migrants worldwide, and 14.4% of the U.S. population. Some other countries have larger proportions of immigrants, such as [[Immigration to Switzerland|Switzerland with 24.9%]] and [[Immigration to Canada|Canada with 21.9%]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/infografik-auslaender-in-zahlen-id7040362.html|title=Ausländer in Zahlen|publisher=[[Blick]]|access-date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171025/dq171025b-eng.htm|title=The Daily — Immigration and ethnocultural diversity: Key results from the 2016 Census|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www150.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2016 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, the United States admitted 1.18 million legal immigrants in 2016.&lt;ref name="2016Yearbook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Table 7. Persons Obtaining Lawful Permanent Resident Status By Type And Detailed Class Of Admission: Fiscal Year 2016 — 2016 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics |url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2016/table7 |website=DHS.gov |publisher=[[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) |accessdate=23 June 2018 |date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 20% were family-sponsored, 47% were the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, 12% were employment-based preferences, 4% were part of the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa]] program, and 13% were [[refugee]]s and/or [[asylum seeker]]s.&lt;ref name="2016Yearbook"/&gt; The remainder included small numbers from several other categories, including those who were granted the [[Special Immigrant Visa]] (SIV); persons admitted under the [[Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act]]; children born subsequent to the issuance of a parent's visa; and certain [[parole]]es from the former Soviet Union, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam who were denied refugee status.&lt;ref name="2016Yearbook"/&gt;

The economic, social, and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding such issues as maintaining [[American ethnicity|ethnic homogeneity]], workers for employers versus jobs for non-immigrants, settlement patterns, impact on upward [[socioeconomic mobility in the United States|social mobility]], [[Crime in the United States|crime]], and voting behavior.

Prior to 1965, policies such as the [[National Origins Formula|national origins formula]] limited immigration and [[naturalization]] opportunities for people from areas outside [[Western Europe]]. Exclusion laws enacted as early as the 1880s generally prohibited or severely restricted immigration from Asia, and quota laws enacted in the 1920s curtailed Eastern European immigration. The [[civil rights movement]] led to the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|replacement]]&lt;ref name="american-gatekeeping" /&gt; of these ethnic quotas with per-country limits.&lt;ref name="per-country"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary/country-limit|title=Per Country Limit|publisher=[[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121232201/http://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary/country-limit|archivedate=January 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}} in 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the number of first-generation immigrants living in the United States has quadrupled.&lt;ref name="migrationinformation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="google1" /&gt;

Research suggests that immigration to the United States is beneficial to the U.S. economy. With few exceptions, the evidence suggests that on average, immigration has positive economic effects on the native population, but it is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives. Studies also show that immigrants have lower crime rates than natives in the United States.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2015|title=The Integration of Immigrants into American Society|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/21746/chapter/9#326|journal=|language=en|publisher=National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|volume=|pages=|doi=10.17226/21746|quote=Americans have long believed that immigrants are more likely than natives to commit crimes and that rising immigration leads to rising crime ...

==History==
{{Main|History of immigration to the United States}}
[[File:Welcome to the land of freedom.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Immigrants on ocean steamer passing the Statue of Liberty, New York City, 1887]]
American immigration history can be viewed in four epochs: the colonial period, the mid-19th century, the start of the 20th century, and post-1965. Each period brought distinct national groups, races and ethnicities to the United States. During the 17th century, approximately 400,000 English people migrated to Colonial America.&lt;ref name="virtualjamestown"/&gt; However, only half stayed permanently. From 1700 to 1775 between 400-500,000 immigrated. Only 45,000 English supposedly immigrated in the period 1701 to 1775 (on Butler, Becoming America, The Revolution before 1776, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;34-35 {{ISBN|0-674-00091-9}}), a figure questioned as too low (The Oxford History of the British Empire, The Eighteenth Century, Ed. P. J. Marshall, p.&amp;nbsp;3 {{ISBN|0-19-820563-5}} the number  given is at 80,000 less 29,000 Welsh which seems strange to the author, James Horn; Duncan also regards this as a "mystery") not including the 50,000-120,000 convicts transported, most of whom were English: the rest, 400-450,000 were Scots, Scots-Irish from Ulster, Germans and Swiss, French Huguenots, and involuntarily 350,000 Africans (Encyclopedia of the Colonial and Revolutionary America, 1996 p.&amp;nbsp;200-202 {{ISBN|0-306-80687-8}}; Jon Butler, Becoming America, The Revolution before 1776, 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;16–49 {{ISBN|0-674-00091-9}}). Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America during the 17th and 18th centuries arrived as [[indentured servant]]s.&lt;ref name="mertsahinoglu" /&gt; They numbered 350,000 (Encyclopedia, p.&amp;nbsp;202). The European populations of the Middle Colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware were ethnically very mixed, the English constituting only 30 in Pennsylvania, 40% in New Jersey to 45% in New York (numbered22 thousand or 18% in NY) (Duncan. op. cit. p.&amp;nbsp;10). The mid-19th century saw an influx mainly from northern Europe from the same major ethnic groups as for the Colonial Period but with large numbers of Catholic Irish and Scandinavians added to the mix; the late 19th and early 20th-century immigrants were mainly from Southern and Eastern Europe, but there were also several million immigrants from Canada; post-1965 most came from Latin America and Asia.

Historians estimate that fewer than 1 million immigrants moved to the United States from Europe between 1600 and 1799.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; By comparison, in the first federal census, in 1790, the population of the United States was enumerated to be 3,929,214.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/fast_facts/1790_fast_facts.html |title=History: 1790 Fast Facts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Naturalization Act of 1790|1790 Act]] limited naturalization to "free white persons"; it was expanded to include blacks in the 1860s and Asians in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics: African Americans and Asian Americans"/&gt; In the early years of the United States, immigration was fewer than 8,000 people a year,&lt;ref name="americanheritage"/&gt; including French refugees from the slave revolt in Haiti. After 1820, immigration gradually increased. From 1836 to 1914, over 30 million Europeans migrated to the United States.&lt;ref name="tandfonline"/&gt; The death rate on these transatlantic voyages was high, during which one in seven travelers died.&lt;ref name="Dying and Death in Canada"/&gt; In 1875, the nation passed its first immigration law, the [[Page Act of 1875]].&lt;ref name="The real immigration scare tactics"/&gt;
[[File:Ellis island 1902.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Immigrants arriving at [[Ellis Island]], 1902]]
After an initial wave of immigration from China following the [[California Gold Rush]], Congress passed a series of laws culminating in the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, banning virtually all immigration from China until the law's repeal in 1943. In the late 1800s, [[Asian immigration to the United States#First major wave of Asian immigration (1850s-1917)|immigration from other Asian countries]], especially to the West Coast, became more common.

The peak year of European immigration was in 1907, when 1,285,349 persons entered the country.&lt;ref name="houstonhistory"/&gt; By 1910, 13.5 million immigrants were living in the United States.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; In 1921, the Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]], followed by the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. The 1924 Act was aimed at further restricting immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, particularly Jews, Italians, and Slavs, who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s, and consolidated the prohibition of [[Asian immigration to the United States|Asian immigration]].&lt;ref name="nwsource"/&gt;

Immigration patterns of the 1930s were affected by the [[Great Depression]].

The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], also known as the Hart-Cellar Act, abolished the system of national-origin quotas. By equalizing immigration policies, the act resulted in new immigration from non-European nations, which changed [[Demographics of the United States|the ethnic make-up of the United States]].&lt;ref name="globe obama" /&gt; In 1970, 60% of immigrants were from Europe; this decreased to 15% by 2000.&lt;ref name="google4"/&gt; In 1990, [[George H.

In November 1994, California voters passed [[Proposition 187]] amending the state constitution, denying state financial aid to illegal immigrants.

Until the 1930s most legal immigrants were male. By the 1990s women accounted for just over half of all legal immigrants.&lt;ref name="nap"/&gt; Contemporary immigrants tend to be younger than the native population of the United States, with people between the ages of 15 and 34 substantially overrepresented.&lt;ref name="nap9"/&gt; Immigrants are also more likely to be married and less likely to be divorced than native-born Americans of the same age.&lt;ref name="nap10"/&gt;
[[File:Iftar in Patterson New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.95|[[Paterson, New Jersey]], within the [[New York City Metropolitan Area]], is becoming an increasingly popular destination for [[Islam in the United States|Muslim]] immigrants.]]
Immigrants are likely to move to and live in areas populated by people with similar backgrounds. This phenomenon has held true throughout the history of immigration to the United States.&lt;ref name="nap11"/&gt; Seven out of ten immigrants surveyed by [[Public Agenda]] in 2009 said they intended to make the U.S. their permanent home, and 71% said if they could do it over again they would still come to the US. In the same study, 76% of immigrants say the government has become stricter on enforcing immigration laws since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] ("9/11"), and 24% report that they personally have experienced some or a great deal of discrimination.&lt;ref name="publicagenda"/&gt;

Public attitudes about immigration in the U.S. were heavily influenced in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. After the attacks, 52% of Americans believed that immigration was a good thing overall for the U.S., down from 62% the year before, according to a 2009 Gallup poll.&lt;ref name="gallup"/&gt; A 2008 Public Agenda survey found that half of Americans said tighter controls on immigration would do "a great deal" to enhance U.S. national security.&lt;ref name="publicagenda12"/&gt; Harvard political scientist and historian [[Samuel P.

The United States admitted more legal immigrants from 1991 to 2000, between ten and eleven million, than in any previous decade. In the most recent decade, the ten million legal immigrants that settled in the U.S. represent an annual growth of only about 0.3% as the U.S. population grew from 249 million to 281 million. By comparison, the highest previous decade was the 1900s, when 8.8 million people arrived, increasing the total U.S. population by one percent every year. Specifically, "nearly 15% of Americans were foreign-born in 1910, while in 1999, only about 10% were foreign-born."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

By 1970, immigrants accounted for 4.7 percent of the US population and rising to 6.2 percent in 1980, with an estimated 12.5 percent in 2009.&lt;ref name="migrationinformation14"/&gt; {{As of|2010}}, 25% of US residents under age 18 were first- or second-generation immigrants.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Eight percent of all babies born in the U.S. in 2008 belonged to illegal immigrant parents, according to a recent analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the Pew Hispanic Center.&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt;

Legal immigration to the U.S. increased from 250,000 in the 1930s, to 2.5 million in the 1950s, to 4.5 million in the 1970s, and to 7.3 million in the 1980s, before resting at about 10 million in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="findarticles"/&gt; Since 2000, legal immigrants to the United States number approximately 1,000,000 per year, of whom about 600,000 are ''Change of Status'' who already are in the U.S. Legal immigrants to the United States now are at their highest level ever, at just over 37,000,000 legal immigrants. Illegal immigration may be as high as 1,500,000 per year with a net of at least 700,000 illegal immigrants arriving every year.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pewhispanic"/&gt; Immigration led to a 57.4% increase in foreign born population from 1990 to 2000.&lt;ref name="migrationinformation15"/&gt;

While immigration has increased drastically over the last century, the foreign born share of the population is, at 13.4, only somewhat below what it was at its peak in 1910 at 14.7%. A number of factors may be attributed to the decrease in the representation of foreign born residents in the United States. Most significant has been the change in the composition of immigrants; prior to 1890, 82% of immigrants came from North and Western Europe. From 1891 to 1920, that number dropped to 25%, with a rise in immigrants from East, Central, and South Europe, summing up to 64%. Animosity towards these different and foreign immigrants rose in the United States, resulting in much legislation to limit immigration.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Contemporary immigrants settle predominantly in seven states, [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Florida]], [[Texas]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Illinois]], comprising about 44% of the U.S. population as a whole. The combined total immigrant population of these seven states was 70% of the total foreign-born population in 2000.

The [[Asian American|Asian]] population is expected to nearly double in 2060.&lt;ref name="Census2015"/&gt; Overall, the Pew Report predicts the population of the United States will rise from 296 million in 2005 to 441 million in 2065, but only to 338 million with no immigration.&lt;ref name="Pew2015"/&gt;

In 35 of the country's [[List of the largest metropolitan areas in the Americas|50 largest cities]], non-Hispanic whites were at the last census or are predicted to be in the minority.&lt;ref name="Changing Face of Western Cities"/&gt; In California, non-Hispanic whites slipped from 80% of the state's population in 1970 to 42% in 2001&lt;ref name="cbsnews18"/&gt; and 39% in 2013.&lt;ref name="California QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau:"/&gt;

Immigrant segregation declined in the first half of the 20th century, but has been rising over the past few decades. This has caused questioning of the correctness of describing the United States as a [[melting pot]]. One explanation is that groups with lower socioeconomic status concentrate in more densely populated area that have access to [[public transit]] while groups with higher socioeconomic status move to [[suburban]] areas. Another is that some recent immigrant groups are more culturally and linguistically different from earlier groups and prefer to live together due to factors such as communication costs.&lt;ref name="segregation"/&gt; Another explanation for increased segregation is [[white flight]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Whereas the impact on the average native tends to be small and positive, studies show more mixed results for low-skilled natives, but whether the effects are positive or negative, they tend to be small either way.&lt;ref&gt;

Immigrants may often do types of work that natives are largely unwilling to do, contributing to greater economic prosperity for the economy as a whole: for instance, Mexican migrant workers taking up manual farm work in the United States has close to zero effect on native employment in that occupation, which means that the effect of Mexican workers on U.S. employment outside farm work was therefore most likely positive, since they raised overall economic productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=10492|title=IZA – Institute for the Study of Labor|website=legacy.iza.org|access-date=February 6, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207031610/http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=10492|archivedate=February 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that immigrants are more likely to work in risky jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average characteristics, such as immigrants' lower English language ability and educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Zavodny|first2=M.|year=2009|title=Do Immigrants Work in Riskier Jobs? |journal=Demography|volume=46|issue=3|pages=535–51|doi=10.1353/dem.0.0064|pmc=2831347|pmid=19771943|last1=Pia m.

==== Fiscal effects ====
A 2011 literature review of the economic impacts of immigration found that the net fiscal impact of migrants varies across studies but that the most credible analyses typically find small and positive fiscal effects on average.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Sari Pekkala |last=Kerr |first2=William R. |last2=Kerr |year=2011 |title=Economic Impacts of Immigration: A Survey |journal=Finnish Economic Papers |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=1–32 |doi= |url=https://www.taloustieteellinenyhdistys.fi/images/stories/fep/fep12011/fep12011_kerr_and_kerr.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the authors, "the net social impact of an immigrant over his or her lifetime depends substantially and in predictable ways on the immigrant's age at arrival, education, reason for migration, and similar".&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

According to James Smith, a senior economist at Santa Monica-based [[RAND Corporation]] and lead author of the [[United States National Research Council]]'s study ''"[[The New Americans: Economic, Demographic, and Fiscal Effects of Immigration]]"'', immigrants contribute as much as $10 billion to the [[U.S. economy]] each year.&lt;ref name="sfgate20" /&gt; The NRC report found that although immigrants, especially those from Latin America, caused a net loss in terms of taxes paid versus social services received, immigration can provide an overall gain to the domestic economy due to an increase in pay for higher-skilled workers, lower prices for goods and services produced by immigrant labor, and more efficiency and lower wages for some owners of capital. The report also notes that although immigrant workers compete with [[domestic worker]]s for low-skilled jobs, some immigrants specialize in activities that otherwise would not exist in an area, and thus can be beneficial for all domestic residents.&lt;ref name="demographic" /&gt;

Immigration and foreign labor documentation fees increased over 80% in 2007, with over 90% of funding for USCIS derived from immigration application fees, creating many USCIS jobs involving immigration to US, such as immigration interview officials, finger print processor, Department of Homeland Security, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/290/285071.html|title=Report to Congressional Requesters: January 2009:|publisher=United States Government Accountability Office|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063112/http://www.gao.gov/assets/290/285071.html|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 literature by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found that estimating the fiscal effects of undocumented immigrants has proven difficult:  "currently available estimates have significant limitations; therefore, using them to determine an aggregate effect across all states would be difficult and prone to considerable error". The impact of undocumented immigrants differs on federal levels than state and local levels,&lt;ref name=":182" /&gt; with research suggesting modest fiscal costs at the state and local levels but with substantial fiscal gains at the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jrlsasw39&amp;div=42&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Fear vs. Facts: Examining the Economic Impact of Undocumented Immigrants in the U.S.|website=heinonline.org|access-date=February 9, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525112458/http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals%2Fjrlsasw39&amp;div=42&amp;id=&amp;page=|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a study by the [[Cato Institute]], a [[free market]] [[think tank]], found that legalization of low-skilled illegal resident workers in the US would result in a net increase in US GDP of $180 billion over ten years.&lt;ref name="washingtonindependent" /&gt; The Cato Institute study did not examine the impact on per capita income for most Americans. Jason Riley notes that because of progressive income taxation, in which the top 1% of earners pay 37% of federal income taxes (even though they actually pay a lower tax percentage based on their income), 60% of Americans collect more in government services than they pay in, which also reflects on immigrants.&lt;ref name="Let Them In: The Case for Open Borders" /&gt; In any event, the typical immigrant and his children will pay a net $80,000 more in their lifetime than they collect in government services according to the NAS.&lt;ref name="cato23" /&gt; Legal immigration policy is set to maximize net taxation. Illegal immigrants even after an amnesty tend to be recipients of more services than they pay in taxes. In 2010, an [[econometrics]] study by a [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] [[economist]] found that immigration helped increase bilateral trade when the incoming people were connected via networks to their country of origin, particularly boosting trade of [[final goods]] as opposed to [[intermediate goods]], but that the trade benefit weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American culture.&lt;ref name="twsA36" /&gt;

According to NPR in 2005, about 3% of illegal immigrants were working in [[Agriculture in the United States|agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4703307 Study Details Lives of Illegal Immigrants in U.S.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226223541/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4703307 |date=December 26, 2011 }}".

Overall losses caused by the act were $1 billion; it was estimated that the figure would become over $20 billion if all the estimated 325,000 unauthorized workers left Georgia.

==== Discrimination ====
Irish immigration was opposed in the 1850s by the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[Know Nothing]] movement, originating in New York in 1843. It was engendered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by [[Irish Catholic]] immigrants. On [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|March 14, 1891]], a lynch mob stormed a local jail and lynched several [[Italians]] following the acquittal of several Sicilian immigrants alleged to be involved in the murder of [[New Orleans]] police chief [[David Hennessy]]. The Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921, followed by the Immigration Act of 1924. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at limiting immigration overall, and making sure that the nationalities of new arrivals matched the overall national profile.

A 2014 meta-analysis found extensive evidence of [[Housing discrimination (United States)|racial discrimination in the American housing market]].&lt;ref name=":75" /&gt; Minority applicants for housing needed to make many more enquiries to view properties.&lt;ref name=":75" /&gt; Geographical steering of African-Americans in US housing remained significant.&lt;ref name=":75" /&gt; A 2003 study finds  "evidence that agents interpret an initial housing request as an indication of a customer's preferences, but also are more likely to withhold a house from all customers when it is in an integrated suburban neighborhood ([[redlining]]). Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas ([[Racial steering|steering]]); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white.

==== Assimilation ====
A 2018 study in the ''American Sociological Review'' found that within racial groups, most immigrants to the United States had fully assimilated within a span of 20 years.&lt;ref name=":36"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Immigrants' Economic Assimilation: Evidence from Longitudinal Earnings Records|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1177/0003122418780366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants arriving in the United States after 1994 assimilate more rapidly than immigrants who arrived in previous periods.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt; Measuring assimilation can be difficult due to "ethnic attrition", which refers to when ancestors of migrants cease to self-identify with the nationality or ethnicity of their ancestors. This means that successful cases of assimilation will be underestimated. Research shows that ethnic attrition is sizable in Hispanic and Asian immigrant groups in the United States.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Brian|last2=Trejo|first2=Stephen J|title=Tracking Intergenerational Progress for Immigrant Groups: The Problem of Ethnic Attrition |journal=American Economic Review|volume=101|issue=3|pages=603–08|doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.603|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alba|first=Richard|last2=Islam|first2=Tariqul|date=January 1, 2009|title=The Case of the Disappearing Mexican Americans: An Ethnic-Identity Mystery|journal=Population Research and Policy Review|volume=28|issue=2|pages=109–21|doi=10.1007/s11113-008-9081-x|jstor=20616620}}&lt;/ref&gt; By taking account of ethnic attrition, the assimilation rate of Hispanics in the United States improves significantly.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Brian|last2=Trejo|first2=Stephen|title=The Complexity of Immigrant Generations: Implications for Assessing the Socioeconomic Integration of Hispanics and Asians |journal=ILR Review |volume=70 |issue=5 |year=2017 |pages=1146–1175 |doi=10.1177/0019793916679613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 paper challenges the view that cultural differences are necessarily an obstacle to long-run economic performance of migrants. It finds that "first generation migrants seem to be less likely to success the more culturally distant they are, but this effect vanishes as time spent in the USA increases."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/Oxford-Economic-and-Social-History-Working-Papers/achieving-the-american-dream-cultural-distance-cultural-diversity-and-economic-performance|title=Achieving the American Dream: Cultural Distance, Cultural Diversity and Economic Performance {{!}} Oxford Economic and Social History Working Papers {{!}} Working Papers|website=www.economics.ox.ac.uk|access-date=May 18, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807014939/http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/Oxford-Economic-and-Social-History-Working-Papers/achieving-the-american-dream-cultural-distance-cultural-diversity-and-economic-performance|archivedate=August 7, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious diversity====
Immigration from South Asia and elsewhere has contributed to enlarging the religious composition of the United States. [[Islam in the United States]] is growing mainly due to immigration. [[Hinduism in the United States]], [[Buddhism in the United States]], and [[Sikhism in the United States]] are other examples.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Lippy, ''Faith in America: Organized religion today'' (2006) ch 6 pp 107–27&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas non-Christians together constitute only 4% of the U.S. population, they made up 20% of the 2003 cohort of new immigrants.&lt;ref name = "Massey_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Douglas S.|last2=Higgins|first2=Monica Espinoza|date= September 2011 |title=The Effect of Immigration on Religious Belief and Practice: A Theologizing or Alienating Experience? |journal=Social science research|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1371–1389|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.04.012 | pmc = 3629734|pmid=23606773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, an estimated 1.7 million Muslims, approximately 1 million Hindus, and approximately 1 million Buddhists have immigrated legally to the United States.&lt;ref name=pew-2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/05/17/the-religious-affiliation-of-us-immigrants/ |dead-url=yes |title=The Religious Affiliation of U.S. Immigrants: Majority Christian, Rising Share of Other Faiths |website=Pew Research Center |date=May 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805044821/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/05/17/the-religious-affiliation-of-us-immigrants/ |archivedate=August 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, non-religious are underrepresented in the immigrant populations. Although "other" non-Christian religions are also slightly more common among immigrants than among U.S. adults—1.9% compared with 1.0%—those professing no religion are slightly under-represented among new immigrants. Whereas 12% of immigrants said they had no religion, the figure was 15% for adult Americans.&lt;ref name = "Massey_2011" /&gt; This lack of representation for non-religious could be related to stigmas around atheists and agnostics or could relate to the need for identity when entering a new country.

=====Labor unions=====
{{Main|Immigration policies of American labor unions}}
The [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), a coalition of labor unions formed in the 1880s, vigorously opposed unrestricted immigration from Europe for moral, cultural, and racial reasons. The issue unified the workers who feared that an influx of new workers would flood the labor market and lower wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Collomp |first = Catherine | title = Unions, civics, and National identity: organized Labor's reaction to immigration, 1881–1897 | journal = [[Labor History (journal)|Labor History]] | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 450–474 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00236568800890311 | date = October 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nativism was not a factor because upwards of half the union members were themselves immigrants or the sons of immigrants from Ireland, Germany and Britain. However, nativism was a factor when the AFL even more strenuously opposed all immigration from Asia because it represented (to its Euro-American members) an alien culture that could not be assimilated into American society. The AFL intensified its opposition after 1906 and was instrumental in passing immigration restriction bills from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921 [[Emergency Quota Act]] and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], and seeing that they were strictly enforced.&lt;ref name="Mink"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gwendolyn |last=Mink |title=Old Labor and New Immigrants in American Political Development: Union, Party, and State, 1875–1920 |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1990 |edition= |isbn=0-8014-9680-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Lane |first = A.T. | title = American trade unions, mass immigration and the literacy test: 1900–1917 | journal = [[Labor History (journal)|Labor History]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–25 | doi = 10.1080/00236568408584739 | date = January 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mink (1986) concludes that the link between the AFL and the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] rested in part on immigration issues, noting the large corporations, which supported the Republicans, wanted more immigration to augment their labor force.&lt;ref name="Mink" /&gt;

[[United Farm Workers]] during [[Cesar Chavez]] tenure was committed to restricting immigration. Chavez and [[Dolores Huerta]], cofounder and president of the UFW, fought the [[Bracero Program]] that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined U.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964. In 1973, the UFW was one of the first labor unions to oppose proposed employer sanctions that would have prohibited hiring illegal immigrants.

On a few occasions, concerns that illegal immigrant labor would undermine UFW strike campaigns led to a number of controversial events, which the UFW describes as anti-strikebreaking events, but which have also been interpreted as being anti-immigrant. In 1973, Chavez and members of the UFW marched through the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial]] and [[Coachella Valley]]s to the border of Mexico to protest growers' use of illegal immigrants as strikebreakers. Joining him on the march were Reverend [[Ralph Abernathy]] and U.S. Senator [[Walter Mondale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov:8081/ammem/today/aug22.html|title=Today in History: August 22|last=|first=|date=January 19, 2011|website=Library of Congress:American Memory|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years, the UFW and Chavez went so far as to report illegal immigrants who served as strikebreaking replacement workers (as well as those who refused to unionize) to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520202198&amp;id=HAd4W9OdLX0C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;ots=X9eCyCQtaq&amp;dq=UFW+report+undocumented&amp;sig=I-BkkeqB84_UYgjh2Fs1affaln0#PPA197,M1|title=Walls and Mirrors: Mexican Americans, Mexican Immigrants and the Politics of Ethnicity|first=David Gregory|last=Gutiérrez|year=1995|pages=97–98|publisher=University of California Press|location=San Diego|isbn=9780520916869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/publications/media_monitor/2003/03/05.html|title=Why Journalists Support Illegal Immigration|publisher=Accuracy in the Media|first1=Reed|last1=Irvine|first2=Cliff|last2=Kincaid|accessdate=June 18, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203084534/http://www.aim.org/publications/media_monitor/2003/03/05.html|archivedate=December 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewnEO2GvkFIC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;ots=3bsbckEtw7&amp;dq=ufw+undocumented&amp;sig=5j3oluULLZo4AfXwTVqrmvMhyAQ#PPA90,M1|title=Strawberry Fields: Politics, Class, and Work in California Agriculture|first=Miriam J.|last=Wells|pages=89–90|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=9780801482793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnUgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ufw+undocumented&amp;q=crack+down&amp;pgis=1#search|title=Beyond the Border: Mexico &amp; the U.S. Today|first1=Peter|last1=Baird|first2=Ed|last2=McCaughan|page=169|publisher=North American Congress on Latin America|isbn=9780916024376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farmworker Collective Bargaining, 1979: Hearings Before the Committee on Labor Human Resources Hearings held in Salinas, Calif., April 26, 27, and Washington, D.C., May 24, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'' article attributed [[Barack Obama]]'s win in the [[United States Presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. Presidential election]] to a marked reduction over the preceding decades in the percentage of whites in the American electorate, attributing this demographic change to the Immigration Act of 1965.&lt;ref name="globe obama"/&gt; The article quoted [[Simon Rosenberg]], president and founder of the [[New Democrat Network]], as having said that the Act is "the most important piece of legislation that no one's ever heard of," and that it "set America on a very different demographic course than the previous 300 years."&lt;ref name="globe obama" /&gt;

Immigrants differ on their political views; however, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is considered to be in a far stronger position among immigrants overall.&lt;ref name="usatoday32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aaldef"/&gt; Research shows that religious affiliation can also significantly impact both their social values and voting patterns of immigrants, as well as the broader American population. Hispanic evangelicals, for example, are more strongly conservative than non-Hispanic evangelicals.&lt;ref name="uscmediareligion"/&gt; This trend is often similar for Hispanics or others strongly identifying with the [[Catholic Church]], a religion that strongly opposes abortion and gay marriage.

The key interests groups that lobby on immigration are religious, ethnic and business groups, together with some liberals and some conservative public policy organizations. Both the pro- and anti- groups affect policy.&lt;ref name="prachimishra"/&gt;

Studies have suggested that some [[special interest group]] lobby for less immigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups since they see effects of immigration, such as increased labor competition, as detrimental when affecting their own group but beneficial when affecting other groups.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

A 2011 paper found that both pro- and anti-immigration special interest groups play a role in migration policy. "Barriers to migration are lower in sectors in which business lobbies incur larger lobbying expenditures and higher in sectors where labor unions are more important."&lt;ref name="prachimishra"/&gt; A 2011 study examining the voting of US representatives on migration policy suggests that "representatives from more skilled labor abundant districts are more likely to support an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, whereas the opposite is true for representatives from more unskilled labor abundant districts."&lt;ref name="FacchiniSteinhardt2011"&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|last1=Facchini|first1=Giovanni|last2=Steinhardt|first2=Max Friedrich|url=http://www.dagliano.unimi.it/media/WP2010_294.pdf|title=What drives U.S. immigration policy?

After the 2010 election, Gary Segura of Latino Decisions stated that Hispanic voters influenced the outcome and "may have saved the Senate for Democrats".&lt;ref name="nclr"/&gt; Several ethnic lobbies support immigration reforms that would allow [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] that have succeeded in entering to gain citizenship. They may also lobby for special arrangements for their own group. The Chairman for the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform has stated that "the Irish Lobby will push for any special arrangement it can get—'as will every other ethnic group in the country.'"&lt;ref name="irishlobbyusa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nclr34"/&gt; The [[Irredentism|irredentist]] and ethnic [[separatist]] movements for [[Reconquista (Mexico)|Reconquista]] and [[Aztlán]] see immigration from Mexico as strengthening their cause.&lt;ref name="immigration35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washington"/&gt;

The book ''Ethnic Lobbies and US Foreign Policy'' (2009) states that several ethnic special interest groups are involved in pro-immigration lobbying. Ethnic lobbies also influence [[foreign policy]]. The authors write that "Increasingly, ethnic tensions surface in electoral races, with House, Senate, and gubernatorial contests serving as proxy battlegrounds for antagonistic ethnoracial groups and communities. In addition, ethnic politics affect party politics as well, as groups compete for relative political power within a party". However, the authors argue that currently ethnic interest groups, in general, do not have too much power in foreign policy and can balance other special interest groups.&lt;ref name="publishers"/&gt;

In a 2012 news story, ''Reuters'' reported, "Strong support from Hispanics, the fastest-growing demographic in the United States, helped tip President Barack Obama's fortunes as he secured a [[United States presidential election, 2012|second term in the White House]], according to Election Day polling."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/07/us-usa-campaign-latinos-idUSBRE8A62KR20121107 Hispanic vote tilts strongly to Obama in win] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111073300/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/07/us-usa-campaign-latinos-idUSBRE8A62KR20121107 |date=November 11, 2014 }}," ''Reuters,'' November 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===

The issue of the health of immigrants and the associated cost to the public has been largely discussed. On average, per capita health care spending is lower for immigrants than it is for native-born Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mohanty |first=Sarita A. |last2=Woolhandler |first2=Steffie |last3=Himmelstein |first3=David U. |last4=Pati |first4=Susmita |last5=Carrasquillo |first5=Olveen |last6=Bor |first6=David H. |date=August 1, 2005 |title=Health Care Expenditures of Immigrants in the United States: A Nationally Representative Analysis |url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2004.044602 |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=8 |pages=1431–1438 |doi=10.2105/ajph.2004.044602 |issn=0090-0036|pmc=1449377 |pmid=16043671}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-emergency use of emergency rooms ostensibly indicates an incapacity to pay, yet some studies allege disproportionately lower access to unpaid health care by immigrants.&lt;ref name="interdisciplinary"/&gt; For this and other reasons, there have been various disputes about how much immigration is costing the United States public health system.&lt;ref name="cato36"/&gt; [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] economist and Cato Institute scholar [[Julian Lincoln Simon]] concluded in 1995 that while immigrants probably pay more into the health system than they take out, this is not the case for elderly immigrants and refugees, who are more dependent on public services for survival.&lt;ref name="simon"/&gt; Immigration itself may impact women's health. A 2017 study found that Latino women suffer higher rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) than native US women. Migration may worsen IPV rates and outcomes. Migration itself may not cause IPV, but it may make it more difficult for women to get help. According to Kim et al., the IPV is usually the result of unequal family structures rather than the process of migration.&lt;ref&gt;Kim T, Draucker CB, Bradway C, Grisso JA, Sommers MS.

Immigration from areas of high incidences of disease is thought to have fueled the resurgence of [[tuberculosis]] (TB), [[Chagas disease|chagas]], and [[hepatitis]] in areas of low incidence.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; According to [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), TB cases among foreign-born individuals remain disproportionately high, at nearly nine times the rate of U.S.-born persons.&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdc37"/&gt; To reduce the risk of [[infectious diseases#Mortality from infectious diseases|diseases]] in low-incidence areas, the main countermeasure has been the screening of immigrants on arrival.&lt;ref name="cdc38"/&gt; [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] entered the United States in around 1969, likely through a single infected immigrant from

One of the first political analyses in the U.S. of the relationship between immigration and crime was performed in the beginning of the 20th century by the [[Dillingham Commission]], which found a relationship especially for immigrants from non-Northern European countries, resulting in the sweeping 1920s [[immigration reduction]] acts, including the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921, which favored immigration from [[Northern Europe|northern]] and [[western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/dillingham.html|title=Open Collections Program: Immigration to the US, Dillingham Commission (1907-1910)|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125123555/http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/dillingham.html|archivedate=January 25, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research is skeptical of the conclusion drawn by the Dillingham Commission. One study finds that "major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930, immigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all ages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments for violent offenses."&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moehling|first=Carolyn|last2=Piehl|first2=Anne Morrison|date=November 1, 2009|title=Immigration, crime, and incarceration in early twentieth-century america |journal=Demography|volume=46|issue=4|pages=739–63|doi=10.1353/dem.0.0076|pmid=20084827|issn=0070-3370|pmc=2831353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the early twentieth century, one study found that immigrants had "quite similar" imprisonment rates for major crimes as natives in 1904 but lower for major crimes (except violent offenses; the rate was similar) in 1930.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; Contemporary commissions used dubious data and interpreted it in questionable ways.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;

Research suggests that police practices, such as [[racial profiling]], over-policing in areas populated by minorities and in-group bias may result in disproportionately high numbers of immigrants among crime suspects.&lt;ref name="Warren 343–69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MoJ p. 82"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mit.edu/~westj/articles/JeremyWest_RacialBiasPolice.pdf|title=Racial Bias in Police Investigations|last=West|first=Jeremy|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307202800/http://www.mit.edu/~westj/articles/JeremyWest_RacialBiasPolice.pdf|archivedate=March 7, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Research also suggests that there may be possible discrimination by the judicial system, which contributes to a higher number of convictions for immigrants.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

==== Crimmigration ====
Crimmigration has emerged as a field in which critical immigration scholars conceptualize the current immigration law enforcement system. Crimmigration is broadly defined as the convergence of the criminal justice system and immigration enforcement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armenta|first=Amanda|date=2016|title=Radicalizing Crimmigration: Structural Racism, Colorblindness, and the Institutional Production of Immigrant Criminality|url=|journal=Sociology of Race and Ethnicity|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where immigration law enforcement has adopted the "criminal" law enforcement approach. This frames undocumented immigrants as "criminal" deviants and security risks.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García Hernández|first=César Cuauhtémoc|date=2013|title=Creating Crimmigration|url=|journal=Brigham Young University Law Review 1457|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime and migration control have become completely intertwined, so much so that both undocumented and documented individuals suspected of being a noncitizen may be targeted.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Using a "crimmigration" point of thought, César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; explains the criminalization of undocumented immigrants began in the aftermath of the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Michelle Alexander]] explores how the U.S. criminal justice system is made of "colorblind" policies and law enforcement practices that have shaped the mass incarceration of people of color into an era of "The New Jim Crow"&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Jim Crow: Mass incarceration in the age of colorblindnes|last=Alexander|first=Michelle|publisher=The New Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Alexander and García Hernández state, overt racism and racist laws became culturally scorned, and covert racism became the norm.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This new form of racism focuses on penalizing criminal activity and promoting "neutral" rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

"Crimmigration" recognizes how laws and policies throughout different states contribute to the convergence of criminal law enforcement and immigration law. For example, states are implementing a variety of immigration related criminal offenses that are punishable by imprisonment. California, Oregon, and Wyoming criminalize the use of fraudulent immigration or citizenship documents.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García Hernández|first=César Cuauhtémoc|date=2017|title=Abolishing Immigration Prisons|url=|journal=Boston University Law Review|volume=97|pages=17 – 05|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona allows judges to confine witnesses in certain "criminal" cases if they are suspected of being in the U.S. without documentation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The most common violations of immigration law on the federal level are unauthorized entry (a federal misdemeanor) and unauthorized reentry (a federal felony). These "offenses" deemed as "crimes" under immigration law set the tone of "crimmigration" and for what García Hernández refers to as the "removal pipeline" of immigrants.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Some scholars focus on the organization of "crimmigration" as it relates to the mass removal of certain immigrants. Jennifer Chacón finds that immigration law enforcement is being decentralized.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chacón|first=Jennifer|date=2010|title=A Diversion of Attention? Immigration Courts and the Adjudication of Fourth and Fifth Amendment Rights|url=|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=59|pages=1563–1633|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Patrol]] (CBP), [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) are the central law enforcement agencies in control of enforcing immigration law. However, other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, such as sheriff's offices, municipal police departments, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and the Drug and Enforcement Agency (DEA), aid in immigrant removal.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In 1996, Congress expanded power to state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law. These agencies keep people locked up in jails or prison when they receive an "immigration detainer" from ICE,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and therefore aid in interior enforcement.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In addition, some agencies participate in the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program ("SCAAP"), which gives these agencies financial incentives to cooperate with ICE in identifying immigrants in their custody.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These are direct example of how "crimmigration" works within the U.S. immigration system. With immigration enforcement reaching all levels of enforcement agencies, the Immigration Industrial Complex (which is similar to the [[Prison–industrial complex|Prison Industrial Complex]]) and concept of "crimmigration" thrives.

In the United States, a significant proportion of scientists and engineers are foreign-born, as well as students in science and engineering programs. However, this is not unique to the US since foreigners make up significant amounts of scientists and engineers in other countries. As of 2011, 28% of graduate students in science, engineering, and health are foreign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering: Fall 2011|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf13331/pdf/nsf13331.pdf|publisher=National Science Foundation|page=22|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of science and engineering (S&amp;E) bachelor's degrees has risen steadily over the past 15 years, reaching a new peak of about half a million in 2009. Since 2000, foreign born students in the United States have consistently earned a small share (3%-4%) of S&amp;E degrees at the bachelor's level. Foreign students make up a much higher proportion of S&amp;E master's degree recipients than of bachelor's or associate degree recipients. In 2009, foreign students earned 27% of S&amp;E master's degrees and 33% in doctorate degrees. Significant numbers of foreign born students in science and engineering are not unique to America since foreign students now account for nearly 60% of graduate students in mathematics, computer sciences, and engineering globally. In Switzerland and the United Kingdom, more than 40% of doctoral students are foreign. A number of other countries, including New Zealand, Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the United States, have relatively high percentages (more than 20%) of doctoral students who are foreign. Foreign student enrollment in the United Kingdom has been increasing. In 2008, foreign students made up 47% of all graduate students studying S&amp;E in the United Kingdom (an increase from 32% in 1998). Top destinations for international students include the United Kingdom (12%), Germany (9%), and France (9%). Together with the U.S.,these countries receive more than half of all internationally mobile students worldwide. Although the United States continues to attract the largest number and fraction of foreign students worldwide, its share of foreign students has decreased in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ch. 2 Higher Education in Science and Engineering|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/pdf/c02.pdf|publisher=National Science Foundation|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

55% of Ph.D. students in engineering in the United States are foreign born (2004).&lt;ref name=wulf&gt;William A. Wulf, President, National Academy of Engineering, Speaking before the 109th US Congress, September 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1980 and 2000, the percentage of Ph.D. scientists and engineers employed in the United States who were born abroad has increased from 24% to 37%.&lt;ref name=wulf/&gt; 45% of Ph.D. physicists working in the United States are foreign born in 2004.&lt;ref name=wulf/&gt; 80% of total post-doctoral [[Chemical Engineering|chemical]] and [[materials engineering]] in the United States are foreign-born (1988).&lt;ref name=osep&gt;'Foreign and Foreign-Born Engineers in the United States: Infusing Talent, Raising Issues', Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel, 1988.

At the undergraduate level, US-born engineering students constitute upwards of 90-95% of the student population (most foreign born candidates for engineering graduate schools are trained in their home countries). However, the pool of BS engineering graduates with US citizenship is much larger than the number who apply to engineering graduate schools.&lt;ref name=osep/&gt; The proportion of foreign-born engineers among assistant professors younger than 35 years has increased from 10% in 1972 to 50%-55% in 1983-1985, illustrating a dramatic increase on US dependence on foreign-born students in the US college system. The increase in non-citizen assistant professors of engineering is the result of the fact that, in recent years, foreign-born engineers received close to 50 percent of newly awarded engineering doctorates (naturalized citizens accounted for about 4 percent) and, furthermore, they entered academe in disproportionately large numbers.&lt;ref name=osep/&gt; 33% of all U.S. Ph.D.s in science and engineering are now awarded to foreign born graduate students  as of 2004.&lt;ref name=wulf/&gt;

In 1982, foreign-born engineers constituted about 3.6%  of all engineers employed in the United States, 13.9% of which were naturalized; and foreign-born Phds in Engineering constituted 15% and 20% were naturalized.&lt;ref name=osep/&gt; In 1985, foreign-born Phds represented almost 33% of the engineering post-doctorate researchers in US universities.  Foreign-born Phd engineers often accept postdoctoral position because other employment is unavailable until green card is obtained.&lt;ref name=osep/&gt;  A system that further incentivising replacement of US-citizens in the upper echelons of academic and private sector engineering firms due to higher educational attainment relative to native-born engineer who for the most part do train beyond undergraduate level.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;Walker, 'Incentivizing Replacement of Native Talent in the Upper Echelons of Science and Technology', Flattening the United States. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, The number of applicants for faculty openings at research universities have increased dramatically.  Numbers of 50 to 200 applications for a single faculty opening have become typical, yet even with such high numbers of applicants have yielded a foreign-born component in excess of 50%.&lt;ref name=osep/&gt; 60% of the top science students and 65 percent of the top math students in the United States are the children of immigrants. In addition, foreign-born high school students make up 50 percent of the 2004 U.S.Math Olympiad's top scorers, 38 percent of the U.S. Physics Team, and 25 percent of the Intel Science Talent Search finalists—the United States' most prestigious awards for young scientists and mathematicians.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;Anderson, 'The Multiplier Effect', International Educator. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among 1985 foreign-born engineering doctorate holders, about 40% expected to work in the United States after graduating.  An additional 17 percent planned to stay on as post-doctorates, and most of these are likely to remain permanently in the United States.  Those, almost 60% of foreign-born engineering doctorate holders are likely to become part of the US engineering labor force within a few years after graduating.  The other approximately 40% of foreign born engineering Phds mostly likely find employment working for [[Multinational corporations]] outside of the US.&lt;ref name=osep/&gt;

In the 2004 Intel Science Talent Search, more children (18) have parents who entered the country on H-1B (professional) visas than parents born in the United States (16). To place this finding in perspective, note that new [[H-1B visa]] holders each year represent less than 0.04 percent of the U.S. population.&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt; Foreign born faculty now accounts for over 50% of faculty in engineering (1994).&lt;ref name=osep/&gt;

===Lobbying===
Major American corporations spent $345 million [[lobbying]] for just three pro-immigration bills between 2006 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://churchandstate.org.uk/2016/02/how-did-opening-borders-to-mass-immigration-become-a-left-wing-idea/&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most prominent [[lobby groups|groups lobbying]] for more restrictive immigration policies for the United States are [[NumbersUSA]] and the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR); additionally, the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] [[think tank]] produces policy analysis supportive of a more restrictive stance.

==Public opinion==
The ambivalent feeling of Americans toward immigrants is shown by a positive attitude toward groups that have been visible for a century or more, and much more negative attitude toward recent arrivals. For example, a 1982 national poll by the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut showed respondents a card listing a number of groups and asked, "Thinking both of what they have contributed to this country and have gotten from this country, for each one tell me whether you think, on balance, they've been a good or a bad thing for this country," which produced the results shown in the table. "By high margins, Americans are telling pollsters it was a very good thing that Poles, Italians, and Jews immigrated to America. Once again, it's the newcomers who are viewed with suspicion. This time, it's the Mexicans, the Filipinos, and the people from the Caribbean who make Americans nervous."&lt;ref name="immigration48"/&gt;&lt;ref name="religion"/&gt;

In a 2002 study, which took place soon after the September 11 attacks, 55% of Americans favored decreasing legal immigration, 27% favored keeping it at the same level, and 15% favored increasing it.&lt;ref name="worldviews"/&gt;

In 2006, the immigration-reduction advocacy think tank the Center for Immigration Studies released a poll that found that 68% of Americans think U.S. immigration levels are too high, and just 2% said they are too low. They also found that 70% said they are less likely to vote for candidates that favor increasing legal immigration.&lt;ref name="immigration49"/&gt; In 2004, 55% of Americans believed legal immigration should remain at the current level or increased and 41% said it should be decreased.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The less contact a native-born American has with immigrants, the more likely one would have a negative view of immigrants.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

One of the most important factors regarding public opinion about immigration is the level of [[List of U.S. states by unemployment rate|unemployment]]; anti-immigrant sentiment is where unemployment is highest, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="interdisciplinary50"/&gt;

Surveys indicate that the U.S. public consistently makes a sharp distinction between legal and illegal immigrants, and generally views those perceived as "playing by the rules" with more sympathy than immigrants that have entered the country illegally.&lt;ref name="publicagenda51"/&gt;

According to a Gallup poll in July 2015, immigration is the fourth most important problem facing the United States and seven percent of Americans said it was the most important problem facing America today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riffkin|first1=Rebecca|title=Racism Edges Up Again as Most Important U.S. Problem|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/184193/racism-edges-again-important-problem.aspx|website=Gallup.com|publisher=Gallup Inc|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, another Gallup poll provided insight into American public opinion on immigration; the poll revealed that 39% of people worried about immigration "a great deal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Justin|title=In U.S., Worries About Terrorism, Race Relations Up Sharply|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/182018/worries-terrorism-race-relations-sharply.aspx|website=Gallup.com|publisher=Gallup Inc|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A January poll showed that only 33% of Americans were satisfied with the current state of immigration in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saad|first1=Lydia|title=U.S. Mood on Economy Up, Race Relations Sharply Down|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/181187/mood-economy-race-relations-sharply-down.aspx|website=Gallup.com|publisher=Gallup Inc|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an issue that is very important to Americans, polling reveals change in sentiment over time and diverse opinions regarding how to handle immigration.

Before 2012, majority of Americans supported securing United States borders compared to dealing with illegal immigrants in the United States. In 2013, that trend has reversed and 55% of people polled by Gallup revealed that they would choose "developing a plan to deal with immigrants who are currently in the U.S. illegally." Changes regarding border control are consistent across party lines, with Republicans saying that "securing U.S. borders to halt flow of illegal immigrants" is extremely important decreasing from 68% in 2011 to 56% in 2014. Meanwhile, Democrats who chose extremely important shifted from 42% in 2011 to 31% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jeffrey M.|title=In U.S., Border Security, Immigrant Status Equally Important|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/167432/border-security-immigrant-status-equally-important.aspx|website=Gallup.com|publisher=Gallup Inc.|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, 87% of Americans said they would vote in support of a law that would "allow immigrants already in the country to become U.S. citizens if they meet certain requirements including paying taxes, having a criminal background check and learning English." However, in the same survey, 83% also said they would support the tightening of U.S. border security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newport|first1=Frank|last2=Wilke|first2=Joy|title=Immigration Reform Proposals Garner Broad Support in U.S.|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/163169/immigration-reform-proposals-garner-broad-support.aspx|website=Gallup.com|publisher=Gallup Inc|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Trump's campaign for Presidency focused on a rhetoric of reducing illegal immigration and toughening border security. In July 2015, 48% of Americans thought that Donald Trump would do a poor job of handling immigration problems. In November 2016, 55% of Trump's voters thought that he would do the right thing in regards to illegal immigration. In general, Trump supporters are not united upon how to handle immigration. In December 2016, Trump voters were polled and 60% said that "undocumented immigrants in the U.S. who meet certain requirements should be allowed to stay legally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gramlich|first1=John|title=Trump voters want to build the wall, but are more divided on other immigration questions|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/29/trump-voters-want-to-build-the-wall-but-are-more-divided-on-other-immigration-questions/|website=PewResearch.org|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=November 17, 2017|date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American opinion regarding how immigrants affect the country and how the government should respond to illegal immigration have changed over time. In 2006, out of all U.S. adults surveyed, 28% declared that they believed the growing number of immigrants helped American workers and 55% believed that it hurt American workers. In 2016, those views had changed, with 42% believing that they helped and 45% believing that they hurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rainie|first1=Lee|last2=Brown|first2=Anna|title=Americans less concerned than a decade ago over immigrants' impact on workforce|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/07/americans-less-concerned-than-a-decade-ago-over-immigrants-impact-on-workforce/|website=PewResearch.org|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=November 17, 2017|date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRRI 2015 American Values Atlas showed that between 46% and 53% of Americans believed that "the growing number of newcomers from other countries&amp;nbsp;... strengthens American society." In the same year, 57% and 66% of Americans chose that the U.S. should "allow [immigrants living in the U.S. illegally] a way to become citizens provided they meet certain requirements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper |first1=Betsy |last2=Cox |first2=Daniel|last3=Lienesch|first3=Rachel|last4=Jones |first4=Robert P.|title=How Americans View Immigrants, and What They ... {{!}} PRRI|url=https://www.prri.org/research/poll-immigration-reform-views-on-immigrants/|website=PRRI.org|publisher=Public Religion Research Institute|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 	

In February 2017, the American Enterprise Institute released a report on recent surveys about immigration issues. In July 2016, 63% of Americans favored the temporary bans of immigrants from areas with high levels of terrorism and 53% said the U.S. should allow fewer refugees to enter the country. In November 2016, 55% of Americans were opposed to building a border wall with Mexico. Since 1994, Pew Research center has tracked a change from 63% of Americans saying that immigrants are a burden on the country to 27%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowman|first1=Karlyn|last2=O'Neil|first2=Eleanor|last3=Sims|first3=Heather|title=Welcome to America?

===Religious responses===
Religious figures in the United States have put forth their views on the topic of immigration as informed by their religious traditions.

* '''Catholicism''' &amp;ndash; In 2018, Catholic leaders stated that asylum-limiting laws proposed by the Trump administration were immoral. Some bishops considered imposing sanctions (known as "canonical penalties") on church members who have participated in enforcing such policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/06/13/catholic-bishops-call-trumps-new-asylum-rules-immoral-with-one-suggesting-canonical-penalties-for-those-involved/|title=Catholic bishops call Trump's asylum rules 'immoral,' with one suggesting 'canonical penalties' for those involved|first=Michelle|last=Boorstein|date=June 13, 2018|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Judaism''' &amp;ndash; American Jewish rabbis from various denominations have stated that their understanding of Judaism is that immigrants and refugees should be welcomed, and even assisted. The exception would be if there is significant economic hardship or security issues faced by the host country or community, in which case immigration may be limited, discouraged or even prohibited altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/jewish-ethicist/immigration/|title=Immigration - OU Torah|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some liberal denominations place greater emphasis on the welcoming of immigrants while Conservative, Orthodox and Independent rabbis also weigh economic and security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.momentmag.com/ask-the-rabbis-what-does-judaism-say-about-immigration/|title=Ask the Rabbis - What Does Judaism Say about Immigration?|date=January 14, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some provide moral arguments for both the right of country to enforce immigration standards as well as for providing some sort of amnesty for illegal migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1898474/jewish/A-Torah-Perspective-on-National-Borders-and-Illegal-Immigration.htm|title=A Torah Perspective on National Borders and Illegal Immigration|website=www.chabad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

===Laws concerning immigration and naturalization===

{{See also|Illegal immigration to the United States|Guest Worker Program}}
Laws concerning immigration and naturalization include:
*the [[Immigration Act of 1990]] (IMMACT), which limits the annual number of immigrants to 700,000. It emphasizes that family reunification is the main immigration criterion, in addition to employment-related immigration.
*the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996|Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act]] (AEDPA)
*the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act]] (IIRIRA)

AEDPA and IIRARA exemplify many categories of criminal activity for which immigrants, including [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] holders, can be deported and have imposed [[mandatory detention]] for certain types of cases.

In contrast to economic migrants, who generally do not gain legal admission, refugees, as defined by international law, can gain legal status through a process of seeking and receiving [[Right of asylum|asylum]], either by being designated a refugee while abroad, or by physically entering the United States and requesting asylum status thereafter. A specified number of [[refugee law|legally defined]] refugees, who either apply for asylum overseas or after arriving in the U.S., are admitted annually.{{Quantify|date=July 2010}} Refugees compose about one-tenth of the total annual immigration to the United States, though some large refugee populations are very prominent.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In the year 2014, the number of asylum seekers accepted into the U.S. was about 120,000.

In June 2012, President Obama issued a memorandum instructing officers of the federal government to defer deporting young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children as part of the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) program.  Under the program, eligible recipients who applied and were granted DACA status were granted a two-year deferral from deportation and temporary eligibility to work legally in the country.&lt;ref name="Hipsman2016"&gt;Faye Hipsman, Bárbara Gómez-Aguiñaga, &amp; Randy Capps, [http://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/DACAatFour-FINAL.pdf Policy Brief: DACA at Four: Participation in the Deferred Action Program and Impacts on Recipients] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525112538/http://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/DACAatFour-FINAL.pdf |date=May 25, 2017 }}, Migration Policy Institute (August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Among other criteria, in order to be eligible a youth applicant must (1) be between age 15 and 31; (2) have come to the United States before the age of 16; (3) have lived in the U.S. continuously for at least five years; (4) be a current student, or have earned a high school diploma or [[General Educational Development|equivalent]], or have received an [[honorable discharge]] from the U.S. armed services; and (5) must not "have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to public safety or national security."&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Batalova, Sarah Hooker &amp; Randy Capps, [http://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/DACA-Report-2014-FINALWEB.pdf DACA at the Two-Year Mark: A National and State Profile of Youth Eligible and Applying for Deferred Action] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525112549/http://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/DACA-Report-2014-FINALWEB.pdf |date=May 25, 2017 }}, Migration Policy Institute (August 2014), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Migration Policy Institution estimated that as of 2016, about 1.3 million unauthorized young adults ages 15 and older were "immediately eligible for DACA"; of this eligible population, 63% had applied as of March 2016.&lt;ref name="Hipsman2016"/&gt;

Children of legal migrants won't qualify as Dreamers under DACA protection because they entered the country legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1202486/h1b-j-and-o-visas-children-of-skilled-indian-workers-are-trapped-in-a-us-green-card-backlog/|title=A contradiction in US policy is putting children of skilled professionals at risk of deportation|first=Annalisa|last=Merelli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is highlighted as the biggest contradiction in US immigration policy by many advocates of legal immigrants.

In 2014, President Obama announced a [[Immigration reform#Obama.27s executive actions of November 2014|set of executive actions]], the [[Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents]]. Under this program, "unauthorized immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents (LPRs) would qualify for deferred action for three years if they meet certain other requirements."&lt;ref name="MPIDAPAFeb2016"&gt;Randy Capps, Heather Koball, James D.

===Military immigration===
On November 15, 2013, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that they would be issuing a new policy memorandum called "parole in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Policy Memorandum| url=http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2013/2013-1115_Parole_in_Place_Memo_.pdf| date=November 15, 2013| accessdate=June 2, 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219060835/http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2013/2013-1115_Parole_in_Place_Memo_.pdf| archivedate=February 19, 2015| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Parole in place would offer green cards to immigrant parents, spouses and children of active military duty personnel. Prior to this law relatives of military personnel – excluding husbands and wives – were forced to leave the United States and apply for green cards in their home countries. The law allows for family members to avoid the possible ten-year bar from the United States and remain in the United States while applying for lawful permanent residence.&lt;ref name="YorkParoleInPlace"&gt;{{cite web |last=York |first=Harlan |title="Parole in Place" for Immigrant Relatives of Military-What To Know |url=https://immigrationlawnj.com/new-rule-legalize-immigrant-relatives-military/ |date=November 15, 2013 |accessdate=June 4, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614105236/https://immigrationlawnj.com/new-rule-legalize-immigrant-relatives-military/ |archivedate=June 14, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parole status, given in one year terms, will be subject to the family member being "absent a criminal conviction or other serious adverse factors."&lt;ref name="YorkParoleInPlace" /&gt;

Military children born in foreign countries are considered American from birth assuming both parents were American citizens at the time of birth. Children born to American citizens will have to process Conciliary Reports of Birth Abroad. This report of birth abroad is the equivalent of a birth certificate and the child will use the report in place of a Birth Certificate for documentation. However, children born in foreign countries to United States servicemembers before they have gained citizenship could only gain citizenship through the naturalization process.

===Treatment as civil proceedings===

Most immigration proceedings are [[Civil law (common law)|civil matters]], including deportation proceedings, asylum cases, employment without authorization, and visa overstay. People who evade border enforcement (such as by crossing outside any official border checkpoint), who commit fraud to gain entry, or who commit [[identity theft]] to gain employment, may face criminal charges. People entering illegally were seldom charged with this crime until [[Operation Streamline]] in 2005. Conviction of this crime generally leads to a prison term, after which the person is deported if they are not eligible to remain in the country.

The guarantees under the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], such as the [[right to counsel]], and the right to a [[jury trial]], have not been held to apply to civil immigration proceedings.  As a result, people generally represent themselves in asylum and deportation cases unless they can afford an [[immigration lawyer]] or receive assistance from a legal charity. In contrast, the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] ''has'' been applied to immigration proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aliens' Right to Counsel in Removal Proceedings: In Brief |url=http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/library/P11612.pdf |publisher=Congressional Research Service |author=Kate M. Manuel |date=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the [[right to confrontation]] in the Sixth Amendment does not apply, people can be ordered deported ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' - without being present at the immigration proceeding.&lt;ref name="cnnGrievance"&gt;[https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/08/politics/immigration-judges-justice-department-grievance/index.html Immigration judge removed from cases after perceived criticism of Sessions]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Removal proceedings]] are considered [[administrative proceeding]]s under the authority of the [[United States Attorney General]], acting through the [[Executive Office for Immigration Review]], part of the [[United States Justice Department|Justice Department]]. Immigration judges are employees of the Justice Department, and thus part of the [[executive branch]] rather than the [[judicial branch]] of government.  Appeals are heard within the EOIR by the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]], and the Attorney General may intervene in individual cases, within the bounds of due process.&lt;ref name="cnnGrievance" /&gt;

After various actions by Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] pressuring judges to speed up deportations, the National Association of Immigration Judges and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' editorial board called for moving immigration courts to the judicial branch, to prevent abuse by strengthening [[separation of powers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://psmag.com/social-justice/immigration-court-judges-doubt-sessions-backlog-busting-plan Immigration Court Judges Are Skeptical of Jeff Sessions' Backlog-Busting Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2018/09/21/fire-jeff-sessions-boss-immigration-judges/KvUfiAtPSn5twNbju55i8L/story.html |title=Fire Jeff Sessions ... as the boss of immigration judges |author=Boston Globe editorial board |date=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detention policy===
{{main|Immigration detention in the United States}}
Whether people who are awaiting a decision on their deportation are detained or released to live in the United States in the meantime (possibly paying [[bail]]) is a matter of both law and discretion of the Justice Department. The policy has varied over time and differs for those with crimes (including entry outside an official checkpoint) versus civil infractions.

The 2001 Supreme Court case ''[[Zadvydas v. Davis]]'' held that immigrants who cannot be deported because no country will accept them cannot be detained indefinitely.

==Immigration in popular culture==
[[File:Immigrants1888.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A cartoon in [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'']] from 1888 attacked businessmen for welcoming large numbers of low paid immigrants, leaving the American men unemployed.&lt;ref name="amerikastudien"/&gt;]]
The history of immigration to the United States is the history of the country itself, and the journey from beyond the sea is an element found in [[American folklore]], appearing over and over again in everything from ''[[The Godfather]]'' to ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' to "[[Song of Myself|The Song of Myself]]" to [[Neil Diamond]]'s "America" to the animated feature ''[[An American Tail]]''.&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt;

From the 1880s to the 1910s, vaudeville dominated the popular image of immigrants, with very popular caricature portrayals of ethnic groups. The specific features of these caricatures became widely accepted as accurate portrayals.&lt;ref name="amerikastudien54"/&gt;

In ''The Melting Pot'' (1908), playwright [[Israel Zangwill]] (1864–1926) explored issues that dominated [[Progressive Era]] debates about immigration policies. Zangwill's theme of the positive benefits of the American [[melting pot]] resonated widely in popular culture and literary and academic circles in the 20th century; his cultural symbolism – in which he situated immigration issues – likewise informed American cultural imagining of immigrants for decades, as exemplified by Hollywood films.&lt;ref name="interdisciplinary55"/&gt;&lt;ref name="immigrants"/&gt;
The popular culture's image of ethnic celebrities often includes stereotypes about immigrant groups. For example, Frank Sinatra's public image as a superstar contained important elements of the ''[[American Dream]]'' while simultaneously incorporating stereotypes about Italian Americans that were based in nativist and Progressive responses to immigration.&lt;ref name="frontani"/&gt;

The process of assimilation has been a common theme of popular culture. For example, "lace-curtain Irish" refers to middle-class [[Irish Americans]] desiring assimilation into mainstream society in counterpoint to the older, more raffish "shanty Irish". The occasional malapropisms and left-footed social blunders of these upward mobiles were gleefully lampooned in vaudeville, popular song, and the comic strips of the day such as ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'', starring Maggie and Jiggs, which ran in daily newspapers for 87 years (1913 to 2000).&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="assimilation56"/&gt; In ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006), Staff Sergeant Dignam regularly points out the dichotomy between the lace curtain Irish lifestyle Billy Costigan enjoyed with his mother, and the shanty Irish lifestyle of Costigan's father. In recent years the popular culture has paid special attention to Mexican immigration&lt;ref name="immigration57"/&gt; and the film ''[[Spanglish (film)|Spanglish]]'' (2004) tells of a friendship of a Mexican housemaid ([[Paz Vega]]) and her boss played by [[Adam Sandler]].

===Immigration in literature===
[[File:Jiggsslum1740.jpg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|Maggie and Jiggs from ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'' (January 7, 1940).]]
Novelists and writers have captured much of the color and challenge in their immigrant lives through their writings.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Ferraro, ''Ethnic Passages: Literary Immigrants in Twentieth-Century America'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Irish women in the 19th century, there were numerous novels and short stories by Harvey O'Higgins, Peter McCorry, Bernard O'Reilly and [[Sarah Orne Jewett]] that emphasize emancipation from Old World controls, new opportunities and expansiveness of the immigrant experience.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Roa White, "Emigration as Emancipation: Portrayals of the Immigrant Irish Girl in Nineteenth-Century Fiction," ''New Hibernia Review,'' Spring 2005, Vol. 9 Issue 1, pp. 95–108&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Hladnik studies three popular novels of the late 19th century that warned Slovenes not to immigrate to the dangerous new world of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Miran Hladnik, "Slovene Popular Novels about Emigration in the Nineteenth Century," ''Slovene Studies,'' 1985, Vol. 7 Issue 1/2, pp. 57–62&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish American writer [[Anzia Yezierska]] wrote her novel ''Bread Givers'' (1925) to explore such themes as Russian-Jewish immigration in the early 20th century, the tension between Old and New World Yiddish culture, and women's experience of immigration. A well established author Yezierska focused on the Jewish struggle to escape the ghetto and enter middle- and upper-class America. In the novel, the heroine, Sara Smolinsky, escape from New York City's "down-town ghetto" by breaking tradition. She quits her job at the family store and soon becomes engaged to a rich real-estate magnate. She graduates college and takes a high-prestige job teaching public school. Finally Sara restores her broken links to family and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Ferraro, "'Working ourselves up' in America: Anzia Yezierska's ''Bread Givers''", ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' Summer 19 90, Vol. 89 Issue 3, pp. 547–91. reprinted in  Ferraro, ''Ethnic Passages,'' pp. 53–86&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Swedish author [[Vilhelm Moberg]] in the mid-20th century wrote a series of four novels describing one Swedish family's migration from Småland to Minnesota in the late 19th century, a destiny shared by almost one million people. The author emphasizes the authenticity of the experiences as depicted (although he did change names).&lt;ref&gt;Helmer Lång, and Michael Brook, "Moberg, the Emigrant Saga and Reality," ''Swedish Pioneer Historical Quarterly,'' 1972, Vol. 23 Issue 1, pp. 3–24&lt;/ref&gt; These novels have been translated into English (''[[The Emigrants (Swedish novel)|The Emigrants]]'', 1951, ''[[Unto a Good Land]]'', 1954, ''[[The Settlers (novel)|The Settlers]]'', 1961, ''[[The Last Letter Home]]'', 1961). The musical [[Kristina från Duvemåla]] by ex-[[ABBA]] members Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson is based on this story.&lt;ref name="introduction58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historical"/&gt;

''[[The Immigrant (musical)|The Immigrant]]'' is a musical by [[Steven Alper]], [[Sarah Knapp]], and [[Mark Harelik]]. The show is based on the story of Harelik's grandparents, Matleh and Haskell Harelik, who traveled to [[Galveston, Texas]] in 1909.&lt;ref name="colonytheatre"/&gt;

==Documentary films==
[[File:Immigrant to America.ogv|thumbtime=3:24|thumb|Film about historical immigration to America from ca. 1970]] 
In their documentary ''[[How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories]]'', filmmakers [[Shari Robertson]] and [[Michael Camerini]] examine the American political system through the lens of [[immigration reform]] from 2001 to 2007. Since the debut of the first five films, the series has become an important resource for advocates, policy-makers and educators.&lt;ref name="typepad"/&gt;

That film series premiered nearly a decade after the filmmakers' landmark documentary film ''[[Well-Founded Fear]]'' which provided a behind-the-scenes look at the [[Asylum in the United States|process for seeking asylum in the United States]]. That film still marks the only time that a film-crew was privy to the private proceedings at the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS), where individual asylum officers ponder the often life-or-death fate of immigrants seeking asylum.

==Overall approach to regulation==
University of North Carolina law professor Hiroshi Motomura has identified three approaches the United States has taken to the legal status of immigrants in his book ''Americans in Waiting: The Lost Story of Immigration and Citizenship in the United States''. The first, dominant in the 19th century, treated immigrants as in transition; in other words, as prospective citizens. As soon as people declared their intention to become citizens, they received multiple low-cost benefits, including the eligibility for free homesteads in the [[Homestead Act]] of 1869, and in many states, the right to vote. The goal was to make the country more attractive, so large numbers of farmers and skilled craftsmen would settle new lands. By the 1880s, a second approach took over, treating newcomers as "immigrants by contract". An implicit deal existed where immigrants who were literate and could earn their own living were permitted in restricted numbers. Once in the United States, they would have limited legal rights, but were not allowed to vote until they became citizens, and would not be eligible for the New Deal government benefits available in the 1930s. The third and more recent policy{{When|date=July 2010}} is "immigration by affiliation", which Motomura argues is the treatment which depends on how deeply rooted people have become in the country. An immigrant who applies for citizenship as soon as permitted, has a long history of working in the United States, and has significant family ties, is more deeply affiliated and can expect better treatment.&lt;ref name="immigration59"/&gt;

[[File:Statue-de-la-liberte-new-york.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|The [[Statue of Liberty]] was a common sight to many immigrants who entered the United States through [[Ellis Island]]]]
The [[American Dream]] is the belief that through hard work and determination, any United States immigrant can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice.&lt;ref name="economics"/&gt; According to historians, the rapid economic and industrial expansion of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a resource rich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief that anybody could get a share of the country's wealth if he or she was willing to work hard.&lt;ref name="pennsylvania"/&gt; This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States.&lt;ref name="american"/&gt;

'''Impasto''' is a type of coarse [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] pottery. The defining characteristic is that the clay contains chips of [[mica]] or stone.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Spivey, ''Etruscan Art'', page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In G.A. Mansuelli's, ''The Art of Etruria and Early Rome'' (1964), the term "impasto [[pottery]]" is described in the following way: "Ceramic technique characteristic of hand-worked vases. By 'impasto pottery' is generally meant that of pre-historic times, of the [[Iron Age]] or later, made of impure clay with [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] content." (p.&amp;nbsp;236)

'''Infodemiology''' (and the closely related term [[infoveillance]]) is a term coined by [[Canada|Canadian]] researcher [[Gunther Eysenbach]]. Eysenbach defines "infodemiology" (or information epidemiology) as a "new research discipline and methodology [which deals with] the study of the determinants and distribution of health information [on the Internet]", with the ultimate goal to improve [[public health]]&lt;ref name=Eysenbach2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eysenbach | first1 = Gunther | date = Dec 2002 | title = Infodemiology: The epidemiology of (mis)information | url = | journal = American Journal of Medicine | volume = 113 | issue = 9| pages = 763–5 | doi=10.1016/s0002-9343(02)01473-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="e2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eysenbach|first1=G|title=Infodemiology: tracking flu-related searches on the web for syndromic surveillance.|journal=AMIA ...

Eysenbach first used the term in the context of measuring and predicting the quality of health information on the web (i.e., measuring the "supply" side of information).&lt;ref name=Eysenbach2002/&gt; 
He later included into his definition methods and techniques which are designed to automatically measure and track health information "demand" (e.g., by analyzing search queries) as well as "supply" (e.g., by analyzing postings on webpages, in blogs, and news articles, for example through [[Global Public Health Intelligence Network|GPHIN]]) on the Internet with the overarching goal to inform public health policy and practice. In 2013, the Infovigil Project was launched in an effort bring the research community together to help realize this goal, and is funded by the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infodemiology.org|title=The Infovigil Project|last=Eysenbach|first=Gunther|website=www.infodemiology.org|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eysenbach demonstrated his point by showing a correlation between flu-related searches on [[Google]] (demand data) and flu-[[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] data.&lt;ref name=e2006/&gt; The method is shown to be better and more timely (i.e., can predict public health events earlier) than traditional [[syndromic surveillance]] methods such as reports by sentinel physicians.

'''IFAN''' ('''I.F.A.N.''', '''Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire''' or '''African Institute of Basic research''') is a cultural and scientific institute in the nations of the former [[French West Africa]].  Founded in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] in 1938 as the '''Institut français d’[[Sub-Saharan Africa|Afrique noire]]''' (the name was changed only in 1966), it was headquartered in what is now the building of the [[IFAN Museum of African Arts]].  Its charge was to study the language, history, and culture of the peoples ruled by [[French colonial empires|French colonialism]] in Africa.

==Early history==
IFAN first formed from a combination of three forces: the French colonial "[[Civilizing mission]]", the desire for more efficient [[Indirect rule]] through the understanding of African cultures, and research into the resources of the French dominion in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;See: David Robinson. Paths of accommodation: Muslim societies and French colonial authorities in Senegal and Mauritania, 1880-1920, Athens, Ohio University Press (2000) {{ISBN|0-8214-1353-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Governors General [[Ernest Roume]] (1902–1908) and [[William Ponty]] (1908–1914) oversaw a reorganization of the French higher educational system in the colonies, and placing [[Georges Hardy]] in charge, moved the colonial administration into a model which used elements from both a "Direct", [[Assimilation (French colonial)|Assimilationist]] policy and an [[Indirect rule|Indirect]], rule by African proxy policy.  The first required educational resources be created provided for the small minority of "''assimilated''" Africans, while the later required French colonial administrators be educated in the workings of African societies.  To these ends, Hardy oversaw the creation of the  [[École normale supérieure William Ponty]] (under the administration of [[Joseph Clozel]]), the publication ''Bulletin de l'Enseigement en AOF'', and the ''Comite d'etudes historiques et scientifiques de l'AOF'' (1918).  This last, immensely successful as a scientific journal, inaugurated  what one historian has called an era of "..knowledge and control." &lt;ref&gt;Robinson, ibid, (p.69 in French language edition, 2004, {{ISBN|2-84586-485-X}} )&lt;/ref&gt;

These imperial (or at best [[paternalist]]) scientific tools were turned on their head in a number of ways.  First, the African higher education system (and the École William Ponty in particular) became the incubator for the political leaders of the independence movement.  The study of African cultures, though invaluable to modern historians, did little to legitimize French rule through their [[Chefs du Canton]], but it did provide Francophone West Africans (such as [[Léopold Senghor]]) with the materials to bolster their sense of cultural importance, as demonstrated in the [[Negritude]] movement.  Finally, Europeans and Africans who opposed colonial rule came together in the years after the founding of IFAN in Dakar. IFAN was first conceived as an integration of various French colonial research systems in the early 1930s, and the vision was one of putting science to the service of the colonial project.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Galliard quotes a publication from the early 30s:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is for us a sort of intellectual duty and a requirement of colonial honour to study the countries that we must administer and the people that we must educate and protect. This is, in part, one of the strongest justifications for colonisation, and it cannot be defined in material and economic terms . . . . The establishment of African science is indeed an exigency of our colonial policy (IFAN, 1961: 37).&lt;/blockquote&gt; Jacques Gaillard. [http://ahero.uwc.ac.za/index.php?module=cshe&amp;action=downloadfile&amp;fileid=81806115512041001233965 "The Senegalese Scientific Community: Africanization, Dependence and Crisis"] in ''Scientific communities in the developing world''. Jacques Gaillard, V.V. Krishna and Roland Waast(eds). New Delhi, Thousand Oaks, Calif., and London: Sage Publications, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jules Brévié]], governor of [[French West Africa]] from 1930 to 1936, wrote that "colonization needs scholars, impartial and disinterested researchers with broad vision, outside of the urgency and fire of action. He wanted a methodical research program into colonial history and African culture, and lobbied for an official scientific institute to undertake geographical, ethnographic and historical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=70 |last=Wilder|first=Gary|title=The French Imperial Nation-State: Negritude and Colonial Humanism Between the Two World Wars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLqOeLn2MfcC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=2015-10-27 |date=2005-12-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-89768-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Popular Front government, in 1936, converted the ''Comite d'etudes historiques et scientifiques de l'AOF'' into the Dakar-based IFAN, and placed naturalist [[Théodore Monod]] at its head.
From the opening of the institute in 1938, Monod sought to promote Africans into positions of authority in IFAN, such as ethnologist [[Amadou Hampâté Bâ]].  With the end of the [[Second World War]], an influx of African intellectuals and French radicals (such as [[Jean Suret-Canale]]) found homes in IFAN and its branches, some taking part in political agitation through organisations like the [[Popular Front (Senegal)|Senegalese Popular Front]], the [[African Democratic Rally|RDA]], and the [[Communist Study Groups]] of the 1940s.

As independence loomed in the 1950s, IFAN became an increasingly African institution.  It formed a parallel [[National Archives]] to the Archives of the Governor General in Dakar,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivesdusenegal.gouv.sn/biblio.html Les Archives Nationales du Sénégal: La Bibliothèque, Présentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901172440/http://www.archivesdusenegal.gouv.sn/biblio.html |date=2012-09-01 }}. "l'arrêté 4803 du 24 novembre 1947 qui faisait de l'IFAN le dépositaire du dépôt légal".&lt;/ref&gt; with Monod and the IFAN answering directly to the [[Minister of Overseas France]] - a rare degree of autonomy under the [[French West Africa|AOF]] system. By independence IFAN had offices in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], [[Abidjan]], [[Bamako]], [[Cotonou]], [[Niamey]], [[Ouagadougou]], associated centers in [[Douala]] and [[Lomé]], and permanent scientific research stations in [[Atar]], [[Diafarabé]], and [[Mont-Nimba]]. The 1940s and 50s saw more such projects undertaken, such as the 1943 ''Office of Colonial Scientific Research'' (Now the ORSTOM Soil Research Centre in Dakar-Hann) and the [[University of Dakar]] in 1957.  Each of these institutions, begun as colonial instruments, evolved with the coming of independence into African tools to meet African needs.&lt;ref&gt;See J. Galliard, Passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence==
By independence in 1960 IFAN had branches across French West Africa, in all the cities which were to become the capitals of independent states.  The Dakar IFAN was transferred to [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]] in 1960, and Monod was kept on as director until 1965. In 1986 it was officially renamed "''IFAN Cheikh Anta Diop''", and maintains budgets, administration and staff independent of the university. It is today one of the most prestigious centers for the study of African culture in the world. As the main cultural research center of the colonies of French West Africa, it contains important collections from across Francophone Africa.  Most branches of IFAN, notably in [[Conakry]] ([[Guinea]]), [[Abidjan]] ([[Cote d'Ivoire]]), and [[Bamako]] ([[Mali]]), became the basis for national archives and research centers. Some still retain the "IFAN" title. The IFAN of [[French Soudan|Soudan Francais]] became the [[National Museum of Mali]], while IFAN of [[French Guinea]] became the ''Institut National de Recherche et Documentation'': the National Library, Archives and Museum of [[Guinea]].

==Publishing==
IFAN publishes a number of academic journals. ''Mémoire de l'IFAN'' and ''{{illm|Bulletin de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire|fr}}'' (abbreviated ''BIFAN'')  mostly deal with [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], history and [[archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;See the bibliographical essay on pp.304-305 of &lt;br /&gt;Peter Duignan, Lewis H. Gann, Victor Witter. ''Colonialism in Africa'', 1870-1960. Cambridge University Press (1975) {{ISBN|0-521-07859-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Centre de Linguistique Appliquée de Dakar, in conjunction with IFAN, has published extensive work on the [[Languages of Africa]], notably the multi-volume ''Lexique Wolof-Français''.  Other sections of IFAN have published collections on everything from the fish to the dance of the West African region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3283">The '''Institute for Law, Science and Global Security [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/]''' in the Department of Government at [[Georgetown University]] was established to promote teaching and research in the area of intersection between [[international law]] and [[international relations]]. The Institute sponsors undergraduate and graduate courses and runs a Master's Program in International Law and Global Security [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/programs/maprogram/]. The Institute seeks to inform the public policy debate about the nature, role and importance of international law as it connected to issues of science and global security. To this end, it sponsors a series of specific programs including the Program on Non-Proliferation Law and Policy [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/programs/nlp/], which is jointly run with the James Martin Center of the [[Monterey Institute of International Studies]]. 

Most recently, the Institute has begun a special initiative in the area of cyber security [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/events/disciplines/][http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/events/colloquium/cybersecurity/]. Among the participants in this initiative have been former Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[Michael Hayden (general)|General Michael Hayden]][http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=48778], Siobhan Gorman, national security correspondent of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and [[Suzanne Spaulding]], former General Counsel for the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]. Since its creation, the Institute has also sponsored events with a variety of other speakers, including [[Paul D. Clement]], former [[Solicitor General of the United States]], [[Bill Richardson]], the Governor of New Mexico, [[Neal Katyal]], Deputy Solicitor General of the United States and legal counsel to former detainee [[Salim Hamdan]], and [[David H.

'''Internal reconstruction''' is a method of recovering information about a [[language]]'s past from the characteristics of the language at a later date.

Whereas the [[comparative method]] compares variations between languages, such as in sets of [[cognate]]s, under the assumption that they descend from a single [[proto-language]], internal reconstruction compares variant forms within a single language under the assumption that they descend from a single, regular form. For example, they could take the form of [[allomorph]]s of the same [[morpheme]]. The basic premise of internal reconstruction is that a meaning-bearing element that alternates between two or more similar forms in different environments was probably a single form in the past into which alternation was introduced by the usual mechanisms of [[sound change]] and [[analogy]].&lt;ref name="LING-PPT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/~jlsmith/ling202/outlines/1031_int-reconstr.pdf|type=PDF|page=5|title=LING 202 Lecture Outline|last1=Smith|first1=Jennifer L.|date=2012-10-31|website=The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language forms [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] by means of internal reconstruction are denoted with the ''pre-'' prefix, as in pre-Old Japanese, like the use of ''proto-'' to indicate a language reconstructed by means of the comparative method, as in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. (However, the ''pre-'' prefix is sometimes used for an unattested prior stage of a language without reference to internal reconstruction.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible even to apply internal reconstruction to proto-languages reconstructed by the comparative method. For example, performing internal reconstruction on [[proto-Mayan]] would yield pre-proto-Mayan. In some cases, it is also desirable to use internal reconstruction to uncover an earlier form of various languages and then submit those ''pre-'' languages to the comparative method. Care must be taken, however, because internal reconstruction performed on languages before applying the comparative method can remove significant evidence of the earlier state of the language and so reduce the accuracy of the reconstructed [[proto-language]].

==Role in historical linguistics==

When undertaking a comparative study of a hitherto under analyzed family of languages it is worthwhile to get an understanding of their systems of alternations, if any, before tackling the greater complexities of analyzing entire linguistic structures. For example, Type A forms of verbs in [[Samoan language|Samoan]] (as in the example, below) are the citation forms, the forms in dictionaries and word lists, but when making historical comparisons with other Austronesian languages, one should not use Samoan citation forms with parts missing. (An analysis of the verb sets would alert the researcher to the certainty that many other words in Samoan have lost a final consonant.) Another way of looking at it is that internal reconstruction gives access to an earlier historical stage, at least in some details, of the languages being compared, which can be valuable: the more time that passes, the more changes accumulate in the structure of a (living) languages. Thus, the earliest known attestations of languages should be used with the comparative method.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Internal reconstruction, when it is not a sort of preliminary to the application of the comparative method, is most useful if the analytic power of the comparative method is unavailable.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Internal reconstruction can also draw limited inferences from peculiarities of distribution. Even before comparative investigations had sorted out the true history of Indo-Iranian phonology, some scholars had wondered if the extraordinary frequency of the phoneme {{IPA|/a/}} in Sanskrit (20% of all phonemes together, an astonishing total) might point to some historical fusion of two or more vowels. (In fact, it represents the final outcome of five different Proto-Indo-European syllabics of which the syllabic states of {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} can be discerned by the application of internal reconstruction.) However, in such cases, internal analysis is better at raising questions than at answering them. The extraordinary frequency of {{IPA|/a/}} in [[Sanskrit]] hints at some sort of historical event but does not and cannot lead to any ''specific'' theory.

==Issues and shortcomings==
===Neutralizing environments===
One issue in internal reconstruction is neutralizing environments, which can be an obstacle to historically correct analysis. Consider the following forms from Spanish, spelled phonemically rather than orthographically:

{| class="wikitable"  style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"
|-
! Infinitive !! !! Third person singular
|-
| [[wikt:volver#Spanish|bolbér]] || (re)turn || buélbe
|-
| [[wikt:probar#Spanish|probár]] || test || pruéba
|-
| [[wikt:dormir#Spanish|dormír]] || sleep || duérme
|-
| [[wikt:morir#Spanish|morír]] || die || muére
|-
| [[wikt:poner#Spanish|ponér]] || place || póne
|-
| [[wikt:doblar#Spanish|doblár]] || fold || dóbla
|-
| [[wikt:gozar#Spanish|goθár]] || enjoy || góθa
|-
| [[wikt:correr#Spanish|korrér]] || run || kórre
|}

One pattern of inflection shows alternation between {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ue/}}; the other type has {{IPA|/o/}} throughout. The lexical items are all basic, not technical or high register or obvious borrowings, so their behavior is likely to be a matter of inheritance from an earlier system rather than the result of some native pattern overlaid by a borrowed one. (An example of such an overlay would be the non-alternating English privative prefix ''un-'' next to the privative prefix in borrowed Latinate forms, which alternates between ''in-, im, ir-, il-''.)

One might guess that the difference between the two sets can be explained by two aboriginally different markers of the third person singular, but a basic principle of linguistic analysis is that one cannot analyze data one does not have (and should not try to). Besides that, positing such a history violates the principle of parsimony ([[Occam's Razor]]): it adds a complication to the analysis unnecessarily, a complication whose chief result is to restate the observed data as a sort of historical fact. That is, the result of the analysis is the same as the input. As it happens, the forms as given yield readily to real analysis, so there is no reason to look elsewhere.

The first assumption is that in pairs like bolbér/buélbe, the root vowels were originally the same. There are two possibilities: either something happened to make an original {{IPA|*/o/}} turn into two different sounds in the third person singular or the distinction in the third singular is original, and the vowels of the infinitives are in what is called a '''neutralizing environment''' (if an original contrast is lost because two or more elements "fall together", or coalesce into one). There is no way of telling ("predicting") when {{IPA|/o/}} will break to {{IPA|/ué/}} and when it will remain {{IPA|/ó/}} in the third person singular. On the other hand, starting with {{IPA|/ó/}} and {{IPA|/ué/}}, one can write an unambiguous rule for the infinitive forms: {{IPA|/ué/}} becomes {{IPA|/o/}}. One might notice further, upon looking around in Spanish, that the nucleus {{IPA|/ue/}} is found only in tonic syllables anywhere, not just in verb forms.

That analysis gains plausibility from the observation that the neutralizing environment is atonic, but the nuclei are different in tonic syllables. That fits with the commonplace that vowel contrasts are often preserved differently in tonic and atonic environments and that the usual relationship is that there are more contrasts in tonic syllables than in atonic ones (as previously distinctive vowels had fallen together in the atonic environment).

The idea that original {{IPA|*/ue/}} might fall together with original {{IPA|*/o/}} is unproblematic, so internally, a complex nucleus *''ue'' can be reconstructed that remains distinct when tonic and coalesces with *''o'' when atonic.

However, the true history is quite different: there were no diphthongs in Proto-Romance. There was an {{IPA|*o}} (reflecting Latin ''ŭ'' and ''ō'') and an {{IPA|*ɔ}} (reflecting Latin ''ŏ''). In Spanish, as in most other Romance languages, the two fall together in atonic syllables, but in stressed syllables, the {{IPA|*ɔ}} breaks into the complex nucleus {{IPA|/ue/}}. Internal reconstruction accurately points to two different historical nuclei in atonic {{IPA|/o/}}, but gets the details wrong.

=== Shared innovations ===
When applying internal reconstruction to related languages prior to applying the comparative method, one must check that the analysis does not remove the shared innovations that characterize subgroups. An example is [[consonant gradation]] in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], and [[Sami languages|Sami]]. A pre-gradation phonology can be derived for each of the three groups via internal reconstruction, but in fact, it was manifestly an innovation in the [[Finnic languages|Finnic branch]] of [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] rather than the individual languages. Indeed, it was one of the innovations defining that branch. This fact would be missed if the comparanda of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] family included as primary data the "de-graded" states of Finnish, Estonian, and Sami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2013), pp. 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lost conditioning factors ===
Not all synchronic alternation is amenable to internal reconstruction. Even if cases of secondary split (see [[phonological change]]) often result in alternations that signal a historical split, the conditions involved are usually immune to recovery by internal reconstruction. For example, the alternation of voiced and voiceless fricatives in [[Germanic languages]], as described in [[Verner's law]], cannot be explained only by examination of the Germanic forms themselves.

That a general characteristic of secondary split, but occasionally, internal reconstruction can work. Primary split in principle is recoverable by internal reconstruction whenever it results in alternations, but later changes can render the conditioning irrecoverable.

==Examples==

===English===
English has two patterns for forming the past tense in roots ending in [[Apical consonant|apical]] stops, i.e. {{IPA|/t d/}}.

Although modern English has very little affixal morphology, its number includes a marker of the preterite, apart from verbs with vowel changes of the ''find/found'' sort, and the great majority of verbs that end in {{IPA|/t d/}} take {{IPA|/ɪd/}} as the marker of the preterite, as seen in Type I.

Can we make any generalizations about the membership of verbs in Types I and II? Most obviously, the Type II verbs all end in {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, though that is just like the members of Type I. Less obviously they are all without exception basic vocabulary. Note well that this is a claim about Type II verbs and not a claim about basic vocabulary: there are basic home-and-hearth verbs in Type I, too. But there are no [[denominal verb|denominative verbs]] in Type II, that is, verbs like ''to gut, to braid, to hoard, to bed, to court, to head, to hand''. There are no verbs of Latin or (a little harder to spot) of French origin; all stems like ''depict, enact, denote, elude, preclude, convict'' are Type I. Furthermore, all novel forms are inflected as Type I: all native speakers of English would presumably agree that the preterites of ''to sned'' and ''to absquatulate'' would most likely be ''snedded'' and ''absquatulated''.

The inference from these considerations is that the absence of a "dental preterite" marker on roots ending in apical stops in Type II reflects a more original state of affairs, i.e.,  that in the early history of the language the "dental preterite" marker was in a sense absorbed into the root-final consonant when it was {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}; the affix {{IPA|/ɪd/}} after word-final apical stops then belongs to a later stratum in the evolution of the language. The same suffix is involved in both types, but with a 180° reversal of "strategy": other exercises of internal reconstruction would point to the conclusion that the aboriginal affix of the dental preterites was {{IPA|/Vd/}} (where V = a vowel of uncertain phonetics, and of course an inspection of Old English directly would reveal several different stem-vowels in the mix). In modern formations, it is stems ending in {{IPA|/t d/}} that ''preserve'' the vowel of the preterite marker; in an earlier day, odd as it might seem, the loss of the stem vowel had taken place already prehistorically whenever the root ended in an apical stop.

===Latin===
In Latin there are many examples of "word families" showing vowel alternations. Some of these are examples of Indo-European [[ablaut]]:
''pendō'' "weigh", ''pondus'' "a weight"; ''dōnum'' "gift", ''datum'' "a given", ''caedō'' "cut" perf. ''ce-cid-'', ''dīcō'' "speak", participle ''dictus'', that is, inherited from the proto-language. (Note: all unmarked vowels in these examples are short.) But some, involving only short vowels, clearly arose within Latin. Examples:

''faciō'' "do", participle ''factus'', but ''perficiō, perfectus'' "complete, accomplish"; ''amīcus'' "friend" but ''inimīcus'' "unfriendly, hostile"; ''legō'' "gather", but ''colligō'' "bind, tie together", participle ''collectus''; ''emō'' "take; buy", but ''redimō'' "buy back", participle ''redemptus''; ''locus'' "place" but ''īlicō'' "on the spot" (&lt; *''stloc-/*instloc-''); ''capiō'' "take, seize", participle ''captus'' but ''percipiō'' "lay hold of", ''perceptus''; ''arma'' "weapon" but ''inermis'' "unarmed"; ''causa'' "lawsuit, quarrel" but ''incūsō'' "accuse, blame"; ''claudō'' "shut", ''inclūdō'' "shut in"; ''caedō'' "fell, cut", but ''concīdō'' "cut to pieces"; ''damnō''  "find guilty" but ''condemnō'' "sentence" (verb); and many, many more of the same sort. Briefly: vowels in initial syllables never alternate in this way, but in non-initial syllables (omitting some details) short vowels of the simplex forms become -''i''- before a single consonant and -''e''- before two consonants; the diphthongs -''ae''- and -''au''- of initial syllables alternate with medial -''ĩ''- and -''ũ''-, respectively.

Now, reduction in contrast in a vowel system (for that is what has happened here) is very commonly associated with position in atonic (unaccented) syllables, but in Latin the tonic accent of say ''reficiō'' and ''refectus'' is on the same syllable as simplex ''faciō, factus'', and that is true of almost all of the examples given (''cólligō, rédimō, īlicō'' (initial-syllable accent) are the only exceptions), and indeed for most of the examples of these alternations throughout the language. Obviously the reduction of contrast points in the vowel system (-''a''- and ''-o''- fall together with -''i''- before a single consonant, with -''e''- before two consonants; long vowels replace diphthongs) cannot have anything to do with the location of the accent in '''attested''' Latin:

The accentual system of Latin is well-known, partly from statements by Roman grammarians and partly from agreements among the Romance languages on the location of tonic accent: the tonic accent in Latin fell three syllables before the end of any word with three or more syllables, unless the second-to-last syllable (called the ''penult'' in classical linguistics) was "heavy", i.e. contained a diphthong, a long vowel, or was followed by two or more consonants, in which case that syllable has the tonic accent. Thus ''perfíciō, perféctus, rédimō, condémnō, inérmis''.

If there is any connection, then, between word-accent and vowel-weakening, the accent in question cannot be that of Classical Latin. Since the vowels of initial syllables never show this weakening (to oversimplify a bit), the obvious inference is that at some point in prehistory, the tonic accent must have been a "stationary" accent always falling on the first syllable of a word. Such an accentual system is very common in the world's languages ([[Czech language|Czech]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and, with certain complications, [[High German]] and [[Old English]], etc., etc.), but was definitely '''not''' the accentual system of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. Therefore, on the basis of internal reconstruction within Latin, we discover a prehistoric sound-law that replaced the inherited accentual system with an automatic initial-syllable accent which, in turn, was replaced by the attested accentual system. As it happens, [[Celtic languages]] likewise have an automatic word-initial accent (subject, like the [[Germanic languages]], to certain exceptions, mainly certain pretonic prefixes). Celtic, Germanic, and [[Italic languages]] share some other features as well, and it is tempting to think that the word-initial accent system was an "areal feature" as it is called, but that would be more speculative than the inference of a prehistoric word-initial accent for Latin specifically.

There is a very similar set of givens in English, but with very different consequences for internal reconstruction. There is pervasive alternation between long and short vowels (the former now phonetically diphthongs): between {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} and {{IPAc-en|ɪ}} in words like ''divide, division; decide, decision''; between {{IPAc-en|oʊ}} and {{IPAc-en|ɒ}} in words like ''provoke, provocative; pose, positive''; between {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} and {{IPAc-en|ʌ}} in words like ''pronounce, pronunciation; renounce, renunciation; profound, profundity''; and many other examples. As in the Latin example, the tonic accent of present-day English is often on the syllable showing the vowel alternation. In the Latin case, it was possible to frame an explicit hypothesis regarding the location of word-accent in prehistoric Latin that would account for both the vowel alternations and the attested system of accent. Indeed, such a hypothesis is hard to avoid. By contrast, the alternations in English do '''not''' point to any specific hypothesis, only a general suspicion that word accent must be the explanation, and that the accent in question must have been different from that of modern-day English. Where the accent used to be, and what the rules (if any) are for its relocation in present-day English, cannot be recovered by internal reconstruction. In fact, even the givens are uncertain: it is not even possible to tell whether we are dealing with ''lengthening'' in tonic syllables or ''shortening'' in atonic ones. (And in historical fact, both are involved.) Part of the problem is that English has alternations between diphthongs and monophthongs (i.e., between Middle English long and short vowels, respectively) from no fewer than six different sources, the oldest (for example ''write, written'') dating all the way back to Proto-Indo-European. But even if it were possible (it is not) to sort out the corpus of affected words, sound changes subsequent to the relocation of tonic accent have eliminated the necessary conditions for framing accurate sound laws. It is, in fact, possible to reconstruct the history of the English vowel system with great accuracy, but not by internal reconstruction. (In a nutshell, at the time of the atonic shortening, the tonic accent lay two syllables to the right of the affected vowel and was subsequently retracted to its present-day position. But in words like ''division'' and ''vicious'' (cf. ''vice'') have lost a syllable in the first place, which would be an insuperable obstacle to correct analysis.)

'''Katrina Cottages''' are small residential shelters designed and marketed in the [[United States]] in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]] (August 2005).  They were designed as a response to the inadequacies of the [[FEMA trailer|trailers]] issued to flood victims by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA). The homes' designs attempt to fulfill the needs of their occupants in a more permanent and humane manner, while addressing the challenges of building and protecting a home in the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast region]], particularly in southern [[Louisiana]] where much of the land currently used is below sea level and protected by [[levee]]s.  The cottages are also common in parts of storm surge damaged coastal [[Mississippi]].  Though designs may vary, the main aesthetic criterion is that Katrina Cottages resemble traditional homes in the area in appearance, scaled-down in size to reduce costs and ease construction so that multiple units can be built quickly as needed.

The best-known of these designs are those by [[Marianne Cusato]], whose original "Katrina Cottage" made the term popular and received in 2006 the first annual [[National Design Awards|People's Design Award]] from the [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum|Cooper-Hewitt Museum]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. As Cusato's design and others gained increasing media attention, the number of designs has increased, as has interest in smaller dwellings as a whole.  Home improvement retailer [[Lowe's]] offered pre-packaged Katrina Cottage kits, including plans and all materials needed for construction. A [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] pilot program accommodating 900 Mississippi coast families encountered strong opposition from local government officials opposed to permanent small housing units, fearing they would lower property values.  On the other hand, Mississippi Governor [[Haley Barbour]] urged local officials to accept the cottages as safer than trailers.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-cottage16dec16,0,1175332.story?coll=la-home-center Jarvie, Jennie.  "Post-Katrina cottages get a lukewarm welcome," Los Angeles Times, 16 Dec. 2007, accessed 6 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially offered through Lowe's stores in [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]], in 2008 Lowe's began offering the cottages at all of its stores nationwide.&lt;ref name="treehug"&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/06/katina-cottage-lowes-nationwide.php Alter, Lloyd.

===''The Wizard of Oz'' on screen and back to stage===
Early film treatments of Baum's book included [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1910 film)|1910]] and [[Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|1925]], as well as Baum's own venture [[The Oz Film Manufacturing Company]]. [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]] made the story into the now-classic movie ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) starring [[Judy Garland]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]. It was only MGM's second feature-length film in three-strip [[Technicolor]] (the first being ''[[Sweethearts (1938 film)|Sweethearts]]'' (1938), based on the [[Victor Herbert]] operetta). Among other changes, the film ended by treating the entire adventure as a dream. (Baum used this technique only in ''Mr. Woodchuck'', and in that case the title character explicitly told the dreamer numerous times that she was dreaming.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}})

A completely new [[Tony Award]]-winning Broadway musical with an African-American cast, ''[[The Wiz]]'', was staged in 1975 with [[Stephanie Mills]] as Dorothy. It was the basis for [[The Wiz (film)|a 1978 film by the same title]] starring [[Diana Ross]] as an adult Dorothy and [[Michael Jackson]] as the Scarecrow.

''The Wizard of Oz'' continues to inspire new versions, such as Disney's ''[[Return to Oz]]'' (1985), ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Tin Man (TV miniseries)|Tin Man]]'' (a re-imagining of the story televised in late 2007 on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]), and a variety of animated productions. Today's most successful Broadway show ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' provides a history to the two Oz witches used in the classic MGM film. [[Gregory Maguire]], author of the novel ''Wicked'' on which the musical is based, chose to honor L. Frank Baum by naming his main character [[Elphaba]]—a phonetic play on Baum's initials.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The film ''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]'' (2013) pays homage to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brookes|title=One More Trip to Land of Oz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/business/media/disney-gambles-on-box-office-wizardry-of-oz.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=March 5, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stars [[James Franco]], [[Mila Kunis]], [[Rachel Weisz]], and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]].

A '''library''' is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/library|title=Library – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|website=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both.&lt;ref&gt;"Library ... collection of books, public or private; room or building where these are kept; similar collection of films, records, computer routines, etc. or place where they are kept; series of books issued in similar bindings as set." – Allen, R. E., ed. (1984) ''The Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; A library's collection can include [[book]]s, [[Periodical literature|periodicals]], [[newspaper]]s, [[manuscript]]s, [[film]]s, [[map collection|maps]], [[print room|prints]], [[document]]s, [[microform]], [[compact disc|CDs]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]], [[videotape]]s, [[DVD]]s, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Discs]], [[e-book]]s, [[audiobook]]s, [[database]]s, and other formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items. In Latin and Greek, the idea of a [[bookcase]] is represented by ''Bibliotheca'' and ''Bibliothēkē'' (Greek: βιβλιοθήκη): derivatives of these mean ''library'' in many modern languages, e.g. French ''bibliothèque''.

The first libraries consisted of [[archive]]s of the [[Writing#The beginning of writing|earliest form of writing]]—the [[clay tablet]]s in [[cuneiform script]] discovered in [[Sumer]], some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in [[classical Greece]] in the 5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of [[Imperial Library of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandria]].

A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation, or a private individual. Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to—or cannot afford to—purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of [[librarian]]s who are experts at finding and organizing information and at interpreting information needs. Libraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to facilitate group study and collaboration. Libraries often provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources and the [[Internet]].

Modern libraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted access to [[information]] in many formats and from many sources. They are extending services beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material accessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of digital resources. Libraries are increasingly becoming community hubs where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning. As community centers, libraries are also becoming increasingly important in helping communities mobilize and organize for their rights. The relationship between [[librarianship and human rights]] works to ensure that the rights of cultural minorities, immigrants, the homeless, the disabled, LGBTQ community, as well as other marginalized groups are not infringed upon as protected in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

The first libraries consisted of [[archive]]s of the [[Writing#The beginning of writing|earliest form of writing]]—the [[clay tablet]]s in [[cuneiform script]] discovered in temple rooms in [[Sumer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECBkVPQkNSsC&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Libraries in the Ancient World |first=Lionel |last=Casson |page=3 |publisher=Yale University Press |date=11 August 2002 |accessdate=7 March 2012|isbn=978-0300097214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krasner&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history-magazine.com/libraries.html |title=History Magazine |first=Barbara |last=Krasner-Khait |website=history-magazine.com |year=2010 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; some dating back to 2600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/05/06_tablet.shtml |title=Clay cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia to be placed online |first=Kathleen |last=Maclay |date=6 May 2003 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These archives, which mainly consisted of the records of commercial transactions or inventories, mark the end of [[prehistory]] and the start of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, Colin.

Things were much the same in the government and temple records on [[papyrus]] of [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt; The earliest discovered private archives were kept at [[Ugarit]]; besides correspondence and inventories, texts of myths may have been standardized practice-texts for teaching new scribes. There is also evidence of libraries at [[Nippur]] about 1900 BC and those at [[Nineveh]] about 700 BC showing a [[library classification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;''The American International Encyclopedia'', New York: J. J. Little &amp; Ives, 1954; Volume IX&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 30,000 clay tablets from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] have been discovered at Nineveh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/ashurbanipal_library_phase_1.aspx |title="Assurbanipal Library Phase 1", British Museum One |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing modern scholars with an amazing wealth of Mesopotamian literary, religious and administrative work. Among the findings were the [[Enûma Eliš|Enuma Elish]], also known as ''the Epic of Creation'',&lt;ref&gt;"Epic of Creation", in [[Stephanie Dalley|Dalley, Stephanie]]. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989; pp. 233–81&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts a traditional Babylonian view of creation; the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'';&lt;ref&gt;"Epic of Gilgamesh", in Dalley, Stephanie. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989; pp. 50–135&lt;/ref&gt; a large selection of "omen texts" including ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' which "contained omens dealing with the moon, its visibility, eclipses, and conjunction with planets and fixed stars, the sun, its corona, spots, and eclipses, the weather, namely lightning, thunder, and clouds, and the planets and their visibility, appearance, and stations";&lt;ref&gt;Van De Mieroop, Marc. ''A History of the Ancient Near East ca. 3000–323 BC''. Oxford, UK: [[Blackwell Publishing]], 2007: pg. 263&lt;/ref&gt; and astronomic/astrological texts, as well as standard lists used by scribes and scholars such as word lists, bilingual vocabularies, lists of signs and synonyms, and lists of medical diagnoses.

The tablets were stored in a variety of containers such as wooden boxes, woven baskets of reeds, or clay shelves.  The "libraries" were cataloged using colophons, which are a publisher's imprint on the spine of a book, or in this case a tablet.  The colophons stated the series name, the title of the tablet, and any extra information the scribe needed to indicate.  Eventually, the clay tablets were organized by subject and size.  Unfortunately, due to limited to bookshelf space, once more tablets were added to the library, older ones were removed, which is why some tablets are missing from the excavated cities in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Weitemeyer, M. (1956). Archive and library technique in ancient Mesopotamia. ''Libri: International Journal of Libraries, 6''(3). 217–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, mythical philosopher [[Laozi]] was keeper of books in the earliest library in China, which belonged to the Imperial [[Zhou dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Mukherjee, A.

===Classical period===
[[File:Ancientlibraryalex.jpg|thumb|Artistic rendering of the [[Library of Alexandria]], based on some archaeological evidence]]
The [[Library of Alexandria]], in [[Egypt]], was the largest and most significant [[List of libraries in the ancient world|great library of the ancient world]].&lt;ref name="Sagan, C. 1980"&gt;Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Sagan, C 1980, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa1ImgOcOPM&amp;feature=related "Episode 1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean"]&lt;/ref&gt; It flourished under the patronage of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (323–283 BC) or during the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;II]] (283–246 BC).&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"&gt;Phillips, Heather A., [http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm "The Great Library of Alexandria?". Library Philosophy and Practice, August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; An early organization system was in effect at Alexandria.&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"/&gt; The Great Library of Alexandria would remain as the intellectual capital of the Western World during the rise of Christianity, even after the library had suffered through fires and conquest. This Great library was more than a place to hold books and records, it became a place of culture. The Alexandrian book collections steadily diminished as a result of natural causes, war, and wholesale theft by corrupt administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Library of Celsus]] in [[Ephesus]], [[Anatolia]], now part of [[Selçuk]], [[Turkey]] was built in honor of the [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]] [[Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swain |first=Simon |title=Dio Chrysostom: Politics, Letters, and Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |page=57 |isbn=9780199255214 |quote=Nevertheless, in 92 the same office went to a Greek, Ti. Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, who belonged to a family of priests of Rome hailing from Sardis; entering the Senate under Vespasian, he was subsequently to be appointed proconsul of Asia under Trajan, possibly in 105/6. Celsus' son, Aquila, was also to be made suffectus in 110, although he is certainly remembered more as the builder of the famous library his father envisioned for Ephesus. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicols, John 1978 109"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nicols |first=John |title=Vespasian and the partes Flavianae |publisher=Steiner |year=1978 |page=109 |isbn=9783515023931 |quote=Ti. Julius Celsus Polemaeanus (PIR2 J 260) was a romanized Greek of Ephesus or Sardes who became the first eastern consul.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (completed in 135) by Celsus' son, Gaius Julius Aquila ([[consul]], 110 AD). The library was built to store 12,000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus.

Private or personal libraries made up of written books (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in archives) appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. The celebrated book collectors of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] were listed in the late 2nd century in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]''. All these libraries were Greek. The cultivated Hellenized diners in ''Deipnosophistae'' pass over the libraries of Rome in silence. By the time of Augustus, there were public libraries near the forums of Rome. There were libraries in the [[Porticus Octaviae]] near the [[Theatre of Marcellus]], in the temple of Apollo Palatinus, and in the Bibliotheca Ulpiana in the [[Trajan's Forum|Forum of Trajan]]. The state archives were kept in a structure on the slope between the [[Roman Forum]] and the [[Capitoline Hill]].

Private libraries appeared during the late republic: [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases (''armaria'') of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: "by now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house (''[[domus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De tranquillitate animi'' ix.4–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries were amenities suited to a villa, such as Cicero's at Tusculum, [[Gaius Maecenas|Maecenas]]'s several villas, or Pliny the Younger's, all described in surviving letters. At the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], apparently the villa of Caesar's father-in-law, the Greek library has been partly preserved in volcanic ash; archaeologists speculate that a Latin library, kept separate from the Greek one, may await discovery at the site.

[[File:Ephesus Celsus Library Façade.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of the [[Library of Celsus]] at Ephesus]]
In the West, the first public libraries were established under the [[Roman Empire]] as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of his predecessor. Rome's first public library was established by [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]]. Pollio was a lieutenant of [[Julius Caesar]] and one of his most ardent supporters. After his military victory in Illyria, Pollio felt he had enough fame and fortune to create what Julius Caesar had sought for a long time: a public library to increase the prestige of Rome and rival the one in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, L. (2001). Libraries in the ancient world. New Haven: Yale University Press; Ewald, L. A. (2004). Library Culture in Ancient Rome, 100 B.C. – A.D. 400. Kentucky Libraries, 68(1), 9–11;Buchanan, S. (2012). Designing the Research Commons: Classical Models for School Libraries. School Libraries Worldwide, 18(1), 56–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollios's library, the ''Anla Libertatis'',&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, 2004, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; which was housed in the ''Atrium Libertatis'', was centrally located near the [[Roman Forum|Forum Romanum]]. It was the first to employ an architectural design that separated works into Greek and Latin. All subsequent Roman public libraries will have this design.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of Rome's civil wars following the death of [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] in 30 BC, the Emperor Augustus sought to reconstruct many of Rome's damaged buildings. During this construction, Augustus created two more public libraries. The first was the library of the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine, often called the [[Bibliotheca Palatina|Palatine library]], and the second was the library of the ''Porticus of Octaviae''.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p. 81; Buchanan, 2012, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more libraries were added by the [[Tiberius|Emperor Tiberius]] on Palatine Hill and one by Vespasian after 70 AD. Vespasian's library was constructed in the [[Imperial fora|Forum of Vespasian]], also known as the ''Forum of Peace'', and became one of Rome's principal libraries. The ''Bibliotheca Pacis'' was built along the traditional model and had two large halls with rooms for Greek and Latin libraries containing the works of Galen and Lucius Aelius.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p.84; Buchanan, 2012, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best preserved was the ancient [[Ulpian Library]] built by the Emperor Trajan. Completed in 112/113, the Ulpian Library was part of Trajan's Forum built on the Capitoline Hill. Trajan's Column separated the Greek and Latin rooms which faced each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, 2004, p.10; Buchanan, 2012, p.62; Casson, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was approximately fifty feet high with the peak of the roof reaching almost seventy feet.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, G. W. (2008). ''Tiberius and the Libraries: Public Book Collections and Library Buildings in the Early Roman Empire''. Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record, 43, 247–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Greek libraries, readers had direct access to the scrolls, which were kept on shelves built into the walls of a large room. Reading or copying was normally done in the room itself. The surviving records give only a few instances of lending features. Most of the large [[Thermae|Roman baths]] were also cultural centres, built from the start with a library, a two-room arrangement with one room for Greek and one for Latin texts.

Libraries were filled with [[scroll|parchment scrolls]] as at [[Library of Pergamum]] and on [[papyrus]] scrolls as at [[Alexandria]]: the export of prepared writing materials was a staple of commerce. There were a few institutional or royal libraries which were open to an educated public (such as the Serapeum collection of the [[Library of Alexandria]], once the largest [[List of libraries in the ancient world|library in the ancient world]]),&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"/&gt; but on the whole collections were private. In those rare cases where it was possible for a scholar to consult library books, there seems to have been no direct access to the stacks. In all recorded cases, the books were kept in a relatively small room where the staff went to get them for the readers, who had to consult them in an adjoining hall or covered walkway. Most of the works in catalogs were of a religious nature, such as volumes of the Bible or religious service books. "In a number of cases the library was entirely theological and liturgical, and in the greater part of the libraries the non-ecclesiastical content did not reach one third of the total"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beddie, J. (1930). The Ancient Classics in the Mediaeval Libraries. ''Speculum'', 5(1), 3–20. {{doi|10.2307/2846353}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these types of works, in some libraries during that time Plato was especially popular. In the early Middle Ages, Aristotle was more popular. Additionally, there was quite a bit of censoring within libraries of the time; many works that were "scientific and metaphysical" were not included in the majority of libraries during that time period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Latin authors were better represented within library holdings and Roman works were less represented. Cicero was also an especially popular author along with the histories of Sallust.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, Virgil was universally represented at most of the medieval libraries of the time. One of the most popular was Ovid, mentioned by approximately twenty French catalogues and nearly thirty German ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Surprisingly, old Roman textbooks on grammar were still being used at that time.

[[Han Chinese]] scholar [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] established the first library classification system during the [[Han dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Late Antiquity===
[[File:Bibl. Malatestiana 3.jpg|thumb|[[Malatestiana Library]] of [[Cesena]], the first [[Europe]]an civic library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stradavinisaporifc.it/cesena.asp |title=Stradavinisaporifc.it |publisher=Stradavinisaporifc.it |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the Late Antiquity and Middle Ages periods, there was no Rome of the kind that ruled the Mediterranean for centuries and spawned the culture that produced twenty-eight public libraries in the ''urbs Roma''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Bischoff|Bischoff, B.]] and [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Gorman, M.]] (1994). ''Manuscripts and libraries in the age of Charlemagne''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The empire had been divided then later re-united again under [[Constantine the Great]] who moved the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330 AD to the city of Byzantium which was renamed [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, K. K. (2004). ''The history of the library in Western civilization''. New Castle, Del.: Oak Knoll Press, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman intellectual culture that flourished in ancient times was undergoing a transformation as the academic world moved from laymen to Christian clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; As the West crumbled, books and libraries flourished and flowed east toward the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; There, four different types of libraries were established: imperial, patriarchal, monastic, and private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papademetriou | first1 = G. C. | year = 2000 | title = The Patriarchal libraries of Constantinople | url = | journal = Greek Orthodox Theological Review | volume = 45 | issue = 1–4| pages = 171–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each had its own purpose and, as a result, their survival varied.

Christianity was a new force in Europe and many of the faithful saw Hellenistic culture as pagan. As such, many classical Greek works, written on scrolls, were left to decay as only Christian texts were thought fit for preservation in a codex, the progenitor of the modern book.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2011). ''Books: A living history''. London: Thames and Hudson, pp.&amp;nbps;35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;   In the East, however, this was not the case as many of these classical Greek and Roman texts were copied.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; "[F]ormerly paper was rare and expensive, so every spare page of available books was pressed into use. Thus a seventeenth-century edition of the Ignatian epistles, in Mar Saba, had copied onto its last pages, probably in the early eighteenth century, a passage allegedly from the letters of Clement of Alexandria".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. (1960). Monasteries and Their Manuscripts. Archaeology, 13(3), 172–177. {{JSTOR|41663782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old manuscripts were also used to bind new books because of the costs associated with paper and also because of the scarcity of new paper.

In Byzantium, much of this work devoted to preserving Hellenistic thought in codex form was performed in [[scriptorium]]s by monks.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, H. A. (2010). The genesis of monastic libraries. ''[[Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record]]'', 45(3), 320–332, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; While '''monastic library''' scriptoriums flourished throughout the East and West, the rules governing them were generally the same.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009; Peterson, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Barren and sun-lit rooms (because candles were a source of fire) were major features of the scriptorium that was both a model of production and monastic piety.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, pp. 36, −38&lt;/ref&gt; Monks scribbled away for hours a day, interrupted only by meals and prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; With such production, medieval monasteries began to accumulate large libraries. These libraries were devoted solely to the education of the monks and were seen as essential to their spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 2010, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of these texts that were produced were Christian in nature, many monastic leaders saw common virtues in the Greek classics. As a result, many of these Greek works were copied, and thus saved, in monastic scriptoriums.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 2010, pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt;

When Europe passed into the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Byzantine scriptoriums laboriously preserved Greco-Roman classics. As a result, Byzantium revived Classical models of education and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J.W. (1957). The medieval library. New York: Hafner Publishing Co., p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Imperial Library of Constantinople]] was an important depository of ancient knowledge. Constantine himself wanted such a library but his short rule denied him the ability to see his vision to fruition. His son [[Constantius II]] made this dream a reality and created an '''imperial library''' in a portico of the royal palace.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1957, p. 312"&gt;Thompson, 1957, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; He ruled for 24 years and accelerated the development of the library and the intellectual culture that came with such a vast accumulation of books.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantius II appointed [[Themistius]], a pagan philosopher and teacher, as chief architect of this library building program. Themistius set about a bold program to create an imperial public library that would be the centerpiece of the new intellectual capital of [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoikos, 2007, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Classical authors such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Isocrates]], [[Thucydides]], [[Homer]], and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] were sought. Themeistius hired calligraphers and craftsman to produce the actual codices. He also appointed educators and created a university-like school centered around the library.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Constantius II, [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]], a bibliophile intellectual, ruled briefly for less than three years. Despite this, he had a profound impact on the imperial library and sought both Christian and pagan books for its collections.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1957, p. 312"/&gt; Later, the [[Valens|Emperor Valens]] hired Greek and Latin scribes full-time with funds from the royal treasury to copy and repair manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, pp. 312–313&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height in the 5th century, the Imperial Library of [[Constantinople]] had 120,000 volumes and was the largest library in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; A fire in 477 consumed the entire library but it was rebuilt only to be burned again in 726, 1204, and in 1453 when [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillerbrand|first1=Hans J.|title=On Book Burnings and Book Burners: Reflections on the Power (and Powerlessness) of Ideas|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|date=2006|volume=74|issue=3|pages=593–614|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfj117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patriarchal libraries''' fared no better, and sometimes worse, than the Imperial Library. The Library of the Patriarchate of Constantinople was founded most likely during the reign of Constantine the Great in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; As a theological library, it was known to have employed a [[library classification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; It also served as a repository of several [[ecumenical council]]s such as the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], [[Council of Ephesus]], and the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. The library, which employed a librarian and assistants, may have been originally located in the Patriarch's official residence before it was moved to the Thomaites Triclinus in the 7th century. While much is not known about the actual library itself, it is known that many of its contents were subject to destruction as religious in-fighting ultimately resulted in [[book burning]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, small '''private libraries''' existed. Many of these were owned by church members and the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p.429&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers also were known to have small personal libraries as well as wealthy bibliophiles who could afford the highly ornate books of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, pp.313–314&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in the 6th century, at the close of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina|Alexandria]]. [[Cassiodorus]], minister to Theodoric, established a monastery at Vivarium in the toe of Italy (modern Calabria) with a library where he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus not only collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of reading and methods for copying texts accurately. In the end, however, the library at Vivarium was dispersed and lost within a century.

Through [[Origen]] and especially the scholarly presbyter [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], an avid collector of books of Scripture, the theological school of Caesarea won a reputation for having the [[Theological Library of Caesarea Maritima|most extensive ecclesiastical library of the time]], containing more than 30,000 manuscripts: [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]], [[Jerome]], and others came and studied there.

===Islamic lands===
[[File:Chinguetti-biblio.jpg|thumb|Inside a Qur'anic Library in [[Chinguetti]], Mauritania]]
By the 8th century, first [[Iran]]ians and then [[Arabs]] had imported the craft of [[papermaking]] from China, with a [[paper mill]] already at work in [[Baghdad]] in 794. Early paper was called bagdatikos, meaning "from Baghdad", because it was introduced to the west mainly by this city.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. (2009). The library : an illustrated history. New York, NY : [[Skyhorse Pub.]] ; Chicago : ALA Editions, 2009. p.&amp;nbps;57&lt;/ref&gt; By the 9th century, [[Public library|public libraries]] started to appear in many Islamic cities. They were called "house of knowledge" or ''dar al-'ilm''. They were each endowed by [[Islam]]ic sects with the purpose of representing their tenets as well as promoting the dissemination of secular knowledge. The 9th-century [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Caliphate|Caliph]] [[al-Mutawakkil]] of [[Iraq]], ordered the construction of a "zawiyat qurra"&amp;nbsp;– an enclosure for readers which was "lavishly furnished and equipped". In [[Shiraz]], Adhud al-Daula (d. 983) set up a library, described by the medieval historian, [[al-Muqaddasi]], as "a complex of buildings surrounded by gardens with lakes and waterways. The buildings were topped with domes, and comprised an upper and a lower story with a total, according to the chief official, of 360 rooms.... In each [[Departmentalization|department]], [[Library catalog|catalogues]] were placed on a shelf... the rooms were furnished with carpets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Al-Muqaddasi: Ahsan al-Taqasim |editor=Goeje, M. J. de |year=1906 |encyclopedia=Bibliotheca geographorum Arabicorum |language=Arabic |volume=III |publisher=E. J. Brill |location=Leiden |pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries often employed translators and copyists in large numbers, in order to render into [[Arabic]] the bulk of the available [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Roman and [[Sanskrit]] non-fiction and the classics of literature.

Organization was a strength of Islamic Libraries during the Golden Age (7th–14th century). In this period, books were organized by subject.  Within the subject, the materials were further organized by when the libraries gained the item, not by last name of the author or the title of the book. Also, Islamic libraries may be the first to have implemented a catalogue of owned materials. The content of a bookshelf was recorded on paper and attached to the end of shelf.
Arab-Islamic people also were very favorable of public knowledge. Public libraries were very popular along with mosque, private, and academic libraries. Instead of being available to the elite of society, such as caliphs and princes, information was something that was offered to everyone.  Some of the libraries were said to let patrons check out up to 200 items. These buildings were also made for comfort of the readers and information seekers. It was said that the rooms had carpets for sitting and reading comfortably. Also, openings such as doors and windows were secured closed as to protect patrons against cold drafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elayyan|first1=Ribhi Mustafa|title=The history of the Arabic-Islamic Libraries: 7th to 14th Centuries|journal=International Library Review|date=1990|volume=22|issue=2|pages=119–135|doi=10.1016/0020-7837(90)90014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flowering of Islamic learning ceased centuries later when learning began declining in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], after many of these libraries were destroyed by [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasions]]. Others were victim of wars and religious strife in the Islamic world. However, a few examples of these medieval libraries, such as the libraries of [[Chinguetti]] in [[West Africa]], remain intact and relatively unchanged. Another ancient library from this period which is still operational and expanding is the [[Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi]] in the Iranian city of [[Mashhad]], which has been operating for more than six centuries.

The contents of these Islamic libraries were copied by Christian monks in Muslim/Christian border areas, particularly Spain and Sicily. From there they eventually made their way into other parts of Christian [[Europe]]. These copies joined works that had been preserved directly by Christian monks from Greek and Roman originals, as well as copies Western Christian monks made of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] works. The resulting conglomerate libraries are the basis of every modern library today.

[[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scriptures]], educational materials, and histories were stored in libraries in pre-modern [[Southeast Asia]]. In [[Myanmar|Burma]], a royal library called the [[Pitakataik]] was legendarily founded by King [[Anawrahta]];&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zoq_TtEN54IC&amp;pg=PA29 International dictionary of library histories]'', 29&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century, British envoy [[Michael Symes (diplomat)|Michael Symes]], on visiting this library, wrote that "it is not improbable that his Birman majesty may possess a more numerous library than any potentate, from the banks of the Danube to the borders of China". In Thailand, libraries called [[ho trai]] were built throughout the country, usually on stilts above a pond to prevent bugs from eating at the books.

====Islam====
[[File:Flickr - dlisbona - Old Koran manuscript, Alexandria library.jpg|thumb|Qur'an manuscript on display at the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
The centrality of the [[Quran|Qurʾān]] as the prototype of the written word in [[Islam]] bears significantly on the role of books within its intellectual tradition and educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nasr |first1=Seyyed Hossein |year=1992 |title=Oral Transmission and The Book in Islamic Education: The Spoken and The Written Word |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1093/jis/3.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early impulse in Islam was to manage reports of events, key figures and their sayings and actions. Thus, "the onus of being the last '[[People of the Book]]' engendered an ethos of [librarianship]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nanji |first1=Azim |editor1-first=Hermann |editor1-last=Landolt |editor2-first=Samira |editor2-last=Sheikh |editor3-first=Kutub |editor3-last=Kassam |title=An Anthology of Ismaili Literature: A Shi'i Vision of Islam |year=2008 |publisher=IB Tauris |location=London |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; early on and the establishment of important book repositories throughout the Muslim world has occurred ever since.

Upon the spread of Islam, libraries in [[Islamic Golden Age|newly Islamic lands]] knew a brief period of expansion in the Middle East, [[North Africa]], [[Sicily]], and [[Spain]]. Like the Christian libraries, they mostly contained books which were made of [[paper]], and took a [[codex]] or modern form instead of scrolls; they could be found in mosques, private homes, and universities, from [[Timbuktu]] to [[Afghanistan]] and modern day [[Pakistan]]. In [[Aleppo]], for example, the largest and probably the oldest mosque library, the Sufiya, located at the city's Grand Umayyad Mosque, contained a large book collection of which 10,000 volumes were reportedly bequeathed by the city's most famous ruler, Prince Sayf al-Dawla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sibai |first=Mohamed Makki |title=Mosque libraries: An Historical Study |year=1987 |publisher=Mansell Publishing Limited |page=71 |isbn=978-0-7201-1896-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn al-Nadim]]'s bibliography ''Fihrist'' demonstrates the devotion of medieval Muslim scholars to books and reliable sources; it contains a description of thousands of books circulating in the Islamic world circa 1000, including an entire section for books about the doctrines of other religions. Modern Islamic libraries for the most part do not hold these antique books; many were lost, [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destroyed by Mongols]],&lt;ref&gt;Chief among the libraries destroyed by the Mongol hordes was that of the Shia Ismaili Muslim community who occupied a network of mountain fortresses – lead from the castle of Alamut – beginning from the end of the eleventh century to about 1256. "The Fatimids and their successors at Alamut were great lovers and patrons of books, and their vast libraries attracted scholars of every creed from far and wide. The Imam al-Hakim even provided ink, pens, paper, and inkstands free of charge for all who sought learning in the 'House of Knowledge' (dār al-ʿilm). We can only imagine the horror the Ismailis would have felt when they witnessed the destruction of the literary legacy they had so painstakingly fostered. Al-Maqrizi (d.845/1442) describes how great hills of ashes were formed when the slaves and maids of the Luwata Berber tribe burned the Fatimid books. As an act of further desecration, they used the precious bindings of the volumes to make sandals for their feet. Similarly, Juwayni exults at torching the Ismaili library of Alamut, "the fame of which", he adds, "had spread throughout the world".

===European Middle Ages===
[[File:13-11-02-olb-by-RalfR-03.jpg|thumb|Science library of Upper Lusatia in Görlitz, Germany]]
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], monastery libraries developed, such as the important one at the [[Monte Cassino|Abbey of Montecassino]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crossingitaly.net/travel/936/montecassino-one-of-the-most-important-libraries-in-the-world/ |title=Montecassino, one of the most important libraries in the world |website=crossingitaly.net |year=2012 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books were usually [[chained library|chained to the shelves]], reflecting the fact that [[manuscript]]s, which were created via the labour-intensive process of hand copying, were valuable possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jM-OY0LCHCEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Chained+libraries#v=onepage&amp;q=Chained%20libraries&amp;f=false |title=The Chained Library |first=Burnett Hillman |last=Streeter |authorlink=Burnett Hillman Streeter |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2012|isbn=9781108027892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hand-copying was often accomplished by travelling monks who made the treks to the sources of knowledge and illumination they sought for learning or to copy the manuscripts held by other monasteries for their own monastic libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Books: A Living History |last=Lyons |first=Martyn |publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum |year=2011 |isbn= |location=Los Angeles, CA |pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this protectiveness, many libraries loaned books if provided with security deposits (usually money or a book of equal value). Lending was a means by which books could be copied and spread. In 1212, the council of Paris condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books, reminding them that lending is "one of the chief works of mercy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Putnam |first=Geo. Haven |title=Books and Their Makers in the Middle Ages |year=1962 |publisher=Hillary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early libraries located in monastic [[cloister]]s and associated with [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] were collections of lecterns with books chained to them. Shelves built above and between back-to-back lecterns were the beginning of [[Bookcase|bookpresses]]. The chain was attached at the fore-edge of a book rather than to its spine. Book presses came to be arranged in [[carrel desk|carrels]] (perpendicular to the walls and therefore to the windows) in order to maximize lighting, with low bookcases in front of the windows. This "stall system" (i.e. fixed bookcases perpendicular to exterior walls pierced by closely spaced windows) was characteristic of English institutional libraries. In European libraries, bookcases were arranged parallel to and against the walls. This "wall system" was first introduced on a large scale in Spain's [[El Escorial]].

Also, in [[Eastern Christianity]] monastery libraries kept important manuscripts. The most important of them were the ones in the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]] for [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and the library of the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]] for the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]].

===Renaissance===
[[File:Biblioteca medicea laurenziana interno 01.JPG|thumb|Reading room of the [[Laurentian Library]]]]
From the 15th century in central and northern Italy, libraries of [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and their enlightened patrons provided a nucleus around which an "[[academy]]" of scholars congregated in each Italian city of consequence. [[Malatesta Novello]], [[Signoria|lord]] of [[Cesena]], founded the [[Malatestiana Library]]. [[Cosimo de' Medici]] in [[Florence]] established his own collection, which formed the basis of the [[Laurentian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-magazine.com/libraries.html Survivor: the History of the Library], history-magazine.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, the papal collections were brought together by [[Pope Nicholas V]], in separate Greek and Latin libraries, and housed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], who consigned the [[Vatican Library|Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana]] to the care of his librarian, the humanist [[Bartolomeo Platina]] in February 1475.&lt;ref&gt;This section on Roman Renaissance libraries follows Kenneth M. Setton, "From Medieval to Modern Library" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''104'''.4, Dedication of the APS Library Hall, Autumn General Meeting, November 1959 (August 1960:371–390) p. 372 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] bisected Bramante's [[Cortile del Belvedere]] with a cross-wing to house the Apostolic Library in suitable magnificence. The 16th and 17th centuries saw other privately endowed libraries assembled in Rome: the [[Biblioteca Vallicelliana|Vallicelliana]], formed from the books of Saint [[Philip Neri|Filippo Neri]], with other distinguished libraries such as that of [[Caesar Baronius|Cesare Baronio]], the [[Biblioteca Angelica]] founded by the Augustinian [[Angelo Rocca]], which was the only truly public library in Counter-Reformation Rome; the Biblioteca Alessandrina with which [[Pope Alexander VII]] endowed the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]; the [[Biblioteca Casanatense]] of the Cardinal [[Girolamo Casanata]]; and finally the Biblioteca Corsiniana founded by the bibliophile [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII Corsini]] and his nephew Cardinal Neri Corsini, still housed in Palazzo Corsini in via della Lungara. The [[Republic of Venice]] patronized the foundation of the [[Biblioteca Marciana]], based on the library of Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]]. In Milan, Cardinal [[Federico Borromeo]] founded the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].

This trend soon spread outside of Italy, for example [[Louis III, Elector Palatine]] founded the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] of [[Heidelberg]].

These libraries don't have as many volumes as the modern libraries. However, they keep many valuable manuscripts of Greek, Latin, and Biblical works.

[[Tian Yi Ge|Tianyi Chamber]], founded in 1561 by Fan Qin during the [[Ming dynasty]], is the oldest existing library in China. In its heyday, it boasted a collection of 70,000 volumes of antique books.

===Enlightenment era libraries===
[[File:Thomas Bodley.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Thomas Bodley]] founded the [[Bodleian Library]] in 1602 as an early public library.]]

At the start of the 18th century, libraries were becoming increasingly public and were more frequently lending libraries. The 18th century saw the switch from closed parochial libraries to lending libraries. Before this time, public libraries were parochial in nature and libraries frequently chained their books to desks.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966) ''Early Public Libraries: a history of public libraries in Great Britain before 1850'' London: Library Association; p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries also were not uniformly open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Predeek, Albert (1947) ''A History of Libraries in Great Britain and North America''. Chicago: American Library Association; p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[British Museum]] existed at this time and contained over 50,000 books, the national library was not open to the public, or even to a majority of the population. Access to the Museum depended on passes, of which there was sometimes a waiting period of three to four weeks. Moreover, the library was not open to browsing. Once a pass to the library had been issued, the reader was taken on a tour of the library. Many readers complained that the tour was much too short.&lt;ref&gt;Battles, Matthew (2003) ''Library: an unquiet history''; p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subscription libraries====
{{main|Subscription library}}
[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|right|The [[British Museum]] was established in 1751 and had a library containing over 50,000 books.]]
At the start of the 19th century, there were virtually no public libraries in the sense in which we now understand the term i.e. libraries provided from public funds and freely accessible to all.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Only one important library in Britain, namely [[Chetham's Library]] in Manchester, was fully and freely accessible to the public.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"/&gt; However, there had come into being a whole network of library provision on a private or institutional basis.

The increase in secular literature at this time encouraged the spread of lending libraries, especially the commercial [[subscription library|subscription libraries]]. Many small, private book clubs evolved into subscription libraries, charging high annual fees or requiring subscribing members to purchase shares in the libraries. The materials available to subscribers tended to focus on particular subject areas, such as [[biography]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[travel]], rather than works of fiction, particularly the novel.

Unlike a [[public library]], access was often restricted to members. Some of the earliest such institutions were founded in late 17th century England, such as [[Chetham's Library]] in 1653, [[Innerpeffray Library]] in 1680, and [[Thomas Plume|Thomas Plume's Library]] in 1704. In the [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonies]], the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] was started in 1731 by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in Philadelphia.

Parochial libraries attached to Anglican parishes or Nonconformist chapels in Britain emerged in the early 18th century, and prepared the way for local public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts: 1616–1714'' (2nd ed. 1956) p 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing production and demand for fiction promoted by commercial markets led to the rise of [[circulating library|circulating libraries]], which met a need that subscription libraries did not fulfil. William Bathoe claimed that his commercial venture was "the Original Circulating library", opening doors at two locations in London in 1737.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;Raven, James. "Libraries for sociability: the advance of subscription library." The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=picture1807&gt;{{cite book |last=Feltham |first=John |authorlink=John Feltham |title=Picture of London, for 1807 |publisher=Richard Phillips |edition=8th |location=London |chapter=Circulating Libraries |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=j9MHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Circulating libraries also charged subscription fees to users and offered serious subject matter as well as the popular novels, thus the difficulty in clearly distinguishing circulating from subscription libraries.&lt;ref name=Eliot&gt;Eliot, Simon. "Circulating libraries in the Victorian age and after." The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|thumb|left|[[Załuski Library|Biblioteka Załuskich]], built in [[Warsaw]] in the mid 18th century]]
Subscription libraries were democratic in nature; created by and for communities of local subscribers who aimed to establish permanent collections of books and reading materials, rather than selling their collections annually as the circulating libraries tended to do, in order to raise funds to support their other commercial interests. Even though the subscription libraries were often founded by reading societies, committees, elected by the subscribers, chose books for the collection that were general, rather than aimed at a particular religious, political or professional group. The books selected for the collection were chosen because they would be mutually beneficial to the shareholders. The committee also selected the librarians who would manage the circulation of materials.&lt;ref name=Forster&gt;Forster, Geoffrey, and Alan Bell. "The subscription libraries and their members." The Cambridge History of Libraries in Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, there were more than 200 commercial circulating libraries open in 1800, more than twice the number of subscription and private proprietary libraries that were operating at the same time.  Many proprietors pandered to the most fashionable clientele, making much ado about the sort of shop they offered, the lush interiors, plenty of room and long hours of service.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt; "These 'libraries' would be called rental collections today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harris |first=Michael H. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0810829725 |publication-place=Metuchen, N.J |title=History of libraries in the western world |publication-date=1995|date=January 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private Subscription Libraries====
[[File:Linen Hall Library, 1888.jpg|thumb|The [[Linen Hall Library]] in Belfast was an 18th-century [[subscription library]]. Pictured in 1888, shortly before its demolition.]]
Private subscription libraries functioned in much the same manner as commercial subscription libraries, though they varied in many important ways. One of the most popular versions of the private subscription library was a gentleman's only library. Membership was restricted to the proprietors or shareholders, and ranged from a dozen or two to between four and five hundred.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liverpool [[Subscription library|Subscription Library]] was a gentlemen only library. In 1798, it was renamed the Athenaeum when it was rebuilt with a newsroom and coffeehouse. It had an entrance fee of one guinea and annual subscription of five shillings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the registers for the first twelve years provides glimpses of middle-class reading habits in a mercantile community at this period. The largest and most popular sections of the library were History, Antiquities, and Geography, with 283 titles and 6,121 borrowings, and Belles Lettres, with 238 titles and 3,313 borrowings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul.

[[File:Donald McDonald, stationer, and his Circulating Library, Gulgong, 1870.jpg|left|thumb| [[Circulating library]] and stationery shop, [[Gulgong]], Australia 1870]]
Private subscription libraries held a greater amount of control over both membership and the types of books in the library. There was almost a complete elimination of cheap fiction in the private societies.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul (1969); p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Subscription libraries prided themselves on respectability. The highest percentage of subscribers were often landed proprietors, gentry, and old professions.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, David (2008); p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  

Towards the end of the 18th century and in the first decades of the nineteenth, the need for books and general education made itself felt among social classes created by the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Raymond (1964); p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The late 18th century saw a rise in subscription libraries intended for the use of tradesmen. In 1797, there was established at Kendal what was known as the Economical Library, "designed principally for the use and instruction of the working classes".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the Artizans' library established at Birmingham in 1799. The entrance fee was 3 shillings. The subscription was 1 shilling 6 pence per quarter. This was a library of general literature. Novels, at first excluded, were afterwards admitted on condition that they did not account for more than one-tenth of the annual income.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"/&gt;

Benjamin Franklin lead the founding of the first American subscription library. In Philadelphia, Franklin formed "a club of mutual improvements".. calling themselves the "Junto", which meant a council or a combination of individuals organized for a specific purpose. Because the men in this club had a steady income, they could afford to be apart of this club and afford to purchase books. Only some had enough to be considered a library; together they shared what they all had.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=1602397066|location=|pages=145-147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National libraries===
{{main|National library}}
[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] is but one of the treasures made available in the [[British Museum]] upon its establishment in 1753.]]
The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state. This era is termed the "golden age of libraries", with millions of printed books available and widespread interest growing in both national and classical literature. National libraries would eventually become objects of pride in that same spirit, most Europeans considered themselves as belonging to a nation first and a religion second. Wars of religion would give way to wars of nationalism, as fierce and widespread as ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would become a major turning point for many libraries and their collections. 

One of the first plans for a national library was devised by the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[John Dee]], who in 1556 presented [[Mary I of England]] with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library, but his proposal was not taken up.&lt;ref&gt;Fell-Smith, Charlotte (1909) ''John Dee: 1527–1608''. London: Constable and Company [http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/ Available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true national library was founded in 1753 as part of the [[British Museum]].

Sloane's collection included some 40,000 printed books and 7,000 [[manuscript]]s, as well as [[Old master print|prints]] and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx|title=General history|website=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Museum Act 1753]] also incorporated the [[Cotton library]] and the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Harleian library]].

In France, the first national library was the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], which evolved from its origin as a royal library founded at the [[Louvre Palace]] by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1368. The appointment of [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]] as librarian in the 17th century, initiated a period of development that made it the largest and richest collection of books in the world.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt; The library opened to the public in 1692, under the administration of [[Camille le Tellier de Louvois|Abbé Louvois]], Minister Louvois's son. Abbé Louvois was succeeded by the [[Jérôme Bignon|Abbé Bignon]], or Bignon II as he was termed, who instituted a complete reform of the library's system. Catalogues were made, which appeared from 1739 to 1753 in 11 volumes. The collections increased steadily by purchase and gift to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], at which time it was in grave danger of partial or total destruction, but owing to the activities of Antoine-Augustin Renouard and [[Joseph Van Praet]] it suffered no injury.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

The library's collections swelled to over 300,000 volumes during the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|radical phase]] of the [[French Revolution]], when the private libraries of aristocrats and clergy were seized. After the establishment of the [[French First Republic]] in September 1792, "the Assembly declared the ''Bibliotheque du Roi'' to be national property and the institution was renamed the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]''. After four centuries of control by the Crown, this great library now became the property of the French people."&lt;ref name=priebe&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Paul M. |last1=Priebe|title=From Bibliothèque du Roi to Bibliothèque Nationale: The Creation of a State Library, 1789–1793|journal= The Journal of Library History (1974–1987)|volume= 17|issue= 4 |pages=389–408|date= 1982|jstor=25541320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern public library===
{{main|Public library}}
[[File:James Silk Buckingham by Clara S. Lane.jpg|thumb|[[James Silk Buckingham]] led the campaign for public libraries in the mid 19th century.]]
Although by the mid-19th century, England could claim 274 [[subscription library|subscription libraries]] and Scotland, 266, the foundation of the modern public library system in Britain is the [[Public Libraries Act 1850]]. The Act first gave local [[municipal borough|boroughs]] the power to establish free public libraries and was the first legislative step toward the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature. In the 1830s, at the height of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. The [[Capitalism|Capitalist]] economic model had created a significant amount of free time for workers, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders.&lt;ref&gt;McMenemy (2009), pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm |title=History of the Public Libraries Act |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316170538/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm |archivedate=16 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, and against government opposition, [[James Silk Buckingham]], MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the [[temperance movement]], was able to secure the Chair of the [[Parliamentary select committees of the United Kingdom|Select Committee]] which would examine "the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom" and propose solutions. [[Francis Place]], a campaigner for the working class, agreed that, "The establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford".&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee on inquiry into drunkenness, ''Report'' (1834)&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on [[William Ewart (British politician)|William Ewart]] MP and [[Joseph Brotherton]] MP, who introduced a bill which would "[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a ½d for the establishment of museums".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly &amp; Kelly (1977), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This became the [[Museums Act 1845]].

The advocacy of Ewart and Brotherton then succeeded in having a select committee set up to consider public library provision. The Report argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the Committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Minto (1932) chapters 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murison (1971) chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansard (1850) Col. 848&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill passed through [[Parliament]] as most MPs felt that public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, and that the greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower [[crime statistics|crime rates]].

The earliest example in England of a library to be endowed for the benefit of users who were not members of an institution such as a cathedral or college was the [[Francis Trigge Chained Library]] in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], established in 1598. The library still exists and can justifiably claim to be the forerunner of later public library systems. The beginning of the modern, free, open access libraries really got its start in the UK in 1847. [[Parliament]] appointed a committee, led by William Ewart, on Public Libraries to consider the necessity of establishing libraries through the nation: In 1849, their report noted the poor condition of library service, it recommended the establishment of free public libraries all over the country, and it led to the Public Libraries Act in 1850, which allowed all cities with populations exceeding 10,000 to levy taxes for the support of public libraries.

Norwich was the eleventh library to open, in 1857, after [[Winchester]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Bolton]], [[Kidderminster]], [[Cambridge]], [[Birkenhead]], and [[Sheffield]].

Another important act was the [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Education Act 1870]], which increased literacy and thereby the demand for libraries. By 1877, more than 75 cities had established free libraries, and by 1900 the number had reached 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Michael H. |title=The History of Libraries in the Western World |year=1984 |location=London |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-1666-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finally marks the start of the public library as we know it. And these acts influenced similar laws in other countries, such as the US. The first tax-supported public library in the United States was [[Peterborough]], [[New Hampshire]] (1833) first supported by state funds then an "Act Providing for the Establishment of Public Libraries" in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shera |first=Jesse H. |title=Foundations of the Public Library: The Origins of the Public Library Movement in New England, 1629–1855 |year=1949 |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expansion====
[[File:Andrew Carnegie at Skibo 1914 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Carnegie]] played an important role in financing public libraries across the [[English-speaking world]].]]
[[The American School Library]] (1839) was an early frontier traveling library in the [[United States]]. The year 1876 is key in the history of librarianship in the United States. The [[American Library Association]] was formed on October 6,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/node/530/|title=ALA Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''The [[American Library Journal]]'', [[Melvil Dewey]] published his [[Dewey Decimal Classification|decimal-based system]] of classification, and the United States Bureau of Education published its report, "Public libraries in the United States of America; their history, condition, and management."  During the post-Civil War years, there was a rise in the establishment of public libraries, a movement led chiefly by newly formed [[Women's club (United States)|women's clubs]]. They contributed their own collections of books, conducted lengthy fund raising campaigns for buildings, and lobbied within their communities for financial support for libraries, as well as with legislatures and the [[Carnegie library]] Endowment founded in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Paula D. Watson, "Founding Mothers: The Contribution of Woman's Organizations to Public Library Development in the United States", ''Library Quarterly'', Vol. 64, Issue 3, 1994, p.236&lt;/ref&gt;  They led the establishment of 75–80 percent of the libraries in communities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Teva Scheer, "The "Praxis" Side of the Equation: Club Women and American Public Administration", ''Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis'', Vol. 24, Issue 3, 2002, p.525&lt;/ref&gt;

Philanthropists and businessmen, including John Passmore Edwards, [[Henry Tate]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]], helped to increase the number of public libraries from the late 19th century. Carnegie alone built over 2000 libraries in the US, 660 [[Carnegie library|Carnegie Libraries]] in Britain, in addition to many more in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Theodore |title=Carnegie Libraries across America |publisher=Preservation Press |location=Washington |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-471-14422-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie also funded academic libraries, favoring small schools and schools with African American students.  "In 1899, Pennsylvania State College became the first college to receive Carnegie funding ($150,000) and their library was constructed in 1903."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ryan |first1=S |title='An Idea Likely Too Big': John B.

==Types==
Many institutions make a distinction between a circulating or [[lending library]], where materials are expected and intended to be loaned to patrons, institutions, or other libraries, and a reference library where material is not lent out. Travelling libraries, such as the early horseback libraries of eastern Kentucky&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Amazing Story of Kentucky's Horseback Librarians (10 Photos)|url=http://archiveproject.com/the-horseback-librarians-of-eastern-kentucky-10-photos|website=Archive Project|accessdate=19 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bookmobiles]], are generally of the lending type. Modern libraries are often a mixture of both, containing a general collection for circulation, and a reference collection which is restricted to the library premises. Also, increasingly, digital collections enable broader access to material that may not circulate in print, and enables libraries to expand their collections even without building a larger facility.

===Academic libraries===
{{Main|Academic library}}

[[File:Cmglee London Maughan Library reading room.jpg|thumb|The round reading room of [[Maughan Library]], the main university library of [[King's College London]]]]
Academic libraries are generally located on college and university campuses and primarily serve the students and faculty of that and other academic institutions. Some academic libraries, especially those at public institutions, are accessible to members of the general public in whole or in part.

[[File:Egyetemi Könyvtár4.JPG|thumb|left|The University Library in [[Budapest]]]]
Academic libraries are libraries that are hosted in post-secondary educational institutions, such as colleges and universities. Their main function are to provide support in research and resource linkage for students and faculty of the educational institution. Specific course-related resources are usually provided by the library, such as copies of textbooks and article readings held on 'reserve' (meaning that they are loaned out only on a short-term basis, usually a matter of hours). Some academic libraries provide resources not usually associated with libraries, such as the ability to check out laptop computers, web cameras, or scientific calculators.

Academic libraries offer workshops and courses outside of formal, graded coursework, which are meant to provide students with the tools necessary to succeed in their programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.library.utoronto.ca/workshops/|title=St. George Library Workshops|website=utoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workshops may include help with citations, effective search techniques, journal databases, and electronic citation software. These workshops provide students with skills that can help them achieve success in their academic careers (and often, in their future occupations), which they may not learn inside the classroom.

[[File:Robartslibrary.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Robarts Library]] at the [[University of Toronto]], Canada.]]
The academic library provides a quiet study space for students on campus; it may also provide group study space, such as meeting rooms. In North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, academic libraries are becoming increasingly digitally oriented. The library provides a "gateway" for students and researchers to access various resources, both print/physical and digital.&lt;ref&gt;Dowler, Lawrence (1997). ''Gateways to knowledge: the role of academic libraries in teaching, learning, and research''. {{ISBN|0-262-04159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic institutions are subscribing to electronic journals databases, providing research and scholarly writing software, and usually provide computer workstations or computer labs for students to access journals, library search databases and portals, institutional electronic resources, Internet access, and course- or task-related software (i.e. word processing and spreadsheet software). Some academic libraries take on new roles, for instance, acting as an electronic repository for institutional scholarly research and academic knowledge, such as the collection and curation of digital copies of students' theses and dissertations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/anunobi-okoye.htm |title=The Role of Academic Libraries in Universal Access to Print and Electronic Resources in the Developing Countries, Chinwe V.

===Children's libraries===
[[File:Children. Children's Library in N.D.G BAnQ Vieux-Montréal P48S1P08742.jpg|thumb|left|A children's library in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada in 1943]]
[[Children's libraries]] are special collections of books intended for juvenile readers and usually kept in separate rooms of general public libraries. Some children's libraries have entire floors or wings dedicated to them in bigger libraries while smaller ones may have a separate room or area for children. They are an educational agency seeking to acquaint the young with the world's literature and to cultivate a love for reading. Their work supplements that of the public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Americana|last=Modell |first=David A. |wstitle=Children's Libraries|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Services commonly provided by public libraries may include storytelling sessions for infants, toddlers, preschool children, or after-school programs, all with an intention of developing early literacy skills and a love of books. One of the most popular programs offered in public libraries are summer reading programs for children, families, and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Udomisor, I., Udomisor, E., &amp; Smith, E. (2013). Management of Communication Crisis in a Library and Its Influence on Productivity. In Information and Knowledge Management (Vol. 3, No. 8, pp. 13–21)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular reading program for children is PAWS TO READ or similar programs where children can read to certified therapy dogs. Since animals are a calming influence and there is no judgment, children learn confidence and a love of reading. Many states have these types of programs: parents need simply ask their librarian to see if it is available at their local library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paws to read|url=http://www.readingpaws.org/READingPaws/Welcome.html|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National libraries===
[[File:National Library of Wales.jpg|thumb|[[National Library of Wales]]]]
{{Main|National library}}
A [[national library|national or state library]] serves as a national repository of information, and has the right of [[legal deposit]], which is a legal requirement that publishers in the country need to deposit a copy of each publication with the library. Unlike a public library, a national library rarely allows citizens to borrow books. Often, their collections include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works. There are wider definitions of a national library, putting less emphasis on the [[Institutional repository|repository]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Line, Maurice B.; Line, J. (1979). "Concluding notes". ''National libraries'', Aslib, pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lor, P. J.; Sonnekus, E. A. S. (1997). [http://www.ifla.org/VII/s1/gnl/index.htm "Guidelines for Legislation for National Library Services"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813200532/http://www.ifla.org/VII/s1/gnl/index.htm |date=13 August 2006 }}, [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|IFLA]]. Retrieved on 10 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state.

Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards, and carry out projects helping them to fulfil their duties. The national libraries of Europe participate in [[European Library|The European Library]] which is a service of the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).

===Public lending libraries===
{{Main|Public library}}
[[File:Biblioteka Raczyńskich.jpg|thumb|[[Raczyński Library]], the public library of [[Poznań]], Poland]]

A public library provides services to the general public. If the library is part of a [[county]]wide library system, citizens with an active library card from around that county can use the library branches associated with the library system. A library can serve only their city, however, if they are not a member of the county public library system. Much of the materials located within a public library are available for borrowing. The library staff decides upon the number of items patrons are allowed to borrow, as well as the details of borrowing time allotted.  Typically, libraries issue [[library card]]s to community members wishing to borrow books. Often visitors to a city are able to obtain a public library card.

Many public libraries also serve as community organizations that provide free services and events to the public, such as reading groups and toddler story time. For many communities, the library is a source of connection to a vast world, obtainable knowledge and understanding, and entertainment. According to a study by the [[Pennsylvania Library Association]], public library services play a major role in fighting rising illiteracy rates among youths.&lt;ref&gt;Celano, D., &amp; Neumann, S. B. (2001). The role of public libraries in children's literacy development: An evaluation report. Pennsylvania, PA: Pennsylvania Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Public libraries are protected and funded by the public they serve.
[[File:Bates Hall - Boston Public Library.jpg|thumb|Bates Hall, the main reading room of the [[Boston Public Library]]]]

As the number of books in libraries have steadily increased since their inception, the need for compact storage and access with adequate lighting has grown. The ''[[library stack|stack system]]'' involves keeping a library's collection of books in a space separate from the reading room. This arrangement arose in the 19th century. Book stacks quickly evolved into a fairly standard form in which the [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] frameworks supporting the bookshelves also supported the floors, which often were built of translucent blocks to permit the passage of light (but were not transparent, for reasons of modesty). The introduction of [[electric light|electrical lighting]] had a huge impact on how the library [[lighting in libraries|operated]]. The use of glass floors was largely discontinued, though floors were still often composed of metal grating to allow air to circulate in multi-story stacks. As more space was needed, a method of moving shelves on tracks (compact shelving) was introduced to cut down on otherwise wasted aisle space.

[[File:ET Amhara asv2018-02 img120 Awra Amba.jpg|thumb|left|A community library in [[Ethiopia]].]]
[[Library 2.0]], a term coined in 2005, is the library's response to the challenge of Google and an attempt to meet the changing needs of users by using [[web 2.0]] technology. Some of the aspects of Library 2.0 include, commenting, tagging, bookmarking, discussions, use of online social networks by libraries, [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]], and [[Software widget|widgets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=L.B. |title=A Manifesto for our time |year=2007 |pages=47–9 |journal=American Libraries |volume=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by web 2.0, it is an attempt to make the library a more user-driven institution.

Despite the importance of public libraries, they are routinely having their budgets cut by state legislature. Funding has dwindled so badly that many public libraries have been forced to cut their hours and release employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jaeger |first=Paul T. |last2=Bertot |first2=John Carol |last3=Gorham |first3=Ursula |title=Wake Up the Nation: Public Libraries, Policy Making, and Political Discourse |journal=The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy |date=January 2013 |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=61–72 |doi=10.1086/668582 |jstor=10.1086/668582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reference libraries{{anchor|Reference library}}===
A reference library does not lend books and other items; instead, they must be read at the library itself. Typically, such libraries are used for research purposes, for example at a university. Some items at reference libraries may be historical and even unique. Many lending libraries contain a "reference section", which holds books, such as dictionaries, which are common reference books, and are therefore not lent out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Ehrenhaft |first2=William |last2=Howard Armstrong |first3=M.

A research library can be either a reference library, which does not lend its holdings, or a lending library, which does lend all or some of its holdings. Some extremely large or traditional research libraries are entirely reference in this sense, lending none of their materials; most academic research libraries, at least in the US and the UK, now lend books, but not periodicals or other materials. Many research libraries are attached to a parental organization and serve only members of that organization.  Examples of research libraries include the [[British Library]], the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and the [[New York Public Library Main Branch]] on 42nd Street in Manhattan, [[State Public Scientific &amp; Technological Library|State Public Scientific Technological Library of the Sibirian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spsl.nsc.ru/en/|title=SPSTL SB RAS|website=www.spsl.nsc.ru|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl|title=Our Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital libraries===
{{main article|Digital library}}

Digital libraries are libraries that house digital resources. They are defined as an organization and not a service that provide access to digital works, have a preservation responsibility to provide future access to materials, and provides these items easily and affordably.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury &amp; Foo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital Libraries and Information Access: research perspectives|last1=Chowdhury|first1=G. G.|last2=Foo|first2=C.|date=2012|publisher=Neal-Schuman|year=|isbn=9781555709143|oclc=869282690|location=Chicago|pages=2–3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a digital library implies that "a digital library uses a variety of software, networking technologies and standards to facilitate access to digital content and data to a designated user community."{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|pp=3–4}} Access to digital libraries can be influenced by several factors, either individually or together. The most common factors that influence access are: The library's content, the characteristics and information needs of the target users, the library's digital interface, the goals and objectives of the library's organizational structure, and the standards and regulations that govern library use.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=49}} Access will depend on the users ability to discover and retrieve documents that interest them and that they require, which in turn is a preservation question. Digital objects cannot be preserved passively, they must be curated by digital librarians to ensure the trust and integrity of the digital objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scholarship in the digital age: information, infrastructure, and the Internet|last=Borgman|first=Christine L.|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262026192|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=88|oclc=181028448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest considerations for digital librarians is the need to provide long-term access to their resources; to do this, there are two issues requiring watchfulness: Media failure and format obsolescence. With media failure, a particular digital item is unusable because of some sort of error or problem. A scratched CD-Rom, for example, will not display its contents correctly, but another, unscratched disk will not have that problem. Format obsolescence is when a digital format has been superseded by newer technology, and so items in the old format are unreadable and unusable. Dealing with media failure is a reactive process, because something is done only when a problem presents itself. In contrast, format obsolescence is preparatory, because changes are anticipated and solutions are sought before there is a problem.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=211}}

Future trends in digital preservation include: Transparent enterprise models for digital preservation, launch of self-preserving objects, increased flexibility in digital preservation architectures, clearly-defined metrics for comparing preservation tools, and terminology and standards interoperability in real time.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=211}}

===Special libraries===
{{Main|Special library}}All other libraries fall into the "[[special library]]" category. Many private businesses and public organizations, including hospitals, churches, museums, research laboratories, law firms, and many government departments and agencies, maintain their own libraries for the use of their employees in doing specialized research related to their work. Depending on the particular institution, special libraries may or may not be accessible to the general public or elements thereof. In more specialized institutions such as law firms and research laboratories, librarians employed in special libraries are commonly specialists in the institution's field rather than generally trained librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in specifically library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the library.

Special libraries can also include women's libraries or LGBTQ libraries, which serve the needs of women and the LGBTQ community. [[Libraries and the LGBTQ community]] have an extensive history, and there are currently many libraries, archives, and special collections devoted to preserving and helping the LGBTQ community. Women's libraries, such as the Vancouver Women's Library or the [[Women's Library]] @LSE are examples of women's libraries that offer services to women and girls and focus on women's history.

Some special libraries, such as governmental law libraries, hospital libraries, and military base libraries commonly are open to public visitors to the institution in question. Depending on the particular library and the clientele it serves, special libraries may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection. Given the highly individual nature of special libraries, visitors to a special library are often advised to check what services and restrictions apply at that particular library.

Special libraries are distinguished from [[special collections]], which are branches or parts of a library intended for rare books, manuscripts, and other special materials, though some special libraries have special collections of their own, typically related to the library's specialized subject area.

For more information on specific types of special libraries, see [[law library|law libraries]], [[medical library|medical libraries]], [[music library|music libraries]], or [[transportation libraries]].

==Organization==
[[File:HK Wan Chai Library Inside Bookcase a.jpg|thumb|Library shelves in Hong Kong, showing numbers of the classification scheme to help readers locate works in that section]]

Most libraries have materials arranged in a specified order according to a [[library classification]] system, so that items may be located quickly and collections may be browsed efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Library classification|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/library-classification|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some libraries have additional galleries beyond the public ones, where reference materials are stored. These reference stacks may be open to selected members of the public. Others require patrons to submit a "stack request", which is a request for an assistant to retrieve the material from the closed stacks: see [[List of closed stack libraries]] (in progress).

Larger libraries are often divided into departments staffed by both paraprofessionals and professional [[librarian]]s.
* Circulation (or Access Services) – Handles user accounts and the loaning/returning and shelving of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, V. &amp; Bullard, J. (2009). Circulation Services. In ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences'' (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Collection development|Collection Development]] – Orders materials and maintains materials budgets.
* Reference – Staffs a [[reference desk]] answering questions from users (using structured [[reference interview]]s), instructing users, and developing library programming. Reference may be further broken down by user groups or materials; common collections are [[children's literature]], [[Young adult fiction|young adult literature]], and [[genealogy]] materials.
* Technical Services – Works behind the scenes cataloging and processing new materials and deaccessioning [[Weeding (library)|weeded materials]].
* Stacks Maintenance – Re-shelves materials that have been returned to the library after patron use and shelves materials that have been processed by Technical Services. Stacks Maintenance also shelf reads the material in the stacks to ensure that it is in the correct library classification order.

[[File:Library card.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Browne Issue System|Card]] used by a user to sign out a book]]

Basic tasks in [[library management]] include the planning of acquisitions (which materials the library should acquire, by purchase or otherwise), library classification of acquired materials, preservation of materials (especially rare and fragile archival materials such as manuscripts), the deaccessioning of materials, patron borrowing of materials, and developing and administering library computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Library and information center management|last1=Stueart |first1=Robert |last2=Moran |first2=Barbara B. |last3=Morner |first3=Claudia J.|isbn=9781598849882|edition=Eighth|location=Santa Barbara, California|oclc=780481202 |year=2013 |publisher= Libraries Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt; More long-term issues include the planning of the construction of new libraries or extensions to existing ones, and the development and implementation of outreach services and reading-enhancement services (such as adult literacy and children's programming). Library materials like books, magazines, periodicals, CDs, etc. are managed by Dewey Decimal Classification Theory and modified Dewey Decimal Classification Theory is more practical reliable system for library materials management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhattacharjee|first1=Pijush Kanti|title=Modified Dewey Decimal Classification Theory for Library Materials Management|journal=International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology|date=2010|volume=1|issue=3|pages=292–294| url=http://www.ijimt.org/list-24-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has published several standards regarding the management of libraries through its Technical Committee 46 (TC 46),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=48750 |title=ISO – Technical committees – TC 46 – Information and documentation |publisher=ISO.org |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is focused on "libraries, documentation and information centers, publishing, archives, records management, museum documentation, indexing and abstracting services, and information science". The following is a partial list of some of them:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=48750 |title=ISO – ISO Standards – TC 46 – Information and documentation |publisher=ISO.org |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Librarians have sometimes complained&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Scott|date=Apr 2009|title=Libraries and Learning: A History of Paradigm Change|url=|journal=Portal : Libraries and the Academy|volume=9|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; that some of the library buildings which have been used to accommodate libraries have been inadequate for the demands made upon them. In general, this condition may have resulted from one or more of the following causes:
# an effort to erect a [[monument]]al building{{Vague|date=May 2012}}; most of those who commission library buildings are not librarians and their priorities may be different
# to conform it to a type of [[architecture]] unsuited to library purposes
# the appointment, often by competition, of an architect unschooled in the requirements of a library
# failure to consult with the librarian or with library experts

Much advancement has undoubtedly been made toward cooperation between architect and librarian,{{when|date=September 2012}} and many good designers have made library buildings their speciality, nevertheless it seems that the ideal type of library is not yet realized—the type so adapted to its purpose that it would be immediately recognized as such, as is the case with school buildings at the present time.{{when|date=September 2012}} This does not mean that library constructions should conform rigidly to a fixed standard of appearance and arrangement, but it does mean that the exterior should express as nearly as possible the purpose and functions of the interior.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Americana|last=Wiley |first=Edwin |wstitle=Library Architecture and Construction|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Architecture and Design.net published the web article 45+ Of the Most Majestic Libraries in the World showcasing some beautiful examples of the architecture of libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MMK|title=45+ Of The Most Majestic Libraries in the World|url=https://www.architecturendesign.net/45-of-the-most-majestic-libraries-in-the-world/|website=www.architecturendesign.net|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrons may not know how to fully use the library's resources. This can be due to some individuals' unease in approaching a staff member. Ways in which a library's content is displayed or accessed may have the most impact on use. An antiquated or clumsy search system, or staff unwilling or untrained to engage their patrons, will limit a library's usefulness. In the [[public library|public libraries]] of the United States, beginning in the 19th century, these problems drove the emergence of the [[library instruction]] movement, which advocated library user education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=S. C.|date=2003|title=The origin of library instruction in the United States, 1820–1900|journal=Research Strategies|volume=19|issue=3/4|pages=233–243|doi=10.1016/j.resstr.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early leaders was [[John Cotton Dana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattson|first=K.|date=2000|title=The librarian as secular minister to democracy: The life and ideas of John Cotton Dana|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture|volume=35|issue=4|pages=514–534|jstor=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic form of library instruction is sometimes known as [[information literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=T. E.|date=2006|title=Information literacy: Adapting to the media age|journal=Alki|volume=22|issue=1|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libraries should inform their users of what materials are available in their collections and how to access that information. Before the computer age, this was accomplished by the card [[library catalog|catalogue]]—a cabinet (or multiple cabinets) containing many drawers filled with [[index card]]s that identified books and other materials. In a large library, the card catalogue often filled a large room. The emergence of the [[Internet]], however, has led to the adoption of electronic catalogue databases (often referred to as "webcats" or as [[online public access catalog]]ues, OPACs), which allow users to search the library's holdings from any location with Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloan|first=B|last2=White|first2=M. S. B.|date=1992|title=Online public access catalogs|journal=Academic and Library Computing|volume=9|issue=2|pages=9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of catalogue maintenance is compatible with new types of libraries, such as [[digital library|digital libraries]] and [[distributed library|distributed libraries]], as well as older libraries that have been [[retrofitting|retrofitted]]. Electronic catalogue databases are criticized by some who believe that the old card catalogue system was both easier to navigate and allowed retention of information, by writing directly on the cards, that is lost in the electronic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mamis |first=Joshua |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/life_death_of_the_card_catalog/ |newspaper=New Haven Independent |title=Dewey Decimal didn't die |date=25 November 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is analogous to the debate over paper books and [[e-book]]s. While libraries have been accused of precipitously throwing out valuable information in card catalogues, most modern ones have nonetheless made the move to electronic catalogue databases. Large libraries may be scattered within multiple buildings across a town, each having multiple floors, with multiple rooms housing the resources across a series of shelves. Once a user has located a resource within the catalogue, they must then use navigational guidance to retrieve the resource physically; a process that may be assisted through signage, maps, GPS systems, or RFID tagging.

Over half of Finland's population are registered borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pantzar |first=Katja |url=http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160064&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US |title=The humble Number One: Finland |publisher=This is Finland |date=September 2010 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, public library users have borrowed on average roughly 15 books per user per year from 1856 to 1978. From 1978 to 2004, book circulation per user declined approximately 50%. The growth of audiovisuals circulation, estimated at 25% of total circulation in 2004, accounts for about half of this decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galbithink.org/libraries/circulation.htm Statistics on Book Circulation Per User of U.S. Public Libraries Since 1856&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from galbithink.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bibliotheca Alexandrina interior - 2008-07-17.JPG|thumb|Interior of the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]], Alexandria, Egypt, showing both stacks and computer terminals]]

In the 21st century, there has been increasing use of the Internet to gather and retrieve data. The shift to digital libraries has greatly impacted the way people use physical libraries. Between 2002 and 2004, the average American academic library saw the overall number of transactions decline approximately 2.2%.&lt;ref&gt;Applegate, Rachel. "Whose Decline? Which Academic Libraries are "Deserted" in Terms of Reference Transactions?" ''Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly''; 2nd ser. 48 (2008): 176–89. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries are trying to keep up with the digital world and the new generation of students that are used to having information just one click away. For example, the University of California Library System saw a 54% decline in circulation between 1991 and 2001 of 8,377,000 books to 3,832,000.&lt;ref&gt;University of California Library Statistics 1990–91, University-wide Library Planning, University of California Office of the President (July 1991): 12; University of California Library Statistics July 2001, 7, [http://www.slp.ucop.edu/stats/00-01.pdf Ucop.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702182256/http://www.slp.ucop.edu/stats/00-01.pdf |date= 2 July 2010 }}.

These facts might be a consequence of the increased availability of e-resources. In 1999–2000, 105 ARL university libraries spent almost $100&amp;nbsp;million on electronic resources, which is an increase of nearly $23&amp;nbsp;million from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arl.org/newsltr/219/eresources.html "ARL Libraries Spend Nearly $100 Million on Electronic Resources," ''ARL Bimonthly Report 219'', Association of Research Libraries (December 2001)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521154449/http://www.arl.org/newsltr/219/eresources.html |date=21 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 report by the Open E-book Forum found that close to a million e-books had been sold in 2002, generating nearly $8&amp;nbsp;million in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Striphas, Ted. ''The Late Age of Print: Everyday Book Culture From Consumerism to Control''. New York City: [[Columbia University Press]], 2009.

One claim to why there is a decrease in the usage of libraries stems from the observation of the research habits of undergraduate students enrolled in colleges and universities. There have been claims that college undergraduates have become more used to retrieving information from the Internet than a traditional library. As each generation becomes more in tune with the Internet, their desire to retrieve information as quickly and easily as possible has increased. Finding information by simply searching the Internet could be much easier and faster than reading an entire book. In a survey conducted by NetLibrary, 93% of undergraduate students claimed that finding information online makes more sense to them than going to the library. Also, 75% of students surveyed claimed that they did not have enough time to go to the library and that they liked the convenience of the Internet. While the retrieving information from the Internet may be efficient and time saving than visiting a traditional library, research has shown that undergraduates are most likely searching only .03% of the entire web.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, Denise A.

[http://www.diglib.org/use/whitepaper.htm Diglib.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The information that they are finding might be easy to retrieve and more readily available, but may not be as in depth as information from other resources such as the books available at a physical library.

In the mid-2000s, Swedish company Distec invented a library book vending machine known as the [[GoLibrary]], that offers library books to people where there is no branch, limited hours, or high traffic locations such as [[El Cerrito del Norte station|El Cerrito del Norte]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART station]] in [[California]].

(2002). "Reference service statistics and assessment. SPEC kit". Pennsylvania State University.] Accessed: 16 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; puts the necessity for these services in doubt.

Library scholars have acknowledged that libraries need to address the ways that they market their services if they are to compete with the Internet and mitigate the risk of losing users.&lt;ref&gt;Vrana, R., and Barbaric, A. (2007). "Improving visibility of public libraries in the local community: a study of five public libraries in Zagreb, Croatia". ''New Library World''; 108 (9/10), pp. 435–444.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes promoting the information literacy skills training considered vital across the library profession.&lt;ref name="Bell(2005)"/&gt;&lt;ref name= CILIP(2010)/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenney(2004)"&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA485756.html Kenney, B.

This can be problematic for library services that are publicly funded and find it difficult to justify diverting tight funds to apparently peripheral areas such as branding and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Hood, D. &amp; Henderson, K. (2005). "Branding in the United Kingdom Public Library Service". ''New Library World''; 106 (1208/1209), pp. 16–28&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[privacy]] aspect of library usage in the Internet age is a matter of growing concern and advocacy; privacy workshops are run by the [[Library Freedom Project]] which teach librarians about digital tools (such as the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor Project]]) to thwart mass surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/09/17/library_freedom_project_dozen_more_tor_nodes/ |title=SCREW YOU, FEDS!

==Associations==
{{See also|List of library associations}}
The [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) is the leading international association of library organisations. It is the global voice of the library and information profession, and its annual conference provides a venue for librarians to learn from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ifla.org/ |title=International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA)  |website=ifla.org |year=2012 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Library associations in Asia include the [[Indian Library Association]] (ILA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilaindia.net |title=Welcome to Indian Library Association |publisher=Ilaindia.net |accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Association of Special Libraries and Information Centers (IASLIC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iaslic1955.org.in |title=Welcome to Indian Association of Special Libraries and Information Centers|publisher=Iaslic1955.org.in |date=3 September 1955 |accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bengal Library Association (BLA), Kolkata,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacal.org|title=Bengal Library Association|publisher=Blacal.org|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan Library Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pla.org.pk |title=Pakistan Library Association |publisher=Pla.org.pk |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Pakistan Librarians Welfare Organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://librarianswelfare.org |title=Pakistan Librarians Welfare Organization |publisher=Librarianswelfare.org |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bangladesh Association of Librarians, Information Scientists and Documentalists]], the Library Association of Bangladesh, and the [[Sri Lanka Library Association]] (founded 1960).

National associations of the English-speaking world include the [[American Library Association]], the [[Australian Library and Information Association]], the [[Canadian Library Association]], the [[LIANZA|Library and Information Association of New Zealand Aotearoa]], and the [[Research Libraries UK]] (a consortium of 30 university and other research libraries in the United Kingdom). Library bodies such as [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|CILIP]] (formerly the Library Association, founded 1877) may advocate the role that libraries and librarians can play in a modern Internet environment, and in the teaching of [[information literacy]] skills.&lt;ref name="CILIP(2010)"&gt;CILIP.

[[Public library advocacy]] is support given to a [[public library]] for its financial and philosophical goals or needs. Most often this takes the form of monetary or material donations or campaigning to the institutions which oversee the library, sometimes by advocacy groups such as [[Friends of Libraries]] and community members. Originally, library advocacy was centered on the library itself, but current trends show libraries positioning themselves to demonstrate they provide "economic value to the community" in means that are not directly related to the checking out of books and other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Ellen G.  |date=2009|title=Hard Times = A New Brand of Advocacy|journal=Georgia Library Quarterly|volume= 46|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1269&amp;context=glq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macau was formerly [[Portuguese Macau|a colony of the Portuguese Empire]], after [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] leased the territory as a trading post in 1557.

[[File:Saopaulo Chinnery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ruins of St. Paul's]], built in 1602 and destroyed by fire in 1835]]

The history of Macau is traced back to the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BC), when the region now called Macau came under the jurisdiction of Panyu County, Nanhai Prefecture (modern [[Guangdong]]).&lt;ref name="M517" /&gt; The first recorded Chinese inhabitants of the area were people seeking refuge in Macau from invading [[Mongols]] during the [[Southern Song]].&lt;ref name="Macau history in Macau encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macaudata.com/macauweb/Encyclopedia/html/44907.htm |title=The entry "Macau history" in Macau Encyclopedia |accessdate=2 January 2008 |publisher=Macau Foundation |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013210914/http://macaudata.com/macauweb/Encyclopedia/html/44907.htm |archivedate=13 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), fishermen migrated to Macau from Guangdong and [[Fujian]]. The Macau native people were [[Tanka people|Tanka]] boat people.

Macau did not develop as a major settlement until the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1513, [[Jorge Álvares]] became the first Portuguese to land in China. In 1535, Portuguese traders obtained the rights to anchor ships in Macau's harbours and to carry out trading activities, though not the right to stay onshore.&lt;ref&gt;Fung, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1552–1553, they obtained temporary permission to erect storage sheds onshore, in order to dry out goods drenched by sea water;&lt;ref name="F7"&gt;Fung, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; they soon built rudimentary stone houses around the area now called Nam Van.

In 1557, the Portuguese [[Luso-Chinese agreement (1554)|established a permanent settlement in Macau]], paying an annual rent of 500 [[tael]]s (18.9 [[kilogram]]s{{\}}41.6 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]) of silver.&lt;ref name="F7" /&gt; The Portuguese continued to pay an annual tribute up to 1863 in order to stay in Macau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Macau prospered as a port, but it was the target of repeated failed attempts&lt;ref&gt;History of the Qing ({{lang|zh|清史稿}})&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2018}} by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] to gain possession of it across multiple Dutch raids occurring in the early 1600s. The raids on Macau culminated in the [[Battle of Macau]] on 24 June 1622, in which the Portuguese handily repelled the attack. While Dutch raids on Portuguese colonies continued in the coming years, this definitive defeat discouraged any future Dutch attempts to conquer the settlement. The majority of the defenders were African slaves, with only a few Portuguese soldiers and priests.

Following the [[First Opium War]] (1839–42), Portugal occupied the empty islands of [[Taipa]] and [[Coloane]] in 1851 and 1864 respectively. On 1 December 1887, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] and Portuguese governments signed the [[Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking]], under which China ceded the right of "perpetual occupation and government of Macao by Portugal" in compliance with the statements of the Protocol of Lisbon. In return, Macau Government would cooperate with Hong Kong's smuggling trade in Indian opium and China would profit from imposing customs taxes. Portugal was also obliged "never to alienate Macau without previous agreement with China", therefore ensuring that negotiation between Portugal and France (regarding a possible exchange of Macau and [[Portuguese Guinea]] with the [[French Congo]]) or with other countries would not go forward&amp;nbsp;– so that the British commercial interests would be secured; Macau officially became a territory under Portuguese administration.&lt;ref name="Macau history in Macau encyclopedia"/&gt;

In 1928, after the Qing dynasty had been overthrown following the [[Xinhai Revolution]], the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government officially notified Portugal that it would abrogate the Treaty of Amity and Commerce;&lt;ref name="M518"&gt;Macau Yearbook 2007, 518.&lt;/ref&gt; the two powers signed a new Sino-Portuguese Friendship and Trade Treaty in place of the abrogated treaty. Changing only a few provisions concerning tariff principles and matters relating to business affairs, the new treaty did not alter the sovereignty of Macau and Portuguese government of Macau remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Fung, 409–410.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], unlike [[Portuguese Timor]], which was occupied by the Japanese in 1942 along with [[West Timor|Dutch Timor]], the Japanese respected Portuguese neutrality in Macau, but only up to a point. Macau enjoyed a brief period of economic prosperity as the only neutral port in [[South China]] after the Japanese had occupied Guangzhou and Hong Kong. In August 1943, Japanese troops seized the British steamer ''Sian'' in Macau and killed about 20 guards. The next month they demanded the installation of Japanese "advisors" under the threat of overt military occupation. The result was that a virtual Japanese [[protectorate]] was created over Macau.&lt;ref name="Garrett, p. 116"/&gt;

When it was discovered that "neutral" Macau was planning to sell aviation fuel to Japan, aircraft from the {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} bombed and strafed the hangar of the Naval Aviation Centre on 16 January 1945 to destroy the fuel. American air raids on targets in Macau were also made on 25 February and 11 June 1945.  Following Portuguese government protests, in 1950 the United States paid US$20,255,952 to the government of Portugal.&lt;ref name="Garrett, p. 116"&gt;p. 116 Garrett, Richard J.

Between the end of the [[Pacific War]] and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Macau served as a safe haven for refugees of the [[Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;p.117 Garrett, Richard J.

After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Beijing government declared the Sino-Portuguese Treaty invalid as an "[[unequal treaty]]" imposed by foreigners on China. However, Beijing was not ready to settle the treaty question, allowing the maintenance of "the status quo" until a more appropriate time.&lt;ref&gt;Fung, 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by the [[Cultural Revolution]] in mainland China and by general dissatisfaction with Portuguese government, riots broke out in Macau in 1966. In the most serious, the so-called [[12-3 incident]], 6 people were killed and more than 200 people were injured.&lt;ref name="Lo Shiu-hing"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lo Shiu-hing |title=Aspects of Political Development in Macau |journal=The China Quarterly |volume=120 |date=December 1989 |pages=837–851 |doi=10.1017/S030574100001849X}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January 1967, the Portuguese government issued a formal apology by means of an "admission of guilt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Sovereignty at the Edge: Macau &amp; the Question of Chineseness]]|volume=|year=2010|author=Cathryn H.

Shortly after Portugal's 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]], which overthrew the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo dictatorship]], the new government determined it would relinquish all its overseas possessions. In 1976, Lisbon redefined Macau as a "Chinese territory under Portuguese administration" and granted it a large measure of administrative, financial, and economic autonomy. Three years later, Portugal and China agreed to regard Macau as "a Chinese territory under [temporary] Portuguese administration".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e61PAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22a+Chinese+territory+under+%5Btemporary%5D+Portuguese+administration%22&amp;dq=%22a+Chinese+territory+under+%5Btemporary%5D+Portuguese+administration%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj74pP2iMXQAhUGKMAKHYGHBUgQ6AEIRDAH ''Asian Bulletin''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126130316/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e61PAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22a+Chinese+territory+under+%5Btemporary%5D+Portuguese+administration%22&amp;dq=%22a+Chinese+territory+under+%5Btemporary%5D+Portuguese+administration%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj74pP2iMXQAhUGKMAKHYGHBUgQ6AEIRDAH |date=26 November 2016 }}, Volume 10, Issues 7–12, APACL Publications, 1985, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese and Portuguese governments commenced negotiations on the question of Macau in June 1986.

=== Executive ===

The government in Macau is headed by the [[Chief Executive of Macau]], who is appointed by the central government upon the recommendation of an election committee, whose three hundred members are nominated by corporate and community bodies. The recommendation is made by an election within the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/i/2004/14/lei03_en.asp#c4a32 |title=Election of the Chief Executive |accessdate=5 September 2006 |publisher=Government Printing Bureau |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051108035112/http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/i/2004/14/lei03_en.asp#c4a32 |archivedate=8 November 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief executive's cabinet is made up of five policy secretaries and two commissariats and is advised by the [[Executive Council of Macau]], which has between seven and eleven members.&lt;ref name="Macau 2007 Yearbook"&gt;{{cite book |year=2007 |title=Macau 2007 Yearbook |publisher=Government Information Bureau of Macau SAR |isbn=978-99937-56-09-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Ho]], a community leader and former banker, was the first chief executive of the Macau SAR, replacing [[Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira|General Vasco Rocha Vieira]] at midnight on 20 December 1999.

=== Legislature ===
[[File:Assembleia Legislativa.jpg|thumb|[[Legislative Assembly of Macau]]]]

The legislative organ of the territory is the [[Legislative Assembly of Macau|Legislative Assembly]], a 33-member body comprising 14 directly elected members, 12 indirectly elected members representing [[Functional constituency (Macau)|functional constituencies]] and seven members appointed by the chief executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al.gov.mo/en/en.htm#Composition |accessdate=5 September 2006 |title=Introduction of the Legislative Assembly of the Macau Special Administrative Region |publisher=The Legislative Assembly of Macau |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194636/http://www.al.gov.mo/en/en.htm |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any permanent residents at or over 18 years of age are eligible to vote in direct elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html |accessdate=7 January 2008 |title=List of Suffrage |publisher=CIA&amp;nbsp;– The World Factbook |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109020202/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html |archivedate=9 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect election is limited to organizations registered as "corporate voters" and a 300-member election committee drawn from broad regional groupings, municipal organizations, and central government bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200403/31/eng20040331_139074.shtml |accessdate=7 January 2008 |title=Polls favor indirect vote of Macau's next chief executive |publisher=(Source: Xinhua) People's Daily Online |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522184955/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200403/31/eng20040331_139074.shtml |archivedate=22 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judiciary ===
{{main|Legal system of Macau}}
[[File:EdfDosTribunaisDeSegundaEUltimaInstancias1.jpg|thumb|Seat of the Superior Tribunal of Macau]]

The original framework of the legal system, based largely on the [[Law of Portugal]], the Portuguese civil law system, was preserved after 1999. The territory has its own independent judicial system with a [[High Court]] independent of both the local Government and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Judges are selected by a committee and appointed by the chief executive. Foreign judges may serve on the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org.mo/eng/law/4judicialSystem.html |title=Brief Introduction of Judicial System of Macau SAR |accessdate=5 September 2006 |author=Sam Hou Fai |publisher=UNESCO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430035340/http://www.unesco.org.mo/eng/law/4judicialSystem.html |archivedate=30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judicial organs of the Macau are the [[Politics of Macau|Public Ministry]]; the Courts of First Instance, which are subdivided into the Basic Judicial Court and Administrative Court; the Court of the Second Instance and the [[Court of Final Appeal (Macau)|Court of Final Appeal]].&lt;ref name="Legal System of Macau"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/7066.htm |title=Background Note: Macau&amp;nbsp;– Government |publisher=Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, U.S. Department of State |accessdate=24 May 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508225846/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/7066.htm |archivedate=8 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal system of Macau is essentially based on the model of [[Law of Portugal|Portuguese law]], and is thus part of the family of continental legal systems ([[Civil law (legal system)|Roman-Germanic]]). From 1987 to 1999, this legal system was completely modernized with a view to the transfer of sovereignty from Macau to the [[People's Republic of China]]. Thus, a number of new laws and codes have been adopted, including the Criminal Code (1995), the Civil Code (1999), the Commercial Code (1999), the Criminal Procedure Code (1996) and the Civil Procedure Code (1999). Following the transition, major reforms in the legal system continued, such as the use of [[Chinese language]] in courts and legislations.

From a constitutional point of view, the Macau legal system is characterized by the existence of a text with constitutional force in the Macau SAR, the [[Macau Basic Law|Basic Law of the Macau Special Administrative Region]], promulgated by the [[National People's Congress]] in 1993. As a rule, the national laws of the People's Republic of China do not apply to Macau, except for those expressly indicated in Annex III of the Basic Law. At present, they are eleven and deal with matters not included in the autonomy of the Special Administrative Region, such as national defense and external relations.

The gambling sector, being a fundamental economic activity for Macau, is subject to a very developed regulation, thus having a good and developed right of the game. There is no [[death penalty]] or [[life imprisonment]] in Macau, as they are not covered by the Macau Criminal Code.

=== Military ===
{{main|People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison}}
{{see also|Military of Macau under Portuguese rule|Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macau Special Administrative Region}}

Under Portuguese rule, Macau often served as an expeditionary base to [[Japan]] and other regions of East Asia from the 16th century onwards, while maintaining a strong garrison mainly to repel Dutch and mainland Chinese attacks. However, since the [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|allied]] [[United Kingdom|British]] settled Hong Kong, the need for a strong military presence in Macau dimmed and it became limited before ceasing in 1974. However, despite having no Portuguese garrison left on the territory, a small security force managed by the local [[Polícia de Segurança Pública|PSP]] was kept, which proved useful with the escalating [[Triad (underground society)|triad]] warfare tensions towards the last decades of Portuguese administration. Also the [[Captain of the Port|Capitania dos Portos]] kept operating a coast guard and the [[Portuguese Armed Forces|Portuguese airforce]] kept airfields active until the opening of [[Macau International Airport]] in the mid-1990s. In 1999, upon handover to the PRC, a substantial [[People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison|garrison of the People's Liberation Army]] was established in the city helping deliver the last blow to the violence perpetrated by the triads, who were weakened by police action and arrests prior to the [[Handover of Macau to China|handover]]. The garrison remains, with a large portion of the forces stationed in neighbouring [[Zhuhai]] as well.

According to the Article 14, [[Macau Basic Law]], The Central People's Government shall be responsible for the defense of the Macau Special Administrative Region. And The Government of the Macau SAR shall be responsible for the maintenance of public order in the Region.

===International relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Macau}}

As a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] (SAR) of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), Macau's diplomatic relations and [[defense (military)|defence]] are the responsibility of the [[Central People's Government]] of the PRC. Except diplomatic relations and defence, nonetheless, Macau has retained considerable autonomy in all aspects, including economic and commercial relations, customs control.

According to Chapter VII of [[basic law of Macau|Macau's basic law]], Macau may, on its own, using the name ''Macau, China'' or ''Macao, China'', maintain and develop relations and conclude and implement agreements with foreign states and regions and relevant [[international organisation]]s in the appropriate fields, including the economic, trade, financial and monetary, shipping, communications, tourism, cultural, science and technology, and sports fields. In addition,  Macau can participate in international organizations and conferences not limited to states.

The Macau government has maintained offices in [[Lisbon]], [[Taipei]], [[Beijing]] and in [[Brussels]] for the [[European Union]] and [[Geneva]] for the [[World Trade Organization]]. The Special Administrative Region of Macau is member of the World Trade Organization, [[International Monetary Fund]] as well as other international cultural and commercial organizations.

===Administrative divisions===

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Macau}}

Macau is situated {{convert|60|km|mi|0}} southwest of Hong Kong and {{convert|145|km|mi|0}} from [[Guangzhou]] of [[Mainland China]]. It also has {{convert|41|km|mi|0}} of coastline, yet only {{convert|310|m|ft|sigfig=2}} of land border with [[Guangdong]] of [[Mainland China]].&lt;ref name="M475"&gt;Macau Yearbook 2007, 475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Asiarooms&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/macau/macau-overview/macau-geography.html |title=Macau Geography |accessdate=6 January 2008 |publisher=AsiaRooms.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112081315/http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/macau/macau-overview/macau-geography.html |archivedate=12 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the [[Macau Peninsula]] itself and the islands of [[Taipa]] and [[Coloane]], which are now connected by landfill forming [[Cotai]].

Macau Peninsula was originally an island, but a connecting [[sandbar]] gradually turned into a narrow [[isthmus]]. Land reclamation in the 17th century transformed Macau into a peninsula with generally flat terrain, though numerous steep hills still mark the original land mass.&lt;ref name=Asiarooms/&gt; Alto de Coloane is the highest point in Macau, with an altitude of {{convert|170.6|m|ft|1}}.&lt;ref name="M475"/&gt; With a dense [[urbanisation|urban environment]], Macau has no arable land, pastures, forest, or woodland.

In 2015, the Chinese government assigned Macau administrative responsibility for {{convert|85|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of coastal ocean area.&lt;ref name=waterarea&gt;{{cite web|title=Macao to administrate 85 square kilometres of waters|url=http://www.gcs.gov.mo/showNews.php?DataUcn=95418&amp;PageLang=E|website=Government Information Bureau of the MSARGovernment Information Bureau of the MSAR|publisher=Government of Macau|accessdate=21 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222115647/http://www.gcs.gov.mo/showNews.php?DataUcn=95418&amp;PageLang=E|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
Macau has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cwa''), despite its low elevation coastal location south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], with average relative humidity between 75% and 90%.&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/153/climate/Far-East-Asia/Macau.html |title=Macau Climate, Temp, Rainfall and Humidity |accessdate=6 January 2008 |publisher=Nexus Business Media Limited |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216232707/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/153/climate/Far-East-Asia/Macau.html |archivedate=16 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to much of South China, seasonal climate is greatly influenced by the [[monsoon]]s, and differences in temperature and humidity between summer and winter are noticeable, though not as great as in mainland China. The average annual temperature of Macau is {{convert|22.7|°C|°F|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smg.gov.mo/www/smg/centenary2/index_four.htm |title=100 years of Macau Climate |accessdate=15 February 2011 |publisher=Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110060346/http://www.smg.gov.mo/www/smg/centenary2/index_four.htm |archivedate=10 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; July is the warmest month, the average temperature being {{convert|28.9|°C|°F|1}}. The coolest month is January, with a mean temperature of {{convert|14.5|°C|°F|1}}.&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;

Located on China's southern coast, Macau has ample rainfall, with average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] being {{convert|2120|mm|in|0}}. However, winter is mostly dry due to the influence of the vast [[Siberian High]] affecting much of East Asia. Autumn in Macau, from October to November, is sunny and still pleasantly warm with lower humidity. Winter (December to early March) is generally mild with temperatures above {{convert|13|°C|0}} most of the time, although they can drop below {{convert|8|°C|0}} at times. Humidity starts to increase from late March. Summer is very warm to hot (often rising above {{convert|30|°C|0}} during the day). The hot weather is often followed by heavy rain, thunderstorms and occasional typhoons.&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;

Notice that the climate is similar to Hong Kong's due to proximity.

Macau's economy is based largely on tourism. Other chief economic activities in Macau are export-geared textile and garment manufacturing, banking and other financial services.&lt;ref name="C12"&gt;Chan, 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The clothing industry provides about three quarters of export earnings, and the gambling, tourism and hospitality industry is estimated to contribute more than 50% of Macau's GDP, and 70% of Macau government revenue.&lt;ref name="Macau 2007 Yearbook"/&gt;

Macau is a founding member of the [[WTO]] and has maintained sound economic and trade relations with more than 120 countries and regions, with [[European Union]] and [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries|Portuguese-speaking countries]] in particular; Macau is also a member of the [[IMF]].&lt;ref name="CIA factbook"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mc.html |title = CIA the world factbook |accessdate = 15 November 2007 |publisher = CIA the World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Macau |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071114013759/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mc.html |archivedate = 14 November 2007 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]] classifies Macau as a high income economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://web.worldbank.org/servlets/ECR?contentMDK=20421402&amp;sitePK=239419#High_income |title = Income Group&amp;nbsp;– High Income, World Bank |accessdate=15 November 2007 |publisher = World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the GDP per capita of the region in 2006 was US$28,436. After the 1999 [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Macau|Handover]], China eased travel restrictions and visits from the mainland rose rapidly. Together with the liberalization of Macau's gambling industry in 2001, which induced significant investment inflows, the average [[Economic growth|growth rate]] of the economy between 2001 and 2006 was approximately 13.1% annually.&lt;ref name="AMCMstat"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.amcm.gov.mo/economic_statistics/economic.htm |title = Economic statistics from Monetary Authority of Macau |publisher = AMCM |accessdate = 23 December 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20121219210637/http://www.amcm.gov.mo/economic_statistics/economic.htm |archivedate = 19 December 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the gambling revenue in Macao fell by 48.6 percent from a year earlier to 19.5 billion [[patacas]] ($2.4 billion), the biggest monthly decline that has ever been recorded. Reasons for this fall of revenue are related to the slowdown that the Chinese economy is having and a corruption crackdown by Chinese officials which has constrained lavish spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Macau Casino Revenue Plunges by Half in February|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/03/03/world/asia/ap-as-macau-casino-revenues.html?_r=0|accessdate=5 April 2015|agency=The New York Times|publisher=THE ASSOCIATED PRESS|date=3 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419182249/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/03/03/world/asia/ap-as-macau-casino-revenues.html?_r=0|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Macau, the unit of currency is the [[Macanese pataca|pataca]], which is currently pegged to the [[Hong Kong dollar]] at a rate of HK$1&amp;nbsp;= MOP1.03.&lt;ref name="OANDA14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/MOP|title=Macau Pataca|accessdate=3 June 2014|publisher=OANDA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607002649/http://www.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/MOP|archivedate=7 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name pataca is a Portuguese word which was applied to the [[Mexican dollar]]s that were the main circulating coin in the wider region in the second half of the 19th century. In 1894, the pataca was introduced in both Macau and [[Portuguese Timor]] as a unit of account for the [[Mexican dollar]] and the other silver dollar coins in circulation. However, the pataca was not the official currency when it was first enacted.&lt;ref name="OANDA14"/&gt; In 1901, it was decided to grant the [[Banco Nacional Ultramarino]] the exclusive rights to issue banknotes denominated in patacas, and in the year 1906, all foreign coins were outlawed.&lt;ref name="OANDA14"/&gt; However, the Chinese were suspicious of these paper patacas, being so accustomed to using silver for barter, and as such, the paper patacas circulated at a discount in relation to the silver dollar coins. {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}In 1935, when [[China]] and [[Hong Kong]] abandoned the silver standard, the [[Hong Kong dollar]] was pegged to sterling at the fixed rate of 1 shilling and 3 pence, whereas the pataca was pegged to the Portuguese escudo at a sterling equivalent rate of only 1 shilling. From 1945 to 1951, fractional coins of the pataca were minted for issue in Portuguese Timor; and, in 1952, similar issues were minted for Macau including an actual pataca coin for the first time. {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

By 2015 the Macau government was publishing English language documents, and beginning in 2000 the [[Macau Government Information Bureau]] (GCS) has been releasing several portions of its policy address in the English language. Andrew Moody, an associate professor of the [[University of Macau]], argued in his 2008 essay "Macau English: Status, functions and forms" that, in the words of Catarina Pinto of the ''[[Macau Daily Times]]'', the English language is "in practice, ‘a [[de facto]]’ official language of the territory."&lt;ref name=Pinto&gt;{{cite web|author=Pinto, Catarina|url=https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/use-of-english-in-macau-a-de-facto-official-language.html|title=USE OF ENGLISH IN MACAU: A ‘de facto’ official language|publisher=''[[Macau Daily Times]]''|date=2015-07-06|accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of the population using English as their primary language increased from 1.5 in 2006 to 2.3 in 2011.&lt;ref name=Pinto/&gt;

===Employment===
Since Macau has an economy driven by tourism, 14.6% of the workforce is employed in restaurants and hotels, and 10.3% in the gambling industry.&lt;ref name=MO/&gt; With the opening of several casino resorts and other major constructions underway, many sectors reportedly experience a shortage of labour, and the government seeks to import labour from neighbouring regions.

The number of imported workers stood at a record high of 98,505 in the second quarter of 2008, representing more than 25% of the labour force in Macau.&lt;ref name="pstat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsec.gov.mo/index.asp?src=/english/indicator/e_piem_indicator.html |title=Principal statistical indicators |accessdate=27 December 2007 |publisher=Statistics and Census Service (DSEC) of the Macau Government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102030741/http://www.dsec.gov.mo/index.asp?src=%2Fenglish%2Findicator%2Fe_piem_indicator.html |archivedate=2 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some local workers complain about the lack of jobs due to the influx of cheap imported labour. Some also claim that the problem of illegal labour is severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6611245.stm |title=Rare Macau protest turns violent |accessdate=27 December 2007 |publisher=BBC News&amp;nbsp;– Business |date=1 May 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110025657/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6611245.stm |archivedate=10 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is the widening of income inequality in the region. Macau's [[Gini coefficient]], a popular measure of income inequality where a low value indicates a more equal income distribution, rose from 0.43 in 1998 to 0.48 in 2006. It is higher than those of neighbouring regions, such as [[mainland China]] (0.447), [[South Korea]] (0.316) and [[Singapore]] (0.425).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_7160000/newsid_7165400/7165442.stm |title=Profile of China: The problems behind Macau's prosperity |accessdate=15 January 2008 |publisher=BBC Chinese |language=Chinese |date=31 December 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106204013/http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_7160000/newsid_7165400/7165442.stm |archivedate=6 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Macau}}

Macau residents are endowed with considerable religious tolerance and freedom. Most Chinese in Macau are profoundly influenced by their own tradition and culture. While most are not religiously affiliated, many take part in [[Chinese folk religion]] ([[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]).&lt;ref name="Macau 2007 Yearbook" /&gt; According to a survey conducted in 2005, 2007 and 2009, 55% of the population do not declare religious affiliation, 30% follows folk faiths, 10% are adherents of Buddhism or Taoism, and the remaining 5% are Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Zhidong Hao, 2011. pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stats2009"&gt;Zheng, VWT; Wan, PS.

"Drawing on empirical data obtained from three consecutive territory-wide household surveys conducted in 2005, 2007, and 2009 respectively, this paper attempts to shed light on the current religious profile of Macau residents."&lt;/ref&gt; Most Christians in Macau are members of the [[Catholic Church]], which is organized and structured in Macau in the [[Diocese of Macau]].

=== Education ===
{{Main|Education in Macau}}
[[File:UM Hengqin 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[University of Macau]]]]

A fifteen-year free education is currently being offered to residents, that includes a three-year kindergarten, followed by a six-year primary education and a six-year secondary education. The [[literacy rate]] of the territory is 93.5%. The illiterates are mainly among the senior residents aged 65 or above; the younger generation, for example the population aged 15–29, has a literacy rate of above 99%.&lt;ref name="2006 by-census" /&gt; Currently, there is only one school in Macau where Portuguese is the medium of instruction, [[Macau Portuguese School]].

Macau does not have its own region-wide education system; non-tertiary schools follow either the British, the Chinese, Portuguese, or the Canadian education system. There are currently 10 tertiary educational institutions in the region, four of them being public.&lt;ref name="Macau 2007 Yearbook"/&gt; In 2006, the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], a worldwide test of 15-year-old schoolchildren's scholastic performance coordinated by [[OECD]], ranked Macau as the fifth and sixth in science and problem solving respectively.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pisa.oecd.org/document/2/0,3343,en_32252351_32236191_39718850_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=PISA 2006 Science Competencies for Tomorrow's World |accessdate=10 January 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206160114/http://www.pisa.oecd.org/document/2/0,3343,en_32252351_32236191_39718850_1_1_1_1,00.html |archivedate=6 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, educational attainment in Macau is relatively low when compared to other high income countries. According to the 2006 by-census, among the resident population aged 14 and above, only 51.8% has a secondary education and 12.6% has a tertiary education.&lt;ref name="2006 by-census"/&gt;

As prescribed by the [[Macau Basic Law]] Chapter VI Article 121, the [[Government of Macau]] shall, on its own, formulate policies on education, including policies regarding the educational system and its administration, the language of instruction, the allocation of funds, the [[Test (assessment)|examination]] system, the recognition of educational qualifications, and the system of academic awards so as to promote educational development. The government shall also in accordance with law, gradually institute a [[compulsory education]] system. Community organizations and individuals may, in accordance with law, run educational undertakings of various kinds.&lt;ref name=BLM/&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
{{see also|List of hospitals in Macau}}
[[File:Kiang Wu Hospital.jpg|thumb|[[Kiang Wu Hospital]]]]
Macau is served by one major public hospital, the [[Hospital Conde S. Januário]], and one major private hospital, the [[Kiang Wu Hospital]], both located in Macau Peninsula, as well as a university associated hospital called [[Macau University of Science and Technology Hospital]] in [[Cotai]]. In addition to hospitals, Macau also has numerous health centres providing free basic medical care to residents. Consultation in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcs.gov.mo/files/spage/CFA10_E.html |title=Macau Factsheet |accessdate=13 November 2007 |publisher=The Govt. of Macau SAR |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114173436/http://www.gcs.gov.mo/files/spage/CFA10_E.html |archivedate=14 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the Macau hospitals are independently assessed through [[international healthcare accreditation]]. There are no western-style medical schools in Macau, and thus all aspiring physicians in Macau have to obtain their education and qualification elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Macau 2007 Yearbook" /&gt; Local nurses are trained at the Macau Polytechnic Institute and the Kiang Wu [[Nursing]] College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipm.edu.mo/ess/ |title=Macau Polytechnic Institute General Information |accessdate=3 December 2007 |publisher=Macau Polytechnic Institute |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218064708/http://www.ipm.edu.mo/ess/ |archivedate=18 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kwnc.edu.mo/web/cmain.htm |title=Homepage of the College of Nursing and Midwifery |accessdate=13 November 2007 |publisher=College of Nursing and Midwifery, Macau}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are no training courses in [[midwifery]] in Macau.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} A study by the [[University of Macau]], commissioned by the Macau SAR government, concluded that Macau is too small to have its own medical specialist training centre.&lt;ref name=Yaupatients&gt;{{cite web|author=Yau, Elaine|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-beauty/article/2017927/why-macau-spends-millions-send-its-patients-hong-kong-some|title=Why Macau spends millions to send its patients to Hong Kong – some by air|publisher=''[[South China Morning Post]]''|date=2016-09-12|accessdate=2017-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409114716/http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-beauty/article/2017927/why-macau-spends-millions-send-its-patients-hong-kong-some|archivedate=9 April 2017|df=dmy-all}} - Print title: "Patients running out"&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Macau Corps of Firefighters'' (Portuguese: ''Corpo de Bombeiros de Macau'') is responsible for ambulance service (Ambulância de Macau). The [[Macau Red Cross]] also operates ambulances ([[Toyota HiAce]] vans) for emergency and non-emergencies to local hospitals with volunteer staff. The organization has a total of 739 uniformed firefighters and paramedics serving from 7 stations in Macau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.mo/en/care_ambulance.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235440/http://www.redcross.org.mo/en/care_ambulance.htm |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Health Bureau in Macau is mainly responsible for coordinating the activities between the public and private organizations in the area of [[public health]], and assure the health of citizens through specialized and [[primary health care]] services, as well as disease prevention and [[health promotion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssm.gov.mo/design/introduction/e_introduce_fs.htm |title=The introduction of Health Bureau, Macau SAR |accessdate=13 November 2007 |publisher=The Govt. of Macau SAR |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912141127/http://www.ssm.gov.mo/design/introduction/e_introduce_fs.htm |archivedate=12 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Macau Centre for Disease Control and Prevention]] was established in 2001, which monitors the operation of hospitals, health centres, and the [[blood transfusion]] centre in Macau. It also handles the organization of care and prevention of diseases affecting the population, sets guidelines for hospitals and private healthcare providers, and issues [[medical license|licences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssm.gov.mo/design/organization/e_legis_fs.htm |title=The policy and functions of the department of health, Macau SAR |accessdate=13 November 2007 |publisher=The Govt. of Macau SAR |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912140926/http://www.ssm.gov.mo/design/organization/e_legis_fs.htm |archivedate=12 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2016}} Macau healthcare authorities send patients to [[Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong|Queen Mary Hospital]] in Hong Kong in instances where the local Macau hospitals are not equipped to deal with their scenarios, and many Macau residents intentionally seek healthcare in Hong Kong because they place more trust in Hong Kong doctors than in Mainland-trained doctors operating in Macau.&lt;ref name=Yaupatients/&gt;

In Macau, traffic [[left hand drive|drives on the left]], unlike in either mainland China or Portugal, but like neighbouring Hong Kong. Macau has a well-established public transport network connecting the [[Macau Peninsula]], [[Cotai]], [[Taipa Island]] and [[Coloane Island]]. Buses and taxis are the major modes of public transport in Macau. Currently two companies{{spaced ndash}}[[Transmac]] and [[Transportas Companhia de Macau]] operate franchised public bus services in Macau.&lt;ref&gt;Macau Yearbook 2007, 453–454.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[trishaw]], a hybrid of the tricycle and the rickshaw, is also available, though it is mainly for sightseeing purposes. Macau has two public bus operators: Transmac and Transportes Coletivos de Macau, which operate routes covering most of the city, making it the best public transport for traveling inside Macau and its islands. Free Casino Shuttle Buses are everywhere in Macau. Due to tourism being the main economic industry in Macau a majority of the larger hotels provide free round trip shuttle bus services which cover the major tourist sites including the airport, Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal and other sites. Some larger hotels such as Venetian Hotel and Holiday Inn even provide a free shuttle between them. The frequency for each route is usually 15 minutes.

The taxi system is noted for having a notoriously poor reputation among tourists and even locals. Common complaints include "constant overcharging, refusal of passengers when the destination or passenger type does not suit the driver, circuitous routes and even violent behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://macaudailytimes.com.mo/bizcuits-bad-taxis-bad-macau-tourism.html|title=Bizcuits {{!}} Bad taxis, bad Macau tourism {{!}} MACAU DAILY TIMES 澳門每日時報|website=macaudailytimes.com.mo|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170529042152/http://macaudailytimes.com.mo/bizcuits-bad-taxis-bad-macau-tourism.html|archivedate=29 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the Macau government have been making attempts to hold drivers to a higher standard of service through methods such as undercover police prosecuting drivers who violate the taxi regulations on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wgm8.com/macaus-taxi-shame/|title=Macau's Taxi Shame - World Gaming Magazine|date=2014-08-31|work=World Gaming Magazine|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917045858/http://www.wgm8.com/macaus-taxi-shame/|archivedate=17 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Macau|The Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal]] and the [[Taipa Ferry Terminal]] provides cross-border transportation services for passengers travelling between Macau and Hong Kong, while the Yuet Tung Terminal in the Inner Harbour serves those travelling between Macau and cities in mainland China, including [[Shekou Industrial Zone|Shekou]] and [[Shenzhen]].&lt;ref&gt;Macau Yearbook 2007,458.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Macau Light Rail Transit]] or '''Macau LRT''' also known as '''Metro Ligeiro de Macau''' is a [[mass transit system]] in Macau under construction. It will serve the [[Macau Peninsula]], [[Taipa]] and [[Cotai]], serving major border checkpoints such as the [[Portas do Cerco|Border Gate]], the [[Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Macau|Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal]], the [[Lotus Bridge]] Border and the [[Macau International Airport]]. It is planned to open in 2019.

Macau has one active international airport, known as [[Macau International Airport]] located at the eastern end of Taipa and neighbouring waters. The airport used to serve as one of the main transit hubs for passengers travelling between mainland China and [[Taiwan]], but now with the introduction of direct flights between those two regions, passenger traffic in this regard has lessened.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fung, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the primary hub for [[Air Macau]]. In 2006, the airport handled about 5 million passengers.&lt;ref&gt;Macau Yearbook 2007, 467–468.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mixing of the [[Culture of China|Chinese]] and [[Culture of Portugal|Portuguese cultures]] and religious traditions for more than four centuries has left Macau with an inimitable collection of holidays, festivals and events. The biggest event of the year is the [[Macau Grand Prix]] in November,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macau.grandprix.gov.mo/app/home/mgpc/en |title=Grand Prix Macau |accessdate=4 January 2008 |publisher=Macau Grand Prix Committee |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226175701/http://www.macau.grandprix.gov.mo/app/home/mgpc/en |archivedate=26 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the main streets in Macau Peninsula are converted to a racetrack bearing similarities with the [[Monaco Grand Prix]]. Other annual events include Macau Arts festival in March, the International Fireworks Display Contest in September, the International Music festival in October and/or November, and the Macau International Marathon in December.

The Lunar [[Chinese New Year]] is the most important traditional festival and celebration normally takes place in late January or early February.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/macau/macau-festivals-&amp;-events/index.html |title=Macau Festivals &amp; Events |accessdate=4 January 2008 |publisher=AsiaRooms.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229122529/http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/macau/macau-festivals-%26-events/index.html |archivedate=29 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pou Tai Un Temple in Taipa is the place for the Feast of Tou Tei, the Earth god, in February. The Procession of the Passion of Our Lord is a well-known Roman Catholic rite and journey, which travels from Saint Austin's Church to the Cathedral, also taking place in February.&lt;ref name=Asiarooms/&gt;

A-Ma Temple, which honours the Goddess [[Mazu (goddess)|Matsu]], is in full swing in April with many worshippers celebrating the A-Ma festival. In May it is common to see dancing dragons at the Feast of the Drunken Dragon and twinkling-clean Buddhas at the Feast of the Bathing of Lord Buddha. In [[Coloane Village]], the [[Taoist]] god [[Tam Kong]] is also honoured on the same day.&lt;ref name=Asiarooms/&gt; [[Dragon Boat Festival|Dragon Boat festival]] is brought into play on Nam Van Lake in June and Hungry Ghosts' festival, in late August and/or early September every year. All events and festivities of the year end with [[Dongzhi Festival|Winter Solstice]] in December.

Macau preserves many historical properties in the urban area. The [[Historic Centre of Macau]], which includes some twenty-five historic locations, was officially listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] on 15 July 2005 during the 29th session of the [[World Heritage Committee]], held in [[Durban]], South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/135 |title=Mostar, Macau and Biblical vestiges in Israel are among the 17 cultural sites inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List |accessdate=5 September 2006 |publisher=UNESCO |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813122915/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/135 |archivedate=13 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the Macao government is criticized for ignoring the conservation of heritage in urban planning.&lt;ref name="YC2007"&gt;{{Cite book|title=China's Macao Transformed: Challenge and Development in the 21st Century|last=YU|first=Eilo W.Y.|last2=CHAN|first2=Ming K.|publisher=City University of HK Press.|year=2014|isbn=978-9629372071|location=|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, local residents of Macao wrote a letter to [[UNESCO]] complaining about construction projects around [[world heritage]] [[Guia Lighthouse]] (Focal height 108 meters), including the headquarter of the Liaison Office (91 meters). UNESCO then issued a warning to the Macau government, which led former Chief Executive [[Edmund Ho]] to sign a notice regulating height restrictions on buildings around the site.&lt;ref name="mdt2016"/&gt; In 2015, the [[New Macau Association]] submitted a report to [[UNESCO]] claiming that the government had failed to protect Macao's cultural heritage against threats by urban development projects. One of the main examples of the report is that the headquarter of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, which is located on the Guia foothill and obstructs the view of the [[Guia Fortress]] (one of the [[world heritage]]s symbols of Macao). One year later, Roni Amelan, a spokesman from UNESCO Press service, said that the UNESCO has asked China for information and is still waiting for a reply.&lt;ref&gt;Meneses, J. (2016).

Macau Business, July 2016, pp.72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mdt2016"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/new-macau-alerts-un-construction-project-near-lighthouse.html|title=New Macau alerts UN to construction project near lighthouse|last=|first=|date=November 8, 2016|work=Macau Daily Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Macau government approved an 81-meter construction limit for the residential project, which reportedly goes against the city’s regulations on the height of buildings around world heritage site Guia Lighthouse.&lt;ref name="mdt2016"/&gt;

===Cuisine===
Local cooking in Macau consists of a blend of [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]] and [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] cuisines.

Its ingredients and seasonings include those from Europe, South America, Africa, India, and Southeast Asia, as well as local Chinese ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisthelife.com/en/macanese-cuisine.htm |title=Macanese Cuisine |accessdate=4 January 2008 |publisher=thisisthelife.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071223080418/http://www.thisisthelife.com/en/macanese-cuisine.htm |archivedate = 23 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, Macanese food is seasoned with various spices and flavours including [[turmeric]], [[coconut milk]], [[cinnamon]] and [[bacalhau]], giving special aromas and tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arscives.com/bladesign/macau.discovered.htm |title=Discovering Macau&amp;nbsp;– fabulous food spice route and early fusion cuisine |accessdate=7 June 2007 |publisher=Discovery.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002754/http://www.arscives.com/bladesign/macau.discovered.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous dishes include minchi, capella, [[galinha à Portuguesa]], galinha à Africana (African chicken), [[bacalhau]], Macanese chili shrimps and [[stir-fry]] curry crab.

'''Mata Kaulan'''(ਕੌਲਾਂ) is believed to be a spiritual woman who lived during time of [[Guru Hargobind Sahib]], the 6th [[Sikh gurus|Sikh Guru]]. Kaulan means the ''one who is Living in abode of Lotus''.&lt;ref&gt;ਕਉਲਾ - kaulā - कउलाਸੰ. ਕਮਲਾ. ਸੰਗ੍ਯਾ- ਲਕ੍ਸ਼੍‍ਮੀ, ਜਿਸ ਦਾ ਨਿਵਾਸ ਕਮਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਮੰਨਿਆ ਹੈ. "ਸੇਵੇ ਚਰਨ ਨਿਤ ਕਉਲਾ." (ਵਾਰ ਕਾਨ ਮਃ ੪), Mahankosh, Kahn Singh Nabha&lt;/ref&gt; There is dispute among historians regarding Mata Kaulan and her relation to Guru Hargobind. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Patishahi 6, Twarikh Guru Khalsa, Giani Gian Singh, Section:Kolan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mahankosh"&gt;ਕੌਲਾਂ, ਕੌਲਸਰ, Mahankosh, Kahn Singh Nabha&lt;/ref&gt; believed her to have been the wife of Guru Hargobind, where others believe that she was his servant. Scholars commonly hold the viewpoint that she was a true disciple of Guru Hargobind and spent her life under directions of the Guru. Another viewpoint is that Kaulan is a mythical woman and story that was created during [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s regime to annoy [[Muslims]].

'''Mikhail Naumovich Epstein''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Нау́мович Эпште́йн}}; or Epshtein, born April 21, 1950) is a Russian-American literary theorist and critical thinker. Mikhail Epstein is Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Cultural Theory and Russian Literature at Emory University, USA. He worked as Professor of Russian and Cultural Theory at Durham University, UK, in 2012–2015. He moved from the USSR (Moscow) to the USA (Atlanta) in 1990 and from the USA to England (Durham) in 2012 and then back to Atlanta, to resume teaching at Emory, in 2015. He was founder and director of Centre for Humanities Innovation at Durham University &lt;ref&gt;[Centre for Humanities Innovation at Durham University] [https://www.dur.ac.uk/chi/]&lt;/ref&gt; (2012–2015).

His areas of specialization include [[postmodernism]], cultural and literary theory; the history of [[Russian literature]]  (particularly Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Platonov and 20th century poetry) and intellectual history; contemporary philosophical and religious thought;  new methods and interdisciplinary approaches in the humanities; semiotics, language evolution and neologisms; and ideas and electronic media. Professor Epstein is also an expert on Russian philosophy of the 19th and 20th century and on thinkers like [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]. He writes essays on cultural, social, ethical and international issues.

==Biography==
Epstein was born in [[Moscow]], of [[Jew]]ish heritage. He graduated from the philological faculty of Moscow State University in 1972. He was a member of Soviet Writers Union since 1978 and the founder and director of the Laboratory of Contemporary Culture in Moscow (1988–89).

He moved to the USA in 1990 and was fellow of Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ([[Washington D.C.]]) in 1990–1991. He joined Emory faculty in 1990. In 1992–1994 he received grant from National Council for Soviet and East European Research to work on the history of Russian thought of the late Soviet period. He has authored InteLnet (Intellectual network, 1995) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/intelnet2.html inteLnet]&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other interdisciplinary web sites in the humanities.

One of his major continuing  projects is "On the Future of the Humanities: Paradigmatic Shifts and Emerging Concepts" on which he worked as an inaugural senior fellow at the Center for Humanistic Inquiry (Emory University, 2002–03)and as a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study at Durham University (2011). He had visiting professor appointments at Wesleyan University (1990) and University of Oregon at  Eugene (2002).

Mikhail Epstein has won national and international prizes, including Andrei Bely prize ([[St. Petersburg]], 1991); The Social Innovations Award 1995 from the Institute for Social Inventions (London) for his electronic Bank of New Ideas; the International Essay Contest set up by [[Lettre International]] and Weimar – Cultural City of Europe 1999; and Liberty Prize, awarded for his outstanding contribution in the development of Russian-American cultural connections (New York, 2000).

Epstein maintains blogs on "Facebook", "Snob" and "Live Journal" networks, where, in particular, since 2007 he conducts and reports "СЛОВО ГОДА" – a [[Word of the year (Russia)|Russian-language "Word of the Year"]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://snob.ru/profile/27356/blog/101993 "СЛОВО ГОДА-2015. ИТОГИ ВЫБОРОВ" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas and Terms==

In the realm of [[aesthetics]], Epstein (together with poet and conceptual artist [[Dmitry Prigov]]) is credited with introducing the concept of "[[new sincerity]]" (''novaia iskrennost'') as a response to the dominant sense of absurdity in late [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[post-Soviet]] culture.&lt;ref name="Yurchak"&gt;[[Alexei Yurchak]], "Post-Post-Communist Sincerity: Pioneers, Cosmonauts, and Other Soviet Heroes Born Today," in Thomas Lahusen and Peter H. Solomon, eds., ''What Is Soviet Now?: Identities, Legacies, Memories'' (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2008), {{ISBN|978-3-8258-0640-8}}, p.258-59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3GonhERyzwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA258,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Epstein's words, "Postconceptualism, or the New Sincerity, is an experiment in resuscitating "fallen," dead languages with a renewed pathos of love, sentimentality and enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Epstein, "A Catalogue of New Poetries," in Mikhail Epstein, Aleksandr Genis, Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, eds., ''Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture'' (Berghahn Books, 1999), {{ISBN|978-1-57181-098-4}}, p. 146, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5qjzj3JwaoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA146,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his exploration of contemporary spirituality, Epstein focuses on the concept of "post-atheism," or "minimal [or poor] religion," discussed in particular in his correspondence with the Protestant thinker Thomas Altizer and extensively examined in Charles Taylor's book "The Secular Age" (2007) that refers to Epstein's innovative work.

Mikhail Epstein has coined a number of new concepts and terms (in English and in Russian) that now circulate on tens of thousands of websites in various branches of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|title=The Transformative Humanities: A Manifesto|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-6094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Greek myth (personified)}}
'''Momus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|m|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Μῶμος}} ''Momos'') was in [[Greek mythology]] the personification of [[satire]] and mockery, two stories about whom figure among [[Aesop’s Fables]]. During the [[Renaissance]], several literary works used him as a mouthpiece for their criticism of tyranny, while others later made him a critic of contemporary society. Onstage he finally became the figure of harmless fun.

==In classical literature==
As a sharp-tongued spirit of unfair criticism, Momus was eventually expelled from the company of the gods on [[Greek mythology#Greek pantheon|Mount Olympus]]. His name is related to {{lang|grc|μομφή}}, meaning 'blame', 'reproach', or 'disgrace'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=%CE%9C%E1%BF%B6%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;la=greek#lexicon Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek-English Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesiod]] said that Momus was a son of Night ([[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]]), “though she lay with none”, and the twin of the misery goddess [[Oizys]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm ''Theogony'' 214]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century BCE epic ''[[Cypria]]'', Momus was credited with stirring up the [[Trojan War]] in order to reduce the human population.&lt;ref&gt;David Marsh, ''Lucian and the Latins'', University of Michigan 1998, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sLXWYW32neQC&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;ots=bG1XrPYgRy&amp;dq=Cypria%20%20%22Momus%22&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=Cypria%20%20%22Momus%22&amp;f=false p.116]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sophocles]] wrote a later [[satyr play]] called ''Momos'', now almost entirely lost, which may have derived from this.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Ferris Sutton, “A handlist of satyr plays”, ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' vo.78 (1974), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VyX-xjSHMmcC&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;ots=8mpeL2Bxgy&amp;dq=Momos%20%20Sophocles&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q=Momos%20%20Sophocles&amp;f=false p.112]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1561 v. Heemskerck Momus tadelt die Werke der Goetter.JPG|thumb|upright=1.28|''Momus Criticizes the Gods' Creations'', by [[Maarten van Heemskerck]], 1561, [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]
Two of [[Aesop's fables]] feature the god. The most widely reported of these in Classical times is numbered 100 in the [[Perry Index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/100.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; There Momus is asked to judge the handiwork of three gods (who vary depending on the version): a man, a house and a bull. He found all at fault: the man because his heart was not on view to judge his thoughts; the house because it had no wheels so as to avoid troublesome neighbours; and the bull because it did not have eyes in its horns to guide it when charging.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francisco Rodríguez Adrados]], ''History of the Graeco-latin Fable'', Vol.3, Brill NL 2003, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BHScT2Dd3ykC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q=Momus&amp;f=false pp.131-3]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of it, [[Plutarch]] and [[Aristotle]] criticized Aesop’s story-telling as deficient in understanding, while [[Lucian]] insisted that anyone with sense was able to sound out a man’s thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;''Hermotimus or the Rival Philosophies'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl2/wl205.htm p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;

As another result, Momus became a by-word for fault-finding, and the saying that if not even he could criticize something then that was the sign of its perfection. Thus a poem in the [[Greek Anthology]] remarks of statues by [[Praxiteles]] that “Momus himself will cry out, 'Father Zeus, this was perfect skill'.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loebclassics.com/view/greek_anthology_16/1918/pb_LCL086.315.xml 16.262]&lt;/ref&gt; Looking the lovely Aphrodite over, according to a second fable of Aesop’s, number 455 in the Perry Index, it was light-heartedly noted that he could not find anything about her to fault except that her sandals squeaked.&lt;ref&gt;Adrados, pp.512-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political satire==
A social comedy from the 2nd century CE served as inspiration for later criticisms of society. This was found in Lucian’s “The Gods in Council”, in which Momus takes a leading role in a discussion on how to purge Olympus of foreign gods and barbarian demi-gods who are lowering its heavenly tone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl430.htm Sacred Texts]&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the Renaissance, [[Leon Battista Alberti]] wrote the political work ''Momus or The Prince'' (1446), which continued the god’s story after his exile to earth.  Since his continued criticism of the gods was destabilizing the divine establishment, Jupiter bound him to a rock and had him castrated. Later, however, missing his candor, he sought out a manuscript that Momus had left behind in which was described how a land could be ruled with strictly regulated justice.&lt;ref&gt;David Cast, “Marten van Heemskerck’s ‘Momus criticizing the work of the gods’: a problem of Erasmian iconography. ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', Volume 7.1 (1974), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=88_3CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;ots=S8kKNdzBSK&amp;dq=Erasmus%2C%20Adagia%2C%20%22Momus%22&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q=Erasmus,%20Adagia,%20%22Momus%22&amp;f=false pp.25]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 16th century, [[Erasmus]] also presented Momus as a champion of legitimate criticism of authorities. Allowing that the god was “not quite as popular as others, because few people freely admit criticism, yet I dare say of the whole crowd of gods celebrated by the poets, none was more useful.”&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Mann Phillips, ''The Adages of Erasmus: A Study with Translations'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EDg9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;ots=l_VzEJKym8&amp;dq=Erasmus%2C%20Adagia%2C%20%22Momus%22&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=Erasmus,%20Adagia,%20%22Momus%22&amp;f=false pp.34-5]&lt;/ref&gt; Giordano Bruno's philosophical treatise ''The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast'' (1584)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ggJeAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Spaccio della bestia trionfante. Or the Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast], translated by William Morehead, London 1713&lt;/ref&gt; also looks back to Lucian’s example. Momus there plays an integral part in the series of dialogues conducted by the Olympian deities and Bruno's narrators as Jupiter seeks to purge the universe of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Henry Popkin, ''The Columbia History of Western Philosophy'', Columbia University 2013, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TE021UmMiAsC&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;ots=FcE-H9_cpv&amp;dq=Bruno%20%22The%20Expulsion%20of%20the%20Triumphant%20Beast%22&amp;pg=PA321#v=onepage&amp;q=Bruno%20%22The%20Expulsion%20of%20the%20Triumphant%20Beast%22&amp;f=false pp.320-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social satire==
17th century English writers introduced the figure of Momus in a gentler spirit of fun, as in [[Thomas Carew]]’s masque ''Coelum Britannicum'' (1634), which was acted before King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and his court. There too Momus and Mercury draw up a plan to reform the ‘[[Star Chamber]]’ of Heaven. Two centuries on, it was to influence [[Henry David Thoreau]] as he was preparing to write his [[Walden]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Grey, ''The Complicity of Imagination: The American Renaissance, Contests of Authority, and Seventeenth-Century English Culture'', Cambridge University 2009, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2E8joaumCnsC&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;ots=E1mcszrGiE&amp;dq=depictions%20of%20Momus&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=depictions%20of%20Momus&amp;f=false pp.133-6]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dryden]]’s short “Secular Masque” (1700) mocks contemporary society through the medium of the Classical divinities, with Momus playing a leading part in deflating with sarcastic wit the sports represented by Diana (hunting), Mars (war), and Venus (love), for “'Tis better to laugh than to cry”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://britlitwiki.wikispaces.com/The+Secular+Masque British Literature Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt; It is with similar wryness that [[Carl Sandburg]]’s statue of “Momus” (1914) surveys the never-changing human scene, “On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history”, as they continue to overpopulate the world and then bleed it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/2050 Poetry Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy==
[[File:Momus Tarot.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|"The Fool" (Momus), on an 18th-century playing card]] 
Elsewhere in Europe, Momus was becoming softened into a figure of light-hearted and sentimental comedy, the equivalent of [[Harlequin]] in the French and Italian ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Derek F. Connon, ''Identity and Transformation in the Plays of Alexis Piron'', London 2007, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w36s4EjIPdMC&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;ots=0xXvbubEwU&amp;dq=momus%20theatre&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q=momus%20theatre&amp;f=false pp.125-6]&lt;/ref&gt; A typical production has him competing for the amorous favours of a nymph in [[Henry Desmarets]]’ opéra-ballet ''Les amours de Momus'' (1695).&lt;ref&gt;French language outline [http://operabaroque.fr/DESMAREST_MOMUS.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

By this period, then, Momus was the patron of humorous satire, partnering the figures of [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. As such he appeared flanked by these female figures on the frontispiece to ''The Beauties of the English Stage'' (1737),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=840180001&amp;objectId=3287471&amp;partId=1 British Museum prints]&lt;/ref&gt; while in Leonard Defraine’s ''Figures of Fabled Gods'' (1820), he partners [[Comus]], god of [[Carnival]], and [[Themis]], patroness of assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Comus-Themis-and-Momus-Greek-Gods-Posters_i10656207_.htm Allposters]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the Harlequin connection, too, and as the character able to make home-truths palatable through the use of humour, Momus had now taken the place of the [[Jester|Fool]] on the French [[Minchiate]] card pack. He also lent his name to [[George Saville Carey]]’s satirical poem, ''Momus, or a critical examination into the merits of the performers and comic pieces at the Theatre-Royal in the Hay-Market'' (1767).&lt;ref&gt;Text  [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004807208.0001.000/1:2?rgn=div1;view=fulltext online]&lt;/ref&gt; The god himself plays no part there, only “Momus’ sons”, the comic actors.

==Biography==
Nirmal Chandra Sinha was born in 1911 in [[Ranchi]] in the Indian state of [[Jharkhand]], formerly in [[Bihar]].&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Socanth obituary" /&gt; After securing a master's degree from the [[Presidency College, Calcutta]], he joined as a member of faculty of [[Hooghly Mohsin College]], in [[Chinsurah]], [[West Bengal]]&lt;ref name="Hooghly Mohsin College"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hooghlymohsincollege.org/departments/arts/history/ | title=Hooghly Mohsin College | publisher=Hooghly Mohsin College | date=2015 | accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later, as a professor of history at Behrampur College before joining the government service and was appointed as the cultural attache at the political office (residency) in 1955.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Socanth obituary" /&gt; Working as the attache, he toured Tibet in 1956 as a member of the Indian delegation that toured the country for inviting [[Dalai Lama]]. Thereafter, he worked at the Indian Archive where he had the opportunity to work under renowned educationist and former Union Minister of Education, [[Triguna Sen]].&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Socanth obituary" /&gt; In 1958, when the Sikkim Research Institute of Tibetology, present day [[Namgyal Institute of Tibetology]] (NIT), was established, Sinha was appointed as its founder director.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Socanth obituary" /&gt; He worked there till his retirement in 1987 after which he moved to Siliguri and took up the post as the Centenary Professor of International Relations at the [[University of Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Socanth obituary" /&gt;

During his tenure as the director of NIT, Sinha contributed significantly to the ''Bulletin of Tibetology'', a bi-annual publication by the institute.&lt;ref name="NIT Bulletin of Tibetology"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/collections/journals/bot/nonjavascript.php | title=NIT Bulletin of Tibetology | publisher=University of Cambridge | date=2015 | accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a scholar of many languages such as [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] which helped him in his writings.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Socanth obituary" /&gt; He wrote several articles in [[Sikkim Express]] and Gangtok Times and his last article, ''Lenin and Biddhism'', written in July 1997 was published in the latter.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Socanth obituary" /&gt; He also published a book, ''Indian war economy'', in 1962, co-written with P. N. Khera.&lt;ref name="Indian war economy"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Indian_War_Economy.html?id=YaMZAAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y | title=Indian war economy: Supply, Industry &amp; Finance | publisher=Orient Longmans | author=Nirmal Chandra Sinha, P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5572">The '''No–no paradox''' is a distinctive [[paradox]] belonging to the family of the [[semantics|semantic]] paradoxes (like the [[Liar paradox]]). It derives its name from the fact that it consists of two sentences each simply denying what the other says.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==

A variation on the paradox occurs already in [[Thomas Bradwardine]]’s ''Insolubilia''.&lt;ref&gt;Bradwardine, T. (1970), ''Insolubilia'', pp. 304–305, in Roure, M.-L. (1970). ‘La problématique des propositions insolubles au XIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle et au début du XIV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;, suivie de l’édition des traités de W. Shyreswood, W. Burleigh et Th. Bradwardine’, ''Archives d’Histoire Doctrinale et Littéraire du Moyen Âge'' '''37''', pp. 205–326.&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox itself appears as the eighth sophism of chapter 8 of [[John Buridan]]’s ''Sophismata''.&lt;ref&gt;Buridan, J. (2001), ''Summulae de Dialectica'', tr. G. Klima, New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 971.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the paradox has gone largely unnoticed even in the course of the 20th-century revival of the semantic paradoxes, it has recently been rediscovered (and dubbed with its current name) by the US philosopher [[Roy Sorensen]],&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, R. (2001), ''Vagueness and Contradiction'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now appreciated for the distinctive difficulties it presents.&lt;ref&gt;Greenough, P. (2011), 'Truthmaker gaps and the no-no paradox', ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'' '''82''', pp. 547–563.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation==

The notion of [[truth]] seems to be governed by the naive schema:

:(T): The sentence ' ''P'' ' is true if and only if ''P''

(where we use single quotes to refer to the linguistic expression inside the quotes). Consider however the two sentences:

:(N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true

:(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true

Reasoning in [[classical logic]], there are four possibilities concerning (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):

# Both (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are true
# Both (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are not true
# (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is true and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true
# (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is true

Yet, possibilities 1. and 2. are ruled out by the instances of (T) for (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). To wit, possibility 1. is ruled out because, if (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is true, then, by (T), (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true; possibility 2. is ruled out because, if (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true, then, by (T), (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is true. It would then seem that either of possibilities 3. and 4. should obtain. Yet, both of those possibilities would also seem repugnant, as, on each of them, two perfectly symmetrical sentences would mysteriously diverge in [[truth value]].

==Discussion==

Generally speaking, the paradox instantiates the problem of determining the status of ungrounded sentences that are not [[consistency|inconsistent]].&lt;ref&gt;Herzberger, H. (1970), 'Paradoxes of grounding in semantics', ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''67''', pp. 145–167&lt;/ref&gt; More in particular, the paradox presents the challenge of expanding one’s favourite theory of truth with further principles which either express the symmetry intuition against possibilities 3. and 4.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, G. (2005), 'Words without knowledge', ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'' '''71''', pp. 686–694.&lt;/ref&gt; or make them acceptable in spite of their intuitive repugnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, R. (2001), ''Vagueness and Contradiction'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 165–184.&lt;/ref&gt; Because (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) do not lead to inconsistency, a certain strand in the discussion of the paradox has been willing to assume both the relevant instances of (T) and classical logic, thereby deriving the conclusion that either possibility 3. or possibility 4. holds.&lt;ref&gt;Armour-Garb, B. and J. Woodbridge (2006), 'Dialetheism, semantic pathology, and the open pair', ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'' '''84''', pp. 395–416.&lt;/ref&gt; Such conclusion has in turn been taken to have momentous consequences for certain influential philosophical theses. Consider, for example, the thesis of [[truthmaker]] maximalism:

:(TM): If a sentence is true, there is something that makes it true&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, D. (2004), ''Truth and Truth-Makers'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

If, as per possibilities 3. and 4., one of (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is true and the other one is not true, then, given the symmetry between the two sentences, it might seem that there is nothing that makes true whichever of the two is in fact true. If so, (TM) would fail.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, R. (2001), ''Vagueness and Contradiction'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; These and similar conclusions have however been contested by other philosophers on the grounds that, as evidenced by [[Curry's paradox]], joint reliance on (T) and classical logic might be problematic even when it does not lead to inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;López de Sa, D. and E. Zardini (2007), 'Truthmakers, knowledge and paradox', ''Analysis'' '''67''', pp. 242–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1270">[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - The Remorse of Orestes (1862).jpg|thumb|250px|by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] (Also known as ''The Remorse of Orestes'')]]
'''Orestes Pursued by the Furies''' is an event from Greek mythology that is a recurring theme in art depicting [[Orestes]].

==Background==
In the [[The Iliad|''Iliad'']], the king of Argos, [[Agamemnon]], sacrifices his daughter [[Iphigenia]] to the Gods to assure good sailing weather to Troy. 
[[File:Singer Sargent, John - Orestes Pursued by the Furies - 1921.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|by [[John Singer Sargent]]]]
In  ''Agamemnon'', the first play of [[Aeschylus]]'s [[Oresteia]] trilogy, Agamemnon is murdered by his wife, [[Clytemnestra]], and her lover, Aegisthus as revenge for sacrificing Iphigenia. In ''The Libation Bearers'', the second play of the Orestia, Agamemnon's son Orestes returns home to take revenge on his mother for murdering his father. 

Orestes ultimately does murder his mother, and afterward is tormented by [[Erinyes|The Furies]], beings who personify the anger of the dead.

==In Art==
Orestes being tormented by the Furies has been depicted by a number of artists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3315">The '''Pecos Conference''' is an annual conference of [[archaeologist]]s that is held in the southwestern [[United States]] or northern [[Mexico]].

Each August, archaeologists gather under open skies somewhere in the southwestern United States or northern Mexico. They set up a large tent for shade, and then spend three or more days together discussing recent research and the problems of the field and challenges of the profession. In recent years, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], avocational archaeologists, the general public and media organizations have come to speak with the archaeologists. These individuals and groups play an increasingly important role, as participants and as audience, helping professional archaeologists celebrate archaeological research and to mark cultural continuity.

First inspired and organized by [[Alfred V. Kidder|A.V. Kidder]] at [[Pecos, New Mexico|Pecos]], [[New Mexico]], in 1927, the Pecos Conference had no formal organization or permanent leadership until 2016. That year the conference joined Southwestern Archaeology Inc. and became a 501.c.3 nonprofit. Until then, professional archaeologists still found ways to organize themselves to meet at a new conference location each summer, mostly because they understand the problems of working in isolation in the field and the importance of face time with colleagues. To make progress with objective science and with other cultural matters, books and journal articles are important, but one still must look colleagues in the eye and work out the details of one's research in cooperative and contentious forums.

Open to all, the Pecos Conference remains an important opportunity for student archaeologists and avocational students of prehistory to meet with professional archaeologists on a one-on-one informal basis to learn about the profession, gain access to resources and new research opportunities, and to test new methods and theories related to archaeology. The conference features two days of papers, panels and discussion groups, as well as poster presentations, book sales and souvenirs. The Cordell-Powers Prize competition rewards young archaeologists, based on the quality of their presentations at the conference. A third day is devoted to tours of important archaeological sites, led by archaeologists who are working at that location or are highly knowledgeable about the area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5126">The '''qirad''' was one of the basic financial instruments of the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]].  It was an arrangement between one or more investors and an agent where the investors entrusted capital to an agent who then traded with it in hopes of making profit.  Both parties then received a previously settled portion of the profit, though the agent was not liable for any losses.

== Origins and history ==
Although the qirad is never mentioned in the [[Qur'an]], many Islamic traditions attribute its origin to the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and his companions.  These traditions describe [[Muhammad]] and his companions either using the qirad or endorsing the institution &lt;ref&gt;Avram Udovitch, "Partnership and Profit in Medieval Islam", (Princeton University Press, 1970) p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Many will notice that the qirad is almost identical to the institution of the [[Limited partnership|commenda]] later used in western Europe, though whether the qirad transformed into the commenda, or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Hillman, "Limited Liability in Historical Perspective", (Washington and Lee Law Review, Spring 1997), Benedikt Koehler, "Islamic Finance as a Progenitor of Venture Capital", (Economic Affairs, December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal technicalities ==
Though there existed several different major schools of Islamic law, the basic legalities of the qirad were rather uniform throughout the schools.

[[Dinars]] and [[dirhams]], as well as gold, silver, and copper coins in circulation were allowed to be invested.  However, goods such as barley were restricted from the qirad because the possible fluctuations in their value in the free market.&lt;ref&gt;Udovitch op cit pp. 177-181&lt;/ref&gt;

The agent was allowed to take the investment and split up his investments in any way, as well as invest in anything he wanted,&lt;ref&gt;Malik ibn Anas, al-Muwatta', 280-282 (Kegan Paul International, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; except in cases where stocks are plentiful and not seasonally bound.&lt;ref name=MM3235&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.3.5 Malik's Muwatta 32.3.5]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also permissible for an investor to forbid the agent from buying certain kinds of goods.&lt;ref name=MM3235/&gt; Many of the third parties involved in the qirad were actually unaware of their involvement which allowed the agent to trade freely and without liability.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the fractional split in profit was agreed on beforehand, the investor could not stipulate a specific sum of the money from the profit, or that a certain profit be made.  In this way, the qirad remained a complete risk on the investor and did not infringe on the free market economy.,&lt;ref&gt;Udovitch op cit, pp. 190-193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malik op cit&lt;/ref&gt; It was however possible to make a deal on the split of the profit beforehand by stipulating a specific percentage. This could be either a low or a high percentage.&lt;ref name=MM3235/&gt;

The principal investment can not be paid back, either by the investor ending the agreement, or the agent ending the agreement, if the principal is still invested in goods. The goods must be sold before the principal can be handed back, and the profits split.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.4.6 Malik's Muwatta 32.4.6]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the investor is allowed to buy goods from the agent if he does not connect any conditions to this transaction.&lt;ref name=MM3223&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.2.3 Malik's Muwatta 32.2.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The agent can also ask the help of a servant of the investor, but this servant also has to share in the profit and can not be asked to do any other work than work connected to the investment.&lt;ref name=MM3235/&gt; A servant can also invest in the same investment as his master and also shares in the profit.&lt;ref name=MM3223/&gt;

If the agent has to hire help for a job, the wage for this person can be paid from the principal, except if the wage should result in loss for the investor, the agent himself is responsible for whatever is not covered by the principal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.6.8 Malik's Muwatta 32.6.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

The agent can use the principal for food and clothes if he should travel for his business, and the principal is large enough to allow it. If he stays at home this is not allowed.&lt;ref name=MM3223/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.8.10 Malik's Muwatta 32.8.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

An agent can invest the money of an investor, the agent then becomes an investor himself, but he is then liable for the losses of the second agent. If the principal decreases, the original investor is allowed to ask the original agent to cover the loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.7.9 Malik's Muwatta 32.7.9]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stand Together Against Neighborhood Drilling (STAND-L.A.)''' is an [[environmental justice]] coalition of community groups that seeks to end neighborhood drilling in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The coalition hopes to establish a human health buffer around existing oil wells in Los Angeles to protect the health and safety of Angelenos affected by urban oil extraction.

== Background ==

STAND-L.A. was founded in 2013 but came together officially in 2014{{clarify|date=April 2016}} under the name STAND-L.A.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stand.la/about-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes around several urban oil sites, including the [[Inglewood Oil Field]], [[Wilmington Oil Field]], and [[Porter Ranch, Los Angeles|Porter Ranch]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stand.la/urban-drilling-sites-in-los-angeles.html&lt;/ref&gt; These oil extraction sites operate in the neighborhoods of coalition members, their families, and their children.

STAND-L.A.’s founding members include:
* [[Communities for a Better Environment]]&lt;ref name="CBE"&gt;[http://www.cbecal.org/ CBE Communities for a Better Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Esperanza Community Housing Corporation&lt;ref name="ECHC"&gt;[http://www.esperanzacommunityhousing.org/ Esperanza Community Housing Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Holman United Methodist Church&lt;ref name="HUMC"&gt;[http://www.holmanumc.com/ Holman United Methodist Church]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Liberty Hill Foundation]]&lt;ref name="LHF"&gt;[https://www.libertyhill.org/ Liberty Hill Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Physicians for Social Responsibility|Physicians for Social Responsibility – Los Angeles]]&lt;ref name="PSR"&gt;[http://www.psr-la.org/ Physicians for Social Responsibility]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Redeemer Community Partnership&lt;ref name="RCP"&gt;[http://www.redeemercp.org/ Redeemer Community Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues and Campaigns ==

=== Health Impacts of Neighborhood Drilling ===
The coalition focuses on raising awareness about the health and safety threats associated with neighborhood drilling and advocates for the implementation of a health and safety buffer around active oil wells in their communities.

In folklore, a [[bullet]] cast from [[silver]] is often the only weapon that is effective against a [[werewolf]], [[witch]], or other [[monster]]s. The term is also a metaphor for a simple, seemingly magical, solution to a difficult problem: for example, [[penicillin]] was a silver bullet that cured many bacterial infections.

==In folklore==
*The idea of the [[werewolf]]'s supposed vulnerability to silver probably dates back to the legend of the [[Beast of Gévaudan]], in which a gigantic wolf is killed by a hunter with the name of "Argent" which comes from the Latin word for silver, wielding a gun loaded with silver bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Jackson|year=1995|title=Witchcraft and the Occult|publisher=Devizes, Quintet Publishing|page=25|isbn=1-85348-888-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy-tale of ''[[The Two Brothers]]'', a bullet-proof witch is shot down by silver buttons, fired from a gun.
*In some epic folk songs about [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] rebel leader [[Delyo]], he is described as invulnerable to normal weapons, driving his enemies to cast a silver bullet in order to murder him.&lt;ref name="narodna"&gt;{{cite book|last=Стойкова|first=Стефана|title=Българска народна поезия и проза в седем тома.|publisher=ЕИ "LiterNet"|location=Варна|volume= Т. III. Хайдушки и исторически песни|chapter=Дельо хайдутин|isbn=978-954-304-232-6|url=http://liternet.bg/folklor/sbornici/bnpp/haidushki/content.htm|chapterurl=http://liternet.bg/folklor/sbornici/bnpp/haidushki/58.htm|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Lone Ranger==
Silver bullets also act as a calling card for [[The Lone Ranger]] in his adventures. The masked man decided to use bullets forged from the precious metal as a symbol of justice, law and order, and to remind himself and others that life, like silver, has value and is not to be wasted or thrown away. In the 3rd episode, his friend, who will be making his bullets for him, mentions killing villains with the bullets and the Lone Ranger explains that he will not shoot to kill; he will let the law dispense justice. The silver bullets will be as symbols of justice. Whether he actually used silver bullets in his guns varies depending on story and medium. In the radio series, the Lone Ranger used only lead bullets as weapons, while the silver bullets were used symbolically. In the [[The Legend of the Lone Ranger|1981 feature film]], The Lone Ranger used silver bullets in his guns as he was told that silver was far more solid than lead slugs and provided a straighter shot. The Lone Ranger's usage of bullet made from valuable metal like silver is satirized in an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' where after expertly shooting a tin can in the air, the Ranger's sidekick Tonto laments that the amount of silver the Ranger thoughtlessly wasted could have bought enough food to feed Tonto's entire village for a year.

==Ballistic effectiveness==
Silver bullets differ from lead bullets in several respects. [[Lead]] has a 10% higher density than [[silver]], so a silver bullet will have a little less mass than a lead bullet of identical dimensions. Pure silver is less [[malleable]] than lead and falls between [[lead]] and [[copper]] in terms of hardness (1.5 &lt; '''2.5''' &lt; 3.0 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs]]) and [[shear modulus]] (5.6 &lt; '''30''' &lt; 48 GPa). A silver bullet accepts the [[rifling]] of a gun barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.patriciabriggs.com/articles/silver/silverbullet14.shtml | title = History Channel Shoot | first = Michael | last = Briggs | date = September 2008 | publisher = Patricia Briggs | accessdate = January 25, 2017 | quotation = In this photo, you can see the marks the rifling in the barrel left on the bullet when it was fired. I'd like to see a little more on the nose, but the driving bands show very nice engraving.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminal impact is somewhat speculative and will depend on a variety of factors including bullet size and shape, flight distance, and target material. At short ranges, the silver bullet will most likely give better penetration due to its higher shear modulus, and will not deform as much as a lead bullet. A 2007 episode of ''[[MythBusters]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url = http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-silver-vs-lead-bullets.html | title = Mythbusters: Silver vs. Lead Bullets | date = 2007 | medium = Television production | publisher = The Discovery Channel | accessdate = January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated a greater penetration depth of lead bullets vs. silver bullets. Results cannot be considered conclusive, however, as the show utilized a 250-[[Grain (unit)|grain]] lead slug in a [[.45LC|.45-caliber Colt long]] shell vs a lighter (190-grain) silver slug fired at closer range. Another ''MythBusters'' episode, from 2012, showed that silver bullets are less accurate than lead bullets when fired from the M1 Garand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url = http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/hollywood-gunslingers/ | title = Mythbusters: Hollywood Gunslingers | date = June 17, 2012 | medium = Television production | publisher = The Discovery Channel | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Briggs also did some experiments with silver bullets compared to lead bullets. After making a custom mold to ensure that the sizes of the silver bullets were comparable to the lead bullets, he fired them. He found that the silver bullets were slightly slower than the lead bullets and less accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.patriciabriggs.com/books/silver/silverbullets.shtml | title = Silver Bullets | first = Michael | last = Briggs | date = | publisher = Patricia Briggs | accessdate = January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social constructionism]], a branch of [[sociology]], queries commonly held views on the nature of reality, touching on themes of normality and abnormality within the context of power and oppression in societal structures.
The concept of a '''social construction of schizophrenia''', within a social construction of health and illness notary form, denotes that the label of 'schizophrenia' is one that has been socially constructed through ideological systems, none of which are truly [[empirical]] especially as currently there is no definitive evidence as to the cause(s) of [[schizophrenia]].

==Introduction==
In 1966, Berger and Luckman coined the term ''social constructionism'' in their work ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''. In summary it examines the basis of fact and truth / knowledge within culture. Whilst some 'truths' such as 'fire is hot' are universally agreed as objective, many others considered 'fact' are the result of a common subjective experience and the subsequent validation of that.

Walker has argued that psychiatric diagnoses are nothing but linguistic abstractions. He has criticized the [[DSM-IV]]'s poor reliability and postulated that terms like 'schizophrenia' and 'mental illness' only exist by consensus and persist by convention. Further he argues that the pathologizing language which persists in the [[medical model of disability]] is unuseful in working towards a recovery model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Walker MT |year=2006 |title=The Social Construction of Mental Illness and its Implications for the Recovery Model |journal=International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=71–87 |url=http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_10/Social_Construction_of_MI_and_Implications_for_Recovery_Walker.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable practitioners and authors within the humanistic tradition that have viewed schizophrenia as a social construction include psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] (1920–2012), [[Joseph Berke]], [[R.D. Laing]], [[Erich Fromm]] and [[Mary Barnes]]. Szasz viewed the diagnoses as a fabrication that is borderline abusive in terms of treatment. Szasz has protested against the taxonomic classifications of mental illness and [[reification (fallacy)|reification]] of these as 'science' and has long argued against institutionalisation as a fundamental deprivation of liberty. In Berke's and Barnes's book ''two accounts of a journey through madness'', Berke explores themes of psychosis as an enriching experience. Berke argues that the invalidation of schizophrenic experiences labelled 'sick or mad' is a uniquely western standpoint insofar as dream states and altered perception are not considered valid modes of interpolation of the truth within westernised culture.&lt;ref name="BarnesBerke2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Barnes|author2=Joseph H. Berke|title=Mary Barnes: two accounts of a journey through madness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0BnPPdBKG4C|accessdate=23 October 2010|date=17 March 2002|publisher=Other Press, LLC|isbn=978-1-59051-016-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laing (1964) commented “the mad things done and said by the schizophrenic will remain essentially a closed book if one does not understand their existential context”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Roberts GA |year=2000 |title=Narrative and severe mental illness:what place do stories have in an evidence-based world? |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=6 |pages=432–441 |url=http://apt.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/6/6/432 |doi=10.1192/apt.6.6.432 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noll (1983) has explored the links between [[shamanism]] and schizophrenia, testing the research evidence on shamanism against the [[DSM-III]] diagnostic criterion. Though he draws comparisons between the two states of mind in terms of the phenomenon experienced, he draws out important differences between shamanic and schizophrenic states, notably that many people on the schizophrenic spectrum do not voluntarily enter an altered state of consciousness whereas research into shamanism unilaterally shows that shamanic states are induced and controlled voluntarily by the shaman, who ultimately maintains a healthy world view between a base line level of consciousness and an altered state of consciousness. He concludes that differences between schizophrenic and shamanic states such as 'volition', mean that the DSM-III cannot be used to define shamanism as the same state as schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Noll, Richard |year=1983 |title=Shamanism and Schizophrenia.A State-Specific approach to the 'Schizophrenia Metaphor of shamanic states' |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=443–459 |doi=10.1525/ae.1983.10.3.02a00030 |jstor=644263}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Sapolsky]] has theorized that shamanism is practiced by [[schizotypal]] individuals rather than schizophrenics.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Robert Sapolsky's lecture about Biological Underpinnings of Religiosity" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WwAQqWUkpI]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

===Philosophy===
Themes in social constructionism draw on various philosophies centred around the differences between objective reality or that which is known or absolute and subjective reality or that which is observed by the knower . In ''Schizophrenia: A scientific delusion'', Mary Boyle explores 'schizophrenia and its assumptions as truths or knowledges which are socially produced and managed'.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, M., 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5iRH0v093OgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=schizophrenia+a+scientific+delusion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tsadFgfZij&amp;sig=soBofdIPnjVWsQevC8Cb-A8juvA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5Vz-S9XMH6qg4QbJ-KiHDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Schizophrenia:A Scientific Delusion"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
Michael Walker examines the social construction of mental illness and its implications for the recovery model. He is critical of the user becoming defined by the definer, such as if you go for behavioural therapy you come out with a perspective of rewards and punishments etc.:

"Psychology, like psychiatry, has found ways of linguistically contorting, convoluting, and confusing lived experience with essential “truths” of its own. Bill O'Hanlon, a preeminent postmodern consultant and author, uses his holiday cookie making experience to
communicate what happens in the therapy room (O'Hanlon and Wiener-Davis, 1989). A client's problem that s/he brings to therapy is like cookie dough. The experience of it is vague and malleable. Once the "blob" of cookie dough is forced through the cookie press (a tube, funnel, and mold pressed against a baking pan) it becomes a Christmas tree, star, or Santa Claus. Similarly, when a client exposes his or her problem to a therapist it gets "molded" or interpreted in the language of the therapist. So a client attending a psychodynamic therapy session would leave having unresolved childhood conflicts. The same client leaving a behaviorist's office would walk away with problem behavior shaped by reward and punishment. An interaction with a Jungian therapist would result in the need to deal with the various archetypes that apply to him or her. Talking with a diagnostically (and thereby pathologically) minded clinician will leave one with the idea that they “have” “bipolar disorder”, “depression”, “obsessive compulsive disorder”, a “mental illness” – along with all the stories that go with them (“chemical imbalances”, lifelong duration, the need to “comply” with a treatment regimen, etc.). Like cookies, continued exposure to the "heat" of the theoretical lens causes these interpretations to "harden" or "reify" (to make real)." O'Hanlon concludes that if our languaging creates “the problem” then why not leverage the use of language and create a problem that is easiest to solve.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walker, Michael |year=2006 |title=The social construction of mental illness and it's implications for the recovery model |journal=Internanational journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=71–87 |url=http://www.recoverydevon.co.uk/download/The_Social_Construction_of_Mental_Illness.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213044735/http://www.recoverydevon.co.uk/download/The_Social_Construction_of_Mental_Illness.pdf |archivedate=13 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is critical of a deficit based vocabulary:

"From the perspective of linguistics we see that the reified categories (e.g. mental illness, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) are abstractions defined by clusters of what we call “symptoms.” Schizophrenia is defined as the presence of audio hallucinations (or other “thought disorders”) in the absence of a “mood disorder.” You can even throw in other correlates like “negative symptoms”, PET scans, response to medications, etc. The issue of the DSM's poor reliability and validity aside (Caplan, 1995; Sparks, Duncan, &amp; Miller, 2005), the term “schizophrenia” is a word used to communicate the presence of these “symptoms.” The various human manifestations of thought, feeling, and behavior (aka “symptoms”) exist like the chair you are sitting on as you read this exists. But the next level of abstraction, the word “schizophrenia”, and the next, “mental illness”, only exist through consensus and only persist by convention. Even if the correlations of defining symptoms was perfect (which it is far from), in light of the linguistic paradigm we have to ask ourselves whether using a pathologizing, deficit-based vocabulary is useful in helping people improve the quality of their lives."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Power and control===

Post Structuralist [[Jürgen Habermas]] examines questions of identity in the concept of societal integration and discusses how change occurs when there is a legitimation crisis. 
It assists the understanding of the social construction of schizophrenia and other illness in also understanding forces that shape power imbalances in aetiologies. Phil Brown in ''Naming and Framing : The social construction of diagnosis and illness'' points out how professionals were very slow and unwilling to accept the diagnosis of '[[Tardive dyskinesia]]', despite many research indicated warnings on it, as it was iatrogenic  (caused by) prescription drugs that had been plaudited to be successful in treatment of the associated condition of psychoses. Market forces in pharmacology and/or cultural embarrassment can shape the rate at which society adapts to include new frameworks such as those demonstrated in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brown, Phil |year=1995 |title=Naming and Framing : The Social construction of Diagnosis and Illness |journal=Journal of health and social behaviour |volume=35 |issue=extra issue |pages=34–52 |url=http://instituty.fsv.cuni.cz/~kabele/archiv/Mirek/SC_illness.pdf |doi=10.2307/2626956 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718170606/http://instituty.fsv.cuni.cz/~kabele/archiv/Mirek/SC_illness.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conrad writes on medicalization and social control. He looks at the process of science and medicalization . Science is heralded as the new religion in terms of ideological power and Conrad describes how medicalization can be used to police morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Conrad, Peter |year=1992 |title=Medicalization and social control |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=18|pages=209–232 |url=http://people.uncw.edu/ricej/deviance/Medicalization%20of%20Deviance,%20by%20Conrad%20and%20Schneider.pdf |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.18.1.209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The social construction of illness, key insights and policy implications", Conrad and Barker trace the history of the construction of illness from symbolic interactionists and medical sociologists and examine how society reacts in situations to the distinctions such as the construction of gender from sex and the construction of illness from disease :

"Framing anger in women as evidence of the disease PMS, to be treated with antidepressants, trivializes the impact of gender inequality on women’s daily lives. And when difficulties in children’s attention and behavior get defined as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), school policies increasingly encourage the use of medication and special accommodations for learning disabled students; yet these responses fail to address the social and nonmedical causes of children’s classroom inattention or agitation, such as increasing class size or the termination of physical education programs (Conrad 1975).
In each case, and many others, the process by which human problems become medicalized in the first place is largely ignored in creating policy toward these issues. A social constructionist approach provides a means of understanding how such problems come to be defined in medical terms and how this translates into public policy (see Gusfield 1981). As the above examples attest, medicalized constructions can also be strongly evaluative (i.e., they suggest how people ought to behave) and result in policies that authorize social control." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Conrad, P. |author2=Kristen, K.. |year=2010 |title=The social construction of illness, key insights and policy implications |journal=Journal of health and social behaviour |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=S67-S69 |url=http://hsb.sagepub.com/content/51/1_suppl/S67.full.pdf+html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031100543/http://hsb.sagepub.com/content/51/1_suppl/S67.full.pdf+html |archivedate=31 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They conclude that in an information age . new social groupings emerging may challenge the social constructions of illness and force policy changes.

Foucault examines power systems that incur on the operation of institutions and professionals:

“The first task of the doctor is ... political: the struggle against disease must begin with a war against bad government." Man will be totally and definitively cured only if he is first liberated...” &lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M., 1973, The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception, Tavistock publications limited, available at http://monoskop.org/images/9/92/Foucault_Michel_The_Birth_of_the_Clinic_1976.pdf [accessed 14 November 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK parliament in a key issues statement for 2015 references a 1957 statement by the royal commission but queries its impact some 60 years later:

“Most people are coming to regard mental illness and disability in much the same way as physical illness and disability”
(Report of the Royal Commission on the law relating to mental illness and mental deficiency, 1957)

"Anti-stigma campaigns and the growing profile of mental health issues in recent years appear to have gone some way to changing views and dispelling misconceptions about mental illness. But with nine in ten people with mental health problems still experiencing stigma and discrimination, nearly sixty years after the Royal Commission’s optimistic assessment, there may still be some way to go in changing public attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=UK Parliament |year=2015 |title=Tackling social stigma on mental health: Key issues for the 2015 Parliament |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-parliament-2015/social-change/mental-health-stigma/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain oppressions in the UK were removed by the [[Mental Health (Discrimination) Act 2013]]

===The self and identity===
Research directions here are on the importance of experiential narrative within psychiatric dialogue. Some research is critical of modern psychiatric adoption of an 'empiricist-behavioural approach' within the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]. Nelson, Yung, Bechdolf and McGorry examine this in context of a phenomonological approach to the understanding of ultra high risk psychiatric disorders. They criticize psychiatric research that addresses subjectivity:

"When attempts have been made to address subjectivity, the psychiatric researcher is left without the requisite conceptual tools. Instead, this form of research has tended to live out Abraham Maslow’s statement ‘‘If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to treat everything as if it were a nail.’’ That is, the subjective has been approached in operational terms..."
&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Yung, Bechdolf, McGorry.,2008, [http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/34/2/381.pdf "The Phenomenological Critique and Self-disturbance: Implications for Ultra-High Risk ‘Prodrome’ Research"], Schizophrenia Bulletin ,34(2) pp381-392&lt;/ref&gt;

'Mad Studies' is an emerging field of study wherein the user movement seeks to reclaim words such as mad and loony and redefine how psychiatry envisages the concept of madness, refuting where user experiences have been co-opted into psychiatric definitions . Mad Studies provides a construct whereby people with 'negative' mental health seek to be identified as part of the neuro-diversity of the human race. 
“We write at a time when activist concepts such as recovery, inclusion, access and hope have been co-opted, appropriated and politically neutralised by policy-makers, service-providers and government (Costa 2009; McWade 2014; Morgan 2013). User-led services and organisations continue to be most severely affected by spending cuts (Morris 2011), whilst anti-stigma campaigns endorsed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists continue to be pumped with millions of pounds to sell a sanitised version of ‘mental health’ to the masses (Armstrong 2014). Personalisation has been implemented through a free market ideology that has seen the dispossession and even some deaths of disabled people. It is ‘time to talk’, and not in the way the establishment wants us to, with individualised and neatly packaged tales of recovery. Instead, let us build upon the rich histories of activism and bring our shared experiences of oppression and marginalisation together” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mcwade |author2=Milton |author3=Beresford |year=2015 |title=Mad studies and neurodiversity: a dialogue |journal=Disability &amp; Society|volume=30 | issue = 2 |pages=71–87 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2014.1000512 |doi=10.1080/09687599.2014.1000512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple way of looking at it is a slogan adopted by self-advocates 'nothing about us, without us', encouraging educators to co-teach with people who have lived experience of mental illness or distress.
A key concept in this ontolology is the idea of san[e]ism – a sixth structural oppression to go alongside those associated with race, gender, disability, age and class. It is also defined as [[Mentalism (discrimination)]] :
“From where we stand, san[e]ism is a devestating [sic?] form of oppression, often leading to negative stereotyping, discrimination, or arguments that Mad individuals are not fit for professional practice or, indeed, for life (Poole et al., 2012). According to Kalinowski and Risser (2005), sane[e]ism also allows for a binary that separates people into a power-up group and a power-down group. The power-up group is assumed to be normal, healthy and capable. The power-down group is assumed to be sick, disabled, unreliable, and, possibly violent. This factional splitting ensures a lower standard of service for the power-down group and allows the power-up group to judge, reframe and belittle the power-down group in pathological terms”.&lt;ref&gt;LeFrançois, B., Menzies, R. 2013, "Mad Matters: A Critical Reader in Canadian Mad Studies, “Breaking open the bone", pp 96-97, Canadian Scholars press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement to reconstruct schizophrenia==
{{Main|Hearing Voices Movement}}

''Alternative Perception'' is one of several names suggested by the [[schizophrenic]] user movement to replace the term [[schizophrenia]] which is on a [[spectrum]] of psychotic disorders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ahmed, Iqbal |author2=Fujii, Daryl |title=The spectrum of psychotic disorders: neurobiology, etiology, and pathogenesis |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-521-85056-8}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered to be outmoded by many consumers of services. Several academic authorities, notably Professor [[Marius Romme]] founder and principal theorist for the Hearing Voices Movement provide a rationale for the abandonment of this label. A symposium of some of the leading notions in this field from consumers of services and academics concluded:{{Quote|We are calling for the label of schizophrenia to be abolished as a concept because it is unscientific, stigmatising, and does not address the root causes of serious mental distress. The CASL campaign is driven by two central factors. The concept of schizophrenia is unscientific and has outlived any usefulness it may once have claimed. The label schizophrenia is extremely damaging to those to whom it is applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caslcampaign.com/|title=caslcampaign.com|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical construction of schizophrenia==
{{Further|History of schizophrenia}}

The terms ''[[schizophrenia]]'' and ''[[autism]]'' originated from the works of [[Eugen Bleuler]] (1857–1939) as different aspects of the same diagnostic condition. Bleuler was a contemporary of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]]. Prior to Bleuler's interventions schizophrenia was referred to as [[dementia praecox]] (early insanity) and perceived as a single disorder. Schizophrenia is sometimes also referred to as [[hebephrenia]], stemming in etymology from the Greek god [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] who was associated with adolescence and as it was thought the onset of schizophrenia came at adolescence. It is generally acknowledged that schizophrenia can have early onset and late onset.

"He first advanced the term schizophrenia in 1908 in a paper based on a study of 647 Burghölzli patients. He then expanded on his paper of 1908 in Dementia Praecox oder Gruppe der Schizophrenie…Bleuler is credited with the introduction of two concepts fundamental to the analysis of schizophrenia: autism, denoting the loss of contact with reality, frequently through indulgence in bizarre fantasy; and ambivalence, denoting the coexistence of mutually exclusive contradictions within the psyche." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69329/Eugen-Bleuler|title=Eugen Bleuler - Swiss psychiatrist|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schizophrenia in America is a medical diagnostic category, which in the 1970s was primarily termed differentiated and undifferentiated schizophrenia; international leaders such as R.D. Laing in Europe offered professional expertise in serving this population group. In the context of community mental health services, the broad term mental health also referred to individuals who may have this diagnosis, which may or may not be considered to be valid or relevant. The word schizophrenia is often associated with a "major mental breakdown" in common parlance which may result in the need for psychotherapy, mental health counseling, person-centered therapy,&lt;ref&gt;Moon, K.A., Witty, M., Grant, B., &amp; Rice, B.

==Charities committed to changing public perception==
Charities that disagree with the notion of the schizophrenia label in the U.K. include [[Mind (charity)]] and [[Rethink Mental Illness|Rethink]]. Mind state on their website "Because of differences of opinion about schizophrenia, it's not easy to identify what might cause it." Mind have previously published an explanatory leaflet, prefaced by [[Michael Palin]] that gives a definition of schizophrenia as people 'who think outside the normal range of human experience'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind.org.uk/help/diagnoses_and_conditions/schizophrenia/|title=Schizophrenia - Mind, the mental health charity - help for mental health problems|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Alliance on Mental Illness says:

"By changing the name, consumers with the symptoms of what actually may be a [[spectrum]] of disorders would have a more accurate and descriptive name attached to their diagnosis. Ideally, they would also experience less stigma, as they left behind a name with Greek origins that roughly translates to “shattered mind” and which is often used in popular culture to mean "multiple personality disorder" or "split personality.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=Schizophrenia&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=40298|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061117071330/http://www.nami.org/TextTemplate.cfm?Section%3DSchizophrenia%26template%3D/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm%26ContentID%3D40298|dead-url=yes|title=NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness - NAMI: The National Alliance on Mental Illness|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science of schizophrenia and comorbid conditions==
{{Main|Causes of schizophrenia}}
Whilst the definitive cause(s) of schizophrenia remain unknown, research has indicated strong links between genetic make-up, social predisposing factors or stressors and environmental conditions in relation to the development and onset of schizophrenia and other conditions. International geneticists are working towards identifying a gene for Schizophrenia, combined efforts are at the [[SzGene]] database. In the course of this research geneticists have identified specific [[genes]] or [[copy number variants]] or [[alleles]] that may explain the [[comorbidity]] of various conditions.

===Genetic links between comorbid conditions===
[[File:Chromosome 16.svg|thumb|alt=Chromosome 16 |Ideogram of human chromosome 16]]
Links between [[autism]] and [[schizophrenia]] have been studied. From clinical observation, both conditions cause a disruption in normative social functioning which may be mild or severe depending on the individual's position within the spectrum. Social cognition is under-developed in autism and highly developed in psychoses. Four genetic loci are diametrically opposed in terms of diagnoses of autism and schizophrenia, with corresponding deletions for one condition or duplications for the other. Researchers examining [[chromosome 16]] (16p11.2) identified a heredity area on the short arm of human chromosome 16 (16p11.2) which contains microduplication and microdeletion of genome variation. Microduplication of hereditary factors in this heredity area increased the individual's risk of schizophrenia more than 8–14-fold and of autism over 20-fold. A corresponding microdeletion instead of microduplication in the area affected the risk of autism only, but not of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Crespi | first1 = B. | last2 = Badcock | first2 = C. | title = Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–261; discussion 261–320 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X08004214 | pmid=18578904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news178822577.html "Research backs theory on autism, schizophrenia": accessed 9 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=McCarthy SE, Makarov V, Kirov G, etal |title=Microduplications of 16p11.2 are associated with schizophrenia |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=41 |issue=11 |pages=1223–7 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19855392|pmc=2951180 |doi=10.1038/ng.474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kumar RA, KaraMohamed S, Sudi J, etal |title=Recurrent 16p11.2 microdeletions in autism |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=628–38 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18156158 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddm376}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study of ''de novo'' mutations, ''ie'' new mutations in people with both autism and schizophrenia spectrum conditions, concluded that schizophrenia and autism are due to "errors" during early [[organogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Awadalla | first1 = P. | last2 = Gauthier | first2 = J. | last3 = Myers | first3 = R.

The National Institute of Mental Health reported on 8 December 2009 that in spring 2010, major databases on autism research would be joined up to facilitate further research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2009/major-databases-link-up-to-advance-autism-research.shtml Major Databases Link Up to Advance Autism Research. Accessed 12 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic allelles===
Other genetic analysis examines the role of alleles. One study ascribes links between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by studying a total group of 6909 Europeans, both diagnosed and undiagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Purcell SM, Wray NR, Stone JL |title=Common polygenic variation contributes to risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder |journal=Nature |volume=460 |issue=7256 |pages=748–52 |year=2009 |pmid=19571811 |doi=10.1038/nature08185|display-authors=etal|pmc=3912837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study suggests that Genetic markers may be very dissimilar among different lineages of DNA in people of different cultures, making an international commonality in genetics as a precipitating factor in schizophrenia difficult to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McClellan JM, Susser E, King MC |title=Schizophrenia: a common disease caused by multiple rare alleles |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=190 |issue= |pages=194–9 |date=2007 |pmid=17329737 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.025585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

===Social factors===
A study published in ''The Guardian'', reported on 9 December 2009, ascribes the onset of the condition to social factors. The authors of the study, which compared 500 patients with mental health problems with other ethnic groups and a control group of 350 people, claim there is an epidemic of schizophrenia amongst the Afro-Caribbean community . They refute the argument that racism may contribute to more diagnoses from psychiatrists of schizophrenia amongst members of the Afro Caribbean community and ascribe more value to deprivation and social isolation as triggering factors in those with a propensity towards schizotype personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/dec/09/african-caribbean-schizophrenia-policy|title=Schizophrenia 'epidemic' among African Caribbeans spurs prevention policy change|first=Matthew|last=Lewin|date=8 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical and environmental factors===

Various studies have indicated chemical precipitating factors in the development of autism or schizophrenia and also suggested that environmental factors such as toxins in the air may have precipitated a rise in the number of children born with autism. Ploeger discovered that pre-natal prescribed softenon in the 1960s and '70s led to an increase of children born with autism by 4% as opposed to a usual figure of 0.1%. Sodium valproate, a drug used as an anti-epileptic and as a mood stabilizer, increased the chance of children being born with autism sevenfold. The active component of cannabis (THC) is thought by some to increase the chances of onset of schizophrenia by 2.6 times in its skunk preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-12/aaon-edm112508.php|title=Epilepsy drug may increase risk of autism in children|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-12/nofs-aas121708.php|title=Autism and schizophrenia share common origin|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-01/uoc--ssc010709.php|title=Study shows California's autism increase not due to better counting, diagnosis|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/dec/01/skunk-users-psychosis-risk-research|title=Skunk users face greater risk of psychosis, researchers warn|first1=Sarah|last1=Boseley|first2=health|last2=editor|date=30 November 2009|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/nov/03/david-nutt-drugs-policy|title=David Nutt: my views on drugs classification|first=David|last=Nutt|date=2 November 2009|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time{{When|date=September 2016}} there is no publicly available research on commonalities between these chemicals that may trigger the on/off switches in neuro-receptors linked to genes responsible for conditions on the autistic or schizophrenic spectrum.

===Criticism of genetics===

Critique in terms of current genetic research is that there are many candidates for [[copy number variants]] that may predispose a likelihood of developing schizophrenia but current research is flawed by both the sample sizes available for analysis by condition population and by an incomplete understanding of 'double whammies' where one [[allele]] affects another.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schizophreniaforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=1575 "CNV 'Double Whammies' May Account for Variable Neuropsychiatric Phenotypes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129221028/http://schizophreniaforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=1575 |date=29 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been referred to as genetic 'dark matter' with the notion that many rare mutations have not yet been discovered.

===Evolution===

Links between [[autism]] and [[schizophrenia]] have been studied (as above). The implications are both conditions are part of the same spectrum. From clinical observation, both conditions cause a disruption in normative social functioning which may be mild or severe depending on the individual's position within the spectrum. Simon Fraser University researcher Crespi has examined how social cognition is under developed in autism and highly developed in Psychoses and outlines how the relationship between autism and schizophrenic spectrum is not one that has been explored in detail in the latter part of the 20th century. His research hypothesises that the genetic marker for both conditions may lie in the same location. His team have identified four loci that are diametrically opposed in terms of diagnoses of autism and schizophrenia with corresponding deletions for one condition or duplications for the other:
{{Quote|text="Crespi says the work supports the hypothesis that risks of autism and schizophrenia “have evolved in conjunction with the evolution and elaboration of the human social brain.”"|sign=|source=}}

Professor Timothy Crow, from the University Department of Psychiatry at Oxford University, has long argued that schizophrenia as a condition came about as a result of [[natural selection]]. He has argued that schizophrenia is a by-product of the development of language, resulting from an evolutionary change approximately 150,000 years ago, that persisted due to sexual selection. However, conversely to study in [[polygene]]s or multiple allele combinations, he maintains that the answer lies in:
{{Quote|text="the evolutionary history of the Protocadherin11XY gene pair that characterizes the hominin lineage including the 'sapiens' event that represents the transition to modern Homo sapiens."|sign=|source=}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/researchintelligence/issue14/language.html Clues to the origin of language?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925151039/http://www.liv.ac.uk/researchintelligence/issue14/language.html |date=25 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120225162511/http://www.schizophreniaforum.org/pap/readmore.asp?commentID%3D%7BA01C1B66%2D4388%2D4904%2D82E6%2D7DA9B552814A%7D Schizophrenia Research Forum Comment on Published Paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immunology and schizophrenia===
A strand of research into schizophrenia is to investigate the links between viruses that attack the immune system such as herpes and the onset of schizophrenia. Researchers in this field are hopeful that this connection may provide a cure for schizophrenia within the next 20 years.
{{Quote|text="On the basis of the findings, perspectives for future research are outlined aiming at a precise and consequent strategy to elucidate a potential involvement of immune mechanisms in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia."|sign=|source=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rothermund, M. |author2=Volker, A. |author3=Bayer, T. | title=Review of Immunological and Immunopathological Findings in Schizophrenia|journal=Brain, Behaviour and immunity |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=319–339 |year=2001 |pmid= |doi=10.1006/brbi.2001.0648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller proposes that the vulnerability-stress model of analysis of schizophrenia should become the vulnerability-stress-inflammation model:
{{Quote|text="The vulnerability-stress-inflammation model is important as stress may increase proinflammatory cytokines and even contribute to a lasting proinflammatory state. The immune system itself is considered an important further piece in the puzzle, as in autoimmune disorders in general, which are always linked to three factors: genes, the environment and the immune system. Alterations of dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission have been shown with low-level neuroinflammation and may directly be involved in the generation of schizophrenic symptoms"|sign=|source=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Muller, N.|title=Immunology of Schizophrenia|journal=Neuroimmunomodulation|volume=21 |pages=109–116 |date=2014|doi=10.1159/000356538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that viral infections of the immune system can dramatically increase the frequency of the onset of schizophrenia.

“ a large scale Danish nationwide study on 39,076 persons with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders showed that the history of hospitalisation with infection increased the risk of schizophrenia by 60%” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norbert Muller |author2=Aye-Mu Myint |author3=Markus J.

==Global moves to change the construction of 'schizophrenia' ==

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands alternative proposals for the name ''schizophrenia'' include ''dysfunctional perception syndrome'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://astridvanwoerkom.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/schizophrenia-now-called-dysfunctional-perception-syndrome/|title=Schizophrenia Now Called "Dysfunctional Perception Syndrome"|author=|date=9 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Salience Syndrome :

"The concept of 'salience' has the potential to make the public recognize psychosis as relating to an aspect of human mentation and experience that is universal. It is proposed to introduce, analogous to the functional-descriptive term 'Metabolic syndrome', the diagnosis of 'Salience syndrome' to replace all current diagnostic categories of psychotic disorders. Within Salience syndrome, three subcategories may be identified, based on scientific evidence of relatively valid and specific contrasts, named Salience syndrome with affective expression, Salience syndrome with developmental expression and Salience syndrome not otherwise specified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Os J |title='Salience syndrome' replaces 'schizophrenia' in DSM-V and ICD-11: psychiatry's evidence-based entry into the 21st century? |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=363–72 |date=2009 |pmid=19807717 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01456.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[social model of disability]] perspective, this interlinks:

{{Quote|The human mind has the ability to turn its attention to something that is salient, something that jumps out at you. We then focus on it. In some people this function is disturbed, and everything gets an enormous significance. They think, for example, that a television programme is about them, or that people who are just walking along the street are out to harm them. Research shows that this can happen to everybody under the influence of drugs, also to healthy people. The word syndrome indicates that it is about a cluster of symptoms. And not about a clearly defined illness.&lt;ref&gt;Mol., S., 2009, ‘Dysfunctional Perception Syndrome’: The new name for schizophrenia? {{cite web |url=http://www.intervoiceonline.org/assets/2010/2/5/Dysfunctional_Perception_Syndrome.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830051101/http://www.intervoiceonline.org/assets/2010/2/5/Dysfunctional_Perception_Syndrome.pdf |archivedate=30 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Japan===
In Japan "In order to contribute to reduce the stigma related to schizophrenia and to improve clinical practice in the management of the disorder, the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology changed in 2002 the old term for the disorder, ''Seishin Bunretsu Byo'' ("mind-split-disease"), into the new term of ''Togo Shitcho Sho'' ("integration disorder")…Eighty-six percent of psychiatrists in the Miyagi prefecture found the new term more suitable to inform patients of the diagnosis as well as to explain the modern concept of the disorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sato M |title=Renaming schizophrenia: a Japanese perspective |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=53–55 |year=2006|pmid=16757998 |pmc=1472254}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Japanese society of psychiatry and neurology report:
"This change is making psychoeducation much easier and is being useful to reduce misunderstandings about the illness and to decrease the stigma related to schizophrenia. The new term has been officially accepted by the Japanese medicine and media and is being adopted in the legislation in 2005."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1414727 |title=The Yokohama Declaration: an update | pages=60–61 | volume=4 |issue=1 |journal=World Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In South Korea, schizophrenia has been renamed to 'Attunement Disorder'

"a new term, “Johyeonbyung (attunement disorder)”, was coined in South Korea. This term literally refers to tuning a string instrument, and metaphorically it describes schizophrenia as a disorder caused by mistuning of the brain's neural network." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee, Y.S. |author2=et al. |title=Johyeonbyung (attunement disorder): Renaming mind splitting disorder as a way to reduce stigma of patients with schizophrenia in Korea |journal=Asian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=8 |pages=118–120 |year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.ajp.2014.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Captive''''' ({{lang-fr|'''La Prisonnière'''}}) is a 1926 play by [[Édouard Bourdet]]. The three-act melodrama was among the first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays to deal with [[lesbianism]] and caused a scandal in New York City. The play was shut down after 160 performances and prompted the adoption of a state law dealing with obscenity.

==Synopsis==
Irène is a lesbian tortured by her love for Madame d'Aiguines, but pretending engagement to Jacques. Though Irène attempts to leave Mme. d'Aiguines and marry Jacques, she returns to the relationship, saying that it is "a prison to which I must return captive, despite myself". Mme. d'Aiguines is not seen in the play, but leaves behind [[nosegay]]s of [[Viola (plant)|violets]] for Irène, as a symbol of her love.&lt;ref name="Noble"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noble|first1=Jean Bobby|title=Masculinities without Men?: Female Masculinity in Twentieth-Century Fictions|date=2004|publisher=[[University of British Columbia Press|UBC Press]]|page=xx|isbn=0-7748-0996-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fKXRhX-SZEUC&amp;lpg=PR20&amp;ots=3TzsHIJEBG&amp;dq=d'Aiguines%20violets&amp;pg=PR20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character Irène is depicted as a lesbian who is feminine, attractive, and seductive. Sherrie Inness writes that "the play dismantles the idea of the lesbian as the easily recognizable [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] (i.e., the mannish lesbian)," instead offering a lesbian prototype more threatening to the hegemony of heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inness|first1=Sherrie A.|title=Who's Afraid of Stephen Gordon?: The Lesbian in the United States Popular Imagination of the 1920s|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Autumn 1992|volume=4|issue=3|pages=303–320|jstor=4316217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age difference between Irène and Madame d'Aiguines was a type of relationship often portrayed in mid-20th century depictions of lesbians and reinforced [[Teresa de Lauretis]]'s conjecture that the loss of the mother produces relationships of that type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sinfield|first1=Alan|title=Lesbian and Gay Taxonomies|journal=Critical Inquiry|date=Autumn 2002|volume=29|issue=1|page=134|doi=10.1086/368000|jstor=10.1086/368000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York County District Attorney [[Joab H. Banton]] received pressure from the Society for the Prevention of Vice. When mayor [[Jimmy Walker]] went on vacation to Cuba in February 1927, acting mayor [[Joseph V. McKee|Joseph "Holy Joe" McKee]] ordered Banton to "banish nudity and obscenity" from Broadway theatres.&lt;ref name="Porter"/&gt; Plainclothes police were ordered to monitor ''The Captive'' and [[Mae West]]'s play ''[[Sex (play)|SEX]]'' on 5 February. Four days later, Banton issued an order to have the casts of both plays arrested.&lt;ref name="Porter"/&gt;

On 9 February, while Rathbone and Menken were in middle of the second act of ''The Captive'', police marched onto the stage and arrested the pair. With the rest of the cast, they were thrown in the back of a police van with the cast of ''SEX'', who had also been arrested and taken to jail. West and Menken fought with each other, with West accusing Menken of being a lesbian in a [[lavender marriage]] and Menken suggesting that West was a [[drag queen]].&lt;ref name="Porter"/&gt; Rathbone described the events on the night of the raid in his autobiography: "As we walked out onto the stage to await our first entrances we were stopped by a plainclothes policeman who showed his badge and said, 'Please don't let it disturb your performance tonight but consider yourself under arrest!' ... At the close of the play the cast were all ordered to dress and stand by to be escorted in police cars to a night court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rathbone|first1=Basil|title=In and Out of Character|date=1989|publisher=Limelight Editions|location=New York|isbn=978-0-87910-119-0|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nL7GCsYhiHwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=In%20and%20Out%20of%20Character&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorneys for ''The Captive'' secured the release of the cast by agreeing with the office of the District Attorney to withdraw their play from the stage.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Production director [[Gilbert Miller]] asked the [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous Players-Lasky Motion Picture Company]] to support a legal challenge to the closure, but they wouldn't for fear of negative publicity.&lt;ref name="Sova"/&gt; Following the suppression of the play, publisher [[Horace Liveright]] bought the production rights. He went to court seeking an injunction against the New York Police Department to prevent the play from being closed again. Though Liveright gave up after months of negotiations with the authorities, Acting Mayor McKee retaliated by re-opening a two-year-old indictment.&lt;ref name="Sova"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dardis|first1=Tom|title=Firebrand at Work|journal=The Antioch Review|date=1995|volume=53|issue=3|page=355|doi=10.2307/4613179|jstor=4613179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wales Padlock Act====
In New York, a censorship campaign against the plays ''The Captive'', ''The Virgin Man'', ''[[The Drag (play)|The Drag]]'' (another Mae West production marketed as "A Male ''Captive''"&lt;ref name="Symonds"/&gt;), and ''SEX'' prompted the Wales Padlock Act, a state law that had the effect of banning depictions of homosexuality in theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bronski|first=Michael|title=Culture Clash: The Making of Gay Sensibility|year=1984|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-89608-217-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBOARyvN-cMC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22the+captive%22+1926+play&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z5r0UPiqKpLiqAGyi4HQDw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20captive%22%201926%20play&amp;f=false|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsored by New York State Senator [[B. Roger Wales]], the bill allowed for the arrest and prosecution of any actors or producers involved in an "immoral drama." If the producers of a play were convicted, the theatre could be [[padlock]]ed for a year. The legislature amended the public obscenity code to ban plays "depicting or dealing with the subject of sex degeneracy, or sex perversion."&lt;ref name="Sova"/&gt;

====Effect on the demand for violets====
In the 1920s, "violet" was a common slang word for homosexuality, often associated with lesbians.&lt;ref name="Symonds"/&gt; Lesbian audience members for ''La Prisonnière'' in Paris pinned violets to their lapels and belts to show solidarity with the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beredjiklian|first1=Norma|title=The Violets Of Dutchess County|journal=The Violet Gazette|date=Autumn 2000|volume=1-4|page=3|url=http://americanvioletsociety.org/HistoryTraditions/Duchess_County.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper coverage of ''The Captive'' further publicized the notion of the violet as a homosexual symbol, an association that lasted several decades.&lt;ref name="Symonds"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Symonds|first1=Dominic|title=We'll Have Manhattan: The Early Work of Rodgers &amp; Hart|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-992949-8|page=213|edition=Rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QRwMBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;ots=zWAOlLS2C8&amp;dq=captive%20bourdet%20empire%20theatre&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association did not bode well for violet sales. Flower shops in New York City saw a decreased demand for violets.&lt;ref name="Noble"/&gt; A November 1934 article in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', "The Story of Violets", related that "way back in the violet county last year they were still cursing this play as the knell of the violet industry."&lt;ref name="Sova"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1718">[[A. Barton Hepburn]] was directed by the [[New York State Legislature]] in 1879 to investigate the railroads' practice of giving rebates within the state. Merchants without ties to the oil industry had pressed for the hearings. Prior to the committee's investigation, few knew of the size of [[Standard Oil]]'s control and influence on seemingly unaffiliated oil refineries and pipelines - Hawke (1980) cites that only a dozen or so within Standard Oil knew the extent of company operations. The committee counsel, [[Simon Sterne]],  questioned representatives from the [[Erie Railroad]] and the [[New York Central Railroad]] and discovered that at least half of their long-haul traffic granted rebates, and that much of this traffic came from Standard Oil. The committee then shifted focus to Standard Oil's operations. [[John Dustin Archbold]], as president of Acme Oil Company, denied that Acme was associated with Standard Oil. He then admitted to being a director of Standard Oil. The committee's final report scolded the railroads for their rebate policies and cited Standard Oil as an example. This scolding was largely moot to Standard Oil's interests since long-distance oil pipelines were now their preferred method of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawke|first=David Freeman|title=John D.

'''''The Jewel of Seven Stars''''' is a [[Horror fiction|horror]] novel by Irish writer [[Bram Stoker]], first published by Heinemann in 1903. The story is a first-person narrative of a young man pulled into an [[Archaeology|archaeologist's]] plot to revive Queen Tera, an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[mummy]]. It explores common ''[[fin de siècle]]'' themes such as [[imperialism]], the rise of the [[New Woman]] and [[feminism]], and societal progress.

Prepublication issues toward a US edition were deposited for copyright by [[Doubleday, Page &amp; Company]] in December 1902 and January 1903 but the first US edition was published by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] in 1904.&lt;ref name=LCC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lccn.loc.gov/82466184 "The Jewel of Seven Stars" (92pp, 1902)]; [https://lccn.loc.gov/82466185 "The Jewel of Seven Stars" (162, 280pp, 1903)].

Malcolm Ross, a young [[barrister]], is awakened in the middle of the night and summoned to the house of famous [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] Abel Trelawny at the request of his daughter, Margaret, with whom Malcolm is enamored. Once Malcolm arrives at the house, he meets Margaret, Superintendent Dolan, and Doctor Winchester, and learns why he has been called: Margaret, hearing strange noises from her father's bedroom, woke to find him unconscious and bloodied on the floor of his room, under some sort of trance. Margaret reveals that her father had left a letter of strange instructions in the event of his incapacitation, stating that his body should not be removed from his room and must be watched at all times until he wakes up. The room is filled with Egyptian relics, and Malcolm notices that the "mummy smell" has an effect on those in the room. A large mummy cat in the room disturbs Margaret's cat, Silvio, and the doctor suspects Silvio is guilty of the scratch marks on Trelawny's arm.

On the first night of watch, Malcolm awakens to find Trelawny again on the floor, bloody and senseless. Margaret asks Dr. Winchester to summon another expert, and he calls for Dr. James Frere, a brain specialist. However, when Frere demands that Trelawny be moved from his room, Margaret refuses and sends him away. After a normal night with no attacks, a stranger arrives, begging to see Trelawny. He reveals himself to be Eugene Corbeck, an Egyptologist who was working with Trelawny. He has returned from Egypt with lamps that Trelawny requested, but finds upon his arrival at the house that the lamps have disappeared. The next day, Malcolm and Margaret admire Trelawny's Egyptian treasures, noting in particular a large [[sarcophagus]], a [[Chest (furniture)|coffer]] covered with hieroglyphics, and an oddly well-preserved mummy hand with seven fingers. Malcolm then finds the missing lamps in Margaret's bedroom. Concerned for Margaret, Malcolm tells Corbeck everything that has happened up until his arrival, and Corbeck gives Malcolm a mysterious book to read. The book tells the story of Nicholas van Huyn, a Dutch explorer who travelled to the Valley of the Sorcerer to explore the tomb of a mysterious Egyptian queen, Tera. In the tomb, he finds a sarcophagus and a mummy hand with seven fingers, adorned with a ruby ring with seven points that look like stars.

Corbeck tells Malcolm that, years ago, he and Trelawny travelled to Egypt to search for the tomb where the sarcophagus lies. They find the tomb and discover that the mummy's wrist was coated with fresh dried blood. The [[hieroglyphics]] on the wall led Corbeck and Trelawny to believe that the mummy was possessed with some sort of black magic and that Queen Tera had immense power over the Upper and Lower Worlds. The hieroglyphics seemed to indicate that Tera planned to return from the dead. They took the sarcophagus from the tomb and left, only to be robbed of the mummy during a storm by their Arab guides. Trelawny suggested that they return to the tomb, where they found the mummy and the three Arabs, murdered. During their time in the tomb, they were put under some trance and recovered three days later to find that Trelawny's wife had died in childbirth, but Margaret survived. Sixteen years passed before Trelawny contacted Corbeck, frantic because he believed that the lamps they saw in the tomb, when arranged in a specific shape, would make the coffer open and would possibly be the key to Tera's resurrection.

Corbeck's story is interrupted by Trelawny's revival. He embraces his daughter and joyfully approves Malcolm's courtship. Dolan and the police depart, glad to escape from the mystery, and Trelawny gathers the remaining inhabitants of the house to explain his Great Experiment. He describes how powerful Queen Tera was and explains that her spirit has been residing in the mummy cat in Trelawny's room, waiting to be reunited with its human form. Trelawny believes that the coffer, when opened by the proper formation of the lamps, will release some sort of magic that will revive the mummy and bring Tera's spirit to life. Trelawny's attack was the attempt of Tera's [[astral body]]—the mummy cat—to remove the Jewel of Seven Stars from a locked safe in his bedroom. He reveals that he has prepared a house in isolated Kyllion where the experiment is to take place.

After this overwhelming wealth of information is revealed, Malcolm questions the implications of ancient forces interacting with new civilization. He worries about the impact on religion and monotheism if the power of the ancient Egyptian gods is proven. Trelawny also posits that the ancient Egyptians possessed contemporary scientific knowledge, such as the discovery of [[radium]] and invention of electricity. Once everyone arrives at the new house, Margaret's behavior becomes increasingly erratic, and she seems to have an uncanny knowledge of Tera's thoughts and feelings. Malcolm begins to suspect that Margaret is the astral body of Tera and fears that she will be too weak to fight off a possession, but when he relays these concerns to Trelawny and Margaret, they seem unafraid of this possibility.

On the night of the experiment, a wild storm rages outside as they set up in a cave underneath the house. Margaret tells her father that Tera will not possess the mummy cat and will remain powerless until the experiment is complete, seeming to confirm that Margaret has been possessed. Somehow comforted by the confirmation of Tera's existence, they proceed with the experiment and unwrap the mummy. They discover that Tera is wearing a marriage robe, which greatly distresses Margaret. Malcolm is put in charge of turning on the electric lights after the experiment ends, and Margaret blows out the candles. As the lamps are lit, the coffer begins to glow, emitting a green vapour that passes into the sarcophagus. Suddenly, the wind from the storm shatters a window, blowing the vapour around the room, and black smoke pours out of the coffer. The room is engulfed in smoke, and Malcolm waits for the command to turn on the lights, but it never comes. The lamps slowly burn out and Malcolm fumbles in the dark, coming across the limp body of a woman whom he believes is Margaret. He carries her upstairs and leaves her in the hall while he runs for matches, but when he returns, he finds only Tera's bridal robe lying on the floor, the Jewel of Seven Stars lying where the heart would be. He returns to the cave and turns on the lights to find all of his companions on the floor, dead.

In a revised version released in 1912, this ending was removed. In the second version, the experiment fails entirely, no one is harmed, and Margaret and Malcolm marry a few years later.

=== Characters ===
* '''Malcolm Ross''': The protagonist and narrator, Malcolm is drawn into the mystery of Queen Tera by his love for Margaret Trelawny, and his desire to protect her guides most of his actions. 
* '''Margaret Trelawney''': The daughter of Abel, born while Abel was entranced in Tera's tomb, Margaret begins as a demure and sweet woman but grows more independent throughout the text. She strongly resembles Queen Tera and eventually takes on similar characteristics, possibly being possessed by Tera's spirit.
* '''Abel Trelawny''': A famous Egyptologist who becomes obsessed with the idea of resurrecting Tera. A hopeful, ambitious, and fearless man, he is extremely interested in scientific progress and believes that the ancient Egyptians were more progressive than the contemporary British. 
* '''Eugene Corbeck''': An Egyptologist who aids Trelawny in his endeavors to recover Egyptian artifacts. A little bit feisty, he seems more interested in the artifacts than the idea of resurrecting Tera. His enthusiasm wanes and his anxiety grows as the Great Experiment goes from theory to reality. 
* '''Doctor Winchester''': A young doctor who initially comes to treat Trelawny for his wounds but becomes entangled in the mystery. Though he is hesitant at first to give up on factual evidence, he shows a willingness to believe in the supernatural and eagerly assists in the revival.

== Historical background ==
=== Egyptomania ===
In 1882, the British government began its efforts to [[colonization|colonize]] Egypt, declaring it a [[protectorate]].&lt;ref&gt;Egypt. In Britannica Online Encyclopedia. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Victorian-era fascination with Egypt had risen at the start of the nineteenth century, when European exploration of Egypt began. Archaeological discoveries of ancient Egyptian tombs and monuments such as Cleopatra's Needle and the [[Rosetta Stone]] sparked the interest of European scholars and travelers.&lt;ref&gt;Brier, B. (2013). Egyptomania: Our three thousand year obsession with the Land of the Pharaohs. Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonization of Egypt made it easier to bring these monuments back to Britain, and "there soon arose a demand for antiquities from Egypt to be shipped to private manors in Europe as well as to public museums. It became popular for mummies to take up residence in the libraries and studies of rich Europeans and for houses to be decorated with Egyptian motifs and artifacts".&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, J. D. (2002). Beyond Orientalism: Nineteenth century Egyptomania and Frederick Arthur Bridgman’s 'The Funeral of a Mummy'. University of Louisville.&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptology and the fascination with ancient artifacts were echoed in nineteenth-century literature. Between 1860 and 1914, hundreds of stories about Egyptian mummies, curses, and exploration were published. Roger Luckhurst situates this within a cultural trend of what he calls Egyptian Gothic, "a set of beliefs or knowledges in a loosely occult framework" developed in response to British anxieties about the rule of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Luckhurst, R. (2012). The mummy’s curse: The true history of a dark fantasy. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One common plot in these narratives was the "Mummy’s Curse", which "follows the basic plot structure of misappropriation of tomb artifacts with fatal consequences following the protagonist home and features the explicit warning 'beware of the Mummy’s Curse'”;&lt;ref&gt;Bulfin, A. (2011). The fiction of Gothic Egypt and British Imperial paranoia: The curse of the Suez Canal. English Literature in Transition, 1880-1920, (54) 4, 411-443.&lt;/ref&gt; often these artifacts were possessed by some supernatural element. Mummies were often the focal point of these stories, usually of noble rank, because most of the mummies being discovered in the nineteenth century were pharaohs. There was an emphasis on the idea of perfect preservation and beauty; mummies were unraveled at museum exhibitions in British museums, and audiences were amazed by their "almost perfect condition".&lt;ref&gt;Fleischhack, M. (2009). Vampires and Mummies in Victorian Gothic Fiction. 	Inklings: Jahrbuch für Literatur und Ästhetik, 27, 62-77. Retrieved from https://www.academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their preserved beauty, female mummies in Victorian fiction were often eroticized objects of desire.&lt;ref&gt;Deane, B. (2008).

=== Queen Hatshepsut ===
[[File:Hatshepsut-CollosalGraniteSphinx02 MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|The [[sphinx]] of Hatshepsut at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]

Though Queen Tera is an entirely fictional character, she bears many resemblances to [[Queen Hatshepsut]], a [[pharaoh]] in Ancient Egypt. Hatshepsut ruled Egypt from 1479 BC to 1458 BC, one of the first and few female rulers. She married her half-brother, Tuthmose II, who ruled from 1492 BC until his death in 1479 BC. At this point, Hatshepsut became [[regent]] to Tuthmose's son, by a concubine, her half-nephew. Rather than being regent to the toddler king, however, Hatshepsut took the throne and declared herself ruler. However, because Egyptian kingship was intrinsically masculine, Hatshepsut publicly transformed her feminine self; all statues and "images of her after her coronation show her as a man—wide shoulders, trim hips, and no hint of breasts".&lt;ref&gt;Cooney, K. The woman who would be king. ''Lapham’s Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt; About twenty years after her death in 1458 BC, her name and image was removed from temple walls, and many of her statues were destroyed. Dorman argues that this was not personal animosity, but rather an attempt to eradicate any hints of an unconventional, female ruler, "best erased to prevent the possibility of another powerful female ever inserting herself into the long line of Egyptian male kings".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Wilson, E. B. (2006, September). The queen who would be king. ''Smithsonian Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tomb of Queen Hatshepsut was discovered by [[Howard Carter]] early in 1903, the same year as the publication of ''The Jewel of Seven Stars'', in the [[Valley of the Kings]]—similar to the Valley of the Sorcerer, where Tera is found in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Highfield, R. (2007, Jun. 2007). How I found Queen Hatshepsut. ''The Telegraph''.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities between the two, Hebblethwaite states, are "almost too overt to be mere coincidence";&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Hebblethwaite, K. (2008). "Introduction". ''The jewel of seven stars''. New York, NY: Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; both are extremely powerful female rulers who take on the role of men. Just as Hatshepsut commanded and transfigured her masculine image, it is found in Tera's tomb that "[p]rominence was given to the fact that she, though a Queen, claimed all the privileges of kingship and masculinity. In one place she was pictured in man’s dress, and wearing the White and Red Crowns. In the following picture she was in female dress, but still wearing the Crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, while the discarded male raiment lay at her feet".&lt;ref&gt;	''The jewel of seven stars'', p.129&lt;/ref&gt; Both Tera and Hatshepsut also seemed to possess some awareness that their legacy would be destroyed. In the novel, Tera leaves an inscription stating her plans for resurrection, as well as that "the hatred of the priests was, she knew, stored up for her, and that they would after her death try to suppress her name".&lt;ref&gt;''The jewel of seven stars'', p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; A similar inscription was found on an [[obelisk]] at Hatshepsut's memorial: "Now my heart turns this way and that, as I think what the people will say—those who shall see my monuments in years to come, and who shall speak of what I have done".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;

== Literary background ==
=== Bram Stoker ===
[[File:Bram Stoker 1906.jpg|thumb|left|Bram Stoker in 1906.]]
Stoker's own knowledge of Egyptology can be seen in his painstaking attention to historical accuracy in ''The Jewel of Seven Stars''. The Egyptian artifacts are described in laborious detail, contemporary Egyptologists such as [[Flinders Petrie]] and [[Wallis Budge]] are referenced, and "the many mentions of ancient Egyptian gods, funerary practices and traditional customs that pepper the novel testify to the author’s profound knowledge of his subject".&lt;ref&gt;Hebblethwaite, p.xxi&lt;/ref&gt; Stoker studied at [[Trinity College Dublin]], which boasted a notable program in [[Orientalism]], where many early Orientalists and Egyptologists studied.&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, J. (2008). ''Irish Orientalism: A literary and intellectual history''. New York: Syracuse University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to several biographies of Stoker, he was close with Sir [[William Wilde]]—the father of [[Oscar Wilde|Oscar]]—who was an Egyptology enthusiast, and often shared the stories of his adventures with Stoker. On one voyage in 1837, Wilde discovered a mummy outside of a tomb near [[Saqqara]] and brought it back to Dublin; Belford argues that this would later inspire Stoker to write a mummy story.&lt;ref&gt;Belford, B. (2002). ''Bram Stoker and the man who was Dracula''. Da Capo Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Stoker references his friendship with another Orientalist explorer, [[Sir Richard Francis Burton]], in his ''Personal Reminiscences of Henry Irving''. Burton, an explorer of the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]], wrote and published many accounts of his travels, and Stoker admired his adventures and discoveries: "Burton had the most vivid way of putting things—especially of the East. He had both a fine imaginative power and a memory richly stored not only from study but from personal experience….Burton knew the East. Its brilliant dawns and sunsets…the mysteries of its veiled women; its romances; its beauty; its horrors".&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, B. (1906). ''Personal reminiscences of Henry Irving''. London: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the stories of Egypt he heard, Stoker dedicated himself to the study of Egyptology; Stoker was known to own a number of texts on Egyptology, including William Wilde's ''Narratives of a Voyage to Madeira'', Wallis Budge's ''Easy Lessons in Egyptian Hieroglyphics'', ''Egyptian Religion: Egyptian Ideas on the Future Life'', and Flinders Petrie's ''Egyptian Tales Translated from the Papyri''.&lt;ref&gt;Hebblethwaite, p.xix&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genre ==
=== Imperial Gothic ===
''The Jewel of Seven Stars'', from its placement during the fin-de-siecle, is an example of Imperial Gothic. Influenced by anxiety over the decline of the [[British Empire]], Imperial Gothic texts employ elements of [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] literature, such as darkness, death, sexuality, and the [[occult]], and combine them with concerns about imperialism, [[colonialism]], and nineteenth-century politics. Brantlinger notes three key themes of Imperial Gothic: "individual regression or going native; an invasion of civilization by the forces of barbarism or demonism; and the diminution of opportunities for adventure and heroism in the modern world".&lt;ref&gt;Brantlinger, P. (1988). ''Rule of darkness: British literature and imperialism, 1830-1914''. Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial Gothic is marked by a fear of the future, expressing these anxieties as supernatural events that are equally uncontrollable. ''The Jewel of Seven Stars'' represents a specific fear, which Brantlinger labels the "invasion scare story": in a reversal of the "outward thrust of imperialist adventure", a foreign body gains power and threatens the existing structure of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Brantlinger, P. (1985, Jan. 1). Imperial gothic: Atavism and the occult in the British adventure novel, 1880-1914. ''English Literature in Transition, 1880-1920, (28)'' 3, 243-252.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Jewel of Seven Stars'', Queen Tera's resurrection is the embodiment of this threat:

"It was all so stupendous, so mysterious, so unnecessary! The issues were so vast; the danger so strange, so unknown. Even if it should be successful, what new difficulties would it not raise…there would be some strange and awful development—something unexpected and unpredictable—before the end should be allowed to come…!”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The jewel of seven stars'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

The confirmation of Tera's existence and her potential ability to return and invade Western civilization, shattering pre-existing beliefs about religion and science, reflects the anxieties brought on by the end of imperialism. This echoes the uncertainty of the future as the era of imperialism came to an end, and the idea of reverse colonialism became more prominent and terrifying.

=== Gothic horror ===
''The Jewel of Seven Stars'' is part of a subgenre of Gothic fiction known as [[Gothic horror]]. First featured in [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''The Castle of Otranto'', Gothic horror combines elements of the Gothic and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] genres to create a pleasurably terrifying experience.&lt;ref&gt;The Gothic. (n.d.) In ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Norton Topics Online''. Retrieved from http://www.wwnorton.com&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', and Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]'' are all considered landmarks of Gothic horror fiction. Though it increased in popularity in the nineteenth century, elements of Gothic horror have appeared in more contemporary works, influencing authors from [[Edgar Allan Poe]] to [[Stephen King]]. The genre is marked by supernatural occurrences, gloomy settings, violent emotions, terror, and threatening villains, all of which appear in ''The Jewel of Seven Stars''. The villains are themselves supernatural in some way; the abundance of mummy fiction in late [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] literature is closely linked to this genre.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischhack, M. (2009). Vampires and Mummies in Victorian Gothic Fiction. Inklings: ''Jahrbuch für Literatur und Ästhetik'', 27, 62-77. Retrieved from https://www.academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
Stoker's writing style is often overlooked, as he is seen as more of a [[genre]] writer due to his mastery of the horror novel than a literary author. Most of his writings are still unknown; in an interview with Stoker's grandnephew, this is attributed to the fact that "Stoker never had time to perfect his style in the numerous novels and stories he wrote…most of the rest of his product remains unreadable and inept. Some of it, in fact, is so bad that it has been mistaken for burlesque".&lt;ref&gt;Muro, M. (1983, Apr. 1). Dusting off Dracula’s creator: A blood relative of Bram Stoker seeks recognition for the long-neglected Gothic novelist. ''Boston Globe''.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, scholars of Stoker's forgotten works contest this, arguing that Stoker was much more than a genre author writing for "chills and thrills". In a review of a collection of Stoker's lesser-known writing, critic Colin Fleming explains, "there’s no easy category to dump [Stoker] in, and the one he’s in—Scary Writer Guy—is limiting".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Fleming, C. (2013). Digging up the truth about Bram Stoker. ''The Virginia Quarterly Review, (89)'' 3, 207-212. Retrieved from	http://lion.chadwyck.com&lt;/ref&gt; Fleming classifies Stoker's style as Gothic as well as [[Modernist]], pointing out Modernistic elements such as [[non-linear narrative]] and referring to his works as "collage art": a combination of voices from a variety of sources that make up a single text.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; This idea of collage is represented in the journalistic interludes and alternating voices in ''The Jewel of Seven Stars''; at two points, the story breaks away from Malcolm's narration and takes on the voice of first Nicholas Van Huyn, through a retelling of his novel, and then Corbeck's extensive story about finding Tera's tomb.

[[File:Lyceum Theatre 2.jpg|thumb|The Lyceum Theatre, where Stoker worked and was inspired to write melodramatic fiction.]]

Stoker's style was arguably a product of his background in the theatre, working as business manager to theatre legend [[Henry Irving]] and running the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] for twenty-seven years. Wynne posits that Stoker's [[melodrama]]tic tendencies were directly influenced by his knowledge of [[Victorian theatre]], "with all its theatrics and high emotions".&lt;ref&gt;Merritt, S. M. (2013, Jul. 11). Bram Stoker, Dracula, and the Victorian Gothic stage (Book review). ''Diabolique Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; The mysticism of the occult and the supernatural that Stoker expounds upon in ''The Jewel of Seven Stars'', Wynne argues, was inspired by the stage "magic" and innovations in staging that allowed for illusions to be performed in the theatre: "Stoker in his fiction…[uses] illusion in the service of the supernatural".&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, C. (2013). ''Bram Stoker, Dracula, and the Victorian Gothic stage''. Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being influenced by his relationship with Irving and the theatre, Stoker's style was also influenced by his friendship with poet [[Walt Whitman]]. According to Perry, Stoker admired the poet and often emulated his style in personal letters to Whitman, an emulation that would later appear in Stoker's novels. Stoker's lengthy, eloquent descriptions possess a poetic quality, and Perry argues that his characters "[speak] with a sense of rhythm, parallelism, and balance that is characteristic of Whitman".&lt;ref&gt;Perry, D. R. (1986). Whitman’s Influence on Stoker’s Dracula. ''Walt Whitman Quarterly Review, (3)'' 3, 29-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==
=== Old versus New ===
A major concern in ''The Jewel of Seven Stars'' is the tension between the Old World and the New in terms of progress. The late nineteenth century was a time of invention and modernization, and the novel constantly questions the power of the past in comparison to these modern technological and scientific innovations. Senf argues that "Stoker was aware of the scientific and cultural developments that were taking place around the turn of the century, that he was fascinated with technological developments…Stoker sometimes saw the future as full of infinite possibilities for improvement, [and] sometimes as totally at the mercy of primitive forces".&lt;ref&gt;Senf, C. A. (2002). ''Science and social science in Bram Stoker’s fiction''. Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; This is demonstrated in the appropriately titled chapter, "Powers—Old and New", in which Malcolm considers the consequences of Tera's resurrection on existing British beliefs. The direction of his thoughts in this chapter, which was notably deleted from the 1912 edition, seems to indicate that ancient Egyptian society was more progressive than nineteenth-century England, both spiritually and scientifically:

"The whole possibility of the Great Experiment to which we were now pledged was based on the reality of the existence of the Old Forces which seemed to be coming in contact with the New Civilisation…If there were truth at all in the belief of Ancient Egypt then their Gods had real existence, real power, real force…If then the Old Gods held their forces, wherein was the supremacy of the new?”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Malcolm realizes in this passage that the success of Tera's resurrection will shake the fundamental Christian belief of [[monotheism]] by proving that the religious principles of the Egyptians held merit and truth. Cowed by this perjurious thought, Malcolm reflexively cuts himself off, thinking, "I dared not follow it!”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, the question of progression is immediately brought up again in Trelawny's equally unnerving theories on science. In particular, Trelawny posits that the Egyptians had discovered electricity and [[radioactivity]] long before nineteenth-century scientists. As Hebblethwaite explains, radioactivity had been recently discovered by [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and [[Marie Curie]] at the time of ''The Jewel of Seven Stars''’ publication, and "electric light was just beginning to be widely used in domestic households…throughout Stoker’s novel, there runs an underlying sense of wonder at modern man’s ability to harness the power of electricity".&lt;ref&gt;Hebblethwaite, p.xxix&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the fact that these scientific advancements were so recent, the idea that ancient Egyptians had been using this science centuries before is even more staggering.

Especially given that ''The Jewel of Seven Stars'' was published right at the turn of the twentieth century, Stoker's implications of the power of the past call for a respect for "primitive" nineteenth-century discoveries. Hebblethwaite articulately states: "As a new century began, and Victorian became Edwardian, [the novel] counsels its readers not to utterly reject the past as archaic and non-essential—there were things of value to be learned and remembered".&lt;ref&gt;Hebblethwaite, xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The New Woman ===
At the time of ''The Jewel of Seven Stars''{{'}} writing, the empowerment and assertiveness of women was on the rise. The ''fin de siècle'' was marked by the emergence of the "[[New Woman]]", middle-class feminists who espoused the domestic sphere and sought social and sexual freedom, challenging the gender roles that dominated British society. Jusova explains that by "[contesting] and defamiliarizing the hegemonic Victorian definitions of gender and sexual identities, the New Woman further fueled the anxieties and fears that already circulated among the middle-class British population at the time".&lt;ref&gt;Jusova, I. (2005). ''The new woman and the empire''. Columbus, OH: The Ohio State University Press. Retrieved from http://ohiostatepress.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kvinde-emancipation.gif|thumb|A political cartoon from the 1890s depicting the New Woman.]]

Stoker's other works, most notably ''Dracula'', are heavily critical of the New Woman, rebuking the characters' progressive sexuality, as in the case of the female [[vampires]] in ''Dracula'': "the female vampires in ''Dracula'' are [Stoker's] way of responding to the growing equality of men and women, in particular their sexual equality. Not only does he emphasize their voluptuousness and sexual aggression and contrast their behavior to that of his chaste and sexually timid heroine but he has his male characters destroy these threatening women and reestablish a more traditional order".&lt;ref&gt;Senf, C. A. (2007). Rethinking the new woman in Stoker’s fiction: Looking at 'Lady Athlyne'. ''Journal of Dracula Studies, (7)'', 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; As the New Woman became more prevalent in society, however, Stoker continued to feature independent female characters in his works, balancing an exploration of the possibility of feminine power with a [[patriarchal]] discourse: "[Stoker’s heroines] frequently display both a degree of personal assertion and a sexual precocity which at first sight distances them from the patriarchal ideal of female passivity and subservience…even though by the end of each work the suggestion is implicitly made that biological difference, the destiny invested in gender, is the most powerful force of all".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, W. (2000). ''Beyond Dracula: Bram Stoker’s Fiction and its Cultural Context''. New York: St. Martin’s Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This contradiction can be seen in ''The Jewel of Seven Stars'' through Margaret's transformation; though she gains strength throughout the novel, in the end she does not survive to see a society where New Women reign. Margaret begins as a timid, submissive daughter and non-threatening love interest, but she gradually takes on the qualities of Queen Tera, becoming strong and self-sufficient. As Margaret's feminine qualities strengthen, her male counterparts are increasingly threatened. Malcolm is continually disturbed and "quite unmanned" by Margaret's empowerment and, as Hebblethwaite points out, "finds her newfound womanly emotionalism—'gloom and anxiety, hope, high spirits, deep depression, and apathetic aloofness'—not conducive to his own peace of mind".&lt;ref&gt;Hebblethwaite, p.xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The more Margaret embraces her freedom, the more distant she is to Malcolm, even occasionally showing outright disdain; this exemplifies what males fear will happen if women gain autonomy.

[[File:Gaston Maspero demaillotage.jpeg|thumb|left|An illustration of European men unwrapping a mummy, 1886.]]

When the men in the narrative attempt to regain masculine control, they are subverted by Margaret. As Deane argues, the wrapped and veiled Victorian mummy is extremely sexualized, "a woman…who, perfectly preserved in her youthful beauty, strongly attracts the libidinous attention of modern British men".&lt;ref&gt;Deane, B. (2008). Mummy fiction and the occupation of Egypt: Imperial striptease. ''English Literature in Transition, 1880-1920, (51)'' 4, 381-410. Retrieved from http://muse.jhu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; In the final scene, the group of men publicly and voyeuristically unravel Tera's corpse, which, Hebblethwaite states, is a way to humiliate the female and revert her to submission.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Tera's naked, youthful body is described in great detail as the men, even Malcolm, become "more and more excited".&lt;ref&gt;''The jewel of seven stars'', p.233&lt;/ref&gt; However, this attempt at reassertion is interrupted by Margaret, who demands Tera be covered and removes the body from the men's invasive gazes. Ultimately, the men are returned to the role of observer and must await Margaret's consent to continue, implying the uncontrollable nature of the New Woman.

The ending of the novel presents an ambiguous answer to the issue of the New Woman, one that is noticeably altered in the 1912 edition. In the 1903 version, Margaret dies, putting an end to her independence. However, it is implied by the presence of Tera's burial robe in her place that Tera lives and escapes from her male captors, suggesting a more positive outcome for the New Woman. In stark contrast, the 1912 edition drastically revises the ending: Tera dies instead and Margaret and Malcolm are married. According to Andrew Smith, "The first ending suggests Stoker’s inability properly to control the rebellious aspects of the Female Gothic, whereas the second, as in Dracula, implies the possibility of exerting social control through marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. (2004, May). Love, Freud, and the Female Gothic: Bram Stoker’s ''The Jewel of Seven Stars. Gothic Studies, (6)''1, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Much like ''Dracula'', which received very little critical attention until the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. (Ed.). (2009). ''Critical insights: Dracula''. Salem Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Jewel of Seven Stars'' had a very underwhelming response from nineteenth-century critics. When the novel was released in 1903, critics and readers were generally left confused by the story; one review stated that readers would "curdle their blood" and "addle their brains" trying to understand "this most extraordinary story".&lt;ref&gt;(1903). Some novels of the season. ''The Review of Reviews, (28)'', p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt; A London newspaper, ''[[Saturday Review (London)|The Saturday Review]]'', was even less positive: "This book is not one to be read in a cemetery at midnight…but it does not quite thrill the reader as does the best work in this genre…It is due to Mr. Stoker to say that his wild romance is not ridiculous even if it fails to impress".&lt;ref&gt;(1903, Dec. 19). "The Jewel of Seven Stars". ''Saturday review of politics, literature, science, and art''. p. 768.&lt;/ref&gt; In Stoker's body of work, the endings are all relatively satisfying, clear-cut, and optimistic. The ambiguous, tragic ending of ''The Jewel of Seven Stars'' left readers baffled. In the 1960s and 1970s, when critical studies of ''Dracula'' increased, more of Stoker's lesser-known work came to light, including ''The Jewel of Seven Stars''. The novel has been examined by critics, but is seen more as a collective part of Stoker's work than an exemplary novel that stands on its own, as ''Dracula'' does.

=== 1912 edition ===
When the novel was re-released in 1912, the speculative chapter 16, "Powers Old &amp; New", had been removed. The ending was rewritten as an upbeat, straightforward conclusion wherein Tera is defeated, everyone lives, and Margaret and Malcolm get married. Though Harry Ludlam's biography of Stoker states that the publishers asked for a happier and less gruesome ending, Stoker never confirmed this reason.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlam, H. (1977). ''A biography of Bram Stoker: Creator of Dracula''. New 	English Library.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Ludlam's explanation does not account for the removal of Chapter 16. Stoker's own perspective on censorship in a 1908 essay indicates that he would not have consented to censorship by a publisher: "[T]he strongest controlling force of imagination is in the individual with whom it originates. No one has power to stop the workings of imagination…individual discretion is the first line of defence against such evils as may come from imagination".&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, B. (1908, September). The censorship of fiction. ''The nineteenth century and after: A monthly review.''&lt;/ref&gt; From this statement promoting self-censorship, William Hughes constructed an argument that Stoker himself chose to revise the ending and remove Chapter 16 because it incited religious doubt and speculation that would threaten dominant religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, W. (1994). Profane resurrections: Bram Stoker’s self-censorship in ''The Jewel of Seven Stars''. In A. L. Smith &amp; V. Sage (Eds.), ''Gothick Origins and Innovations'' (132-140). Rodopi.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tribe of Witches: The Religion of the Dobunni and Hwicce''''' is a historical and archaeological study of pre-Christian religion among the Iron Age ''[[Dobunni]]'' and the Early Medieval ''[[Hwicce]]'', two tribal groups who lived in [[central England]]. It was written by the archaeologist Stephen J. Yeates and published by Oxbow Books in 2008. Yeates had previously published his theories in a three-volume British Archaeological Report monograph entitled ''Religion, Community and Territory: Defining Religion in the Severn Valley and Adjacent Hills from the Iron Age to the Early Medieval Period'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yea06|Yeates 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the book, Yeates explores a number of different archaeological and geographical features located in the region of ''Dobunni'' and ''Hwicce'', looking at how the landscape evolved throughout the Iron Age, Romano-British period and [[England in the Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]]. These include the temples built in the area, sacred rivers, mines and defensive features.

''The Tribe of Witches'' was reviewed in both peer-reviewed academic journals and by a number of practicing [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagans]]. The former were predominantly negative, arguing that Yeates' arguments were farfetched, lacking sufficient evidence and that he suffered from a poor grasp of [[onomastics]]; in contrast, many also praised his writing style and his extensive use of references and images. Yeates expanded on the theories put forward in ''The Tribe of Witches'' in his later book, ''A Dreaming for the Witches: The Recreation of the Dobunni Primal Myth'' (2009).

==Background==
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
The book was the result of research carried out by Yeates at [[Oxford University]] as part of a D.Phil. project from 2001–05. The supervisors of the study were Prof. [[Martin Henig]] and Prof. [[Barry Cunliffe]], and the assessors Dr. Ray Howell and Prof. Chris Gosden. Though certain ideas, such as that concerning Cuda, had already been formulated before this period.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Several of Yeates' arguments and theories had seen publication prior to the release of ''The Tribe of Witches''. His theories regarding the goddess Cuda had been published in peer assessed academic journals both locally,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yea04|Yeates 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yea07|Yeates 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the 2006 publication ''Religion, Community, and Territory'' from a linguist Baker stated that we should now recognise Cuda and that she is the root of place-names using *Cod.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bak08|Baker 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Cotswold river-names have been discussed in an article in the ''Journal of the English Place-name Society''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yea06b|Yeates 2006]]. pp. 63&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments for cultural continuity in the region were also published in a peer assessed paper in Lewis and Semple (2010) ''Perspectives in Landscape Archaeology: Papers presented at Oxford 2003–05''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yea10|Yeates 2010]]. pp. 78&amp;ndash;93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
Chapter one, "The ''Dobunni'', the ''Hwicce'' and Religion", offers an introduction to Yeates' argument, noting that his study is multidisciplinary in nature, making use of history, archaeology and onomastics. Offering a brief background to both the ''Dobunni'' and the ''Hwicce'', Yeates then briefly discusses the manner in which scholars have previously approached the study of pre-Christian religion in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yea08|Yeates 2008]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; The second chapter, entitled "The Deity and the Landscape", looks at the various shrines and temples from both the Pre-Roman and Roman Iron Age that have been archaeologically identified within the ''Dobunni'' region. Using etymological evidence, he puts forward propositions for the existence of previously unknown prehistoric deities who were localised to the region, namely an Iron Age goddess of the [[Cotswolds]] known as Cuda. Yeates attempts to present a picture of the regional landscape, and the manner in which it was viewed as being "spiritual and imbued with the divine" by its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yea08|Yeates 2008]]. pp. 9&amp;ndash;29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter three, "The Sacred Rivers", explores the deification of rivers in the British Iron Age, and the archaeological evidence for votive offerings within them. Yeates proceeds to look at the multiple rivers within the region being discussed &amp;ndash; including the [[River Severn]] and [[River Wye]] &amp;ndash; while making reference to any evidence for ritual activity along them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yea08|Yeates 2008]]. pp. 30&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth chapter, "The Gods of Tribes and Folk Groups", considers the long-term developments of communities in the area, and the connections that might exist between Iron Age and Early Medieval settlements. Proclaiming that Medieval sources record the existence of two local Iron Age gods, Weogonera and Salenses, he uses this as evidence for his belief that there was a cultural continuity from prehistory into the Medieval, and that the ''Hwicce'' were therefore the descendents of the ''Dobunni''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yea08|Yeates 2008]]. pp. 59&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter five, "Mining and Minerals", explores evidence for mining in the region, highlighting the connection between this activity and religious belief in prehistoric society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yea08|Yeates 2008]]. pp. 90&amp;ndash;101.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter six deals with aspects of war.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Chapter seven deals with the local hunter god and sacred groves or nemetons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yea08|Yeates 2008]]. pp. 107&amp;ndash;116.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments concerning the hunter god in local "Dobunnic" religion are not new and have their origins in a series of publications by Boon,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boo89|Boon 1989]]. pp. 201&amp;ndash;217.&lt;/ref&gt; Henig&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hen96|Henig 1996]]. pp. 97&amp;ndash;103.&lt;/ref&gt; and Merrifield.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer96|Merrifield 1996]]. pp. 105&amp;ndash;113.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter eight looks at tree shrines. Chapter nine the significance of burial in the landscape. Chapter ten considers the sacred horse. Chapter eleven looks at the tribal deities. Chapter twelve the influence of Christianity.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

|quote     = "Yeates brings into this discussion a variety of evidence, including material from archaeology, epigraphy, onomastics, imagery, folk tradition, religion, landscape studies and history of the Roman and early medieval periods. His principal foci are religion and landscape, and it is through intensive investigation of these two topics that he addresses the question of continuity from the earlier group to the later. As he explains, the beliefs and practices of the pre-Christian religions of Britain are difficult to ascertain but, in pulling together diverse kinds of evidence, the author attempts to draw connections between religious ideas in the late prehistoric Iron Age, the Roman Period and the early Middle Ages."

Peter S. Wells of the [[University of Missouri]] reviewed ''The Tribe of Witches'' for the ''[[Cambridge Archaeological Journal]]'' in 2009. Wells criticised Yeates' use of the word "tribe" to refer to both the ''Dobunni'' and the ''Hwicce'', believing that another term may have been more appropriate. He also criticised the use of maps, believing that they were unhelpful, in particular for anyone not familiar with the regional landscape. Considering the text to be "very engaging", he noted that the bibliography was "extensive and valuable", with good use of illustrations. Nonetheless, Wells thought Yeates' primary argument to be unconvincing, highlighting the fact that depictions of females holding vessels were widespread across the Roman world, and not localised to the region of the ''Dobunni''.&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;[[#Well09|Wells 2009]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time and Mind|Time and Mind: The Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture]]'' published a review authored by the folklorist Jeremy Harte. Taking a largely negative attitude towards ''The Tribe of Witches'', he proclaimed that the work greatly resembled the sort of approach that he would have expected from a 19th-century antiquarian. Although applauding Yeates' extensive use of referencing, he stated that many of Yeates' basic arguments were wrong and that several of Yeates' statements were misleading. Noting that "whole chapters are little more than a repetition of possibilities", he condemned much of the book's argument by remarking that much of Yeates' sacred landscape consists of "nonexistent sites" that were "created by analogy with other sites which are not there either." Ultimately, he accepted that although a "colorful book", ''The Tribe of Witches'' resembled "historical romance" more than historical scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Har11|Harte 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another largely negative review, this time written by the Celticist Simon Rodway of the [[University of Aberystwyth]], appeared within ''[[Britannia (journal)|Britannia: A Journal of Romano-British and Kindred Studies]]''. Admitting that from the back cover he expected ''The Tribe of Witches'' to be filled with "wild claims", he was surprised that these claims were "merely hinted at" most of the time; he found it difficult to describe the book as "an ambitious work" due to the fact that while a broad swathe of material is dealt with, most of it is examined only perfunctorily, leaving Rodway with the impression that Yeates "has lost interest in his subject entirely." Stating that Yeates' hypothesis was hidden within a "pseudo-Nennian heap", he chastises the author for failing to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims for an Iron Age/Medieval cultural continuity, and for failing to propose how such a continuity had been maintained; he highlights that Yeates' argument here is similar to Nicholas Higham's "problematic" theory of a largely peaceful language shift from Celtic to Germanic. Although remarking that he was unfit to judge Yeates' use of the archaeological material, he did note that the author's use of historical sources was "adequate at best" while his use of onomastics was "woeful"; remarking that Yeates clearly belonging to "the 'sounds a bit like' school of etymology", he states that Yeates has also failed to understand the arguments of many of the onomasticians whom he is citing and that "[a]ny novice historical linguist" could have told the author that his "tribe of witches" was a "phantom". Furthermore, highlighting that "very few pages are free of basic errors", he describes Yeates' thinking as "muddled" and ultimately considered ''The Tribe of Witches'' to be a "shallow, muddled and thoroughly underwhelming book" of no use to the scholarly study of either the ''Dobunni'' or ''Hwicce''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rod09|Rodway 2009]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other peer-reviewed journals to publish reviews included ''Oxoniensia'' and ''Transactions of the Birmingham &amp; Warwickshire Archaeological Society''.

In a short review published in ''British Archaeology'', the magazine of the [[Council for British Archaeology]], the landscape archaeologist Della Hooke of the [[University of Birmingham]] criticised Yeates' book, labeling it a "bold attempt" but opining that it lacked sufficient evidence for many of its conclusions. Arguing that his arguments were "intriguing but unproven", Hooke felt that it was "unwise" to publish Yeates' conclusions in a "popular concise form" where they would reach a larger non-academic audience. She furthermore attacked his theory that the ''Hwicce'' took their name from an Iron Age witch stirring a sacred cauldron, claiming that it "verges upon fantasy."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hoo09|Hooke 2009]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider reception===
Writing on The Druid Grove website, a reviewer going by the pseudonym of Kestrel referred to Yeates' work as "a most interesting book" but expressed reservations about his theories regarding the mother goddess with her tub being symbolic of the valley.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kes|Kestrel (undated)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[Paganism (contemporary)|Contemporary Pagan]], D. James, reviewed the book on the ''Twisted Tree Bookshelf'' website. James believed that the book should be read by contemporary Pagans, and that it "significantly increases our understanding of the social and religious structures of our ancient forebears and is worthy addition to any bookshelf."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jam08|James 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Steven Posch writes that since witchcraft did not become a religion until the 20th century, any attempts to derive it from a tribal religion of more than 1000 years previous are ultimately tendentious, and suggests that Yeates worked backwards from modern Wicca, "doing his damnedest to find a Triple Goddess paired with a God of Hunting—and better it be if he’s horned." Posch holds that the book is of importance to modern pagans as mythic, rather than historic, history, and that Yeates' vision of a paganism grounded in the local landscape offers a template for contemporary pagan praxis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pos|Posch 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;
