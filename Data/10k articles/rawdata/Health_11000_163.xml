'''''ABC Africa''''' is a [[2001 in film|2001]] [[cinema of Iran|Iranian]] documentary feature film directed by [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. It was screened out of competition at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1100000/year/2001.html |title=Festival de Cannes: ABC Africa |accessdate=2009-10-24|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invited by the [[United Nations]] to study the endeavors of the Uganda Women’s Effort to Save Orphans, [[Abbas Kiarostami|Kiarostami]] and his collaborator Seifollah Samadian initially went to the country to scout locations for a feature length film. However, when the pair returned home and examined the more than twenty hours of digital footage shot on [[digital video]] with a handheld video camera over the course of ten days, they decided their material was worth editing into the feature length film. For Kiarostami, this film was a return to his early themes of resilient children in the face of adversity,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ica.art/whats-on/abbas-kiarostami-focus-abc-africa&lt;/ref&gt;, but for the first time it was outside his homeland with a more versatile format. Nevertheless, [[Iran]]’s foremost film-maker has succeeded in locating reasons for optimism among the nearly two million orphans left helpless by the ravages of civil war and [[AIDS]].

==Plot==
Set in a refugee camp in Kampala, Uganda, Kiarostami intersperses scenes of women and children dancing, singing, and laughing with somber images of the death rampant from numerous diseases. Sometimes critiqued as touristic, there are several scenes of the children laughing, making faces at the camera, and being astounded as they watch their friends be recorded.&lt;ref&gt;http://sensesofcinema.com/2013/feature-articles/the-appearance-of-appearance-absolute-truth-in-abbas-kiarostamis-abc-africa/&lt;/ref&gt; Although this film is likely not the somber reflection on AIDS and civil war originally envisioned by the United Nations, it is a documentary of Kiarostami and Samadian's trip to Uganda, and the earnest reactions of the impacted women and children.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/may/12/artsfeatures.cannes2001&lt;/ref&gt; The candid and often silly scenes of the children contrast sharply with quiet images of death that speak to both the true tragedies occurring as well as the everyday joys that allow the women and children to continue.

'''Allostasis''' is the process of achieving stability, or [[homeostasis]], through physiological or behavioral change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Copstead|first1=Lee-Ellen|last2=Banasik|first2=Jacquelyn|title=Pathophysiology|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=St Louis, Missouri|isbn=978-1-4557-2650-9|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be carried out by means of alteration in [[Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis|HPA axis]] hormones, the [[autonomic nervous system]], [[cytokine]]s, or a number of other systems, and is generally adaptive in the short term &lt;!--name="ReferenceA"--&gt;{{harv|McEwen &amp; Wingfield|2003}}.  Allostasis is essential in order to maintain internal viability amid changing conditions ({{harvnb|Sterling|Eyer|1988}}; {{harvnb|McEwen|1998a}}; {{harvnb|McEwen|1998b}}; {{harvnb|Schulkin|2003}}).

Allostasis provides compensation for various problems, such as in compensated [[heart failure]], compensated [[kidney failure]], and compensated [[liver failure]]. However, such allostatic states are inherently fragile, and [[decompensation]] can occur quickly, as in [[acute decompensated heart failure]].

==Nature of concept==

The concept of allostasis was proposed by Sterling and Eyer in 1988 to describe an additional process of reestablishing homeostasis, but one that responds to a challenge instead of to subtle ebb and flow. This theory suggests that both homeostasis and allostasis are endogenous systems responsible for maintaining the internal stability of an organism. Homeostasis, from the Greek homeo, means "similar," while stasis means "stand;" thus, "standing at about the same level." (The term was not coined as "homostasis" or "standing the same" because internal states are frequently being disturbed and corrected, thus rarely perfectly constant.) Allostasis was coined similarly, from the Greek allo, which means "variable;" thus, "remaining stable by being variable" ({{harvnb|Sterling|Eyer|1988}}; {{harvnb|Klein|2004}}).  Allostatic regulation reflects, at least partly, cephalic involvement in primary regulatory events, in that it is anticipatory to systemic physiological regulation ({{harvnb|Sterling|Eyer|1988}}; {{harvnb|Schulkin|2003}}). The term [[Heterostasis(Computational)|Heterostasis]]&lt;ref&gt;Selye, H. (1973) Homeostasis and Heterostasis. Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 16, 441-445&lt;/ref&gt; is also used in place of Allostasis, particularly where state changes are finite in number and therefore discrete (e.g. computational processes). 
Wingfield states:&lt;blockquote&gt;The concept of allostasis, maintaining stability through change, is a fundamental process through which organisms actively adjust to both predictable and unpredictable events... Allostatic load refers to the cumulative cost to the body of allostasis, with allostatic overload... being a state in which serious [[pathophysiology]] can occur... Using the balance between energy input and expenditure as the basis for applying the concept of allostasis, two types of allostatic overload have been proposed {{harv|Wingfield|2003}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sterling (2004)&lt;!--how to template this? --&gt; proposes six interrelated principles that underlie allostasis:
# Organisms are designed to be efficient
# Efficiency requires reciprocal trade-offs
# Efficiency also requires being able to predict future needs
# Such prediction requires each sensor to adapt to the expected range of input
# Prediction also demands that each effector adapt its output to the expected range of demand
# Predictive regulation depends on behavior whilst neural mechanisms also adapt.

==Contrast with homeostasis==
The difference between allostasis and homeostasis is popularized by [[Robert Sapolsky]]'s book [[Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers]]:

:Homeostasis is the regulation of the body to a balance, by single point tuning such as blood oxygen level, blood glucose or blood pH. For example, if a person walking in the desert is hot, the body will sweat and they will quickly become dehydrated. Allostasis is adaptation but in regard to a more dynamic balance. In dehydration, sweat occurs as only a small part of the process with many other systems also adapting their functioning, both to reduce water use and to support the variety of other systems that are changing to aid this. In this case, kidneys may reduce urine output, mucous membrane in the mouth, nose and eyes may dry out; urine and sweat output will decrease; the release of [[arginine vasopressin]] (AVP) will increase; and veins and arteries will constrict to maintain blood pressure with a smaller blood volume.

==Types==
McEwen and Wingfield propose two types of allostatic load which result in different responses:-

&lt;blockquote&gt;Type 1 allostatic overload occurs when energy demand exceeds supply, resulting in activation of the emergency life history stage. This serves to direct the animal away from normal life history stages into a survival mode that decreases allostatic load and regains positive energy balance. The normal life cycle can be resumed when the perturbation passes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Type 2 allostatic overload begins when there is sufficient or even excess energy consumption accompanied by social conflict and other types of social dysfunction. The latter is the case in human society and certain situations affecting animals in captivity. In all cases, secretion of glucocorticosteroids and activity of other mediators of allostasis such as the autonomic nervous system, CNS [[neurotransmitters]], and inflammatory cytokines wax and wane with allostatic load. If allostatic load is chronically high, then pathologies develop. Type 2 allostatic overload does not trigger an escape response, and can only be counteracted through learning and changes in the social structure ({{harvnb|McEwen|Wingfield|2003}}; {{harvnb|Sterling|Eyer|1988}})&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereas both types of allostasis are associated with increased release of [[cortisol]] and [[catecholamines]], they differentially affect [[thyroid homeostasis]]: Concentrations of the [[thyroid hormone]] [[triiodothyronine]] are decreased in type 1 allostasis, but elevated in type 2 allostasis.&lt;ref name = "Chatzitomaris_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chatzitomaris|first1=Apostolos|last2=Hoermann|first2=Rudolf|last3=Midgley|first3=John E.|last4=Hering|first4=Steffen|last5=Urban|first5=Aline|last6=Dietrich|first6=Barbara|last7=Abood|first7=Assjana|last8=Klein|first8=Harald H.|last9=Dietrich|first9=Johannes W.|title=Thyroid Allostasis–Adaptive Responses of Thyrotropic Feedback Control to Conditions of Strain, Stress, and Developmental Programming|journal=Frontiers in Endocrinology|date=20 July 2017|volume=8|pages=163|pmid=28775711|pmc=5517413|doi=10.3389/fendo.2017.00163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allostatic load==
{{main|Allostatic load}} 
In the long run, allostatic changes may fail to be adaptive as the maintenance of allostatic changes over a long period may result in wear and tear, the so-called [[allostatic load]]. If a dehydrated individual is helped but continues to be stressed and hence does not reinstate normal body function, the individual's body systems will wear out. The human body is adaptable, but it cannot maintain allostatic overload for very long without consequence.

==Controversy==
Trevor A. Day has argued that the concept of allostasis is no more than a renaming of the original concept of homeostasis {{harv|Day|2005}}.

Founded in 1974, the Argentine chapter was the first national chapter of the IASP to be created in Latin America. It organises a biannual academic conference, the ''Congreso Argentino de Dolor'', and was scheduled to be the organiser of the IASP's worldwide conference in 2014.

Among the association's political aims has been the promotion of a "right to treatment of pain" as a human right to be recognised by the [[United Nations]].

'''Baker Perkins Ltd''' is a British engineering company based in [[Peterborough]] offering manufacturing and process services to the [[food industry]] throughout the world.

==History==
The company has its origins with [[Jacob Perkins]] (1766-1849), an American inventor who moved to England in 1819 from [[Massachusetts]]. His son, [[Angier March Perkins]] (1799-1881), founded the firm of A. M. Perkins &amp; Co Ltd to manufacture his inventions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hevac-heritage.org/victorian_engineers/perkins/perkins.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the company merged with Werner &amp; Pfleiderer (London) to form Werner, Pfleiderer &amp; Perkins Ltd. In 1904, WP&amp;P moved their manufacturing from London to [[Westwood, Peterborough]]. In 1914, owing to pressure over its German-sounding name, the company became Perkins Engineers Ltd. During [[World War I]], the company produced a range of armaments including [[Harry Ricardo|Ricardo]] engines for [[Mark IV tank]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westwoodworks.net/HowItWas/WestwoodWorksInWW1/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 it merged with [[Joseph Allen Baker|Joseph Baker]] &amp; Sons Ltd of [[Willesden]] to become Joseph Baker Sons &amp; Perkins Ltd and in 1923, Baker Perkins Ltd.

By the time of the merger, Baker and Perkins were well-established names in the bakery, biscuit, confectionery, chocolate and chemical machinery industries. Just as the companies combined, the Bakers bought a factory in [[Saginaw]], Michigan, that for over 60 years was the base for manufacture of food and chemical equipment in North America.

Between the wars, the company manufactured a wide range of machinery including laundry equipment. 
In 1939, Baker Perkins was asked to take on production of the new [[QF 6 pounder 10 cwt gun|twin 6-pounder coast defence gun]] and also made components for a wide range of other artillery pieces.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westwoodworks.net/HowItWas/WestwoodWorksInWW2/index.htm#7&lt;/ref&gt;  Post war, Baker Perkins specialised in equipment for the food processing and printing industries.

==Later Mergers==
The business had expanded to become global in its organisation and sales when in 1987 the dairy and liquid food specialist, [[APV plc|APV]], acquired it. During this time the company relocated from old premises near the centre of Peterborough to a new purpose-built facility on the outskirts.

In 2006 Baker Perkins regained its historical name and its independence when it was acquired by private investors.

Most recently, Baker Perkins has introduced new moulding and forming technology for bread; developed equipment allowing confectioners to develop candies and lollipops; and pioneered technology expanding the variety of snacks and breakfast cereals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakerperkins.com/about-us/the-baker-perkins-story/ www.bakerperkins.com/about-us/the-baker-perkins-story] Detailed history of Baker Perkins&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker Perkins currently operates in two office locations, the headquarters being in [[Paston, Peterborough|Paston]], [[Peterborough]] with a second office in [[Grand Rapids]], Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bakerperkins.com/contact/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade Associations==
Baker Perkins maintains close links to the industries it serves through membership of key trade associations and research organisations. These include [[AACC International]], PMCA,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmca.com/membershiplisting.asp&lt;/ref&gt; BEMA and B&amp;CMA in the US: and the Leatherhead Food International&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leatherheadfood.com/member-services-member&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brewing Industry Research Foundation|Campden BRI]] in the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1414">A '''Barber–Johnson diagram'''{{example needed}} is a method of presenting hospital statistics combining four different variables in a unique [[Information graphics|graph]], introduced in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Barber B. and Johnson D., "The Presentation of Acute Hospital In-patient Statistics", ''Hospital and Health Services Review'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The method constructs a [[Scatter plot|scattergram]] where [[length of stay]], turnover interval, discharges, and deaths per available bed are combined. These four [[Dependent and independent variables|variable]]s have a common relationship between them and their combination in the diagram permitted a new improved way for analyzing [[Business efficiency|efficiency]] and performance of the hospital sector. The most complete reference about how to construct the diagram could be found in Yates.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, John (1982), ''Hospital Beds: A problem for diagnostic and management'', Heinemann Medical Books.
{{ISBN|0-433-37030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, the appendix explains in detail the way for elaborating this kind of diagram.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8841">The '''Belgian Red Cross''' is a humanitarian organization that aids in providing emergency and disaster related services and relief as well as providing education for disaster awareness within the population of [[Belgium]]. It is a member of the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.]] 

==Misson==
The mission of the Belgian Red Cross follows the same guidelines and principles of all [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement organizations.]] To prevent medical, [[psychological]], and [[sociological]] problems and crisis. As well as to aid in resolving such problems and issues through the implementation of trainings, educational development and through the overall assistance and presence of Red Cross members in times of turmoil. The members of this organization believe in the strength of social bonds amongst individuals as being the greatest preventative measure against isolation and [[marginalization]].

=== The Red Cross v The Red Crescent ===
The [[Red Cross]] and [[The Red Crescent]] are both [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] organizations that are dedicated to providing relief and assistance for [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], inspecting the conditions of prisons and helping in times of natural disasters.There really is not much that is different between the Red Cross and the Red Crescent other than their symbol. The cross is a symbol best known in [[Christianity|Christianity,]] and those that are Muslim do not particularly want to be represented with a Christian symbol; hence the crescent. The crescent is an Islamic symbol important to the [[Muslim|Muslims,]] similarly as the cross is to those of the Christian belief. Therefore, the Red Crescent and the Red Cross both provide primarily the same [[humanitarian]] services and aid as one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benthall|first=Jonathan|date=1997-11|title=The red cross and red crescent movement and Islamic societies, with special reference to Jordan|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13530199708705644|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=157–177|doi=10.1080/13530199708705644|issn=1353-0194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icrc.org/en/document/red-cross-red-crescent-and-red-crystal-what-do-they-mean-one-word-protection|title=The red cross, red crescent and red crystal.

==History and Organization==
===Founders===
The '''Belgian Red Cross''' was established in 1864 by Doctor Andrea Wegner and has its headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].
This national society was formed on February 4, 1864. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine2013_3/4-9.html|title=A movement is born|website=www.redcross.int|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Umbrella Organizations====
=====Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen=====
This is an [[Flemish]] independent volunteer based organization under the umbrella of The Belgian Red Cross and is a connected member of the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement. The mission of this umbrella organization is best divided into three parts. 
# The first mission is to provide protection and defend the interests of the respected populations, both in their homes and when abroad.
# The second part of this organization's mission statement is to encourage and teach self-reliance skills in order to best be proactive in the planning of an emergency.
# The third is being proactive in the organization of the supply of blood and other medical supplies in order to be able to provide the necessary care for the individuals in need.

The assistance from volunteers is what heavily drives this organization, and is the foundation on which it practices. ''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rodekruis.be/en/who-are-we/we-help-people/our-mission/|title=Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen - helpt helpen - Our mission|website=www.rodekruis.be|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;''
=====Croix-Rouge de Belgique=====

===Museum of Remembrance===
At the [[In Flanders Fields Museum|Flanders Fields Museum]] in Ypres, Belgium the world can reflect and remember the First World War, and the role that the Red Cross played during this wartime. It was created by the ICRC ([[International Committee of the Red Cross]]) Delegation to the EU ([[European Union]]), NATO ([[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]) and the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] and the Belgian Red Cross. The exhibit features the work both back during the war as well as currently; which allows the common eye to see the semblance that much of it has. In this exhibit visitors can look up if any of their ancestors or relatives were registered as a [[Prisoner of war|Prisoner of War]] during '14-18'. This exhibit was open to the public eye for viewing until the end of December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icrc.org/en/document/exhibition-belgium-red-cross-and-first-world-war|title=Exhibition in Belgium - the Red Cross and the First World War|date=2014-11-27|work=International Committee of the Red Cross|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seats are reserved, according to quotas set by the DGHS, for children of freedom fighters and for students from underprivileged backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bmchbd.com/admission-procedure-for-local-student/ |title=Admission Procedure for Local Student |website=Brahmanbaria Medical College |access-date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Campbell Collaboration is one of a number of groups promoting [[evidence-based policy]] in the [[social science]]s. Although it is an international collaboration, it tends to be focused more on the challenges of First World countries, where the social science research is better.&lt;ref name=holden-comment/&gt; The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) and the [[University of Ottawa]] established the International Development Coordinating Group (IDCG) in May 2011 to publish reviews on international development topics.

==History==

The Campbell Collaboration was created as a result of an exploratory meeting under the aegis of the School of Public Policy at [[University College London]] in July 1999.&lt;ref name=cochrane/&gt;&lt;ref name=background&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/background/index.php|title = Background|publisher = The Campbell Collaboration|accessdate = March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exploratory meeting proved fruitful and the Campbell Collaboration was created in 2000. The inaugural meeting was held at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]], United States, on 24–25 February 2000, and attracted 85 participants from 13 countries.&lt;ref name=cochrane/&gt;&lt;ref name=background/&gt;

The collaboration was named after the American psychologist [[Donald T. Campbell]] (1916-1996), a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=cochrane/&gt;&lt;ref name=background/&gt;

In December 2004, the [[American Psychological Association]] published an article on the work of the Campbell Collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec04/null.aspx|title = The significance of null: A group of social scientists hunts down unpublished studies and aims to inform policy through thorough meta-analysis.|last = Dingfelder|first = Sadie|date = December 2004|accessdate = March 26, 2014|publisher = [[American Psychological Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, a special issue of the [[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] was devoted to describing what the evidence-based approach of the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] and Campbell Collaboration had uncovered.&lt;ref name=hfrp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Place Randomized Trials: Experimental Tests of Public Policy (The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science Series) [Hardcover]|publisher = [[SAGE publications]]|date = May 1, 2005|isbn = 978-1412925815}}&lt;!--|accessdate = March 26, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use by other organizations==

Charity evaluator and [[effective altruism]] advocate [[GiveWell]] had listed the Campbell Collaboration as one of its sources of information when trying to assess the state of evidence for various social policies and interventions in the United States.&lt;ref name=holden-comment&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/united-states/process/sources-of-evidence|title = Criteria for evaluating U.S. programs|publisher = [[GiveWell]]|date = 2010|accessdate = March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; GiveWell co-director Holden Karnofsky later clarified that, since the Campbell Collaboration focus areas were not directly pertinent to development economics or improving the lives of poor people, the utility of their research to GiveWell's current areas of focus was limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/11/meta-research/comment-page-1/#comment-293370 | title = Comment on Meta-Research blog post|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = June 13, 2012|accessdate = March 26, 2014|publisher = [[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Social-Programs-That-Just-Dont-Work|title = Social Programs that Just Don't Work|publisher = [[GiveWell]]|accessdate = March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flemish '''Care Inspectorate''' (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Zorginspectie'') is a part of the [[Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family (Flanders)|Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family]] of the [[Flemish Government]]. The Flemish Government is the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of the [[Flemish Community]] of [[Belgium]]. In Belgium, the [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|Communities]] are responsible for the inspection of health and welfare services and establishments. The Care Inspectorate consists of two complementary divisions of the department: one for the inspection of [[Services and supports for people with disabilities|services for disabled people]] and [[Child care|child care services]], and one for the inspection of [[Welfare|welfare services]], [[Health care|health services]] (such as [[hospital]]s) and financial matters. Together, they inspect all services and establishments in these domains that are [[Legal recognition|recognised]], [[license]]d or [[Subsidy|subsidised]] by the department or any [[Government agency|agency]] associated with it. The Care Inspectorate also inspects disabled people who receive a so-called ''personal assistance budget'' or financial compensation for [[Assistive technology|assistive tools]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.departementwvg.be/zorginspectie-wie-zijn-we|title=Wie zijn we?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.departementwvg.be|publisher=Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family|language=Dutch|trans-title=Who are we?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807232141/https://www.departementwvg.be/zorginspectie-wie-zijn-we|archive-date=7 August 2018|dead-url=|access-date=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anno 2018, the Care Inspectorate has a staff of around 90 people, including about 70 inspectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2017, the Care Inspectorate conducted 4,678 inspections, about half of which were of child care services. Of these 4,678 inspections, 401 were conducted after a [[Consumer complaint|complaint]] was made with the Care Inspectorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dwvg.be/jaarverslag17/cijfers-zorginspectie|title=Cijfers Zorginspectie|last=|first=|date=2018|website=dwvg.be|publisher=Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family|language=Dutch|trans-title=Care Inspectorate Figures|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The predecessor to the current Care Inspectorate was officially founded on 1 April 2006, when the inspection services of the [[Child and Family Agency (Flanders)|Flemish Child and Family Agency]], the Flemish Agency for Persons with Disabilities, the Flemish Family and Social Welfare Administration, and the Flemish Health Care Administration were merged. The merger took place during the then-ongoing reorganisation of the Flemish administration. The newly found inspection service was given the status of an ''internally autonomous agency''. A few years later the agency was renamed as the "Care Inspectorate".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Under the [[Bourgeois Government]], which assumed office in 2014, the Care Inspectorate was merged with the Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family. As of 1 January 2015, the Care Inspectorate consists of two divisions of the department.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/organisatie/fusies/stand-van-zaken-fusies|title=Stand van zaken fusies|last=|first=|date=|website=overheid.vlaanderen.be|publisher=Flanders Information Agency|language=Dutch|trans-title=State of affairs mergers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807225232/https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/organisatie/fusies/stand-van-zaken-fusies|archive-date=7 August 2018|dead-url=|access-date=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inspection reports ==
Under local [[Freedom of information laws by country|open records laws]], anyone has a right to access the inspection reports made by the Care Inspectorate without having to give a reason. This is referred to as ''passive openness''. In some cases however, the Care Inspectorate can withhold (a part of) an inspection report from the public, for example when the report is not finished yet, or in order to protect the [[privacy]] of individuals. Since 2015, the Care Inspectorate also exercises what is referred to as ''active openness''. This means the Care Inspectorate actively works to make its reports public on its website. Aside from inspection reports, the public can also consult the results of [[Quality assurance|quality assessments]] of hospitals that participate in the so-called ''Flemish Indicator Project for Patients and Professionals'' (shortened to VIP² in Dutch) on a separate website. These quality assessments are about [[Breast cancer management|breast cancer treatment]] or [[patient experience]]s, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.departementwvg.be/zorginspectie-inspectieverslagen-en-openbaarheid|title=Inspectieverslagen en openbaarheid|last=|first=|date=|website=www.departementwvg.be|publisher=Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family|language=Dutch|trans-title=Inspection reports and openness|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coprophagia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|p|r|ə|ˈ|f|eɪ|dʒ|i|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coprophagia "Coprophagia"]. [[Dictionary.com]]. September 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''coprophagy''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|p|r|ɒ|f|ə|dʒ|i}}) is the consumption of [[feces]]. The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κόπρος ''copros'', "feces" and φαγεῖν ''phagein'', "to eat". ''Coprophagy'' refers to many kinds of feces-eating, including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or one's own (autocoprophagy) – those once deposited or taken directly from the [[anus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hirakawa |first1=H | year=2001 | title=Coprophagy in leporids and other mammalian herbivores | journal=Mammal Review | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=61–80|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/mam/2001/00000031/00000001/art00005 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2907.2001.00079.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, coprophagia has been observed in individuals with mental illnesses, as well as an unconventional sexual act. Some animal [[species]] eat feces as a normal behavior, in particular in the [[Lagomorpha]] (rabbits, hares, and pikas) doing so to allow tough plant materials to be digested more efficiently by passing twice through the digestive tract. Other species may [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|do so only under unusual conditions]].

==Humans==

Coprophagous insects consume and [[digestion|redigest]] the feces of large animals. These feces contain substantial amounts of semi-digested [[food]], particularly in the case of [[herbivore]]s, owing to the inefficiency of the large animals' [[Digestion|digestive systems]]. Two feces-eating insects are certain species of [[fly]] and the [[dung beetle]]. In regards to the [[dung beetle]], their diet is mainly in the form of the microorganism-rich liquid component that is present in the dung of mammals, while they take advantage of the fibrous material in the dung for the female to lay her fertilized eggs in.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, E.;Spector, S.;Louzada, J.;Larsen, T.;Amezquita, S.;Favila, M.E.

[[Termite]]s eat one another's feces as a means of obtaining their [[hindgut]] [[protist]]s. Termites and protists have a [[symbiotic]] relationship (e.g. with the protozoan that allows the termites to digest the cellulose in their diet). For example, in one group of termites, there is a three-way symbiotic relationship: termites of the family Rhinotermitidae, cellulolytic protists of the genus ''Pseudotrichonympha'' in the guts of these termites, and intracellular bacterial symbionts of the protists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cospeciation in the triplex symbiosis of termite gut protists (Pseudotrichonympha spp.), their hosts, and their bacterial endosymbionts.|author=Noda, S.|author2=Kitade, O.|author3=Inoue, T.|author4=Kawai, M.|author5=Kanuka, M.|author6=Hiroshima, K.|author7=Hongoh, Y.|author8=Constantino, R.|author9=Uys, V.|author10=Zhong, J.|author11=Kudo, T.|author12=Ohkuma, M.|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=16|issue=6|year=2007|pages=1257–1266|url=http://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline/citation/17391411/Cospeciation_in_the_triplex_symbiosis_of_termite_gut_protists__Pseudotrichonympha_spp___their_hosts_and_their_bacterial_endosymbionts_|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2006.03219.x|pmid=17391411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertebrates===
Domesticated and wild mammals are sometimes coprophagic, and in some species this forms an essential part of their method of digesting tough plant material.

Dogs may be coprophagic, possibly to rebalance their [[microbiome]] or to ingest missing nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brogan|first1=Jacob|title=Everyone Poops. Some Animals Eat It.

Species within the [[Lagomorpha]] ([[rabbit]]s, [[hare]]s, and [[pika]]s) produce two types of fecal pellets: hard ones, and soft ones called [[cecotrope]]s. Animals in these species reingest their cecotropes, to extract further nutrients. Cecotropes derive from chewed plant material that collects in the [[cecum]], a chamber between the large and small intestine, containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins. After [[egestion|excretion]] of the soft [[cecotrope]],  it is again eaten whole by the animal and redigested in a special part of the stomach. The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. This double-digestion process enables these animals to use nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and thus ensures that maximum nutrients are derived from the food they eat.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = rabbit | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | location = Chicago | edition = Standard | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process serves the same purpose within these animals as [[ruminant|rumination]] (cud-chewing) does in cattle and sheep.&lt;ref&gt;''The Private Life of the Rabbit'', R. M. Lockley, 1964. Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This reference is for the whole section, as written 30 July 2007 --&gt;

[[Cattle]] in the United States are often fed [[chicken litter]]. There are concerns that the practice of feeding chicken litter to cattle could lead to [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad-cow disease) because of the crushed [[meat and bone meal|bone meal]] in chicken feed. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates this practice by attempting to prevent the introduction of any part of a cow's brain or spinal cord into [[livestock]] feed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/18835/fda-urged-to-ban-feeding-chicken-litter-to-cattle FDA Urged to Ban Feeding Chicken Litter to Cattle], 2009-11-02, L.A.

The young of [[elephant]]s, [[Giant Panda|giant pandas]], [[koala]]s and [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]s eat the feces of their mothers or other animals in the herd, in order to obtain the [[bacteria]] required to properly digest [[vegetation]] found in their ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/adaptations/Coprophagia |title=BBC Nature&amp;nbsp;— Dung eater videos, news and facts |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such animals are born, their [[intestine]]s are sterile and do not contain these bacteria. Without doing this they would be unable to obtain any nutritional value from plants.

Hamsters, [[guinea pigs]], [[chinchillas]], [[hedgehogs]] and [[naked mole-rat]] eat their own droppings, which are thought to be a source of [[vitamin]]s [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin K|K]], produced by gut bacteria.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Gorilla]]s have been recorded to consume their feces extremely rarely, possibly out of boredom, a desire for warm food, or to reingest seeds contained in the feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.nycep.org/rothman/6PWUnutr.pdf |title=Nutritional Aspects of the Diet of Wild Gorillas |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants==
Some carnivorous plants, such as pitcher plants of the genus ''[[Nepenthes]]'', obtain nourishment from the feces of [[commensalism|commensal]] animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8552000/8552157.stm|title=BBC - Earth News - Giant meat-eating plants prefer to eat tree shrew poo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/51501-pitcher-plants-lure-pooping-bats.html|title=How Hungry Pitcher Plants Get the Poop They Need|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lewin reported that "...&amp;nbsp;consumption of fresh, warm [[camel]] feces has been recommended by [[Bedouin]]s as a remedy for bacterial [[dysentery]]; its efficacy (probably attributable to the antibiotic [[subtilisin]] from ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'') was anecdotally confirmed by German soldiers in Africa during World War II".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lewin, Ralph A.| title=More on merde| journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine| year=2001| volume=44| issue=4| pages=594–607| doi = 10.1353/pbm.2001.0067 | pmid = 11600805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuries ago, physicians tasted their patients' feces, to better judge their state and condition.&lt;ref&gt;notes to ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qsv_Y0DOVUsC The Works of Francis Rabelais, Volume II, Volume 2]'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Coprophagia is sometimes depicted in [[pornography]], usually under the term ''scat'' (from ''[[scatology]]'').&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 47893709 |page= 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'', a novel by the [[Marquis de Sade]] written in 1785, is full of detailed descriptions of erotic sadomasochistic coprophagia.&lt;ref&gt;le Marquis de Sade (1785) Les 120 journées de Sodome, ou L'École du Libertinage&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s award-winning 1973 novel ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' contains a detailed scene of coprophagia.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pynchon (1973) ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', Part 2, episode 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Rabelais]], in his classic ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', often employs the expression ''mâche-merde'' or ''mâchemerde'', meaning ''shit-chewer''. This in turn comes from the Greek comedians [[Aristophanes]] and particularly [[Menander]], who often use the term skatophagos (''σκατοϕφάγος'').&lt;ref&gt;Rabelais, Book 1, ch. 40 and Book 3 chap. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian actor and pornographic director {{ill|Simon Thaur|de}} created the series "Avantgarde Extreme" and "Portrait Extrem", which explores coprophagy, coprophilia and urolagnia. Modern Russian writer [[Vladimir Sorokin]]'s novel ''Norma'' describes a society where coprophagia is institutionalised and mandatory.

The '''corpus luteum''' ([[Latin]] for "yellow body"; plural '''corpora lutea''') is a temporary [[endocrine]] structure in female [[ovaries]] and is involved in the production of relatively high levels of [[progesterone]], moderate levels of [[estradiol]], [[inhibin A]] and small amounts of estrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/medical/sbpm_histology_old/lab/lab19_ovary.html|title=Histology Laboratory Manual|author=|date=|website=www.columbia.edu|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506050216/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/medical/sbpm_histology_old/lab/lab19_ovary.html|archivedate=6 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inquiry Into Biology|last=|first=|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson|year=2007|isbn=978-0-07-096052-7|location=|pages=497|type=Textbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the remains of the ovarian follicle that has released a mature ovum during a previous ovulation.{{sfn|Karch|page=657}}

The corpus luteum is colored as a result of concentrating [[carotenoid]]s (including [[lutein]]) from the diet and secretes a moderate amount of [[estrogen]] to inhibit further release of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) and thus secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). A new corpus luteum develops with each [[menstrual cycle]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Development and structure== &lt;!--Granulosa lutein cell and Theca lutein cell redirect here--&gt;
The ''corpus luteum'' develops from an [[ovarian follicle]] during the [[luteal phase]] of the [[menstrual cycle]] or [[oestrous cycle]], following the release of a secondary oocyte from the follicle during [[ovulation]]. The follicle first forms a [[corpus hemorrhagicum]] before it becomes a corpus luteum, but the term refers to the visible collection of blood, left after rupture of the follicle, that secretes progesterone. While the [[oocyte]] (later the [[zygote]] if fertilization occurs) traverses the [[Fallopian tube]] into the [[uterus]], the corpus luteum remains in the [[ovary]].

The corpus luteum is typically very large relative to the size of the ovary; in humans, the size of the structure ranges from under 2&amp;nbsp;cm to 5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref name="rbmonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbmonline.com/Article/2155 |title=FSH and follucogenesis: from physiology to ovarian stimulation |format= |work=Reproductive biomedicine Online |vauthors=Vegetti W, Alagna F |year=2006 |accessdate=2009-05-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715155817/http://www.rbmonline.com/Article/2155 |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progesterone is synthesized from cholesterol by both the large and small luteal cells upon luteal maturation.  Cholesterol-[[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] complexes bind to receptors on the plasma membrane of luteal cells and are internalized. Cholesterol is released and stored within the cell as cholesterol ester. LDL is recycled for further cholesterol transport.  Large luteal cells produce more progesterone due to uninhibited/basal levels of [[protein kinase A]] (PKA) activity within the cell. Small luteal cells have LH receptors that regulate PKA activity within the cell. PKA actively phosphorylates [[steroidogenic acute regulatory protein]] (StAR) and [[translocator protein]] to transport cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane.&lt;ref name="pmid11882010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Niswender GD | title = Molecular control of luteal secretion of progesterone | journal = Reproduction | volume = 123 | issue = 3 | pages = 333–9 |date=March 2002 | pmid = 11882010 | doi = 10.1530/rep.0.1230333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the corpus luteum is accompanied by an increase in the level of the steroidogenic enzyme [[P450scc]] that converts cholesterol to [[pregnenolone]] in the mitochondria.&lt;ref name="pmid9545562"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rapoport R, Sklan D, Wolfenson D, Shaham-Albalancy A, Hanukoglu I | title = Antioxidant capacity is correlated with steroidogenic status of the corpus luteum during the bovine estrous cycle | journal = Biochim.

During the bovine estrous cycle, plasma levels of progesterone increase in parallel to the levels of P450scc and its electron donor adrenodoxin, indicating that progesterone secretion is a result of enhanced expression of P450scc in the corpus luteum.&lt;ref name="pmid9545562" /&gt;

The mitochondrial P450 system electron transport chain including [[adrenodoxin reductase]] and [[adrenodoxin]] has been shown to leak electrons leading to the formation of superoxide radical.&lt;ref name="pmid8396893"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I, Rapoport R, Weiner L, Sklan D | title = Electron leakage from the mitochondrial NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase-adrenodoxin-P450scc (cholesterol side chain cleavage) system | journal = Arch.

Like the previous theca cells, the theca lutein cells lack the [[aromatase]] enzyme that is necessary to produce estrogen, so they can only perform [[steroidogenesis]] until formation of [[androgen]]s. The granulosa lutein cells do have aromatase, and use it to produce estrogens, using the androgens previously synthesized by the theca lutein cells, as the granulosa lutein cells in themselves do not have the [[17α-hydroxylase]] or [[17,20 lyase]] to produce androgens.{{sfn|Boron|page=1300}}
Once the corpus luteum regresses the remnant is known as [[corpus albicans]].&lt;ref name=Marieb&gt;{{cite book | last = Marieb | first = Elaine | title = Anatomy &amp; physiology | publisher = Benjamin-Cummings | location =  | page= 915 | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780321887603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The corpus luteum is essential for establishing and maintaining pregnancy in females. The corpus luteum secretes [[progesterone]], which is a [[steroid hormone]] responsible for the [[decidualization]] of the [[endometrium]] (its development) and maintenance, respectively. It also produces [[relaxin]], a hormone responsible for softening of the [[pubic symphysis]] which helps in parturition.

===When egg is not fertilized===
If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum stops secreting progesterone and decays (after approximately 10 days in humans). It then degenerates into a [[corpus albicans]], which is a mass of fibrous [[scar]] tissue.

The uterine lining (endometrium) is expelled through the vagina (in mammals that go through a [[menstrual cycle]]). In an [[estrous cycle]], the lining degenerates back to normal size.

===When egg is fertilized===
[[File:Ultrasonography of corpus luteum.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Vaginal ultrasound]] showing a corpus luteum in a pregnant woman, with a fluid-filled cavity in its center.]]
If the egg is fertilized and [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] occurs, the syncytiotrophoblast (derived from [[trophoblast]]) cells of the [[blastocyst]] secrete the hormone [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG, or a similar hormone in other species) by day 9 post-fertilization.

Human chorionic gonadotropin signals the corpus luteum to continue progesterone secretion, thereby maintaining the thick lining (endometrium) of the uterus and providing an area rich in [[blood vessel]]s in which the [[zygote]](s) can develop. From this point on, the corpus luteum is called the ''corpus luteum graviditatis''.

The introduction of [[prostaglandin]]s at this point causes the degeneration of the corpus luteum and the [[abortion]] of the [[fetus]]. However, in placental animals such as humans, the [[placenta]] eventually takes over progesterone production and the corpus luteum degrades into a [[corpus albicans]] without embryo/fetus loss.

[[Luteal support]] refers to the administration of medication (generally [[progestin]]s) for the purpose of increasing the success of [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] and early [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], thereby complementing the function of the corpus luteum.

===Content of carotenoids===

The yellow color and name of the corpus luteum, like that of the [[macula lutea]] of the retina, is due to its concentration of certain [[carotenoid]]s, especially [[lutein]].

The '''Davis Phinney Foundation''' is a non-profit with a mission to help people with Parkinson's live well with the disease. It was founded in 2004 by [[Davis Phinney]], the former professional road bicycle racer and Olympic medal winner. Phinney was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson's disease in 2000 at the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/davis-phinneys-memoir-offers-information-and-inspiration-for-living-well-with-parkinsons-disease-121884563.html|title=Davis Phinney's Memoir Offers Information and Inspiration for Living Well with Parkinson's Disease| publisher=PRNewswire |date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Davis is an inspirational figure in the cycling community and people living with Parkinson's (estimated 60,000 Americans and estimated 10 million worldwide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdf.org/en/parkinson_statistics|title=Statistics on Parkinson's|publisher=Parkinson's Disease Foundation|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation is a [[501(c)3]] public charity that functions without an endowment and depends on donations from individuals, foundations and corporations. It reaches an international audience through its programs and online programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ridetherockies.com/collaborations/|title=Collaborations|publisher=Ride The Rockies: The Denver Post|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As an Olympic Bronze medalist and Tour de France stage winner, Davis Phinney has celebrated the most victories of any cyclist in American history. From the late 1970s until his retirement from professional cycling in 1993, Davis achieved more wins – 328 victories in all – than any other US Cyclist.  Davis is one of only three Americans who have won multiple stages of the Tour de France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitywalk.org/bonander.php|title=Congratulations to Davis Phinney, recipient of the 2014 Alan Bonander Humanitarian Award|publisher=Parkinson's Unity Walk|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg LeMond and Lance Armstrong are the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Americans-in-the-Tour-185394.html|title=Americans in the Tour - Fun Facts, Questions, Answers, Information|publisher=Fun Trivia|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Davis was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson’s disease after years of feeling “off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbhof.org/inductee-by-year/80-davis-phinney|title=Davis Phinney Inducted in 2001 for Modern Road &amp; Track Competitor (Post-1975) |publisher=U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his Parkinson’s diagnosis, Davis and his family moved to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtobefit.com/davis-phinney.htm|title=Davis Phinney|author=Dan Koeppel|publisher=Howtobefit.com|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living there, Davis was contacted by Kathleen Krumme, a cyclist who asked Davis to let her use his name in conjunction with her ride (the Sunflower Revolution) to benefit Parkinson’s.  From this connection, the Davis Phinney Foundation was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucneuroscience.com/uncategorized/sunflower-revolution-marks-10-years-of-memories/|title=Sunflower Revolution Marks 10 Years of Memories|publisher=UC Neuroscience Institute, Cincinnati|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis realized there were many ways he could improve the quality of his daily life with Parkinson’s, including through exercise. He started the Davis Phinney Foundation as a way to fund and advance research that demonstrates the benefits of exercise, speech therapy and other behavioral elements that are critical to quality of life with Parkinson’s. It has since expanded to include a variety of programming that helps people with Parkinson’s take a more active role in their own care.&lt;ref name=windrose&gt;[http://www.windrosemedia.com/client/dpf/bios.htm "Davis Phinney"], Speaker Biographies, Windrose Media&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The Davis Phinney Foundation funds research that explores a range of factors that affect quality of life. Its primary interest is in funding research related to exercise; however, it has also funded research in depression, telemedicine, deep brain stimulation and speech.&lt;ref name=windrose /&gt; The tendency is to fund smaller, innovative studies that lead to proof of concept and greater funding from larger institutions, such as the National Institute of Health and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kintera.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=mvKWLaMOIqG&amp;b=5193111&amp;ct=7035723&amp;notoc=1|title=DPF Funded Research |publisher=Davis Phinney Foundation|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising Activities==
The Foundation’s [[grassroots fundraising]] initiative, [http://www.davisphinneyfoundation.org/victory-crew/ The Victory Crew], raises funds and awareness for Parkinson’s disease. Victory Crew members turn all types of events and activities, from bike rides and runs, to mountain climbs, to sales of original works of art into fundraisers benefiting the Foundation. The Davis Phinney Foundation also has a Pay It Forward initiative tied to The Victory Summit symposia, wherein attendees of the free events are asked to donate in order to fund future events. Fully 81% of the Foundation’s revenue is devoted to funding program services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kintera.org/site/c.mvKWLaMOIqG/b.5186791/k.2A7E/Join_The_Davis_Phinney_Foundation_in_the_Parkinson8217s_fight__Get_Involved.htm?kntaw38761=A286B65850234F988CCC347444BB3946|title=Join The Davis Phinney Foundation in the Parkinson’s fight - Get Involved! |publisher=Davis Phinney Foundation|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[agriculture]], '''disease management''' is the practice of minimising disease in crops to increase quantity or quality of harvest yield.

Organisms that cause infectious disease in crops include [[fungus|fungi]], [[oomycete]]s, [[bacteria]], [[plant virus|viruses]], [[viroid]]s, virus-like organisms, [[phytoplasma]]s, [[protozoa]], [[nematode]]s and [[parasitic plant]]s. Crops can also suffer from ectoparasites including [[insects]], [[mites]], [[snail]]s, [[slug]]s, and [[vertebrate]] animals, but these are not considered diseases.

'''Illegal drug abuse''' is the action of using drugs that are prohibited by the government or strictly controlled by means of prescription to alter one’s consciousness and emotions. The Hong Kong government has a zero tolerance policy against illegal drug use. Drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy, which can be considered recreational drugs in other countries are all illegal in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;Boland, R. (n.d.). Drugs in Hong Kong. Retrieved from http://gohongkong.about.com/od/healthandsaftey/fl/Drugs-in-Hong-Kong.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Illegal drug abuse remains one of the major problems among adolescents in Hong Kong. This trend dropped in the mid-1990s, but reappeared in the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Chan Wai Leung, Chu Fung, Wong Pui Ling, Yu Kai Ming Caritas – Hong Kong. Innovative Intervention Mode for Young Recreational Drug Users in Hong Kong — Changing through acting. Part 2: Changing drug abuse patterns and law enforcement strategies.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Narcotics Division (2002). Central Registry of Drug Abuse – Fifty-first Report. Hong Kong: Security Bureau, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People’s Republic of China&lt;/ref&gt; The increase of consumption of illegal drugs among adolescents in Hong Kong can be attributed to the global trend of recreational drug use at nightclubs and rave parties. Following the popularisation of nightclubs and rave culture in Hong Kong, the abuse of party drugs such as ecstasy and ketamine has been on the rise since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, N. W., &amp; Cheung, Y. W. (2006). Is Hong Kong experiencing normalisation of adolescent drug use? Some reflections on the normalisation thesis. Substance use &amp; misuse, 41(14), 1967-1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yuen, ECP. (2001). The common drugs of abuse in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Journal of Emergency Medicine, 8(2), 90-95. Retrieved from http://www.hkcem.com/html/publications/Journal/2001-2/90-95.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon causes a huge impact on adolescents, considering that the consumption of illegal drugs impacts both emotional and physical health, potentially causing long lasting damage.

Despite Hong Kong being a relatively safe city, and the Hong Kong government’s efforts in controlling the use of illegal substances, drug abuse is still a prevailing issue in Hong Kong. Each year, more than 2000 people are reported to have taken illicit drugs for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Central Registry of Drug Abuse.(12.19.2014). Newly/previously reported drug abusers by age. Retrieved from http://www.nd.gov.hk/statistics_list/doc/en/t1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to Hong Kong's relatively lenient punishment for those found to have possessed illegal drugs and adolescent's receptive viewpoint regarding drug use as a normal part of leisure, as well as easy access of party drugs in club settings. Sometimes, the judge will only ask the offender to bind over or charge the offender with a fine after they are convicted.&lt;ref&gt;Lau, S. (2000, September 19).

==Popular illegal drugs in Hong Kong==
The following substances listed, all considered illegal in Hong Kong, are in order of popularity:&lt;ref&gt;Common Drugs. (2015, March 1). Retrieved from http://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/04_crime_matters/drug/common_drug.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Central Registry of Drug Abuse.(12.19.2014). Newly/previously reported drug abusers by age group by common type of drugs abused. Retrieved from http://www.nd.gov.hk/statistics_list/doc/en/t3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Ketamine]]- a [[general anaesthetic]] used in intensive care by doctors for its pain relieving and sedative qualities.
*[[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]]- Cannabis often referred to as marijuana, weed or pot is often used for its psychoactive and physiological effects.
*[[MDMA]]- also known as ecstasy, is a [[psychoactive]] drug that induces hallucinogenic properties. The popularisation of ecstasy became popular mid 90’s because of its association with western club culture and Raves.
*[[Cocaine]]- a white powdery substance extracted from the leaves of the coca plant, and is considered the strongest natural stimulant.
*[[Methamphetamine]]- a strong [[central nervous system]] [[stimulant]] in the amphetamine class used to treat [[ADHD]].
*[[Heroin]]- an opioid [[analgesic]], derived from the opium poppy, a narcotic drug that is four times stronger than morphine.
*[[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]]- a central nervous system suppressant with anti-anxiety effects at lower doses. In higher doses, the sedative effects of GHB can induce sleep, which can potentially lead to a coma. GHB is also known as a date rape drug.&lt;ref&gt;DrugFacts: Club Drugs (GHB, Ketamine, and Rohypnol). (2014, December 1). Retrieved from http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/club-drugs-ghb-ketamine-rohypnol&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalties==
Illegal drug use in Hong Kong is regarded as a narcotics offence, and if caught penalties include imprisonment for seven years and a fine of HK$1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;Laws &amp; Penalties. (2015, March 1). Retrieved from http://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/04_crime_matters/drug/law_pen.html&lt;/ref&gt; From the statistics of drug offences in 2015 released by The Secretary for Security, Lai Tung-Kwok, there are 1855 serious drug offences in total. 414 offences less compared to 2013 nearly 450 young adults were arrested because of serious offences, such as possession and use of illegal drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript remarks made by the Secretary for Security, Mr Lai Tung-kwok, at a media session at Central Government Offices meeting.(5.2.2015). Retrieved from http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201502/05/P201502050973.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
There is no sufficient evidence suggesting that behavioural intervention can prevent illegal drug use.&lt;ref&gt;Patnode, C., O’Connor E, Rowland M, et al.  (2014). Scope and Purpose. In Primary care behavioural interventions to prevent or reduce illicit drug and non-medical pharmaceutical use in children and adolescents: A systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent people from taking drugs in Hong Kong, there are numerous agencies such as non-government organisations and anti-drug organisations funded by the government set up to help educate the general public about the dangers of substance abuse and to help people with substance abuse problems.&lt;ref&gt;Social Welfare Department.(2014).List of Subvented Residential Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation Centres and Halfway Houses. Retrieved from http://www.swd.gov.hk/doc/DrugAbusers/DTRC_20140617e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Narcotics Division launched anti-drug policies and measures providing programs to strengthen Hong Kong citizens awareness of hidden problems of drug abuse. It also set up a 24-hour hotline to provide services and professional social workers to give suggestions to those in need. The Caritas Youth and Community Service, and Play Safe Healthy Life Service strive to help adolescents with substance abuse problems through providing crisis intervention services and drug education.

==Recreational drug use==
[[Recreational drug use]] is characterised by the use of drugs with psychoactive effects without medical justification for personal enjoyment. Recreational drug use in Hong Kong among young adults has been in the rise in recent decades,&lt;ref&gt;Narcotics Division (2002). Central Registry of Drug Abuse – Fifty-first Report. Hong Kong: Security Bureau, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People’s Republic of China&lt;/ref&gt; popularised by the introduction of club culture in the West and adolescents open-minded attitude towards illegal drug use as a normal part of leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, N. W., &amp; Cheung, Y. W. (2006). Is Hong Kong experiencing a normalization of adolescent drug use? Some reflections on the normalization thesis. Substance use &amp; misuse, 41(14), 1967-1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The revival of this trend is connected to the change in drug abuse pattern of adolescents, mainly from party drugs such as ketamine and MDMA. The popularisation of party drugs in nightclubs and raves are due to its ability to elevate moods, promoting the dancing atmosphere and a sense of euphoria.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, R.S. (1998). The Love Drug: marching to the beat of ecstasy. NY: The Haworth Medical Press&lt;/ref&gt; Along with MDMA and ketamine, cannabis, cocaine and GHB is considered the more popular illegal drug of choice for adolescents. 78% of adolescents attending nightclubs chose ketamine and 66% would use MDMA, and less than 12% would use other drugs such as cannabis and methamphetamine.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, W.L.

'''Cigarette smoking''' has been found to affect global [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] regulation of transcription across tissue types. Studies have shown differences in epigenetic markers like [[DNA methylation]], [[histone modification]]s and [[miRNA]] expression between smokers and non-smokers. Similar differences exist in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. These epigenetic effects are thought to be linked to many of negative health effects associated with smoking.

==Health impact==

It has been well established that smoking cigarettes has a number of negative health effects, including increased risk for [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD).&lt;ref name="Lee2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee KW, Pausova Z | title = Cigarette smoking and DNA methylation | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 4 | pages = 132 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23882278 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2013.00132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children exposed prenatally to cigarette smoke demonstrate increased risk for [[Intrauterine growth restriction|fetal growth restriction]], [[sudden infant death syndrome]], and [[addictive behavior]]s later in life, as well as a host of other secondary health effects. It is thought that epigenetic changes that arise from smoking cigarettes or exposure to cigarette smoke play a role in the development of these conditions.

Epigenetic modifications to the genome, including [[Histone|histone modifications]], [[DNA methylation]], and the modulation of [[RNA interference|RNAi]], are major epigenetic events used to modulate gene expression. When the [[epigenome]] of an organism is altered by an environmental cue like smoking, gene expression changes accordingly. Changes in the regulation of critical genes can have disastrous consequences on health and quality of life. Irregular gene expression is one of the hallmarks of [[cancer]], but is also found in a number of diseases and disorders.

==Mechanisms for changes in DNA methylation==

One of the most prominent and well studied epigenetic consequences of cigarette smoke is altered DNA methylation. Cigarette smoke acts through a number of mechanisms to effect this, chief among these being smoke induced damage to the DNA and altered expression levels of proteins involved in DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation.

===Damage to DNA===
Chemicals in smoke can damage DNA, which subsequently leads to changes in DNA methylation during the repair process. Damage typically comes in the form of double-strand breaks that are linked to carcinogens like [[arsenic]], [[chromium]], [[formaldehyde]], [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], and [[nitrosamine]]s which are found in cigarette smoke. [[DNA methyltransferase|DNMT1]] is the enzyme involved in the maintenance of DNA methylation marks. [[DNA methyltransferase|DNMT1]] is recruited to DNA during its replication, or during DNA repair. As a new DNA strand is synthesized, unmethylated cytosines are incorporated into the sequence. This leads to hemimethylated DNA, where an older methylated strand is bound to a younger unmethylated one. 

[[DNA methyltransferase|DNMT1]] is an enzyme which recognizes and corrects hemimethylation by transferring the appropriate methyl groups to the newly synthesized strand. Like all biological processes, DNMT1 based hemimethylation correction is not perfect. Mistakes in hemimethylation correction can occur, and are more likely to appear the more a DNA sequence is replicated or repaired. This is compounded by the fact that cigarette smoke compromises the expression
and activity of [[DNMT1]]. The end result is a decrease in the body's ability to maintain proper methylation patterns, leading to misexpression of genes.

===Effects on DNA methylating proteins ===
Exposure to cigarette smoke impacts proteins involved in [[DNA methylation]]. These effects come from either hypoxia induced by the cigarette smoke, or the chemical consequences of [[nicotine]].
Inhaling cigarette smoke increases blood levels of [[carbon monoxide]] which negatively affects oxygenation throughout the body leading to hypoxia.&lt;ref name="Lee2013" /&gt; One response to hypoxia is the upregulation in synthesis of the major methyl donor [[S-adenosylmethionine]]. Upregulation of this methyl donor through heightened expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 2A leads to increased DNA methylation, which can lead to the down-regulation of target genes. 
[[Nicotine]] found in cigarette smoke binds to [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s.&lt;ref name="Lee2013"/&gt; 

This binding leads to an increase in calcium levels which in turn can activate the [[cAMP response element-binding protein]] (CREB) transcription factor. The most striking downstream effect of the upregulation of this transcription factor is the downregulation of the [[DNMT1]] gene, which has a cAMP response element in its promoter. This down-regulation of [[DNMT1]] can have serious consequences on DNA methylation, namely a failure to maintain normal methylation patterns during DNA replication and repair. The upregulation of [[DNMT3b]] has also been shown to occur as a result of cigarette exposure.&lt;ref name="Desir2012"/&gt; 

[[DNMT3b]] is thought to be critical to de novo methylation, or the production of new methylation marks on DNA. This increased expression of [[DNMT3b]] and methionine adenosyltransferase 2A, taken together with the down-regulation of [[DNMT1]], results in myriad unintended epigenetic consequences.

===Effects on transcription factors===
[[Sp1 transcription factor|Sp1]], a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in early development, was shown to be expressed at higher rates in lung epithelial cells in the presence of cigarette-smoke condensate.&lt;ref name="Lee2013"/&gt; This is relevant because Sp1 binds to GC-rich promoter regions which prevent the methylation of these regions during embryonic development. Increased Sp1 expression can lead to a global reduction in DNA methylation, leading to a number of downstream health effects in developing embryos exposed to maternal cigarette smoke.

==Consequences of altered DNA methylation==

Regardless of mechanism, several known differences in DNA methylation have been observed between smokers and non-smokers. An overall average decrease in DNA methylation is observed, leading to an increase in the expression of a number of genes. Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the [[Cytochrome P450, family 1, member A1|CYP1A1]] xenobiotic response element, [[Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor|AHRR]], and [[F2RL3]]. CYP1A1 is critical to the detoxification of carcinogens, and is found to be hypomethylated in frequent smokers. [[Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor|AHRR]] and [[F2RL3]] are similarly hypomethylated in smokers.&lt;ref name="Lee2013"/&gt;

[[Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor|AHRR]] is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals. The resultant increase in [[Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor|AHRR]] expression could lead to a decrease in the body's ability to break down carcinogens, increasing the risk of cancer. [[F2RL3]] is known to be involved in blood clotting and the inflammation response.&lt;ref name="Lee2013"/&gt; Effects on the regulation of [[F2RL3]] in particular could be a link between epigenetic changes from smoking and increased risk of heart disease. Time specific changes in methylation of D4Z4 and NBL2 repeats, which are known factors in carcinogenesis, have also been observed.&lt;ref name="Desir2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lovinsky-Desir S, Miller RL | title = Epigenetics, asthma, and allergic diseases: a review of the latest advancements | journal = Current Allergy and Asthma Reports | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 211–20 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22451193 | doi = 10.1007/s11882-012-0257-4 | pmc = 3358775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though smoking leads to an overall decrease in DNA methylation, several critical genes become hypermethylated. Two of the most noteworthy of these genes are [[p16]] and [[p53]]. These genes are critical to cell cycle regulation and were shown to have higher levels of methylation in smokers than in non smokers.&lt;ref name="Talikka2012" /&gt; The subsequent loss of function of these genes could potentially lead to dysregulation of the cell cycle, wherein cells are able to bypass normal growth impeding signals. Ultimately, uncontrolled cellular divisions and failure to properly regulate the cell cycle leads to cancer.

Fetuses exposed in utero to cigarette smoke are also known to have some distinct epigenetic differences from smoke-free cohorts. CYP1A1 was found to be hypomethylated in the placentas of fetuses prenatally exposed to cigarette smoke, along with the transposable element AluYB8.&lt;ref name="Knopik2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knopik VS, Maccani MA, Francazio S, McGeary JE | title = The epigenetics of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and effects on child development | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 1377–90 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23062304 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579412000776 | pmc = 3581096 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Methylation of transposable elements is one of the primary ways they are prevented from replicating or moving within the genome. Similarly observed hypomethylation in a number of [[Alu elements]] results in a general decrease in genomic stability and an increase in the risk of cancer from mutation resulting from the random insertion of transposable elements.&lt;ref name="Desir2012"/&gt; 

Strikingly, [[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]] appears to be hypermethylated in children who were exposed to smoke prenatally. BDNF is critical to long term memory formation and the upkeep of neurons. Downregulation of BDNF has also been linked to clinical depression.&lt;ref name="Knopik2012"/&gt; Taken as a whole, the epigentic consequences of prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke result in increased metabolic stress, decreased genomic stability, heightened risk of mutation and altered brain development.

==Effects on histone modifications==

[[Histone modification]]s are another epigenetic phenomenon known to be affected by smoking. Cigarette smoke has been observed to globally alter [[histone modification]]s near the promoter regions of pro-inflammatory genes, mainly through an overall increase in acetylation.&lt;ref name="Talikka2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Talikka M, Sierro N, Ivanov NV, Chaudhary N, Peck MJ, Hoeng J, Coggins CR, Peitsch MC | title = Genomic impact of cigarette smoke, with application to three smoking-related diseases | journal = Critical Reviews in Toxicology | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 877–89 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22989067 | doi = 10.3109/10408444.2012.725244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Yang2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang SR, Valvo S, Yao H, Kode A, Rajendrasozhan S, Edirisinghe I, Caito S, Adenuga D, Henry R, Fromm G, Maggirwar S, Li JD, Bulger M, Rahman I | title = IKK alpha causes chromatin modification on pro-inflammatory genes by cigarette smoke in mouse lung | journal = American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 689–98 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18239189 | doi = 10.1165/rcmb.2007-0379OC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cigarette smoke can alter histone acetylation through a number of pathways. Chief among these is the degradation of [[Histone deacetylase 2|HDAC2]], thereby preventing the removal of acetylation marks in affected cells. The degradation of this enzyme results from phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination induced by cigarette smoke.&lt;ref name="Talikka2012"/&gt;

In rat and mouse models, cigarette smoke was observed to increase acetylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9), lysine 12 on histone H4 (H4K12) and phosphorylation of serine 10 on histone H3 (H3S10). These marks are associated with an increase in gene expression and prevent the accumulation of repressive [[histone modification]]s. Mechanistically, the increased frequency of these marks, especially the modifications on histone H3, are linked to the activation of [[CHUK|IKK-α]] which directly phosphorylates histone H3 as a consequence of exposure to cigarette smoke. It is thought that this increase in acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in [[macrophages]] in the [[alveolus]] could potentially lead to the development of COPD.

==Effects on miRNA==

[[MicroRNA]]s, or miRNAs, are known to be major epigenetic regulators of gene expression in humans. These RNAs are short molecules which bind to [[mRNA]] through complementary base pairing. This binding impacts the expression of proteins encoded by those [[mRNA]]s by either inducing the cleavage of the [[mRNA]], destabilizing the molecule, or limiting the efficiency of its translation. Unlike differences in DNA methylation, changes in miRNA activity induced by cigarette smoke are largely unknown.&lt;ref name="Lee2013"/&gt; Primary research data suggests that cigarette smoke promotes the dysregulation of a number of miRNA's. One such study showed that cigarette smoke downregulates miR-16, miR-21, and miR-146a in the placenta.&lt;ref name="Maccani2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maccani MA, Avissar-Whiting M, Banister CE, McGonnigal B, Padbury JF, Marsit CJ | title = Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy is associated with downregulation of miR-16, miR-21, and miR-146a in the placenta | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 583–9 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20647767 | pmc = 2974801 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A downregulation of miR-16 is predicted to inhibit apoptosis via the subsequent upregulation of [[BCL2L2]] and [[Ectodysplasin A|EDA]], both of which contribute to anti-apoptotic signaling. Downregulaton of miR-146a is predicted to influence the expression of [[TRAF6]], which has a number of downstream effects, including regulation of  inflammatory responses and anti-apoptotic signaling. Taken as a whole, dysregulation of these miRNA's could lead to dysregulation of normal cell death, cell cycling and immune responses, all of which have negative health impacts and could potentially lead to cancerous growths and improper placental formation.

'''The Fairweather Lodge Program''' is a [[psychosocial rehabilitation]] model in which residents live together and run or participate in a business that provides them with employment. As of 2006, there were over 90 Fairweather Lodges in 16 US states.

==History==
The Fairweather Lodge Program was developed by [[psychologist]] George Fairweather in California in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Fairweather found that  patients with serious and persistent [[mental illness]] were less likely  to require rehospitalization (i.e., "community tenure" is longer)when they lived and worked together in the community as a group, rather than individually.

==Lodge model==

A “Fairweather Lodge” is a home that offers support for adults with mental illness. The Lodge setting is shared, independent housing and can be offered either short-term or long-term, depending on the needs and desires of the individual. Lodge members are active, productive  men and women who share the responsibilities of household management and support each other in recovery. This interdependence  relies on the skills and competencies of each individual and utilizes them to create a family style of living. By residing together, each  member’s potential standard of living can be greatly improved through companionship, shared expenses and mutual peer support. A Lodge managed by its members through group decision-making. While staff, provided by a sponsoring agency, may serve as advisors and be available in emergencies, on-site staffing is very limited. 
The Fairweather Lodge model also includes an employment component, with the understanding that participation  in gainful employment supports mental health recovery. To provide employment, a Lodge may run a [[small business]] chosen by member consensus and jointly planned. Alternatively, the sponsoring agency may provide employment to Lodge residents through its own business initiatives.

==Program principles==
1. The lodge must provide the residents a safe, healthy and caring environment that reinforces the recovery process. 

2. The lodge must be a part of the overall plan for managing the residents' mental health symptoms and promoting  good mental health.

3. The sponsor must provide services to the residents as long as they want and need them. The lodge must allow open entry and exit for the residents.
 
4. Residents with [[psychiatric]] disabilities can increase their community success and raise their social status through employment, through accumulating [[wealth]] and through direct [[consumerism]].  

5. Aside from their roles in the lodge business, residents need to have meaningful roles in the larger community.

6. A successful lodge resembles a family. 

7. In order to progress, residents with psychiatric disabilities need [[autonomy]] that is commensurate with their  abilities with the ultimate goal is full autonomy. The lodge must provide its residents with as much autonomy as possible. 

8. The lodge must not depend on resources from any single entity, or on the philanthropy of its host community.

==Coalition for Community Living==
The Coalition for Community Living (CCL) is a national organization that promotes the Fairweather Lodge model and monitors the lodge programs. 

Each quarter, the CCL collects [[outcome data]] on each lodge to determine if it can be certified as a Fairweather Lodge. The outcome measures gauge adherence to the Faiweather principles and are designed to track meaningful quality of life indicators, such as safety and desirability of housing, access to quality mental health services, employment and earnings, healthy lifestyle and community belonging and personal autonomy.

'''Saint-Firmin (S. F.) Monestime''' (December 16, 1909 – October 27, 1977) was a [[Haiti]]an-[[Canadians|Canadian]] politician and medical doctor, who was the first [[Black Canadian]] elected [[mayor]] of a Canadian municipality.&lt;ref name=pastforward&gt;[http://www.pastforward.ca/perspectives/columns/07_10_26.htm "Mattawa's Dr. Firmin Monestime Remembered"], ''[[North Bay Nugget]]'', October 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Cap-Haïtien]] in 1909,&lt;ref name=embassy&gt;[http://ambassade-haiti.ca/ambassade/evenements/visite-de-lambassadeur-a-mattawa "Visite de l’Ambassadeur à Mattawa"]. [[Embassy of Haiti, Ottawa|Embassy of Haiti in Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; Monestime studied rural medicine and wrote three books on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL6492780M|title=... Conférences de médecine rurale (Open Library)|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, he was one of the only doctors on duty during the [[Parsley Massacre]], and was subsequently awarded the Haitian Legion of Merit for his work during that crisis.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

He moved to [[Quebec City]] in the 1940s. After upgrading his medical training he planned a move to [[Timmins]], [[Ontario]] to set up a medical practice, but when he stopped in [[Mattawa, Ontario|Mattawa]] en route, he was convinced by a restaurant owner to stay in that town and set up practice there instead. He married Zena Petschersky, an immigrant from [[Danzig]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baytoday.ca/content/obituaries/print.asp?c=9980|title=MONESTIME, Zenaida Feodorovna (Zena) Petschersky|work=BayToday.ca|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he met in [[Ottawa]] in 1953.

Monestime practiced medicine in Mattawa until 1964, when he was elected the town's mayor. Except for one year that he took off for personal reasons, he remained mayor until his death in 1977.

Monestime was active with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]], and served as its national director. He considered running federally for the party, and in 1971 he ran and lost in a bid for the presidency of the party.&lt;ref&gt;"Choice of president shows Tories aiming at Ontario voters". ''[[Ottawa Journal]]'', December 8, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Red Tory]], Monestime was attracted to the party because of Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]]'s [[Canadian Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;''Where Rivers Meet: The Story of Dr. S. F. Monestime'', Doug Mackey.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 29, 1976, Monestime's 21-year-old son, Fedia, was shot and killed outside the Trans-Canada Hotel in Mattawa. He was in a group chasing a man who had fired his rifle into the wall after a bar fight, when the man fired on them, also injuring three others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19760301&amp;id=icsyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r-0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5952,24663|title=Hotel fight leads to man's death|date=March 1, 1976|publisher=''[[Ottawa Citizen]]''|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph Childerhose was charged with murder and acquitted, a decision Monestime considered unjust.&lt;ref name=pastforward/&gt;

Monestime and his wife established a [[nursing home]] in Mattawa in 1975. His daughter Vala Monestime Belter continues to run the home today, and has served on the boards of [[Ontario Northland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/news/NRView.asp?NRNUM=123&amp;NRYear=1996&amp;NRLAN=EN&amp;NRID=2036 Hodgson Announces New ONTC Board of Directors], June 20, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TVOntario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvo.org/about/AnnualReports/AR_TVO_03_04_EN.pdf TVOntario Annual Report 2003-04]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Frantz Liautaud, the current ambassador of Haiti to Canada, visited Mattawa for a gala celebration of the 50th anniversary of Monestime's first election as mayor.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

[[Image:Esmarch.jpg|thumb|Friedrich von Esmarch, statue by A. Brütt in Tönning (1905)]]

'''Johannes Friedrich August von Esmarch''' (9 January 1823 – 23 February  1908) was a  [[Germany|German]] [[surgeon]]. He developed the [[Esmarch bandage]] and founded the ''Deutscher Samariter-Verein'', the predecessor of the ''[[Deutscher Samariter-Bund]]''.

== Life ==

Esmarch was born in [[Tönning]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. He studied at [[university of Kiel|Kiel]] and [[university of Göttingen|Göttingen]], and in 1846 became [[Bernhard Rudolf Konrad von Langenbeck]]'s assistant at the Kiel surgical hospital. He served in the [[First Schleswig War|Schleswig-Holstein War of 1848]] as junior surgeon, and this directed his attention to the subject of military [[surgery]]. He was taken prisoner, but afterwards exchanged, and was then appointed as surgeon to a [[field hospital]]. During the truce of 1849 he qualified as ''[[Privatdocent]]'' at Kiel, but on the fresh outbreak of war he returned to the troops and was promoted to the rank of senior surgeon.

In 1854 Esmarch became director of the surgical clinic at Kiel, and in 1857 head of the general hospital and professor at the [[University of Kiel]]. During the [[Second Schleswig War|Schleswig-Holstein War of 1864]], Esmarch rendered good service to the field hospitals of [[Flensburg]], [[Sundewitt]] and Kiel. In 1866 he was called to [[Berlin]] as member of the hospital commission, and also to take the superintendence of the surgical work in the hospitals there. When the [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out in 1870, he was appointed surgeon-general to the army, and afterwards consulting surgeon at the great military hospital near Berlin.

In 1872 Esmarch married Princess [[Henriette of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg|Caroline Christiane Auguste Emilie Henriette Elisabeth]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg]] (1833–1917), aunt of Empress [[Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein|Augusta Viktoria]]. In 1887 a patent of nobility was conferred on Esmarch. He died at Kiel.

== Influence ==
[[File:FriedrichVonEsmarch.jpg|thumb|right]]
Esmarch was one of the greatest authorities on hospital management and military surgery. His ''Handbuch der kriegschirurgischen Technik'' was written for a prize offered by the empress Augusta, on the occasion of the Vienna Exhibition of 1877, for the best handbook for the battlefield of surgical appliances and operations. This book is illustrated by admirable diagrams, showing the different methods of bandaging and dressing, as well as the surgical operations as they occur on the battlefield. Esmarch himself invented an apparatus, which bears his name, for keeping a limb nearly bloodless during [[amputation]].

No part of Esmarch's work is more widely known than that which deals with [[First Aid]], his ''First Aid on the Battlefield'' and ''First Aid to the Injured'' being popular manuals on the subject. The latter is the substance of a course of lectures delivered by him in 1881 to a [[Samaritan]] School, the first of the kind in Germany, founded by Esmarch in 1881, in imitation of the [[St John Ambulance]] classes which had been organized in England in 1878. These lectures were very generally adopted as a manual for first aid students, edition after edition having been called for, and they have been translated into numerous languages, the English version being the work of HRH Princess Christian.

No ambulance course would be complete without a demonstration of the [[Esmarch bandage]]. It is a three-sided piece of linen or cotton, of which the base measures 4 feet and the sides 2 feet 10 inches. It can be used folded or open, and applied in thirty-two different ways. It answers every purpose for temporary dressing and field-work, while its great recommendation is that the means for making it are always at hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7226">'''Functional training''' is a classification of [[exercise]] which involves training the body for the activities performed in [[Everyday life|daily life]].

==Origins==
Functional training has its origins in [[therapy|rehabilitation]].  [[Physical therapy|Physical]] and [[Occupational therapy|occupational]] therapists and [[Chiropractic|chiropractors]] often use this approach to retrain patients with movement disorders. Interventions are designed to incorporate task and context specific practice in areas meaningful to each patient, with an overall goal of functional independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Sullivan|first=Susan B.|title=Physical Therapy 5th Edition|year=2007|publisher=F.A. Davis Company|location=glossary|isbn=0-8036-1247-8|pages=1335}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, exercises that mimic what patients did at home or work may be included in treatment in order to help them return to their lives or jobs after an injury or surgery.  Thus if a patient's job required repeatedly heavy lifting, rehabilitation would be targeted towards heavy lifting, if the patient were a parent of young children, it would be targeted towards moderate lifting and endurance, and if the patient were a [[marathon]] runner, training would be targeted towards re-building endurance. However, treatments are designed after careful consideration of the patient’s condition, what he or she would like to achieve, and ensuring goals of treatment are realistic and achievable.

Functional training attempts to adapt or develop exercises which allow individuals to perform the activities of daily life more easily and without injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/jessec4.htm | title = Functional training | accessdate = 2007-08-26 | last = Cannone | first = Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of body building, functional training involves mainly [[weight bearing]] activities targeted at core [[muscle]]s of the [[Human abdomen#Muscles of the abdominal wall|abdomen]] and lower [[back]]. Fabio Martella wrote that most fitness facilities have a variety of [[Weight machine|weight training machines]] which target and isolate specific muscles.  As a result, the movements do not necessarily bear any relationship to the movements people make in their regular activities or sports.

In rehabilitation, training does not necessarily have to involve weight bearing activities, but can target any task or a combination of tasks that a patient is having difficulty with. [[Balance (ability)|Balance]] training, for example, is often incorporated into a patient’s treatment plan if it has been impaired after injury or disease.

== Evidence ==
[[Physical therapy|Rehabilitation]] after [[stroke]] has evolved over the past 15 years from conventional treatment techniques to task specific training techniques which involve training of basic functions, skills and endurance (muscular and cardiovascular).&lt;ref name="Timmermans et al. (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Timmermans, A. A |author2=Spooren, A. I. F. |author3=Kingma, H. |author4=Seleen, H. A. M. | year=2010| title=Influence of Task-Oriented Training Content on Skilled Arm–Hand Performance in Stroke: A Systematic Review| journal=Neural rehabilitation and neural repair| volume=24 | pages=219–224 | doi=10.1177/1545968310368963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional training has been well supported in evidenced based research for rehabilitation of this population.&lt;ref name="Timmermans et al. (2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blennerhassett &amp; Dite. (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blennerhassett, J. |author2= Dite, W. |last-author-amp=yes | year=2004| title=Additional task-related practice improves mobility and upper limb function early after stroke: A randomised controlled trial| journal=Australian journal of physiotherapy| volume=50 | pages=858–870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASA&gt;[http://www.ebrsr.com/reviews_details.php?Upper-Extremity-Interventions-31 "Upper extremity interventions"], Evidence-based review of stroke rehabilitation&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that task specific training yields long-lasting cortical reorganization which is specific to the areas of the brain being used with each task.&lt;ref name=ASA/&gt; Studies have also shown that patients make larger gains in functional tasks used in their rehabilitation and since they are more likely to continue practicing these tasks in everyday living, better results during follow-up are obtained.&lt;ref name="Timmermans et al. (2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blennerhassett &amp; Dite. (2004)"/&gt;

== Equipment ==

Some options include:
{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|
* Clubbells
* Macebells
* [[Cable machine]]s
* [[Barbell]]s
* [[Dumbbell]]s
* [[Medicine ball]]s
* [[Kettlebell]]s
* Bodyweight training
* Physioballs (also called Swiss balls or exercise balls)
* Resistance tubes
* Rocker and wobble boards
* Whole Body Vibration equipment (also called WBV or Acceleration Training)
* Balance disks
* Sandbags
* Suspension system
* Slideboard
* Redcord

}}

In [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] however, equipment is mainly chosen by its relevance to the patient. In many cases equipment needs are minimal and include things that are familiar and useful to the patient.

===Cable machines===
[[Cable machine]]s, also known as pulley machines, are large upright machines, either with a single pulley, or else a pulley attached to both sides.  They allow an athlete to recruit all major muscle groups while moving in multiple planes.  Cable machines also provide a smooth, continuous action which reduces the need for momentum to start repetitions, provide a constant tension on the muscle, peak-contraction is possible at the top of each rep, a safe means of performing [[Muscle contraction#Eccentric contraction|negative repetitions]], and a variety of attachments that allow great flexibility in the exercises performed and body parts targeted.

== Components of a functional exercise program ==
To be effective, a functional exercise program should include a number of different elements which can be adapted to an individual's needs or goals:&lt;ref name="Timmermans et al. (2010)"/&gt;
* Based on functional tasks directed toward everyday life activities. 
* Individualized – a training program should be tailored to each individual. Any program must be specific to the goals of an individual, focusing on meaningful tasks. It must also be specific to the individual state of health, including presence or history of injury. An assessment should be performed to help guide exercise selection and training load.
* Integrated – It should include a variety of exercises that work on flexibility, [[core (anatomy)|core]], balance, strength and power, focusing on multiple movement planes.
* Progressive – Progressive training steadily increases the difficulty of the task.
* Periodized – mainly by training with distributed practice and varying the tasks.
* Repeated frequently.
* Use of real life object manipulation.
* Performed in context-specific environments.
* Feedback should be incorporated following performance (self-feedback of success is used as well as trainer/therapist feedback).

==Health status==

=== Top 10 causes of death in Malawi ===

In 2011, the University of Malawi released an article by Cameron Bowie that listed the following as the top ten causes of death in Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowie|first=Cameron|year=2011|title=Burden of Disease Estimates for 2011 and the potential effects of the Essential Health Package on Malawi's health burden.|publisher=University of Malawi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC in Malawi (Edit)"&gt;{{cite web|title=CDC in Malawi|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/countries/malawi/{{!}}publisher|work=Center for Disease Control|accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# HIV/AIDS (25%)
# [[Lower respiratory infections]] (12%)
# [[Diarrhoeal diseases]] (8%)
# Malaria (8%)
# [[Cerebrovascular disease]] (4%)
# [[Ischemic]] [[Heart Disease]] (4%)
# [[Perinatal]] conditions (3%)
# Tuberculosis (3%)
# Road traffic accidents (2%)
# [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (1%)

=== Life expectancy ===
The 2014 CIA estimated average life expectancy in Malawi was 59.99 years.&lt;ref name=iuonoa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook Life Expectancy|publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fertility rate ===
In 2014 Malawi had a total [[fertility rate]] of 5.26 children born/woman.&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact BOOK"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Fact Book|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mi.html|work=Africa:: Malawi|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infectious diseases ===
There is a high degree of risk for major infectious diseases, including [[bacterial]] and [[protozoal]] [[diarrhea]], [[hepatitis A]], [[typhoid fever]], [[malaria]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]], [[schistosomiasis]] and [[rabies]].&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mi.html|title=Malawi|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===
{{Further information|HIV/AIDS in Malawi}}

In 2013 Malawi had a HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate of 11%.&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact BOOK" /&gt; In 2013 there were 920,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, and 51,000 AIDS related deaths.&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact BOOK" /&gt;

Due to the vast scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV contraction and death from AIDS are inevitable.&lt;ref name=Fifteen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaler|first=Amy|title=AIDS-talk in Everyday Life: The Presence of HIV/AIDS in Men's Informal Conversation in Southern Malawi|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2004|volume=59|issue=2|pages=285–97|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2003.10.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt;

[[File:Feed The Children CBCC P1000182.jpg|thumb|AIDS orphans in Malawi]]
These men sometimes claim that [[unprotected sex]] is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of [[condom usage|condom use]] during sex with extramarital partners.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring to believe that they have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict [[fidelity]].&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.&lt;ref name=Sixteen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalipeni|first=Ezekiel|author2=Jayati Ghosh|title=Concern and practice among men about HIV/AIDS in low socioeconomic income areas of Lilongwe, Malawi|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2007|volume=64|issue=5|pages=1116–1127|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite these widespread feelings of fatalism, some men believe that they can avoid HIV contraction by modifying their personal behaviors.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; Men who decide to change their behaviors to reduce their risk of infection are unlikely to use [[condom usage|condoms]] consistently, particularly during marital intercourse; instead, they usually continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations, but alter the ways in which they choose their sexual partners.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt;

For example, before selecting extramarital sexual partners, men sometimes survey their peers to determine whether their potential partners are likely to have exposed themselves to the virus.&lt;ref name=Twenty-five&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kirsten|author2=Susan Watkins|title=Perceptions of Risk and Strategies for Prevention: Responses to HIV/AIDS in Rural Malawi|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2005|volume=60|pages=649–660|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.06.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men who choose their sexual partners based on external appearances and peer recommendations often believe that women who violate traditional [[gender norms]] by, for example, wearing modern clothing are more likely to carry HIV, while young girls, who are perceived as sexually inexperienced, are considered "pure".&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; Because of this perception, many people are concerned that [[schoolchildren]] in Malawi, particularly girls, are becoming exposed to the virus through sexual harassment or abuse by their instructors.&lt;ref name=Twenty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Claudia|title=The Impact of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic on the Education Sector in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Synthesis of the Findings and Recommendations of Three Country Studies (review)|journal=Transformation: Critical Perspectives on Southern Africa|year=2004|volume=54|issue=1|pages=160–63|doi=10.1353/trn.2004.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health indicators===
The CIA [[World Fact Book]]'s "country comparison to the world" ranking indicates how Malawi's [[health indicators]] compare to other countries in the world. Since the first case of [[HIV/AIDS in Malawi]] in 1985, HIV/AIDS has drastically affected Malawi's health indicators.
Malawi's rankings:&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact BOOK" /&gt;

=== Endemic diseases ===

==== Malaria ====
Malaria affects numerous aspects of social and economic life in Malawi.  High malaria prevalence affects fertility, savings and investment rates, crop choices, schooling and migration decisions.&lt;ref name="Economic and social burden of Malaria" /&gt;  There are a wide variety of cost-effective approaches to reduce the burden of malaria.  Some current intervention tactics include [[Medical case management|case management]], the use of insecticide-treated [[bed nets]], indoor residual spraying, and environmental [[vector control]] measures such as larvaciding (controlling mosquitoes at the larval stage through the use of chemicals) and filling and draining of breeding sites.&lt;ref name="Cost-effectiveness of malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodman|first=C.A. |author2=P.G. Coleman |author3=A.J. Mills|title=Cost-effectiveness of malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa|journal=Lancet|year=1999|volume=354|pages= 378–385|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(99)02141-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Each of these interventions has proven to have a high value of health gains achieved per dollar.&lt;ref name="Economic and social burden of Malaria" /&gt;  More specifically, mosquito nets are one of the most effective and widely used approaches. They are most effective in that they require a minimal amount of resource input and result in a large decrease in the prevalence of Malaria.&lt;ref name="Malaria and Protective Behaviours: Is There a Malaria Trap?" /&gt;

In their article titled "The Economic and Social Burden of Malaria", Pia Malaney and Jeffrey Sachs present an argument for the prominent [[social theory]] regarding the intimate relationship between [[disease prevalence]] and poverty.

A comparison of income in malarious and non-malarious countries indicates that average GDP (adjusted to give [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP)) in malarious countries in 1995 was US$1,526, compared with US$8,268 in countries without intensive malaria – more than a fivefold difference.&lt;ref name="The Economic Burden of Malaria"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallup|first=J|author2=J.

[[File:World Health Organisation building from west.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of the [[World Health Organization]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].]]

'''Health policy''' can be defined as the "decisions, plans, and actions that are undertaken to achieve specific [[healthcare]] goals within a society".&lt;ref name="WHO-HP"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/health_policy/en/ ''Health Policy''], accessed 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]], an explicit health policy can achieve several things: it defines a vision for the future; it outlines priorities and the expected roles of different groups; and it builds consensus and informs people.&lt;ref name="WHO-HP"/&gt;

There are many categories of health policies, including global health policy, public health policy, mental health policy, health care services policy, [[insurance policy]], personal healthcare policy, [[pharmaceutical policy]], and policies related to [[public health]] such as [[vaccination policy]], [[Tobacco smoking#Public policy|tobacco control policy]] or [[breastfeeding promotion]] policy. They may cover topics of financing and delivery of healthcare, access to care, quality of care, and [[HealthEquity|health equity.]]&lt;ref&gt;Harvard School of Public Health, Department of Health Policy and Management [http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/about ''About Health Care Policy''], accessed 25 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Health-related policy and its implementation is complex. Conceptual models can help show the flow from health-related policy development to health-related policy and program implementation and to [[health system]]s and health outcomes. Policy should be understood as more than a national law or health policy that supports a program or intervention. Operational policies are the rules, regulations, guidelines, and administrative norms that governments use to translate national laws and policies into programs and services.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, H, N Jewell and Karen Hardee.  2001. [http://www.policyproject.com/pubs/occasional/op-7.pdf ''Reforming Operational Policies:  A Pathway to Improving Reproductive Health Programs''] POLICY Occasional Paper. No. 7.  Washington DC: The Futures Group International, POLICY Project&lt;/ref&gt; The policy process encompasses decisions made at a national or decentralized level (including funding decisions) that affect whether and how services are delivered. Thus, attention must be paid to policies at multiple levels of the health system and over time to ensure sustainable scale-up. A supportive policy environment will facilitate the scale-up of health interventions.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hardee, L. Ashford, E. Rottach, R. Jolivet, and R. Kiesel. 2012. [http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/index.cfm?ID=publications&amp;get=pubID&amp;pubID=83 ''The Policy Dimensions of Scaling Up Health Initiatives'']. Washington, DC: Futures Group, Health Policy Project&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many topics in the [[politics]] and [[evidence]] that can influence the decision of a government, private sector business or other group to adopt a specific policy. [[Evidence-based policy]] relies on the use of science and rigorous studies such as [[randomized controlled trial]]s to identify programs and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes. Most political debates surround personal health care policies, especially those that seek to [[health care reform|reform healthcare delivery]], and can typically be categorized as either [[philosophy|philosophical]] or [[economics|economic]]. Philosophical debates center around questions about [[individual rights]], ethics and government authority, while economic topics include how to maximize the efficiency of health care delivery and minimize costs.

The modern concept of healthcare involves access to [[health care provider|medical professionals]] from various fields as well as [[medical technology]], such as [[medication]]s and [[surgical instrument|surgical equipment]]. It also involves access to the latest information and evidence from research, including [[medical research]] and [[health services research]].

In many countries it is left to the individual to gain access to healthcare goods and services by paying for them directly as [[out-of-pocket expenses]], and to private sector players in the medical and [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] industries to develop research. Planning and production of [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] is distributed among labour market participants.

Other countries have an explicit policy to ensure and support access for all of its citizens, to fund health research, and to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of health workers to meet healthcare goals. Many governments around the world have established [[universal health care]], which takes the burden of healthcare expenses off of private businesses or individuals through pooling of financial risk.  There are a variety of arguments for and against universal healthcare and related health policies. Healthcare is an important part of [[health systems]] and therefore it often accounts for one of the largest areas of spending for both [[government]]s and individuals all over the world.

== Personal healthcare policy options ==

=== Philosophy: right to health ===
{{See also|Philosophy of healthcare}}

Many countries and jurisdictions integrate a [[human rights]] philosophy in directing their healthcare policies. The [[World Health Organization]] reports that every country in the world is party to at least one human rights [[treaty]] that addresses health-related rights, including the [[right to health]] as well as other rights that relate to conditions necessary for good health.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/hhr/en/ ''Health and Human Rights''.] Geneva. Accessed 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]]' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) asserts that medical care is a right of all people:&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml ''The Universal Declaration of Human Rights''.] Adopted on December 10, 1948 by the General Assembly of the United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[UDHR]] Article 25:'' "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, illness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control."

In some jurisdictions and among different [[faith-based organizations]], health policies are influenced by the perceived obligation shaped by religious beliefs to care for those in less favorable circumstances, including the sick. Other jurisdictions and [[non-governmental organization]]s draw on the principles of [[humanism]] in defining their health policies, asserting the same perceived obligation and enshrined [[right to health]].&lt;ref name="NHCHC"&gt;National Health Care for the Homeless Council.[http://www.nhchc.org/humanright.html "Human Rights, Homelessness and Health Care."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610180442/http://www.nhchc.org/humanright.html |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CESR"&gt;Center for Economic and Social Rights. [http://cesr.org/ushealthright "The Right to Health in the United States of America: What Does it Mean?"] October 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the worldwide human rights organization [[Amnesty International]] has focused on [[health]] as a human right, addressing inadequate access to [[HIV]] drugs and women's [[reproductive health|sexual and reproductive]] rights including wide disparities in [[maternal mortality]] within and across countries. Such increasing attention to health as a basic human right has been welcomed by the leading medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = The Lancet | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60768-X | title = Half a century of Amnesty International | journal = The Lancet | volume = 377 | issue = 9780 | pages = 1808 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21621708 | pmc = | url    =  http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(11)60768-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There remains considerable controversy regarding policies on who would be paying the costs of medical care for all people and under what circumstances. For example, government spending on healthcare is sometimes used as a global indicator of a government's commitment to the health of its people.&lt;ref name="LANCET"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lu | first1 = C. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = M. T. | last3 = Gubbins | first3 = P. | last4 = Leach-Kemon | first4 = K. | last5 = Jamison | first5 = D. | last6 = Murray | first6 = C. J. | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60233-4 | title = Public financing of health in developing countries: A cross-national systematic analysis | journal = The Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9723 | pages = 1375–1387 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20381856 | pmc = | url    = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(10)60233-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, one school of thought emerging from the United States rejects the notion of health care financing through taxpayer funding as incompatible with the (considered no less important) right of the physician's professional judgment, and the related concerns that government involvement in overseeing the health of its citizens could erode the [[right to privacy]] between doctors and patients. The argument furthers that universal health insurance denies the right of individual patients to dispose of their own income as per their own will.&lt;ref name="Sade"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sade | first1 = R. M. | title = Medical Care as a Right: A Refutation | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197112022852304 | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 285 | issue = 23 | pages = 1288–1292 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5113728 | pmc = }} (Reprinted as [http://www.aapsonline.org/brochures/sademcr.htm "The Political Fallacy that Medical Care is a Right."])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cato Institute. [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3057 ''Universal Health Care Won't Work – Witness Medicare.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue in the rights debate is governments' use of legislation to control competition among private medical insurance providers against national [[social insurance]] systems, such as the case in [[Canada's national health insurance program]]. [[Laissez-faire]] supporters argue that this erodes the [[cost-effectiveness]] of the health system, as even those who can afford to pay for private healthcare services drain resources from the public system.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner MD. [http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/08/23/revolt-against-canadian-health-care-system-continues/ ''Revolt Against Canadian Health Care System Continues''.] "Cato-at-liberty" – The Cato Institute, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue here is whether investor-owned medical insurance companies or [[health maintenance organization]]s are in a better position to act in the best interests of their customers compared to government regulation and oversight. Another claim in the United States perceives government over-regulation of the healthcare and insurance industries as the effective end of charitable home visits from doctors among the poor and elderly.&lt;ref name="David E. Kelley"&gt;David E. Kelley, "A Life of One's Own: Individual Rights and the Welfare State." [[Cato Institute]], October 1998, {{ISBN|1-882577-70-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics: healthcare financing===
Many types of health policies exist focusing on the financing of healthcare services to spread the economic risks of ill health. These include [[publicly funded health care]] (through taxation or insurance, also known as single-payer systems), mandatory or voluntary private [[health insurance]], and complete [[rights issue|capitalization]] of personal health care services through private companies, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kereiakes | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Willerson | first2 = J. T. | title = US Health Care: Entitlement or Privilege? | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.0000124795.36864.78 | journal = Circulation | volume = 109 | issue = 12 | pages = 1460–1462 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15051650 | pmc = |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/109/12/1460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/health_financing/en/ ''Health financing policy''.] Geneva. Accessed 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is ongoing on which type of health financing policy results in better or worse quality of healthcare services provided, and how to ensure allocated funds are used effectively, efficiently and [[health equity|equitably]].

There are many arguments on both sides of the issue of public versus private health financing policies:

'''''Claims that publicly funded healthcare improves the quality and efficiency of personal health care delivery:'''''
* Government spending on health is essential for the accessibility and sustainability of healthcare services and programmes.&lt;ref name="LANCET"/&gt;
* For those people who would otherwise go without care due to lack of financial means, any quality care is an improvement.
* Since people perceive universal healthcare as ''free'' (if there is no insurance premium or co-payment), they are more likely to seek [[preventive care]] which may reduce the disease burden and overall healthcare costs in the long run.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
* Single-payer systems reduce wastefulness by removing the middle man, i.e. private insurance companies, thus reducing the amount of bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;William F May. [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=106 "The Ethical Foundations of Health Care Reform."] ''The Christian Century'', June 1–8, 1994, pp. 572–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, reducing the amount of paperwork that medical professionals have to deal with for insurance claims processing allows them to concentrate more on treating [[patient]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

'''''Claims that privately funded healthcare leads to greater quality and efficiencies in personal health care:'''''
* Perceptions that publicly funded healthcare is ''free'' can lead to overuse of medical services, and hence raise overall costs compared to private health financing.&lt;ref&gt;
Heritage Foundation News Release, [http://www.heritage.org/Press/NewsReleases/NR092900.cfm "British, Canadian Experience Shows Folly of Socialized Medicine, Analyst Says."] Sept. 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Gratzer"&gt;Heritage Foundation News Release,[http://www.heritage.org/Research/HealthCare/hl982.cfm "The Cure: How Capitalism Can Save American Health Care."] December 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Privately funded medicine leads to greater quality and efficiencies through increased access to and reduced waiting times for specialized health care services and technologies.&lt;ref name="Sade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;Goodman, John. [http://www.cato.org/pubs/catosletter/catosletterv3n1.pdf "Five Myths of Socialized Medicine."] Cato Institute: ''Cato's Letter''. Winter, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;Friedmen, David. ''The Machinery of Freedom.'' Arlington House Publishers: New York, 1978. pp. 65–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Limiting the allocation of public funds for personal healthcare does not curtail the ability of uninsured citizens to pay for their healthcare as [[out-of-pocket expenses]]. Public funds can be better rationalized to provide [[emergency care]] services regardless of insured status or ability to pay, such as with the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
* Privately funded and operated healthcare reduces the requirement for governments to increase taxes to cover healthcare costs, which may be compounded by the inefficiencies among government agencies due to their greater bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cato Institute.  [http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb109/hb_109-7.pdf ''Cato Handbook on Policy, 6th Edition'' – Chapter 7: "Health Care."] Washington, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other health policy options ==
Health policy options extend beyond the financing and delivery of personal health care, to domains such as [[medical research]] and [[health workforce]] planning, both domestically and internationally.

=== Medical research policy ===
[[Medical research]] can be both the basis for defining evidence-based health policy, and the subject of health policy itself, particularly in terms of its sources of funding. Those in favor of government policies for publicly funded medical research posit that removing profit as a motive will increase the rate of medical [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, the recent discovery that dichloroacetate (DCA) can cause regression in several cancers, including lung, breast and brain tumors.[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/01/17/cancer-chemo.html Alberta scientists test chemotherapy alternative Last Updated: Wednesday, January 17, 2007]  The DCA compound is not patented or owned by any pharmaceutical company, and, therefore, would likely be an inexpensive drug to administer, Michelakis added.  The bad news, is that while DCA is not patented, Michelakis is concerned that it may be difficult to find funding from private investors to test DCA in clinical trials.[http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=8153 University of Alberta – Small molecule offers big hope against cancer. January 16, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227080213/http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=8153 |date=February 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those opposed argue that it will do the opposite, because removing the incentive of profit removes incentives to innovate and inhibits new technologies from being developed and utilized.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Miller RL |author2=DK Benjamin |author3=DC North |title=The Economics of Public Issues |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2003 |isbn=0321118731 |edition=13th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of sound medical research does not necessarily lead to evidence-based policymaking. For example, in South Africa, whose population sets the record for [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|HIV infections]], previous government policy limiting funding and access for AIDS treatments met with strong controversy given its basis on a refusal to accept scientific evidence on the means of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm "Controversy dogs Aids forum."] ''BBC News'', 10 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A change of government eventually led to a change in policy, with new policies implemented for widespread access to HIV services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/aidssouthafrica.htm "HIV and AIDS in South Africa."] ''Avert''. Accessed 23 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue relates to [[intellectual property]], as illustrated by the case of Brazil, where debates have arisen over government policy authorizing the domestic manufacture of [[antiretroviral drug]]s used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS in violation of [[HIV/AIDS in Brazil#Drug patents|drug patents]].

=== Health workforce policy ===
{{Main|Health workforce}}
Some countries and jurisdictions have an explicit policy or strategy to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] to meet healthcare goals, such as to address [[physician supply|physician]] and [[nursing shortage]]s. Elsewhere, workforce planning is distributed among labour market participants as a [[laissez-faire]] approach to health policy. Evidence-based policies for workforce development are typically based on findings from [[health services research]].

=== Health in foreign policy ===
Many governments and agencies include a health dimension in their [[foreign policy]] in order to achieve [[global health]] goals. Promoting health in lower income countries has been seen as instrumental to achieve other goals on the global agenda, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kickbusch | first1 = I. | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d3154 | title = Global health diplomacy: How foreign policy can influence health | journal = BMJ | volume = 342 | pages = d3154 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21665931 | pmc = |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21665931}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promoting [[global security]] – linked to fears of global [[pandemic]]s, the intentional spread of [[pathogen]]s, and a potential increase in humanitarian conflicts, natural disasters, and emergencies;
* Promoting [[economic development]] – including addressing the economic effect of poor health on development, of pandemic outbreaks on the global market place, and also the gain from the growing global market in health goods and services;
* Promoting [[social justice]] – reinforcing health as a social value and human right, including supporting the United Nations' [[Millennium Development Goals]].

=== Global health policy ===
Global health policy encompasses the global governance structures that create the policies underlying public health throughout the world. In addressing [[global health]], global health policy "implies consideration of the health needs of the people of the whole planet above the concerns of particular nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = T. M. | last2 = Cueto | first2 = M. | last3 = Fee | first3 = E. | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2004.050831 | title = The World Health Organization and the Transition from "International" to "Global" Public Health | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 62–72 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16322464 | pmc =1470434 | url=http://www.ajph.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2004.050831?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Distinguished from both international health policy (agreements among sovereign states) and comparative health policy (analysis of health policy across states), global health policy institutions consist of the actors and norms that frame the global health response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Szlezák | first1 = N.

The '''impact of [[nanotechnology]]''' extends from its [[Nanomedicine|medical]], [[ethical]], [[mind|mental]], legal and [[Environmental science|environmental]] applications, to fields such as engineering, biology, chemistry, computing, materials science, and communications.

Major benefits of nanotechnology include improved manufacturing methods, water purification systems, energy systems, [[Human enhancement|physical enhancement]], [[nanomedicine]], better food production methods, nutrition and large-scale infrastructure auto-fabrication.&lt;ref name="nni"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nano.gov/about-nni | title=About the National Nanotechnology Initiative | publisher=United States National Nanotechnology Initiative | date=2016 | accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanotechnology's reduced size may allow for automation of tasks which were previously inaccessible due to physical restrictions, which in turn may reduce labor, land, or maintenance requirements placed on humans.

Potential risks include environmental, health, and safety issues; transitional effects such as displacement of traditional industries as the products of nanotechnology become dominant, which are of concern to privacy rights advocates. These may be particularly important if potential negative effects of nanoparticles are overlooked.

Whether [[nanotechnology]] merits special government [[regulation]] is a controversial issue. Regulatory bodies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission have started dealing with the potential risks of nanoparticles. The organic food sector has been the first to act with the regulated exclusion of engineered nanoparticles from certified organic produce, firstly in [[Australia]] and the [[UK]],&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2010), [http://orgprints.org/16786/1/16786.pdf Nanotechnology: No Free Lunch], Platter, 1(1) 8-17&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently in [[Canada]], as well as for all food certified to [[Demeter International]] standards&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19528/1/Paull2011NanoISOFAR.pdf  "Nanomaterials in food and agriculture: The big issue of small matter for organic food and farming"], In: Neuhoff, Daniel; Halberg, Niels; Rasmussen, I.A.; Hermansen, J.E.; Ssekyewa, Charles and Sohn, Sang Mok (Eds.)

==Overview==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}

The presence of nanomaterials (materials that contain [[nanoparticle]]s) is not in itself a threat. It is only certain aspects that can make them risky, in particular their mobility and their increased reactivity. Only if certain properties of certain nanoparticles were harmful to living beings or the environment would we be faced with a genuine hazard. In this case it can be called nanopollution.

In addressing the health and environmental impact of nanomaterials we need to differentiate between two types of nanostructures:  (1) Nanocomposites, nanostructured surfaces and nanocomponents (electronic, optical, sensors etc.), where nanoscale particles are incorporated into a substance, material or device (“fixed” nano-particles); and (2) “free” nanoparticles, where at some stage in production or use individual nanoparticles of a substance are present. These free nanoparticles could be nanoscale species of elements, or simple compounds, but also complex compounds where for instance a nanoparticle of a particular element is coated with another substance (“coated” nanoparticle or “core-shell” nanoparticle).

There seems to be consensus that, although one should be aware of materials containing fixed nanoparticles, the immediate concern is with free nanoparticles.

Nanoparticles are very different from their everyday counterparts, so their adverse effects cannot be derived from the known toxicity of the macro-sized material. This poses significant issues for addressing the health and environmental impact of free nanoparticles.

To complicate things further, in talking about nanoparticles it is important that a powder or liquid containing nanoparticles almost never be monodisperse, but contain instead a range of particle sizes. This complicates the experimental analysis as larger nanoparticles might have different properties from smaller ones. Also, nanoparticles show a tendency to aggregate, and such aggregates often behave differently from individual nanoparticles.

[[File:NIOSH Nano Research - Engineering Controls for Nanomaterial Production and Handling Processes.webm|thumb|A video on the health and safety implications of nanotechnology]]

The health impacts of [[nanotechnology]] are the possible effects that the use of nanotechnological materials and devices will have on [[human health]].  As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is great debate regarding to what extent nanotechnology will benefit or pose risks for human health.  Nanotechnology's health impacts can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to have [[Nanomedicine|medical applications]] to cure disease, and the potential health hazards posed by exposure to [[nanomaterials]].

===Medical applications===
{{Main|Nanomedicine}}

Nanomedicine is the [[medicine|medical]] application of [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref name=Nanomed1&gt;[http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI.htm Nanomedicine, Volume I: Basic Capabilities], by Robert A. Freitas Jr. 1999, {{ISBN|1-57059-645-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approaches to nanomedicine range from the medical use of [[nanomaterials]], to [[Nanoelectronics|nanoelectronic]] biosensors, and even possible future applications of [[molecular nanotechnology]].  Nanomedicine seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically helpful devices in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wagner V, Dullaart A, Bock AK, Zweck A |title=The emerging nanomedicine landscape |journal= Nat. Biotechnol. |volume=24|issue=10|pages=1211–1217|year=2006 |doi=10.1038/nbt1006-1211 |pmid=17033654 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Freitas RA Jr. |title=What is Nanomedicine?|journal= Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine |volume=1|issue=1|pages=2–9|year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.nano.2004.11.003 |pmid=17292052 |url=http://www.nanomedicine.com/Papers/WhatIsNMMar05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]] expects new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems, new therapies, and [[in vivo]] imaging.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/2884490809 Nanotechnology in Medicine and the Biosciences], by Coombs RRH, Robinson DW. 1996, {{ISBN|2-88449-080-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuro-electronic interfaces and other [[nanoelectronics]]-based sensors are another active goal of research.  Further down the line, the [[Futures studies|speculative]] field of [[molecular nanotechnology]] believes that [[Nanorobotics|cell repair machines]] could revolutionize medicine and the medical field.

Nanomedicine research is directly funded, with the US [[National Institutes of Health]] in 2005 funding a five-year plan to set up four nanomedicine centers. In April 2006, the journal [[Nature Materials]] estimated that 130 nanotech-based drugs and delivery systems were being developed worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Editorial. |title=Nanomedicine: A matter of rhetoric? |journal= Nat Mater |volume=5|issue=4|pages=243|year=2006 |doi=10.1038/nmat1625 |pmid=16582920 |url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v5/n4/full/nmat1625.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nanomedicine is a large industry, with nanomedicine sales reaching $6.8 billion in 2004. With over 200 companies and 38 products worldwide, a minimum of $3.8 billion in nanotechnology [[research and development|R&amp;D]] is being invested every year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131014005 Nanotechnology: A Gentle Introduction to the Next Big Idea], by MA Ratner, D Ratner. 2002, {{ISBN|0-13-101400-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the nanomedicine industry continues to grow, it is expected to have a significant impact on the economy.

===Health hazards===
{{Main|Nanotoxicology}}

Nanotoxicology is the field which studies potential health risks of nanomaterials.  The extremely small size of nanomaterials means that they are much more readily taken up by the human body than larger sized particles.  How these nanoparticles behave inside the organism is one of the significant issues that needs to be resolved. The behavior of nanoparticles is a function of their size, shape and surface reactivity with the surrounding tissue. Apart from what happens if non-degradable or slowly degradable nanoparticles accumulate in organs, another concern is their potential interaction with biological processes inside the body: because of their large surface, nanoparticles on exposure to tissue and fluids will immediately [[Adsorption|adsorb]] onto their surface some of the macromolecules they encounter.  The large number of variables influencing toxicity means that it is difficult to generalise about health risks associated with exposure to nanomaterials – each new nanomaterial must be assessed individually and all material properties must be taken into account.  Health and environmental issues combine in the workplace of companies engaged in producing or using nanomaterials and in the laboratories engaged in nanoscience and nanotechnology research. It is safe to say that current workplace exposure standards for dusts cannot be applied directly to nanoparticle dusts.

The extremely small size of nanomaterials also means that they are much more readily taken up by the human body than larger sized particles.  How these nanoparticles behave inside the body is one of the issues that needs to be resolved. The behavior of nanoparticles is a function of their size, shape and surface reactivity with the surrounding tissue. They could cause overload on [[phagocyte]]s, cells that ingest and destroy foreign matter, thereby triggering stress reactions that lead to inflammation and weaken the body’s defense against other pathogens. Apart from what happens if non-degradable or slowly degradable nanoparticles accumulate in organs, another concern is their potential interaction with biological processes inside the body: because of their large surface, nanoparticles on exposure to tissue and fluids will immediately [[Adsorption|adsorb]] onto their surface some of the macromolecules they encounter. This may, for instance, affect the regulatory mechanisms of enzymes and other proteins.

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] has conducted initial research on how nanoparticles interact with the body’s systems and how workers might be exposed to nano-sized particles in the manufacturing or industrial use of nanomaterials. NIOSH currently offers interim guidelines for working with nanomaterials consistent with the best scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-160/pdfs/2011-160.pdf|title=Current Intelligence Bulletin 63: Occupational Exposure to Titanium Dioxide|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory]] of NIOSH, studies investigating the filter penetration of nanoparticles on NIOSH-certified and EU marked [[respirator]]s, as well as non-certified [[dust mask]]s have been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2011/12/resp-nano/|title=CDC - NIOSH Science Blog - Respiratory Protection for Workers Handling Engineering Nanoparticles|date=December 7, 2011|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|vauthors=Zhuang Z, Viscusi D|accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies found that the most penetrating [[particle size]] range was between 30 and 100 nanometers, and leak size was the largest factor in the number of nanoparticles found inside the respirators of the test dummies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Respiratory protection against airborne nanoparticles: a review|journal=J Nanopart Res|volume=11|pages=1661–1672|doi=10.1007/s11051-009-9649-3|vauthors=Shaffer RE, Rengasamy S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Total inward leakage of nanoparticles through filtering facepiece respirators|journal=Ann Occup Hyg|volume=55|pages=253–263|doi=10.1093/annhyg/meq096|vauthors=Rengasamy S, Eimer BC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other properties of nanomaterials that influence toxicity include: chemical composition, shape, surface structure, surface charge, aggregation and solubility,&lt;ref name="SciMag"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=3 February 2006 |volume=311 |issue=5761 |pages=622–627 |title=Toxic Potential of Materials at the Nanolevel |first=Andre |last=Nel |doi=10.1126/science.1114397 |pmid=16456071|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the presence or absence of [[functional group]]s of other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Nano Letters]] |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=1121–1125 |year=2006 |title=Cellular Toxicity of Carbon-Based Nanomaterials |first=Arnaud |last=Magrez |doi=10.1021/nl060162e |pmid=16771565|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The large number of variables influencing toxicity means that it is difficult to generalise about health risks associated with exposure to nanomaterials – each new nanomaterial must be assessed individually and all material properties must be taken into account.

Literature reviews have been showing that release of engineered nanoparticles and incurred personal exposure can happen during different work activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ding Y ''et al'' | year = 2016 | title = Airborne engineered nanomaterials in the workplace—a review of release and worker exposure during nanomaterial production and handling processes | url = | journal = J.

==Environmental impact==

The environmental impact of nanotechnology is the possible effects that the use of nanotechnological materials and devices will have on [[environment (biophysical)|the environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26955878|year=2016|author1=Formoso|first1=P|title=Nanotechnology for the Environment and Medicine|journal=Mini Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry|volume=16|issue=8|pages=668–75|last2=Muzzalupo|first2=R|last3=Tavano|first3=L|last4=De Filpo|first4=G|last5=Nicoletta|first5=FP}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is debate regarding to what extent industrial and commercial use of [[nanomaterials]] will affect organisms and ecosystems.

Nanotechnology's environmental impact can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to help improve the environment, and the possibly novel type of pollution that nanotechnological materials might cause if released into the environment.

=== Environmental applications ===
{{main|Green nanotechnology}}Green nanotechnology refers to the use of [[nanotechnology]] to enhance the environmental sustainability of processes producing [[negative externalities]]. It also refers to the use of the products of nanotechnology to enhance [[sustainability]].  It includes making green nano-products and using nano-products in support of sustainability.  Green nanotechnology has been described as the development of [[clean technologies]], "to minimize potential environmental and human health risks associated with the manufacture and use of nanotechnology products, and to encourage replacement of existing products with new nano-products that are more environmentally friendly throughout their [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|lifecycle]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/topics/green/|title=Environment and Green Nano - Topics - Nanotechnology Project|accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green nanotechnology has two goals: producing [[nanomaterials]] and products without harming the environment or human health, and producing nano-products that provide solutions to environmental problems. It uses existing principles of [[green chemistry]] and green engineering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppt/greenengineering/pubs/whats_ge.html What is Green Engineering], US Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/ref&gt; to make nanomaterials and nano-products without toxic ingredients, at low temperatures using less energy and renewable inputs wherever possible, and using lifecycle thinking in all design and engineering stages.

===Pollution===
{{Main article|Nanomaterials pollution}}

Nanopollution is a generic name for all waste generated by [[nanodevice]]s or during the [[nanomaterial]]s manufacturing process. Nanowaste is mainly the group of particles that are released into the environment, or the particles that are thrown away when still on their products.

==Social impact==

{{Main article|Societal impact of nanotechnology}}

Beyond the toxicity risks to human health and the environment which are associated with first-generation nanomaterials, nanotechnology has broader societal impact and poses broader social challenges. Social scientists have suggested that nanotechnology's social issues should be understood and assessed not simply as "downstream" risks or impacts.  Rather, the challenges should be factored into "upstream" research and decision-making in order to ensure technology development that meets social objectives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Kearnes| first =Matthew| last2 =Grove-White| first2 =Robin| last3 =Macnaghten|first3 =Phil|last4 =Wilsdon|first4 =James|last5 =Wynne|first5=Brian

Many social scientists and organizations in civil society suggest that [[technology assessment]] and governance should also involve public participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macnaghten|first=Phil, et al.|date=December 2005|title=Nanotechnology, Governance, and Public Deliberation: What Role for the Social Sciences?|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042010/http://csec.lancs.ac.uk/docs/nano%20project%20sci%20com%20proofs%20nov05.pdf|journal=Science Communication|volume=27, no, 2|pages=|via=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nanolabweb.com/index.cfm/action/main.default.viewArticle/articleID/135/CFID/60255/CFTOKEN/45212442/|title=Reflecting Upon the UK’s Citizens’ Jury on Nanotechnologies: NanoJury UK|last=Rogers-Hayden|first=Tee|last2=Pidgeon|first2=Nick|date=|website=Nanotechnology Law &amp; Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmin.ac.uk/sshl/pdf/CSDBUlletinMohr.pdf|title=University of Westminster, London|author=|date=|website=www.wmin.ac.uk|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale Demos | Publications | Governing at the Nanoscale&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214083000/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale |date=December 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over 800 nano-related patents were granted in 2003, with numbers increasing to nearly 19,000 internationally by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-patents-nanotechnology-idUSBRE91D0YL20130214 | title=U.S.-based inventors lead world in nanotechnology patents: study | publisher=Reuters | work=Technology | date=14 February 2013 | accessdate=4 June 2016 | author=Smith, Erin Geiger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are already taking out broad-ranging patents on nanoscale discoveries and inventions. For example, two corporations, [[NEC]] and [[IBM]], hold the basic patents on [[carbon nanotube]]s, one of the current cornerstones of nanotechnology. Carbon nanotubes have a wide range of uses, and look set to become crucial to several industries from electronics and computers, to strengthened materials to drug delivery and diagnostics. Carbon nanotubes are poised to become a major traded commodity with the potential to replace major conventional raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3257910/The-end-silicon-IBM-reveals-carbon-nanotube-breakthrough-revolutionise-computing-lead-ultrafast-Artificial-Intelligence-brain-chips.html | title=The end of silicon?

Nanotechnologies may provide new solutions for the millions of people in [[developing countries]] who lack access to basic services, such as safe water, reliable energy, health care, and education.  The 2004 [[United Nations|UN]] Task Force on Science, Technology and Innovation noted that some of the advantages of nanotechnology include production using little labor, land, or maintenance, high productivity, low cost, and modest requirements for materials and energy.  However, concerns are frequently raised that the claimed benefits of nanotechnology will not be evenly distributed, and that any benefits (including technical and/or economic) associated with nanotechnology will only reach affluent nations.&lt;ref name="South"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Invernizzi N, Foladori G, Maclurcan D |title=Nanotechnology's Controversial Role for the South |journal=Science Technology and Society |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=123–148 |year= 2008 |doi=10.1177/097172180701300105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longer-term concerns center on the impact that new technologies will have for society at large, and whether these could possibly lead to either a [[post scarcity|post-scarcity]] economy, or alternatively exacerbate the wealth gap between developed and developing nations. The effects of nanotechnology on the society as a whole, on human health and the environment, on trade, on security, on food systems and even on the definition of "human", have not been characterized or politicized.

== Regulation ==
{{Main article|Regulation of nanotechnology}}

Significant debate exists relating to the question of whether [[nanotechnology]] or nanotechnology-based [[List of nanotechnology applications|products]] merit special government [[regulation]].  This debate is related to the circumstances in which it is necessary and appropriate to assess new substances prior to their release into the market, community and environment.

Regulatory bodies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] in the U.S. or the Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission have started dealing with the potential risks posed by nanoparticles. So far, neither engineered nanoparticles nor the products and materials that contain them are subject to any special regulation regarding production, handling or labelling. The [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] that must be issued for some materials often does not differentiate between bulk and nanoscale size of the material in question and even when it does these MSDS are advisory only.

Limited nanotechnology labeling and regulation may exacerbate potential human and environmental health and safety issues associated with nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=A Small Matter of Regulation: An International Review of Nanotechnology Regulation|journal=Columbia Science and Technology Law Review|volume=8|pages=1–32|vauthors=Bowman D, Hodge G}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the development of comprehensive regulation of nanotechnology will be vital to ensure that the potential risks associated with the research and commercial application of nanotechnology do not overshadow its potential benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=Too Small for Concern? Public Health and Nanotechnology|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|volume=31|issue=4|pages=382–384|doi=10.1111/j.1753-6405.2007.00092.x|pmid=17725022|author1=Bowman D|author2=Fitzharris, M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation may also be required to meet community expectations about responsible development of nanotechnology, as well as ensuring that public interests are included in shaping the development of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Nanotechnology: Mapping the Wild Regulatory Frontier|journal=Futures|volume=38|issue=9|pages=1060–1073|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2006.02.017|vauthors=Bowman D, Hodge G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Consumer Product Safety Commission and Nanotechnology," E. Marla Felcher suggests that the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|Consumer Product Safety Commission]], which is charged with protecting the public against unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with consumer products, is ill-equipped to oversee the safety of complex, high-tech products made using nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;Felcher, EM. (2008). [http://www.nanotechproject.org/publications/archive/pen14/ The Consumer Product Safety Commission and Nanotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13225">The '''Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs''' (IWGYP, or Working Group) is a group within the [[executive branch]] of the [[U.S. government]], and is responsible for promoting healthy outcomes for all youth, including disconnected youth and youth who are at-risk.  The Working Group also engages with national, state, local and tribal agencies and organizations, schools, and faith-based and community organizations that serve youth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findyouthinfo.gov/AboutUs.aspx Overview of the Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs, December 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership of the Working Group includes staff from 18 federal departments and agencies that support programs and services that target youth.  The Working Group was formally established by [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 13459, ''Improving the Coordination and Effectiveness of Youth Programs'', on February 7, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Executive Order 13459: ''Improving the Coordination and Effectiveness of Youth Programs'', available at https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/02/20080207-15.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Working Group has developed a Federal Interagency Website on Youth: [http://youth.gov '''Youth.gov'''].  This website houses federally developed tools and resources, as well as resources submitted by those working in the field, to help youth-serving organizations and community partnerships as they work to promote positive youth outcomes.

== An Overview of the Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs ==

The IWGYP is responsible for promoting achievement of positive outcomes for youth through the following key activities:

*Create and Support Youth.gov - This federal  website provides interactive tools and other resources to help youth-serving organizations and community partnerships plan, implement, and participate in effective programs for youth.
*Create and Support YE4C.gov - This site is the home of the IWGYP’s online youth engagement efforts. YE4C helps young people between the ages of 16 and 24 engage in change on personal, community, and national levels.
*Identify and Disseminate Promising and Effective Strategies - The IWGYP identifies strategies, tools, and resources accessible through Youth.gov that will help promote effective community-based efforts addressing youth risk and protective factors. The Program Directory, a searchable database on Youth.gov, provides visitors with information about such efforts. Communities can determine whether replicating these strategies will meet their needs.
*Promote Enhanced Collaboration – The IWGYP identifies and engages key government, private, and nonprofit organizations that can play a role in improving the coordination and effectiveness of programs serving and appealing to youth. Entities include faith-based and other organizations, community coalitions and partnerships, businesses, volunteers, and other key constituencies. These partnerships and collaborations provide mechanisms to obtain feedback on how federal initiatives are translated at the local level; keep organizations informed about federal funding opportunities; and provide the IWGYP with communication mechanisms to reach regional, state, and local programs.

In addition, the IWGYP is responsible for preparing a strategic plan for federal youth policy (Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 Committee Print of the House Committee on Appropriations on H.R. 1105/Public Law 111-8, Division F). The current draft plan, ''Pathways for Youth: Draft Strategic Plan for Federal Collaboration'', serves as a strengths-based vision for youth that acknowledges the importance of pathways to opportunity for youth that include meaningful connections and safe, healthy, and stable places to live, learn, and work.&lt;br /&gt;
 
The plan includes three main goals, with corresponding objectives, as well as cross-cutting initiatives that will move the plan forward. The three goals of Pathways for Youth are to:
*Promote coordinated strategies to improve youth outcomes;
*Promote the use of evidence-based and innovative strategies at the federal, state, local, and tribal levels; and
*Promote youth engagement and partnerships to strengthen programs and benefit youth.

== Membership ==

Membership of the Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs includes staff from twelve Federal agencies that support programs and services that target youth: 
*[[U.S. Department of Agriculture]];
*[[U.S. Department of Commerce]];
*[[U.S. Department of Defense]];
*[[U.S. Department of Education]];
*[[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (Chair);
*[[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]];
*[[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]];
*[[U.S. Department of Justice]] (Vice-Chair);
*[[U.S. Department of Labor]];
*[[U.S. Department of State]];
*[[U.S. Department of the Interior]];
*[[U.S. Department of Transportation]];
*[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]];
*U.S. [[Social Security Administration]];
*[[U.S. Small Business Administration]];
*The [[Corporation for National and Community Service]]; and
*[[National Science Foundation]];
*The [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]].

The Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs was formally established by Executive Order 13459, ''Improving the Coordination and Effectiveness of Youth Programs'', on February 7, 2008.

== A Federal Website on Youth:  Youth.gov ==

The Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs has developed a Federal Interagency Website on Youth ([http://youth.gov '''Youth.gov''']), which houses federally developed tools and resources, as well as resources submitted by those working in the field, to help youth-serving organizations and community partnerships. Youth.gov seeks to benefit federal agencies, youth service providers, and the youth-serving community. The tools and resources available on the website include resources to assist communities and others with:
*Key elements of effective partnerships, including strategies for engaging youth;
*Helpful community assessment tools;
*Mapping tools that generate maps of local and federal youth programs;
*Searchable database of evidence-based programs to address risk and protective factors in youth;
*High-quality federal publications and web links on youth issues; and
*Youth Topics, which present information on cross-cutting youth topics, federal programs related to this topic that support youth, and shortcuts to maps to find federal programs that address these youth topics.

Topics include:
*Preventing youth violence;
*Mentoring;
*Transition-age youth; 
*Positive youth development;
*Afterschool programs;
*Children of incarcerated parents;
*Youth mental health;
*Preventing gang involvement;
*Youth disaster preparedness;
*Runaway and homeless youth;
*Substance abuse;
*LGBT youth;
*Reconnecting youth;
*Teen pregnancy prevention;
*Juvenile justice;
*Youth employment;
*Teen driver safety;
*Teen dating violence;
*Civic engagement;
*Service learning; and
*Bullying.

== Promoting High Standards for Assessing Program Results ==

The Working Group seeks to develop additional strategies, tools, and resources accessible through the Youth.gov that can help promote effective community-based efforts that address youth risk and protective factors.

The Youth.gov Program Directory is a searchable database that provides users with information about evidence-based programs whose purpose is to prevent and/or reduce problem behaviors in young people (under age 18). Communities can use this tool to determine whether replicating these strategies will meet local needs.

Two sets of programs are included:

1. The [https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/prevention/index.html Teen Pregnancy Prevention] program directory. Under a contract with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Mathematica Policy Research conducted an independent systematic review of the evidence base for programs to prevent teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and/or sexual risk behaviors.

This review defined the criteria for the quality of an evaluation study and the strength of evidence for a particular intervention. Based on these criteria, HHS has defined a set of rigorous standards an evaluation must meet in order to be considered an evidence-based program. The review is being updated on an ongoing basis.

2. The Substance Abuse, Violence, and Other Risk Behavior program directory. . Through a partnership with the U.S. Department of Justice, programs are assessed by expert study reviewers from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention’s (OJJDP’s) Model Programs Guide (MPG), using www.CrimeSolutions.gov program review process, scoring instrument, and evidence standards. The MPG is an easy-to-use program database established to assist practitioners, policymakers, and communities in identifying and implementing programs that can make a difference in the lives of children and families. Information includes child victimization, substance abuse, youth violence, mental health and trauma, and gang activity.

In addition to the searchable Program Directory, the Youth.gov site also maintains the website ''A Guide to Evidence and Innovation'', which aims to help organizations select, implement, monitor, and evaluate evidence-based programs and strategies. The website includes information that can assist organizations in identifying what they are hoping to address through implementation, assessing their readiness and capacity, finding programs that meet their needs, adapting programs while maintaining fidelity, and conducting ongoing evaluation and monitoring. Users can also learn about federal efforts around evidence and the evidence base to support policies and programs as well as watch videos featuring experts in the field that can guide their program implementation efforts.

== Promoting Collaboration at the Federal, State, and Local Level ==
The IWGYP has developed a series of collaboration profiles to promote enhanced collaboration at the federal, state, and local levels. The profiles provide real-world examples of the ways that different organizations work together to improve outcomes for youth. Each collaboration is unique in their purpose, accomplishments, how they structure their work, the challenges that they face, and the types of organizations that are involved.

Featured collaboration profiles include:
* Improving Outcomes for Youth: Steps Toward Federal Collaboration
* DOI Collaborates to Engage Youth in the America’s Natural and Cultural Heritage
* DOL and HHS Work Together to Address Youth Substance Use
* Promise Neighborhoods: A Federal and Local Level Collaborative Effort
* USDA and the Military Support Youth through Positive Youth Development
* Providing Unbiased Services for LGBTQ Youth Project
* National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention
* Involving Youth at the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) Technical Assistance Meeting
* Navicate: Supporting Youth as They Transition from High School to Careers or Postsecondary Education
* Atlanta Housing Authority: Forging Partnerships that Provide Supportive Services to Customers
* Partnership for Results
* National Organizations for Youth Safety (NOYS) 
* AmeriCorps NCCC and the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program
* Project U-Turn: Addressing Philadelphia’s Dropout Crisis

== Identifying and Promoting Initiatives that Merit Interagency Collaboration ==

The IWGYP has begun to identify other promising Federal initiatives with which to engage, including the following agencies and groups: 
 
*[http://www.federalmentoringcouncil.gov Federal Mentoring Council], which seeks to coordinate mentoring programs across the Federal government;
*[http://www.juvenilecouncil.gov Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention], which coordinates Federal programs related to [[juvenile delinquency]] prevention, detention or care for unaccompanied juveniles, and missing and exploited children;
*Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking, which works to reduce and prevent underage drinking; and
*Teen Dating Violence Federal Workgroup, which seeks to coordinate efforts to support healthy relationships and reduce dating violence among teens.

== Identifying Partners and Developing Partnerships ==

The Working Group is charged with identifying and engaging key government and private or nonprofit organizations that can play a role in improving the coordination and effectiveness of programs serving and engaging youth, such as faith-based and other organizations, community coalitions and partnerships, businesses, volunteers and other key constituencies.

==History==
After seeing a dwarf woman struggling to find appropriate clothes, CEO of CBH Model Management [[Myriam Chalek]] decided she wanted to raise awareness about [[achondroplasia]] (a form of [[dwarfism]]) by exposing the fashion and modeling industry to the unexplored market of dwarfism.&lt;ref name=glam&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stark|first1=Stephanie|title=The Dwarf Fashion Show Debuts in New York City|url=http://www.glammonitor.com/2015/dwarf-fashion-show-debut-2580/|accessdate=31 December 2015|publisher=Glammonitor.com|date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/Mes-dimanches/Defile-de-mannequins-nains-pour-la-Fashion-Week-691184|title=Défilé de mannequins nains pour la Fashion Week |author=Emeline Richardin (IEJ)|date=1 October 2014|work=[[Le Journal du Dimanche|LeJDD.fr]]|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mode.blogs.france24.com/article/2014/10/01/comme-le-monde-est-petit-une-initiative-de-taille-pendant-la-fashion-week|title="Comme le monde est petit" : une initiative de taille pendant la Fashion Week|publisher=[[France 24]] blog|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalek and the nonprofit Donnons Leur Une Chance founded The Dwarf Fashion Show, consisting entirely of dwarf models. The Dwarf Fashion Show took part in Paris's annual fashion week and received extensive media coverage.&lt;ref name="WEST"&gt;{{cite news|last1=West|first1=Redazione|title=Paris fashion week to feature dwarf models|url=http://www.west-info.eu/paris-fashion-week-to-feature-dwarf-models/|accessdate=31 December 2015|work=22 September 2014|publisher=west-info.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, due to the heightened success of The Dwarf Fashion Show, Chalek took what was supposed to be a single event and created the non-profit The International Dwarf Fashion show.&lt;ref name="MUK" /&gt;

The mission of the International Dwarf Fashion Show is “to reverse the discriminatory diktats of beauty and to give the opportunity to little people to express themselves by bringing an innovative perspective to the fashion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About|url = http://www.thedwarfashionshow.com/about.html|website = The Dwarf Fashion Show|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Grattan Hendrie''' (born 24 October 1963) is a Scottish former professional [[association football]]er who played on the [[Midfielder#Winger|right wing]] or in [[Striker (association football)|attack]].

His career started at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] but he moved to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], where he played 173 consecutive league games, winning one promotion and narrowly missing out on another. Following spells with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], he moved to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and scored the final goal at [[Ayresome Park]] among his 44 goals for Boro. When he was replaced by [[Brazil]]ian [[Juninho Paulista|Juninho]] he moved to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] where he finished his career and also served as manager.

His uncle is another Scottish former pro footballer, [[Paul Hendrie]]. Paul has two sons (John's cousins) in the game; [[Lee Hendrie]] made a late substitute appearance for England in 1998 and [[Stuart Hendrie]] played for Morecambe.

==Playing career==

===Coventry City===
Hendrie started his professional football career at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], originally signing as an apprentice in June 1980, and signing full-time forms in May 1981.&lt;ref name="frost"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Frost
| first = Terry
| title = Bradford City A Complete Record 1903-1988
| publisher = Breedon Books Sport
| year = 1988
| isbn = 0-907969-38-0
| page = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a hit with Coventry's reserves, being top scorer in 1983–84, with ten goals from 25 games, but he struggled to break into the first team and played in just 21 league games during his time at Coventry. Instead he moved on a free transfer to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in 1984 following a loan spell with [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]].

===Bradford City===
Hendrie was one of two free transfers between the [[1983-84 in English football|1983–84]] and [[1984-85 in English football|1984–85]] seasons, along with [[Dave Evans (footballer)|Dave Evans]], as manager [[Trevor Cherry]] tried to build a team capable of promotion from [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]]. Hendrie was an ever-present in his first season scoring nine goals from his [[Midfielder#Winger|right wing]] position as City won the Division Three title. On the last day of that successful season his day was to turn into a nightmare when 56 spectators were killed in a horrendous stand fire while playing Lincoln City.

Hendrie continued to be one of the first names of the City team-sheet following promotion and during his four seasons at City he missed just one league game. He won a series of fans' awards and nominations for the PFA teams in 1987 and 1988.&lt;ref name="frost"/&gt; He scored ten goals in [[1985-86 in English football|1985–86]] and 14 more in [[1986-87 in English football|1986–87]]. Cherry had been replaced by [[Terry Dolan (footballer)|Terry Dolan]], who built a team pushing for promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]] in [[1987-88 in English football|1987–88]]. Hendrie was one of the key men, scoring 13 goals, but he was sent off in a 2–2 draw at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 23 April 1988. His subsequent suspension meant he missed the final league game of the season, as City lost 3–2 to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and missed out on promotion. It was the only league game Hendrie missed during his time at Valley Parade, and his 173 consecutive league appearances has only been beaten by Geoff Smith with City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last = Frost
| title = Bradford City A Complete Record 1903-1988
| year = 1988
| page = 377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrie came back for the [[Football League Championship play-offs|play-off]] games with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] but after defeat he signed for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for £500,000.&lt;ref name="frost"/&gt;

===Newcastle United and Leeds United===
Hendrie's career stalled at Newcastle United in a difficult season for the Magpies and he soon moved on to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. He spent just one season at Leeds but was voted in the top 100 Leeds players in 2000.

===Middlesbrough===
He played as a deep-lying striker for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and helped them win promotion to the newly founded [[FA Premier League]] in 1992, where on 5 December 1992 he scored a [[List of Premier League hat-tricks|hat-trick]] in a 3–2 win against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dobson |first=Frank |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-rovers-rocked-by-hendrie-hattrick-1561793.html |title=Rovers rocked by Hendrie hat-trick |date=6 December 1992 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |work=The Independent |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrie was their leading scorer in 1995 when they won promotion back to the top flight. He secured legendary status on [[Teesside]] by scoring the last ever goal at [[Ayresome Park]].

===Barnsley===
He left the following year after losing his place in the first team to [[Juninho Paulista]], and joined [[Football League First Division|Division One]] side [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. Once again, Hendrie contributed towards his club winning promotion as Barnsley finished Division One runners-up and became top division members for the first time in their history. Hendrie was unable to prevent Barnsley from suffering relegation in [[1997-98 in English football|1997–98]], and after the end of the season he succeeded [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]] as manager.

==Managerial career==
John Hendrie  was sacked on 19 April 1999 after just one season in charge of Barnsley, having failed to achieve a promotion play off place.

== History ==
{{See|Palacio de Xifré}}

=== Early period ===
The current Ministry was created in the [[Constituent Legislature of Spain|Constituent Legislature]] in 1977, integrating responsibilities for Health that were hitherto managed by the [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of the Interior]], and the powers of the Secretariat of [[Social Security in Spain|Social Security]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1977/07/05/102.html [[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] Hemeroteca. Nuevo Gobierno sin grandes sorpresas. July 5, 1977]&lt;/ref&gt;

References can be found to the action of Government in public health and welfare in the nineteenth century. A Royal Decree of 9 November 1832 created a [[Ministry of Public Works and Transport (Spain)|Ministry of Public Works and Transport]], which included powers over "the field of health with the infirmaries, water and mineral baths" and "charitable institutions".
&lt;ref&gt;[http://usuarios.multimania.es/art_arab/1832/18321109.html Real decreto de 9 de Noviembre de 1832.- Ministerio de Fomento, dando forma y señalando atribuciones á la Secretaría de Fomento.

A further Royal Decree of March 10, 1847, created a Department of Health, one of six that made up what is now the Ministry of the Interior.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lJYrrk98NKkC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=%22Direcci%C3%B3n+de+Gobernaci%C3%B3n+Pol%C3%ADtica%22+and+%221847%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ExEEJuvPV0&amp;sig=3TWMmnmJS3QIfmXZb7Cz0okc_l8&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=30ZCTsn1BYOyhAeRwNiqCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%2210%20de%20marzo%22&amp;f=false El ministerio de comercio, instrucción y obras públicas, 1847-1851. José Antonio Pérez Juan (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt;
State powers in this area remained with this department until 1933, when the Secretariat of Health and Welfare was transferred to the [[Ministry of Labor (Spain)|Ministry of Labour]], which then became known as the Ministry of Labour and Health.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1933/12/23/019.html El Consejo de Ministros de ayer [[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] 23 de diciembre de 1933]&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 4, 1936, the Ministry of Health and Welfare was created, with a woman holding a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] portfolio for the first time in the history of Spain: [[Federica Montseny]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caum.es/CARPETAS/cuadernos/cuadernospdf/libro16/Salud_y_%20republica.pdf La Sanidad y la Asistencia Social durante la Guerra Civil. Federica Montseny (ed.), 23 de diciembre de 1933] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924111840/http://www.caum.es/CARPETAS/Cuadernos/cuadernospdf/libro16/Salud_y_%20republica.pdf |date=2011-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This ministry was short-lived. When the Prime Minister of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]], [[Juan Negrín]], replaced [[Francisco Largo Caballero]] the ministry was abolished and absorbed into the Ministry of Labour, once again under a decree of July 5, 1937. After the [[Spanish Civil War]], the responsibility returned to the Ministry of the Interior until 1977.

=== Constituent legislature 1977 - ===
Royal Decree 1558 of July 4, 1977 established the ministry in its current form, including responsibility for Social Security. Staffing consisted of two secretariats (the Department and Health), a Technical Secretariat and six Directorates: Staff, Management and Finance, Benefits, Social Services Healthcare, Pharmaceutical Management and Public Health and Veterinary Public Health.

For a short period between February and November 1981, Health was once again merged with Labour. Royal Decree 2823 of 1981, restored it to full ministerial rank but this time without social security which remained with the Labour ministry. With the victory of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] in the [[Spanish general election, 1996|elections of 1996]], [[Jose Manuel Romay Beccaria]] was appointed Minister of Health and Consumer Affairs, a position he held throughout the [[6th Legislature of Spain|Sixth Legislature]]. Under his direction was created in 1997, the [[Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products]] (Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios). In the [[7th Legislature of Spain|Seventh Legislature]] [[Celia Villalobos]] became minister (2000-2002) and achieved notoriety by her handling [[mad cow disease]]. She was succeeded by [[Ana Pastor Julián]] (2002-2004). The mad cow crisis precipitated the creation, under Law 11/2001, of the Spanish Food Safety Agency (Agencia Española de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutrición, and from 2007: Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutrición).

At the beginning of the [[8th Legislature of Spain|eighth legislature]] [[Elena Salgado]] became minister (2004-7), but the National Plan on Drugs (Plan Nacional sobre Drogas) was shifted to the Ministry of the Interior (2004). On 6 July 2007, Bernat Soria (2007-9), a scientist by background, succeeded her. In the [[9th Legislature of Spain|current (ninth) legislature]] Soria was re-appointed in 2008, and succeeded by [[Trinidad Jiménez]] (2009–10) following a cabinet shuffle. Under Jiménez Social Policy was returned to the health portfolio, including the Institute for the Elderly and Social Services (Instituto de Mayores y Servicios Sociales), previously under [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Education]]. Under [[Leire Pajín]] (October 2010-December 2011), responsibility for Equality issues were added to her duties, previously under a [[Ministry of Equality (Spain)|separate ministry]] of its own, and the Institute for Women (Instituto de la Mujer), and the Institute for Youth (''Instituto de la Juventud''). At the beginning of the current [[Government of the 10th Legislature of Spain|tenth legislature]] [[Ana Mato]] became minister. On 24 November 2014, she resigned. On 3 December 2014, Alfonso Alonso succeeded her.

[[File:New Born Foundation- Working Internationally.jpg|thumb|Annamarie Saarinen, co-founder of the Newborn Foundation, uses a mobile phone pulse oximeter to screen a newborn at Beichuan People's Hospital in Sichuan, China.]]
'''The Newborn Foundation''' is a Minnesota-based international 501(c)3 non-profit organization that works to spread the implementation of neonatal screening to reduce infant mortality.

== Background ==
The Newborn Foundation is credited with persuading the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] to formally recommend universal [[pulse oximetry]] screening for congenital heart defects in every child born in the United States.&lt;ref name="well.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/a-mothers-fight-for-newborn-hearts/?_r=0|title=A Mother's Fight for Newborn Hearts|last=Sanghavi|first=Darshak|date=17 November 2011|work=Well|publisher=The New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annamarie Saarinen co-founded the Newborn Foundation in 2010 after her daughter, Eve Saarinen, was nearly discharged from her hospital nursery with an undetected critical congenital heart defect (CCHD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2014/09/22/mn-babys-heart-defect-leads-to-test-that-saves-lives/|title=MN Baby’s Heart Defect Leads To Test That Saves Lives|work=CBS Minnesota|last=Slavik|first=Rachel|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saarinen formed the Newborn Foundation to ensure the addition the CCHD testing to the federal Routine Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP).&lt;ref name="well.blogs.nytimes.com" /&gt; The Newborn Foundation awarded [[OZ Systems]] CEO Dr. Terese Finitzo the EVE Innovation Award for achievements in newborn screening, policy and technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newbornfoundation.org/content/newborn-foundation-honors-leaders-newborn-health-technology-policy-and-advocacy-2014-awards&lt;/ref&gt;

== BORN project ==
After successfully implementing policy that would create mandates around newborn heart screening in the United States, the Newborn Foundation launched the BORN (Birth Oximetry Routine for Newborns) project. The BORN project is a global health initiative that aims to bring affordable, mobile newborn screening to developing nations. In September 2015, the BORN project was selected by the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]] as one of 14 innovation projects to help achieve their 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/this-test-for-heart-disease-in-newborns-costs-less-than-1739158499|title=This Test For Heart Disease in Newborns Costs Less Than a Diaper Change|last=Lufkin|first=Bryan|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Gizmodo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@WhiteHouse/it-takes-a-network-9e7831333906#.aiuy2rbh3|title=IT TAKES A NETWORK.|last=Smith|first=Megan|publisher=The White House|via=Medium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ova donated in this way are known as '''donor ova'''.

==General==
There are currently very few ova banks in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brusselsivf.be/default.aspx?pageId=6725 Centre for Reproductive Medicine of UZ Brussel having an ova bank]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_ova-bank-comes-to-india_1067985 The Bandra-based Lilavati Hospital having an ova bank]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wonderwoman.intoday.in/story/china-to-set-up-ovum-bank/1/88404.html Renji Hospital, Shanghai having an ova bank]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the main purpose of storing ova, at present, is to overcome infertility which may arise at a later age, or due to a disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3300">'''Remote guidance''', in the medical context, refers to the supervision or guidance of a medical task, usually a procedures or test, from a remote location.  This falls in the realm of [[Real-time computing|real time]] [[telemedicine]] applications.  By way of example, a [[radiologist]] may guide an [[ultrasound]] examination from a remote location.  As such the proximate requisite expertise to accomplish a medical task is significantly diminished.  In the previous example, a diagnostic quality ultrasound can be accomplished by non-medically trained individuals manipulating an ultrasound device located with the patient under guidance from a remote location.   This is an example of [[teleradiology]] If appropriately configured, the remote guidance can originate from another room or floor in the same building, to as far away as another continent or even planet.  [[NASA]] researchers have successfully demonstrated remote guidance of diagnostic level [[cardiac ultrasonography]] using an ultrasound on the space station, non-medical astronauts performing the exam  as guided by a terrestrially located expert.

== Remote diagnostics ==

Remote diagnostics refers to a real time [[telemedical]] application which achieves [[diagnostic]] level quality and information exchange.  In this sense, it refers to an expectation for quality sufficient for making or excluding a [[medical diagnosis]].  In the tele-medical context specific to radiologic images these images often are consistent with the [[DICOM]] standard.  Given bandwidth issues universally plaguing the healthcare environment imagery beyond still images and brief video has not yet become standard expectation of care environments or [[Picture Archiving and Communication System|PACS]] systems.  Ultrasound scanning commonly utilized for [[abdomen]], [[musculoskeletal]], [[human pelvis|pelvis]], [[gynecologic]], [[human heart|cardiac]] and [[vascular]] evaluations has shown potential for remote diagnosis only of late.

More general [[Remote diagnostics|Remote Diagnostics]] (RD) refers to detecting which fault or faults are present in a system, body of object, from a distance. Examples of use: aeroplanes, spacecraft, Formula 1 and major assets such as ships, trains etc. In cases where corrective actions are also made, the term 'Remote Diagnostic &amp; Maintenance' is more appropriate.

== Technical aspects ==

While still imagery can be e-mailed and forwarded in a multitude of methods, video product of medical devices has typically not been available for remote interaction.  Recent improvements in scanning devices, for example ultrasound machines has facilitated this new capability.  The inclusion of the [[VGA]] output gives the opportunity for [[frame grabber]] devices to stream such outputs to the internet.

The '''State Drugs and Medications Control Service''' ({{lang-ua|Державна служба України з лікарських засобів та контролю за наркотиками}}) is a [[Government of Ukraine|national]] [[law enforcement agency]] of [[Ukrainian Government|executive authority]] responsible for drafting state policy, legal regulation, control and monitoring in combating trafficking drugs, psychotropic substances, medications and their precursors. The Service is specially authorized to address and solve problems relating to traffic in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, and their precursors; the Service is also authorized to combat the illicit drug trafficking. Commonly was known as The Drugs Control Service (Derzhavna Sluzhba Narcocontrolya).

The Service was formed on September 10, 2014 by Cabinet Resolution No. 442 by the merge of the State Service for Drugs Control (Державна слу́жба Украї́ни з контро́лю за нарко́тиками) and the State Service of Medicines (Державна служба України з лікарських засобів).

The service is formed for implementation of state policy in the areas of:
*quality and safety of medical products, including medical immuno-biological drugs, medical equipment and medical products that are in circulation and / or used in the health sector, approved for implementation in pharmacy institutions and their structural units;
*licensing of economic activities for the production of drugs, importing drugs, wholesale and retail sale of medicines;
*trafficking in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, their analogues and precursors, combating illicit trafficking.

The activities of this body is directed and coordinated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, directly and through the Minister of Healthcare.

'''Stop AIDS Project''' (SAP) is a United States [[nonprofit organization]] established in 1985 that works to prevent [[HIV]] transmission among all [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[trans men]] in [[San Francisco]], California, through multicultural, community based organizing.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Allen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DGUEAAAAMBAJ "Too Sexy For Saving Lives?: Right-wing politicians are targeting sexually frank HIV prevention programs and materials. But AIDS advocates aren't backing down from what they say is an effective approach]", ''The Advocate'', Aug 16, 2005, pp 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Internationally recognized as a successful model of grassroots prevention and support, SAP brings diverse gay, bisexual, and trans men together to talk about the challenges and issues posed by Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]) through neighborhood outreach, workshops and community forums.

Their work extends beyond education—helping change behavior, create personal commitment to safer sex, build community support for each individual, with the [[mission statement]]: HIV transmission can be prevented.

== Mission ==
The mission of STOP AIDS Project is to prevent HIV transmission among all gay, bisexual and transgender men in San Francisco through collaborative and multicultural, community- based organizing.

A '''straw man''' (''ritual doll'') is a [[Mannequin|dummy]] in the shape of a human usually made up entirely out of [[straw]] material, or created by stuffing straw into clothes.

==Uses==
Straw men are commonly used as [[scarecrow]]s, combat training targets, [[Bladesmith|swordsmith]]s' test targets, [[effigies]] to be burned, and as [[rodeo]] dummies to distract bulls.   

==Rodeo straw men==
In the sport of [[rodeo]], the '''straw man''' is a dummy, originally made of a shirt and pants stuffed with straw. The straw man is placed in the arena during bullriding events as a safety measure. It is intended to distract the bull after the rider has dismounted (or has been thrown), with the idea that the bull will attack the straw man rather than attack its former rider. Two so-called [[rodeo clown]]s &amp;ndash; people dressed in bright colors whose job it is to distract the bull if the rider is injured &amp;ndash; are in the ring as well and are usually far more effective than the straw man.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

{{Disability}}
'''Supported employment''' refers to service provisions wherein people with [[Disability|disabilities]], including [[intellectual disabilities]], [[mental health]], and [[traumatic brain injury]], among others, are assisted with obtaining and maintaining [[employment]]. Supported employment is considered to be one form of employment in which wages are expected, together with benefits from an employer in a competitive workplace, though some versions refer to disability agency paid employment.
Companies such as [[Skilcraft]] in the United States are an example of supported employment.

==Community foundations==
Supported employment was developed in the United States in the 1970s as part of both [[vocational rehabilitation]] (VR) services (e.g., NYS Office of Vocational Services, 1978) and the advocacy for long term services and supports (LTSS) for individuals with significant disabilities in competitive job placements in integrated settings (e.g., businesses, offices, manufacturing facilities). Since the mid-1980s, supported employment in the professional literature primarily has referred to the "individual placement" model, either with job coaches or through "natural supports" models.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, J. &amp; Hagner, D. (1988). Natural supports in the workplace: A re-examination of supported employment. "Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps", 13(4): 260-267.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. (1990). "Working On...A Survey of Emerging Issues in Supported Employment for People with Severe Disabilities". Lithonia, GA: Responsive Systems Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical issue in supported employment (SE) was viewed as the need for funding for [[long-term services and supports (LTSS)]] in the community often termed beyond "case closure" (Griffin, Test, Dalton, &amp; Wood, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, S.L., Test, D.W., Dalton, B. &amp; Wood, W. (1995). Long-term supports and services: Toward definition, clarification, and implications for the future. "Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation" (JVR), 5: 177-185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, J., Rogan, P. &amp; Hagner, D. (1989). Squeezing long-term supports out of a short-term program: Independence issues and supported employment. "Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling", 20(3): 21-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Supported employment is worldwide in 2013, though moving to new inclusive models, and the term has been used for assisting workers of diverse kinds who may need an extra jump start in the workplace; it is still associated with its roots in disability which includes [[community integration]] and [[deinstitutionalization]] &lt;ref&gt;http://patimes.org/community-disability-deinstitutionalization/&lt;/ref&gt;

==University development of concept==
Supported employment came from the community non-profit sector as an effort with government to offer services to individuals with significant disabilities, some of whom were moving from institutional life, in local communities for "supported work" (around the late 1970s). Community personnel entered rehabilitation programs, for degrees, and began an academic professionalization of the fields. Supported employment (SE) was on the rise nationally in the US in 1985 with growing university support, new dedicated agencies and programs, and preparation of master's and doctoral students in rehabilitation and education (e.g., [[Syracuse University]], Rehabilitation Counseling, and [[Social Policy]] degrees). As an example, Thomas Bellamy, Larry Rhodes and Jay Albin of Oregon prepared a new chapter titled "Supported Employment" which indicated its uniqueness as having no entry requirement and no minimum ability levels (unheard of in vocational programs) in order to include candidates regardless of the nature or degree of their disability".&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy, G.T., Rhodes, L, &amp; Albin, J.M. (1985). Supported employment. In: W. Kiernan &amp; J. Stark, "Pathways to Employment for Developmentally Disabled Adults". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. Not for dissemination in current form.&lt;/ref&gt;

""Supported employment"" was based upon principles of [[community integration]] and the site location termed an "integrated setting" was a core component of the applied and theoretical models (e.g., community integration theories, social role valorization, normalization, independent living theories, universal design). In addition, other critical aspects were paid work, vocational choices, employer development, school to work transition to job sites, and involvement of parents in the employment process.&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P. &amp; Moon, S. (1985). Critical values in employment programs for persons with developmental disabilities. In: P. Wehman &amp; M. Hill, "Competitive Employment for Persons with Mental Retardation, from Research to Practice, Volume 1". Supported by the National Institute on Handicapped Research, US Department of Education awarded to the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center at Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/ref&gt; A Rehabilitation Research and Training Center (RRTC) on Supported Employment or related Employment and Disability areas has been funded in the university sector from the federal levels for over three decades under the leadership of [[Dr. Paul Wehman]].

===Diversity in supported employment models===
By 1985, supported employment based on community integration had diverse vocational models in the US, including the social relationship concept of "disabled and non-disabled co-workers" working side-by-side in integrated workplaces (Nisbet &amp;Callahan, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, J. &amp; Callahan, M.

In the psychiatric field, the prominent approach, also very innovative in long term services and supports (LTSS) was transitional employment &lt;ref&gt;Phillips, J.R. &amp; Biller, E.F.

(2002). "Psychiatric Rehabilitation". Boston, MA: Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, Sargent College of Allied Sciences, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== US legal basis ==
The legal "Integration" base for supported employment was described by Frank Laski, of [[The Public Interest Law Center]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, (1985, April) as being the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] (as revised by the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act#Legislative history|Individual Disabilities Education Improvement Act]]) and the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] (amended 1978) passed by the US Congress. He also found strong support for moving from sheltered settings to supported employment in [[Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act]] (1975, as amended 1984) and fully supported a "zero reject" policy, individualized work plans, and questioning the notion of the "employability" concept.&lt;ref&gt;Laski, F.J. (1985, April 1). "Legislative, Regulatory, and Financial Issues Affecting the Rehabilitation and Vocational Achievement of Person with Autism". Prepared for the National Conference on Autism hold in Rockville, Maryland. Reading Package for Legal Issues in the Employment of Persons with Handicaps (SPE 600), Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported employment, emanating from the sheltered and governmental services sectors, has different roots than employment based upon traditional civil rights and discrimination approaches. Employment and disability often shares common roots with others disadvantaged in employment, based on discrimination due to gender, race, ethnicity, family structure, and disability, among other "differences"  (e.g., Urban League of Onondaga County, Inc.). Such coalition based strategies emanate from the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and seek redress in employment based upon discrimination in hiring, promotions, terminations, and payments, among others. Such positions are not "dedicated positions", but may involve a reasonable accommodation (e.g., personal assistant, work desk modification) to perform the job as defined by the primary tasks of the employer-based system for "qualified individuals" [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]], now amended in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Blanck, P. (2000). "Employment, Disability and the Americans with Disabilities Act: Issues in Law, Public Policy and Research". Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Button, S. &amp; Wobschall, R. (1994). The Americans with Disabilities Act and Assistive Technology. "Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation", 4(3): 196-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1991, proposed rules for the State Supported Employment Grant Program were published in the Federal Register for comment by the US Department of Education, and the announcement was made available to deaf and hearing impaired individuals through a TDD service (FR 56: 219.57776-57786). The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA)received comments, and the intent was to advance the program authorized under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Part C, as amended which supported disability rights in employment in the community. It also advanced the national goals of "literacy and "lifelong learning" for skills in the "global economy". in 2013, the US Department of Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation Services Administration, issued a policy directive on supported employment (RSA-PD-13-02, April 30, 2013).

==United States development of supported employment==

In the United States, supported employment is defined in the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (1978). The more recent Rehabilitation Act Amendments were contained in the Workforce Investment Act signed into law in 1998. The Rehabilitation Act and its amendments establish and fund the Vocational Rehabilitation program. Vocational Rehabilitation, which is frequently referred to as “V.R.”, is the core national employment program for persons with a disability, but is not the main agency to fund long-term services and supports (LTSS) in the community.  Federal funding is funneled through state Vocational Rehabilitation agencies, and categorical state agencies and their regional offices (e.g., New York Office of People with Developmental Disabilities) are also involved, including Home and Community-Based (HCB) Medicaid Services Waiver funded programs nationwide.

===Core definition===
Here is a representation of the core definition of supported employment as it is contained in the Rehabilitation Act Amendments (Public Law 102-569: Supported Employment Definitions).&lt;ref&gt;Goodall, P., Lawyer, H. &amp; Wehman, P. (1994). Supported employment definitions (p.73). Vocational rehabilitation and traumatic brain injury: A legislative and public policy perspective. "Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation", 9(2): 61-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Supported employment means: 
A. Competitive employment in an integrated setting with ongoing support services for individuals with the most significant disabilities –
a) for whom competitive employment has not traditionally occurred; or &lt;br/&gt;
b) for whom competitive employment has been interrupted or intermittent as a result of significant disability; and &lt;br/&gt;
c) who, because of the nature and severity of their disabilities, need ongoing support services including both intensive initial support services and also extended services after transition from those initial support services in order to perform work; or &lt;br/&gt;
B. Transitional employment for individuals with the most significant disabilities due to mental illness.

There are a number of important critically important terms and concepts referenced in this definition of supported employment. These terms are:
*Individuals with the most significant disabilities
*Competitive employment
*Integrated work setting
*Ongoing support services and supported employment services.

The most common model of supported employment involves job coaching with the traditional rehabilitation approach to "fade services" into the work setting; however, supported employment has roots in long-term supports and services, and variations based upon "natural supports" (e.g., payments to a coworker to provide assistance).&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, D., Rogan, P. &amp; Murphy, S. (1992, January–March). Facilitating natural supports in the workplace: Strategies for support consultants. "Journal of Rehabilitation", 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Principles of Parents for Positive Futures were: real jobs in real workplaces, services for all, ongoing support, social integration, and individualized and flexible. Self advocates agreed with Real jobs for real pay, especially starting from "make work" in institutional settings.

In the vocational rehabilitation systems, concepts of working with business and industry, competitive employment (e.g., achieving existing job classifications and wages and benefits), transition to the workforces from schools, and traditional obstacles to work including competition, are all addressed in the VR systems. &lt;ref&gt; Rusch, F.R. (1986). "Competitive Employment Issues and Strategies". Baltimore, MD Paul H. Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Kiernan, W.E. &amp; Schalock, R.L. (1989). "Economics, Industry and Disability". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
Costs of supported employment have been an area of research and study since its inception, and include academic studies in categorical disability areas (e.g., psychiatric, traumatic brain injury) regarding long-term services in competitive settings (e.g., Wehman et al., 2003; Rogers et al., 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P., Kregel, J., Keyser-Marcus, L., Sherron-Targett, P., Campbell, L, West, M. &amp; Cifu, D. (2003, February). Supported employment for persons with traumatic brain injury: A preliminary investigation of long-term follow-up costs and program efficiency. "Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation", 84:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.S., Sciarappa, K., MacDonald-Wilson, K. &amp; Danley, K. (1995). A benefit-cost analysis of a supported employment model for persons with psychiatric disabilities. "Evaluation and Program Planning", 18(2): 105-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported employment was designed to be cost-effective and cost-beneficial, and indeed has been documented to be so as a key community services in public administration and disability (Racino, in press, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (in press, 2014). Employment and adult day programs in the US. "Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US". NY, NY: Taylor and Francis, CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, two cost trends are the medical center gates which change the cost structure and personnel (from collaboration between education and medical to medical operations; "physical restoration" by a "physiatrist");&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P., Targett, P.S., &amp; Cifu, D. (2006). Job coaches: A workplace support. "American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation", 85(8)704.&lt;/ref&gt; and a government trend to cut the cost of its already lean services (e.g., natural supports to lower costs).&lt;ref&gt;Cimera, R.E. (2007). Utilizing natural supports to lower the cost of supported employment. "Research and Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities", 32(3): 184-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cimera's 2012 review on the "economics of supported employment" indicated that:
1. Individuals fare better financially from working in the community rather than sheltered workshops, regardless of disability.
2. Relative wages earned by supported employees were up 31.2% since the 1980s, while sheltered workshop wages decreased.
Over 30 studies were reviewed in the 1980s and 1990s including in the US, Australia, Great Britain and Canada finding that "individuals with disabilities experience greater monetary benefits than costs when working in the community".&lt;ref&gt;Cimera, R. E. (2012). The economics of supported employment: what new data tell us. "Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation", 37: 109-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, concerns regarding subminimum wage and employment extend to the community,&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Disability. (2012, August). "National Council on Disability Report on Submission Wage and Supported Employment". Washington, DC: Author. http://www.ncd.gov/publications/2012).&lt;/ref&gt; especially due to the interplay of benefits, entry level versus skilled jobs, wages paid to the employee versus employer benefits, and dead end versus career approaches. However, early studies reported benefits of $1.97 to every dollar in cost with $13,815 in gross wages and fringe benefits to the employee (Hill et al., 1987) &lt;ref&gt;Hill, M.L, Banks, P.D., Hardrock, R.R., Wehman, P. H., Hill, J.W., &amp; Shafer, M.S. (1987). Benefit-cost analysis of supported competitive employment for persons with mental retardation. "Research in Developmental Disabilities", 8: 71-89.&lt;/ref&gt; whom others viewed as "permanently unemployable" or "unable to work".

In addition, reviews of costs and benefits do not indicate the revenue streams for supported employment, especially when these programs can be one service of a large community "disability NGO" (non-governmental organization) and were eligible for Medicaid financing as early as 1991 (Smith &amp; Gettings, 1991).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G. &amp; Gettings, R. (1991). "Supported Employment and Medicaid Financing". Alexandria, VA: National Association of State Mental Retardation Program Directors.&lt;/ref&gt; Government itself in the late 2000s is increasingly concerned about costs, and [[vocational rehabilitation]] services, are being reviewed for their cost-effectiveness and ways to increase positive outcomes for clientele of their services &lt;ref&gt;Rigles, B., Ipsen, C., Arnold, N. &amp; Seekins, T. (2011). Experiences of rural vocational rehabilitation clients who leave the system prematurely: A qualitative exploration. "Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin", 54(3): 164-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment supports==
Supported employment evolved as a way to assist individuals with the most significant disabilities with employment in their communities...a real job for real pay, and involves personal assistance services including for people who lived in institutions in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. with Whittico, P. (1994). Self advocacy and the promise of community employment. In: P. Wehman &amp; J. Kregel, "More than a Job: Securing Satisfying Careers for Individuals with Disabilities." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; For over 30 years supported employment has demonstrated that individuals with severe disabilities can work,&lt;ref&gt;Kregel, J., Shafer, M., Wehman, P., &amp; West, M. (1989). Policy development and expenditures in supported employment: Current strategies to promote statewide change. "TASH", 14(4): 283-292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cioffi, A., Buckley, J., &amp; Mank, (1989). "Bibliography on Supported Employment". Eugene, OR: The Employment Network, College of Education, University of Oregon.&lt;/ref&gt; yet today many individuals remain segregated in sheltered workshops and day programs. Efforts to convert sheltered workshops to provide supported employment (now, one person at a time) are underway, and a generation of Master's level students in Rehabilitation Counseling and Special Education have been educated in changing services and organizations from older, outdated segregation models to integrated vocational approaches in the community (e.g., Gardner, et al., 1988; Rogan &amp; Racino, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, J., Chapman, M., Donaldson, G. &amp; Jacobson, S. (1988). "Towards Supported Employment: A Process Guide for Planned Change." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogan, P. &amp; Racino, J. (1992). "Community Services and Systems Change". RCE/SPE 638: Section 04. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Division of Rehabilitation and Special Education and the Center on Human Policy.&lt;/ref&gt; Verdicts in recent lawsuits upholding the right to work in inclusive settings seem to indicate that integrated employment will soon be the first choice.

Best practices dictate that an individualized support approach to supported employment, funded as a professional vocational rehabilitation service (now changing to infusion of risk and protective health factors),&lt;ref&gt;Ipsen, C., Seekins, T., &amp; Ravesloot, C. (2010). Building the case for delivering health promotion services within the vocational rehabilitation system. "Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin", 53(2): 67-77.&lt;/ref&gt; is used to assist individuals with gaining and maintaining employment (later, termed job retention).&lt;ref&gt;West, M. (1992). Job retention: Toward vocational competence, self-management, and natural supports. In: P.Wehman, P. Sale, &amp; W. Parent, " Supported Employment: Strategies for Integration of Workers with Disabilities". Boston: Andover Medical Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; These practices may involve a supported employment service provider (professionals)to understand how to customize employment and provide supports, school personnel in transition,&lt;ref&gt;Rogan, P. &amp; Held, M. (1995). Paraprofessionals in job coach roles. "JASH", 24(4): 273-280.&lt;/ref&gt; or it may involve an approach similar to bridgebuilding and person-centered community development.&lt;ref&gt;Mount, B., Beeman, R. &amp; Ducharme, G. (1988). "What Are We Learning About Bridgebuilding?" Manchester, CT: Communitas.&lt;/ref&gt;  Supports could include: modifying a job, adding accommodations or assistive technology, enhancing on the job site training among other approaches, such as identifying network relationships (e.g., family business, local job sites and owners) and training parents regarding better futures.&lt;ref&gt;PACER Center. (1988, August). A Reference Manual for Parent Training about Supported Employment". Minneapolis, MN: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; What is needed will vary from one person and one employer to the next, but do involve the human resource offices, the funding agencies, the supervisory levels, and even union leadership, among others. In 2010, [[customized employment]], state employment first policies, and "revisiting key federal policies" are recommended as leadership in "employment of persons with severe disabilities";&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth, J. &amp; Callahan, M. (2010). Reestablishing TASH's leadership in employment for persons with severe disabilities. "Research and Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities", 35: 1-2, 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt; however, with a newer movement toward the development of "non-work supports".

Early supported employment agency leaders, shifting from services to supports, included Jerry Kiracofe's Human Services Institute in Maryland (Kiracofe, 1994),&lt;ref&gt;Kiracofe, J. (1994). Strategies to help agencies shift from services to supports. In: V.J. Bradley, J.W. Ashbaugh, &amp; B.C. Blaney, "Creating Individual Supports for People with Developmental Disabilities". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Strully originally in Kentucky at Seven Counties Services (now, Rogan &amp; Strully, 2007 in Colorado and California), Richard Crowley's area agency in New Hampshire (Rogan, 1992), ENABLE and Transitional Living Services in New York (the latter simply deciding in 1977 that "long term clients" in the community had a right to seek jobs and work, supported by "residential staff"), agencies in Oregon (Magis-Agosta, 1994), Wisconsin (Racino, 1987)&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1985/7). "A Site Visit to Community Work Services in Madison, Wisconsin". Syracuse, NY: Research and Training Center on Community Integration, Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy.&lt;/ref&gt; and Great Britain, among others. These groups were associated also with research studies on job supports, workplace culture, and gender and ethnic concerns in employment structures.&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, D. &amp; DiLeo, D. (1993).

A gender perspective: Employment, equality and gender. In: "Resources in Supported Employment". Syracuse, NY: Center on Human Policy, Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Community Integration, Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt; Supported employment was studied early in Canada in relationship to quality of life and an employment support worker (Pedlar, Lord &amp; Loon, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;Pedlar, A., Lord, J., &amp; Loon, M. (1989). "Supported Employment and Quality of Life". Kitchener, Ontario: Centre for Research and Education in Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal assistance services===
Personal assistance services, a premier service of public policy and independent living, has a strong national and international research base dating back to the 1980s.(Litvak, Zukas &amp; Heumann, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;Litvak, S., Heumann, J. &amp; Zukas, H. (1987). "Attending to America: Personal Assistance for Independent Living". Berkeley, CA: World Institute on Disability.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nosek, M. (1991). Personal assistance services: A review of the literature and analysis of policy implications. "Journal of Disability Policy Studies", 2(2): 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal assistance services (PAS)has expanded to be an important component of "workplace supports" (Soloveiva, et al., 2010) &lt;ref&gt;Soloveiva, T., Wallsh, R., Hendricks, D., &amp; Dowler, D. (2010). Workplace personal assistance services for people with disabilities: Making productive employment possible. "Journal of Rehabilitation", 76(4): 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of working schemes in countries such as Sweden (Clevner &amp; Johansson, @2012).&lt;ref&gt;Clevner, U. &amp; Johansson, L. (@2012). Supported employment. In: A. Gottlieb, Myhill, &amp; P. Blanck, Employment of people with disabilities. "International Encyclopedia of Rehabilitation".  at http://cirrie.buffalo.edu/encyclopedia/en/contents/s/&lt;/ref&gt; Personal assistance services and workplace PAS has been taught through Virginia Commonwealth University as an online course and is available in 2013 as a self-study through the independent living network.(http://www.worksupport.com/pas/funding.cfm) PAS has been developed for use by diverse groups, including in cognitive disabilities, inclusive of mental health, brain injuries and intellectual disabilities, and for individuals with medical and physical needs for assistance (Racino, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1995). Personal assistance services for, by and with adults, youth and children with disabilities. "Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation", 5: 2015-211.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural supports===
Natural supports models were funded by the federal and state governments, but public discussion of the concept and implementation has been lacking giving its relevance to workplaces. "Natural supports funding packages" were recommended by the university sector to state employment agencies with preferences for schemes which are based upon coworker training, the use of employment specialists to facilitate natural supports, and matching the supported employee with the natural supports of the worksites.&lt;ref&gt;Sowers, J., Milliken, K., Cotton, P., Sousa, S. Dwyer, L. &amp; Kouwenhoven, K. (2000). A multi-element approach to creating change in a state employment system. In: J. Nisbet &amp; D. Hagner, " Part of the Community" (pp. 203-236). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Early models of "natural supports" were proposed by the rehabilitation community as part of research studies (e.g., Hagner, 1988),&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, D. (1988). "A Qualitative Study of Supported Employees". Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Community Integration.&lt;/ref&gt; and knowing the colloquial paths of this approach international speaker Racino retorted, "What is natural about natural supports anyway?" &lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1994, September). "Review of Natural Supports in School, at Work and Community for People with Severe Disabilities". "American Journal on Mental Retardation.", 99(2): 221-224.&lt;/ref&gt; The natural supports approaches were also aligned with related initiatives including empowerment and choice in employment,&lt;ref&gt;Olney, M. &amp; Salamone, P. (1992). Empowerment and choice in supported employment. "Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling", 29(2): 3-80.&lt;/ref&gt; and gender differences in supported employment.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D., Cioffi, A., Yovanoff, P. &amp; Mank, D. (2000, April). Gender differences in supported employment. "Mental Retardation", 38(2): 89-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasonable accommodations as an employment support===
One of the innovations from work with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended in 1978 was the application of the concept of reasonable accommodations to fields such as psychiatric disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Mancuso, L. (1990). Reasonable accommodations for workers with psychiatric disabilities. "Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal", 14(2): 3-19.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of deinstitutionalization efforts, now at the US Supreme Court's Olmstead Decision of 1999, "long-term services and supports" (LTSS) clients were seeking work in communities to support themselves (and sometimes families) in homes and daily lives. Systemic efforts were made to identify barriers to employment (e.g., Noble &amp; Collignon, 1988),&lt;ref&gt;Noble, J.H. &amp; Collignon, F. (1988). Systems barriers to supported employment for persons with chronic mental illness. In: P. Wehman &amp; S. Moon, "Vocational Rehabilitation and Supported Employment". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; and legal avenues were also opened as described by Dr. Peter Blanck on the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Reasonable accommodation &lt;ref&gt; Michaels, C., Nappo, P., Barrett, K., Risucci, D.A., &amp; Harles, C.W. (1993). Provisions of reasonable accommodation: What do employers think?  In: P. Wehman, "The ADA Mandate for Change". (pp. 89-115). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; allowed modifications on the job, while still retaining the competitive job site and pay grades in the community. The term "employment supports" was also applied to efforts to assist individuals which may come to the rehabilitation system with a "mental health diagnosis" (Marrone, Bazell, &amp; Gold, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Marrone, J., Balzell, A., &amp; Gold, M. (1995, July). Employment supports for people with mental illness. "Psychiatric Services", 46(7): 707-711.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts may resemble those termed "natural supports" since job retention (involving coworkers and supervisors), as opposed to job placement (a traditional rehabilitation counselor function) &lt;ref&gt;Salamone, P. (1971). A Client-Centered Approach to Job Placement. "Vocational Guidance Quarterly", 14(4): 266-270.&lt;/ref&gt; may be key.

==Systems change==
Supported employment was visualized as a way to change segregated services systems, based largely upon sheltered workshop facilities, to an integrated community approach to employment for individuals, primarily with intellectual and developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Kregel, J. &amp; McDonald, R. System change.conversion. In: M. Barcus, S. Griffin, D. Mank, L. Rhodes, &amp; S. Moon, "Supported Employment Implementation Issues". Richmond, VA: Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1995, California leaders Steve Zivolich and Jan Weiner-Zivolich inquired of the provider and governmental sectors: "If Not Now, When?: The Case Against Waiting for Sheltered Workshop Changeover." &lt;ref&gt;Weiner-Zivolich, J. &amp; Zivolich, S. (1995). If not now, when?: The case for waiting for sheltered workshop changeover. "JASH", 20(4): 311-312.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while full conversion has not occurred with growth also in adult day programs, new principles in employment have been promoted through the national APSE Network for Employment. These principles include quality indicators on individual choice and control of resources and supports.&lt;ref&gt;Rogan, P., Callahan, M., Griffin, C., &amp; Hammis, C. (2007). Toward full citizenship: New directions in employment for people with significant disabilities. In: P Walker &amp; P. Rogan, "Make the Day Matter: Promoting Typical Lifestyles for Adults with Significant Disabilities". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversion of sheltered workshops was recommended in the 1990s as part of the effort to shift financing and services to integrated settings.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, S. &amp; Rogan, P. (1995).  "Closing the Shop: From Sheltered to Integrated Work." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; State trends in "conversion" to integrated work have been monitored by the Institute for Inclusion in Boston and are available on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth, J., Gilmore, D., Kiernan, W., &amp; Schalock, R. (199). "State Trends in Employment Services for People with Developmental Disabilities." Boston, MA: Institute for Community Inclusion.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Local community rehabilitation agencies providing supported employment grew from just over 300 in 1986 to approximately 5,000 in 1993" (McCaughey et al., 1995). However, Wehman and Kregel (1995) indicated that supported employment was established in every state through Title III, Part C of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments in 1986; Gary Smith with Bob Gettings indicated all states were funded for supported employment under the Home and Community-Based Medicaid Waivers, too. Supported employment remains a viable employment option and operates side-by-side with segregated employment options within states in the US and involved 212,000 individuals with severe disabilities in 2002(Rusch &amp; Braddock, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Rusch, F. &amp; Braddock, D. (2004). Adult day programs versus supported employment (1988-2002): Spending and service practice of mental retardation and developmental disabilities agencies. "Research and Practice in Severe Disabilities", 29(4): 237-242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P. &amp; Kregel, J. (1995). At the crossroads: Supported employment: A decade later. "Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps", 20: 286-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Racino (1994) reported (conceptual schemes) that the changes required in areas termed "support services" require other than the traditional "organizational" or "systems change" strategies of professional education and training.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1994). Creating change in states, agencies and communities. In: V.J. Bradley, J.W. Ashbaugh, and B.C. Blaney, "Creating Individual Supports for People with Developmental Disabilities: A Mandate for Change on Many Levels". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a study involving herself, the VR system continued to revert to the 1970s "entry level" position as the agreed upon (employer-school-service provider)approach to personnel with high educational degrees and extensive work experiences (i.e., one size fits all) similar to parents of children with disabilities who might be in entry level jobs with high degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). "Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All". London: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These issues have been termed "attitudinal" problems or lowered expectations and aspirations for people with disabilities which may emanate from the employers, the public, or from the service workers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Yucker, H.E. (1993). "Attitudes toward the Employment of Persons with Disabilities". Ithaca, NY: Cornell University, School of Industrial and Labor Relations.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, traditional barriers schemas target the agency management and regulatory and legislative bodies as intransegient in modernization.

==Individual Placement Model (IPS)==
[[IPS Supported Employment]] helps people with severe mental illness work at regular jobs of their choosing. Although variations of supported employment exist, IPS (Individual Placement and Support) refers to the evidence-based practice of supported employment (as Annie Oakley explains, referring to "everything under the sun") as validated by new universities and medical centers involved in employment.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, G.R., Drake, R.F., &amp; Becker, D.R. (2012, February). Generalizability of the individual placement and support (IPS) model of supported employment outside the US. "World Psychiatry", 11(1): 32-39.&lt;/ref&gt; The model appears to be a variation of professional supported employment approaches, based on decades of research study and practice in the field of disabilities.

'''Characteristic of IPS Supported Employment'''
* It is an evidence-based practice
* IPS supported employment practitioners focus on client strengths
* Work can promote recovery and wellness
* Practitioners work in collaboration with state vocational rehabilitation
* It uses a multidisciplinary team approach
* Services are individualized and long-lasting
* The IPS approach changes the way mental health services are delivered

Another earlier model was termed the hybrid case management/supported employment model which was reported on by Carol Mowbray of the University of Michigan, who studied mental health services nationwide, as a WINS research and demonstration model.&lt;ref&gt;Mowbray, C., McCrohan, N. &amp; Bybee, D. (1995). Integrating vocational services into case management: implementation analysis of Project WINS. "Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation", 5: 89-101.&lt;/ref&gt; These models critique earlier models and goals such as zero reject and "linear models" and emphasize the comprehensive planning aspects of multi-agency "individual placements".

The New Hampshire-Dartmouth Psychiatric Research Center considers day treatment programs, often previously known as day habilitation programs in the community, and supported employment (totally community developed and rigorously tested outside the categorical psychiatric services) to be two kinds of comparative outpatient services. This research group, following others in the US, reaffirms that supported employment can improve outcomes such as integration.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, R.E., Becker, D.R., Biesanz, J.C., Torrey, W.C., McHugo, G.J. &amp; Wyzik, P. F. (1994). Rehabilitation day treatment vs. supported employment: I. vocational outcomes. "Community Mental Health Journal", 30(5): 519-532.&lt;/ref&gt; Day treatment is also a set of "educational, counseling, and family interventions" which may be used for children and youth per Krista Kutash of Florida's Research Center for Children with Emotional Needs (1996); whereas these "support services" may be applicable for adults, supported employment (SE) typically is an adult service and for youth transitioning to work settings.

By 2006, supported employment was part of a web-based certificate series with a new certificate for "supported competitive employment for individuals with mental illness" (Virginia Commonwealth University, 2006). Typically, the audience are service providers who offer vocational and supported employment services ("university technical assistance and training"); these services build upon both traditional funded vocational rehabilitation categories (e.g., work adjustment) and newer concepts of career development versus jobs and job placements.&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski, E., Turner, K.D., &amp; Hershenson, D.B. (1992). Career development and work adjustment of persons with disabilities: Theoretical perspectives and implications for transition. In: F. R. Rusch, L. Destefano, J. Chadsey-Rusch, L. A. Phelps, &amp; E. Szymanski, "Transition from School to Adult Life". (pp.391-406). Sycamore, IL: Sycamore Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and training==
Supported employment, commonly a community service in the fields of rehabilitation, has roots both in the university sector, the vocational rehabilitation state and regional offices, and in the categorical service system of intellectual and developmental disabilities (long-term services and supports). As early as the mid-1980s, supported employment was an accepted inservice training topic with extensive working papers, videotapes, presentations, case studies, written books and products,and very reputable network of university personnel, including in severe disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Inge, K., Barcus, M. &amp; Everson, J. (1988). Developing inservice training programs for supported employment personnel. In: P. Wehman &amp; M. S. Moon, "Vocational Rehabilitation and Supported Employment". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; As indicated above, university certificates have been available since the mid-2000s on the web, and even earlier from the university sector preonline courses (see, Racino, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2000). "Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support." Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Certification is highly recommended, and indeed in most "providing sectors" needs to be required as providers tend to self-certify only.&lt;ref&gt;DiLeo, D. &amp; Flippo, K. (1996). The road to certification in supported employment: Ensure professionality or reduce innovation? (pp. 80-82). In: D. DiLeo &amp; D. Langton, "Facing the Future: Best Practices in Supported Employment". St. Augustine, FL: Training Resource Network.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional rehabilitation programs expected all rehabilitation personnel education programs to prepare for integrative and competitive employment as early as the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Rusch, F. (1986). "Competitive Employment: Issues and Strategies". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early skills recommended were both generic professional helping skills (e.g., facilitator, motivator, coach) and specific employment-related skills for workers (e.g., job sharing, job coaching).&lt;ref&gt;Callahan, M. &amp; Bradley, V. (1997).  "Keys to the Workplace: Skills and Supports for People with Disabilities." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, exceptional skills are required and more (e.g., political, social, administrative, health-human services) for conversion of traditional day programs to integrated employment systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rucker, R. &amp; Browder, D.M. (1994, October). Conversion from sheltered to integrated employment. " Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation", 4(4): 255-264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laski, F. &amp; Shoultz, B. (1987, October). Supported employment: What about those in Medicaid-funded day treatment and day activity centers? "TASH Newsletter", 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Gold's Michael Callahan, after tackling the institutional populations (Marc Gold in the 1970s), was one of the 4 decade or more leaders to community employment supporting the provider sector.&lt;ref&gt;McLoughlin, C., Garner, J. B. &amp; Callahan, M.J. (1987). Ch. 1: Sheltered work environments? A dinosaur in our midst? "Getting Employed, Staying Employed". (pp. 3-6). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special populations===

====Brain injury====
Community services in head and brain injury took on a new priority in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;West, M. (1992). Vocational rehabilitation service issues for youth and young adults. ''Transmit TBI''. Richmond, VA: Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the first time, work and living options were explored in conjunction with the newly formed state associations of head injury administrators. These services were scientifically studied in states such as New York at their Buffalo and Syracuse university centers in the context of changing public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, J., Conley, R.W., Laski, F., &amp; Noble, F.A. (1990, Summer). Issues and problems in the treatment of head injury. "Journal of Disability Policy Studies", 1(2): 19-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional rehabilitation concept of return to work was also developed in depth at the university sector with the relatively new cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive remediation.&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P., Booth, M., Stallard, D., Mundy, A., Sherron, P., West, M &amp; Cifu, D. (1994). Return to work for persons with traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury: Three case studies. "International Journal of Rehabilitation Research", 17: 266-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mental health and intellectual disabilities====
While for categorical state and local NGOs, work and community employment was accepted relatively early on (1970s and 1980s) as possible but difficult in "severe mental illness", but changing the state-federal vocational rehabilitation system was considered more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Conley, R. W. &amp; Noble, J.H. Jr. (1999). Severe mental illness and the continuing evolution of the federal-state vocational rehabilitation program. "Journal of Disability Policy Studies", 10(1): 99-126.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, John Kregel at the International Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps, reported that individuals with severe mental retardation, autism, physical disabilities and other groups continue to compromise a small percentage of supported employment participants.&lt;ref&gt;Kregel, J. (1993). Current and future research in supported employment. "Supported Employment Policy and Systems Change". Richmond, VA: VCU-RRTC on Supported Employment. Presented at TASH Conference, Chicago, Illinois, November 5, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[systematic review]] investigated the effects of supported employment for adults with severe mental illness:

The limited available evidence suggests that supported employment is effective in improving a number of work-related outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness, though there appears to exist some overall risk of bias in terms of the quality of individual studies.&lt;ref name=Kin2013/&gt;

====Women and Supported Employment: Gender====
In addition, it was not until decades later that the complexity of gender and its role in the workforce (See, women's professions, and disability and gender) began to appear in the American literatures with special populations.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D., Cioffi, A., Yovanoff, P. &amp; Mank, D. (2000, April). Gender differences in supported employment. "Mental Retardation", 38(2): 89-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Countries==
"No matter whether they live in the most prosperous nations of the world or the least, people with disabilities are among the most economically disadvantaged groups in society." (Schriner, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Schriner, K. (2001). A disability studies perspective on employment issues and policies of disabled people: An international view. In: G. Albrecht, K.D. Seelman, &amp; M. Bury, "Handbook of Disability Studies". Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries around the globe use the terminology 'supported employment' and each one has its own definition. In 1995, Steven Byer who visited the US from the United Kingdom, authored a chapter on Real jobs and supported employment for a leading book, "Values and Visions" by the King's Fund Linda Ward (with Philpot).&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, S. (1995). Real jobs and supported employment. In: T. Philpot, Values and Vision: Changing Ideas for People with Learning Difficulties." Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that book, Britain's Ordinary Lives leader David Towell (with Beardshaw) cited the US supported employment in "Enabling [[Community Integration]]" to assist public authorities in the UK to move toward integration in community life.&lt;ref&gt;Towell, D. &amp; Beardshaw, V. (1991). "Enabling Community Integration: The Role of Public Authorities in Promoting an Ordinary Life for People with Learning Disabilities in the 1990s". London: King's Fund College.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the "Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation" (JVR) highlighted the status in the European Union, inclusive of Germany, Norway and the Scandinavian countries (e.g., Iceland, Denmark), and the United Kingdom. In particular, the European Union on Supported Employment is examining inclusion skills competencies.

Supported employment remains underdeveloped, in spite of its years of available direct university education and training to the provider, financing and regulatory sectors. In the US, the inquiry can and has been made to state and local governments: "Where are the successes?" based on the decades of infusion of funds, assistance, exemplars, for "state systems change".&lt;ref&gt;McGhaughey, M. &amp; Mank, D. (2000, April). State systems change in supported employment: Where are the successes? "Supported Employment Information Lines", 11(3): 1, 3, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation (JVR) celebrated its 20th Anniversary in 2011 under the leadership of Dr. Paul Wehman, and over 3,000 special education or inclusion teachers annually learn of new developments (e.g., social capital, ethnic and cultural issues, business and marketing, supported employment developments) at the International Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps (TASH) Annual Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Shafer, M. &amp; Quiroga, T. (1993, winter). Perspectives on transition among Hispanic and disabled youth. "Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation", 54-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stefan Doose of Germany (2012) indicates a new federal Inklusion program (2011 from 2018) which promotes transition from school to work, and from sheltered workshops direct to the labor markets.&lt;ref&gt;Doose, S. (2012). Supported employment in Germany. "Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation", 37(3): 195-202.&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain supported opportunities for Ordinary Lives, which included moving from day centres to supported employment as early as the late 1980s (Towell &amp; Beardshaw, 1991).&lt;ref&gt;Towell, D. &amp; Beardshaw, V. (1991). "Enabling Community Integration: The Role of Public Authorities in Promoting an Ordinary Life for People with Learning Difficulties in the 1990s". London: King's Fund College.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ([[UNCRPD]], 2006) supports the right to employment, among its articles ratified by over 100 countries and in the implementation stages.&lt;ref&gt;UN ENABLE. (2006). "United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities." Geneva, Switzerland: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria''' (or simply '''the Global Fund''') is an international [[financing]] organization that aims to “attract, leverage and invest additional resources to end the epidemics of [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[malaria]] to support attainment of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] established by the [[United Nations]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bylaws of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis &amp; Malaria |url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/6007/core_globalfund_bylaws_en.pdf |website=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |publisher=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[public–private partnership|public-private partnership]], the organization maintains its [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GFATM - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|url=https://www.dfae.admin.ch/deza/en/home/partnerships-mandates/partnerships-multilateral-organisations/weitere-organisationen-netzwerke/gfatm.html|website=Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation SDC|publisher=Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation SDC|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization began operations in January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GFATM - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|url=https://www.dfae.admin.ch/deza/en/home/partnerships-mandates/partnerships-multilateral-organisations/weitere-organisationen-netzwerke/gfatm.html|website=Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation SDC|publisher=Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation SDC|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] was one of the first private foundations among many bilateral donors to provide [[seed money]] for the partnership.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h6Ih8CYz1SqAKYjI-SiowJgu8BSA?docId=CNG.07d4a47a8ce76f0e07e322726bdf65a2.6f1 |archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20130124180843/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h6Ih8CYz1SqAKYjI-SiowJgu8BSA?docId=CNG.07d4a47a8ce76f0e07e322726bdf65a2.6f1 |archivedate=January 24, 2013 |title=AFP: Global Fund faces billion-dollar gap |publisher=Google.com |date=2011-05-19 |accessdate=2012-01-26 |first=Marlowe |last=Hood |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Fund is the world's largest financier of AIDS, TB, and malaria prevention, treatment, and care programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why The U.S. Is Pledging $4.3 Billion To The Global Fund|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/09/15/493760787/why-the-u-s-is-pledging-4-3-billion-to-the-global-fund|accessdate=23 May 2018|publisher=National Public Radio, Inc.|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2018, the organization had disbursed more than USD 38 billion to support these programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/financials|title=Financials|last=|first=|date=|website=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|publisher=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the organization, in 2017 it financed the distribution of 197 million [[Mosquito net|insecticide-treated nets]] to combat [[malaria]], provided anti-tuberculosis treatment for 5 million people, supported 17.5 million people on antiretroviral therapy for AIDS, and since its founding saved 27 million lives worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/7741/corporate_2018resultsreport_report_en.pdf|title=Results Report 2018|last=|first=|date=September 2018|website=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|publisher=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Global Fund is a financing mechanism rather than an implementing agency. Programs are implemented by in-country partners such as ministries of health, while the Global Fund secretariat, whose staff only have an office in Geneva, monitor the programs. Implementation is overseen by Country Coordinating Mechanisms, country-level committees consisting of in-country stakeholders that need to include, according to Global Fund requirements, a broad spectrum of representatives from government, NGOs, faith-based organizations, the private sector, and people living with the diseases. This system has kept the Global Fund secretariat smaller than other international bureaucracies. The model has also raised concerns about conflict of interest, as some of the stakeholders represented on the Country Coordinating Mechanisms may also receive money from the Global Fund, either as grant recipients, sub-recipients, private persons (e.g. for travel or participation at seminars) or contractors.

==Creation==
At the end of the 20th century, international political will to improve coordinated efforts to fight the world's deadliest infectious diseases began to materialize. Through various multilateral fora, consensus around creating a new international financial vehicle to combat these diseases emerged. In this context the [[World Health Organization]] called for a "Massive Attack on Diseases of Poverty" in December 1999.

In April 2001, in Abuja, Nigeria at a summit of African leaders, [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] made the first explicit public call by a highly visible global leader for this new funding mechanism, proposing "the creation of a Global Fund, dedicated to the battle against HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases."&lt;ref name="Kofi Annan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/statments_search_full.asp?statID=8 |title=Annan's call for a global AIDS war chest |publisher=United Nations |date=2001-04-26 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary General Annan made the first contribution to the Global Fund in 2001.

The G8 formally endorsed the call for the creation of the Global Fund at its summit in July 2001 in [[Genoa|Genoa, Italy]], although pledges were significantly lower than the USD 7 billion to USD 10 billion annually Kofi Annan insisted was needed.&lt;ref name="G8 Leaders Agree to Create AIDS Fund"&gt;{{cite web|last=Washington |first=The |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2001/jul/20/20010720-024354-4327r/print/ |title=G8 Leaders Agree to Create AIDS Fund |publisher=Washington Times |date=2001-07-20 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the G8’s final communique, “At Okinawa last year, we pledged to make a quantum leap in the fight against infectious diseases and to break the vicious cycle between disease and poverty.

By the time the Global Fund Secretariat became operational, the organization had received USD 1.9 billion in pledges.

In March 2002, a panel of international public health experts was named to begin reviewing project proposals that same month. In April 2002, the Global Fund awarded its first batch of grants – worth USD 378 million – to fight the three diseases in 31 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalhealthdelivery.org/case-collection/concept-notes/the-global-fund-to-fight-aids-tubercu|title=Concept Note: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising==
Since the Global Fund was created in 2002, public sector contributions have constituted 95 percent of all financing raised; the remaining 5 percent comes from the [[private sector]] or other financing initiatives such as [[Product Red]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/government/ |title=Government Donors - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |publisher=The Global Fund |date=2018-05-23 |accessdate=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Fund states that from 2002 to 2016, more than 51 donor governments pledged a total of USD 38.5 billion and paid USD 37.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/1119/core_pledgescontributions_list_en.xlsx |title=Pledges and Contributions - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |publisher=The Global Fund |date=2018-03-31 |accessdate=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 through 2016, the largest contributor by far has been the [[United States]], followed by [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/1119/core_pledgescontributions_list_en.xlsx |title=Pledges and Contributions - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |publisher=The Global Fund |date=2018-03-31 |accessdate=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The donor nations with the largest percent of [[gross national income]] contributed to the fund from 2008 through 2010 were [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], France, the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Spain]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Global Fund typically raises and spends funds during three-year "replenishment" fund-raising periods. Its first replenishment was launched in 2005, the second in 2007, the third in 2010, the fourth in 2013, and the fifth in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Replenishment Archive|url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/archive/replenishment/|publisher=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alarms were raised prior to the third replenishment meeting in October 2010 about a looming deficit in funding, which would have led to people undergoing ARV treatment losing access, increasing the chance of them becoming resistant to treatment. [[UNAIDS]] Executive Director [[Michel Sidibé]] dubbed the scenario of a funding deficit an "HIV Nightmare".&lt;ref&gt;Hellevik, Siri Bjerkrem: [http://blog.nibrinternational.no/#post20 "Is an HIV Nightmare on the Way?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624015615/http://blog.nibrinternational.no/ |date=2016-06-24 }} at ''the NIBR International Blog, August 23, 2010''&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Fund stated it needed at least USD 20 billion for the third replenishment (covering programs 2011-2013), and USD 13 billion just to "allow for the continuation of funding of existing programs."&lt;ref&gt;Hellevik, Siri Bjerkreim: ''HIV Nightmare Averted - For Now'', [http://blog.nibrinternational.no/#post22 NIBR International Blog, October 14, 2020] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624015615/http://blog.nibrinternational.no/ |date=June 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, USD 11.8 billion was mobilized at the third replenishment meeting, with the United States being the largest contributor - followed by France, Germany, and Japan. The Global Fund stated the USD 1.2 billion lack in funding would "lead to difficult decisions in the next three years that could slow down the effort to beat the three diseases."&lt;ref&gt;Hellevik, Siri Bjerkreim: H''IV Nightmare Averted - For Now'', [http://blog.nibrinternational.no/#post22 NIBR International Blog, October 14, 2020] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624015615/http://blog.nibrinternational.no/ |date=June 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the organization's board cancelled all new grants for 2012, only having enough money to support existing grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/12/01/143024108/obama-embraces-end-of-aids-promises-to-accelerate-hiv-treatment|title=Obama Embraces 'End of AIDS,' Promises To Accelerate HIV Treatment|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the Global Fund’s May 2012 board meeting, it announced that an additional USD 1.6 billion would be available in the 2012-2014 period for investment in programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/mediacenter/newsreleases/2012-05-09_Global_Fund_Forecasts_USD_1_6_billion_in_Available_Funds_for_2012_2014_Major_Shift_Reflects_Strategic_Choices_by_Board_Renewed_Confidence/ |title=Global Fund Forecasts $1.6 billion in Available Funds for 2012-2014 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the fourth replenishment meeting was held in Washington D.C.

The fifth replenishment meeting took place September 2016 in [[Montreal]], Canada, and was hosted by Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]]. Donors pledged USD 12.9 billion for the 2017-2019 period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global fund raises $12.9 billion to fight AIDS, TB and malaria|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-aids-fundraising-idUSKCN11N0PB|website=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
[[Richard Feachem]] was named the Global Fund's first executive director in April 2002&lt;ref name="Feachem named head of Global Fund"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthgap.org/press_releases/a02/042502_BG_FUND_ED.html |title=FUND: Executive Director Feecham, 4/25/02 |publisher=Healthgap.org |date=2002-04-25 |accessdate=2012-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928061453/http://www.healthgap.org/press_releases/a02/042502_BG_FUND_ED.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and faced early crticism from activists for stating the Global Fund has "plenty" of money to start.&lt;ref name="Disease-fighting group gets off to rocky start"&gt;Disease-fighting group gets off to rocky start, The Boston Globe, July 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feachem served from July 2002 through March 2007. Dr. [[Michel Kazatchkine]] was then selected as executive director over the Global Fund’s architect, [[David Nabarro]], even though Nabarro was “considered the strongest of three shortlisted candidates to head the Global Fund ... A selection committee has evaluated the three nominees' qualifications and ranked ‘Nabarro first, Kazatchkine second and (Alex) Cotinho third,’ according to a Fund source.”&lt;ref name="UN's Nabarro tipped to head global AIDS fund"&gt;UN's Nabarro tipped to head global AIDS fund, “Reuters Health Medical News,'' February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] called for Kazatchkine's resignation in the wake of isolated yet unprecedented reports of "waste, fraud, and corruption" in order that "reforms may begin in earnest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AHF: Global Fund Head Must Step Down to Ensure Fund’s Viability|url=http://www.aidshealth.org/news/press-releases/ahf-global-fund-head-must.html|publisher=AIDS Healthcare Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006065951/http://www.aidshealth.org/news/press-releases/ahf-global-fund-head-must.html|archivedate=2011-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, Kazatchkine ultimately declared his resignation, following the decision made by the Global Fund board in November 2011 to appoint a general manager, leaving Kazatchkine’s role to that of chief fund-raiser and public advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mcneil|first=Donald Jr. |title=Director Quits After Changes at Global Fund|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/health/global-funds-executive-director-steps-down.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communications later disclosed by the United States government stated that Kazatchkine's performance was deemed unsatisfactory by the Global Fund board, notably in relation to the funding of activities related to the First Lady of France at the time, [[Carla Bruni-Sarkozy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hillary Clinton Archives Reveal AIDS Fund Chief Pushed Out in 2012|url=http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hillary-clinton-archives-reveal-aids-fund-chief-pushed-out-in-2012-1238601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Kazatchkine’s resignation, the Global Fund announced the appointment of Gabriel Jaramillo, the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Sovereign Bank, to the newly created position of general manager. Jaramillo, who had retired one year earlier, had since served as a Special Advisor to the Office of the Special Envoy for Malaria of the Secretary General of the United Nations, and was a member of the high-level independent panel that looked at the Global Fund’s fiduciary controls and oversight mechanisms. Jaramillo reorganized and reduced Global Fund staff in response to the previous year's critics of the Global Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabriel Jaramillo, former General Manager of The Global Fund|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/voices/events/jaramillo/|website=Harvard T.H.

Dr. [[Mark Dybul|Mark R. Dybul]] was appointed executive director in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Fund Board Selects Mark Dybul to Be the Fund’s Next Executive Directo|url=http://www.aidspan.org/gfo_article/global-fund-board-selects-mark-dybul-be-fund%E2%80%99s-next-executive-director|website=Aidspan|publisher=Aidspan|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He previously served as the United States Global AIDS Coordinator, leading the implementation of the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) from 2006 to 2009. Dybul ended his appointment in 2017.

A nominating process to find a successor to Dybul ran into trouble in 2017 because nominees had spoken out against [[Donald Trump]] as a candidate for president of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/health/global-fund-aids-tuberculosis-malaria-director.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Health&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Fund board named Global Fund Chief of Staff Marijke Wijnroks of the Netherlands as interim executive director while the nominating process restarted. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ip-watch.org/2017/03/04/global-fund-names-interim-executive-director-starting-june/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
The Global Fund was formed as an independent, non-profit foundation under Swiss law and hosted by the [[World Health Organization]] in January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Fund Overview|url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/overview/|website=Wayback Machine|publisher=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|accessdate=22 November 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122071114/http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/overview/|archivedate=22 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, the organization became an administratively autonomous organization, terminating its administrative services agreement with the World Health Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Global Fund becomes an administratively autonomous institution as of 2009 |url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/news/2008-12-19-the-global-fund-becomes-an-administratively-autonomous-institution-as-of-2009/ |website=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |publisher=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial objective of the Global Fund — to provide funding to countries on the basis of performance — was supposed to make it different from other international agencies at the time of its inception. Other organizations may have staff that assist with the implementation of grants. However, the Global Fund's five-year evaluation in 2009 concluded that without a standing body of technical staff, the Global Fund is not able to ascertain the actual results of its projects.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} It has therefore tended to look at disbursements or the purchase of inputs as performance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} It also became apparent shortly after the organization opened that a pure funding mechanism could not work on its own, and it began relying on other agencies – notably the World Health Organization – to support countries in designing and drafting their applications and in supporting implementation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The [[United Nations Development Programme]], in particular, bears responsibility for supporting Global Fund-financed projects in a number of countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} As a result, the organization is most accurately described as a financial supplement to the existing global health architecture rather than as a separate approach.

The Global Fund Secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland, employs about 700 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Staff |url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/staff |website=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |publisher=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are neither offices nor staff based in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview |url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/overview |website=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |publisher=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Global Fund adopted a new way of distributing its funds in countries to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lopez Gonzalez |first1=Laura |title=A beginner’s guide to the Global Fund’s new funding model |url=http://www.makingmalariahistory.org/a-beginners-guide-to-the-global-funds-new-funding-model/ |website=Making Malaria History |publisher=Global Health Posts |accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this funding model, eligible countries receive an allocation of money every three years for possible use during same the three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Global Fund launches new funding model to support countries in responding to HIV, TB and malaria |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2013/march/20130301agfatm |accessdate=16 August 2017 |agency=The Global Fund launches new funding model to support countries in responding to HIV, TB and malaria |publisher=UNAIDS |date=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of all allocations across all countries depends on the amount contributed by governments and other donors through the "replenishment" fundraising during the same three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Global Fund's New Funding Model:What it Might Mean for You and Your Country |journal=Eurasian Harm Reduction Network |date=March 2013 |page=8 |url=http://ecom.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countries, through their “country coordinating mechanism” committees, submit applications outlining how they’ll use the allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Understanding the New Funding Model: An Aidspan Guide |date=30 April 2014 |page=7 |url=http://www.aidspan.org/sites/all/modules/custom/apw_zstatistic/publication_download.php?file=sites/default/files/publications/NFM_Guide.pdf |accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committees name entities, called “principal recipients,” to carry about programs within their respective countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Understanding the New Funding Model: An Aidspan Guide |date=30 April 2014 |page=8 |url=http://www.aidspan.org/sites/all/modules/custom/apw_zstatistic/publication_download.php?file=sites/default/files/publications/NFM_Guide.pdf |accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An independent "technical review panel" reviews the applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Global Fund's New Funding Model: Early Outcomes for Regional Civil Society Applicants |journal=ICASO |date=March 2014 |page=13 |url=http://icaso.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/erhnNewFundingModelweb.pdf |accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the applications are approved, the Global Fund provides funding to the principal recipients based on achievement toward agreed indicators and actual expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |title=Operational Policy Manual |date=7 March 2018 |url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/3266/core_operationalpolicy_manual_en.pdf |accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance and expenses are periodically reviewed by a “local fund agent,” which in most countries is an international financial audit company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rivers |first1=Bernard |title=What is a Local Fund Agent? |url=http://www.aidspan.org/gfo_article/what-local-fund-agent |website=Aidspan |publisher=Aidspan |accessdate=23 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption and misuse of funds==
In January 2011, the [[Associated Press]] reported vast corruption in some programs financed by the Global Fund, citing findings of the Global Fund Office of the Inspector General -- an auditing unit independent from the Global Fund Secretariat -- that up to two-thirds of funds in some of the reviewed grants were lost to fraud.&lt;ref name="ap-report" /&gt; The Office of the Inspector General report showed that systematic fraud patterns had been used across countries.&lt;ref name="ap-report" /&gt; The Global Fund responded to the story with a news release, stating, "The Global Fund has zero tolerance for corruption and actively seeks to uncover any evidence of misuse of its funds. It deploys some of the most rigorous procedures to detect fraud and fight corruption of any organization financing development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/mediacenter/newsreleases/2011-01-24_Gobal_Fund_statement_on_abuse_of_funds_in_some_countries/ |title=News Release: Global Fund statement on abuse of funds in some countries. |publisher=The Global Fund |date=January 24, 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830145403/http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/mediacenter/newsreleases/2011-01-24_Gobal_Fund_statement_on_abuse_of_funds_in_some_countries/ |archivedate=August 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Associated Press story, a number of op-eds, including one by [[Michael Gerson]] published in the Washington Post in February 2011, sought to put the controversy surrounding the misuse of Global Fund grants in perspective. Gerson stated, "The two-thirds figure applies to one element of one country's grant - the single most extreme example in the world. Investigations are ongoing, but the $34 million in fraud that has been exposed represents about three-tenths of 1 percent of the money the fund has distributed.

Previous reviews of grants and the Global Fund had shown substantial misconduct in some programs, lack of adequate risk management, and operational inefficiency of the Global Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/terg/evaluations/5year/ Summary Paper on the Five-Year Evaluation Synthesis Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210124517/http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/terg/evaluations/5year/ |date=2010-02-10 }}, 5-year review study paid by the GFATM pp13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of corruption had also been found in several African countries such as Mali, Mauritania, Djibouti, and Zambia.&lt;ref name="ap-report" /&gt;

Sweden, the Global Fund’s 11th biggest contributor at the time (2011), suspended its USD 85 million annual donation until the corruption problems were resolved.&lt;ref name="ap-report"/&gt; Germany, the third biggest contributor at the time, also blocked any financing until a special investigation was complete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmz.de/de/presse/aktuelleMeldungen/2011/januar/20110125_pm_10_globalerfonds/index.html Minister Niebel on Corruption at the GFATM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717125000/http://www.bmz.de/de/presse/aktuelleMeldungen/2011/januar/20110125_pm_10_globalerfonds/index.html |date=2011-07-17 }}, BMZ message, January 25, 2011 German only&lt;/ref&gt; Funding was eventually restored.

Other cases of abuse of funds, corruption and mismanagement in a series of grants forced the Global Fund to suspend or terminate the grants after such dealings became publicly known in Uganda, Zimbabwe, Philippines, and Ukraine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In February 2011, the Financial Times reported that the Global Fund board failed to act previously on concerns over accountability including on the conclusion of an external evaluation in 2009 that criticized the organization’s weak procurement practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jack |first1=Andrew |title=UN health fund to review practices |url=https://www.ft.com/content/bd2d513a-2fcd-11e0-91f8-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=4 June 2018 |agency=Financial Times |publisher=Financial Times |date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warnings of inadequate controls had also been reported periodically.&lt;ref&gt;A spoonful of ingenuity, The Economist, Jan. 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Financial Times also reported that its own review found that neither Global Fund staff nor “local fund agents” (the entities entrusted with audit-like tasks at the country level) had noticed the deficiencies reported by the inspector general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jack |first1=Andrew |title=UN health fund to review practices |url=https://www.ft.com/content/bd2d513a-2fcd-11e0-91f8-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=4 June 2018 |agency=Financial Times |publisher=Financial Times |date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Global Fund hired a chief risk officer, Cees Klumper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mungcal |first1=Ivy |title=Cees Klumper is Global Fund’s new chief risk officer |url=https://www.devex.com/news/cees-klumper-is-global-fund-s-new-chief-risk-officer-77852 |accessdate=27 March 2012 |agency=Devex |publisher=Devex |date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After pushing countries to reclaim stolen funds from the parties responsible and recovering only about half, the organization began in 2014 as a last resort reducing future grants by twice the amount of misappropriated funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nurith |first1=Aizenman |title=Meet The Repo Man For Global Health: Skim Off A Grant, He'll Make You Pay |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/02/09/466143083/meet-the-repo-man-for-global-health-skim-off-a-grant-hell-make-you-pay |accessdate=9 February 2016 |agency=National Public Radio |publisher=National Public Radio |date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2016, this resulted in USD 14.8 million of reductions (collectively) for Bangladesh, Guatemala, Nigeria and Sri Lanka.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}{{update-inline|date=March 2016}}

'''''The Kingdom''''' ([[Danish language|Danish]] title: '''''Riget''''') is an eight-episode [[Denmark|Danish]] [[television]] [[mini-series]], created by [[Lars von Trier]] in 1994, and co-directed by Lars von Trier and [[Morten Arnfred]]. It has been edited together into a five-hour [[film]] for distribution in the United Kingdom and United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The series is set in the [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] ward of [[Copenhagen]]'s [[Rigshospitalet]], the city and country's main [[hospital]], nicknamed "Riget". "Riget" means "the realm" or "the kingdom", and leads one to think of "dødsriget", the realm of the dead. The show follows a number of characters, both staff and patients, as they encounter bizarre phenomena, both human and [[supernatural]]. The show is notable for its wry humor, its muted [[Sepia tone|sepia]] colour scheme, and the appearance of a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of dishwashers with [[Down syndrome]] who discuss in intimate detail the strange occurrences in the hospital.

The first quartet of episodes ended with numerous questions unanswered, and in 1997, the cast reassembled to produce another group of four episodes, '''''Riget II''''' ('''''The Kingdom II''''').{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

This second series ended with even more questions unanswered than the first, and a third series was planned. However, due to the death in 1998 of [[Ernst-Hugo Järegård]] (who played Stig Helmer) and the subsequent death of [[Kirsten Rolffes]] (who played Mrs Drusse) in 2000, the likelihood of a third series is now very remote.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Von Trier actually wrote the third and final season, but the production was not picked up by [[Danmarks Radio|DR]]. At that point, five regular cast members had died and it seemed impossible to continue the series. The abandoned scripts were sent to the producers of Stephen King's ''[[Kingdom Hospital]]'', but it is unclear whether they used the scripts or not.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Despite being a mini-series, ''The Kingdom'' appears as one of the ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]''.

==Production==
Von Trier has credited ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and the 1965 French miniseries ''[[Belphegor, or Phantom of the Louvre (1965 miniseries)|Belphegor]]'' as inspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/all-stitched-up-well-nearly-1527519.html|title=All stitched up - well, nearly|first=Adam|last=Mars-Jones|date=28 December 1995|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{cleanup rewrite|the section's poor development|date=December 2015}}

Each episode of ''Riget'' and ''Riget II'' begins with the same prologue, detailing how the hospital, [[Rigshospitalet]] in [[Copenhagen]], was built on the site of the "bleaching ponds", which recur in the name of the street of the hospital's official address, Blegdamsvej, although the exact significance of the reference is never explicitly discussed in the series.

The show begins with the admission of a [[spiritualist]] [[patient]], Sigrid Drusse, who hears the sound of a girl crying in the [[elevator]] shaft. Upon investigation, Drusse discovers that the girl had died decades earlier, having been killed by her father to hide her illegitimacy. In order to put the spirit to rest, Drusse searches for the girl's body and ultimately finds it preserved in a specimen jar in the office of the hospital's professor of pathology, Professor Bondo ([[Baard Owe]]).

Meanwhile, [[neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] Stig Helmer, a recent appointee from [[Sweden]] to the neurosurgery department, tries to cover up his responsibility for a botched operation which left a young girl in a [[persistent vegetative state]].

[[Pathology|Pathologist]] Dr. Bondo attempts to convince the family of a man dying from [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] to donate his liver to the hospital for Bondo's research. (In fact, Bondo wants it as a trophy, as it is the second largest hepatosarcoma ever recorded.)  When his request is denied, Bondo has the cancerous liver [[Organ transplant|transplant]]ed into his own body (as the patient signed an [[organ donation|organ donor]] form), so that the cancer will become his personal property and can be kept within the hospital.

Amongst other plotlines, a young medical student becomes attracted to the nurse in charge of the sleep research laboratory, a ghostly ambulance appears and disappears every night, a junior doctor runs a [[black market]] in medical supplies, and a neurosurgeon discovers that she was impregnated by a ghost and that the baby in her [[womb]] is developing abnormally rapidly. In every episode, two dishwashers (each with [[Down syndrome]]) in the cellar discuss the strange happenings at Riget, and Stig Helmer screams his famous catchphrase: ''Danskjävlar'' (subtitled as "Danish scum", but "Danish bastards" or even "Danish assholes" might be nearer in meaning{{cn|date=March 2018}}).

==Stephen King's ''Kingdom Hospital''==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
{{main|Kingdom Hospital}}
[[United States|American]] [[Horror fiction|horror]] writer [[Stephen King]] developed a 13-episode mini-series based on ''Riget'', under the title '''''Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital''''', which was broadcast in 2004. The plot retained many of the elements of ''Riget'', transferring the location of the hospital to [[Lewiston, Maine]] and placing it on the site of a mill built before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Many of the characters derived their names from the [[Denmark|Danish]] original (e.g., Sigrid Drusse became Sally Druse and Stig Helmer became Dr. Stegman). A significant difference in the American series was the introduction of a talking [[giant anteater]] character in the role of spirit guide/death/Anubis/Antubis.

==History==
In 1957 there was a nursing shortage so William R. Willard, the dean of the Albert b. Chandler Medical Center, suggested a college of nursing. The UK College of Nursing was then founded in 1960. Marcia Dake, EdD, RN was the first dean of the college.  Marcia was then joined with three other women to help teach the college. The first undergraduate class consisted of 35 women and they graduated in 1964. A [[Master of Science in Nursing]] program was added in 1969, followed by a [[PhD in nursing]] program in 1987. In 2001 the college established the nation's first [[Doctor of Nursing Practice]] program, which eventually led to a discontinuation of the masters program. Lastly, in 2010 the college celebrated its 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/nursing/about-us/welcome-college-nursing/history |title=History &amp;#124; College of Nursing |publisher=Uky.edu |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3375">The '''WIN Party''' was a small political party in [[New Zealand]].

It was founded by a group of [[public house|publican]]s and [[bar (establishment)|bar-owners]] who objected to the government's [[smoking ban|ban on smoking]] in bars and restaurants, introduced in December 2004. WIN's slogan was "Freedom of Choice", and the party said that it was fighting a growing trend in which "the average Kiwi ... is being told more and more what they can and can't do". According to the party's leaders, opposition to the smoking ban was the party's primary campaign plank, but other related issues were also given attention.

WIN's leader was [[John van Buren (New Zealand)|John van Buren]], a publican from the [[Banks Peninsula]] area. Geoff Mulvihill, a publican from [[Timaru]], was the deputy leader. Both van Buren and Mulvihill have been accused by the Ministry of Health of not enforcing the smoking ban, as required by law. Mulvihill is known for supporting freedom of choice for his patrons, having once lost his liquor licence for operating around the clock prior to the legislation of 24-hour trading.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_661073"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/661073 |title=Publican claims victimisation |date=15 February 2006 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10360062"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bars/news/article.cfm?c_id=687&amp;objectid=10360062 |title=Publican 'blatantly flouted' law against smoking |author=Jarrod Booker |date=15 December 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party had been given official registration, but chose not to field candidates in the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 elections]]. Instead, it endorsed the larger [[United Future New Zealand|United Future]] party, and van Buren stood as a candidate on United Future's party list, where he was ranked 55th out of 57.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2005/e9/html/e9_part3_1.html|title=Party Lists of Successful Registered Parties|website=electionresults.govt.nz|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As United Future received only three seats in Parliament at that election, van Buren was not elected. 

The party published the results of a survey showing that while city bars had suffered little damage from the ban on patrons choosing to smoke, suburban and rural establishments had been hard hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/prosmoking-nz-publican-fined-in-test-case/2005/12/16/1134703597110.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Pro-smoking NZ publican fined in test case | date=16 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WIN was deregistered in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.org.nz/news/cancel-party-regi.html Cancellation of party registration | Elections New Zealand&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Database of Happiness''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a web-based archive of research findings on subjective appreciation of life. The database contains both an overview of scientific publications on happiness and a digest of research findings.&lt;ref&gt;Veenhoven, R. (2004) World database of happiness; Continuous register of research on subjective appreciation of life. Published in: Glatzer, W., VonBelow, S. &amp; Stoffregen, M. (eds.), ‘Challenges for quality of life in the contemporary world: Advances in quality-of-life studies, theory and research’, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht The Netherlands, Social Indicators Research Series, vol. 24, {{ISBN|1-4020-2890-3}} (e-book 1-4020-2903-9).&lt;/ref&gt; The database contains information on how happy people are in a wide range of circumstances and in 165 different nations.&lt;ref&gt;Veenhoven, R. (2011) World database of happiness; Example of a focused ‘Findings Archive’. Published as Working paper No. 169, German Data Forum RatSWD, February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Happiness is defined as the degree to which an individual judges the quality of his or her life as a whole favorably. Two 'components' of happiness are distinguished: hedonic level of affect (the degree to which pleasant affect dominates) and contentment (perceived realization of wants).

==Aims==
The World Database of Happiness is a tool to acquire an overview on the ever-growing stream of research findings on happiness. The accumulation of knowledge stagnates if scientists do not capitalize on earlier research investments.&lt;ref&gt;Veenhoven, R. (2009) World database of happiness. Psychological Topics, 18: 221-246.&lt;/ref&gt; Medio 2013 the database covered some 19,000 scientific findings on happiness, of which about 6000 are distributional findings (on how happy people are) and another 13,000 correlational findings (on what is associated with more and less happiness).&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first findings date from 1915.

==Popular use==
The World Database of Happiness is often used by popular media to make lists of the happiest countries around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gfmag.com/tools/global-database/ne-data/11940-happiest-countries.html#axzz2VQh2jLfD&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Happy Planet Index]], which aims to chart sustainable happiness all over the world by combining data on [[longevity]], [[happiness]] and the size of the [[ecological footprint]] of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.happyplanetindex.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths and weaknesses==
The database has a clear conceptual focus, it includes only research findings on subjective enjoyment of one’s life as a whole. Thereby it evades the Babel that has haunted the study of happiness for ages. The other side of that coin is that much interesting research is left out. The findings are reported with technical details about measurement and statistical analysis. This detail is welcomed by scholars, but makes the information difficult to digest for lay-persons. Still another limitation is that the available findings are often contradictory, which makes it hard to draw firm conclusions about the causes of happiness. What is clear is that poor health, separation, unemployment and lack of social contact are all strongly negatively associated with unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, P., Peasgood, T. &amp; White, M. (2008). Do we really know what makes us happy? A review of the economic literature on the factors associated with subjective well-being. Journal of Economic Psychology, 29, 94-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem for the World database of happiness is that the number of studies on happiness increases with such a high rate that it gets increasingly difficult to offer a complete overview of all research findings.
