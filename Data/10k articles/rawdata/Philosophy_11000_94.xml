'''Arthur Aston Luce''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MC}} (21 August 1882 &amp;ndash; 28 June 1977) was professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], and also [[Precentor]] of [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]] (1952–1973). Luce held many clerical appointments, including Vice-Provost of Trinity from 1946 to 1952. He was widely known as an authority on the philosopher [[George Berkeley]]. His fellowship of Trinity College from 1912 to 1977 is a record.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Life==

===Schooling===

Luce was born in [[Gloucester]] on 21 August 1882. He was the fourth son of the Reverend [[John James Luce]] and Alice Luce (née Stubbs). He was educated at Lindley Lodge School and Eastbourne College. He entered [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in 1901. He obtained his BA in 1905, BD in 1908 and MA in 1911.

===Early academic work===
Luce's earlier work focuses largely on theological matters within Christianity. His academic career was interrupted by World War I, in which he served with the 12th [[Royal Irish Rifles]]. He was awarded the [[Military Cross]] in 1917. After the war, he published "Monophysitism Past and Present" (1921) which deals with the nature of [[Jesus]] and his relationship to the world. The following year, he published his [[Donnellan Lectures]] on [[Henri Bergson]] where he examined issues in psychology and evolution as well as religion.

===Work on Berkeley===
From the 1930s, Luce became interested in the Irish philosopher [[George Berkeley]]. Luce felt many of the previous studies of Berkeley were in many ways inadequate and sometimes wrong. His unearthing of new sources on Berkeley as well as better ways of interpreting existing sources guided Luce's work in this direction. Luce stressed the role of the French monk [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] on influencing the thought of the young Berkeley. Prior to Luce's ''Berkeley and Malebranche'' (1934) Berkeley had been seen almost solely in the patrimony of [[John Locke]] and [[empiricism]].

Berkeley's mature philosophy was given lucid exposition by Luce in his 1945 work "Berkeley's Immaterialism". Along with [[Thomas Edmund Jessop]] &lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/tbettch/ Bettcher, Talia Mae] (Ph.D., California State University) [http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/tbettch/Jessop%20Thomas%20Edmund.pdf JESSOP, Thomas Edmund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528020703/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/tbettch/Jessop%20Thomas%20Edmund.pdf |date=28 May 2010 }} - In: Dictionary of Twentieth Century British Philosophers. Ed by S. Brown. Thoemmes Continuum, 2005. Pp. 474-475.&lt;/ref&gt; he edited ''The Works of George Berkeley'' (in nine volumes, 1948–1957).

Luce was not only a Berkeley scholar but came to be a believer in Berkelianism itself. In "Sense without Matter" (1954) Luce attempts to bring Berkeley up to date by modernising the philosophers vocabulary and putting the issues Berkeley faced in today's terms. In this work, Luce also treats of the Biblical account of matter (or rather the lack of such an account) and the psychology of perception and nature.

Berkeley's personal reputation among historians and the public was also an area which Luce felt needed correcting and updating. Some studies of Berkeley had contributed to his reputation as a dreamer or a loner who often hid his real views. Luce's "Life of George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne" (1949) takes aim at this picture of Berkeley and by careful use of (often new) sources paints a more grounded picture of the man.

==Personal life==
In 1918, Luce married Lilian Mary Thomson with whom he had three children. Tragically, his wife and young daughter drowned in 1940. His elder son Professor [[John Victor Luce]](1920-2011) was also a academic at Trinity and also served as Vice-Provost. His original academic work and numerous administrative and clerical appointments earned him a solid local and international reputation. He was regarded as a fine preacher and respected tutor. His hobbies were chess and particularly angling on which he wrote a book ("Fishing and Thinking" 1959) which is regarded highly among anglers: to his freshmen philosophy students, he would muse, "fishing and philosophy: trout and truth!" He died, shortly after an assault, on  28 June 1977.

'''Alloenzymes''' (or also called '''allozymes''') are variant forms of an [[enzyme]] which differs structurally but not functionally from other allozymes coded for by different [[alleles]] at the same [[Locus (genetics)|locus]]. These are opposed to [[isozyme]]s, which are enzymes that perform the same function, but which are coded by genes located at different loci.&lt;ref name="Devlin Biochemistry"&gt;{{cite web |title=Allozyme Electrophoresis and Population Structure in the Snowy Campion |url=http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bsci111b/allozymes/supplemental.htm |accessdate=15 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617204344/http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bsci111b/allozymes/supplemental.htm |archive-date=2013-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alloenzymes are common biological [[enzyme]]s that exhibit high levels of functional [[evolutionary conservation]] throughout specific [[Phylum|phyla]] and [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s. They are used by [[phylogeneticist]]s as molecular markers to gauge evolutionary histories and relationships between different species. This can be done because allozymes do not have the same structure. They can be separated by [[capillary electrophoresis]]. However, some species are monomorphic for many of their allozymes which would make it difficult for phylogeneticists to assess the evolutionary histories of these species.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Patricia G. ''et al.'' (March 1998). "What Molecules Can Tell Us About Populations: Choosing and Using a Molecular Marker". ''Ecology'' '''79''' (2): 361–382.&lt;/ref&gt; In these instances, phylogeneticists would have to use another method to determine the evolutionary history of a species.

These enzymes generally perform very basic functions found commonly throughout all lifeforms, such as [[DNA polymerase]], the enzyme that repairs and copies [[DNA]]. Significant changes in this enzyme reflect significant events in evolutionary history of organisms. As expected DNA polymerase shows relatively small differences in its [[amino acid]] sequence between phyla and even kingdoms.

The key to choosing which alloenzyme to use in a comparison between multiple species is to choose one that is as variable as possible while still being present in all the organisms. By comparing the amino acid sequence of the enzyme in the species, more amino acid similarities should be seen in species that are more closely related, and fewer between those that are more distantly related. The less well conserved the enzyme is, the more amino acid differences will be present in even closely related species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ableweb.org/volumes/vol-19/2-bader.pdf |title=Measuring Genetic Variability in Natural Populations by Allozyme Electrophoresis |last1=Bader |first1=James M. |publisher=Association for Biology Laboratory Education |accessdate=14 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033716/http://www.ableweb.org/volumes/vol-19/2-bader.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrei Marga''' ({{IPA-ro|anˈdrej ˈmarɡa}}; born  22 May 1946) is a [[Romania]]n philosopher, political scientist, and politician. Rector – for the second time – of the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] in [[Cluj-Napoca]], he was a member of the [[Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (Romania)|Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party]] (PNŢCD), serving as [[Ministry of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Minister of Education]] in the [[Romanian Democratic Convention|Democratic Convention]] (CDR) coalition governments of [[Victor Ciorbea]], [[Radu Vasile]], and [[Mugur Isărescu]] (1997-2000). In January 2001, he replaced [[Ion Diaconescu]] as PNŢCD chairman, but resigned from his post in July 2001, amid political tensions in the party. He formed a new party, the Popular Christian Party later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;Alan J. Day, Roger East, Richard Thomas, ''A Political and Economic Dictionary of Eastern Europe'', Europa Publications, London, 2002. p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he affiliated with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL).

Marga has authored a large number of volumes on [[political science]], [[political philosophy]], and the [[philosophy of history]]. His work touches a variety of subjects, including the philosophical theories of [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]], the nature of [[positivism]], and trends in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref name="diaconu"&gt;{{Ro icon}} Mădălina Diaconu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=13330&amp;print=true "Premiile Herder 2005"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]''; retrieved August 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He has also lectured on specific subjects, such as the philosophic foundations of transition from [[communism]] to a [[market economy]], and the evolution of principles guiding [[European integration]].&lt;ref name="diaconu"/&gt; In later works, he approached topics pertaining to the [[philosophy of religion]], and to the status of religion in the age of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="diaconu"/&gt; In 2005, Andrei Marga received the [[Herder Prize]] in recognition of his contributions.&lt;ref name="diaconu"/&gt;

Marga was born in [[Bucharest]], attended the [[University of Cluj]] and also had a one-year scholarship at the [[University of Freiburg]] (West Germany).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaker and Presenter Biographies|url=http://archive.unu.edu/globalization/2007/bio.html|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusiv Documente: Andrei Marga de la activist A.S.C. plătit de PCR la ministru liberal în Guvernul Ponta|url=http://www.napocanews.ro/2012/07/documente-andrei-marga-de-la-activist-a-s-c-platit-de-pcr-la-ministru-liberal-in-guvernul-ponta-foto.html|accessdate=3 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130113193933/http://www.napocanews.ro/2012/07/documente-andrei-marga-de-la-activist-a-s-c-platit-de-pcr-la-ministru-liberal-in-guvernul-ponta-foto.html|archivedate=13 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, he became the rector of the Babeş-Bolyai University, of Cluj-Napoca.

As minister, Andrei Marga promoted [[Education in Romania|educational system]] [[Education reform|reform]], stressing that the communist legacy had contributed to a rise in [[political corruption]], and indicating that Romanian education lacked staples of [[professionalism]] such as underlined purposes, standards in [[Professional certification|certification]], and [[evaluation]] criteria.&lt;ref name="Daun &amp; Săpătoru, p.171"&gt;Daun &amp; Săpătoru, p.171&lt;/ref&gt; Marga also criticized the system for relying on "original features" and "Romanian traditions", which had been explained as a means to promote national development, but, in effect, had contributed to the gap between Romania and the Western world.&lt;ref name="Daun &amp; Săpătoru, p.171"/&gt; He called for [[modernization]], and defined his goals as "increasing the links between education and the economic, administrative and cultural environment, improving the educational infrastructure, eliminating [[paternalism]] and [[populism]] from educational [[management]], and enhancing international cooperation in education".&lt;ref name="Daun &amp; Săpătoru, p.171"/&gt;

The program was criticized by the political opposition, who argued that the system in place was satisfactory, and blamed the existing problems on the post-1989 political and social climate.&lt;ref&gt;Daun &amp; Săpătoru, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, supporters of reform were dissatisfied with its slow pace and inadequate financing.&lt;ref&gt;Daun &amp; Săpătoru, p.171-172&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1998, a controversy erupted in Romanian politics, after the CDR announced that it was planning to stand by the plan to set up separate universities for the [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Hungarian minority]].&lt;ref name="survey1998"&gt;Matyas Szabó, "Romania. The perils of Coalition politics", in Peter Rutland, ''Annual Survey of Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union 1998'', M.E. Sharpe, Armonk, 2000, p.265. {{ISBN|0-7656-0360-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was in turn based on a promise made to their coalition partner, the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]].&lt;ref name="survey1998"/&gt; In this context, Marga took the middle ground, saying that he supported separate [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-language]] sections but not separate institutions (a similar view was expressed by the CDR's other coalition partner, the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]]).&lt;ref name="survey1998"/&gt;

Marga joined the PNŢCD in 1999, and became its leader two years later. Party rules prohibited members with less than five years in the party from running for party president. During the party's congress, a few candidates resigned in support of Marga and the party's constitution was amended to allow Marga to run. Marga defeated his [[Conservatism|conservative]] opponents with the support of the congress in spite of opposition from the party hierarchy. He was brought in to reform the party and position it to recover from the losses of the [[Romanian legislative election, 2000|December 2000 election]]. His [[tenure]] failed to bring in the rapid changes desired and opposition from prominent conservative elements in his party stifled his ideas. He resigned in July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Lavinia Stan, "From Riches to Rags: The Romanian Christian Democrat Peasant Party", in ''East European Quarterly'', Vol. 39, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Marga joined the PNŢCD's former coalition partner, the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]]. From May to August 2012, Marga served as Foreign Minister in the government of [[Victor Ponta]].

The '''''Châtelaine de Vergi''''' or '''''Chastelaine de Vergi''''' is an anonymously-written short 13th century [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] of [[courtly love]] in [[Old French]].

==Overview==
The poem consists of approximately 958 lines of verse in 8 syllable rhymed couplets. The work is in the same poetic form as the majority of medieval French ''romans'', although significantly shorter than the romances of [[Chrétien de Troyes]]).  The work has come down to us in 20 manuscripts, though manuscripts C and G are the ones most commonly referred to, with the Folio Classiques edition using the former, which has 958 lines, and the Livre de Poche edition using the latter of 965 verses.  The oldest extant version was written in the late 13th Century, in approximately 1288, and the presumed date for the composition of the work is the first half of that century.  Some critics believe that the romance (other than the ending) is a ''[[roman à clef]]'' and that elements are based on true events.

The ''Châtelaine de Vergy'' was apparently very popular in courtly circles.  There exists as well a 15th-century prose version of the tale, and the plot was reused by [[Marguerite de Navarre]] in one of her ''[[Heptameron]]'' short stories (tale LXX). There are also multiple examples of the tale being portrayed in art, including various chests depicting scenes from the poem.

Whether or not the text is part of the Courtly Love tradition has been widely debated, especially given Gaston de Paris and C.S. Lewis' definitions of the concept.

==Plot==

The ''Châtelaine de Vergy'' tells the story of an unnamed knight in the service of the Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] who is the lover of the Châtelaine of Vergy, the Duke's niece.  The Châtelaine has accepted this knight's love on one condition: that he must keep their relationship secret from everyone, and that when he comes to visit her, he must wait for her little dog to come out to him in the garden, which signals that she is alone and the knight may come see her. 

When the Duchess of Burgundy falls in love with the knight, he is forced to spurn her advances, citing his loyalty to the Duke and his love for another.  In her anger, the duchess then tells her husband that the knight is unfaithful and has tried to seduce her, and the Duke accuses the knight of treachery.  To save his honor, and to avoid being exiled (and thus forced to distance himself from his mistress), the knight, once the lord has promised to keep his secret, reveals to his lord where his heart truly lies, thus violating his promise to his mistress.

The Duke reveals the truth of the knight's love to his wife, trusting her to keep the secret; but, at the feast of ''[[Pentecost|Pentecoste]]'', the Duchess makes a cruel inside joke to the Châtelaine about her lover and her "well-trained dog".  The Châtelaine realizes her lover has not kept his promise and she dies in despair.  The knight discovers her body and kills himself.  The Duke finds both bodies, and exacts vengeance on his wife by killing her with the knight's sword, and then becomes a [[Knights Templar|knight Templar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4954">The '''Collège international de philosophie''' ('''Ciph'''), located in [[Paris]]' [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]], is a tertiary education institute placed under the trusteeship of the French government department of research and chartered under the French 1901 Law on associations. It was co-founded in 1983 by [[Jacques Derrida]], [[François Châtelet]], [[Jean-Pierre Faye]] and [[Dominique Lecourt]] in an attempt to re-think the teaching of philosophy in France, and to liberate it from any institutional authority (most of all from the [[University]]). Its financing is mainly through public funds.&lt;ref name="Public Funds"&gt;“The CIPh is living mainly on grants by the Ministry of Research and the Ministry of Education”  {{cite web | url=http://www.ciph.org/college.php?rub=partenaires | title=CIPh financial partners (on the CIPh site) | accessdate=May 19, 2012 | author=CIPh|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its chairs or "directors of program" are competitively elected for 6 years (non renewable), following an international open call for proposals (every third year). Proposals are free and directors are elected after a collegial, peer-assessment of their value for philosophy. The College recognizes that philosophy is better served by being located at "intersections" such as Philosophy/Science, or Philosophy/Law. Proposals must respond to this exigency of "intersection" as wished by Jacques Derrida. The College has few registered students, who may receive the ''Diplôme du Collège international de philosophie'', which is not a university degree but may be, in some cases, validated by French or foreign universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci-philo.asso.fr/C-activi.asp Les activités - haut et bas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010212145650/http://www.ci-philo.asso.fr/C-activi.asp |date=2001-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, attendance to seminars is open and free.

== Raison d'être ==

According to Derrida, he was inspired by the Cerisy study center to found this new institution, in the midst of governmental threats on the teaching of philosophy in the last class of high school. Thus was created this College, "from a non-governmental origin, with an international span, an institution which is not destined to oppose itself, but to balance, question, open, occupy margins ; where we would privilege infrequent approaches or approaches yet unlegitimized by the university, new objects, new themes, new fields; where we would treat more of intersections than of academic disciplines".&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Derrida: "{{lang|fr|d’origine non gouvernementale, à portée internationale, une institution qui n’est pas destinée à s’opposer, mais à équilibrer, à questionner, à ouvrir, à occuper les marges ; où l’on privilégie des approches peu fréquentes ou point encore légitimées dans l’université, de nouveaux objets, de nouveaux thèmes, de nouveaux champs ; où l’on traite des intersections plus que des disciplines académiques}}" [http://www.fondationlaposte.org/article.php3?id_article=749 Interview with Derrida] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617090256/http://fondationlaposte.org/article.php3?id_article=749 |date=2006-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''commentary of a philosophical text''' is the analysis of a philosophical text that is undertaken from different angles and points of view, and that enables the study of its nature and characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Frank. (1998). From Metaphysics to Ethics: A Defense of Conceptual Analysis. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentary has been a very important and useful tool. A large portion of the philosophical schools was originated through the analysis that different commentarists carried out of renowned philosophical texts. In [[ancient Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], renowned [[schools of thought]] were started by commenting on texts from [[Plato]] and [[Aristoteles]]. A significant portion of [[Thomas Aquinas]] philosophical ideas were the result of commentaries to some of Aristoteles ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, E. &amp; Laurence, S. (2006). "Concepts". The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

The commentary of philosophical text tracks its roots to the importance and relevance that philosophy assigns to the analysis of the language and the interpretation of texts.

In [[logic]], and especially in its applications to [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]], a '''counterexample''' is an exception to a proposed general rule or law. For example, consider the proposition "all students are lazy". 
Because this statement makes the claim that a certain property (laziness) holds for ''all'' students, even a ''single'' example of a diligent student will prove it false.
Thus, any hard-working student is a counterexample to "all students are lazy".
More precisely, a counterexample is a specific instance of the falsity of a [[universal quantification]] (a "for all" statement).

In mathematics, this term is (by a slight abuse) also sometimes used for examples illustrating the necessity of the full hypothesis of a theorem, by considering a case where a part of the hypothesis is not verified, and where one can show that the conclusion does not hold.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==In mathematics==
In mathematics, counterexamples are often used to prove the boundaries of possible theorems. By using counterexamples to show that certain conjectures are false, mathematical researchers avoid going down blind alleys and learn how to modify conjectures to produce provable theorems.

===Rectangle example===
Suppose that a mathematician is studying [[geometry]] and [[shape]]s, and she wishes to prove certain theorems about them. She [[conjecture]]s that "All [[rectangles]] are [[Square (geometry)|squares]]". She can either attempt to [[Mathematical proof|prove]] the truth of this statement using [[deductive reasoning]], or if she suspects that her conjecture is false, she might attempt to find a counterexample. In this case, a counterexample would be a rectangle that is not a square, like a rectangle with two sides of length 5 and two sides of length 7. However, despite having found rectangles that were not squares, all the rectangles she did find had four sides. She then makes the new conjecture "All rectangles have four sides". This is weaker than her original conjecture, since every square has four sides, even though not every four-sided shape is a square.

The previous paragraph explained how a mathematician might weaken her conjecture in the face of counterexamples, but counterexamples can also be used to show that the assumptions and [[hypothesis]] are needed. Suppose that after a while the mathematician in question settled on the new conjecture "All shapes that are rectangles and have four sides of equal length are squares". This conjecture has two parts to the hypothesis: the shape must be 'a rectangle' and 'have four sides of equal length' and the mathematician would like to know if she can remove either assumption and still maintain the truth of her conjecture. So she needs to check the truth of the statements: (1) "All shapes that are rectangles are squares" and (2) "All shapes that have four sides of equal length are squares". A counterexample to (1) was already given, and a counterexample to (2) is a non-square [[rhombus]]. Thus the mathematician sees that both assumptions were necessary.

===Other mathematical examples===
{{See also|Counterexamples in topology|Minimal counterexample}}

A counterexample to the statement "all [[prime number]]s are [[Parity (mathematics)|odd numbers]]" is the number 2, as it is a prime number but is not an odd number. Neither of the numbers 7 or 10 is a counterexample, as neither contradicts the statement. In this example, 2 is the only possible counterexample to the statement, but only a single example is needed to contradict "''All'' prime numbers are odd numbers". Similarly the statement "All [[natural number]]s are either [[Prime number|prime]] or [[Composite number|composite]]" has the number 1 as a counterexample as 1 is neither prime nor composite.

[[Euler's sum of powers conjecture]] was disproved by counterexample. It asserted that at least ''n'' ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; powers were necessary to sum to another ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power. The conjecture was disproved in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lander, Parkin|year=1966|title=Counterexample to Euler's conjecture on sums of like powers|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|publisher=Americal Mathematical Society|volume=72|page=1079|issn=0273-0979|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1966-72-06/S0002-9904-1966-11654-3/S0002-9904-1966-11654-3.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a counterexample involving ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5; other ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 counterexamples are now known, as are some ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 counterexamples.

[[Witsenhausen's counterexample]] shows that it is not always true for [[control theory|control problems]] that a quadratic [[loss function]] and a linear equation of evolution of the [[state variable]] imply optimal control laws that are linear.

Other examples include the disproofs of the [[Seifert conjecture]], the [[Pólya conjecture]], the conjecture of [[Hilbert's fourteenth problem]], [[Tait's conjecture]], and the [[Ganea conjecture]].

==In philosophy==

In [[philosophy]], counterexamples are usually used to argue that a certain philosophical position is wrong by showing that it does not apply in certain cases. Unlike [[mathematician]]s, philosophers cannot prove their claims beyond any doubt, so other philosophers are free to disagree and try to find counterexamples in response. Of course, now the first philosopher can argue that the alleged counterexample does not really apply.

Alternatively, the first philosopher can modify their claim so that the counterexample no longer applies; this is analogous to when a mathematician modifies a conjecture because of a counterexample.

For example, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', [[Callicles]], trying to define what it means to say that some people are "better" than others, claims that those who are stronger are better.

But [[Socrates]] replies that, because of their strength of numbers, the class of common rabble is stronger than the propertied class of nobles, even though the masses are [[prima facie]] of worse character. Thus Socrates has proposed a counterexample to Callicles' claim, by looking in an area that Callicles perhaps did not expect — groups of people rather than individual persons.

Callicles might challenge Socrates' counterexample, arguing perhaps that the common rabble really are better than the nobles, or that even in their large numbers, they still are not stronger. But if Callicles accepts the counterexample, then he must either withdraw his claim or modify it so that the counterexample no longer applies. For example, he might modify his claim to refer only to individual persons, requiring him to think of the common people as a collection of individuals rather than as a mob.

As it happens, he modifies his claim to say "wiser" instead of "stronger", arguing that no amount of numerical superiority can make people wiser.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28149">In philosophy, specifically in the area of modal [[metaphysics]], '''counterpart theory''' is an alternative to standard ([[Saul Kripke|Kripkean]]) possible-worlds semantics for interpreting quantified [[modal logic]]. Counterpart theory still presupposes [[possible world]]s, but differs in certain important respects from the Kripkean view. The form of the theory most commonly cited was developed by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], first in a paper and later in his book ''[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]''.

==Differences from the Kripkean view==
Counterpart theory (hereafter "CT"), as formulated by Lewis, requires that individuals exist in only one world. The standard account of possible worlds assumes that a modal statement about an individual (e.g., "it is possible that x is y") means that there is a possible world, W, where the individual x has the property y; in this case there is only one individual, x, at issue. On the contrary, counterpart theory supposes that this statement is really saying that there is a possible world, W, wherein exists an individual that is not x itself, but rather a distinct individual 'x' different from but nonetheless similar to x.  So, when I state that I might have been a banker (rather than a philosopher) according to counterpart theory I am saying not that I exist in another possible world where I am a banker, but rather my counterpart does. Nevertheless, this statement about my counterpart is still held to ground the truth of the statement that I might have been a banker.  The requirement that any individual exist in only one world is to avoid what Lewis termed the "problem of accidental intrinsics" which (he held) would require a single individual to both have and simultaneously not have particular properties.

In its formalization, counterpart theoretic formalization of modal discourse also departs from the standard formulation by eschewing use of modality operators (Necessarily, Possibly) in favor of quantifiers that range over worlds and 'counterparts' of individuals in those worlds.  Lewis put forth a set of primitive predicates and a number of axioms governing CT and a scheme for translating standard modal claims in the language of quantified modal logic into his CT.

In addition to interpreting modal claims about objects and possible worlds, CT can also be applied to the identity of a single object at different points in time. The view that an object can retain its identity over time is often called [[endurantism]], and it claims that objects are ‘wholly present’ at different moments (see [[#The counterpart relation|the counterpart relation]], below). An opposing view is that any object in time is made up of temporal parts or is [[Perdurantism|perduring]].

[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]' view on possible worlds is sometimes called [[modal realism]].

=== The basics ===

The possibilities that CT is supposed to describe are “ways a world might be” (Lewis 1986:86) or more exactly:

: (1) absolutely every way that a world could possibly be is a way that some world is, and

: (2) absolutely every way that a part of a world could possibly be is a way that some part of some world is. (Lewis 1986:86.)

Add also the following “principle of recombination,” which Lewis describes this way: “patching together parts of different possible worlds yields another possible world […].  [A]nything can coexist with anything else, […] provided they occupy distinct spatiotemporal positions.” (Lewis 1986:87-88). But these possibilities should be restricted by CT.

==The counterpart relation==

The counterpart relation (hereafter C-relation) differs from the notion of identity. Identity is a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], and [[transitive relation|transitive]] relation. The counterpart relation is only a [[similarity relation]]; it needn’t  be transitive or symmetric.  The C-relation is also known as [[genidentity]] (Carnap 1967), [[I-relation]] (Lewis 1983), and the [[unity relation]] (Perry 1975).

If identity is shared between objects in different possible worlds then the same object can be said to exist in different possible worlds (a ''trans-world'' object, that is, a series of objects sharing a single identity).

=== Parthood relation ===

An important part of the way Lewis’s worlds deliver possibilities is the use of the parthood relation.   This gives some neat formal machinery, [[mereology]]. This is an axiomatic system that uses formal logic to describe the relationship between parts and wholes, and between parts within a whole. Especially important, and most reasonable, according to Lewis, is the strongest form that accepts the existence of mereological sums or the thesis of [[unrestricted mereological composition]] (Lewis 1986:211-213).

== The formal theory ==

As a formal theory, counterpart theory can be used to translate sentences into modal quantificational logic. Sentences that seem to be quantifying over possible individuals&lt;!-- what does this mean? --&gt; should be translated into CT. (Explicit primitives and axioms have not yet been stated for the temporal or spatial use of CT.) Let CT be stated in quantificational logic and contain the following primitives:

: Wx (x is a possible world)
: Ixy (x is in possible world y)
: Ax (x is actual)
: Cxy (x is a counterpart of y)

We have the following axioms (taken from Lewis 1968):

: A1.  Ixy → Wy
: (Nothing is in anything except a world)

: A2. Ixy ∧ Ixz → y=z
: (Nothing is in two worlds)

: A3. Cxy → ∃zIxz
: (Whatever is a counterpart is in a world)

: A4. Cxy → ∃zIyz
: (Whatever has a counterpart is in a world)

: A5. Ixy ∧ Izy ∧ Cxz → x=z
: (Nothing is a counterpart of anything else in its world)

: A6. Ixy → Cxx
: (Anything in a world is a counterpart of itself)

: A7. ∃x (Wx ∧ ∀y (Iyx ↔ Ay))
: (Some world contains all and only actual things)

: A8. ∃xAx
: (Something is actual)

It is an uncontroversial assumption to assume that the primitives and the axioms A1 through A8 make the standard counterpart system.

=== Comments on the axioms ===

*A1 excludes individuals that exist in no world at all. The way an individual is in a world is by being a part of that world, so the basic relation is mereological.
*A2 excludes individuals that exist in more than one possible world. But because David Lewis accepts the existence of arbitrary mereological sums there are individuals that exist in several possible worlds, but they are not possible individuals because none of them have the property of being actual. And that is because it is not possible for such a whole to be actual.
*A3 and A4 make counterparts worldbound, excluding an individual that has a non-worldbound counterpart.
*A5 and A6 restrict the use of the CT-relation so that it is used within a possible world when and only when it is stood in by an entity to itself.
*A7 and A8 make one possible world the unique actual world.

=== Principles that are not accepted in normal CT ===

: R1 Cxy → Cyx
: (Symmetry of the counterpart relation)

: R2 Cxy ∧ Cyz → Cxz
: (Transitivity of the counterpart relation)

: R3 Cy&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x ∧ Cy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;x ∧ Iy&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Iy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;≠y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;≠w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: (Nothing in any world has more than one counterpart in any other world)

: R4 Cyx&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Cyx&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ix&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ix&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w2 ∧ x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;≠x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;≠w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: (No two things in any world have a common counterpart in any other world)

: R5 Ww&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ww&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ixw&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ∃y (Iyw&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Cxy)
: (For any two worlds, anything in one is a counterpart of something in the other)

: R6 Ww&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ww&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ixw&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ∃y (Iyw&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Cyx)
: (For any two worlds, anything in one has some counterpart in the other)

== Motivations for counterpart theory ==
CT can be applied to the relationship between identical objects in different worlds or at different times. Depending on the subject, there are different reasons for accepting CT as a description of the relation between different entities.

=== In possible worlds ===

David Lewis defended [[Modal realism]]. This is the view that a possible world is a concrete, maximal connected spatio-temporal region. The actual world is one of the possible worlds; it is also concrete. Because a single concrete object demands spatio-temporal connectedness, a possible concrete object can only exist in one possible world. Still, we say true things like: It is possible that [[Hubert Humphrey]] won the 1968 US presidential election. How is it true? Humphrey has a counterpart in another possible world that wins the 1968 election in that world.

Lewis also argues against three other alternatives that might be compatible with possibilism: overlapping individuals, trans-world individuals, and [[haecceity]].

Some philosophers, such as [[Peter van Inwagen]] (1985), see no problem with [[Identity (social science)|identity]] within a world &lt;!-- This quote doesn't imply Lewis' support for transworld identity  --&gt;. Lewis seems to share this attitude. He says:

:"… like the Holy Roman Empire, it is badly named. […]  In the first place we should bear in mind that Trans-World Airlines is an intercontinental, but not as yet an interplanetary carrier. More important,&lt;!-- The first part of this quote makes no sense without context --&gt; we should not suppose that we have here any problem with ''identity''.

:We never have. Identity is utterly simple and unproblematic. Everything is identical to itself; nothing is ever identical to anything else except itself. There is never any problem about what makes something identical to itself; nothing can ever fail to be. And there is never any problem about what makes two things identical; two things never can be identical.

:There might be a problem about how to define identity to someone sufficiently lacking in conceptual resources — we note that it won't suffice to teach him certain rules of inference — but since such unfortunates are rare, even among philosophers, we needn't worry much if their condition is incurable.

:We ''do'' state plenty of genuine problems in terms of identity. But we ''needn't'' state them so.” (Lewis 1986:192-193)

====Overlapping individuals====

An overlapping individual has a part in the actual world and a part in another world. Because identity is not problematic, we get overlapping individuals by having overlapping worlds. Two worlds overlap if they share a common part. But some properties of overlapping objects are, for Lewis, troublesome (Lewis 1986:199-210).

The problem is with an object’s accidental intrinsic properties, such as shape and weight, which supervene on its parts. Humphrey could have the property of having six fingers on his left hand. How does he do that?  It can’t be true that Humphrey has both the property of having six fingers and five fingers on his left hand. What we might say is that he has five fingers ''at this'' world and six fingers ''at that'' world. But how should these [[modifiers]] be understood?

According to McDaniel (2004), if Lewis is right, the defender of overlapping individuals has to accept genuine contradictions or defend the view that every object has all its properties essentially.

How can you be one year older than you are? One way is to say that there is a possible world where you exist.   Another way is for you to have a counterpart in that possible world, who has the property of being one year older than you.

==== Trans-world individuals ====

Take Humphrey: if he is a trans-world individual he is the [[mereological sum]] of all of the possible Humphreys in the different worlds. He is like a road that goes through different regions. There are parts that overlap, but we can also say that there is a northern part that is connected to the southern part and that the road is the mereological sum of these parts. The same thing with Humphrey. One part of him is in one world, another part in another world.

:"It is possible for something to exist iff it is possible for the whole to exist. That is, iff there is a world at which the whole of it exists.  That is, iff there is a world such that quantifying only over parts of that world, the whole of it exists. That is, iff the whole of it is among the parts of some world. That is, iff it is part of some world – and hence not a trans-world individual. Parts of worlds are ''possible'' individuals; trans-world individuals are therefore ''impossible'' individuals."

==== Haecceity ====

A [[haecceity]] or [[individual essence]] is a property that only a single object instantiates. Ordinary properties, if one accepts the existence of [[universals]], can be exemplified by more than one object at a time. Another way to explain a haecceity is to distinguish between ''suchness'' and ''thisness'', where thisness has a more demonstrative character.

David Lewis gives the following definition of a haecceitistic difference: “two worlds differ in what they represent ''de re'' concerning some individual, but do not differ qualitatively in any way.” (Lewis 1986:221.)

CT does not require distinct worlds for distinct possibilities – “a single world may provide many possibilities, since many possible individuals inhabit it” (Lewis 1986:230). CT can satisfy multiple counterparts in one possible world.

===Temporal parts===
{{main|Temporal parts}}
[[Perdurantism]] is the view that material objects are not wholly present at any single instant of time; instead, some [[temporal parts]] is said to be present. Sometimes, especially in the [[theory of relativity]] as it is expressed by [[Minkowski]], the path traced by an object through spacetime. According to [[Ted Sider]], “Temporal parts theory is the claim that time is like space in one particular respect, namely, with respect to parts.”&lt;ref&gt;Sider, et al. (2008) ''Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics'', [http://tedsider.org/papers/temporal_parts.pdf "Temporal Parts"].&lt;/ref&gt; Sider associates endurantism with a C-relation between temporal parts.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} (''See also:'' [[Temporal Parts#The argument from temporary intrinsics|The argument from temporary intrinsics]]).

Sider defends a revised way of counting. Instead of counting individual objects, timeline slices or the temporal parts of an object are used. Sider discusses an example of counting road segments instead of roads simpliciter. (Sider 2001:188-192). (Compare with Lewis 1993.) Sider argues that, even if we knew that some material object would go through some [[Nuclear fission|fission]] and split into two, "we would not ''say''" that there are two objects located at the same [[spacetime]] region. (Sider 2001:189)

How can one predicate temporal properties of these momentary temporal parts? It is here that the C-relation comes in play. Sider proposed the sentence: "Ted was once a boy." The truth condition of this sentence is that "there exists some person stage x prior to the time of utterance, such that x is a boy, and x bears the temporal counterpart relation to Ted." (Sider 2001:193)

== Counterpart theory and the necessity of identity ==

Kripke's three lectures on proper names and identity, (1980), raised the issues of how we should interpret statements about identity. Take the statement that the Evening Star is identical to the Morning Star.  Both are the [[planet]] [[Venus]].  This seems to be an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' identity statement. We discover that the names designate the same thing. The traditional view, since [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], has been that statements or propositions that are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] are [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]. But in the end of the sixties Saul Kripke and Ruth Barcan Marcus offered proof for the necessary truth of identity statements. Here is the Kripke's version (Kripke 1971):

: (1) ∀x &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;(x = x)                [Necessity of self-identity]
: (2) ∀x∀y [x = y → ∀P(Px → Py)]                 [Leibniz law]
: (3) ∀x∀y [x = y → (&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;(x = x) →  &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;(x = y))]    [From (1) and (2)]
: (4) ∀x∀y [x = y → &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;(x = y)]    [From the following principle A → B → C ⇒ A → C and (3)]

If the proof is correct the distinction between the a priori/a posteriori and necessary/contingent becomes less clear. The same applies if identity statements are necessarily true anyway.  (For some interesting comments on the proof, see Lowe 2002.) The statement that for instance “Water is identical to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O” is (then) a statement that is necessarily true but a posteriori. If CT is the correct account of modal properties we still can keep the intuition that identity statements are contingent and a priori because counterpart theory understands the modal operator in a different way than standard [[modal logic]].

The relationship between CT and essentialism is of interest. (Essentialism, the necessity of identity, and rigid designators form an important troika of mutual interdependence.) According to David Lewis, claims about an object's essential properties can be true or false depending on context (in Chapter 4.5 in 1986 he calls against constancy, because an absolute conception of essences is constant over the logical space of possibilities). He writes:

: But if I ask how things would be if Saul Kripke had come from no sperm and egg but had been brought by a [[stork#Childbirth|stork]], that makes equally good sense. I create a context that makes my question make sense, and to do so it has to be a context that makes origins not be essential. (Lewis 1986:252.)

== Counterpart theory and rigid designators ==

Kripke interpreted proper names as [[rigid designators]] where a rigid designator picks out the same object in every possible world (Kripke 1980). For someone who accepts contingent identity statements the following semantic problem occurs (semantic because we deal with de dicto necessity) (Rea 1997:xxxvii).

Take a scenario that is mentioned in the paradox of coincidence.  A statue (call it “Statue”) is made by melding two pieces of clay together.  Those two pieces are called “Clay”. Statue and Clay seem to be identical, they exist at the same time, and we could incinerate them at the same time. The following seems true:

:(7) Necessarily, if Statue exists then Statue is identical to Statue.

But,

:(8) Necessarily, if Statue exists then Statue is identical to Clay

is false, because it seems possible that Statue could have been made out of two different pieces of clay, and thus its identity to Clay is not necessary.

Counterpart theory, qua-identity, and individual concepts can offer solutions to this problem.

=== Arguments for inconstancy ===

Ted Sider gives roughly the following argument (Sider 2001:223).  There is inconstancy if a proposition about the essence of an object is true in one context and false in another. C-relation is a similarity relation. What is similar in one dimension is not similar in another dimension. Therefore, the C-relation can have the same difference and express inconstant judgements about essences.

David Lewis offers another argument. [[The paradox of coincidence]] can be solved if we accept inconstancy. We can then say that it is possible for a dishpan and a piece of plastic to coincide, in some context. That context can then be described using CT.

Sider makes the point that David Lewis feels he was forced to defend CT, due to [[modal realism]]. Sider uses CT as a solution to [[the paradox of material coincidence]].

=== Counterpart theory compared to qua-theory and individual concepts ===

We assume that contingent identity is real.  Then it is informative to compare CT with other theories about how to handle ''[[de re]]'' representations.

''Qua-theory''

Kit Fine (1982) and Alan Gibbard (1975) (according to Rea 1997) are defences of qua-theory. According to qua-theory we can talk about some of an object's modal properties. The theory is handy if we don't think it is possible for Socrates to be identical with a piece of bread or a stone. Socrates qua person is essentially a person.

''Individual concepts''

According to [[Rudolf Carnap]], in modal contexts variables refer to individual concepts instead of individuals. An individual concept is then defined as a function of individuals in different possible worlds. Basically, individual concepts deliver semantic objects or abstract functions instead of real concrete entities as in CT.

=== Counterpart theory and epistemic possibility ===

Kripke accepts the necessity of identity but agrees with the feeling that it still seems that it is possible that Phospherus (the Morning Star)  is not identical to Hespherus (the Evening Star). For all we know, it could be that they are different. He says:

: What, then, does the intuition that the table might have turned out to have been made of ice or of anything else, that it might even have turned out not to be made of molecules, amount to? I think that it means simply that there might have been a table looking and feeling just like this one and placed in this very position in the room, which was in fact made of ice, In other words, I (or some conscious being) could have been qualitatively in the same epistemic situation that in fact obtains, I could have the same sensory evidence that I in fact have, about a table which was made of ice. The situation is thus akin to the one which inspired the counterpart theorists; when I speak of the possibility of the table turning out to be made of various things, I am speaking loosely. This table itself could not have had an origin different form the one it in fact had, but in a situation qualitatively identical to this one with respect to all evidence I had in advance, the room could have contained a table made of ice in place of this one. Something like counterpart theory is thus applicable to the situation, but it applies only because we are not interested in what might not be true of a table given certain evidence. It is precisely because it is not true that this table might have been made of ice from the Thames that we must turn here to qualitative descriptions and counterparts. To apply these notions to genuine de re modalities, is from the present standpoint, perverse. (Kripke 1980:142.)

So to explain how the illusion of necessity is possible, according to Kripke, CT is an alternative. Therefore, CT forms an important part of our theory about the [[knowledge of modal intuitions]]. (For doubt about this strategy, see Della Roca, 2002. And for more about the knowledge of modal statements, see Gendler and Hawthorne, 2002.)

== Arguments against counterpart theory&lt;!--'Humphrey objection' redirects here--&gt; ==

The most famous is Kripke's '''Humphrey objection'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. Because a counterpart is never identical to something in another possible world Kripke raised the following objection against CT:

: "Thus if we say "Humphrey might have won the election (if only he had done such-and-such), we are not talking about something that might have happened to ''Humphrey'' but to someone else, a "counterpart"." Probably, however, Humphrey could not care less whether someone ''else'', no matter how much resembling him, would have been victorious in another possible world. Thus, Lewis's view seems to me even more bizarre than the usual notions of transworld identification that it replaces. (Kripke 1980:45 note 13.)

One way to spell out the meaning of Kripke's claim is by the following imaginary dialogue: (Based on Sider MS)

:Against: Kripke means that Humphrey himself doesn’t have the property of possibly winning the election, because it is only the counterpart that wins.

:For: The property of possibly winning the election is the property of the counterpart.

:Against: But they can't be the same property because Humphrey has different attitudes to them: he cares about he himself having the property of possibly winning the election.  He doesn’t care about the counterpart having the property of possibly winning the election.

:For: But properties don't work the same way as objects, our attitudes towards them can be different, because we have different descriptions – they are still the same properties. That lesson is taught by the [[paradox of analysis]].

CT is inadequate if it can't translate all modal sentences or intuitions. Fred Feldman mentioned two sentences (Feldman 1971):
: (1) I could have been quite unlike what I in fact am.
: (2) I could have been more like what you in fact are than like what I in fact am. At the same time, you could have been more like what I in fact am than what you in fact are.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7640">In [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], a '''direct proof''' is a way of showing the
[[truth]] or falsehood of a given statement by a straightforward combination of
established facts, usually [[axiom]]s, existing [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]s and [[theorem]]s, without making any further assumptions.&lt;ref name="nutsandbolts"&gt;Cupillari, Antonella. ''The Nuts and Bolts of Proofs''. Academic Press, 2001. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to directly prove a [[Material conditional|conditional]] statement of the form "If ''p'', then ''q''", it suffices to consider the situations in which the statement ''p'' is true. Logical deduction is employed to reason from assumptions to conclusion. The type of logic employed is almost invariably [[first-order logic]], employing the quantifiers ''for all'' and ''there exists''. Common proof rules used are [[modus ponens]] and [[universal instantiation]].&lt;ref name="advanced-discrete-structure"&gt;C. Gupta, S. Singh, S. Kumar ''Advanced Discrete Structure''. I.K. International Publishing House Pvt. Ltd., 2010. Page 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, an [[indirect proof]] may begin with certain hypothetical scenarios and then proceed to eliminate the uncertainties in each of these scenarios until an inescapable conclusion is forced. For example, instead of showing directly ''p'' ⇒ ''q'', one proves its [[contrapositive]] ~''q'' ⇒ ~''p'' (one assumes ~''q'' and shows that it leads to ~''p''). Since ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' and ~''q'' ⇒ ~''p'' are equivalent by the principle of [[transposition (logic)|transposition]] (see [[law of excluded middle]]), ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' is indirectly proved. Proof methods that are not direct include [[proof by contradiction]], including [[proof by infinite descent]].  Direct proof methods include [[proof by exhaustion]] and [[proof by induction]].

==History and etymology==
[[File:Geometric Constructions.png|thumb|Geometric Constructions]]
[[File:Math Derivation.png|thumb|New result from an old result]]
A direct proof is the simplest form of proof there is. The word ‘proof’ comes from the Latin word probare,&lt;ref name="latin"&gt;New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; which means “to test”.  The earliest use of proofs was prominent in legal proceedings. A person with authority, such as a nobleman, was said to have probity, which means that the evidence was by his relative authority, which outweighed empirical testimony.  In days gone by, mathematics and proof was often intertwined with practical questions – with populations like the [[Egyptians]] and the [[Greeks]] showing an interest in surveying land.&lt;ref name="stevengkrantz"&gt;Krantz, Steven G. ''The History and Concept of Mathematical Proof''. February 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a natural curiosity with regards to [[geometry]] and [[trigonometry]] – particularly [[triangles]] and [[rectangles]]. These were the shapes which provided the most questions in terms of practical things, so early geometrical concepts were focused on these shapes, for example, the likes of buildings and pyramids used these shapes in abundance. Another shape which is crucial in the history of direct proof is the [[circle]], which was crucial for the design of arenas and water tanks. This meant that ancient geometry (and [[Euclidean Geometry]]) discussed circles.

The earliest form of mathematics was [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]]. For example, if someone could draw a reasonable picture, or give a convincing description, then that met all the criteria for something to be described as a mathematical “fact”. On occasion, [[analogical]] arguments took place, or even by “invoking the gods”. The idea that mathematical statements could be proven had not been developed yet, so these were the earliest forms of the concept of proof, despite not being actual proof at all.

Proof as we know it came about with one specific question: “what is a proof?” Traditionally, a proof is a platform which convinces someone beyond reasonable doubt that a statement is mathematically true. Naturally, one would assume that the best way to prove the truth of something like this (B) would be to draw up a [[comparison (mathematics)|comparison]] with something old (A) that has already been proven as true. Thus was created the concept of deriving a new result from an old result.

==Examples==

===The sum of two even integers equals an even integer===

Consider two [[Even and odd numbers|even]] integers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}. Since they are even, they can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; x =2a &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y=2b &lt;/math&gt;

respectively for integers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}. 
Then the sum can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; x+y = 2a + 2b = 2(a+b)=2p&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p=a+b&lt;/math&gt;, {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are all integers.
It follows that {{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''}} has 2 as a factor and therefore is even, so the sum of any two even integers is even.

===Pythagoras' theorem===

[[File:Diagram of Pythagoras Theorem simplified.png|right|Diagram of Pythagoras Theorem]]

Observe that we have four right-angled triangles and a square packed into a large square. Each of the triangles has sides ''a'' and ''b'' and hypotenuse ''c''. The area of a square is defined as the square of the length of its sides - in this case, ''(a + b)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. However, the area of the large square can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of its components. In this case, that would be the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the small square in the middle.&lt;ref name="theproofisthepudding"&gt;Krantz, Steven G. ''The Proof is the Pudding''. Springer, 2010. Page 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

We know that the area of the large square is equal to ''(a + b)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''.

The area of a triangle is equal to &lt;math&gt; \frac12ab. &lt;/math&gt;

We know that the area of the large square is also equal to the sum of the areas of the triangles, plus the area of the small square, and thus the area of the large square equals &lt;math&gt; 4(\frac 12 ab) + c^2.&lt;/math&gt;

These are equal, and so

::&lt;math&gt; (a + b)^2 = 4(\frac 12 ab) + c^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

After some simplifying,

::&lt;math&gt; a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

Removing the ab that appears on both sides gives

::&lt;math&gt; a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

which proves Pythagoras' theorem. ∎

=== The square of an odd number is also odd ===

By definition, if ''n'' is an odd integer, it can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; n = 2k + 1&lt;/math&gt;
for some integer ''k''. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
n^2 &amp;= (2k + 1)^2\\ 
&amp;= (2k + 1)(2k + 1)\\ 
&amp;=4k^2 + 2k + 2k + 1\\ 
&amp;=4k^2 + 4k + 1\\ 
&amp;=2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Since 2''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+ 2''k'' is an integer, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also odd.  ∎

[[File:Hankiss Elemér closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Hankiss in 2012]]
'''[[Elemér]] Hankiss''' (4 May 1928 – 10 January 2015) was a Hungarian [[sociologist]]. His first wife was MEP [[Ágnes Hankiss]].

He was born in the town of [[Debrecen]] in eastern Hungary, where his father, János Hankiss was a professor of literature.

He received his university degree in French and English languages from [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in [[Budapest]], where he later obtained a PhD.

Following the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] he spent 10 months in pretrial detention but was eventually acquitted.

He was the president of the Hungarian Television from 1990 to 1993. It was a state-owned monopoly at the time, which he tried to turn into a modern, production- and viewer-oriented, competition-ready media company. In 1993, he was controversially forced to resign in connection with the so-called 'Media War' (in Hungarian: médiaháború) between the government and the media in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-03|title=Hungary's 'Media War' Curbs Press Freedoms|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1993/0111/11051.html|newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=11 January 1993|issn=0882-7729|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written extensively on values system in Hungary and [[Central Europe]], as well as on global civilization. His concept of ''Second Society'' has been much cited in East European Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Stranius, Pentti: Lähde 2/2005, Joensuu. The Source for Second Society: Hankiss, Elemér (1988): The "Second Society": Is There an Alternative Social Model Emerging in Contemporary Hungary. In Social Research 55/1988, Nos 1-2, pp. 13-42.
&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been a professor at Stanford University, the [[Bruges]] and [[Florence]] University Institutes as well as the [[Central European University]].

He died in Budapest after a short illness on 10 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://hvg.hu/itthon/20150110_Elhunyt_Hankiss_Elemer/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hippolyte Gevaert''' or '''Fierens-Gevaert''' (1870, [[Brussels]] - 1926, [[Liège]]) was a Belgian art historian, philosopher, art critic, singer and writer.
[[File:Gustave van de Woestyne - Portrait de Hippolyte Fierens-Gevaert (1870-1926) - lithographie - Royal Library of Belgium - S.III 76733.jpg|thumb|Gustave van de Woestyne - Portrait of Hippolyte Fierens-Gevaert (1870-1926) - lithograph - Royal Library of Belgium - S.III 76733]]

==Life==
He had studied at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels|Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles]] in 1890 and won first prize for singing. That same year he married Jacqueline Marthe Gevaert, daughter of the musician [[François-Auguste Gevaert]] (1828-1908). He then joined the [[Opéra de Lille]], but an accident with his voice ended his singing career. He moved to Paris, where he began working as a journalist, writer and art critic and changed his surname to Fierens-Gevaert.

He later became the first curator of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] and was also a professor of aesthetics and art history.

The '''Hongzhou school''' ({{zh|c=洪州宗|p=Hóngzhōu Zōng}}) was a [[Chinese Chán|Chinese school of Chán]] of the [[Tang period]], which started with [[Mazu Daoyi]] (709–788). It became the archetypal expression of [[Zen]] during the [[Song Dynasty]].

==History==
[[File:RinzaiGigen.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Rinzai]]

The [[An Lu-shan Rebellion]] (755-763) led to a loss of control by the Tang dynasty, which changed the position of Chan. Metropolitan Chan began to lose its status, while...
{{quote|...other schools were arising in outlying areas controlled by warlords. These are the forerunners of the Chan we know today. Their origins are obscure; the power of Shen-hui's preaching is shown by the fact that they all trace themselves to Hui-neng.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003-A|p=11}}}}

===Mazu Daoyi===
Traditionally, Mazu Daoyi (709–788) is depicted as a successor in the lineage of [[Hui-neng]], since his teacher [[Nanyue Huairang]] is regarded as a student and successor of Huineng. This connection between Hui-neng and Nanyue Huairang is doubtful, being the product of later rewritings of Chán-history to place Mazu in the traditional lineages.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=82}}

Mazu settled at Kung-kung Mountain by Nankang, southern Kiangsi province,{{sfn|Chang|1971|p=148-149, 177 }} where he founded a monastery and gathered scores of disciples.{{sfn|Chang|1971|p=152}}

===Baizhang Huaihai===
Baizhang Huaihai (Pai-chang)(720–814) was the dharma heir of Mazu. He is usually said to have established an early set of rules for Chan monastics, the ''Pure Rules of Baizhang'' ({{zh|c=百丈清規 |p=Bǎizhàng qīngguī |w=Pai-chang ch'ing-kuei}}).,{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=170}} but there is no historical evidence that this text ever existed.{{sfn|Poceski|2010|p=19}} Some version of the old Buddhist Vinaya code, modified to some extent for the Chinese situation, was practiced in Dazhi Shousheng Chan-si (Ta-chih shou-sheng ch'an-ssu; Jp. Daichijusho-zenji), founded by Baizhang.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} This monastery contained a monks hall for meditation and sleeping, an innovation which became typical for Chán:
{{quote|During periods of ascetic practice the monks would sleep on the same straw mat on which they sat in meditation and on which, according to defined ritual, they took their meals. Both the lifestyle Pai-chang spelled out as well as the architectural form of his monastery became models for later Zen monasteries".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=171}}}}

===Huangbo Xiyun===
Very little is known of Huangbo Xiyun (died 850), who was a dharma heir of Baizhang Huaihai. He started his monastic career at Mount Huang-po. In 842 he took up residence at Lung-hsing Monastery ath the invitation of P'ei-hsiu (787 or 797–860). P'ei-hsiu was a lay-student of [[Guifeng Zongmi]],{{sfn|Wright|Year unknown}} fifth-generation heir of the Ho-tse line of the Southern school of [[Shenhui]], and a great scholar. Zongmi was...
{{quote|...critical of the Hung-chou style. For him, this excessively rural school of Buddhism lacked the comprehensive vision that he found in Ho-tse Zen and in the Hua-yen philosophical school of Buddhism.{{sfn|Wright|Year unknown}}}}
Péi-hsiu, however, became interested, and in 842 invited huangbo to the Lung-hsing Monastery.{{sfn|Wright|Year unknown}}

===Linji Yìxuán===
{{main|Linji Yixuan}}
Linji Yìxuán ((died 866 CE)) became the archetypal representant of Chán, as expressed in his recorded sayings. He was a student of Huangbo, who also figures in the ''Recorded sayings of Linj''. According to these records, Linji attained [[kensho]] while discussing Huángbò's teaching with the reclusive monk Dàyú (大愚). Linji then returned to Huángbò to continue his training. In 851 CE, Linji moved to the Linji temple in [[Hebei]], where he took his name, which also became the name for the lineage of his form of Chán Buddhism.

==Teachings==
The Hongzhou school developed "shock techniques such as shouting, beating, and using irrational retorts to startle their students into realization".{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Chang|1967}} Some of these are common today, while others are found mostly in anecdotes. It is common in many Chán traditions today for Chán teachers to have a stick with them during formal ceremonies which is a symbol of authority and which can be also used to strike on the table during a talk.

A well-known story depicts Mazu practicing dhyana, but being chided by his teacher [[Nanyue Huairang]], comparing seated meditation with polishing a tile.{{sfn|Faure|1997|p=73}} According to Faure, the criticism is not about dhyana as such, but 
{{quote|... the idea of "becoming a Buddha" by means of any practice, lowered to the standing of a "means" to achieve an "end".{{sfn|Faure|1997|p=73}}}}

The criticism of seated dhyana reflects a change in the role and position of monks in Tang society, who "undertook only pious works, reciting sacred texts and remaining seated in ''dhyana''".{{sfn|Faure|1997|p=74}} Nevertheless, seated dhyana remained an important part of the Chán tradition, also due to the influence of Guifeng Zongmi, who tried to balance dhyana and insight.{{sfn|Faure|1997|p=74}}

==Texts==
From the "question-and-answer format that had been developed as a means of conveying Buddhist teachings" developed the "yü-lü" genre,{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=192}} the recorded sayings of the masters, and the encounter dialogues. The best-known example is the "[[Linji Yixuan#External links|Lin-ji yü-lü]]".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://info.stiltij.nl/publiek/meditatie/leraren/_historisch/linji-sasaki.pdf Translation of the Lin-ji yü-lü by Fuller-Sasaki]&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the ''Ssu-chia yü lu'' (Jp. Shike Goruku, ''The Collection of the Four Houses''), which contains the recorded sayings of [[Mazu Daoyi]], [[Baizhang Huaihai]], [[Huangbo Xiyun]] and [[Linji Yixuan]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=179}}

These recorded sayings are not verbatim recordings of the sayings of the masters, but well-edited texts, written down up to 160 years after the supposed sayings and meetings.{{sfn|Welter|Year unknown}}

==Influence==
Mazu is perhaps the most influential teaching master in the formation of Chán Buddhism in China.{{sfn|Schuhmacher and Woerner (editors)|1991|p=141}} When Chán became the dominant school of Buddhism during the [[Song Dynasty]], in retrospect the later [[Tang Dynasty]] and Mazu's Hongzhou school became regarded as the "golden age" of Chan.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=18-21}}

The shock techniques became part of the traditional and still popular image of Chan masters displaying irrational and strange behaviour to aid their students.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Heine|2008}} Part of this image was due to later misinterpretations and translation errors, such as the loud belly shout known as ''katsu''. In Chinese "katsu" means "to shout", which has traditionally been translated as "yelled 'katsu'" - which should mean "yelled a yell"&lt;ref group=web&gt;See [http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Philosophical/Liberating_Language.html James D. Sellmann &amp; Hans Julius Schneider (2003), ''Liberating Language in Linji and Wittgenstein''. Asian Philosophy, Vol. 13, Nos. 2/3, 2003. Notes 26 and 41]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stories about the Hongzhou school are part of the Traditional Zen Narrative which developed in China during the Tang Dynasty and the beginning of the Song Dynasty, from the 7th to 11th century. It became dominant during the Song Dynasty, when Chán was the dominant form of Buddhism in China, due to support from the Emperial Court.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

This period is seen as the "golden age" of Chan, a "romantic coloring"{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=19}} discarded by McRae:
{{quote|...what is being referred to is not some collection of activities and events that actually happened in the 8th through 10th centuries, but instead the retrospective re-creation of those activities and events, the imagined identities of the magical figures of the Tang, within the minds of Song dynasty Chan devotees{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=19}}[...] This retrospective quality pervades the Chan tradition. Time and again we find we are dealing, not with what happened at any given point, but with what people thought happened previously{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=14}}}}

==Criticism==
The Hung-chou school has been criticised for its radical [[subitism]].

[[Guifeng Zongmi]] (圭峰 宗密) (780–841), an influential teacher-scholar and patriarch of both the Chán and the [[Huayan school]] claimed that the Hung-chou tradition believed "everything as altogether true".{{sfn|Gregory|2002|p=236}}

According to Zongmi, the Hung-chou school teaching led to a radical nondualism that believed that all actions, good or bad, are expressing the essential [[Buddha-nature]], but therefore denies the need for spiritual cultivation and moral discipline. This would be a dangerously [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] view as it eliminated all moral distinctions and validated any actions as expressions of the essence of Buddha-nature.

While Zongmi acknowledged that the essence of Buddha-nature and its functioning in the day-to-day reality are but difference aspects of the same reality, he insisted that there is a difference. To avoid the dualism he saw in the Northern Line and the radical [[nondualism]] and antinomianism of the Hung-chou school, Zongmi’s paradigm preserved "an ethically critical duality within a larger ontological unity",{{sfn|Gregory|2002|p=239}} an [[ontology]] which he claimed was lacking in Hung-chou Chan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14350">'''Humanity''' is a [[virtue]] associated with basic [[ethics]]   of [[altruism]] derived from the [[human condition]].

Humanity differs from mere [[justice]] in that there is a level of altruism towards individuals included in humanity more so than the fairness found in justice.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, humanity, and the acts of love, altruism, and social intelligence are typically individual strengths while fairness is generally expanded to all. 
Peterson &amp; Seligman in ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification]]'' (2004) class humanity as  one of six virtues that are consistent across all cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept goes back to the development of "humane" or "[[Renaissance humanism|humanist]]" philosophy during the [[Renaissance]] (with predecessors in 13th-century [[scholasticism]] stressing a concept of basic [[human dignity]] inspired by [[Aristotelianism]]) and the concept of [[humanitarianism]] in the [[early modern period]], and resulted in modern notions such as "[[human rights]]".

== Historical perspectives ==

=== Confucian philosophy ===
[[Confucius]] said that humanity, or “[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]”(仁), is a “love of people” stating “if you want to make a stand, help others make a stand.”&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the Confucian theory of humanity exemplifies the golden rule. It is so central to Confucian thought that it appears 58 times in the [[Analects]].&lt;ref&gt;Chan 1955, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the Christian process of seeking God, Confucius teachers seeking Ren to a point of seemingly divine mastery until you are equal to, or better than, your teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 1955, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confucian concept of Ren encompasses both love and altruism.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 1955, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek philosophy ===
[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] both wrote extensively on the subject of virtues, though neither ever wrote on humanity as a virtue, despite highly valuing love and kindness, two of the strengths of humanity. Plato and Aristotle considered "courage, justice, temperance" and "generosity, wit, friendliness, truthfulness, magnificence, and greatness of soul" to be the sole virtues, respectively.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Abrahamic religion ===
Humanity is one of [[Thomas Aquinas]]' "Seven Heavenly Virtues."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that, humanity was so important in some positivist Christian cultures that it was to be capitalized like God.&lt;ref&gt;Coit 1906, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kindness, altruism and love are all mentioned in the bible. Proverbs 19:22 "states the desire of a man is his kindness." On the topic of altruism, emphasis is placed on helping strangers (Hebrews 13:1) and the biblical adage "it is better to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35).

== Strengths of humanity ==

=== Love ===
Love has many different definitions ranging from a set of purely biological and chemical processes to a religious concept. As a character strength, love is a mutual feeling between two people characterized by attachment, comfort, and generally positive feelings. It can be broken down into 3 categories:  love between a child and their parents, love for your friends, and romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Having love as a strength is not about the capacity to love, as such, it is about being involved in a loving relationship.

Love, in the psychological sense, is most often studied in terms of attachment to others. A degree of controversy surrounds defining and researching love in this way, as it takes away the “mystery of love.”&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Because love is mysterious, to an extent, it is most often studied in terms of attachment theory, because it can be studied in the way across ages. In infants, attachment is studied through the Strange Situation Test. Attachment to an individual, usually the mother, is determined by how distressed the infant becomes when the mother is taken out of the experimental setting.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several models of adult attachment including the Adult Attachment Interviews (Kaplan &amp; Main), Adult Attachment Prototypes (Hazan &amp; Shaver) and more. Generally adult attachment models focus on the [[mental representation]] of the visible signs of attachment seen in infants.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence in support of the benefits of love are seen in the negative affect states that result from lacking love. Orphaned children have been targeted in studies about negative attributes resulting from lack of attachment. Smyke ''et al.'' found that children raised in an environment that didn’t allow children to become attached to their preferred caregivers experienced [[Attachment_disorder|attachment disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Smkye 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, individuals who develop securely attached have a lower likelihood of depression, high-self esteem, and less likelihood of divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kindness ===
The strength kindness encompasses most related terms that evoke feelings of altruism, generosity, helpfulness and a general desire to help people. That is, a disposition for helping humanity. The following statements are from the [[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths | Values in Action]] (VIA) psychological assessment, aimed at determining people's strengths in kindness: others are just as important to me, giving is more important than receiving, I care for the ungrateful as well as the grateful.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Kindness, as a part of humanity, is deeply rooted in philosophical and religious traditions, each having words for the altruistic love aspect of kindness, such as ''agape'' in Greek, ''chesed'' in Hebrew, and the Latin word ''philantropia'', the root of the word "philanthropy."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Kindness is so valued as a strength beyond religious and theoretical concepts that it is advocated through school community service programs and national programs like AmeriCorps. Additionally, while gender differences in kindness are statistically significant, they are minimal, and the methods of testing used may not always have construct validity.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kindness is most often measured on a case by case measure and not usually as a trait. The Self-Report Altruism Scale and the Altruism Facet Scale for Agreeableness Measure of the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory]] (NEO-PI-R) psychological assessment are often used to ask people how often they engage in altruistic behaviors and gauge their concern for others.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; The former, however, only asks about 20 specific altruistic acts, leaving out a wide range of altruistic behaviors.

There are numerous benefits from kindness and altruism on both sides of the action. For some, the motivation to be kind comes from a place of egoistic motivation, and thus the benefit to them is the positive affect state they receive from the action.&lt;ref&gt;Dovido et. al 1990, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that the process of being kind develops pro-social skills in children, which positively effects their attachments and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Zeece 2009, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, volunteerism in the elderly has shown to lead to decreased risk of early death, and mental health benefits.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; One thing to note is the difference between altruism as a trait and as an act.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== Social Intelligence ===
Social intelligence is the most modern of the three strengths associated with humanity. The Character Strengths and Virtues (CSV) psychological assessment  defines social intelligence as the ability to understand “relationships with other people, including the social relationships involved in intimacy and trust, persuasion, group membership, and political power.”&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligence has many psychological definitions from Weschler’s intelligence to the various theories of multiple intelligence. The CSV divides intelligence into hot and cold, hot intelligence being those intelligences related to active emotional processes. (338) Individuals with high social intelligence are very self-aware, and effective organizers and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it combines elements of the other two hot intelligences, personal and emotional intelligence. Personal intelligence being the internal counterpart to social intelligence and emotional intelligence being the capacity to understand emotions. The CSV highlights three social intelligence measurement scales: Factor Based Social Intelligence Tasks, Psychological Mindedness Assessment Procedure, and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional intelligence Test.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Intelligence research is limited, however, there is much literature on the characteristics associated with social intelligence. Zaccaro ''et al.'' found social intelligence and perceptiveness to be integral to effective leadership; that is, good leaders are “social experts.”&lt;ref&gt;Zaccaro et. al 1991, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional intelligence, too, plays a role in leadership. Another study found that emotional intelligence enables leaders to better understand their followers, thereby enhancing their ability to influence them.&lt;ref&gt;George 2000, p. 1043.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological research on humanity as a virtue ==

=== Virtue and wellbeing ===

Although only a relatively new field of inquiry for psychological researchers, ''character strengths''&lt;ref&gt;Isaacowitz, D. M., Vallant, G. E. &amp; Seligman, M. E. P. (2003). Strengths and satisfaction across the adult lifespan. International Journal of Aging and Human Development, 57(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, N., Peterson, C. &amp; Seligman, M. E. P. (2004). Strengths of character and well-being.  Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 23, 603-619.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''virtues''&lt;ref&gt;Fowers, B. J. (2005). Virtue and psychology: Pursuing excellence in ordinary practices. American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toner, E., Haslam, N., Robinson, J., &amp; Williams, P. (2012). Character strengths and wellbeing in adolescence: Structure and correlates of the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Children. Personality and Individual Differences, 52(5), 637-642.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, R. M., &amp; Deci, E. L. (2001). On happiness and human potentials: A review of research on hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. Annual review of psychology, 52(1), 141-166.&lt;/ref&gt; have been consistently measured in psychometric surveys and have been shown to be positively associated with psychological and subjective wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Schuurmans-Stekhoven, J. B. (2011). "Is it God or just the data that moves in mysterious ways? How well-being research might be mistaking faith for virtue?". Social Indicators Research. 100 (2): 313–330. doi:10.1007/s11205-010-9630-7.&lt;/ref&gt; What is more, even among those who endorse a spiritual/theistic worldview, these salutary associations appear to be better explained by humanity/civility rather than endorsing a faith in a supernatural being.&lt;ref&gt;Schuurmans-Stekhoven, J. B. (2013). “As a Shepherd Divideth his Sheep from the Goats”: Does the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale Encapsulate Separable Theistic and Civility Components?. Social indicators research, 110(1), 131-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

She founded the first centre of feminist studies at a European university at the Centre universitaire de Vincennes of the [[University of Paris]] (today's [[University of Paris VIII]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/059529-000-A/vincennes-l-universite-perdue |title=VINCENNES, L'UNIVERSITÉ PERDUE |accessdate=2016-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608050554/http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/059529-000-A/vincennes-l-universite-perdue |archivedate=8 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She holds honorary degrees from [[Queen's University]] and the [[University of Alberta]] in Canada; [[University College Dublin]] in Ireland; the [[University of York]] and [[University College London]] in the UK; and [[Georgetown University]], [[Northwestern University]], and the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] in the USA.

==Life and career==
=== Academic Career ===
Cixous earned her [[agrégation]] in English in 1959&lt;ref name=PoetryFoundation&gt;{{cite web  | url = https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/helene-cixous | title = Hélène Cixous | publisher = Poetry Foundation | access-date = 2 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and her ''[[Doctorate|Doctorat ès lettres]]'' in 1968. Her main focus, at this time, was [[English literature]] and the works of [[James Joyce]]. Cixous became ''assistante'' at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1962, served as ''maître assistante'' at [[the Sorbonne]] from 1965-1967, and was appointed ''maître de conférence'' at [[Paris Nanterre University]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=Conley &gt;{{Citation  | last = Conley | first = Verena A. | editor-last = Sartori | editor-first = Eva M. | editor2-last = Zimmerman  | editor2-first = Dorothy W. | title = French Women Writers | place =  | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | series = Bison Book | date = 1 January 1994 | chapter = Hélène Cixous | pages = 66-77 | isbn = 978-0803292246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1968, following the [[May 1968 events in France|French student riots]], Cixous was charged with founding the [[University of Paris VIII]], "created to serve as an alternative to the traditional French academic environment."&lt;ref name=Crockett&gt;{{cite web  | url = https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/peaking-behind-the-curtains-of-adieux/#! | title = Peaking Behind the Curtains of Adieux | last = Crockett | first = Benjamin | date = 12 August 2015 | website = Los Angeles Review of Books | access-date = 2 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cixous would, in 1974, found the University's center for [[women's studies]], the first in Europe.&lt;ref name=PoetryFoundation /&gt; Cixous is a professor at the University of Paris VIII and at the [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://egs.edu/faculty/helene-cixous | title = Hélène Cixous | publisher = The European Graduate School  | access-date = 2 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Publications ===
In 1968, Cixous published her doctoral dissertation ''L'Exil de James Joyce ou l'Art du remplacement'' (''The Exile of James Joyce, or the Art of Displacement'') and the following year she published her first novel, ''Dedans'' (''Inside''), a semi-autobiographical work that won the [[Prix Médicis]].&lt;ref name=PoetryFoundation /&gt; 

She has published widely, including twenty-three volumes of poems, six books of essays, five plays, and numerous influential articles. She published ''Voiles'' (''Veils'') with [[Jacques Derrida]] and her work is often considered [[Deconstruction|deconstructive]]. In introducing her Wellek Lecture, subsequently published as ''Three Steps on the Ladder of Writing'', Derrida referred to her as the greatest living writer in his language (French).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Cixous | first = Hélène | title = Three Steps on the Ladder of Writing | publisher = Columbia University Press | date = 15 April 1994 | location = New York City | isbn = 978-0231076593 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cixous wrote a book on Derrida titled ''Portrait de Jacques Derrida en jeune saint juif'' (''Portrait of Jacques Derrida as a Young Jewish Saint''). Her reading of Derrida finds additional layers of meaning at a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] rather than strictly [[Lexicon|lexical]] level.&lt;ref&gt;Not the same as [[pun]]s, which play on the varied means of a word or phrase or the [[homonym]]s thereof.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Derrida and Joyce, she has written [[monograph]]s on the work of the Brazilian writer [[Clarice Lispector]], on [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Heinrich von Kleist]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Ingeborg Bachmann]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and the Russian poet [[Marina Tsvetaeva]].
 
Along with [[Luce Irigaray]] and [[Julia Kristeva]], Cixous is considered one of the mothers of [[Post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the 1970s, Cixous began writing about the relationship between [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and language. Like other poststructuralist feminist theorists, Cixous believes that our sexuality is directly tied to how we communicate in society. In 1975, Cixous published her most influential article "Le rire de la méduse" ("The Laugh of the Medusa"), which was revised by her, translated into English by Paula Cohen and Keith Cohen, and released in English in 1976.&lt;ref name=Cixous /&gt; She has published over 70 works; her fiction, dramatic writing and poetry, however, are not often read in English.&lt;!--Unencyclopedic?: The difficulty of translating her work may be minimally exemplified even by examining the title just discussed.--&gt;

===The Bibliothèque nationale de France===
In 2000, a collection in Cixous' name was created at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] after Cixous donated the entirety of her manuscripts to date. They then featured in the exhibit "Brouillons d'écrivains" held there in 2001.

In 2003, the Bibliothèque held the conference "Genèses Généalogies Genres: Autour de l'oeuvre d'Hélène Cixous." Among the speakers were Mireille Calle-Gruber, Marie Odile Germain, Jacques Derrida, Annie Leclerc, Ariane Mnouchkine, Ginette Michaud, and Hélène Cixous herself.

=== Personal life ===
Cixous was born in [[Oran]], [[French Algeria]] to Jewish parents, Eve Cixous, née Klein (b. 1910) and Georges Cixous (1909–1948).&lt;ref name=jwa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/cixous-helene |title=Hélène Cixous |publisher=Jewish Women's Archive |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georges Cixous, a physician who had written his dissertation on tuberculosis, died of the disease in 1948. Eve Cixous became a midwife following his death, "until her expulsion with the last French doctors and midwives in 1971."&lt;ref name=jwa /&gt; Cixous' brother, Pierre, "a medical student and a supporter of [[Algerian independence]]" was condemned to death in 1961 by the [[Organisation Armée Secrète]], and would join Cixous in Bordeaux. Her mother and brother would return to Algeria following the country's independence in 1962. They would be arrested, and Cixous "obtained their release with the help of [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]’s lawyer."&lt;ref name=jwa /&gt;

Cixous married Guy Berger in 1955, with whom she had three children, Anne-Emmanuelle (b. 1958), Stéphane (1960-1961), and Pierre-François (b. 1961). Cixous and Berger divorced in 1964.&lt;ref name=jwa /&gt;

==Influences on Cixous' writing==
Some of the most notable influences on her writings have been [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]]. &lt;!--Unencyclopedic: In order to truly understand all the layers that exist within Cixous writings, we must understand the fundamental principles that she is drawing on, or more importantly attempting to destroy.--&gt;

===Sigmund Freud===
[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalyst]] Sigmund Freud established the initial theories which would serve as a basis for some of Cixous' arguments in developmental psychology. Freud's analysis of gender roles and sexual identity concluded with separate paths for boys and girls through the Oedipus complex, theories of which Cixous was particularly critical.

===Jacques Derrida===
Contemporaries, lifelong friends, and intellectuals, [[Jacques Derrida]] and Cixous both grew up as French Jews in Algeria and share a "belonging constituted of exclusion and nonbelonging"—not Algerian, rejected by France, their Jewishness concealed or acculturated. In Derrida's family "one never said 'circumcision' but 'baptism,' not 'Bar Mitzvah' but 'communion.'" Judaism cloaked in Catholicism is one example of the undecidability of identity that influenced the thinker whom Cixous calls a "Jewish Saint."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-12824-7/portrait-of-jacques-derrida-as-a-young-jewish-saint%5D |title=Portrait of Jacques Derrida as a Young Jewish Saint - Description of Cixous's ''Portrait of Jacques Derrida as a Young Jewish Saint'' |work=Columbia University Press|accessdate= 4 September 2014|isbn=9780231128247 |date=February 2004 |last1=Cixous |first1=Hélène }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book ''Portrait of Jacques Derrida as a Young Jewish Saint'' addresses these matters.

Through [[deconstruction]], Derrida employed the term ''[[logocentrism]]'' (which was not his coinage). This is the concept that explains how language relies on a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] system that values the spoken word over the written word in [[Western culture]]. The idea of [[binary opposition]] is essential to Cixous' position on language. &lt;!--Explain: The binary oppositions must have a term with more value in culture than the other.--&gt;

Cixous and [[Luce Irigaray]] combined Derrida's logocentric idea and Lacan's symbol for desire, creating the term ''[[phallogocentrism]]''. This term focuses on Derrida's social structure of speech and binary opposition as the center of reference for language, with the phallic being privileged and how women are only defined by what they lack; not A vs. B, but, rather A vs. ¬A ([[Negation|not]]-A).

In a dialogue between Derrida and Cixous, Derrida said about Cixous: "Helene's texts are translated across the world, but they remain untranslatable. We are two French writers who cultivate a strange relationship, or a strangely familiar relationship with the French language -- at once more translated and more untranslatable than many a French author. We are more rooted in the French language than those with ancestral roots in this culture and this land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = From the Word to Life: A Dialogue between Jacques Derrida and Hélène Cixous | journal = New Literary History: Hélène Cixous: When the Word is a Stag | date = Winter 2006 | first = Jacques | last = Derrida |author2=Hélène Cixous |author3=Aliette Armel |author4=Ashley Thompson | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | jstor = 20057924 }}&lt;!--| accessdate = 8 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==
===''The Laugh of the Medusa'' (1975)===
Cixous' critical feminist essay "The Laugh of the Medusa," originally written in French as ''Le Rire de la Méduse'' in 1975, was (after she revised it) translated into English by Paula Cohen and Keith Cohen in 1976.&lt;ref name=Cixous /&gt; In the essay, Cixous issues an ultimatum: that women can either read and choose to stay trapped in their own bodies by a language that does not allow them to express themselves, or they can use the body as a way to communicate. She describes a writing style, ''Écriture feminine'', that she says attempts to move outside of the conversational rules found in patriarchal systems. She argues that ''Écriture feminine'' allows women to address their needs by building strong self-narratives and identity. This text is situated in a history of feminist conversations that separated women in terms of their gender and women in terms of authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarrat|title=Performing Feminisms, Histories, Rhetoric|date=Winter 1992|issue=22|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Laugh of the Medusa" addresses this rhetoric, writing on individuality and commanding women to use writing and the body as sources of power and inspiration. Cixous uses the term the "Logic of Antilove" to describe her understanding of the systematic oppression of women by patriarchal figures. She defines the Logic of Antilove as the self-hatred women have, "they have made for women an antinarcissism! A narcissism which loves itself only to be loved by what women haven’t got," this idea persecutes women by defining them by what misogynistic tradition believes makes the female sex inferior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cixous|title=The Rhetorical Tradition|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martins|pages=1524–1536}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cixous commands women to focus on individuality, particularly the individuality of the body and to write to redefine self-identity in the context of her history and narrative. The essay includes the argument that writing is a tool women must use to advocate for themselves in order to acquire the freedom women have historically been denied.

"The Laugh of the Medusa" is an exhortation and call for a "feminine mode" of writing which Cixous calls "white ink" and "écriture féminine." Cixous builds the text using the elements of this mode and fills it with literary allusions. She instructs  women to use writing as a means of authority. Cixous explores how the female body is closely connected to female authorship. She conveys this message by employing a conversational dialogue in which she instructs her audience directly. She urges her audience to write using many direct conversational statements such as "Writing is for you, you are for you; your body is yours, take it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cixous|title=The Rhetorical Tradition|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martin's|pages=1524–1536}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cixous' repetition in her message that women must write for themselves and claim their bodies bridges the gap between the physicality of the female body and their authorship. In doing so she challenges the distinctions between theory and practice expanding on the feminist rhetorical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|title=Hélène Cixous: Writing the Feminine|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Laugh of the Medusa" is successful in its creation of a writing style that allows women to claim authority because it was created on the foundation of the woman’s claim to herself and her body, therefore eliminating the oppressive effects of patriarchal control of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="écriture feminine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buchanan|title=A Dictionary of Critical Theory|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text is also a critique of logocentrism and phallogocentrism, because it de-prioritizes the masculine form of reason traditionally associated with rhetoric, having much in common with Jacques Derrida's earlier thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enos|title=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition|publisher=Garland Pub|pages=262–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay also calls for an acknowledgment of universal bisexuality or polymorphous perversity, a precursor of queer theory's later emphases, and swiftly rejects many kinds of essentialism which were still common in Anglo-American feminism at the time.

In homage to French theorists of the feminine, ''Laughing with Medusa'' was published by Oxford University Press in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3360">'''Ian Charles Jarvie''' (born 8 July 1937) is a philosopher trained in [[England]], long resident in [[Canada]]. Jarvie studied at the [[London School of Economics]] under [[Karl Popper]]. He is a member of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and managing editor of the journal ''Philosophy of the Social Sciences''.

The [[philosophy of social science]] and the [[movie industry]] are two of his main topics of research. He is a professor at [[York University]] in [[Toronto]].

Jarvie's philosophical temperament is influenced by his former teacher, Karl Popper. Other influences include: [[David Hume]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Ernest Gellner]].
Further, Jarvie's philosophical method owes a debt to training in social anthropology.  In this vein, he has published anthropological work on the cargo cults of the South Pacific and has contributed anthropological studies on the media.  His adherence to [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] in the study of the social differs from that of [[Durkheim]] and his followers in his holding that knowledge and ideas must be presented as causal variables.  Further, Jarvie contends, it must be the case that a functionalist framework with an active role for explanatory ideas requires a conception of rationality towards ideas.  Politically, Jarvie is a liberal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10649">An '''infinitary logic''' is a [[Formal logical system|logic]] that allows infinitely long [[statement (logic)|statements]] and/or infinitely long [[Mathematical proof|proofs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=Structures and Norms in Science| last=Moore| first=Gregory| title=The Prehistory of Infinitary Logic: 1885–1955| pages=105–123| publisher=Springer, Dordrecht| year=1997| url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-0538-7_7| doi=10.1007/978-94-017-0538-7_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some infinitary logics may have different properties from those of standard [[first-order logic]]. In particular, infinitary logics may fail to be [[Compactness (logic)|compact]] or [[Completeness (logic)|complete]]. Notions of compactness and completeness that are equivalent in [[finitary logic]] sometimes are not so in infinitary logics. Therefore for infinitary logics, notions of strong compactness and strong completeness are defined. This article addresses Hilbert-type infinitary logics, as these have been extensively studied and constitute the most straightforward extensions of finitary logic. These are not, however, the only infinitary logics that have been formulated or studied.

Considering whether a certain infinitary logic named [[Ω-logic]] is complete promises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Woodin| first=W. Hugh| title=The Continuum Hypothesis, the generic-multiverse of sets, and the Ω Conjecture| publisher=Harvard University Logic Colloquium| year=2009| url=http://logic.harvard.edu/EFI_Woodin_TheContinuumHypothesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; to throw light on the [[continuum hypothesis]].

==A word on notation and the axiom of choice==
As a language with infinitely long formulae is being presented, it is not possible to write such formulae down explicitly. To get around this problem a number of notational conveniences, which, strictly speaking, are not part of the formal language, are used. &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt; is used to point out an expression that is infinitely long. Where it is unclear, the length of the sequence is noted afterwards. Where this notation becomes ambiguous or confusing, suffixes such as &lt;math&gt;\lor_{\gamma &lt; \delta}{A_{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt; are used to indicate an infinite [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] over a set of formulae of [[cardinality]] &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. The same notation may be applied to quantifiers for example &lt;math&gt;\forall_{\gamma &lt; \delta}{V_{\gamma}:}&lt;/math&gt;. This is meant to represent an infinite sequence of quantifiers for each &lt;math&gt;V_{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;.

All usage of suffixes and &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt; are not part of formal infinitary languages.

The axiom of choice is assumed (as is often done when discussing infinitary logic) as this is necessary to have sensible distributivity laws.

==Definition of Hilbert-type infinitary logics==

A first-order infinitary logic ''L''&lt;sub&gt;α,β&lt;/sub&gt;, α [[regular cardinal|regular]], β = 0 or ω ≤ β ≤ α, has the same set of symbols as a finitary logic and may use all the rules for formation of formulae of a finitary logic together with some additional ones:
*Given a set of formulae &lt;math&gt;A=\{A_\gamma | \gamma &lt; \delta &lt;\alpha \}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(A_0 \lor A_1 \lor \cdots)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A_0 \land A_1 \land \cdots)&lt;/math&gt; are formulae. (In each case the sequence has length &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.)
*Given a set of variables &lt;math&gt;V=\{V_\gamma | \gamma&lt; \delta &lt; \beta \}&lt;/math&gt; and a formula &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\forall V_0 :\forall V_1 \cdots (A_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists V_0 :\exists V_1 \cdots (A_0)&lt;/math&gt; are formulae. (In each case the sequence of quantifiers has length &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.)

The concepts of free and bound variables apply in the same manner to infinite formulae. Just as in finitary logic, a formula all of whose variables are bound is referred to as a ''[[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]''.

A [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] T in infinitary logic &lt;math&gt;L_{\alpha , \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of sentences in the logic. A proof in infinitary logic from a theory T is a sequence of statements of length &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; which obeys the following conditions: Each statement is either a logical axiom, an element of T, or is deduced from previous statements using a rule of inference. As before, all rules of inference in finitary logic can be used, together with an additional one:

*Given a set of statements &lt;math&gt;A=\{A_\gamma | \gamma &lt; \delta &lt;\alpha \}&lt;/math&gt; which have occurred previously in the proof then the statement &lt;math&gt;\land_{\gamma &lt; \delta}{A_{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt; can be inferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics| volume=36| pages=39–54| last=Karp| first=Carol| title=Chapter 5 Infinitary Propositional Logic| year=1964| url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049237X08704233| doi=10.1016/S0049-237X(08)70423-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logical axiom schemata specific to infinitary logic are presented below. Global schemata variables: &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \delta &lt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;((\land_{\epsilon &lt; \delta}{(A_{\delta} \implies A_{\epsilon})}) \implies (A_{\delta} \implies \land_{\epsilon &lt; \delta}{A_{\epsilon}}))&lt;/math&gt;
*For each &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;((\land_{\epsilon &lt; \delta}{A_{\epsilon}}) \implies A_{\gamma})&lt;/math&gt;
*Chang's distributivity laws (for each &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;): &lt;math&gt;(\lor_{\mu &lt; \gamma}{(\land_{\delta &lt; \gamma}{A_{\mu , \delta}})})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\forall \mu \forall \delta \exists \epsilon &lt; \gamma: A_{\mu , \delta} = A_{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A_{\mu , \delta} = \neg A_{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\forall g \in \gamma^{\gamma} \exists \epsilon &lt; \gamma: \{A_{\epsilon} , \neg A_{\epsilon}\} \subseteq \{A_{\mu , g(\mu)} : \mu &lt; \gamma\}&lt;/math&gt;
*For &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;((\land_{\mu &lt; \gamma}{(\lor_{\delta &lt; \gamma}{A_{\mu , \delta}})}) \implies (\lor_{\epsilon &lt; \gamma^{\gamma}}{(\land_{\mu &lt; \gamma}{A_{\mu ,\gamma_{\epsilon}(\mu)})}}))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\{\gamma_{\epsilon}: \epsilon &lt; \gamma^{\gamma}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a well ordering of &lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;
The last two axiom schemata require the axiom of choice because certain sets must be [[well order]]able. The last axiom schema is strictly speaking unnecessary as Chang's distributivity laws imply it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society| volume=61| pages=325–326| last=Chang| first=Chen-Chung| title=Algebra and Theory of Numbers| year=1955| url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1955-61-04/S0002-9904-1955-09932-4/S0002-9904-1955-09932-4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it is included as a natural way to allow natural weakenings to the logic.

==Completeness, compactness, and strong completeness==
A theory is any set of statements. The truth of statements in models are defined by recursion and will agree with the definition for finitary logic where both are defined. Given a theory T a statement is said to be valid for the theory T if it is true in all models of T.

A logic &lt;math&gt;L_{\alpha , \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is complete if for every sentence S valid in every model there exists a proof of S. It is strongly complete if for any theory T for every sentence S valid in T there is a proof of S from T. An infinitary logic can be complete without being strongly complete.

A cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa \neq \omega&lt;/math&gt; is [[weakly compact cardinal|weakly compact]] when for every theory T in &lt;math&gt;L_{\kappa , \kappa}&lt;/math&gt; containing at most &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; many formulas, if every S &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; T of cardinality less than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; has a model, then T has a model. A cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa \neq \omega&lt;/math&gt; is [[strongly compact cardinal|strongly compact]] when for every theory T in &lt;math&gt;L_{\kappa , \kappa}&lt;/math&gt;, without restriction on size, if every S &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; T of cardinality less than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; has a model, then T has a model.

==Concepts expressible in infinitary logic==
In the language of set theory the following statement expresses [[Axiom of regularity|foundation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall_{\gamma &lt; \omega}{V_{\gamma}:} \neg \land_{\gamma &lt; \omega}{V_{\gamma +} \in V_{\gamma}}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the axiom of foundation, this statement admits no non-standard interpretations. The concept of well foundedness can only be expressed in a logic which allows infinitely many quantifiers in an individual statement. As a consequence many theories, including [[Peano arithmetic]], which cannot be properly axiomatised in finitary logic, can be in a suitable infinitary logic. Other examples include the theories of [[non-archimedean field]]s and [[torsion-free group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Rosinger| first=Elemer| title=Four Departures in Mathematics and Physics| year=2010| url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.760.6726&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=1&amp;zoom=auto,-7,-196}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three theories can be defined without the use of infinite quantification; only infinite junctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic| volume=XXI| number=1| pages=111–118| last=Bennett| first=David| title=Junctions| year=1980| url=https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ndjfl/1093882943| doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1093882943}}&lt;/ref&gt; are needed.

==Complete infinitary logics==
Two infinitary logics stand out in their completeness. These are &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega , \omega}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1 , \omega}&lt;/math&gt;. The former is standard finitary first-order logic and the latter is an infinitary logic that only allows statements of countable size.

&lt;math&gt;L_{\omega , \omega}&lt;/math&gt; is also strongly complete, compact and strongly compact.

&lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1, \omega}&lt;/math&gt; fails to be compact, but it is complete (under the axioms given above). Moreover, it satisfies a variant of the [[Craig interpolation]] property.

If &lt;math&gt;L_{\alpha, \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is strongly complete (under the axioms given above) then &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is strongly compact (because proofs in these logics cannot use &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; or more of the given axioms).

[[File:Biester.jpg|thumb|Johann Erich Biester by [[Ferdinand Collmann]], 1795, [[Gleimhaus]] Halberstadt]]
'''Johann Erich Biester''' (17 November 1749, [[Lübeck]] – 20 February 1816, [[Berlin]]) was a German philosopher. With [[Friedrich Nicolai]] and [[Friedrich Gedike]], he formed what was known as the 'Triumvirate' of late Enlightenment Berlin.

==Life==
From 1767 to 1771 he studied law and English literature in [[Göttingen]] and was taken on as a jurist in Lübeck.

&lt;!---
== Leben ==
1767 bis 1771 studierte Erich Biester die Rechte und die englische Literatur in [[Göttingen]] und war danach als Jurist in Lübeck tätig. Ab 1783 war der [[Aufklärer]] Mitherausgeber der [[Berlinische Monatsschrift|Berlinischen Monatsschrift]] (mit dem Pädagogen Gedike, der 1791 von der Redaktion zurücktrat) sowie Herausgeber der [[Berlinische Blätter|Berlinischen Blätter]] und der Neuen Berlinischen Monatsschrift bis 1811. Biester trat im Sinne der [[Aufklärung]] gegen den sich ausbreitenden [[Okkultismus]] sowie gegen irrationale Gefühlsduselei (Schwärmerei) ein. Des verstärkt um sich greifenden Einflusses des katholischen und jesuitischem [[Proselyt]]entum widersetzte er sich vehement.

[[File:Johann Erich Biester.gif|mini|Johann Erich Biester]]
Er war [[Freimaurerei|Freimaurer]] und Mitglied der [[Berliner Mittwochsgesellschaft]] (Deckname: Axiomachus, d.h. der Kämpferische) sowie der [[Gesetzlose Gesellschaft zu Berlin|Gesetzlosen Gesellschaft zu Berlin]] und war ein Studienfreund von [[Gottfried August Bürger]] an der [[Georg-August-Universität Göttingen|Universität Göttingen]]. 1773 erhielt er eine Lehrerstelle am Pädagogium der Universität in [[Bützow]] (Mecklenburg), die er nach kurzer Zeit aufgab und promovierte 1773 an der [[Universität Bützow]] zum Dr. jur.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe dazu den Eintrag der [http://purl.uni-rostock.de/matrikel/400080817 Promotion von Johann Erich Biester] im [[Rostocker Matrikelportal]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ab 1777 war er Staatssekretär des Preußischen Kultusministers [[Karl Abraham Freiherr von Zedlitz]]. Seit 1784 war er dann als Bibliothekar der [[Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin|Königlichen Bibliothek]] Berlin tätig (Amtsübergabe erfolgte durch König [[Friedrich II. (Preußen)|Friedrich II.]] von Preußen persönlich) und später Leiter derselben. Er war Beamter und bis zu seinem Tode 'Großredner' der [[Große Landesloge der Freimaurer von Deutschland|Großen Landesloge der Freimaurer von Deutschland]] in Berlin (''[[Schwedisches Lehrsystem|Zinnendorfisches]] System''). (Seit [[1777]] Mitglied, [[1789]]–[[1816]] Meister vom Stuhl der dortigen Loge 'Zum goldenen Pflug'.)&lt;ref&gt;H. Schüttler, „Die Mitglieder des Illuminatenordens“&lt;/ref&gt; Er war ein Freund des Philosophen [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), den er 1791 in Königsberg aufsuchte.

== Johann Erich Biester im philosophischen Diskurs seiner Zeit ==
Kants Artikel ''[[Was ist Aufklärung?]]'' erschien 1784 in der Berlinischen Monatsschrift und eröffnete die Aufklärungsdebatte, nachdem Biesters Aufsatz „Vorschlag, die Geistlichen nicht mehr bei Vollziehung der Ehen zu bemühen“ für Furore gesorgt hat. Biester verteidigte Kant später in Berlin durch eine direkte Eingabe (Immediatgesuch) bei König [[Friedrich Wilhelm II. (Preußen)|Friedrich Wilhelm II.]], um das Recht zu erwirken - und gegen die zwischenzeitlich verschärfte [[Zensur (Informationskontrolle)|Zensur]] zu opponieren, denn es wurde ihm verboten, Kants Aufsätze drucken zu dürfen. Das Gesuch wurde jedoch durch Zedlitz' Nachfolger [[Johann Christoph von Wöllner]] (1732-1800) abschlägig beschieden. Dieser war bestrebt, die „Apostel des Unglaubens“ Gedike und Biester auf die [[Zitadelle Spandau]] zu verbannen. - Biester war ein Freund der Brüder [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Wilhelm]] und [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Mit letzterem arbeitete er in der [[Königlich-Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften|Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften]], Berlin, deren Mitglied der philologischen Klasse er aufgrund der Preußischen Zensur erst 1798 wurde, gegen Ende seines Lebens eng zusammen.

Im Disput zwischen dem Aufklärer [[Thomas Paine]] (1737-1809) und dem Konservativen [[Edmund Burke]] (1729-1797) - in Deutschland vertreten durch [[Friedrich von Gentz]] (1764-1832) - stellte sich Biester auf die Seite Paines. Als Bibliothekar galt sein Interesse besonders den jungen Philologen wie [[Friedrich August Wolf]] (1759-1824) und [[Philipp Buttmann (Pädagoge)|Philipp Buttmann]] (1764-1829), sowie den Literaten [[Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué]] (1777-1843), [[Karl August Varnhagen von Ense]] (1785-1858) und [[Karl Friedrich Klöden]] (1786-1856).

Sein Streit mit [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762-1814) fand viel Beachtung. Biester lehnte Fichtes Philosophie rigoros ab - in diesem Punkt dachte er ähnlich wie die späteren [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788-1860) und [[Heinrich Heine]] (1797-1856), der schrieb: „Der Fichtesche Idealismus gehört zu den kolossalsten Irrtümern, die je ein menschlicher Geist ausgeheckt“. Die Ablehnung Biesters richtete sich nicht nur gegen Fichtes unverhohlenen [[Antisemitismus (bis 1945)|Antisemitismus]] - Biester sympathisierte mit der protestantischen Richtung der [[Sozinianer]] und dem [[Deismus]] der [[Unitarismus (Religion)|Unitarier]] -, sondern vornehmlich gegen Fichtes Streitsucht und arrogante Rechthaberei. Gegen die Berufung Fichtes zum Mitglied der Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften in die philosophische Klasse sprachen sich Nicolai und Biester gemeinsam aus und verhinderten damit Fichtes Aufnahme.

'''John Ralston Saul''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|OOnt}} (born June 19, 1947) is a Canadian writer, [[political philosopher]], and public intellectual. Saul is most widely known for his writings on the nature of [[individualism]], [[citizenship]] and the [[public good]]; the failures of manager-led societies;&lt;ref&gt;Or, more precisely, [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]-led.&lt;/ref&gt; the confusion between [[leadership]] and [[managerialism]]; [[military strategy]], in particular [[irregular warfare]]; the role of [[freedom of speech]] and culture; and critiques of the modern economic situation. He is a champion of freedom of expression and was the International President of [[PEN International]], an association of writers. Saul is the co-founder and co-chair of the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, a national charity promoting the inclusion of new citizens.

His work is known for being thought-provoking and ahead of its time, leading him to be called a "prophet" by  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.speakers.ca/speakers/john-ralston-saul/|title = John Ralston Saul |website = Speakers' Spotlight |access-date=August 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to be included in ''[[Utne Reader]]'''s list of the world's leading thinkers and visionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://writerstrust.com/Awards/Shaughnessy-Cohen-Prize-for-Political-Writing/2014-Finalists/John-Ralston-Saul.aspx |title=2014 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing Finalist |website=The Writers' Trust of Canada |access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works have been translated into 25 languages in 36 countries.&lt;ref name="uwin"/&gt;

== Biography ==
Saul is the son of William Saul, an army officer, and a British mother whose family had a long tradition of military service.&lt;ref name="walrus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thewalrus.ca/citizen-saul/ |website= The Walrus |date=April 12, 2010 |title=Citizen Saul |author=Henighan, Stephen |access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His life, from the beginning, took place in a national context. Born in Ottawa, and christened in Calgary, he spent his infancy in Alberta and much of his childhood in Manitoba, but graduated from high school in Oakville, Ontario. At a young age he became fluent in both national languages, French and English. By the time he started university at [[McGill University]], Montreal, his father was in Paris and Brussels, working as a military adviser to the Canadian ambassador to NATO.

After completing his undergraduate Saul was accepted into the foreign service, but the death of his father in 1968 changed Saul's career plans. He left the foreign service to attend [[King's College London]], where he wrote his thesis on the modernization of France under [[Charles de Gaulle]], and earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1972. His doctoral thesis, "The Evolution of Civil-Military Relations in France after the Algerian War", led him to France for research. There he began to write his first novel, ''Mort d'un général'', a romanticized version of his thesis on de Gaulle's Chief of staff. He supported himself by running the French subsidiary of a British investment company.

After helping to set up the national oil company [[Petro-Canada]] in 1976, as assistant to its first chair, [[Maurice F. Strong]], Saul published his first novel, ''The Birds of Prey'', in 1977. Strong described Saul as "an invaluable, though unconventional, member of my personal staff."&lt;ref name="walrus"/&gt;

Through the late 1970s into the 1980s, Saul travelled extensively and regularly spent time with guerrilla armies, spending a great deal of time in North Africa and South East Asia. Out of this time came his novels, ''The Field Trilogy''. It was during those extended periods in Northwest Africa and Southeast Asia where he witnessed fellow writers there suffering government suppression of freedom of expression, which caused him to become interested in the work of [[PEN International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/books/story/2009/10/23/saul-pen.html|title=Ralston Saul to focus on indigenous languages at PEN|date=October 23, 2009|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the years of 1990 and 1992, Saul acted as the President of the Canadian centre of PEN International and in 2009 he was elected president of PEN and re-elected for a second and last term in 2012, remaining International President until October 2015.

== Writing ==
=== Fiction ===
''The Birds of Prey'' (1977) is a political novel based in [[Gaullist]] France. Between 1983 and 1988 Saul then published ''The Field Trilogy'', which deals with the crisis of modern power and its clash with the individual. It includes ''[[Baraka (novel)|Baraka, or The Lives, Fortunes and Sacred Honor of Anthony Smith]]'' (1983), ''The Next Best Thing'' (1986), and ''The Paradise Eater'' (1988), which won the ''Premio Letterario Internazionale'' in Italy.

''De si bons Américains'' (1994) is a [[picaresque novel]] in which he observes the lives of America's ''nouveaux riches''. A vastly reworked and expanded version was published in 2012 as ''Dark Diversions'', Saul's first novel in over fifteen years.

=== Non-fiction ===

==== ''Voltaire's Bastards'', ''The Doubter's Companion'' and ''The Unconscious Civilization'' ====
Saul's non-fiction began with the trilogy comprising the bestseller ''Voltaire's Bastards: The Dictatorship of Reason in the West''(1992), the polemic philosophical dictionary ''The Doubter's Companion: A Dictionary of Aggressive Common Sense'' (1994), and the book that grew out of his 1995 [[Massey Lectures]], ''The Unconscious Civilization'' (1995). The last won the [[1996 Governor General's Award]] for Non-Fiction Literature.

These books deal with themes such as the dictatorship of [[reason]] unbalanced by other human qualities, how it can be used for any ends especially in a directionless state that rewards the pursuit of power for power's sake. He argues that this leads to deformations of thought such as [[ideology]] promoted as [[truth]]; the rational but anti-democratic structures of [[corporatism]], by which he means the worship of small groups; and the use of language and [[expert]]ise to mask a practical understanding of the harm caused by this, and what else our society might do. He argues that the rise of individualism with no regard for the role of society has not created greater individual autonomy and self-determination, as was once hoped, but isolation and alienation. He calls for a pursuit of a more [[humanism|humanist]] ideal in which reason is balanced with other human mental capacities such as [[common sense]], [[ethics]], [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], creativity, and memory, for the sake of the common good, and he discusses the importance of unfettered language and practical democracy. These attributes are elaborated upon in his 2001 book ''On Equilibrium''.

==== ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' ====
He expanded on these themes as they relate to Canada and [[History of Canada|its history]] and [[Culture of Canada|culture]] in ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' (1998). In this book, he proposed the idea of Canada being a "soft" country, meaning not that the nation is weak, but that it has a flexible and complex identity, as opposed to the unyielding or monolithic identities of other states.

He argues that Canada's complex national identity is made up of the "triangular reality" of the three nations that compose it: [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|First Peoples]], [[francophone]]s, and [[English language|anglophones]]. He emphasizes the willingness of these Canadian nations to compromise with one another, as opposed to resorting to open confrontations. In the same vein, he criticizes both those in the  [[Quebec separatism|Quebec separatist]] Montreal School for emphasizing the conflicts in Canadian history and the [[Orange Order in Canada|Orange Order]] and the [[Clear Grits]] traditionally seeking clear definitions of Canadian-ness and loyalty.

==== ''On Equilibrium'' ====
Saul's next book, ''On Equilibrium'' (2001), is effectively a fourth, concluding volume to his philosophical quartet. He identifies six qualities as common to all people: common sense, ethics, imagination, intuition, memory, and reason. He describes how these inner forces can be used to balance each other, and what happens when they are unbalanced, for example in the case of a "Dictatorship of Reason".

==== ''The Collapse of Globalism'' ====
In an article written for ''[[Harper's]]'' magazine's March 2004 issue, titled ''The Collapse of Globalism and the Rebirth of Nationalism'', he argued that the [[Globalization|globalist]] ideology was under attack by counter-movements. Saul rethought and developed this argument in ''The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World'' (2005). Far from being an inevitable force, Saul argued that globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their national interests in both positive and destructive ways. Following the economic collapse he had predicted, ''The Collapse of Globalism'' was re-issued in 2009 with a new epilogue that addressed the current crisis.

==== ''A Fair Country'' ====
''A Fair Country'' (2008) is Saul's second major work on Canada. It is organized into four subsections.
;"A Métis Civilization": This section picks up on the argument that Saul makes in ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' about the 'triangular reality of Canada'. Drawing on the work of scholars like [[Harold Innis]] and Gerald Friesen,&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, Gerald. ''Citizens and Nation: An Essay on History, Communication, and Canada''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Saul argues that contemporary Canada has been deeply influenced and shaped by Aboriginal ideas and the experience of both Francophone and Anglophone immigrants over the 250 years, from 1600 on, during which Aboriginals were either the dominant force in Canada, or equal partners. He argues that Aboriginals are making a rapid "comeback", and that their fundamental influence needs to be recognized in order for non-Aboriginal Canadians to understand themselves.

;"Peace, Fairness, and Good Government": In this section Saul argues that instead of the phrase "[[peace, order, and good government]]", which appears in and has become a touchstone of the 1867 [[Canadian Constitution]], the phrase that dominated previous Canadian documents was "peace, ''welfare'', and good government". Saul suggests that the ensuing emphasis on "order" has not truly represented Canadian origins.

;"The Castrati": This sections echoes Saul's more general critiques of [[technocracy|technocratic]] and [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] regimes. He also suggests that while current Canadian elites reflect a "disturbing mediocrity" this was not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;Saul, John Ralston. ''A Fair Country: Telling Truths About Canada''. Toronto: Viking, 2008, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

;"An Intentional Civilization": Saul uses the final section of the book to argue for a return to an understanding of Canada as a unique response to particular historical circumstances.

==== ''Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine and Robert Baldwin'' ====
Saul's contribution to [[Penguin Books|Penguin Canada's]] ''Extraordinary Canadians'' series, of which he serves as general editor, is a double biography of [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine]] and [[Robert Baldwin]]. In it, he argues that Canada did not begin in [[Canadian Confederation|1867]], but that in fact its foundations were laid by LaFontaine and Baldwin much earlier. The two leaders of [[Lower Canada|Lower]] and [[Upper Canada]], respectively, worked together after the [[Act of Union 1840|1841 Union]] to lead a reformist movement for [[responsible government]] run by elected citizens instead of a colonial governor. But it was during the "Great Ministry" of 1848—51 that the two politicians implemented laws that Saul argues created a more equitable country. They revamped judicial institutions, created a public education system, made bilingualism official, designed a network of public roads, began a public postal system, and reformed municipal governance. Faced with opposition, and even violence, Saul contends that the two men united behind a set of principles and programs that formed modern Canada.

==== ''The Comeback'' ====
His most recent work, ''The Comeback: How Aboriginals Are Reclaiming Power and Influence'' (2014) was a shortlisted nominee for the 2015 [[Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/shaughnessy-cohen-prize-finalists-announced/article22648737/ |title=Shaughnessy Cohen Prize finalists announced |author=Medley, Mark |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date= January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "comeback" that Saul identifies in this new book emphasizes the strides that Aboriginal people have made in reversing years of population decline and "cultural oppression". As recently as seventy years ago it was widely assumed that Indians were disappearing, the victims of disease, starvation and their own ineptitude for modern civilization. Canada's Aboriginal population is growing in numbers and its cultural and political self-confidence seems boundless. In Saul's view, this observation, while obvious to anyone who studies the history, nonetheless needs hammering home. We are far more used to hearing about the dismal lives of Aboriginal people—their family dysfunction, their crime rates, their impoverished communities—than we are to being told they are a success story. Today's Aboriginal population, for all the problems that afflict it, has overcome incredible disadvantages to achieve what Saul calls "a position of power, influence and civilizational creativity" in Canadian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geist.com/fact/columns/time-for-a-rewrite/|title=Time for a Rewrite|author=Francis, Daniel |website=Geist |date=November 19, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

Saul is co-chair of the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, which encourages new Canadians to become active citizens. He is patron and former president of the Canadian Centre of [[PEN International]]. He is also founder and honorary chair of French for the Future, which encourages bilingual French-English education, chair of the advisory board for the [[LaFontaine-Baldwin Symposium]] lecture series, and a patron of Planned Lifetime Advocacy Network. From 1999 until 2006, his wife [[Adrienne Clarkson]] was [[Governor General of Canada]], making him Canada's [[viceregal consort of Canada|viceregal consort]]. During this period he devoted much of his time to issues of freedom of expression, poverty, public education and bilingualism.

=== PEN International ===
Saul was elected as the international president of [[PEN International]] for a three-year term at its Annual Congress in Linz, Austria in October 2009.  He was the first Canadian to be elected to that position, which had previously been held by [[John Galsworthy]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Heinrich Böll]], [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] and Homero Aridjis.&lt;ref name="walrus"/&gt; He campaigned on the need to pay attention to smaller and endangered languages and cultures, arguing that the ultimate removal of freedom of expression was the loss of a language. He put a specific emphasis on endangered indigenous languages. He called for a further decentralization of PEN, which has 144 centres in 102 countries. He argues that literature and freedom of expression are the same thing; that you cannot have one without the other. Saul has testified before the European Parliament Human Rights Commission on the loss of freedom of expression in Tunisia, has spoken before European Council on Refugees in Exile, and has published an essay on writers in exile, which has been translated into several languages.

=== The Institute for Canadian Citizenship ===
Saul founded, and currently co-chairs, the Institute for Canadian Citizenship (ICC) with [[Adrienne Clarkson]]. The ICC is a national, non-profit charity that helps accelerate new citizens’ integration into Canadian life through original programs, collaborations and unique volunteer opportunities. While its focus is on encouraging new citizens to take their rightful place in Canada, the ICC aims to encourage all citizens – new or not – to embrace active citizenship in their daily life.

=== Speaking ===
In addition to his selection as the 1995 Massey lecturer, Saul has delivered other notable lectures. He gave the Harold Innis Lecture in 1994. In 2000 he gave the inaugural [[LaFontaine-Baldwin Symposium]]
Lecture. Saul delivered the J.D. Young Memorial Lecture "A New Era of Irregular Warfare?" at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]] on February 4, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090226001034/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&amp;DocID=4295 |title=His Excellency John Ralston Saul J.D. Young Memorial Lecture 'A New Era of Irregular Warfare?' |publisher=Governor General of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave the 2005 IDEAS lecture in Brisbane, Australia, the 2007 Captive Mind Lecture in Kraków, Poland, and in 2008 gave the 33rd Sir Winston Scott Memorial Lecture in Barbados. He also delivered the 2009 [[McGill Law Journal#McGill Law Journal.27s Annual Lecture|McGill Law Journal's Annual Lecture]] at the McGill Faculty of Law in Montreal on February 3, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/news.php The McGill Law Journal Annual Lecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226002941/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/news.php |date=December 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul also spoke at the [[Sydney Opera House]] on August 26, 2012 on the subject "It's Broke: How do we fix it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saul|first=John Ralston|title=Slaves to Money and Growth: when did saving a bank become more important than saving a country?|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/slaves-to-money-and-growth-20120817-24dxs.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julián Besteiro Fernández''' (21 September 1870 – 27 September 1940) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Socialism|socialist]] politician, elected to the [[Cortes Generales]] and in 1931 as Speaker of the [[Constituent Cortes]] of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. He also was elected several times to the town council of Madrid. During the same period, he was a university professor of philosophy and logic, and dean of the department at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]].

==Early life==
[[Image:Julián Besteiro.JPG|thumb|left|Julián Besteiro in 1915]]
Born in [[Madrid]], he was educated in the [[Institución Libre de Enseñanza]], and studied in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]], as well as at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1896, the Universities of [[University of Munich|Munich]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] in 1909-1910. In 1908, he joined the [[Radical Party (Spain)|Partido Radical]] (Radical Party) established by [[Alejandro Lerroux]].

He became a member of the ''Agrupación Socialista Madrileña'' (the socialist circle in Madrid) in 1912. That year he was offered the Chair of Fundamental Logic in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the University of Madrid. Soon after, Besteiro became a member of [[Unión General de Trabajadores]] (UGT) [[trade union]], and of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE).&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;Jackson, Gabriel. ''The Spanish Republic and The Civil War, 1931-1939.'' Princeton University Press. Princeton. 1967. p. 470&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 he married Dolores Cebrián, a professor of physics and natural science at the teachers' training college in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].

In 1917, after the [[general strike]], Besteiro was among many members of the strike committee tried in Madrid; he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Following his release under the [[amnesty campaign]], he was elected as a member of the town council of Madrid.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt;

==Entry into electoral politics==
The following year, Besteiro was elected to the Cortes (the Spanish Parliament) as member of the Congress of Deputies for Madrid.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt;

During the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]], Besteiro favored collaboration by the socialists with the leader. Primo de Rivera offered UGT participation in governing the country. To a certain extent, the arrangement in the mid-1920s appeared to be a success. Opinion within the PSOE turned against Besteiro as the Primo de Rivera regime became more unpopular during the economic downturn as part of the [[Great Depression]].

By the mid-1930s, Besteiro became politically isolated in his opinions on collaboration. This was opposed by the republican front established by the [[Pact of San Sebastián]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1967), ''The Spanish Republic and The Civil War, 1931-1939.'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Bestiero had also opposed the participation of UGT in the 15 December 1930 general strike. At a joint meeting of the PSOE and UGT in February 1931, Besteiro resigned as President of both the party and the union. (Note: Paul Preston writes that Besteiro resigned as president of the union in 1934.&lt;ref name="preston71"&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, Revolution &amp; Revenge,'' Harper Perennial, 2006, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1931 he was elected a councillor of the Madrid town council.

==Second Spanish Republic and the Civil War==
Still serving in the [[Cortes Generales]] after the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in 1931, Besteiro was elected Speaker of the [[Constituent Cortes]], empowered to draft a new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War. 1936-1939.'' Penguin books. London. 2006. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The Cabinet offered him first the job of state delegate to [[CAMPSA]], the state petrol monopoly, and then the post of Ambassador to France, both of which he rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Coming of the Spanish Civil War: Reform, Reaction and Revolution in the Spanish Second Republic.'' Routledge. New York. 1994. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; During his period as President of the Cortes, he seemed to become more [[Conservatism|conservative]] in his political views. In January 1934, he resigned as President of the UGT.

Opposing the radicalization of the Socialist movement,&lt;ref name="preston71"/&gt; he disapproved the socialists' taking part in the armed uprising of [[Anarchism in Spain#Asturias|October 1934]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1967), ''The Spanish Republic and The Civil War'', p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1936, Besteiro won the highest number of votes of any candidate in Madrid in the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] elections.

Throughout this period, Besteiro had continued to work in the University of Madrid as a Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, as well as to carry out his duties as a parliamentary deputy and councillor of the town council in Madrid. After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, and against the urgings of friends, he refused to leave Madrid and seek exile.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt;

[[Manuel Azaña]], the Spanish Republican President, chose Besteiro as the representative to the coronation of the new British [[List of British monarchs#House of Windsor|King]] [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in London on 12 May 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006), ''The Battle for Spain'', p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; Besteiro believed it was to be a peace mission. There he met with Sir [[Anthony Eden]] to seek British aid in ending the war, which had attracted German and Russian support of the opposing sides, but no significant results followed.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1967), ''The Spanish Republic and The Civil War'', pp. 441-442&lt;/ref&gt; After the failure of his mission in London, Besteiro returned to work on the town council of Madrid but withdrew from other official public life. He stopped attending the ''Agrupación Socialista Madrileña'' and the parliamentary group meetings.

With the news of the fall of [[Barcelona]] on 26 January 1939 and Azaña's resignation as [[President of Spain|President of the Republic]], Besteiro decided to work to achieve peace and stop the resistance. He contacted Colonel [[Segismundo Casado]]. On 5 March Besteiros announced the [[Final offensive of the Spanish Civil War|creation]] of the [[National Defence Council (Spain)|National Defence Council]] (''Consejo Nacional de Defensa'').&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006), ''The Battle for Spain,'' pp. 391-392&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising against the government of [[Juan Negrín]] and its [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] allies succeeded, at the cost of nearly 2,000 lives. (See Beevor (2006), Chapter 34, ''passim,'' ''The Battle for Spain''.)&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006), ''The Battle for Spain'', p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After the fall of Madrid to the [[Nationalists]] on 28 March 1939, Besteiro was arrested by [[Francoist]] forces. On 8 July he faced a [[court martial]] and was sentenced to thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. 2001. p. 888&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned first in the [[Trappist]] monastery in [[Dueñas, Palencia]], until the end of August 1939. He was transferred to the prison of [[Carmona, Seville|Carmona]]. He died in prison the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (2006), ''The Spanish Civil War'', p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;

Besteiro was buried in the [[Cementerio Civil of Madrid]].

'''Keith Lehrer''' (born January 10, 1936) is Regent's Professor emeritus of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Arizona]] and a Research Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Miami]] in Florida, where he spends half of each academic year.

==Education and career==

Lehrer received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[philosophy]] from [[Brown University]] where he studied under [[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Richard Taylor]] and [[Roderick Chisholm]].  He joined the faculty at the University of Arizona in 1973, where he helped build a major graduate program.  Prior to that, he taught at the [[University of Rochester]].

His research interests include [[epistemology]],&lt;ref name="Olsson2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olsson|first=Erik J.|title=The epistemology of Keith Lehrer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5qdfk_zVTWwC&amp;pg=PP11|accessdate=7 September 2010|year=2003|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-1605-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[free will]], [[rational consensus]], [[Thomas Reid]] and, recently, [[aesthetics]].

Lehrer is a former president of the Pacific Division of the [[American Philosophical Association]] (APA) and also served as the APA executive director for a number of years.  He is an elected Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;http://uanews.org/story/ua-philosopher-honored&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrer, and his wife Adrienne Lehrer, are also artists. Their work has been on display at the Vincent Gallery in [[Coconut Grove]], [[Florida]], concurrent with his stay at the [[University of Miami]], where he was a visiting professor.

==Philosophical work==

Lehrer is best known for his defense of a coherentist theory of knowledge.  According to Lehrer, "a person is justified in accepting a proposition just in case that proposition coheres with the relevant part of her cognitive system."&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-coherence/#OthAccCoh&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrer's work, "Why Not Skepticism?" is used in many introductory philosophy courses as a coherent and readable introduction to the subject. He has authored seven books on philosophical subjects, and over 170 scholarly articles. Lehrer is perhaps best known for his defense of the [[coherentism|coherence]] [[theory of justification]] in epistemology. He is the originator of the widely discussed [http://faculty.fordham.edu/nballantyne/truetemp.html TrueTemp example].

'''Master–slave morality''' is a central theme of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works, in particular the first essay of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. Nietzsche argued that there were two fundamental types of [[morality]]: "master morality" and "slave morality". Master morality values pride and power, while slave morality values things like kindness, empathy, and sympathy. Master morality weighs actions on good or bad consequences (i. e., classical virtues and vices, [[consequentialism]]), unlike slave morality, which weighs actions on a scale of [[Good and evil|good or evil]] intentions (e. g., Christian virtues and vices, [[Kantian ethics|Kantian deontology]]).

For Nietzsche, a particular morality is inseparable from the formation of a particular culture, meaning that a culture's language, codes and practices, narratives, and institutions are informed by the struggle between these two moral structures (see [[Value theory|valuation]]).

==Master morality==
Nietzsche defined master morality as the morality of the strong-willed. Nietzsche criticizes the view (which he identifies with contemporary British ideology) that good is everything that is helpful, and bad is everything that is harmful. He argues proponents of this view have forgotten the origins of its values and it is based merely on a non-critical acceptance of habit: what is useful has always been defined as good, therefore usefulness is goodness as a value. He continues explaining that in the prehistoric state "the value or non-value of an action was derived from its consequences"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=62}} but ultimately "[t]here are no moral phenomena at all, only moral interpretations of phenomena."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=96}} For strong-willed men, the "good" is the noble, strong, and powerful, while the "bad" is the weak, cowardly, timid, and petty. 

The essence of master morality is ''nobility''. Other qualities that are often valued in master morality are open-mindedness, courage, truthfulness, trust, and an accurate sense of one's self-worth. Master morality begins in the "noble man", with a spontaneous idea of the good; then the idea of bad develops as what is not good. "The noble type of man experiences ''itself'' as determining values; it does not need approval; it judges, "what is harmful to me is harmful in itself"; it knows itself to be that which first accords honour to things; it is ''value-creating''."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=39}} In this sense, the master morality is the full recognition that ''oneself'' is the measure of all moral truths.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Insofar as something is helpful to the strong-willed man, it is like what he values in himself; therefore, the strong-willed man values such things as good because they aid him in a life-long process of [[self-actualization]] through the [[will to power]].

==Slave morality==

According to Nietzsche, masters are creators of morality; slaves respond to master morality with their slave morality. Unlike master morality, which is sentiment, slave morality is based on [[ressentiment|re-sentiment]]—devaluing that which the master values and the slave does not have. As master morality originates in the strong, slave morality originates in the weak. Because slave morality is a reaction to oppression, it vilifies its oppressors. Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism. Slave morality is created in opposition to what master morality values as "good". 

Slave morality does not aim at exerting one's will by strength, but by careful subversion. It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. The essence of slave morality is ''utility'':{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=122}} The good is what is most useful for the whole community, not just the strong. Nietzsche saw this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few in number, compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery (viz., the [[will to power]]) are "evil", as are the qualities the weak originally could not choose because of their weakness. By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master. [[Biblical]] principles of humility, charity, and pity are the result of universalizing the plight of the slave onto all humankind, and thus enslaving the masters as well. "The ''democratic'' movement is the heir to [[Christianity]]"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=125}}—the political manifestation of slave morality because of its obsession with freedom and equality.

{{quote|...the Jews achieved that miracle of inversion of values thanks to which life on earth has for a couple millennia acquired a new and dangerous fascination - their prophets fused "rich", "godless", "evil", "violent", "sensual" into one, and were the first to coin the word "world" as a term of infamy. It is this inversion of values (with which is involved the employment of the word for "poor" as a synonym for "holy" and "friend") that the significance of the Jewish people resides: With ''them'', there begins the ''slave revolt in morals''.{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=118}}}}

==Society==

This struggle between master and slave moralities recurs historically. According to Nietzsche, ancient Greek and Roman societies were grounded in master morality. The [[Homer]]ic hero is the strong-willed man, and the classical roots of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' exemplified Nietzsche's master morality. He calls the heroes "men of a noble culture",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=153}} giving a substantive example of master morality. Historically, master morality was defeated, as the slave morality of Judaism and Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire. 

The essential struggle between cultures has always been between the Roman (master, strong) and the Judean (slave, weak). Nietzsche condemns the triumph of slave morality in the West, saying that the democratic movement is the "''collective degeneration of man''".{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=127}} He claimed that the nascent democratic movement of his time was essentially slavish and weak.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Weakness conquered strength, slave conquered master, re-sentiment conquered sentiment. This [[ressentiment]] Nietzsche calls "priestly vindictiveness",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=19}} which is based on the jealous weak seeking to enslave the strong, and thus erode the basis for power itself by pulling the powerful down. Such movements were, according to Nietzsche, inspired by "the most intelligent revenge" of the weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals: A Polemic. By Way of Clarification and Supplement to My Last Book Beyond Good and Evil|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-953708-2|location=|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche saw democracy and Christianity as the same emasculating impulse which sought to make everyone equal by making everyone a slave.{{Cn|date=January 2017}}

Nietzsche did not necessarily believe that everyone should adopt master morality as the "be-all, end-all" behavior. He thought that the [[Transvaluation of values|revaluation of morals]] would correct the inconsistencies in both master and slave moralities. But he asserted that for the individual, master morality was preferable to slave morality. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] disagrees that Nietzsche actually preferred master morality to slave morality. He certainly gives slave morality a more thorough critique, but this is partly because he thought of slave morality as society's more imminent danger.{{citation needed|reason=Sentence is vaguely worded and lacks documentation.|date=October 2015}}

'''Muhammad Mustafa Jauhar''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|محمد مصطفٰی جوہر}}}}) (10 May 1895 – 24 October 1985) was a [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] [[scholar]], religious leader, public speaker, poet and [[philosopher]]. He wrote many books on different Uloom. He died on 24 October 1985.

==Biography==
Jauhar was born in [[Bihar]], [[India]]. He was the eldest son of Hakeem Muhammad Muslim, who used to run his clinic{{Vague|date=July  2012}} in [[Bhagalpur]] during 1910, where Jauhar studied in an English School. Later he gained admission to [[Sultanul Madaris]], and completed his education from [[Sultanul Madaris]] [[Lucknow]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="ferozsons"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ferozsons.com.pk/first.php?val=40# |title=Khursheed-e-Khawar by Hujjat-ul-Islam Maulana Saeed Akhtar from India...

==Madrassa Abbasia (Patna, British India) ==

[[Madrassa]] Abbasia was inaugurated in 1923 by Muhammad Baqir. Jauhar was appointed as its first Naib Mudarris-e-Alla on August 1925. He became Mudarris-e-Alla of the [[madrassa]] in January 1926. He called Abul Hassan to [[Patna]] and appointed him as the Naib Mudarris-e- Alla in the [[Madrassa]].

==English==
Jauhar had a good command of the [[English language]]. Once, when he was afflicted with an itching skin disease, he felt that he could not remain ritually pure, so he restrained himself from studying the [[Quran]] and other religious books for some time. Instead he decided to read an English translation of [[Alif Laila]]. By the time he recovered from the disease he had already finished the book and strengthened his expertise in English.&lt;ref name="ferozsons"/&gt;

==Literary work==
Study was the essence of Jauhari's life. He was considered an authority on Uloom-e-Falsafa o mantaq &amp; [[Sufi metaphysics]]. He wrote many books, including:

* ''[[Tauheed]] o adal [[Nahj al-Balagha]] ki raushani main''
* ''Aqaid-e-Jaafria''
* ''Asool-e-Jaafria''
* ''Saboot-e-Khuda''
* ''Janab'' kay tareekhi khutba fidak ka tarjuma which is included in Seerat-e-[[Fatima Zahra]] by Agha Sultan Ahmad Mirza
* Translation of AL [[Ghadeer]] (Volume 1)

'''''No Way to Heaven''''' is a 2008 documentary feature about people allegedly living on light ([[Breatharianism]]), directed and produced by Swiss filmmakers Janos Tedeschi and Christof Schaefer. It is the world’s very first full-length film on this topic.

''No Way to Heaven'' premiered in Switzerland in January 2008. The film had theatrical release in Switzerland in January 2009 and went on to screen in Estonia and the Netherlands.

==Synopsis==
''No Way to Heaven'' begins on a remote island in Southeast Asia. There, Fritz Joss, a young man from the Swiss mountains has decided to stop eating – once and for all. He plans to find sustenance in pure (sun-)light by applying what is known as the "21 day process". Fritz sets off on his endeavour, but the planned conversion to "breatharianism" is much more difficult than anticipated.

==Cast==
The film features encounters with the following characters:
* Fritz Joss, a young Swiss yogi who stops eating and drinking by applying the "21-day process".
* [[Inedia#Prahlad Jani .28.22Mataji.22.29|Prahlad Jani]], an 82-year ascetic Hindu, who for 74 years has survived allegedly without food and liquid.
* A team of doctors, headed by [[Inedia#2003 Tests|Prof. Dr. Sudhir Shah]], a neurologist and respected scientist at Sterling Hospital Ahmedabad, India, who have conducted several case studies on breatharianism, most notably with Prahlad Jani in 2004 and 2010.
* Niranjan Bhagat, who gazes at the sun ([[sungazing]]) every day for 45 minutes and hence claims does not need to eat.
* Sanjay Padhiyar, a 110-year-old Indian saint, who tells the story of how she forgot to eat during several years of meditation, living as a recluse in a cave in northern India.

DVD Extras:

* [[Jasmuheen]], an Australian esoteric teacher and author, who introduced breatharianism (and the 21-day process) in her best-selling book "Living on Light" to Western audiences in the late 90s.
* Dr. Michael Werner, a German chemist, anthroposophist and author of "Leben durch Lichtnahrung", himself a breatharian of multiple years.
* [[Inedia#2003 Tests|Prof. Dr. Sudhir Shah]] (extended interview).
* Swami Vivekananda Saraswati, a prominent yogi and teacher of Fritz Joss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11991">'''Olivier Auber''' (born 1960) is a French independent artist and researcher. He is best known for his project "[[Poietic Generator]]" and for having introduced the concept of "Digital Perspective" in the fields of network theory, art and [[digital humanities]].

==Biography==
Olivier Auber was born in 1960 in [[Sainte-Adresse]] in [[Normandy]], [[France]]. He lives and works in Paris and Brussels.

He holds an engineering degree and a Master of Design from the [[Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts et Métiers]]. His engineering thesis focused on nonlinear optical elements (holograms) for avionics ([[head-up display]]). This initial specialization in optics has earned him early in his career as a research engineer, first in the avionics division of Thomson Csf (now [[Thales Group]]) and at [[CERN]] in Geneva.

In 1984, he takes the status of independent consulting engineer for the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] (Paris), then under construction, to work first on the development of exhibits, then quickly as project manager responsible for the design and development of several permanent and temporary exhibitions. As such, between 1984 and 1996, he designed the scenario and led the implementation of several highly technological exhibitions and media on science issues as diverse as: the sun, mathematics, electricity, symmetry in the arts and science, non-verbal human behavior, etc. In this period, he also developed some exhibition projects for other cultural institutions, such as the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]], the [[Palais de la Découverte]]. The creation for the "Expressions et behaviours" exhibition inaugurated in early 1987, marked a milestone in his career, leading him from a predominantly scientific and technical culture to another more artistic and open to all components of the humanities.

End of 1987, while working with [[Tod Machover]] (MIT Medialab) and Catherine Ikam (artist) for the staging of VALIS, a contemporary music opera based on the work of [[Philip K. Dick]], he designed what would become his best known work, the "[[Poietic Generator]]", a free social artwork for all that can be played in real time over a network. In 1988, this work became the central concept of a monumental, architectural and technological project, one of the seven laureates of the international competition for the creation of the "France-Japan Monument" on [[Awaji Island]] in the Bay of [[Kobe]], launched under the aegis of [[François Mitterrand]]. This Monument never saw the daylight, but its various implementations were exhibited at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] (exhibition "Communication et Monumentalité", 1989), the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] (exhibition "Machines à communiquer", 1994) and in various galleries and art events including [http://www.arslab.it ARSLAB] in 1995, where Olivier Auber was awarded the prize "art and science" by the city of Turin, Italy. The exhibition "ARSLAB - The senses of virtuality", sponsored by the City of [[Turin]] - Promoter of Fine Arts, was organized by Ars Technica and Extramuseum and was curated by Claude Faure, Maria Grazia Mattei and Franco Torriani &lt;ref name= catalogue1&gt;1995, ''Arslab. The senses of virtual'', published by RCS Libri &amp; Grandi Opere Spa, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= catalogue2&gt;1998, ''Arslab. I labirinti del corpo in gioco.'' published by hopefulmonster, Turin, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= catalogue3&gt;1995, ''Arslab. The senses of virtuality'', published by RCS Libri &amp; Grandi Opere Spa, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 still, he was invited to the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications (now [[Télécom ParisTech]]) to develop his project, not just on the web, but on an experimental network foreshadowing the future shape of the Internet ([[Mbone]]) which allowed him to perform what is considered as the first experience of real-time collective interaction over the Internet without the intermediary of any center.

In 1996, he developed a version of [[Poietic Generator]] for the web in order to let every one access to it. Several experiments followed through electronic art festivals and academic research: Ljubljana (1998), X-00 (2000), Human-Computer Interaction Conference IHM-UTC(2002, L3D Lab, University of Colorado at Boulder in (2002), and so on.

In 1997 he co-founded the [http://km2.net/ A+H Culture Laboratory], with Bernd Hoge (architect and urban planner), Emmanuel Mâa Berriet (developer of virtual reality) and Philippe Braunstein (film producer), in order to develop interdisciplinary projects. One of the first is the creation of the [[:de:Nibelungenmuseum Worms|Nibelungen Museum]] in Worms Germany. One of the pieces in the museum, the virtual reality installation "The treasure of the Nibelungs", inspired by the [[Poietic Generator]], was also exhibited in numerous festivals, including ISEA 2000 (Paris) and Boston CyberArts 2001.

In 2002, he co-founded with Nils Aziosmanoff and Etienne Krieger the company Navidis&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navidis.com/ Navidis, innovative solutions to the Smart Cities]&lt;/ref&gt; which brings innovative solutions to the Smart City users.

In 2004, he co-founded with visual artist Yann Le Guennec the research group Anoptique that developed dataviz experiences on the Internet. In this regard were conducted several projects in partnership with the Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération (FING), Orange Lab/France Telecom R&amp;D and INRIA, which led from 2005 on the development of many visualization tools. Anoptique commonly advised organizations such as UNESCO, the Ministry of Culture, the French Development Agency on their strategy of free software, groupware, interactive mapping and open data.

In 2010 and 2011, he contributed to the creation of a transdisciplinary Research Chair&lt;ref&gt;[http://imaginaires.telecom-paristech.fr/ Research Chair "modeling imaginary"]&lt;/ref&gt; at Telecom ParisTech devoted to "modeling imaginary" with the help of [[Dassault Systèmes]], [[Ubisoft]], Orange Lab, [[Peugeot-Citroen]], [[Alcatel Lucent]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Datar]] and [[Minatec]].

Since 2012, Olivier Auber divides his time between consultancy, design of cultural and art projects, and research and development on the [[Poietic Generator]]. He also contributes to many working groups, as a research associate of the transdisciplinary research group "Evolution, Complexity and Cognition"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecco.vub.ac.be/ Research group on "Evolution, Complexity and Cognition (ECCO)"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Global Brain Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalbraininstitute.org Global Brain Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Francis Heylighen]], and as an active member of the [[P2P Foundation]].

==Theoretical arguments==

From 1986, Olivier Auber theorized the [[Poietic Generator]] as an experience of two new kinds of perspectives, analogous to the spatial perspective of the Renaissance: the "temporal perspective" and the "digital perspective", on which he wrote several papers&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : ''Du Générateur poïétique à la perspective numérique'', Revue d'esthétique 43 - 07/2003 - p. 127, oline on [http://archee.qc.ca/ar.php?page=imp&amp;no=207 Archée, Québec], "The Aestetic of the Digital Perspective", Artmedia VIII,
Paris, 2002 ([http://vv.arts.ucla.edu/publications/publications/02-03/Artmedia/PARTICIPANTSe.htm arts.ucla.edu])&lt;/ref&gt; whose terms were continued in the works of many philosophers and historians of art and science, including Anne Cauquelin,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Anne Cauquelin|Anne Cauquelin]]: ''Fréquenter les incorporels'', PUF, collection « Lignes d'art », 2006.

{{Precedence}}
'''Order of precedence''' is a sequential hierarchy of nominal importance of persons. Most often it is used in the context of people by many organizations and governments, for very formal and state occasions, especially where [[diplomat]]s are present. It can also be used in the context of decorations, medals and awards. Historically, the order of precedence had a more widespread use, especially in [[Royal court|court]] and aristocratic life.

A person's position in an order of [[:wikt:precedence|precedence]] is not necessarily an indication of functional importance, but rather an indication of [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] or historical relevance; for instance, it may dictate where dignitaries are seated at formal dinners.  The term is occasionally used to mean the [[order of succession]]—to determine who replaces the [[head of state]] in the event he or she is removed from office or incapacitated—as they are often identical, at least near the top.

What follows are the general orders of precedence for different countries for state purposes, such as diplomatic dinners, and are made under the assumption that such functions are held in the capital. When they are held in another city or region, local officials such as governors would be much higher up the order.  There may also be more specific and local orders of precedence, for particular occasions or within particular institutions.  [[University|Universities]] and the [[Profession|professions]] often have their own rules of precedence applying locally, based (for example) on university or professional rank, each rank then being ordered within itself on the basis of seniority (i.e. date of attaining that rank). Within an institution the officials of that institution are likely to rank much higher in the order than in a general order of precedence—the chancellor or president of a university may well precede anyone except a head of state for example. The same might be true for a mayor in his or her own city.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to humanism:

'''[[Humanism]]''' &amp;ndash; group of philosophies and ethical perspectives which emphasize the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers individual thought and evidence (rationalism, empiricism), over established doctrine or faith (fideism). Two common forms of humanism are religious humanism and [[secular humanism]].

'''Humanism,''' term freely applied to a variety of beliefs, methods, and philosophies that place central emphasis on the human realm. Most frequently, however, the term is used with reference to a system of education and mode of inquiry that developed in northern Italy during the 13th and 14th centuries and later spread through continental Europe and England. Alternately known as Renaissance humanism, this program was so broadly and profoundly influential that it is one of the chief reasons why the Renaissance is viewed as a distinct historical period. Indeed, though the word Renaissance is of more recent coinage, the fundamental idea of that period as one of renewal and reawakening is humanistic in origin. But humanism sought its own philosophical bases in far earlier times and, moreover, continued to exert some of its power long after the end of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = humanism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/humanism|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*

== Nature of humanism ==
Humanism can be described as all of the following:
* Approach &amp;ndash; manner in which a problem is solved or policy is made.
* Branch of [[philosophy]] &amp;ndash; study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on rational argument.
* [[Social movement]] &amp;ndash; type of group action. A large informal grouping of individuals or organization which focuses on specific political or social issues. In other words, it carries out, resists or undoes a social change.
** Ethical movement &amp;ndash;
** [[Philosophical movement]] &amp;ndash; either the appearance or increased popularity of a specific school of philosophy, or a fairly broad but identifiable sea-change in philosophical thought on a particular subject.

== Branches of humanism ==
* [[Religious humanism]] &amp;ndash; philosophy that integrates secular ethics with religious rituals and beliefs that center on human needs, interests, and abilities.
** [[Buddhist humanism]] &amp;ndash; philosophical perspective based on the teaching of inherent dignity of all human beings, their potential for attaining highest wisdom about their condition &lt;ref&gt;http://www.daisakuikeda.org/main/philos/buddhist/buddh-05.html&lt;/ref&gt; and their essential nature of altruism exemplified by the [[Bodhisattva]] spirit of compassion.&lt;ref&gt;http://zenbuddhisttemple.org/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; In practical terms, humanism is expressed on the individual level through action: to “relieve sufferings and impart joy”,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iop.or.jp/0515/ikeda_unger.pdf, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; to contribute to the welfare of society,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jones/wheel285.html&lt;/ref&gt; abiding by the attitude of [[nonviolence]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wabashcenter.wabash.edu/syllabi/g/gier/306/gbnd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; supporting [[human rights]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buddhanetz.org/texte/rights.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and acting for [[world peace]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uthumanist.com/2011/02/secular-ethics-necessary-for-world.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iop.or.jp/1121/Journal21_Y.Kawada1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; effectively advocating the concept of [[global citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbia.edu/cu/buddhism/document/tc1996.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Christian humanism]] &amp;ndash; emphasizes the humanity of Jesus, his social teachings and his propensity to synthesize human spirituality and materialism. It regards humanist principles like universal human dignity and individual freedom and the primacy of human happiness as essential and principal components of, or at least compatible with, the teachings of Jesus Christ.
*** [[Christian existential humanism]] &amp;ndash; theo-philosophical movement which takes an existentialist approach to Christian theology.
** [[Humanistic Judaism]] &amp;ndash; movement in Judaism that offers a nontheistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life. It defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people and encourages humanistic and secular Jews to celebrate their Jewish identity by participating in Jewish holidays and life cycle events (such as weddings and bar and bat mitzvah) with inspirational ceremonies that draw upon but go beyond traditional literature.
* [[Secular humanism]] &amp;ndash; philosophy or life stance that embraces human reason, ethics, social justice and philosophical naturalism, whilst specifically rejecting religious dogma, supernaturalism, pseudoscience or superstition as the basis of morality and decision making.&lt;ref name="americanhumanist"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Humanism?|author=Edwords, Fred|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/What_is_Humanism|year=1989|publisher=American Humanist Association|accessdate=2009-08-19|quote=Secular Humanism is an outgrowth of eighteenth century enlightenment rationalism and nineteenth century freethought...

&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively known by some adherents as Humanism, specifically with a capital H to distinguish it from other forms of humanism
** [[Personism]] &amp;ndash; ethical philosophy of personhood as typified by the thought of the preference utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer.&lt;ref&gt;''Rethinking Peter Singer: a Christian Critique'', by Gordon R. Preece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Applied ethics: a non-consequentialist approach'', by David S. Oderberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Humanism and Personism: The false philosophy of Peter Singer'', by Jenny Teichman&lt;/ref&gt; It amounts to a branch of secular humanism with an emphasis on certain rights-criteria.&lt;ref name=SingerBeyond&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=Taking Humanism Beyond Speciesism|journal=Free Inquiry|date=Oct–Nov 2004|volume=24|issue=6|pages=19–21|url=http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/200410--.htm|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Posthumanism]] &amp;ndash; "after humanism" or "beyond humanism". It has at least 5 contexts, and may refer to:
*** Ideas concerning the [[Posthuman#Posthumanism|Posthuman condition]] &amp;ndash; the [[deconstruction]] of the [[human condition]] by [[critical theory|critical theorists]].&lt;ref name="Hayles 1999"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[N.

** [[Outline of transhumanism|Transhumanism]] &amp;ndash; international intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally transforming the human condition by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.  That is, striving to become posthuman.  According to transhumanist thinkers, a posthuman is a hypothetical future being "whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no longer unambiguously human by our current standards."&lt;ref name="World Transhumanist Association 2002-2005"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[World Transhumanist Association]]| title = The transhumanist FAQ| date = 2002–2005| url = http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/FAQv21.pdf| accessdate = 2006-08-27| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061231225013/http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/FAQv21.pdf| archivedate = 31 December 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patrick Edward Dove''' (31 July 1815 – 28 April 1873) was born at [[Lasswade]], near [[Edinburgh]] in Scotland. He is mainly remembered for his book ''The Theory of Human Progression'' of 1850 which sets out his philosophy that land should be in common ownership, with the ''[[economic rent]]'' on the land taking the place of other taxes, an idea generally known as [[Georgism]].

==Early life ==
Patrick Dove came from a family of distinguished clergymen and landowners. He was descended from Sir William Dove of [[Upton, Cambridgeshire|Upton]], near [[Peterborough]] (son of Bishop Thomas Dove). His branch of the family had connections with the [[Royal Navy]] going back to 1716 when they moved to [[Devon]] where the family still live. His father, Lieutenant Henry Dove RN, retired from active service with the Navy at the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]] in 1815, taking up an appointment at [[Deal, Kent]] connected with the [[Cinque Ports]]. Edward was educated in England and in France, where he was expelled from the Academy for leading a rebellion against the master. He greatly desired a career in the navy, but his father would not allow this and in 1830 Edward was sent to Scotland to learn farming. Following this he spent time in Paris, in Spain and in London, where he impressed a friend by his "enormous energy, both physical and mental".

In 1841 he took the ''Craig'' estate near [[Ballantrae]], Ayrshire, and lived the quiet life of a country gentleman. He was a first-rate horseman, took up fly-fishing and sailing, was an excellent shot and showed mechanical abilities, contributing the article on gunmaking to the 8th edition of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. As well as becoming an agricultural adviser to neighbouring farmers, during the potato famine he put his energies into providing work for his starving neighbours. Since he disapproved of the game laws, he had no [[gamekeeper]] on his estate to stop [[poaching]]. &lt;!--confirmation needed: Another peculiarity was his friendship for Ireland. He stood up stoutly for the Irish peasantry and denounced Britain's treatment of it.--&gt;

An unfortunate investment led to him losing most of his fortune in 1848, then in 1849 he married Ann Forrester, daughter of an Edinburgh solicitor. They spent the next year in [[Darmstadt]], Germany, where he continued his interest in philosophy; studying, lecturing and writing.

==''The Theory of Human Progression''==
While Dove was still in Darmstadt, his book ''The Theory of Human Progression, and Natural Probability of a Reign of Justice'' was published anonymously in 1850 as a limited edition, both in London and Edinburgh. This was to be the first part of a treatise on "a Science of politics", defining science as "nature seen by the reason, and not merely by the senses. Science exists in the mind, and in the mind alone." In it he set out his thesis that "the land produces, according to the law of the Creator, more than the value of the labor expended upon it, and on this account men are willing to pay a rent for the land", this rent being "the profit that God had graciously been pleased to accord to human industry employed in the cultivation of the soil". He saw the land as a gift of the Creator to all men, which should therefore be common rather than private property, but dividing the land into equal shares would be impractical, so the rent should be shared in common, effectively replacing all other taxes.

The book was praised by [[Thomas Carlyle]] as the voice of a new revolution in education and economics, and the philosopher [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]] spoke of it rallying mankind to great reforms. [[Charles Sumner]] had copies made and circulated them in the United States, subsequently persuading Dove to write an article opposing slavery titled ''The Elder and Younger Brother'' which appeared in the ''Boston Commonwealth'' on 21 September 1853. Despite such praise the book was not a popular success, however some scholarly interest continued. In 1884 [[Henry George]] praised the book at a public meeting in [[Glasgow]], and Dove is now seen as a forerunner of the idea known as [[Georgism]].

===Intelligent design===
The index and heading to page 476&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?as_brr=1&amp;id=VYRLq_L4YkkC&amp;vid=OCLC18266918&amp;dq=%22Intelligent+design%22&amp;pg=PA476&amp;lpg=PA476&amp;q=evolution Page 476]&lt;/ref&gt; uses the words ''Intelligence – intelligent design'', and this is now seen as one of the first uses of the term [[intelligent design]] which has lately been revived by an anti-[[evolution]] movement. However Dove does not discuss biological evolution, though ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' had brought ideas of [[transmutation of species]] to public attention in 1844, and uses the term ''evolution'' to refer to the development of "a genuine [[natural theology]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC18266918&amp;id=VYRLq_L4YkkC&amp;pg=PA484&amp;vq=evolution&amp;dq=%22Intelligent+design%22&amp;as_brr=1 Page 484]&lt;/ref&gt; He reasons that intuitive perception of a "primordial force" in the works of nature, if only matter is thought to be ''objective'', leads to [[pantheism]], "the theological credence of a large portion of the scientific men on the continent". This appears to refer to the ideas of [[Physical law|natural laws]] put forward by writers such as [[Auguste Comte]] which had influenced the [[Inception of Darwin's theory#Malthus and natural law|inception of Darwin's theory]], a theory which would not be made public until 1858. Dove contends that to achieve a "scientific exit" from pantheism the "primordial force" must be perceived as an intelligent agent, then notes that the adaption of matter for the achievement of ends has been called ''design'', a reference to the natural theology of the day.

==Further work==
Dove moved from Germany back to [[Edinburgh]], where he gave lectures at the ''Philosophical Institution'', the subject in 1853 being ''Heroes of the Commonwealth''. In succeeding years he lectured on ''The Wild Sports of Scotland'' and ''The Crusades''. In April 1853 he became captain of the ''Midlothian Rifle Club'', and in 1854 as well as editing the ''Witness'' during the illness of a friend, he published the second volume of his treatise, ''Elements of Political Science''. This was followed by ''Romanism, Rationalism and Protestant'' in defence of [[Protestantism]]. He then wrote the concluding third volume of his treatise which remained unpublished and has been lost.

He published ''The Logic of the Christian Faith'', then in 1858 ''The Revolver'' which suggests ideas for rifle clubs and defence of the country as well as lamenting the [[Highland clearances]]. That year he moved to [[Glasgow]] and edited the ''Commonwealth'' newspaper as well as the ''[[Imperial Dictionary of Biography]]'' and jointly edited the ''Imperial Journal of the Arts and Sciences''. He also wrote the Encyclopædia Britannica article on ''Government'' and devised a rifled cannon with advantages in range and accuracy, but was unable to afford further testing which the ordnance committee requested. He took command of the 91st Lanarkshire rifle volunteers in 1859 and in the next year won several prizes at the first meeting of the [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom|National Rifle Association]] at [[Wimbledon and Putney Commons|Wimbledon Common]], but then suffered a stroke causing paralysis. In May 1862 he went to convalesce in the [[Colony of Natal]], South Africa, returning the following April, then died a year later. By this time slavery in the United States had been abolished.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7578">'''Professional courtesy''' generally refers to a philosophy of particular professional behavior or etiquette which is extended between members of the same profession. The concept of professional courtesy is believed to have originated within the ancient practice of medicine by where physicians provided services to other physicians without charge. However, the philosophy does not necessarily involve the same courtesy across all professions. Nor is professional courtesy a mandated privilege, but is freely given at the discretion of the party extending the courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cji.edu/site/assets/files/1921/professionalcourtesy.pdf|title=Professional Courtesy Ethics in Policing|last=McVay|first=Jerold A.|date=2012-04-22|website=Crim. Justice Institute|publisher=Univ. of Arkansas|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the etiquette is not limited to physicians, the medical profession is likely the oldest and most well known for having such a long-standing tradition of professional courtesy among its professionals. Some other well known groups who have some form of professional courtesy also include attorneys, performing arts, and law enforcement. The phrase may also be applied in a literal form, such as the required ethical behavior of lawyers towards each other.&lt;ref name="KBA"&gt;{{cite web| title = Code of Professional Courtesy| work = Kentucky Bar Association| url = http://www.kybar.org/Default.aspx?tabid=228| accessdate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In medicine==
In 1803, [[Thomas Percival]] wrote his classic essay on medical ethics which endorsed complimentary professional care to “All members of the profession, including apothecaries as well as physicians and surgeons, together with their wives and children, should be attended gratuitously.” In 1847, the American Medical Association’s Code of Ethics similarly endorsed withholding charges for services to other physicians and their families,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; known as professional courtesy. This is likely the first modern day documentation of the philosophy.

Among [[physician]]s, it has been historically traditional to provide medical care at no or reduced cost to physician colleagues and their immediate family members.&lt;ref name="ama"&gt;{{cite web| title = AMA Code of Medical Ethics, E-6.13, Professional Courtesy| work = | url = http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion613.page?| accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original purpose of this was to discourage physicians from treating themselves and members of their own family.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Jones, MD, PhD, MHA|first = James|last2 = McCullough, PhD|first2 = Laurence|last3 = Richman, MA|first3 = Bruce|date = 2004-05-01|title = Ethics of Professional Courtesy|url = http://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(04)00144-2/pdf|journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery|volume = 39|issue = 5|pages = 1140–1141|doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2004.01.035|pmid =|lay-url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom dates back to [[Hippocrates]],&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;Rathbun, Katharine C., M.D.; Richards, Edward P. III, J.D.; ''Professional Courtesy''; Missouri Medicine; 1998;95:18-20; [http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Articles/Professional_Courtesy.html (on-line)].&lt;/ref&gt; well before physicians reached middle-class income levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, physicians regularly providing free or reduced rate services as professional courtesy must remain mindful in the age of copays, insurance only billing, and referrals, the practice can run afoul of the law under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hawleytroxell.com/2011/12/professional-courtesy-problems/|title = Professional Courtesy Problems - Hawley Troxell - Health Law|last =|first =|date =|year = 2011|publisher = Hawley Troxell - Health Law|access-date = 2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the American Medical Association issued a Code of Medical Ethics Opinion advising free of charge and reduced rate services was not an ethical requirement, and physicians should use their own judgment in deciding to extend such professional courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion613.page?|title=Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 6.13 - Professional Courtesy|last=|first=|date=1994-06-01|website=American Medical Association|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law enforcement ==
The term has been used to refer to the practice by law enforcement officers allowing other officers to engage in traffic violations and some crimes without being reported or arrested. There are three tools that law enforcement officers use to implement "professional courtesy":

First, some states (such as [[California]]) issue "confidential [[Vehicle registration plate|plate]]s" to employees in law enforcement, and other public officials. The plates keep identities and addresses anonymous, allowing employees the inadvertent ability to travel on toll-ways without charge.&lt;ref name = "Corrupt"&gt;{{cite web| title = Special license plates shield officials from traffic tickets| work = ocregister.com|url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dmv-police-confidential-2011354-program-records | accessdate = 2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even serious offences such as drunk driving are subject to professional courtesy "discretion", and [[federal law]] assists in the process by exempting police officers and firefighters from a federal law that requires truck drivers to be blood-tested after an accident.&lt;ref name = "DUI Cops"&gt;{{cite news| title = A broken system works in favor of cops busted for DUI| work = seattlepi.com|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/specials/undueinfluence/326446_dui06.html | accessdate = 2009-06-02| first1=Eric| last1=Nalder| first2=Lewis| last2=Kamb| first3=P-I| last3=Investigative| date=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, there is a web site offering law enforcement employees the purchase of a "family card" they can give to friends and family to produce at, for example, a traffic stop to identify them to the officer as a family member.  Anti-police groups and people wary of the ethical actions of police officers purport that where an ordinary member of the public would get a ticket this notification card will cause the officer to overlook any violations of the law the person may have made and tell them to go on their way.&lt;ref name = "police"&gt;{{cite web| title = Professional Courtesy| work = NJLawman.com|url = http://njlawman.com/Feature%20Pieces/Professional%20Courtesy.htm| accessdate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vendor of this card is explicit about the intention behind these cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leoprocards.com/|title=LEOProCards|work=|accessdate=2012-08-05}}http://leoprocards.com/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619001525/http://leoprocards.com/ |date=2012-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In theater ==
Until the 1960s it was customary for theater managements to permit members of [[Actors' Equity Association|Actors Equity]] and other members of the profession into Broadway shows for free. This practice continues in the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] world where members of Equity must be admitted free of charge to any Showcase production in which there is a member of the union in the cast if there are seats left at curtain time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actorsequity.org AEA website]&lt;/ref&gt; This applies as well to ''bona fide'' producers, directors and casting directors, who do not have to wait until showtime to be seated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4155">'''Richard of Lavenham''' ([[fl.]] 1380) was an English [[Carmelite]], known as a scholastic philosopher. He is now remembered for his approach to the [[problem of future contingents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dov M.

==Life==
He was born at [[Lavenham]], [[Suffolk]], and, after becoming a Carmelite friar at [[Ipswich]], studied at the [[University of Oxford]], where he is said to have graduated D.D.; but in the colophon to his tract against [[John Purvey]] he is called simply 'magister'. 

Lavenham was later prior of the Carmelite house at [[Bristol]].

==Works==
Lavenham enjoyed a reputation as a theologian and schoolman. [[John Bale]] gives a list of sixty-one treatises ascribed to him, De Villiers names sixty-two, and Davy sixty-three. In [[Sloane MS.]] 3899 (fourteenth century) there are twenty-four short treatises by Lavenham on logical subjects ('De Propositionibus,' 'De Terminis,' &amp;c.). Other extant works ascribed to Lavenham are: 

* 'In Revelationes S. Brigittæ Lib. vii.' in MS. Reg. 7, C. ix, in the [[British Library]], a folio volume of the fifteenth century; the fourth book is also in Bodl. MS. 169 in the [[Bodleian Library]]. De Villiers describes this work as 'Determinationes notabiles Oxonii et Londini lectæ'
* 'Contra Johannem Purveium,' heresies extracted from Purvey's 'Ecclesiæ Regimen,' printed in 'Fasciculi Zizaniorum,' pp.&amp;nbsp;383–99.
* 'Super Prædicamentis,' in Digby MS. 77, f. 191 b, mutilated at the end, inc. 'Tractaturus de Decem Generibus.'
* 'Speculum Naturale sive super viii. lib. Physicorum;' a copy, which was formerly in the Carmelite Library at Oxford, went to [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] where it was styled 'Commentarius super viii. libros Aristotelis Physicorum, qui dicitur supplementum Lavenham.' [[Thomas Tanner (bishop)|Thomas Tanner]] ascribed this work both to Richard and to a Thomas Lavenham, who was in 1447 one of the first fellows of All Souls' College.
* 'De Septem Peccatis Mortalibus,' an English treatise beginning 'Crist yt deyde upon ye crosse.' In [[Harleian MS.]] 211, ff. 35 a–46 b, an early fifteenth-century manuscript, with a contemporary ascription to Lavenham.
* 'De Gestis et Translationibus sanctorum trium regum de Colonia,' ascribed to Lavenham by a late hand in Laud. MS. Misc. 525 in the Bodleian. This is in fact a once famous work by [[John of Hildesheim]] (fl. 1370), a German Carmelite; but there were several English translations, and Lavenham may have been the author of one of these. The Latin and two English versions were edited by C. Horstmann for the [[Early English Text Society]] in 1886.

Among the other treatises given by De Villiers are 'Abbreviationes Bedæ' (it has been suggested that this is the abbreviation printed by [[Abraham Wheloc]] in his edition of Bede), 'Compendium Gualteri Reclusi' (perhaps [[Walter Hilton]]), 'De Fundatione sui Ordinis,' a treatise called 'Clypeus Paupertatis' (suggesting Lavenham had taken part in the controversy concerning evangelical poverty), a commentary on Aristotle's 'Ethics,' tracts on physics and astronomy ('De Cœlo et Mundo,' '[[De Proprietatibus Elementorum]]'), together with 'Quæstiones,' sermons, and similar works.

'''Samkhya''' or '''Sankhya''' ({{lang-sa|[[:wikt:सांख्य|सांख्य]]}}, [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|sāṃkhya}}'') is one of the six [[Āstika and nāstika|āstika]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen, Theory and Practice of Yoga, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 100-101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Samkhya", American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition (2011), Quote: "'''Samkhya is a system of Hindu philosophy based on a dualism involving the ultimate principles of soul and matter.'''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Samkhya", Webster’s College Dictionary (2010), Random House, {{ISBN|978-0375407413}}, Quote: "'''Samkhya is a system of Hindu philosophy stressing the reality and duality of spirit and matter'''."&lt;/ref&gt; It is most related to the [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school of [[Hinduism]], and it was influential on other schools of Indian philosophy.&lt;ref name=royper&gt;Roy Perrett, Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges, Volume 1 (Editor: P Bilimoria et al), Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pages 149-158&lt;/ref&gt; Sāmkhya is an [[enumeration]]ist philosophy whose [[epistemology]] accepts three of six [[pramana]]s (proofs) as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge. These include ''pratyakṣa'' ([[perception]]), ''anumāṇa'' ([[inference]]) and ''śabda'' (''āptavacana'', word/testimony of reliable sources).&lt;ref name="Lpage9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;&lt;ref name=jag&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes described as one of the [[rationalism|rationalist]] schools of [[Indian philosophy]], this ancient school's reliance on reason was exclusive but strong.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, pages 43-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana (1995), Ethics in Early Buddhism, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824817022}}, page 8, Quote: The rational argument is identified with the method of '''Samkhya, a rationalist school,''' upholding the view that "nothing comes out of nothing" or that "being cannot be non-being".&lt;/ref&gt;

Samkhya is strongly [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michaels|2004|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sen Gupta|1986|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sāmkhya philosophy regards the universe as consisting of two realities, [[purusha|puruṣa]] ([[consciousness]]) and [[prakṛti]] ([[matter]]). [[Jiva]] (a living being) is that state in which puruṣa is bonded to prakṛti in some form.&lt;ref name=sambri/&gt; This fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of ''buddhi'' ("intellect") and ''ahaṅkāra'' (ego consciousness). The universe is described by this school as one created by purusa-prakṛti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.&lt;ref name=sambri&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520526/Samkhya Samkhya - Hinduism] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; During the state of imbalance, one of more constituents overwhelm the others, creating a form of bondage, particularly of the mind. The end of this imbalance, bondage is called liberation, or [[kaivalya]], by the Samkhya school.&lt;ref name="Gerald James Larson 2011 pages 36-47"&gt;Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, pages 36-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of God or supreme being is not directly asserted, nor considered relevant by the Samkhya philosophers. Sāṃkhya [[teleology|denies]] the [[Four causes#Final cause|final cause]] of [[Ishvara]] (God).{{sfn|Dasgupta|1922|page=258}} While the Samkhya school considers the [[Vedas]] as a reliable source of knowledge, it is an atheistic philosophy according to [[Paul Deussen]] and other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lpfl&gt;Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; A key difference between Samkhya and Yoga schools, state scholars,&lt;ref name=lpfl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, page 39, 41&lt;/ref&gt;  is that Yoga school  accepts a "personal, yet essentially inactive, deity" or "personal god".&lt;ref&gt;Kovoor T. Behanan (2002), Yoga: Its Scientific Basis, Dover, {{ISBN|978-0486417929}}, pages 56-58&lt;/ref&gt; However, Radhanath Phukan, in the introduction to his translation of the ''Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna'' has argued that commentators who see the unmanifested as non-conscious make the mistake of regarding Samkhya as atheistic, though Samkhya is as much as theistic as Yoga is.&lt;ref&gt; Radhanath Phukan, ''Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna'' (Calcutta: Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay, 1960), pp.36-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Samkhya is known for its theory of [[guṇa]]s (qualities, innate tendencies).&lt;ref&gt;Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, pages 154-206&lt;/ref&gt; Guṇa, it states, are of three types: ''sattva'' being goodness, compassion, illumination, and positivity; ''rajas'' being activity, chaos, passion, and impulsivity, potentially good or bad; and ''tamas'' being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destruction, lethargy, negativity. All matter (''prakṛti''), states Samkhya, has these three guṇas, but in different proportions. The interplay of these guṇas defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life.&lt;ref name=jamesg&gt;James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|9780823931798}}, page 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T Bernard (1999), ''Hindu Philosophy'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1373-1}}, pages 74–76&lt;/ref&gt; The Samkhya theory of guṇas was widely discussed, developed and refined by various schools of Indian philosophies. Samkhya's philosophical treatises also influenced the development of various theories of Hindu ethics.&lt;ref name=royper/&gt;

==Etymology==
''Samkhya'' (सांख्य), also referred to as ''Sankhya'', ''Sāṃkhya'', or ''Sāṅkhya'', is a [[Sanskrit grammar|Sanskrit word]] that, depending on the context, means "to reckon, count, enumerate, calculate, deliberate, reason, reasoning by numeric enumeration, relating to number, rational."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html saMkhya] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of ancient Indian philosophies, ''Samkhya'' refers to the philosophical school in Hinduism based on systematic enumeration and rational examination.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, pages 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
The word ''samkhya'' means ''empirical'' or ''relating to numbers''.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Apte|1957|page=1664"&gt;{{harvnb|Apte|1957|page=1664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term had been used in the general sense of ''metaphysical knowledge''  before,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bhattacharyya|1975|pages=419–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in technical usage it refers to the Samkhya school of thought that evolved into a cohesive philosophical system in early centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|pages=4, 38, 288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Samkhya system is called so because "it 'enumerates' twenty five ''Tattvas'' or true principles; and its chief object is to effect the final emancipation of the twenty-fifth Tattva, i.e. the puruṣa or soul."&lt;ref name="harvnb|Apte|1957|page=1664"/&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Amsuman and Kapila.jpg|thumb|King Amsuman and the yogic sage [[Kapila]].]]
Some 19th and 20th century scholars suggested that Samkhya may have non-Vedic origins. Richard Garbe stated in 1898, "The origin of the Sankhya system appears in the proper light only when we understand that in those regions of India which were little influenced by Brahmanism the first attempt had been made to solve the riddles of the world and of our existence merely by means of reason. For the Sankhya philosophy is, in its essence, not only atheistic but also inimical to the Veda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aniruddha's Commentary and the original parts of Vedantin Mahadeva's commentary on the Sankhya Sutras Translated, with an introduction to the age and origin of the Sankhya system|author=Richard Garbe|pages=xx-xxi|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dandekar, similarly wrote in 1968, "The origin of the Sankhya is to be traced to the pre-Vedic non-Aryan thought complex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title='God in Indian Philosophy' in Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute|author=R.N. Dandekar|pages=444|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars disagreed with this view. [[Surendranath Dasgupta]], for example in 1922, stated, Samkhya can be traced to Upanishads such as Katha, Shvetashvatara and Maitrayani, and the "extant Samkhya" is a system that unites the doctrine of permanence of the Upanishads with the doctrine of momentariness of Buddhism and the doctrine of relativism of Jainism.&lt;ref name="Dasgupta1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|title=A History of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC|year=1975|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0412-8|page = 212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Keith in 1925 stated, "Samkhya owes its origin to the Vedic-Upanisadic-epic heritage is quite evident,"&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, pages 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; and "Samkhya is most naturally derived out of the speculations in the Vedas, Brahmanas and the Upanishads."&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston in 1937, analyzed then available Hindu and Buddhist texts for the origins of Samkhya, then wrote "the origin lay in the analysis of the individual undertaken in the [[Brahmanas]] and earliest Upanishads, at first with a view to assuring the efficacy of the sacrificial rites and later in order to discover the meaning of salvation in the religious sense and the methods of attaining it. Here – in [[Kaushitaki Upanishad]] and [[Chandogya Upanishad]] – the germ are to be found (of) two of the main ideas of classical Samkhya."&lt;ref&gt;EH Johnston (1937), Early Samkhya: An Essay on its Historical Development according to the Texts, The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume XV, pages 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandradhar Sharma in 1960 affirmed that Samkhya in the beginning was based on the theistic absolute of Upanishads, but later on under the influence of Jaina and Buddhist thought it rejected theistic monism and was content with spiritualistic pluralism and atheistic realism. This also explains why some of the later Samkhyas, e.g. [[Vijnanabhiksu]] in the sixteenth century, tried to revive the earlier theism in Samkhya.&lt;ref name="Sharma2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chandradhar Sharma|title=A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3gQVd5WogsC|year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0365-7|page = 137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent scholarship offers another perspective. Ruzsa in 2006,{{sfn|Ruzsa|2006}} for example, states, "Sāṅkhya has a very long history. Its roots go deeper than textual traditions allow us to see. The ancient Buddhist Aśvaghoṣa (in his Buddha-Carita) describes [[Alara Kalama|Arāḍa Kālāma]], the teacher of the young Buddha (ca. 420 B.C.E.) as following an archaic form of Sāṅkhya."{{sfn|Ruzsa|2006}}

[[A. K. Warder|Anthony Warder]] in 2009, summarizes that Samkhya and [[Mīmāṃsā]] schools  appear to have been established before Sramana traditions in India (~500 BCE), and he traces Samkhya origins to be Vedic. Samkhya, writes Warder, "has indeed been suggested to be non-Brahmanical and even anti-Vedic in origin, but there is no tangible evidence for that except that it is very different than most Vedic speculation – but that is (itself) quite inconclusive. Speculations in the direction of the Samkhya can be found in the early Upanishads."&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Kennedy Warder (2009), A Course in Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812444}}, pages 63-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikel Burley in 2012, writes Richard Garbe's 19th century view on Samkhya's origin are weak and implausible.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, pages 37-38&lt;/ref&gt; Burley states that India's religio-cultural heritage is complicated, and likely experienced a non-linear development.&lt;ref name=burleyorigins/&gt; Samkhya is not necessarily non-Vedic nor pre-Vedic, nor a "reaction to Brahmanic hegemony", states Burley.&lt;ref name=burleyorigins/&gt; It is most plausibly, in its origins a lineage that grew and evolved from a combination of ascetic traditions and Vedic "''guru'' (teacher) and disciples". Burley suggests the link between Samkhya and Yoga as likely root of this evolutionary origin during the Vedic era of India.&lt;ref name=burleyorigins&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, pages 37-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1938 and 1967, two previously unknown manuscript editions of ''Yuktidipika'' (ca. 600-700 CE) were discovered and published.&lt;ref name=larsonbhatpotter/&gt; ''Yuktidipika'' is an ancient review by an unknown author and has emerged as the most important commentary on ''[[Samkhyakarika]]'' – itself an ancient key text of the Samkhya school.&lt;ref name=larsonyukti/&gt; This commentary, the reconstruction of pre-''Karika'' epistemology, and of ''Samkhya'' emanation text (containing cosmology-ontology) from the earliest Puranas and ''Mokshadharma'', suggest that ''Samkhya'' as a technical philosophical system existed from about the last century BCE through the early centuries of common era. ''Yuktidipika'' suggests that many more ancient scholars contributed to the origins of ''Samkhya'' in ancient India, than were previously known, and that ''Samkhya'' was a polemical philosophical system. However, almost nothing is preserved about the centuries when these ancient ''Samkhya'' scholars lived.&lt;ref name="larsonbhatpotter" /&gt; Larson, Bhattacharya and Potter state that the shift of ''Samkhya'' from speculations to the normative conceptualization hints, but does not conclusively prove, that ''Samkhya'' may be the oldest of the Indian technical philosophical schools (''Nyaya'', ''Vaisheshika'', Budhhist ontology), one that evolved over time and influenced the technical aspects of Buddhism and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name=larsonbhatpotter&gt;GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604411}}, pages 3-11&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars trace the earliest references to ''Samkhya'' ideas (designated as proto-''Samkhya'' environments) to the composition of [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (~800 BCE to ~600 BCE). ''Samkhya'' philosophy proper begins with the pre-''karika-Samkhya'' (ca. 100 BCE - 200 CE).&lt;ref name="larsonyukti"&gt;GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604411}}, pages 14-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founders===
Sage Kapila is traditionally credited as a founder of the Samkhya school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1997|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear in which century of 1st millennium BCE Kapila lived.&lt;ref name=geraldl&gt;Gerald James Larson and Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604411}}, pages 107-109&lt;/ref&gt; Kapila appears in [[Rigveda]], but context suggests that the word means "reddish-brown color". Both Kapila as a "seer" and the term ''Samkhya'' appear in hymns of section 5.2 in [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] (~300 BCE), suggesting Kapila's and Samkhya philosophy's origins may predate it. Numerous other ancient Indian texts mention Kapila; for example, Baudhayana Grhyasutra in chapter IV.16.1 describes a system of rules for ascetic life credited to Kapila, called ''Kapila Sannyasa Vidha''.&lt;ref name=geraldl/&gt; A 6th century CE Chinese translation and other texts consistently state Kapila as an [[Sannyasa|ascetic]] and the founder of the school, mention Asuri as the inheritor of the teaching, and a much later scholar named Pancasikha as the scholar who systematized it and then helped widely disseminate its ideas. Isvarakrsna is identified in these texts as the one who summarized and simplified Samkhya theories of Pancasikha, many centuries later (roughly 4th or 5th century CE), in the form that was then translated into Chinese by Paramartha in the 6th century CE.&lt;ref name=geraldl/&gt;

===Emergence as a distinct philosophy===

The early texts of the Vedic period,&lt;ref&gt;such as Rg Veda 1.164, 10.90 and 10.129; see GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies'', Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604411}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; contain references to elements of Samkhya philosophy. However, the Samkhya ideas had not distilled and congealed into a distinct, complete philosophy.&lt;ref name=larsonyukti/&gt; The early, proto-Samkhya phase was followed by early Upanishads, about 800 to 700 BCE, wherein ascetic spirituality and monastic (''sramana'' and ''yati'') traditions came in vogue in India. It is in this period, state Larson, Bhattacharya and Potter, that ancient scholars combined proto-Samkhya ideas with a systematic methodology of reasoning (epistemology) and began distilling concepts of spiritual knowledge (''vidya, jnana, viveka''), making Samkhya a more emerging, comprehensive philosophy.&lt;ref name=larsonchandogya&gt;GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604411}}, pages 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; These developing ideas are found in texts such as the [[Chandogya Upanishad]].&lt;ref name=larsonchandogya/&gt;

Sometime about the 5th century BCE, Samkhya thought from various sources started coalescing into a distinct, complete philosophy.{{sfn|Burley|2006|pp=15–16}} Philosophical texts such as the [[Katha Upanishad]] in verses 3.10–13 and 6.7–11 describe a well defined concept of puruṣa and other concepts of Samkhya,&lt;ref name=pauldeussen&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 273, 288–289, 298–299&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shvetashvatara Upanishad'' in chapter 6.13 describes Samkhya with Yoga philosophy, and Bhagavad Gita in book 2 provides axiological implications of Samkhya, therewith providing textual evidence of Samkhyan terminology and concepts.&lt;ref name="Burley2"&gt;{{harvnb|Burley|2006|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katha Upanishad conceives the Purusha (cosmic spirit, consciousness) as same as the individual soul ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]], Self).&lt;ref name=pauldeussen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Mokshadharma'' chapter of [[Shanti Parva]] (Book of Peace) in the Mahabharata epic, composed between 400 BCE to 400 CE, explains Samkhya ideas along with other extant philosophies, and then lists numerous scholars in recognition of their philosophical contributions to various Indian traditions, and therein at least three Samkhya scholars can be recognized – Kapila, Asuri and Pancasikha.&lt;ref name=larsonbhatpotter /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade et al (2009), ''Yoga: Immortality and Freedom'', Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691142036}}, pages 392–393&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th chapter of the Buddhist text ''Buddhacarita'' suggests Samkhya philosophical tools of reliable reasoning were well formed by about 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name=larsonbhatpotter /&gt;

Samkhya and [[Yoga]] are mentioned together for first time in chapter 6.13 of the Shvetashvatra Upanishad,&lt;ref name="Burley2"/&gt; as ''samkhya-yoga-adhigamya'' (literally, "to be understood by proper reasoning and spiritual discipline").&lt;ref&gt;GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies'', Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604411}}, pages 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhagavad Gita]] identifies Samkhya with understanding or knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2012|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three gunas are also mentioned in the Gita, though they are not used in the same sense as in classical Samkhya.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2012|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gita integrates Samkhya thought with the devotion ([[bhakti]]) of theistic schools and the impersonal [[Brahman]] of [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref name="King1"&gt;{{harvnb|King|1999|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ruzsa, about 2,000 years ago "Sāṅkhya became the representative philosophy of Hindu thought in Hindu circles",{{sfn|Ruzsa|2006}} influencing all strands of the Hindu tradition and Hindu texts.{{sfn|Ruzsa|2006}}

===Vedic influences===
The ideas that were developed and assimilated into the classical Samkhya text, the ''[[Samkhyakarika|Sāṅkhyakārikā]]'', are visible in earlier Hindu scriptures such as the Vedas, the [[Upanishads]] and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.{{sfn|Burley|2006|pp=15–16}}{{sfn|Larson|1998|p=75}} The earliest mention of [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] is in the ''[[Rigveda]]'', a text that was compiled in the second millennium BCE.,{{sfn|Singh|2008|page=185}} in various chapters.

At a mythical level, dualism is found in the [[Indra]]–[[Vritra]] myth of chapter 1.32 of the Rigveda.{{sfn|Larson|1998|page=79}} Enumeration, the etymological root of the word Samkhya, is found in numerous chapters of the Rigveda, such as 1.164, 10.90 and 10.129.&lt;ref name=lbprigveda&gt;GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604411}}, pages 5-6, 109-110, 180&lt;/ref&gt; Larson, Bhattacharya and Potter state that the likely roots of philosophical premises, spirit-matter dualism, meditative themes and religious cosmology in Samkhya philosophy are in the hymns of 1.164 (Riddle Hymns) and 10.129 (Nasadiya Hymns).&lt;ref name=lbprigveda/&gt; However these hymns present only the outline of ideas, not specific Samkhya theories and these theories developed in a much later period.&lt;ref name=lbprigveda/&gt;

For example, the hymns 1.164.2 - 1.164-3 mention "seven" multiple times, which in the context of other chapters of Rigveda have been interpreted as referring to both seven priests at a ritual and seven constellations in the sky, the entire hymn is a riddle that paints a ritual as well as the sun, moon, earth, three seasons, the transitory nature of living beings, the passage of time and spirit.&lt;ref name=jamison1164/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791435809}}, pages 245-250&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Seven to the one-wheeled chariot yoke the Courser; bearing seven names the single Courser draws it.
Three-naved the wheel is, sound and undecaying, whereon are resting all these worlds of being.
The seven [priests] who on the seven-wheeled car are mounted have horses, seven in tale, who draw them onward.
Seven Sisters utter songs of praise together, in whom the names of the seven Cows are treasured.
Who hath beheld him as he [Sun/Agni] sprang to being, seen how the boneless One [spirit] supports the bony [body]?
Where is the blood of earth, the life, the spirit? Who will approach the one who knows, to ask this?

Two Birds with fair wings, knit with bonds of friendship, embrace the same tree.
One of the twain eats the sweet fig; the other not eating keeps watch.
Where those fine Birds hymn ceaselessly their portion of life eternal, and the sacred synods,
There is the Universe's mighty Keeper, who, wise, hath entered into me the simple.
The tree on which the fine Birds eat the sweetness, where they all rest and procreate their offspring,
Upon its top they say the fig is sweetest, he who does not know the Father will not reach it.

The emphasis of duality between existence (sat) and non-existence (asat) in the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] of the ''Rigveda'' is similar to the vyakta–[[avyakta]] (manifest–unmanifest) polarity in Samkhya. The hymns about Puruṣa may also have influenced Samkhya.{{sfn|Larson|1998|pp=59, 79–81}} The Samkhya notion of buddhi or mahat is similar to the notion of [[hiranyagarbha]], which appears in both the ''Rigveda'' and the ''[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]]''.{{sfn|Larson|1998|p=82}}

The oldest of the [[Mukhya Upanishads|major Upanishads]] (c. 900–600 BCE) contain speculations along the lines of classical Samkhya philosophy.{{sfn|Burley|2006|pp=15–16}} The concept of [[ahamkara]] in Samkhya can be traced back to the notion of ahamkara in chapters 1.2 and 1.4 of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] and chapter 7.25 of the ''[[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]]''.{{sfn|Burley|2006|pp=15–16}} Satkaryavada, the theory of causation in Samkhya, can be traced to the verses in sixth chapter which emphasize the primacy of sat (being) and describe creation from it. The idea that the three gunas or attributes influence creation is found in both Chandogya and [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upanishadic sages [[Yajnavalkya]] and [[Uddalaka Aruni]] developed the idea that pure consciousness was the innermost essence of a human being. The purusha of Samkhya could have evolved from this idea. The enumeration of [[tattva]]s in Samkhya is also found in [[Taittiriya Upanishad]], [[Aitareya Upanishad]] and Yajnavalkya–Maitri dialogue in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|pages=88–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist and Jainist influences===
[[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] had developed in eastern India by the 5th century BCE. It is probable that these schools of thought and the earliest schools of Samkhya influenced each other. A prominent similarity between Buddhism and Samkhya is the greater emphasis on suffering ([[dukkha]]) as the foundation for their respective soteriological theories, than other Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=larson9193/&gt; However, suffering appears central to Samkhya in its later literature, which suggests a likely Buddhism influence. Elaide, however, presents the alternate theory that Samkhya and Buddhism developed their soteriological theories over time, benefitting from their mutual influence.&lt;ref name=larson9193/&gt;

Likewise, the Jain doctrine of plurality of individual souls ([[jiva]]) could have influenced the concept of multiple purushas in Samkhya. However Hermann Jacobi, an Indologist, thinks that there is little reason to assume that Samkhya notion of Purushas was solely dependent on the notion of jiva in Jainism. It is more likely, that Samkhya was moulded by many ancient theories of soul in various Vedic and non-Vedic schools.&lt;ref name=larson9193&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|pages=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larson, Bhattacharya and Potter state it to be likely that early Samkhya doctrines found in oldest Upanishads (~700-800 BCE) provided the contextual foundations and influenced Buddhist and Jaina doctrines, and these became contemporaneous, sibling intellectual movements with Samkhya and other schools of Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604411}}, pages 2-8, 114-116&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidenced, for example, by the references to Samkhya in ancient and medieval era Jaina literature.&lt;ref&gt;GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604411}}, pages 6-7, 74-88, 113-122, 315-318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source material==
===Texts===
The earliest surviving authoritative text on classical Samkhya philosophy is the ''[[Samkhyakarika|Samkhya Karika]]'' (c. 200 CE{{sfn|Bagchi|1989}} or 350–450 CE&lt;ref name="King1"/&gt;) of Īśvarakṛṣṇa.&lt;ref name="King1"/&gt; There were probably other texts in early centuries CE, however none of them are available today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iśvarakṛṣṇa in his ''Kārikā'' describes a succession of the disciples from Kapila, through ''Āsuri and ''Pañcaśikha to himself. The text also refers to an earlier work of Samkhya philosophy called Ṣaṣṭitantra (science of sixty topics) which is now lost.&lt;ref name="King1"/&gt; The text was imported and translated into Chinese about the middle of the 6th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|pages=147–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The records of [[Al Biruni]], the Persian visitor to India in the early 11th century, suggests Samkhyakarika was an established and definitive text in India in his times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Samkhyakarika'' includes distilled statements on epistemology, metaphysics and soteriology of the Samkhya school. For example, the fourth to sixth verses of the text states it epistemic premises,&lt;ref name=henrysamkhya/&gt;

{{Quote|
Perception, inference and right affirmation are admitted to be threefold proof; for they (are by all acknowledged, and) comprise every mode of demonstration. It is from proof that belief of that which is to be proven results.

Perception is ascertainment of particular objects. Inference, which is of three sorts, premises an argument, and deduces that which is argued by it. Right affirmation is true revelation (''Apta vacana'' and ''Sruti'', testimony of reliable source and the Vedas).

Sensible objects become known by perception; but it is by inference or reasoning that acquaintance with things transcending the senses is obtained. A truth which is neither to be directly perceived, nor to be inferred from reasoning, is deduced from ''Apta vacana'' and ''Sruti''.

The most popular commentary on the Samkhyakarika was the Gauḍapāda Bhāṣya attributed to [[Gaudapada|Gauḍapāda]], the proponent of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of philosophy. Richard King, Professor of Religious Studies, thinks it is unlikely that Gauḍapāda could have authored both texts, given the differences between the two philosophies. Other important commentaries on the karika were ''Yuktidīpīka'' (c. 6th century CE) and [[Vachaspati Misra|''Vācaspati''’s]] ''Sāṁkhyatattvakaumudī'' (c. 10th century CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1999|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Samkhyapravachana Sutra|Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra]]'' (c. 14th century CE) renewed interest in Samkhya in the medieval era. It is considered the second most important work of Samkhya after the karika.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliade|Trask|White|2009|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentaries on this text were written by Anirruddha (''Sāṁkhyasūtravṛtti'', c. 15th century CE), Vijñānabhikṣu (''Sāṁkhyapravacanabhāṣya'', c. 16th century CE), Mahādeva (vṛttisāra, c. 17th century CE) and Nāgeśa (''Laghusāṁkhyasūtravṛtti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|1923|pages=253–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Surendranath Dasgupta]], scholar of Indian philosophy, [[Charaka Samhita]], an ancient Indian medical treatise, also contains thoughts from an early Samkhya school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dasgupta|1922|pages=213–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lost textual references===
In his ''Studies in Samkhya Philosophy'', K.C. Bhattacharya writes: {{Quote|Much of Samkhya literature appears to have been lost, and there seems to be no continuity of tradition from ancient times to the age of the commentators...The interpretation of all ancient systems requires a constructive effort; but, while in the case of some systems where we have a large volume of literature and a continuity of tradition, the construction is mainly of the nature of translation of ideas into modern concepts, here in Samkhya the construction at many places involves supplying of missing links from one's imagination. It is risky work, but unless one does it one cannot be said to understand Samkhya as a philosophy. It is a task that one is obliged to undertake. It is a fascinating task because Samkhya is a bold constructive philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Samkhya Philosophy, Volume 1|author=K.C.

=== Epistemology ===
[[File:3 Pramana Epistemology Samkhya Yoga Hindu schools.svg|thumb|The Samkhya school considers perception, inference and reliable testimony as three reliable means to knowledge.&lt;ref name="Lpage9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;]]
Samkhya considered ''Pratyakṣa'' or ''Dṛṣṭam'' (direct sense perception), ''Anumāna'' (inference), and  ''Śabda'' or ''Āptavacana'' (verbal testimony of the sages or shāstras) to be the only valid means of knowledge or ''pramana''.&lt;ref name="Lpage9"&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike some other schools, Samkhya did not consider the following three ''pramanas'' to be epistemically proper: ''Upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy), ''Arthāpatti'' (postulation, deriving from circumstances) or ''Anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) .&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;

*'''''Pratyakṣa''''' (प्रत्यक्ष) means perception. It is of two types in Hindu texts: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind.&lt;ref name=kamal&gt;MM Kamal (1998), The Epistemology of the Carvaka Philosophy, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, 46(2): 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B Matilal (1992), Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198239765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient and medieval Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception:&lt;ref name=kpmat/&gt; ''Indriyarthasannikarsa'' (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), ''Avyapadesya'' (non-verbal; correct perception is not through [[hearsay]], according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), ''Avyabhicara'' (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and ''Vyavasayatmaka'' (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).&lt;ref name=kpmat&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 160-168&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient scholars proposed "unusual perception" as ''pramana'' and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included ''pratibha'' (intuition), ''samanyalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and ''jnanalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 168-169&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some schools  considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from ''Pratyakṣa-pranama'', so as to contrast ''nirnaya'' (definite judgment, conclusion) from ''anadhyavasaya'' (indefinite judgment).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Anumāna''''' (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason.&lt;ref&gt;W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, page 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of ''Anumana''.&lt;ref name=kamal/&gt; In all except one Hindu philosophies,&lt;ref&gt;Carvaka school is the exception&lt;/ref&gt; this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: ''pratijna'' (hypothesis), ''hetu'' (a reason), and ''drshtanta'' (examples).&lt;ref name=jl4647&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Anumana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: ''sadhya'' (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and ''paksha'' (the object on which the ''sadhya'' is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if ''sapaksha'' (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if ''vipaksha'' (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand ''Vyapti'' - the requirement that the ''hetu'' (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in "all" cases, in both ''sapaksha'' and ''vipaksha''.&lt;ref name=jl4647/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a ''nigamana'' (conclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools, such as [[Carvaka]], state that this is never possible, and therefore ''Sabda'' is not a proper ''pramana''. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.&lt;ref&gt;P.

===Dualism===
While [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical traditions]], as exemplified by [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]], equate mind with the conscious self and theorize on consciousness on the basis of mind/body dualism; Samkhya provides an alternate viewpoint, intimately related to [[substance dualism]], by drawing a metaphysical line between consciousness and matter—where matter includes both body and mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haney|2002|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Isaac|Dangwal|1997|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samkhya system espouses [[Consciousness–matter dualism|dualism between consciousness and matter]] by postulating two "irreducible, innate and independent realities: puruṣa and [[prakṛti]]. While the prakṛti is a single entity, the Samkhya admits a plurality of the puruṣas in this world. Unintelligent, unmanifest, uncaused, ever-active, imperceptible and eternal prakṛti is alone the final source of the world of objects which is implicitly and potentially contained in its bosom. The puruṣa is considered as the conscious principle, a passive enjoyer (''bhokta'') and the prakṛti is the enjoyed (''bhogya''). Samkhya believes that the puruṣa cannot be regarded as the source of inanimate world, because an intelligent principle cannot transform itself into the unconscious world. It is a pluralistic spiritualism, atheistic realism and uncompromising dualism.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1997|pages=149–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Puruṣa====
[[Purusha|Puruṣa]] is the transcendental self or pure consciousness. It is absolute, independent, free, imperceptible, unknowable through other agencies, above any experience by mind or senses and beyond any words or explanations. It remains pure, "nonattributive consciousness". Puruṣa is neither produced nor does it produce. It is held that unlike [[Advaita Vedanta]] and like [[Purva-Mīmāṃsā]], Samkhya believes in plurality of the puruṣas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1997|pages=155–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prakṛti====
[[File:Evolution in Samkhya.jpg|thumb|160px|Elements in Samkhya philosophy]]
Prakṛti is the first cause of the manifest material universe—of everything except the puruṣa. Prakṛti accounts for whatever is physical, both mind and matter-cum-energy or force.  Since it is the first principle (''tattva'') of the universe, it is called the ''pradhāna'', but, as it is the unconscious and unintelligent principle, it is also called the ''jaDa''. It is composed of three essential characteristics (''triguna''s). These are:
*[[Sattva]] – poise, fineness, lightness, illumination, and joy;
*[[Rajas]] – dynamism, activity, excitation, and pain;
*[[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamas]] – inertia, coarseness, heaviness, obstruction, and sloth.&lt;ref name="Sharma" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1993|pages=270–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1986|pages=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All physical events are considered to be manifestations of the evolution of ''prakṛti,'' or primal nature (from which all physical bodies are derived). Each sentient being or [[Jiva]] is a fusion of puruṣa and prakṛti, whose soul/puruṣa is limitless and unrestricted by its physical body. ''[[Samsara|Samsāra]]'' or bondage arises when the puruṣa does not have the discriminate knowledge and so is misled as to its own identity, confusing itself with the Ego/ahamkāra, which is actually an attribute of ''prakṛti''. The spirit is liberated when the discriminate knowledge of the difference between conscious puruṣa and unconscious prakṛti is realized by the puruṣa.

The unconscious primordial materiality, prakṛti, contains 23 components including intellect ([[buddhi]],mahat), ego ([[ahamkara]]) and mind ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]); the intellect, mind and ego are all seen as forms of unconscious matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haney|2002|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thought processes and mental events are conscious only to the extent they receive illumination from Purusha. In Samkhya, consciousness is compared to light which illuminates the material configurations or 'shapes' assumed by the mind. So intellect, after receiving cognitive structures form the mind and illumination from pure consciousness, creates thought structures that appear to be conscious.&lt;ref name="Isaac"&gt;{{harvnb|Isaac|Dangwal|1997|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahamkara, the ego or the phenomenal self, appropriates all mental experiences to itself and thus, personalizes the objective activities of mind and intellect by assuming possession of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leaman|2000|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; But consciousness is itself independent of the thought structures it illuminates.&lt;ref name="Isaac" /&gt;

By including mind in the realm of matter, Samkhya avoids one of the most serious pitfalls of Cartesian dualism, the violation of physical conservation laws. Because mind is an evolute of matter, mental events are granted causal efficacy and are therefore able to initiate bodily motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leaman|2000|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution ===
The idea of evolution in Samkhya revolves around the interaction of prakṛti and Purusha. Prakṛti remains unmanifested as long as the three gunas are in equilibrium. This equilibrium of the gunas is disturbed when prakṛti comes into proximity with consciousness or Purusha. The disequilibrium of the gunas triggers an evolution that leads to the manifestation of the world from an unmanifested prakṛti.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metaphor of movement of iron in the proximity of a magnet is used to describe this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cowell|Gough|1882|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evolutes of prakṛti can cause further evolution and are labelled evolvents. For example, intellect while itself created out of prakṛti causes the evolution of ego-sense or ahamkara and is therefore an evolvent. While, other evolutes like the five elements do not cause further evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cowell|Gough|1882|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that an evolvent is defined as a principle which behaves as the material cause for the evolution of another principle. So, in definition, while the five elements are the material cause of all living beings, they cannot be called evolvents because living beings are not separate from the five elements in essence.&lt;ref name="CG223"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowell|Gough|1882|pages=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellect is the first evolute of prakṛti and is called mahat or the great one. It causes the evolution of ego-sense or self-consciousness. Evolution from self-consciousness is affected by the dominance of gunas. So dominance of sattva causes the evolution of the five organs of perception, five organs of action and the mind. Dominance of [[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]] triggers the evolution of five subtle elements– sound, touch, sight, taste, smell from self-consciousness. These five subtle elements are themselves evolvents and cause the creation of the five gross elements space, air, fire, water and earth. Rajas is cause of action in the evolutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cowell|Gough|1882|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purusha is pure consciousness absolute, eternal and subject to no change. It is neither a product of evolution, nor the cause of any evolute.&lt;ref name="CG223"/&gt;

Evolution in Samkhya is thought to be purposeful. The two primary purposes of evolution of prakṛti are the enjoyment and the liberation of Purusha.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 23 evolutes of prakṛti are categorized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberation or mokṣa===
{{Quote box |width=20em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right  |quote=The Supreme Good is mokṣa which consists in the permanent impossibility of the incidence of pain... in the realisation of the Self as Self pure and simple. |salign = right
|source =—Samkhyakarika I.3&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinha|2012|page=App. VI,1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Samkhya school considers [[moksha]] as a natural quest of every soul. The [[Samkhyakarika]] states,

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
As the unconscious milk functions for the sake of nourishment of the calf,
so the Prakriti functions for the sake of moksha of the spirit.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Samkhya karika|Verse 57&lt;ref&gt;Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, page 273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colebrookesktrans&gt;Original Sanskrit: [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_major_works/IshvarakRiShNasAnkyakArikA.pdf Samkhya karika] Compiled and indexed by Ferenc Ruzsa (2015), Sanskrit Documents Archives;&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.kouroo.info/kouroo/transclusions/18/37/1837_SankhyaKarikaHTColebrook.pdf Samkhya karika] by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press, page 169&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Samkhya regards ignorance ([[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidyā]]) as the root cause of suffering and bondage (''[[Samsara]]''). Samkhya states that the way out of this suffering is through knowledge (viveka). Mokṣa (liberation), states Samkhya school, results from knowing the difference between prakṛti (avyakta-vyakta) and puruṣa (jña).&lt;ref name="Lpage9"/&gt;

Puruṣa, the eternal pure consciousness, due to ignorance, identifies itself with products of prakṛti such as intellect (buddhi) and ego (ahamkara). This results in endless transmigration and suffering. However, once the realization arises that puruṣa is distinct from prakṛti, is more than empirical ego, and that puruṣa is deepest conscious self within, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Self]] gains isolation (''kaivalya'') and freedom (''moksha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of Samkhya teach that Mokṣa is attained by one's own development of the higher faculties of discrimination achieved by meditation and other yogic practices. Moksha is described by Samkhya scholars as a state of liberation, where ''Sattva'' [[guna]] predominates.&lt;ref name="Gerald James Larson 2011 pages 36-47"/&gt;

=== Causality ===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
The Samkhya system is based on [[Satkaryavada|Sat-kārya-vāda]] or the theory of causation. According to Satkāryavāda, the effect is pre-existent in the cause. There is only an apparent or illusory change in the makeup of the cause and not a material one, when it becomes effect. Since, effects cannot come from nothing, the original cause or ground of everything is seen as prakṛti.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1998|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, Samkhya system follows the ''prakṛti-Parināma Vāda''. ''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Parināma]]'' denotes that the effect is a real transformation of the cause. The cause under consideration here is prakṛti or more precisely Moola-prakṛti (Primordial Matter). The Samkhya system is therefore an exponent of an evolutionary theory of matter beginning with primordial matter. In evolution, prakṛti is transformed and differentiated into multiplicity of objects. Evolution is followed by dissolution. In dissolution the physical existence, all the worldly objects mingle back into prakṛti, which now remains as the undifferentiated, primordial substance. This is how the cycles of evolution and dissolution follow each other. But this theory is very different from the modern theories of science in the sense that prakṛti evolves for each Jiva separately, giving individual bodies and minds to each and after liberation these elements of prakṛti merges into the Moola prakṛti. Another uniqueness of Sāmkhya is that not only physical entities but even mind, ego and intelligence are regarded as forms of Unconsciousness, quite distinct from pure consciousness.

Samkhya theorizes that prakṛti is the source of the perceived world of becoming. It is pure potentiality that evolves itself successively into twenty four [[tattva]]s or principles. The evolution itself is possible because prakṛti is always in a state of tension among its constituent strands or gunas – Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. In a state of equilibrium of three gunas, when the three together are one, "unmanifest" prakṛti which is unknowable. A guna is an entity that can change, either increase or decrease, therefore, pure consciousness is called nirguna or without any modification.

The evolution obeys [[causality]] relationships, with primal Nature itself being the material cause of all physical creation. The cause and effect theory of Samkhya is called ''Satkārya-vāda'' (theory of existent causes), and holds that nothing can really be created from or destroyed into nothingness – all evolution is simply the transformation of primal Nature from one form to another.

Samkhya [[esoteric cosmology|cosmology]] describes how life emerges in the universe; the relationship between Purusha and prakṛti is crucial to [[Patanjali]]'s yoga system. The strands of Samkhya thought can be traced back to the [[Veda|Vedic]] speculation of creation. It is also frequently mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Yogavasishta]].

== Atheism ==
{{Atheism sidebar}}

Samkhya accepts the notion of higher selves or perfected beings but rejects the notion of God. Classical Samkhya argues against the existence of God on [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] grounds. Samkhya theorists argue that an unchanging God cannot be the source of an ever-changing world and that God was only a necessary metaphysical assumption demanded by circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rajadhyaksha|1959|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sutras of Samkhya have no explicit role for a separate God distinct from the puruṣa. Such a distinct God is inconceivable and self-contradictory and some commentaries speak plainly on this subject.

=== Arguments against Ishvara's existence ===
According to Sinha, the following arguments were given by the Samkhya philosophers against the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God:&lt;ref name="Sinha"/&gt;
* If the existence of [[Karma (Hinduism)|karma]] is assumed, the proposition of God as a moral governor of the universe is unnecessary. For, if God enforces the consequences of actions then he can do so without karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of karma, then karma itself would be the giver of consequences and there would be no need of a God.
* Even if karma is denied, God still cannot be the enforcer of consequences. Because the motives of an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God's motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives are assumed to be egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God's eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Samkhya, is an attribute of prakṛti and cannot be thought to grow in God. The testimony of the [[Vedas]], according to Samkhya, also confirms this notion.
* Despite arguments to the contrary, if God is still assumed to contain unfulfilled desires, this would cause him to suffer pain and other similar human experiences. Such a worldly God would be no better than Samkhya's notion of higher self.
* Furthermore, there is no proof of the existence of God. He is not the object of perception, there exists no general proposition that can prove him by inference and the testimony of the Vedas speak of prakṛti as the origin of the world, not God.
Therefore, Samkhya maintained that the various cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments could not prove God.

===Textual references===
The ''Sankhya-tattva-kaumudi'' commenting on Karika 57 argues that a perfect God can have no need to create a world (for Himself) and if God's motive is kindness (for others), Samkhya questions whether it is reasonable to call into existence beings who while non-existent had no suffering.

The ''{{IAST |Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra}}'' in verse no. 1.92 directly states that existence of "Ishvara (God) is unproved". Hence there is no philosophical place for a creationist God in this system. It is also argued by commentators of this text that the existence of Ishvara cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist.&lt;ref name="Sinha"&gt;{{harvnb|Sinha|2012|pages=xiii-iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These commentaries of Samkhya postulate that a benevolent deity ought to create only happy creatures, not a mixed world like the real world.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} A majority of modern academic scholars are of view that the concept of Ishvara was incorporated into the ''nirishvara'' (atheistic) Samkhya viewpoint only after it became associated with the [[Yoga]], the [[Pasupata]] and the [[Bhagavata]] schools of philosophy. This theistic Samkhya philosophy is described in the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Puranas]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Karmarkar|1962|pages=90–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Advaita Vedanta philosopher [[Adi Shankara]] called ''Samkhya'' as the 'principal opponent' (''pradhana-malla'') of the Vedanta. He criticized the ''Samkhya'' view that the cause of the universe is the unintelligent ''Prakruti'' (''Pradhan''). According to Shankara, the Intelligent Brahman only can be such a cause.&lt;ref name="Sharma2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chandradhar Sharma|title=A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3gQVd5WogsC|year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0365-7|pages = 242-244}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered ''Samkhya'' philosophy as propounded in Samkhyakarika to be inconsistent with the teachings in the Vedas, and considered the dualism in Samkhya to be non-Vedic.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, pages 67-70&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ancient Samkhya philosophers in India claimed Vedic authority for their views.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, page 213&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on other schools ==
=== On Indian philosophies ===
With the publication of previously unknown editions of ''Yuktidipika'' about mid 20th century, scholars&lt;ref name=larsonbhatpotterinfluence/&gt; have suggested what they call as "a tempting hypothesis", but uncertain, that Samkhya tradition may be the oldest of the Indian technical philosophical schools (Nyaya, Vaisheshika).&lt;ref name=larsonbhatpotterinfluence&gt;GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604411}}, pages 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vaisheshika]] atomism, [[Nyaya]] epistemology may all have roots in the early Samkhya school of thought; but these schools likely developed in parallel with an evolving Samkhya tradition, as sibling intellectual movements.&lt;ref name=larsonbhatpotterinfluence/&gt;

=== On Yoga ===
[[File:Siddhasana.svg|thumb|[[Yoga]] is closely related to Samkhya in its philosophical foundations.]]
The Yoga school derives its [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] from Samkhya and adds to it the concept of [[Isvara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2008|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholarly opinion on the actual relationship between Yoga and Samkhya is divided. While [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer]] and [[Georg Feuerstein]] believe that Yoga was a tradition common to many Indian schools and its association with Samkhya was artificially foisted upon it by commentators such as [[Vyasa]]. [[Johannes Bronkhorst]] and Eric Frauwallner think that Yoga never had a philosophical system separate from Samkhya. Bronkhorst further adds that the first mention of Yoga as a separate school of thought is no earlier than [[Adi Shankara|Śankara]]'s (c. 788–820 CE)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Isayeva|1993|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brahmasūtrabhaśya.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2008|pages=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On Tantra ===
The dualistic metaphysics of various [[Tantra|Tantric]] traditions illustrates the strong influence of Samkhya on Tantra. [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] was identical to Samkhya in its philosophical approach, barring the addition of a transcendent theistic reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flood|2006|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knut A. Jacobsen, Professor of Religious Studies, notes the influence of Samkhya on [[Srivaishnavism]]. According to him, this Tantric system borrows the abstract dualism of Samkhya and modifies it into a personified male–female dualism of [[Vishnu]] and [[Sri Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2008|pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dasgupta speculates that the Tantric image of a wild [[Kali]] standing on a slumbering [[Shiva]] was inspired from the Samkhyan conception of prakṛti as a dynamic agent and Purusha as a passive witness. However, Samkhya and Tantra differed in their view on liberation. While Tantra sought to unite the male and female ontological realities, Samkhya held a withdrawal of consciousness from matter as the ultimate goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kripal|1998|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bagchi, the Samkhya Karika (in karika 70) identifies Sāmkhya as a [[Tantra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bagchi|1989|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its philosophy was one of the main influences both on the rise of the [[Tantras]] as a body of literature, as well as Tantra [[sadhana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bagchi|1989|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3704">'''SoFlo Superflat''' describes an art genre started in Miami in the 1990s. It is an urban pop [[art movement]] in South Florida that combines super bright colors and ultra flat images. The subject matters are very diverse. It is an outcrop of the Japanese [[Superflat]] movement, founded by the artist [[Takashi Murakami]].

== Description ==
[[File:Sunshine and moon (Caron Bowman painting).jpg|thumb|Sunshine and Moon Caron Bowman, 40x60, Pastel, Example of SoFlo Superflat art]]
These artists emphasize outlines and flat areas of color. What is important is the feeling of flatness. Many of the artists involved in SoFlo Superflat art believe that the culture in SoFlo is not three-dimensional; therefore, it can be better interpreted in very flat brightly colored two-dimensional images. SoFlo Superflat was born out of the compression of genres which is shown through the pop-inflected work of younger artists. The artists in this genre have very specific styles that can be best described as a consistent pictorial language. Repetition of images and pattern is used create a signature look. For example, Britto's "squiggle lines" and geometric patterns are consistent themes in his work.   Artists whose work is regarded as "SoFlo Superflat" include: [[Romero Britto|Britto]], [http://karonbowman.webs.com/ Caron Bowman], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110616225953/http://www.crematagallery.com/ Raul Cremata], Ceron, Ed King, Jose Alvares. 

This new generation of artist does not think about what is art or what is illustration or what is graffiti. Faced with a level of economic uncertainty, SoFlo Superflat artists create their own version of popular culture to draw attention to the dominance of the media, entertainment and consumption.

{{Sufism|Ideas}}{{Islam}}

Major ideas in '''Sufi metaphysics''' have surrounded the concept of ''weḥdah'' ({{lang|ar|وحدة}}) meaning "unity", or in Arabic {{lang|ar|توحيد}} ''[[tawhid]]''. Two main [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Islamic philosophy|philosophies]] prevail on this  topic. ''waḥdat al-wujūd'' literally means the "Unity of Existence" or "Unity of Being" but better translation would be Monotheism of Existence. Wujud (i.e. existence) here refers to Allah's Wujud - implication is Wahdat/Tawheed Of Wujud Of Allah. On the other hand, ''waḥdat ash-shuhūd'', meaning "Apparentism" or  "Monotheism of Witness", holds that [[God in Islam|God]] and his creation are entirely separate.

Some [[Islamic]] reformers have claimed that the difference between the two philosophies differ only in [[semantics]] and that the entire debate is merely a collection of "verbal controversies" which have come about because of ambiguous [[language]]. However, the concept of the relationship between [[God]] and the [[universe]] is still actively debated both among Sufis and between Sufis and non-Sufi [[Muslim]]s.

== Waḥdat al-Wujūd (Unity of Existence)==
The [[philosophy]] of Wahdat al-Wujud was first ever prevailed by [[Husayn ibn Ali]] in his book Mirat-ul-Arifeen which he wrote in response to the question of his son [[Zayn al-Abidin]] about the explanation of [[Surah]] [[Al-Fatiha]]. In this [[book]], he interpreted the [[ideology]] of  Wahdat al-wujud for the first time in the most comprehensive way.{{citation needed|reason=The existence of this work is disputed first. if this work exists a reliable interpretation must also be mentioned. The text should be written ink the conductive genus and not indicative, because it is not clear.|date=August 2016}} After that, the mystical thinker and theologian [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]] discussed this concept in his book called Tohfa Mursala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.yanabi.com/index.php?/topic/376532-tohfa-mursala-sharif-lectures-by-khawaja-ghulam-qutab-din-faridi-dba/ | title = Tohfa Mursala by Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi | publisher = yanabi.com | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160518214710/http://www.yanabi.com/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F376532-tohfa-mursala-sharif-lectures-by-khawaja-ghulam-qutab-din-faridi-dba%2F | archivedate = 18 May 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Andalusia]]n Sufi saint [[Ibn Sabin]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr|S.H. Nasr]] (2006), ''Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present: Philosophy in the Land of Prophecy'', State University of New York Press, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; is also known to employ this term in his writings. But the [[Sufi]] [[saint]] who is most characterized in discussing the ideology of Sufi metaphysics in deepest details is [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref name="muslimphilosophy1"&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H022 Ibn al-'Arabi, Muhyi al-Din (1164–1240)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He employs the term wujud to refer to God as the Necessary [[Being]]. He also attributes the term to everything other than God, but he insists that wujud does not belong to the things found in the [[cosmos]] in any real sense. Rather, the things borrow wujud from [[God]], much as the [[earth]] borrow light from the [[sun]]. The issue is how wujūd can rightfully be attributed to the things, also called "[[entity|entities]]" (aʿyān). From the perspective of [[tanzih]], [[Ibn Arabi]] declares that wujūd belongs to [[God]] alone, and, in his famous phrase, the things "have never smelt a whiff of wujud." From the point of view of [[tasbih]], he affirms that all things are wujūd's self-disclosure ([[tajalli]]) or self-manifestation (ẓohur). In sum, all things are "He/not He" (howa/lāhowa), which is to say that they are both God and other than God, both wujud and other than wujud.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Imaginal worlds, William Chiittick (1994), pg.53&lt;/ref&gt; In his book Fasus –al-Hikam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ibn Arabi|url=http://www.sufi.ir/books/download/english/ibn-arabi-en/fusus-al-hikam-en.pdf|title=Fasus-al-Hikam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ibn-e-Arabi|url=https://bewley.virtualave.net/fusus.html|title=Fasus-al-Hikam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn-e-Arabi states that " wujūd is the unknowable and inaccessible ground of everything that exists.  God alone is true wujūd, while all things dwell in nonexistence, so also wujūd alone is nondelimited (muṭlaq), while everything else is constrained, confined, and constricted. Wujūd is the absolute, infinite, nondelimited reality of God, while all others remain relative, finite, and delimited".

[[Ibn Arabi]]’s doctrine of wahdat ul wujud focuses on the esoteric ([[Batin (Islam)|batin]]) reality of creatures instead of exoteric ([[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]]) dimension of reality. Therefore he interprets that wujud is one and unique reality from which all reality derives. The external world of sensible objects is but a fleeting shadow of the Real (al- Haq), God . God alone is the all embracing and [[eternity|eternal]] reality. Whatever exists is the shadow([[tajalli]]) of the Real and is not independent of God. This is summed up in [[Ibn Arabi]]’s own words.
" [[Glory (religion)|Glory]] to Him who created all things, being Himself their very [[essence]](ainuha)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/hmp/chp20.doc|title=A History of Muslim Philosophy, pg. 409.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To call wujud or Real Being "one" is to speak of the unity of the Essence. In other terms, it is to say that Being—Light in itself—is nondelimited (mutlaq), that is, [[infinity|infinite]] and [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], undefined and indefinable, indistinct and indistinguishable. In contrast, everything other than Being—every existent thing (mawjûd)—is [[distinction (philosophy)|distinct]], [[defined]], and limited(muqayyad). The Real is incomparable and transcendent, but it discloses itself (tajallî) in all things, so it is also similar and immanent. It possesses such utter nondelimitation that it is not delimited by nondelimitation. "God possesses Nondelimited Being, but no delimitation prevents Him from delimitation. On the contrary, He possesses all delimitations, so He is nondelimited delimitation" &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-arabi/|title= (Ibn ‘Arabî, al-Futûhât}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the highest level, wujūd is the absolute and nondelimited reality of God, the "Necessary Being" (wājib al-wujūd) that cannot not exist. In this sense, wujūd designates the Essence of God or of the Real (dhāt al-ḥaqq), the only reality that is real in every respect. On lower levels, wujūd is the underlying substance of "everything other than God" (māsiwāAllāh)—which is how [[Ibn Arabi]] and others define the "cosmos" or "universe" (al-ʿālam). Hence, in a secondary meaning, the term wujūd is used as shorthand to refer to the whole [[cosmos]], to everything that exists. It can also be employed to refer to the existence of each and every thing that is found in the [[universe]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Imaginal worlds, William Chiittick(1994), pg.15&lt;/ref&gt;

God's 'names' or '[[Property (philosophy)|attributes]]', on the other hand, are the relationships which can be discerned between the [[Essence]] and the [[cosmos]]. They are known to God because he knows every object of knowledge, but they are not existent entities or ontological qualities, for this would imply plurality in the godhead.&lt;ref name="muslimphilosophy1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-arabi/#WahAlWu|title=Names and Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ibn 'Arabî used the term "effusion" (fayd) to denote the act of creation. His writings contain expressions which show different stages of creation, a distinction merely logical and not actual. The following gives details about his vision of creation in three stages: the Most Holy Effusion (al-fayd al-aqdas), the Holy Effusion (al-fayd al-muqaddas) and the Perpetual Effusion (al-fayd al-mustamirr).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articles/unityofbeing.html Souad Hakim – Unity of Being in Ibn 'Arabî&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Waḥdat al-wujūd spread through the teachings of the [[Sufi]]s like Qunyawi, Jandi, Tilimsani, Qayshari, Jami etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present(2006), pg76&lt;/ref&gt;

The noted scholar [[Muhibullah Allahabadi]] strongly supported the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadi|first=Nabi|title=Dictionary of Indo-Persian Literature|page=427 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjJmzdJFOHwC&amp;pg=PA427|accessdate=2014-11-10|year=1995|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-311-3|chapter=MuhhibbullahIlahabadi, Shaikh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sachal Sarmast]] and [[Bulleh Shah]] two Sufi poets from [[India]], were also ardent followers of Waḥdat al-wujūd.
It is also associated with the ''Hamah Ust'' ([[Persian Language|Persian]] meaning "He is the only one") philosophy in South Asia.

==Tashkīk==
Tashkīk or gradation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WwAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=tashkik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAGoVChMIh4-Oo7e3yAIVT81jCh2-sQdU#v=onepage&amp;q=tashkik&amp;f=false|title=tashkik}}&lt;/ref&gt; is closely associated with Sadrian interpretation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H027.html|title=Tashkik al Wujud}}&lt;/ref&gt; of waḥdat al-wujūd. According to this school, the reality and [[existence]] are identical which means existence is one but graded in intensity. This methodology was given a name of tashkik al-wujud and it thus explains that there is gradation of existence that stand in a vast hierarchical chain of being (marāṭib al-wujūd) from floor (farsh) to divine throne (ʿarsh), but the wujūd of each existent ''māhīyya'' is nothing but a grade of the single reality of wujūd whose source is God, the absolute being (al-wujūd al-mutlaq). What differentiates the wujūd of different existents is nothing but wujūd in different degrees of strength and weakness. The universe is nothing but different degrees of strengths and weaknesses of wujūd, ranging from intense degree of wujūd of arch-angelic realities, to the dim wujūd of lowly dust from which Adam was made.&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present, pg 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the concept==
Sufi metaphysics has been a subject to criticism by most non-Sufis; in [[Al-Andalus]], where most of the Muslim scholars were either [[Zahiri]]tes or [[Maliki]]tes preferring the [[Ash'ari]]te [[Islamic theology|creed]], Sufi metaphysics was considered blasphemy and its practitioners blacklisted.&lt;ref name=arabi169&gt;Alexander D. Knysh, ''Ibn Arabi in the Later Islamic Tradition''. Pg. 169. [[State University of New York Press]]: [[Albany, New York|Albany]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of the Ash'arite creed in the east were often suspicious of Sufism as well, most often citing Sufi metaphysics as well.&lt;ref name=arabi169/&gt;

===Criticism from within Sufism===
Some [[Sufi]]s, such as [[Ahmad Sirhindi]], have criticised wahdat-al-wujud. Ahmad Sirhindi wrote about the sayings that universe has no existence of its own and is a shadow of the existence of the necessary being. He also wrote that one should discern the existence of universe from the absolute and that the absolute does not exist because of existence but because of his essence.&lt;ref&gt;MaktoobatRabbaniyah&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism===
[[Pir Meher Ali Shah]] and [[Syed Waheed Ashraf]] have countered that the two concepts differ in that wahdat-al-wujud states that God and the universe aren't identical.&lt;ref&gt;TehqiqulHaq fi KalamatulHaq a book by [[Meher Ali Shah|PirMeher Ali Shah]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Tasawwuf' a book in Urdu by [[Syed Waheed Ashraf]]&lt;/ref&gt; They hold real existence to be for God only and the universe to have no existence on its own.

==Waḥdat asḥ-Shuhūd==
Waḥdat asḥ-Shuhūd (or ''wah-dat-ul-shuhud'', ''wahdat-ul-shuhud,'' or ''wahdatulshuhud'') has often been translated into English as '''Apparentism'''. In Arabic it literally means "unity of witness", "unity of perception", "unity of appearance" or "oneness of manifestation".

Out of those who opposed the doctrine of waḥdat al-wujūd, there were those who substituted the pole of subject for the object, formulating the doctrine of Waḥdat asḥ-Shuhūd. This school was formulated by ʿAlāʾ ad-DawlahSimnānī, was to attract many followers in India, including [[Ahmed Sirhindi]] who provided some of the most widely accepted formulations of this doctrine in the Indian sub-continent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Tasawwuf' book in Urdu by Syed Waheed Ashraf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ahmed Sirhindi's doctrine, any experience of unity between God and the created world is purely subjective and occurs only in the mind of the believer; it has no objective counterpart in the real world. The former position, Shaykh Ahmad felt, led to pantheism, which was contrary to the tenets of Sunni Islam.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} He held that God and creation are not identical; rather, the latter is a shadow or reflection of the Divines Name and Attributes when they are reflected in the mirrors of their opposite non-beings (aʿdām al-mutaqābilah).{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}[[Abu Hafs Umar al-Suhrawardi]] and [[Abd-al-karim Jili]] were also proponents of apparent-ism.

==Al-Wujūd Al-Munbasiṭ (Self-unfolding Being)==
[[Shah Waliullah Dehlawi]] tried to reconcile the two (apparently) contradictory doctrines of waḥdat al-wujūd (unity of being) of [[Ibn Arabi]] and waḥdat ash-shuhūd (unity in conscience) of Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi. Shah Waliullah neatly resolved the conflict, calling these differences 'verbal controversies' which have come about because of ambiguous language. If we leave, he says, all the metaphors and similes used for the expression of ideas aside, the apparently opposite views of the two metaphysicians will agree. The positive result of Shah Wali Allah's reconciliatory efforts was twofold: it brought about harmony between the two opposing groups of meta-physicians, and it also legitimized the doctrine of waḥdat al-wujūd among the mutakallimun (theologians), who previously had not been ready to accept it.

In his books Lamahat and Sata'at, he discusses stages of being, the perceptive faculty, the relation of the abstract with the universe, the universal soul and the souls of man, after death, essence, miracles, the scope of man, the soul of the perfect, universal order, source of manifestation, and the transformation of mystics from quality to quality. He also demonstrated that the long-standing assumption that Sufi doctrine was divided between Apparentism and Unity of Being was a difference of expression alone, the latter doctrine being seen as merely a less-advanced stage of projection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H045 Shah Wali Allah (Qutb al-Din Ahmad al-Rahim) (1703–62)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his opinion this whole universe has also self (nafs) as an individual person has a self, which is called the Universal Soul (an-nafs al-kullīyyah). The multiplicity of the whole universe has originated from it. When [[Ibn Arabi]] says that everything is God, he thereby means the Universal Soul. This Universal Soul, or the Self-unfolding Being (al-wujūd-al-munbasiṭ), subsists by itself. This existence pervades the whole universe, both the substance and the accident, and accepts the form of everything. It is both immanent and transcendental. Beyond this existence (al-wujūd al-munbasiṭ : Universal Soul) towards the original existence (God) none has access to. In other words, man's progress ends with the Universal Soul or the Self-unfolding Being. He cannot move a step further. The Universal Soul and God are so intermingled that the former is often taken for the latter."

As for the question of the relation that this existence (al-wujūd al-munbasiṭ) has with the essence of God itself. This relation is, however, known only in its reality (anniyyah : I-ness); its quality is unknown and can never be known. Thus when [[Ibn Arabi]] says that the realities of the existing things are the names and the attributes of the Universal Soul (Self-unfolding Being) in the stage of knowledge (fīmarṭabat al-ʿilm, in the Divine Consciousness) or when Imam Rabbani asserts that the realities of existing objects are sheer nothingness on which the lights of the names and attributes of the Universal Soul (al-wujūd al-munbasiṭ) are reflected is exactly the same thing. The difference in their language is so little that it needs no consideration.&lt;ref&gt;G. N. Jalbani, ''The Teachings of Shah Waliyullah of Delhi'', pg98&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waḥdat al-Maqṣūd ==
[[Sultan Bahoo]] first introduced the concept of 'waḥdat al-maqṣūd,' the 'intention of Unity' or the 'necessity of unity.' Sultan Bahoo did not sufficiently elaborate on this idea, focusing his interest and attention towards the concept of 'fanāʾ fi-llāh, baqāʾbillāh' ([[Annihilation]] in God, Lasting with God). He was the only [[Sufi]] scholar to establish the concept of lasting forever with [[Allah]] by ceasing, or annihilating one's self in [[Allah]].

== Biography ==

=== Education and employment ===
Gendler was born in 1965 in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] to Mary and [[Everett Gendler]], a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] rabbi. She grew up in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], where she attended the Andover public schools and then [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Academy Andover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Class Notes |magazine=Andover Bulletin |page=91 |url=http://www.alumniconnections.com/olc/pub/PAA/files/Summer08ClassNotes.pdf |format=PDF |date=Summer 2008 |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an undergraduate, she studied at [[Yale University]], where she was a championship debater in the [[American Parliamentary Debate Association]] and a member of [[Manuscript Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yaledebate.org/reunion/schedule.php |title=YDA Alumni Reunion |publisher=Yaledebate.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-27 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328125842/http://www.yaledebate.org/reunion/schedule.php |archivedate=March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated ''summa cum laude'' in 1987 with Distinction in Humanities and Math &amp; Philosophy.

After graduating from college, she worked for several years as an assistant to [[Linda Darling-Hammond]] at the RAND Corporation’s education policy division in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/authors/g/gendler_tamar.html |title=Reports &amp; Bookstore &amp;#124; Authors &amp;#124; G &amp;#124; Tamar Gendler |publisher=RAND |date= |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, she earned her philosophy [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at Harvard University, with [[Robert Nozick]], [[Derek Parfit]] and [[Hilary Putnam]] as her advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pantheon.yale.edu/~tgendler/TamarGendlerAbout.htm |title=Tamar Gendler About |publisher=Pantheon.yale.edu |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gendler taught philosophy at [[Yale University]] (1996–97), [[Syracuse University]] (1997–2003) and [[Cornell University]] (2003–06), before returning to Yale in 2006 as Professor of Philosophy and Chair of the Yale University [[Cognitive Science]] Program (2006–2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Marsden |first=Jessica |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/03/02/philosophy-takes-steps-to-rebuild/ |title=Philosophy takes steps to rebuild |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=2 March 2006 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2010, she became Chair of the Yale University Department of Philosophy, becoming the first woman to hold that position in the department’s history and the first female graduate of [[Yale College]] to chair a Yale Department. She held the position until 2013, when she was appointed as Deputy Provost for Humanities and Initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Office of the Provost |title=Gendler appointed deputy provost for the humanities and initiatives |publisher=Yale University |url=http://provost.yale.edu/news/gendler-appointed-deputy-provost-humanities-and-initiatives |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Plan''' is a [[conspiracy theory]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] that since the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act]] in 1973, [[White Americans|white]]  people have had a "plan to take back" the [[African Americans|black]]-majority city and the offices of the [[local government]].&lt;ref name = "JafExam"&gt;Harry Jaffe, [http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/local/So-called-_plan_-for-white-supremacy-lives-on-in-D_C_-656094-101833798.html So-called "plan" for white supremacy lives on in D.C.], ''Washington Examiner'', August 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey R. Henig and Wilbur C. Rich, ''Mayors in the middle: politics, race, and mayoral control of urban schools. Princeton University Press, 2004, pp. 204–207.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory asserts that the decline of low-income black residents and their replacement by wealthier whites from outside of Washington, D.C. is intentional through the calculated use of [[gentrification]] and [[urban renewal]].&lt;ref&gt;https://skeptoid.com/blog/2013/07/29/the-plan-to-retake-washington/&lt;/ref&gt; The Plan is generally regarded as false within Washington, D.C., while some believe it has quiet but considerable support among black residents and influences local [[election]]s.&lt;ref name = "WCPBarras"&gt;Jonetta Rose Barras, [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/39647/michelle-rhees-campaign-to-diversify-dc-public-schools-means-wooing/full Recruiting Diversity: Michelle Rhee's campaign to diversify DCPS means wooing white parents]. ''Washington CityPaper'', August 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It appears that Lillian Wiggins, a columnist for the ''[[Washington Afro American]]'' newspaper, was the first to "articulate" the conspiracy theory.  In 1979, she wrote: "Many residents believe that the [[Marion Barry]] era may be the last time Washington will have a black mayor. If negative programming and characterization of black leadership are allowed to continue in the city of Washington and especially the black community, there is a strong possibility of the 'master plan' which I have so often spoken about maturing in the 1980s."  Believers note that the [[Federal City Council]], an organized group of civic and corporate leaders, mostly white, meets in secret and uses its power to influence the city's direction.&lt;ref name = "JafExam" /&gt;

Anti-theorists note that instead of an organized conspiracy, there are market forces, demographics, and [[gentrification]]—which is happening quickly in the [[District of Columbia]]—at work.  Black residents have left the District, just as many whites moved to the suburbs beginning in the 1950s. Both groups left a decaying city, its crime, and its failing schools seeking "a better, safer life. . . . One could argue that middle-class blacks abandoned the city. Was that part of 'the plan'?"&lt;ref name = "JafExam" /&gt;  Others counter that the existence of the theory reflects "the fears of a black community that already feels under attack in a city whose rising cost of living makes hanging on difficult . . . . if such paranoia seems laughable, it reflects a reality that's easily illustrated in bright colors",&lt;ref&gt;Rend Smith, [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/ Pretty Map Answers Ugly Question], ''Washington CityPaper'', Sep. 21, 2010, 6:06 pm.&lt;/ref&gt; although the theory has been around longer than the city's changing demographics.

==Recent developments==
Census figures show that between 2000 and 2010, the District lost about 39,000 black residents while over 50,000 whites moved in. The black population declined by 11.1%, while the white population saw a 31.4% increase.&lt;ref name = "2010census"&gt;U.S. Census, [http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/embedstate.html?state= "DC"] 2010 Census Results: District of Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Carol Morello and Dan Keating, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/black-dc-residents-plummet-barely-a-majority/2011/03/24/ABtIgJQB_story.html Number of black D.C. residents plummets as majority status slips away], ''The Washington Post'', March 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  "The District, once 'Chocolate City', is becoming, as the saying goes, 'Vanilla Village'."&lt;ref name = "WCPBarras" /&gt; Currently, the city is about 51% black and 39% white&lt;ref name = "2010census" /&gt;—compared to 61%–34% in 2000. The black population peaked in 1970 at 71%.  If trends continue, the city would get a white majority any time from 2014 to 2020.&lt;ref name = "WCPNedow"&gt;Erika Niedowski, [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2010/01/07/d-c-is-continuing-to-whiten/ D.C. Is Continuing to Whiten], ''WashingtonCityPaper'', Jan. 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been attributed to The Plan.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Comrade Al Gonzales, Comment #10 to [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2010/01/07/d-c-is-continuing-to-whiten/ D.C. Is Continuing to Whiten], January 8, 2010, at 4:05 pm.  Accessed 2010.09.23: "'The Plan' is working. White people are pushing black people out of the District - that's 'The Plan'".&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the black population of Washington D.C. dropped below 50% to 49.5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/11000.html US Census: "State &amp; County QuickFacts - District of Columbia"] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/619qO8Tb4?url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/11000.html |date=2011-08-23 }} retrieved January 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to improve the [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] have been linked to the purported conspiracy, as the improvements have tended to increase enrollment of white children.  Although shifting demographics are broadening school demand, these are seen as either the effectuation or the result of The Plan.&lt;ref name = "WCPBarras" /&gt;  Similarly, rising real estate values, increased business, more abundant night life and other factors which "would otherwise be viewed as a positive becomes evidence" of the scheme, even to those who benefit from the improvements.&lt;ref&gt;William Raspberry, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/dc/dc6898/future.htm Toward 2028]" ''The Washington Post'', February 1, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  One commentator opined "Don't ask [Mayor] Fenty or [Schools Chancellor] [[Michelle Rhee|Rhee]] whom this world-class school system will serve if low-income black residents are being evicted from his world-class city in droves" and went on to claim "The scheme was odious: re-create a more sophisticated version of the plantation-style, federally appointed three-member commission that ruled the city for more than a century until 1967."&lt;ref name = "Milloy" &gt;Courtland Milloy, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/15/AR2010091506240.html D.C. election didn't just unseat abrasive Mayor Fenty. It was a populist revolt.]" ''The Washington Post'', September 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plan, and related fears, are said to have contributed to the defeat of incumbent mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] in the [[Washington, D.C. mayoral election, 2010|2010 primary election]].&lt;ref name = "JafExam" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "WCPEdit" &gt;Editorial, [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/39709/2010-endorsements/ Adrian Fenty: The Jerk D.C.

Council chairman imply, stops The Plan dead, putting all those whiny newcomers in their place."&lt;ref name = "WCPEdit" /&gt;

'''''The Rules of Sociological Method''''' ({{lang-fr|Les Règles de la Méthode Sociologique}}) is a book by [[Émile Durkheim]], first published in 1895. It is recognized as being the direct result of Durkheim's own project of establishing [[sociology]] as a [[positivist]] [[social science]].&lt;ref name="Popolo2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kate Reed|title=New Directions in Social Theory: Race, Gender and the Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VY_GOuxcL4AC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=17 March 2011|year=2006|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-0-7619-4270-2|pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim is seen as one of the fathers of sociology,&lt;ref name="BerkmanKawachi2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lisa F.

Durkheim suggests two central theses, without which sociology would not be a science:

# It must have a specific object of study. Unlike [[philosophy]] or [[psychology]], sociology's proper object of study are social facts.
# It must respect and apply a recognized [[objectivity (science)|objective]] [[scientific method]], bringing it as close as possible to the other [[exact science]]s. This method must at all cost avoid [[prejudice]] and [[subjectivism|subjective]] judgment.&lt;ref name="Leavy2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Patricia Leavy]]|title=Method Meets Art: Arts-based Research Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7H6SejkvuEC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=30 July 2008|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-259-7|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This book was one of the defining books for the new science of [[sociology]].&lt;ref name="Noreck"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferreol &amp; Noreck|title=Introduction to Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbo0uvmAqzkC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=17 March 2011|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-3940-8|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim's argument that social sciences should be approached with the same rigorous [[scientific method]] as used in [[natural sciences]] was seen as revolutionary for the time.&lt;ref name="Noreck"/&gt;

''The Rules'' is seen as an important text in sociology and is a popular book on [[sociological theory]] courses. The book's meaning is still being debated by sociologists.&lt;ref name="Pickering2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. S. F.

==Sociology as the study of social facts==
Durkheim's concern is to establish sociology as a science.&lt;ref name="Popolo2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Damian Popolo|title=A New Science of International Relations: Modernity, Complexity and the Kosovo Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMALg_p5zHsC&amp;pg=PA97|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=16 January 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-1226-7|pages=97–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing for a place for sociology among other sciences, he wrote, "Sociology is, then, not an auxiliary of any other science; it is itself a distinct and autonomous science."&lt;ref name="BrintonNee2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary C. Brinton|author2=Victor Nee|title=The New Institutionalism in Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71e_jsQpzg0C&amp;pg=PR11|accessdate=17 March 2011|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4276-4|pages=11–}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give sociology a place in the academic world and to ensure that it is a legitimate science, it must have an object that is clear and distinct from philosophy or psychology. He argued, "There is in every society a certain group of phenomena which may be differentiated from those studied by the other natural sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scott Appelrouth|author2=Laura Desfor Edles|title=Classical and Contemporary Sociological Theory: Text and Readings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUQT47IqVdgC&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=26 September 2007|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=978-0-7619-2793-8|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to social facts, Durkheim defined them as follows:
{{quote|A social fact is every way of acting, fixed or not, capable of exercising on the individual an external constraint; or again, every way of acting which is general throughout a given society, while at the same time existing in its own right independent of its individual manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scott Appelrouth|author2=Laura Desfor Edles|title=Classical and Contemporary sociological Theory: Text and Readings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUQT47IqVdgC&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=26 September 2007|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=978-0-7619-2793-8|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the book's challenges is in showing how individual and seemingly chaotic decisions are in fact a result of a larger, more structured system, the pattern being held together by "social facts".&lt;ref name="BerkmanKawachi2000"/&gt;

The definition of social facts illustrates the [[holistic]] paradigm in which Durkheim's social facts are defined by two main features: they are external to and coercive to individuals.&lt;ref name="Reed2006"/&gt; They not only represent behaviour but also the rules that govern behaviour and give it meaning.&lt;ref name="Collin2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Finn Collin|title=Social Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaHXD5g8EAoC&amp;pg=PA217|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=1 January 2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-04792-7|pages=217–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social facts have been not only accepted by, but have been adopted by society as rules to which they choose to follow.&lt;ref name="Durkheim1982" /&gt; Law, language, morality and marriage are all examples of ideals formed through individual thought that have manifested into these concrete institutions which we must now abide by.&lt;ref name="Preston1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Wallace Preston|title=Development Theory: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_B1_qN8W-9AC&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=17 March 2011|year=1996|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-19555-9|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social facts can be constraining: if individuals do not do act as they dictate, they may face social penalties.&lt;ref name="Preston1996"/&gt; The binding nature of social facts is often implicit, because the rules of society are internalized by individuals in the process of education and socialization.&lt;ref name="Preston1996"/&gt;

Durkheim distinguished two types of social facts: normal social facts – which, within a society, occur regularly and most often – and pathological social facts – which are much less common.

==Principles of sociology==
According to Durkheim, sociologists, without preconceptions and prejudices, must study social facts as real, objective phenomena.&lt;ref name="Durkheim1982"/&gt; Durkheim wrote, "The first and most fundamental rule is: Consider social facts as things."&lt;ref name="Hollis1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Hollis|title=The Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JcsHEm9CLgC&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=17 March 2011|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44780-5|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that sociology must respect and apply a recognized objective, scientific method, bringing it as close as possible to the other exact sciences.&lt;ref name="Durkheim1982"/&gt; This method must at all cost avoid prejudice and subjective judgment.&lt;ref name="Durkheim1982"/&gt;

Furthermore Durkheim talks about social phenomena and how they must be studied. Durkheim wrote: 
{{quote|Social phenomena must be considered in themselves, detached from the conscious beings who form their own mental representations of them. They must be studied from the outside, as external things, because it is in this guise that they present themselves to us&lt;ref&gt;''The Rules of Sociological Method''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3028">'''William Calvert Kneale''' (22 June 1906 &amp;ndash; 24 June 1990) was an [[England|English]] [[logician]] best known for his 1962 book ''The Development of Logic'', a history of logic from its beginnings in [[Ancient Greece]] written with his wife [[Martha Kneale|Martha]].  Kneale was also known as a [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] and the author of a book on [[probability]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]].  Educated at the Liverpool Institute High School for boys, he later became a fellow of [[Exeter College, Oxford]], and in 1960 succeeded to the [[White's Professor of Moral Philosophy]] previously occupied by the linguistic philosopher [[J. L. Austin]]. He retired in 1966.

== Life and work ==

Kneale's interest in the [[history of logic]] began in the 1940s.  The focus of much of Kneale's early work was the legacy of the work of the 19th century logician [[George Boole]].  His first major publication in the history of logic was his paper "Boole and the Revival of Logic," published in the philosophy journal [[Mind_(journal)| Mind]] in 1948.   He was also the author of a number of papers in [[Philosophical logic]], particularly on the nature of [[truth]] for [[natural language]]s, and the role that linguistic concepts play in the treatment of logical [[paradoxes]].

Kneale worked on his great history of logic from 1947 to 1957 together with his wife Martha (who was responsible for the chapters on the ancient Greeks). The result was the 800-page ''The Development of Logic'', first published in 1962, which went through five impressions before going into a second, paperback, edition in 1984.

The 'History' is commonly referred to in the academic world simply as "Kneale and Kneale". It was the only major history of logic available in English in the mid-twentieth century, and the first major history of logic in English since ''The Development of Symbolic Logic'' published in 1906 by [[A.T. Shearman]].  The treatise has been a standard work in the history of logic for decades.

In 1938 he married [[Martha Kneale|Martha Hurst]]; they had two children, George (born 1942) and [[Jane Heal|Jane (married name Heal)]]; born 1946).

'''Wolfgang Stegmüller''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃteːgˌmʏlɐ|lang}}; June 3, 1923 – June 11, 1991), was a German-Austrian philosopher with important contributions in [[philosophy of science]] and in [[analytic philosophy]].

==Biography==
W. Stegmüller studied [[economics]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Innsbruck]]. In 1944 he graduated as "Diplom-Volkswirt" and one year later he obtained a PhD in economics. Also at the University of Innsbruck he obtained in 1947 a PhD in philosophy. In 1949 he [[Habilitation|habilitated]] with the thesis "Sein, Wahrheit und Wert in der heutigen Philosophie".

After a stay of one year at the University of Oxford in 1954 he returned to the University of Innsbruck where he was appointed as associate professor for philosophy in 1956. After stays as visiting professor at the Universities of Kiel and Bonn he received a call from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Here in 1958 he was appointed professor for philosophy, logic, and philosophy of sciences and became director of the "Seminar II". Except for two stays at as a visiting professor in 1962/63 and 1964 at the University of Pennsylvania he remained in Munich and ran there a center for [[analytical philosophy]] until his retirement in 1990. From 1977 to 1979 he also was dean of the faculty for philosophy, philosophy of science, and statistics.

Stegmüller was from 1966 on a corresponding member of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] and from 1967 on a member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. 1972 he became a member of the French [[Institut International de Philosophie]], located in Paris. He also was a member of the [[International Academy of Science, Munich]] founded in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias-icsd.org/resources/ICSD-IAS-Founding-Members-1989.pdf Selection of IAS-ICSD Founding Members]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 W. Stegmüller was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Innsbruck. After his retirement he was elected as honorary president of the [[Gesellschaft für Analytische Philosophie]] (Society for Analytical Philosophy).

==Work==
Stegmüller can be credited with essential contributions to the dissemination of ideas of [[analytical philosophy]] and [[philosophy of science]] in the [[German language|German]]-speaking world. In his [[inaugural lecture]] at the [[University of Innsbruck]], he outlined the four problems in [[epistemology]], which he focussed on in his later work:

* The problem of [[inductive reasoning|induction]]
* The fundamental role of [[experience]]
* The problem of [[theoretical concept]]s
* The problem of [[scientific explanation]]

===Logic===
In his books "Das Wahrheitsproblem und die Idee der Semantik" (''The Problem of Truth and the idea of Semantics'', 1957), and "Unvollständigkeit und Unentscheidbarkeit" (''Incompleteness and Undecidability'', 1959) Stegmüller disseminated the ideas of [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] on [[semantics]] and [[logics]] as well as those of [[Kurt Gödel]] on [[mathematical logic]]. Later similar works are on "Die Antinomien und ihre Behandlung" (''[[antimony|Antinomies]] and Their Treatment'', 1955) as well as "Strukturtypen der Logik" (''Types of Structures of Logic'', 1961).

===Epistemology===
One of the most influential books of Stegmüller is  "Metaphysik, Skepsis, Wissenschaft" (1954). In this work, he discusses the epistemological foundations of [[metaphysics]], [[scepticism]], and [[science]]. He demonstrates that any search for epistemological fundamentals will necessarily lead to the problem of the [[evidence]] — which Stegmüller does not regard as solvable. He also refuses the potential solution that universal [[skepticism]] is [[self-refuting idea|self-refuting]]. Even if it was self-refuting, universal skepticism can be stated if the skeptic does not try to justify it. In consequence, explicit conditions (''Evidenzvoraussetzungen'') are necessary in [[metaphysics]] as well as in [[science]]. This means that neither can be fundamentally justified but do presuppose a decision.

A further focus of Stegmüller's work was [[phenomenalism]]. In "Der Phänomenalismus und seine Schwierigkeiten" (1958), he describes the extreme problems, which hinder a stringent implementation of the phenomentalist program.

===Philosophy of science===
Stegmüller is regarded as one of the leading philosophers of science of the second half of the 20th century. Deeply influenced by [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] and [[Joseph D. Sneed]], he and several co-workers expanded upon the ideas of Sneed in order to overcome the prevalent rationality crisis of the science that was often regarded as a consequence of Kuhn's works. Furthermore, this led him to a new answer to the problems of [[theoretical concept]]s. This line of investigations is today known as the ""[[structuralism (philosophy of science)|structural theory of the empirical sciences]]".

'''Isaac Woodbridge Riley''' (May 20, 1869 - September 2, 1933)&lt;ref&gt;Shook, John R. (2005). ''Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers. Volume 1''. Thoemmes Continuum. p. 2053. {{ISBN|1-84371-037-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American academic scholar who worked in and across the areas of [[Philosophy]], [[Religion]], and [[Psychology]]. His published work often combined two of these disciplines in considering the historical development of a social movement or entity (such as a 'church'), particularly examining the influence of the founders' psychological character. His books concerning the foundation and moral standing of [[Mormonism]] and [[Christian Science]] made him a focus of controversy. Most of his career was spent as a professor of Philosophy at [[Vassar College]].

==Biography==

Riley was born in [[New York City]]. He graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1892, and took the degrees of [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] there in 1898 and 1902 respectively.&lt;ref name="Vassar Encyclopedia"&gt;[http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/faculty/prominent-faculty/woodbridge-riley.html "Woodbridge Riley"]. Retrieved 10 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He cited the noted and decorated Philosopher, Psychologist, and Congregational minister [[George Trumbull Ladd]] (Clarke Professor of Metaphysics and Moral Philosophy at Yale University) as his first Philosophy teacher. From 1903, Riley was associate editor of the ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''.&lt;ref name="Vassar Encyclopedia"/&gt; He was Johnston research scholar at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1904–07, during which period he was already "for some time" a professor at the [[University of New Brunswick]]. In 1908, Riley became professor of philosophy at Vassar, and by 1920 was simultaneously a Lecturer at the [[Sorbonne]].

Riley's Ph.D. thesis at Yale was ''The Founder of Mormonism: A Psychological Study of Joseph Smith'', published in 1902.&lt;ref name="Vassar Encyclopedia"/&gt; It was positively reviewed in psychology journals.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1903). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-13152-001 ''Review of The Founder of Mormonism: A Psychological Study of Joseph Smith, Jr.]'' ''[[Psychological Review]]'' 10 (1): 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Riley suspected that [[Joseph Smith]] acquired his [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] from epileptic seizures. He wrote that the "psychiatric definition of the epileptic fits the prophet to a dot."&lt;ref&gt;Aron, Paul. (2006). ''Mysteries in History: From Prehistory to the Present''. ABC-CLIO. p. 248. {{ISBN|1-85109-899-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He associated Smith's dictation of the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' with the phenomenon of [[automatic writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Vogel|Vogel, Dan]]. (2004). ''[[Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet]]''. Signature Books. p. 10. {{ISBN|978-1-56085-179-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Christian Science==

He is known for his book ''The Faith, the Falsity and the Failure of Christian Science'' (1925), co-authored with physician Charles Edward Humiston and lawyer Frederick William Peabody. The book argues that [[Christian Science]] has no scientific legitimacy, it also records many cases of death caused by its practitioners due to lack of medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenel, M. P. (1926). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1321066/?page=1 ''The Faith, the Falsity and the Failure of Christian Science'']. ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'' 16 (2): 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riley argued that [[Mary Baker Eddy]] plagiarized her ideas from [[Franz Mesmer]], [[Phineas Quimby]] and the [[Shakers]].&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1925). [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/237520 ''The Faith, The Falsity and The Failure of Christian Science'']. ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' 85 (12): 924.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9748">'''Yalçın Küçük''' (born 1938) is a Turkish socialist writer, philosopher, economist, historian and [[media pundit]], recognized for his historical studies on the late-Ottoman and Republican periods in the history of Turkey and Soviet economic development from a Marxist perspective and also his interest in [[crypto-Judaism]] in Turkey ([[Sabbateanism]]) and criticism of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]].&lt;ref name=yon/&gt;&lt;ref name=kimdir&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/10720612.asp|accessdate=2009-01-07|title=Prof. Dr. Yalçın Küçük kimdir|work=[[Hürriyet]]
|date=2009-01-07|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was detained for 682 days in relation to the [[Odatv case]] of the [[Ergenekon trials]] (released in December 2012).&lt;ref name=HDN/&gt; In August 2013 he was sentenced to 22 years and six months, later to be released on 12/12/13.&lt;ref&gt;[[Today's Zaman]], 5 August 2013, [http://todayszaman.com/news-322781-long-sentences-for-ergenekon-suspects-life-for-ex-army-chief.html Long sentences for Ergenekon suspects, life for ex-army chief]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Küçük was born in [[Iskenderun]]. His father's ancestry is [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkoman]] while his mother's is [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]]&lt;!-- this is mentioned because the man himself is fixated on these matters --&gt;. He went to the [[Kabataş High School]], followed by [[Ankara University]]. He graduated in 1960 with a degree in [[political science]].&lt;ref name=kimdir/&gt;

==Career==
His first job was in the State Planning Board, where he eventually oversaw the Long Term Planning department. In 1966 he found a position at the [[Middle East Technical University]]. He was fired after the [[1971 Turkish coup d'état|1971 coup]].
Before the coup he wrote calling for a "Socialist Revolution" and a socialist administration in Turkey in the leftist publications ''Yön'', ''Emek'', ''[[Ant (newspaper)|Ant]]''.&lt;ref name=yon/&gt; He is also well known for his bitter criticisms of another strategy called "National Democratic Revolution" ({{lang-tr|Milli Demokratik Devrim}}).

&lt;!-- needs to be confirmed: Towards the end of the decade he did a two year stint at [[Birmingham University]]'s Russian and Eastern European Research Center. In a period of intense political tension, Küçük's interest in [[Sovietology]] landed him with an eight year prison sentence. --&gt;
In 1973, he became a reserve officer at the Polatlı Artillery school (military service is compulsory in Turkey). Afterward he ran the economy department of the establishment newspaper, ''[[Cumhuriyet]]''.&lt;ref name=kimdir/&gt; He also ran the economy bulletin of the [[Anka news agency]].&lt;ref name=yon/&gt;

He soon devoted himself to leftist causes, such as editing the newspaper ''Yürüyüş'' and relaunching of the [[Workers Party of Turkey]] ({{lang-tr|Türkiye İşçi Partisi}}). The party kicked him and some others out in 1978; so, they launched a magazine called ''Socialist Power'' ({{lang-tr|Sosyalist İktidar}}) the next year.&lt;ref name=yon/&gt;

In 1979 he joined [[Ankara University]] but was again dismissed after [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|the next coup]], in 1980. He returned to academia at [[Gazi University]], and retired in 1987.&lt;ref name=yon/&gt;

==Retirement==
In his retirement he continued to write for ''Social Deliverance'' ({{lang-tr|Toplumsal Kurtuluş}}) and ''Always Forward'' ({{lang-tr|Hep İleri}}). In 1993 he interviewed the leader of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]], [[Abdullah Öcalan]] in Syria's [[Bekaa Valley]]. Numerous photographs were leaked depicting Öcalan providing Küçük with a tour of the camp, and dining with him.&lt;ref name=yon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kackartv.com.tr/Default.asp?I=Haber&amp;ID=15351|accessdate=2008-11-23
|title=İşte Yalçın Küçük'ün Kankası|work=Rize Kaçkar Televizyonu|language=Turkish|date=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Küçük's photographs with Abdullah Öcalan were in fact published in his own books and journals edited by Küçük himself in the 1990s during his contact with PKK.&lt;ref&gt;For instance see various issues of ''Toplumsal Kurtuluş'' and ''Bilim ve Edebiyat''&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted on various TV channels and in interviews that these photographs were neither secret nor a cause for shame. As a social scientist and a socialist he analyzed what he claimed was the most powerful insurgency against the Turkish state. Kurdish political organizations other than the PKK claimed that Küçük "Kemalized" Öcalan by persuading him to turn his back on separatism.

He left for [[Paris]] in 1993 as a protest against president [[Süleyman Demirel]] and the fact that a brothel owner, [[Matild Manukyan]], was the highest taxpayer, but returned after the [[28 February operation|1997 "post-modern" coup]]. However, he was sentenced to two years in prison for spreading separatist propaganda (his interviews with Öcalan). He briefly had a show on [[Sky Türk]] called ''Pens and Swords'' ({{lang-tr|Kalemler ve Kılıçlar}}) but it got pulled allegedly after complaints from the government and the former chief of general staff, [[Yaşar Büyükanıt]].&lt;ref name=yon/&gt;

His houses in [[Karakusunlar]], [[Ankara]] and &lt;!-- Tahtaminare Mahallesi Fener Kireçhane Sokağı --&gt;[[Balat (Istanbul)|Balat]], [[Istanbul]] were searched in January 2009 in the context of the ongoing [[Ergenekon investigation]]. His lawyer, Dursun Ermiş, arrived at Küçük's home in Ankara to field journalists' questions. The search warrant was issued by the Ninth Heavy Penal Court in İstanbul. The police were searching for documents pertaining to the Ergenekon network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/10720408.asp|accessdate=2009-01-07|title=Yalçın Küçük'ün evinde arama|work=[[Hürriyet]]|date=2009-01-07|first=Nurettin|last=Kurt|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later detained for 682 days in relation to the [[Odatv case]] of the [[Ergenekon trials]] (released in December 2012), and remains under indictment.&lt;ref name=HDN&gt;[[Hurriyet Daily News]], 28 December 2012, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/chp-leader-pleased-at-journalist-yalcins-release.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=37856&amp;NewsCatID=338 CHP leader pleased at journalist Yalçın’s release]&lt;/ref&gt;
