In the [[music industry]], a '''360 deal''' (from '''360° deal''') is a business relationship between an artist and a music industry company. The company agrees to provide financial and other support for the artist, including direct advances as well as support in marketing, promotion, touring and other areas. In turn, the artist agrees to give the company a percentage of an increased number of their revenue streams, often including sales of recorded music, live performances, publishing and more. 

This business arrangement is an alternative to the traditional recording contract. In a 360 deal, a company typically provides support to an artist in more areas than covered by a traditional recording contract on the condition of receiving a percentage of revenue from these additional areas. During the first decade of the 21st century, revenues from recorded music fell dramatically and the profit margins traditionally associated with the record industry disappeared. The 360 deal reflects the fact that much of a musician's income now comes from sources other than recorded music, such as live performance and merchandise.

==History==
According to [[Jeff Hanson (music executive)|Jeff Hanson]], head of [[Silent Majority Group]], the first new artist 360° deal was created by Hanson along with attorneys Jim Zumwalt and Kent Marcus, and Jim's partner Orville.&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html |title=Interview with Jeff Hanson |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=September 20, 2010 |accessdate=October 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103105151/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html |archivedate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was submitted to [[Atlantic Records]] for the rock band [[Paramore]] while Hanson, Marcus and Zumwalt were employed by the label. Hanson has said there was strong resistance to the deal by both label and band and that he had to fight to make it happen, but believes his efforts were vindicated by the band's subsequent success, saying: "How else would a label have been patient enough to put the band on three straight [[Warped Tour]]s and down-streamed the band to [[Fueled by Ramen]] all while losing millions of dollars?"&lt;ref name="hitquarters"/&gt;

360 deals have been made by traditional record companies, as in [[Robbie Williams]]'s pioneering deal with [[EMI]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
360° deals have attracted criticism from various quarters. Panos Panay, CEO of online music platform Sonicbids, has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you want to find out the future of 360° deals, look at Motown in the late 60s. Motown was the pioneer of a 360° deal ... They owned your likeness, your touring, publishing, record royalties, told you what to wear, told you how to walk … It made for great entertainment but if you look at every one of those artists, what happened? Sooner or later they said, 'I’m not going to go on the road for 200 shows because you tell me so. I’m an artist! I’m a creative person!' Eventually all these artists left ... There’s two things we know about creativity: you can’t force it and you can’t really control it."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Panos_Panay_Interview.html |title=Interview With Panos Panay |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=July 5, 2010 |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Censorship ==
Numerous regional censor boards heavily edited or banned the film because they believed its discussions of childbirth would frighten women away from pursuing motherhood. British Columbia rejected the film because, "The showing of this picture would have the effect of creating a fear in the minds of expectant mothers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirby|first=David A.|author-link=David A.

'''''Agony in the Garden''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed around 1483-1493, and housed in the  [[Uffizi Gallery]],  [[Florence]]. 

==History==
The work was painted for the church of the convent of San Giusto alle mura together with the ''[[Pietà (Pietro Perugino)|Pietà]]'' and a ''[[Crucifixion (Perugino)|Crucifixion]]''. Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] saw them in side altars  of the church of San Giovanni Battista alla Calza, after the original location had been destroyed during the [[Siege of Florence (1529–1530)|Siege of Florence]] in 1529. It was moved to the Uffizi in the 20th century.

The dating of the work is disputed: it varies from 1482, the year of Perugino's return from Rome, to a slightly later period, although before the end of the century, when the artist started to use only line oil, which in these works is used only at an experimental level.

The painting was restored in 1998.
==Description==

Christ is portrayed in center of the panel above a clear sky, kneeling in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] and receiving by an angel a divine chalice. His figure forms a triangle with the three sleeping apostles at the bottom (from the left, [[John the Apostle|John]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]); the triangle is connected to the painting's sides by the symmetrical line of the hills. Behind Jesus is a lake landscape, a typical element of the Italian painting at the time, with a fortified city and an ancient bridge. 

At the sides, two groups of soldiers, led by [[Judas Iscariot]], are closing to arrest Jesus.

'''An Leabhar Breac''' ("Speckled Book"), now less commonly '''Leabhar Mór Dúna Doighre''' (The Great Book of Dun Doighre") or possibly erroneously, '''Leabhar Breac Mic Aodhagáin''' ("The Speckled Book of the [[MacEgans]]"),&lt;ref&gt;The Leabhar Breac Mic Aodhagáin is the title of a book cited by [[Geoffrey Keating]] in Book III of ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]'', described as an "old book of annals" (''seinleabhar annálach'') and probably now lost. [http://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?http://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/RIA_MS_23_P_16/english/index.html Irish Script on Screen].&lt;/ref&gt; is a medieval Irish vellum manuscript containing [[Middle Irish]] and [[Hiberno-Latin]] writings. The manuscript is held in the library of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] in Dublin, where it is catalogued as [[Royal Irish Academy|RIA]] MS '''23 P 16''' or '''1230'''.

It was most probably compiled by [[Murchadh Ó Cuindlis|Murchadh (Riabach) Ó Cuindlis]] of Bally Lough Deacker, at Duniry between the years 1408 and 1411. [[Duniry]] — Dún Daighre, Dún Doighre — in eastern [[Clanricarde]] (now east [[County Galway]]) is situated south-east of the town of [[Loughrea]], and in the medieval era was home to a branch of the bardic Clann [[Mac Aodhagáin]] (the MacEgans), who served as brehons for the O'Connors of Clanricarde.

==History==
In the 16th century, the manuscript was in the possession of the Mac Egans of Duniry, hence the older title Leabhar Mór Dúna Doighre. In 1629, when the manuscript was held in the convent of [[Kinalehin Friary|Kinalehin]], County Galway.

It was consulted by [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]], brother of the [[Annals of the Four Masters|Four Masters]], who copied pp.&amp;nbsp;272–7. The book passed into the possession of [[Eamon Ó Ceallaigh]] (Co. Roscommon) in 1732, then of Dr. John O'Brien by 1768 and finally of [[Cornelius O'Daly]] (Mitchelstown, Co. Cork). The [[Royal Irish Academy]] acquired the first volume in 1789, when General [[Charles Vallancey]] purchased it for the academy for 3 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] from Cornelius O'Daly. O'Daly also owned the second volume, which comprises nine leaves, but was unaware that it belonged to the larger volume. In 1789, this volume was acquired by [[Chevalier O'Gorman]], by George Smith of College Green in the next century and by the Academy sometime after 1844. The manuscript is held in the Academy's library in Dublin to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?http://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/RIA_MS_23_P_16/english/index.html Irish Script on Screen].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The manuscript is of a large size, measuring 40.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 28&amp;nbsp;cm, which makes it the largest Irish vellum manuscript to have been written by a single scribe.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Irish Academy, [http://www.ria.ie/library+catalogue/word/Leabhar%20Breac.doc "Leabhar Breac"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118200919/http://www.ria.ie/library%2Bcatalogue/word/Leabhar%20Breac.doc |date=November 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains 40 [[wikt:folio|folio]]s, which are written in double columns. Capitals are decorated in a simple style, with some letters having been interwoven with zoomorphic patterns and coloured in red, vermilion, yellow and blue. There are two drawings, a flower-like diagram on p.&amp;nbsp;121 and a drawing of the Crucifixion on p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?http://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/RIA_MS_23_P_16/english/index.html the images at ISOS].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The manuscript consists almost entirely of religious writings in Latin and [[Middle Irish]]. It includes homiletic ''Lives'' of [[Saint Patrick]], [[Saint Columba]], [[Saint Brigid]], [[Saint Cellach]], and [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]], the earliest version of ''[[Félire Óengusso]]'' ("Martyrology of [[Óengus Céile Dé|Óengus]]"), the ''Rule of the Céli Dé'', ''[[Aislinge Meic Con Glinne]]'' ("The Vision of Mac Conglinne"), a version of ''[[Fís Adamnáin]]'' ("The Vision of [[Adamnán]]"), ''[[Saltair na Rann]]'', ''Stair Nicomeid'' ("Gospel of Nicodemus"), ''Amra Choluim Chille'', a [[Marian litany]], and various ecclesiastical legends, hymns, catecheses and homilies. Exceptions to the predominantly religious contents are ''[[Sanas Cormaic]]'' ("Cormac's Glossary") and a history of Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, E. (ed. and tr.). "Die irische Alexandersage." [[ZCP]] 30 (1967): 71–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glosses and notes==
The numerous notes which Murchadh Ó Cuindlis jotted into the margins afford us a unique glimpse of the circumstances of the writing process. These range from everyday details like a cat straying about or a robin singing in a beautiful voice to a nearby pillage in [[Lorrha]] by a certain Murchad Ua Madagáin. A persistent object of complaint for the writer is the weather, in particular the cold.&lt;ref name="O'Neill, Leabhar Breac."&gt;O'Neill, "Leabhar Breac."&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the notes, Tomás Ó Concheanainn has been able to reconstruct the time span in which certain sections had been written. For instance, it took the scribe about 6 weeks to write 35 pages (pp.&amp;nbsp;141–75), while some parts proved more challenging, such as a column for a poem with interlinear glosses, which cost him a day.&lt;ref name="O'Neill, Leabhar Breac." /&gt;

"'''Anthology of Interest II'''" is the 18th episode of ''[[Futurama]]''{{'}}s [[Futurama (season 3)|third season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on January 6, 2002. This episode, as well as the earlier "[[Anthology of Interest I]]", serves to showcase three "imaginary" stories.
==Plot==
Professor Farnsworth hauls out his What-If Machine again, fine-tunes it, and the crew takes a look at three alternative realities.
===I, Meatbag===
[[Bender Bending Rodríguez|Bender]] asks what would happen if he were human. The simulation opens with [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] announcing that he has invented a process of reverse [[Petrifaction|fossilization]], which can turn robots and machines into organic life-forms. He uses his process on Bender, who is transformed into a human. After a short period of adaptation, Bender's self-control is overwhelmed by his new senses of taste and touch, and goes on a binge of eating, smoking, partying, and drinking alcohol. 
A week later, at the [[Nobel Prize]] judging, the Professor presents Bender, who has become an overweight blob. The committee initially condemns Farnsworth, but Bender begs them to consider his lifestyle. This inspires the scientists to spend the night in a state of wild [[hedonism]]. The next morning, the hungover committee awards Bender the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], but discover that he died the moment the party began. The "woo!" noises that the partygoers assumed were from Bender were actually caused by air escaping the many folds of fat on his body. The Planet Express crew sadly roll away Bender's corpse.
===Raiders of the Lost Arcade===
[[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] asks to see a world that is more like a video game. As the simulation starts, President of Earth [[Richard Nixon]] is preparing to sign a treaty with Ambassador [[Donkey Kong (character)|Kong]] of planet [[Nintendo 64|Nintenduu 64]]. Ambassador Kong attacks Nixon, and a state of war erupts.
Due to his extensive knowledge of video games from the 20th Century, Fry is brought to the [[Military|Mil]][[atari]] headquarters and introduced to General [[Colin Powell|Colin]] [[Pac-Man]]. Before Fry can impart his wisdom to the military, the Nintendians launch an attack on [[Washington, D.C.]], and they are forced into the escape tunnels, which resemble a [[Pac-Man]] board.
They emerge outside the Planet Express building, where the Nintendian invaders, led by [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Lrrr|Lrrr]], are blasting New New York. Fry situates himself at the controls of a rolling [[anti-aircraft artillery]] platform, and begins destroying the alien ships in a manner similar to [[Space Invaders]]. Fry is unable to destroy the final ship, which lands nearby. The invaders emerge and demand "a million allowances worth of quarters" with which to do their laundry. The Earthlings refuse. The invaders suggest they be allowed to throw their laundry in with Earth's as a compromise, and the Earthlings agree.
===Wizzin'===
[[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] asks what if she found her true home. However, when the lever is pulled to start the simulation, it hits Leela on the head and knocks her unconscious, prompting her to dream a parody of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' with Leela as [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]], Nibbler as [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]], Amy as [[Glinda the Good Witch]], Fry as the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], Bender as the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]], Zoidberg as the [[Cowardly Lion|Cowardly Lobster]], and Professor Fansworth as [[Wizard of Oz (character)|the Professor of Oz]].
Leela and Nibbler, while riding in the Planet Express ship, are taken by tornado to Oz. The ship's landing gear lands on the Wicked Witch of the East, killing her. Leela takes the witch's magic boots from her corpse and puts them on, since it is hard to find footwear in her size. She asks Amy for help getting back home, and Amy tells her that only The Professor at the Emerald Laboratory can send her home. Leela is joined in her quest by Fry, Bender, and Zoidberg. They all are captured by Wicked Witch [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]] who asks Leela to be her witch daughter. Leela happily agrees, but when Bender pops opens a celebratory bottle of champagne, the spilled liquid causes Mom to melt into nothing. They resume their journey to the Emerald Laboratory, where The Professor tells Leela to click her boot heels together and wish to be sent back home. Instead, she uses them to become a witch and turns Fry, Bender and The Professor into toads. However, a toilet overflow in the upstairs bathroom (caused by Zoidberg's use of it) leaks through the ceiling and onto Leela, causing her to melt. She wakes up to find Bender splashing water in her face and berates the crew for showing up in her wonderful dream and ruining it.

==Cultural references==
===I, Meatbag===
In a split-second establishing shot of New New York before the Professor's press conference, the towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] are seen. This episode aired on January 6, 2002, about 4 months after the towers were destroyed.&lt;br&gt;
The song that Bender becomes infatuated with as a human is "[[Conga (song)|Conga]]" by [[Gloria Estefan]]. The title of the segment is a nod to the [[Isaac Asimov]] collection of short stories ''[[I, Robot]]''.

===Raiders of the Lost Arcade===
[[File:Anthology Of Interest II SpaceInvaders.png|thumb|left|A parody of the game ''[[Space Invaders]]'']]
The "Raiders of the Lost Arcade" segment is a "non-stop barrage of game references" with jokes and allusions referencing a wide array of classic video games.&lt;ref name="GameLife" /&gt; The title is a reference to the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. The segment starts off with a sequence from ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''. "Ambassador Kong" is a reference to the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', as is [[Italy]]'s ambassador to the U.N. being [[Mario]]. The maze which the characters run through is an homage to both ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''.&lt;ref name="GameLife" /&gt; Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man both appear in the episode (Pac-Man as General Colin Pacman, and Ms. Pac-Man as his wife/widow).
The Nintendians' fleet is composed of ''[[Space Invaders]]'' ships, which move in the same pattern as those in the video game ("Drop down, increase speed, and reverse direction!").&lt;ref name="GameLife"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/12/video-games-fut.html| title=Videogames &amp; Futurama, Part 1: Raiders of the Lost Arcade| author= Baker, Chris| date= 2007-12-17| accessdate= 2008-02-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080128151750/http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/12/video-games-fut.html| archivedate= 28 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no| work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry plays to the accompaniment of a [[cassette tape]] of "[[Tom Sawyer (song)|Tom Sawyer]]" by [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. The planet Nintendu 64 is a reference to the game console [[Nintendo 64]]. When the [[Atari|Milatari]] HQ is first shown, the green tank from ''[[Battlezone (arcade game)|Battlezone]]'' is driving past.&lt;ref name="GameLife" /&gt; When the characters walk through the HQ, they go past doors labelled [[Moon Patrol]] and [[Missile Command]]. As the video game villains (Lrrr, Donkey Kong, a [[Berzerk (arcade game)|Berzerk]] robot, a [[Robotron]] brain, ''[[BurgerTime]]''{{'}}s Mr. Egg, and [[Q*bert]]) exit the landed ship, one character says the phrase "[[All your base are belong to us]]".

===Wizzin'===
The majority of the plot is a direct parody of the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', with Leela taking the place of Dorothy, Amy as the Good Witch of the North, Fry as the Scarecrow, Bender as the Tin Man, Zoidberg as the Cowardly Lion, Professor Farnsworth as the Wizard and Mom as the Wicked Witch of the West. When Leela first exits the spaceship, a parody of the [[NBC]] peacock logo is seen spreading its feathers.
==Reception==
In 2006, [[IGN]].com ranked this episode as the series' twelfth best, with "Anthology of Interest I" at number 13, in their list of the "Top 25 Futurama episodes".&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/716/716663p1.html |title=Top 25 Futurama Episodes |author=Iverson, Dan |publisher=IGN.com |date=2006-07-07 |accessdate=2008-03-22 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706054922/http://tv.ign.com/articles/716/716663p1.html |archivedate=2007-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V.

'''Pāpak Fort''' ({{lang-fa|دژ بابک}}) or '''Babak Castle'''&lt;ref name="Burke-159"&gt;Burke, Andrew and Elliott. Mark (2008) ''Iran'' Lonely Planet,  Footscray,  Victoria, Australia, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gEca_4iSNCUC&amp;pg=PA159 page 159], {{ISBN|978-1-74104-293-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{[http://[[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]]|بابک قالاسی}}), also known as the Immortal Castle or Republic Castle, is a large citadel and a National Symbol of Iranians resistance against suppression which is located on Jomhour peak in [[Qara Daq, East Azarbaijan|Karadag]] mountain range, 6&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Kaleybar|Kalibar City]] in northwest of [[Iran]]. It has been identified as the stronghold of [[Babak Khorramdin|Pāpak Khorramdin]], the leader of the [[Khurramites]] in [[Iranian Azarbaijan|Azarbaijan]] who fought the Islamic caliphate of [[Abbassids]].&lt;ref name="Burke-159"/&gt; [[Iranian Azarbaijanis]] gather at Babak Castle during the first weekend in July for the annual commemoration of [[Babak Khorramdin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2004/23-120704.htm Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ascent to the Castle is not for the infirm, elderly, or those afraid of heights. A series of long, and in places, broken steps lead the traveler to the top of a hill from where there are several choices for further ascent. The easiest is straight in front of the steps and consists of a long dirt track. As there are  no sign posts towards the Castle, walk towards the peak on your left hand side but do not leave the dirt track. You will need hiking boots, a sun hat, plenty of water, and at least 3 hours for the climb, and 2 hours for the descent. At the end of the dirt track, turn left onto the rocky mountain side, and beware of slipping. The first of sign of the ruins will appear on your left, but do not become too complacent: the actual Castle is another 2 peaks march away. The first peak has views of the Castl. After ascending a second peak, with its own ruins, you will see the Castle perched on top a jagged cliff. Ascending the Castle steps is a dangerous process, as there are sheer cliffs on your right hand side, and no protective rails or fences to prevent a fall of several hundred meters. Take extreme care of the edge, and hold on to your children. Once you have climbed the pinnacle of the cliff, you will truly appreciated the amazing effort in building and maintaining a fort at this altitude. Unfortunately, you will also have to tolerate the graffiti on the ancient walls, and young people playing chicken on top of the Castle walls. Under no circumstances should you even consider climbing these walls: first, this can damage the ancient structure, and second, a fall of several thousands of meters would lead to certain death. Nevertheless, the experience afterward is well worth the strenuous climb: the surrounding Arasbaran oak forest, jagged cliffs, mountains in the distance, and the history of the place combine to create one of Iran's most beautiful vistas.
The castle, built on 2300-2600 meter heights, surrounded by gorges as deep as 400 to 600 meters, is believed to belong to the Parthian dynasty and modified under the Sasanid dynasty. To reach the castle, one has to trek a tortuous and narrow passageway and then cross a corridor-shaped temple, 200 meters in lengths.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irantravelingcenter.com/babak_castle_iran.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Birth in Four Cultures: A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States''''' is an anthropological study of childbirth by [[Brigitte Jordan]] published in 1978.

== Background ==
Throughout the book Jordan explores the birth practices of four different cultures: the [[Yucatán|Yucatan]], [[Holland]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United States]]. In chapter four, she explains in detail why she decided to focus her study on childbirth: "I never chose to study birth. In some sense, birth chose me."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth in Four Cultures|last=Jordan|first=Brigitte|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|year=1993|isbn=0-88133-717-X|location=|pages=93|quote=I never chose to study birth. In some sense, birth chose me}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Jordan's work argues against romanticized perspectives of "early, less complex societies"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burtch|first=Brian E.|date=1981-01-01|title=Review of Birth in Four Cultures: A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden and the United States|jstor=3340150|journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology / Cahiers canadiens de sociologie|volume=6|issue=4|pages=547–549|doi=10.2307/3340150}}&lt;/ref&gt; that present childbirth as uncomplicated. Instead, she suggests that childbirth is a life-altering event in all societies, but can be understood differently by using a [[cross-cultural]] perspective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Birth-Four-Cultures-Crosscultural-Investigation/dp/088133717X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486655147&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=birth+in+four+cultures|title=Birth in Four Cultures : A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States|last=Jordan|first=Brigitte|last2=Davis-Floyd|first2=Robbie|date=1992-11-01|publisher=Waveland Pr Inc|isbn=9780881337174|edition=4th|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their edited collection, ''Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives'', [[Robbie Davis-Floyd|Robbie E. Davis-Floyd]] and [[Carolyn Sargent|Carolyn F. Sargent]] praised the book for focusing "anthropological attention on childbirth as a subject worthy of in-depth ethnographic fieldwork and cross-cultural comparison, and that inspired many others to enter the field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis-Floyd|first1=Robbie E.|last2=Sargent|first2=Carolyn F.|title=Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives|date=1997|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520207858|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan argues that birth should be examined utilizing a biosocial approach, which recognizes birth as a biological process that is shaped by social and cultural practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth in Four Cultures: A Cross Cultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States|last=Jordan|first=Brigitte|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|year=1993|isbn=9780881337174|editor-last=Davis-Floyd|editor-first=Robbie|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=xv-xvi|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a concern for medical safety, Jordan also focuses on "maternal attitudes and participation in birth, the birth setting, and the mother's selection of birth attendants."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Ronald|year=1980|title=Birth in Four Cultures|url=|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=168|pages=386–387|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan uses her observations in the field, alongside academic anthropological sources to analyze birth as it occurs in four different societies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Field method ==
As an ethnographer, Jordan and her collaborator Nancy Fuller incorporated qualitative and quantitative approaches to compare health policies and statistical data from the four birthing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=648585|title=Reviewed Work: Birth in Four Cultures: A Cross-Cultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States by Brigitte Jordan|last=MacCormack|first=Carol|date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan employed formal and informal interviews based on her [[participant observation]]. In particular, she used technological means of data collection, such as videotaping and tape recording devices, to record and review her findings and produce high-quality documentation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Jordan reflects upon the methodological and ethical responsibility in her research to justify the decision-making process of the biosocial framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=brigitte+jordan+and+interviewing+in+birth+of+four+cultures+4th+edition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kly05PRli-&amp;sig=I0qpb5Z0wky8BCG6cfJYVWd884w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT6-zPwIHSAhUM0oMKHZ2QAQoQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=brigitte%20jordan%20and%20interviewing%20in%20birth%20of%20four%20cultures%204th%20edition&amp;f=false|title=Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide|last=Frayser|first=Suzanne|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and recognition ==

=== Honors and awards ===
In 1980, Jordan received the [[Margaret Mead Award]] in recognition for ''Birth in Four Cultures''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Academic reviews ===
While much of the reception for ''Birth in Four Cultures'' has been overwhelmingly positive, some anthropologists have criticized Jordan for her exclusive focus on the social aspects of birth without much attention to religious or ideological concerns in her research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Austin|first=Martha A.|date=1979-01-01|title=Review of Birth in Four Cultures|jstor=648398|journal=Medical Anthropology Newsletter|volume=11|issue=1|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Birth in Four Cultures'' was one of the first [[Ethnography|ethnographies]] to study cross-cultural systems of birth. Jordan argued that economics, culture, and politics affect birth as a system, which led to the beginning of the sub-category of anthropology called Anthropology of Birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=ant|title=Perspectives on the Anthropology of Birth|last=Van Hollen|first=Cecilia|date=1994|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=1994|dead-url=|access-date=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Birth in Four Cultures'' has been used to advocate for preserving midwifery care in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/globalissues.asp|title=Anthropological Perspectives on Global Issues in Midwifery|last=Davis-Floyd|first=Robbie|date=2000|website=Midwifery Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Updates and editions ==
There have been four editions of the book in 1978, 1980, 1983, and 1993, including updates to the material from Jordan's continued research on the subject. The 4th edition was revised and expanded by anthropologist Robbie Davis-Floyd.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Ron Kovic - Born On The Fourth Of July.jpeg|thumb|200px|right]]
'''''Born on the Fourth of July''''', published in 1976, is the best-selling [[autobiography]] by [[Ron Kovic]], a paralyzed [[Vietnam War]] veteran who became an [[anti-war]] activist. Kovic was born on July 4, 1946, and his book's ironic title echoed a famous line from [[George M. Cohan]]'s patriotic 1904 song, "[[The Yankee Doodle Boy]]" (also known as "Yankee Doodle Dandy"). The book was adapted into a 1989 Academy Award winning [[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|film of the same name]] co-written by [[Oliver Stone]] and Ron Kovic, starring [[Tom Cruise]] as Kovic.

==Origin==
''Born on the Fourth of July'' was written in [[Santa Monica, California]], during the fall of 1974 in exactly one month, three weeks and two days.&lt;ref name="kovicweb"&gt;[http://pej.org/html/print.php?sid=2718 Born on the Fourth of July: The Long Journey Home] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030105/http://pej.org/html/print.php?sid=2718 |date=September 27, 2007 }} Ron Kovic – accessed on 8 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It tells the story of Kovic's life growing up in [[Massapequa, New York]], joining the United States [[United States Marines|Marine Corps]] right out of high school, going to Vietnam for two tours of duty, getting shot, finding himself paralyzed and in need of a wheelchair, and eventually starting a new life as a peace activist.

{{quote|I wrote all night long, seven days a week, single space, no paragraphs, front and back of the pages, pounding the keys so hard the tips of my fingers would hurt. I couldn't stop writing, and I remember feeling more alive than I had ever felt. Convinced that I was destined to die young, I struggled to leave something of meaning behind, to rise above the darkness and despair. I wanted people to understand. I wanted to share with them as nakedly and openly and intimately as possible what I had gone through, what I had endured. I wanted them to know what it really meant to be in a war — to be shot and wounded, to be fighting for my life on the intensive care ward — not the myth we had grown up believing. I wanted people to know about the hospitals and the enema room, about why I had become opposed to the war, why I had grown more and more committed to peace and nonviolence.|Ron Kovic, on writing his autobiography.&lt;ref name="kovicweb" /&gt;}}

==Differences from the film adaptation==

* Ron Kovic is shown to have confessed his supposed role in the Marine Corporal's accidental death to the deceased man's sympathetic parents and widow, who admits that she cannot find it in her heart to forgive him, but God might do so. In reality, this meeting never happened, but director Stone admits this was done to add to the inner conflict Kovic was going through and to give him some closure.&lt;ref&gt;''Born on the Fourth of July audio commentary''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kyra Sedgwick]]'s character of Donna, Ron's on-screen high school sweetheart, never existed and did not inspire him to become an anti-war activist. The film portrays Kovic watching her protest after the [[Kent State Shootings]] and get beaten up by police. Although Kovic did not witness the protest in person, he nevertheless did watch the event on television, and the memoir states that he was outraged by the treatment of the protestors, much like his feelings towards the treatment of his fellow veterans.&lt;ref&gt;''Born on the Fourth of July'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
*[[Bruce Springsteen]] dedicated his 1978 performance of "[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]" live at [[Winterland]] to Kovic, saying that he read ''Born on the Fourth of July'', and "loved the book a whole lot".  He frequently mentions the book, and his chance meeting with Kovic, before playing his song "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)#Track listing|Shut Out the Light]]". 
*Folk musician [[Tom Paxton]] adapted the book into a song of the same title on his 1977 album ''New Songs from the Briarpatch'', and met Kovic backstage at the Bottom Line Club in New York City the same year.
*American punk rock band [[Green Day]] references the title of the film in their 2009 song "[[21st Century Breakdown (song)|21st Century Breakdown]]".
* American punk rock band [[The Gaslight Anthem]] references the title of the film in their 2014 song "Rollin' and Tumblin'" on the album ''[[Get Hurt (album)|Get Hurt]]''.
* British singer [[Ed Sheeran]] references the title of the film in his rap verse in [[Taylor Swift]]'s 2017 song "[[End Game (Taylor Swift song)|End Game]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/music/2018/02/09/taylor-swift-ed-sheeran-new-behind-the-scenes-video/|title=Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran reveal the romantic inspiration for his 'End Game' rap|last=Carr|first=Mary Kate|work=EW|date=February 9, 2018|access-date=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bursledon Brickworks Industrial Museum''', often shortened to '''Bursledon Brickworks''' is a volunteer-run [[brickworks]] [[museum]] based in the village of [[Swanwick, Hampshire|Swanwick]], [[Hampshire]], England. It is thought to be the last Victorian steam-driven brickworks left in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fareham.gov.uk/leisure/discover_fareham/bbrickworks.aspx|title=Bursledon Brickworks|last=Info|first=Webmaster|date=|website=www.fareham.gov.uk|publisher=Fareham Borough Council|access-date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.erih.net/i-want-to-go-there/site/show/bursledon-brickworks-industrial-museum/|title=ERIH: Bursledon Brickworks Industrial Museum|last=|first=|date=|work=www.erih.net|access-date=7 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brick kiln, chimney, drying sheds, and the boiler and engine house at the south section of the brickworks are [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed Grade II*]] as a group on the [[National Heritage List for England]].&lt;ref name=NHLE&gt;{{NHLE|num=1233725|desc=Brick kiln, chimney, drying sheds, boiler and engine house at Bursledon Brickworks|access-date=11 March 2018|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==

===Edward Hooper===
Bursledon Brickworks started out in 1897 as ''Hooper &amp; Ashby'', a [[Southampton]]-based builders' merchants, who also made bricks. The company was co-founded by the Ashby's and the Hooper's two separate [[Quakers|Quaker]] families, both hailing from the town of [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]] in [[Middlesex]] (now part of the county of [[Surrey]]). Edward Hooper, who moved to Southampton at the age of 26 was a civil engineer and architect. In the 1851 census records, Edward is described as being both an engineer and a brick maker. He takes out a lease on Baltic Wharf in Chapel Road. It is here that Edward sets up a business as a builders' merchant and a manufacturer trading in slate. This is followed by the expansion of his business, when he takes out a lease on a second building, American Wharf, nine-years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=THE BRICKWORKS MUSEUM AT BURSLEDON A HISTORY AND GUIDE|last=|first=|publisher=Hampshire Buildings Preservation Trust|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- see this link at the bottom of the article (http://www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk/history) --&gt;

===Hooper &amp; Ashby===
In 1903, ''Hooper &amp; Ashby'' changed its name to ''The Bursledon Brick Co. Limited'' or ''(B.B.C. Ltd.),'' this coincided with the extension of the southern complex with the addition of the northern complex. This was further extended in 1935. With the extra capacity, the brickworks was producing in excess of 20 million bricks a year. They were one of the main producers of bricks in the region.&lt;ref name="Collections - Museum Buildings"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk/page.php?pageid=15 | title=The History | publisher=Bursledon Brickworks | work=www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk | accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the original machinery was moved to the Swanwick site from Chandler's Ford.

==Sport==
{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}
On 20 March, Bursledon Brickworks F.C. beat [[North Warnborough]] 4–1 in the semi-finals of the 1926 Hants Junior Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwcfsa.co.uk/centenary/|title=North Warnborough F.C. 1895-1995 (A Centenary Tribute by Anne Pitcher MBA)|last=Pitcher|first=Anne|date=|website=www.nwcfsa.co.uk|publisher=North Warnborough F.C.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Go to page 14 of 32 for N. Warborough vs B. Brickworks --&gt; The cricket team, Lower Swanwick B.C.C. won the Sarisbury and District Cricket League Division 2 championship shield.

==Post-war period==
{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}
After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the family business was amalgamated with the Sussex and Dorking Brick Company and in 1959 became [[Redland plc|Redland Holdings Ltd.]]&lt;!-- see this link at the bottom of the article (http://www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk/history) --&gt;

==Closure of the brickworks==
The brickworks finally closed in 1974, and the site was later saved from demolition by the ''Hampshire Buildings Preservation Trust''. The south section of Bursledon Brickworks which houses the brick kiln, chimney, drying sheds, boiler and engine house are [[Listed building#Grade II|Grade II*]] listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1233725|title=BRICK KILN, CHIMNEY, DRYING SHEDS, BOILER AND ENGINE HOUSE AT BURSLEDON BRICKWORKS SOUTH SECTION|last=|first=|date=|website=Historic England|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north section was demolished and the land was acquired by the [[NATS Holdings|National Air Traffic Services]]. ''NATS'' operate the [[London Area Control Centre]] and [[London Terminal Control Centre]]. As site owners, they have provided funding for the [[Swanwick, Hampshire|Swanwick]] Lakes Wildlife Reserve project managed by the [[Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fareham.gov.uk/leisure/discover_fareham/swanwicklake.aspx|title=Swanwick Lakes Wildlife Reserve|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fareham.gov.uk|publisher=Fareham Borough Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity status==
The Bursledon Brickworks Trust which ran from July 1997 – February 2007 was replaced by the Bursledon Brickworks Museum Trust in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1170043&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=BURSLEDON BRICKWORKS MUSEUM TRUST|last=|first=|date=|website=apps.charitycommission.gov.uk|publisher=Charity Commission|access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a museum==
In 2012, the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] granted the museum funding of £666,300&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/9993087.Brickworks____666_000_bonanza/?ref=rss|title=Bursledon Brickworks £666,000 lottery bonanza|last=Phillips|first=Bethan|date=18 October 2012|website=www.dailyecho.co.uk/news|publisher=''Southern Daily Echo''|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to open up the first floor of the building, create two more education spaces and employ some paid staff. Project manager Carolyne Haynes said: “We’re always under threat, in that it’s a big building that’s permanently trying to fall down and we’re permanently trying to keep it open, running it with volunteers. The most important thing about this money is we’ll be able to pay some staff to make sure we can open three days a week – that will give us a regular opening time.

“The place deserves to be recognised nationally and this is a big first step towards that.”

The grant will also help pay for improved disabled access for the museum, in Coal Park Lane, Swanwick.

Head of the South-East’s Heritage Lottery Fund, Stuart McLeod, said: “Our industrial heritage is something we should be hugely proud of – it helped build the world we live in today. Bursledon Brickworks is the perfect example of this and an incredible survivor of its time.”

==Collections==
At the heart of the museum, and the heart of the collection, is the original brick making machinery, steam engine and related smaller equipment, such as barrows, shovels and wagons, once used at Bursledon Brickworks. The steam engine and machinery were restored about 20 years ago and are operated on special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk/collections|title=Collections|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk|publisher=Bursledon Brickworks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.strollingguides.co.uk/books/hampshire/places/brickworks.php|title=Bursledon Brickworks Industrial Museum|last=Houghton|first=Anthony|date=|website=www.strollingguides.co.uk/books/hampshire/places/brickworks.php|publisher=Strolling Guides|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrance to and from the site==
[[File:Coal_Park_Lane_sign.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Coal Park Lane entrance in February 2017]] &lt;!-- [[File:Swanwick_ Lane_sign.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Swanwick Lane entrance in March 2017]] --&gt; 
The brickworks has two entrances to the site, the first on Swanwick Lane. This entrance is used by the general public and has a car park. This is also where coaches drop off passengers (group visits) and the rear entrance on Coal Park Lane. The Coal Park Lane entrance is mainly used by the staff and/or volunteers based at the site, and is where deliveries are overseen.

==Radio and television==
Back in July 2015, [[BBC Radio Solent]] presenter [[Nick Girdler]] visited the brickworks. Here he oversaw the unveiling of a new brick sculpture, affectionately known as ''the Twisted Shard''. The structure which took 5 months to build was designed by local brick lecturer and artist Joe Taylor from [[Woolston, Southampton]], in partnership with [[Michelmersh|Michelmersh Brick Holdings]]. He enlisted the help of some of his [[Southampton City College]] students to aid in the construction of ''the Twisted Shard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/leisure/news/13424506.Brickie_s_artwork_to_be_unveiled_at_festival/|title=Brickie's artwork to be unveiled at festival|last=|first=|date=16 July 2015|website=www.dailyecho.co.uk/leisure|publisher=''[[Southern Daily Echo]]''|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbhplc.co.uk/twisted-shard-multi-sensory-brick-design|title=The Twisted Shard a multi-sensory brick design|last=|first=|date=22 June 2015|website=www.mbhplc.co.uk|publisher=Michelmersh Brick Holdings PLC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jtaylorbuild.com/index.php/projects/|title=Projects|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=J Taylor Brickwork &amp; Building Contractors|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, the brickworks was featured in the last five minutes of the [[South Today|BBC]]'s – ''VE Day: First Days of Peace'' documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=BursledonBrickW|author=Bursledon Brickworks|number=598771182549217280|date=14 May 2015|title=Bursledon Brickworks on Twitter: We are in the last five minutes of BBC - VE day #ManorFarmCP and #MilestonesHCT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, a five-minute segment on Bursledon Brickworks featured on Series 14: Episode 6 of the [[BBC One]] television programme [[Antiques Road Trip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk/venue | title=Venue Hire | website=www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk | publisher=The Brickworks Industrial Museum | access-date=11 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, the museum welcomed [[Wine tasting|wine connoisseur]] [[Master of Wine|Peter Richards]] from [[Saturday Kitchen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=wineschools|author=Peter Richards MW|number=827790512505634818|date=4 February 2017|title=On today's @SaturdayKitchen I get excited about bricks.

'''Chamberlin, Powell and Bon''' was a British firm of architects whose work involved designing the [[Barbican Estate]]. They are considered one of the most important modernist architectural firms in post-war England.

== Formation ==
The practice was founded in 1952 by [[Geoffrey Powell|Geoffry Powell]] (1920–1999), [[Peter "Joe" Chamberlin]] (1919–1978) and [[Christoph Bon]] (1921–1999), following Powell's win in the 1951 architectural competition for the [[Golden Lane Estate]]. The three founding partners taught at Kingston Polytechnic (now [[Kingston University]] School of Architecture) when they each entered the design competition with the agreement that should any of them win they would form a partnership with the other two to deliver the project. The Golden Lane Estate is sometimes referred to as the apprentice piece of the practice and is important for its planned landscape which 'straddles the boundary between the picturesque and the formal'.&lt;ref&gt;[Chamberlin, Powell and Bon, Elain Harwood (foreword by [[Piers Gough]]), RIBA Publishing / [[Twentieth Century Society]], London 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-85946-397-0}}]page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Greenberg became an additional partner of the practice in 1960, although he chose not to add his name to the partnership for personal reasons. He was the only other partner working with CP&amp;B on Barbican. Frank Woods also became an additional partner, and in 1985 the firm name became '''Chamberlin Powell Bon &amp; Woods'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbicanliving.co.uk/d10a.html Barbican Living: Chamberlin Powell and Bon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219051830/http://www.barbicanliving.co.uk/d10a.html |date=December 19, 2009}}, Barbican Living&lt;/ref&gt; The firm continued to 1989. Its records are archived at the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].&lt;ref name="records"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/N13577930 |title=company archive incl drawings, perspectives, models, photographs, reports, project... |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives of the United Kingdom]] |accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main work ==
Following completion of the [[Golden Lane Estate]], they won the commission to design and execute the adjacent [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] development, also for the Corporation of the [[City of London]], the wealthy municipal administration that has responsibility for the historic core of London, today the central business district. The Barbican was such a large job they set up a sub-practice to deal with it: Chamberlin Powell and Bon (Barbican) Ltd.

The firm was strongly influenced by the work and ideas of Swiss/French architect [[Le Corbusier]],{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} with the essence of the innovative design being encapsulated by the project architect Leopold Rubinstein who trained with Le Corbusier in Paris.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Other works included two schools in London, [[New Hall, Cambridge]]  (a new college at [[Cambridge University]]) now known as Murray Edwards College, and an ambitious materplan and major expansion of the campus at [[University of Leeds]].

It is a measure of the importance of the practice in post-war British architecture that many of their works are now [[Listed Building]]s.

'''Charles MacKubin Lefferts''' (April 19, 1873 &amp;ndash; March 17, 1923) was an [[United States|American]] [[illustrator]] and [[soldier]]. He served on and off in the [[New York (state)|New York]] [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] from 1893 onwards and enlisted in the federal army in 1917. He retired from the army in 1921, having attained the rank of Lieutenant. In his early years he lived in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]], where he met his future wife Anne Harrison.

Lefferts spent most of his time outside of the military studying [[uniforms]] of the [[American Revolution]]. A self-taught artist, he recorded his meticulous research efforts by making many illustrations of uniforms used by all of the forces involved in the war and also by collection illustrations made by other artists. He was made a member of the [[New York Historical Society]] in 1909. Three years after his death, the society published many of his images and their descriptions in a book titled ''Uniforms of the Armies in the War of the American Revolution, 1775-1783''.

[[File:End papers.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Endpapers of the original run of books in the [[Everyman's Library]], 1906, based on the art of [[William Morris]]'s Kelmscott Press.]]
The '''endpapers''' or '''end-papers''' of a [[book]] (also known as '''endsheets''') are the pages that consist of a double-size sheet folded, with one half pasted against an inside cover (the pastedown), and the other serving as the first free page (the free endpaper or flyleaf). Thus, the front endpapers precede the [[title page]] and the text, whereas the back endpapers follow the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prucha  |first1=Francis |date= 1996|title=Livia Appel and the Art of Copyediting: A Personal Memoir  |journal= The Wisconsin Magazine of History  |volume= 4|issue= 4|pages=376-377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Booksellers sometimes refer to the front endpaper as FEP.  

Before mass printing in the 20th century it was common for the endpapers of books to have  [[paper marbling]].  Sometimes the endpapers are used for [[Map|maps]] or other relevant information. They are the traditional place to put [[bookplate]]s, or an owner's inscription.

{{As of|2010}}, there are many styles of endsheets or endpapers that are specifically designed for use with different bindings. For example, endsheets reinforced with cloth are used in [[Bookbinding#Stitched or sewn binding|sewn bindings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbsbind.com/endsheets/endsheets_for_side_sewing.php |title=Endsheets For Side Sewing - LBS - Bookbinding, On-Demand &amp; Packaging Materials |publisher=Lbsbind.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cloth holds the stitches and prevents the paper from perforating and tearing.

Other styles are designed for use with [[Perfect binding|perfect binders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbsbind.com/endsheets/endsheets_for_perfect_binding.php |title=Endsheets For Perfect Binding - easily create a hardcover book |publisher=Lbsbind.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined and Universal Endsheets are loaded into the cover feeder of an automatic perfect binder and attached – instead of the soft cover – automatically producing a book block reinforced from head to tail. The Folded Tabbed End sheet is collated with the text pages, milled and bound along with the book block.

There are also many styles of endpapers that are engineered to meet textbook standards and [[library binding]] standards as well as endsheets for conservation and book repair.

'''Geographers' A-Z Map Company Ltd.''' is the largest independent map publisher in the United Kingdom providing cartographic services,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.az.co.uk/?nid=689|title=Cartographic Services :: A-Z Maps|website=Az.co.uk|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital data products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdigital.co.uk|title=Home - A-Z Digital Mapping|website=A-Z Digital Mapping|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and paper mapping publications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.az.co.uk/?nid=2|title=Maps &amp; Atlases :: A-Z Maps|website=Az.co.uk|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including Street Atlases, Visitors Guides, Great Britain Road Atlases and The Adventure Atlas).

The company is based in [[Dunton Green|Dunton Green, Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.az.co.uk/?nid=39|title=Our History :: A-Z Maps|website=Az.co.uk|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
Geographers' Map Company Ltd. was established in London on 28 August 1936, by Alexander Grosz with offices in Napier House, 24-27 High Holborn. The company's most famous publication "[[Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas|The A-Z Street Atlas]]" was created by [[Phyllis Pearsall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Theatre |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/10660172/Who-was-the-woman-who-invented-the-London-A-Z.html |title=Who was the woman who 'invented' the London A-Z? |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By SARAH LYALLAUG. 30, 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/30/world/phyllis-pearsall-89-dies-creator-of-a-to-z-london-maps.html?_r=0 |title=Phyllis Pearsall, 89, Dies; Creator of 'A to Z' London Maps - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1996-08-30 |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heald |first=Claire |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5371680.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Magazine &amp;#124; From Aaron Hill to Zoffany St |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-09-25 |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; who took on the responsibility of creating the first edition. Spending hours walking the streets of London cataloguing house numbers, junctions and streets.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, Phyllis. AZ Maps: The Personal Story, from Bedsitter to Household Name. Geographers' AZ Map Company, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The company sold every copy of the first [[Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas|London Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas]], with her main customer being [[WH Smith|W.H. Smith and Sons]].

By 1938, Geographers' Map Company Ltd. was selling 12 titles, with the maps being entirely created by skilled  cartographers. With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the government ordered the removal of street maps from sale so the business produced war maps for newspapers throughout the War.

==1950s to present==
By 1952 and after an aircraft accident in 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheredelight.com/dakota.html |title=Dakota PH-TBO Civil Aviation Crash 1946 Shere Surrey |publisher=Sheredelight.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearsall|1990|p=100,111}}&lt;/ref&gt; endangering the life of Phyllis Pearsall, Geographers' Map Company Ltd. had over 30 publications covering the [[United Kingdom]] from [[London]] to [[Glasgow]]. The 1960s saw the company move to the [[Sevenoaks]] area in Kent and ownership move to the Geographer's Map Trust.

The 1970s saw both an introduction of the now iconic A-Z to the company name.

The early adoption of technology and in particular the use of CAD/CAM Unix computers, then the Windows PC accelerated the pace of map publication that resulted in a peak in sales during 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.az.co.uk/?nid=40|title=Product History :: A-Z Maps|website=Az.co.uk|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant technological developments in the industry saw the increased availability of free mapping and satellite navigation as the demand for paper production rapidly declined - ultimately resulted in the company restructure in 2013.

Geographers' A-Z Maps digital offering is growing rapidly and is already in use by charities like [[London's Air Ambulance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://londonsairambulance.co.uk/support-us/corporate/cause-related-marketing |title=Cause related marketing – London's Air Ambulance |publisher=Londonsairambulance.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; emergency services ([[London Ambulance Service]] - (featuring in the BBC documentary 'Ambulance')), public organisations and private business, providing the familiar mapping solution at street scale.

Additionally, the company has started to include licensed brand products including [[Ben Sherman]] clothing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bensherman.co.uk/clothing/polo-shirts/az-printed-collar-polo-858 |title=A-Z Printed Collar Polo Staples navy |publisher=Bensherman.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paperchase]] stationary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paperchase.co.uk/collections/a-z-collection |title=A-Z Collection at Paperchase - Official A-Z Design |publisher=Paperchase.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Olympics==
Geographers' A-Z Map Company cartographic services team&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; were the official suppliers of paper atlases and maps for the 2012 Olympic Games and 2012 Paralympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://mappinglondon.co.uk/2012/a-z-london-2012-venues-atlas/ |title=A-Z London 2012 Venues Atlas |publisher=Mapping London |date=2012-07-31 |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They produced atlases that detailed transport information for navigating to the venues as well as other information.

{{Original research|date=March 2010}}
A '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the [[protagonists]], their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of "[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. 

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, "'''happily ever after'''" or "and they lived happily ever after". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula "they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with "they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that "there were good days and bad days" afterwards.

A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': "Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. 

There is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[José Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].

===Novels===
A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carré]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his "[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). ''George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series).'' {{ISBN|0-415-15953-9}}, pp. 223–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Point of View of A Playwright," by Bernard Shaw, collected in ''Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm'' (1919). London: Hutchinson. [https://archive.org/details/herbertbeerbohmt00beer Versions at Text Archive] [https://archive.org/about/about.php Internet Archive]&lt;!--Retrieved from http://archive.org November 2[[3, 2009.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: "My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, "'What Happened Afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, G.B. (1916). ''Pygmalion''. New York: Brentano. [http://www.bartleby.com/138/6.html Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.] [http://www.bartleby.com/sv/welcome.html Bartleby: Great Books Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film "[[My Fair Lady]]".

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. 
* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.

A '''human video''' is a form of [[theater]] combining [[music]], [[Modern Dance]] and [[drama]], along with [[interpretive dance]], [[American Sign Language]], [[pantomime]], and [[Mime artistry|classic mime]]. A human video consists of a [[song]] or [[Medley (music)|medley]] played over loudspeakers while actors use rhythmic physical movement (gestures and other movements of the limbs and body) to communicate emotions to a given audience.

The performance is presented in a form similar to a [[music video]]. It presents a story that illuminates a particular artistic intent through [[Proxemics|spatial relationships]], meaningful [[gesture]]s, and artistic [[Kinesics|movement]]. 

The story told within the video can be either implicit in the words of the song or a story written independently of the original artist's meaning.

Just as more "traditional" forms of theater can be situated on different types of [[Stage (theater)|stages]], so too can these dramatic acts. This particular form of drama can perform the same text in many different venues without disrupting its meaning. Because it typically has no [[Set construction|set]] and limited [[costume]]s, it can be performed in nearly any location.

[[Theatrical property|Props]] are sometimes used, but are forbidden in some competitive venues. In this instance, props are restricted in an effort to force creativity—because in the ideal Human Video, all actors on stage should be used to represent objects like [[Crucifix|crosses]], thrones, trees or giants. Actors movements demonstrate a [[narrative|story]] and the [[Theme (literature)|theme]] of the [[song]] being played.

In the [[United States]], one example of how human videos have permeated the [[Culture of the United States|culture]] is the inclusion of human videos in Fine Arts Festivals and church ministry groups ([[Assemblies of God]], [[Pentecostal]] Holiness Church, [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], etc.) in a variety of [[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]]. The Fine Arts Festival in the Assemblies of God denomination is the largest and most intense of all competitions and categories. Churches spend many months and countless hours practicing in order to receive recognition at the National Fine Arts Festival.

==History==
The name "human video" was coined by Randy Phillips. He is reported to have performed the first "human video" in a chapel service at Central Bible College, with several elements used from the then quite popular Deaf Ministry Team. It was used more formally in the early 1990s at Phoenix First Assembly of God led by Pastor Tommy Barnett.

Although elements of the form have existed in theatre for centuries and no one can actually claim to have invented it, Mr. Phillips began to use it as a ministry tool first at church services and then for outreach and missions with the help of Pastor Lloyd Ziegler and the ministry training program called Master's Commission.

[[File:SNGCop 491.jpg|290px|thumb|right|Coins of King [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]] - 280&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
'''Illyrian coinage''' which began in the 6th century BC continued up to the 1st century of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule. It was the southern [[Illyrians]] who minted the first coins followed by the northern Illyrian during the Roman era. Illyrian coins have also been found in other areas apart from [[Illyria]], such ancient [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonia]], Italy, Greece, [[Asia Minor]] and Egypt.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Early coins==

The earliest Illyrian coins were probably minted by the Tyntenoi north of [[Lake Ohrid]] minted coins around 540&amp;nbsp;BC with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] legend [[Tynteni]]. Their silver coins reached Italy, [[Egypt]] and many parts of [[Asia]]. They belonged to the group of '[[Thraco-Macedonian]]' coinages of this period, and they bore the same emblems as the coins of [[Ichnae]] at the head of the [[Thermaic Gulf]]. Production ceased in the early 5th century BC, most likely in 475&amp;nbsp;BC when this period was one of comparative poverty, during which contacts were lost with mainland Greece and relations with Ionia via the [[Danube]] valley slackened.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Macedonia: 550–336 BC by Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond, Guy Thompson Griffith, page 93 ^ The Cambridge ancient history: The fourth century BC by D. M. Lewis, John Boardman,1994, page 427, "The silver coinage of the Tynteni ceased early in the fifth century. The period after 475 was one of comparative poverty, during which contacts were lost"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Messapians]] in southern [[Italy]] minted coins in the early 5th century BC. They were an early imitation of the Greek coins from [[Magna Grecia]]. The cities which minted these early mints were Valesio, [[Brindisi]], [[Nardò]], [[Oria, Apulia|Oria]], Ugento, Grax and Samadi. Valesio struck silver coins, Nardò silver and bronze while from the 3rd century BC only bronze coins were issued. The coins feature Lapagus, an ancient [[Iapygian]] hero. Other features included [[Athena]], [[Heracles]] and [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Messapi]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the Messapians, the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] tribe of the [[Derrones]] were also producing coins. These coins are traditionally dated to 500&amp;nbsp;BC – 450&amp;nbsp;BC. Frequent depictions on the coins attributed to the Derrones are Oxen and Corinthian helmets. Their god, Darr(h)on, was worshipped by Paionians and Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Derivation of the Greek Word Paean |author=Grace H.

However this activity in terms of quality and appearance did not differ much from Greek coins. Even the Paeonians themselves at this time were becoming hellenized more and more and lost to a great degree their characteristic as a non-Greek people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stipčević|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Illyrian coins in Illyria were minted from the start of the 4th century BC in the [[List of ancient cities in Illyria|Illyrian city]] of [[Damastion]] and Daparria&lt;ref name="wildwinds2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/illyria/damastion/i.html|publisher=wildwinds.com|title=Illyria, Damastion - Ancient Greek Coins - WildWinds.com|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Illyrian tribe]] of the [[Dyestes]] under [[Bardylis]], which had been influenced by [[Hellenization]] to an extent. For about 200 years, this city minted silver coins with symbols imitating those of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] cities in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], as well as original symbols such as tongs of a metal smelter. The circulation of Damastion coins included [[Kosovo]], southern [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and the [[Adriatic]] coast from [[Shkodër]] to [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. The presence of silver mines around the city in ancient sources made it possible for the minting of coins in such a great abundance.

==Illyrian kings==
[[File:NBHM-Rezhantsi-Treasure-Silver-tetradrachms-of-Patraus.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]]s dated back to the reign of Patraus.]]
The only kings to have minted coins bearing their names were [[Lycceius]], [[Patraus]], [[Audoleon]], [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]], [[Mytilus of Illyria|Mytilus]], [[Gentius]] and [[Ballaios]].

===Patraus===
The coinage of Patraus is remarkable. They have on the obverse a head of [[Apollo]], which may be in allusion to the king's name, Apollo being known under the name of Patraus. On the reverse of the coins is a horseman riding over an enemy, in allusion to triumphs over the Macedonians and an inscription of the king.&lt;ref&gt;The Coin collector's manual, or Guide to the numismatic student in the ... By Henry Noel Humphreys page92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audoleon===
The coins of Audoleon have a head wearing a Corinthian helmet on the obverse and on the reverse a horse stepping, very boldly executed and the inscription of the king.

===Monunius===
[[File:Silver stater, Apollonia, 340-280 BC.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]'s coin. A cow and a suckling calf. Reverse: double stellate pattern within dual linear border and the inscription A Π O Λ around.]] 
The first [[Dardani]]an king to have minted silver coins was [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]] in the beginning of the 3rd century BC, around 280&amp;nbsp;BC. He struck his coins in the Greek colony of [[Durrës]] and they differed only in having the jaw of a boar set over the cow, as a symbol of the royal Illyrian house. The coins also had the abbreviated inscription 'ΔYP' (for Durrës) to donate the place where they were minted, as well as showing royal sovereignty over the city. These coins have been found in great numbers in the Illyrian city of [[Gurazez|Gurëzeza]], and in the interior of [[Albania]] beyond [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. The Illyrian kingdom under Monunius extended as far as the [[Lyncestian]] Lakes, and from here Monunius could have intervened in the quarrel about the Macedonian throne, eventually turning into a claimant for it. This surely is the meaning of the minting of a second series of silver coins bearing his name and traditional Macedonian symbols, the head of [[Heracles]] on the face and on the reverse, Olympian [[Zeus]] sitting on his throne. That this, was a short lived dream of the Illyrian king is shown by the fact that so few coins were minted, so much that only one specimen is preserved today.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians to the Albanians by [[Neritan Ceka]] 2005, p.114 {{ISBN|99943-672-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mytilus===
[[Mytilus of Illyria|Mytilus]], the successor of King Monunius, struck his coins 10 years later around 270&amp;nbsp;BC. His bronze coinage with the symbols of the city of [[Durrës]] in Albania bear his name. The coinage of Apollonia in the same period bore only his monogram, as well as symbols similar to those of the [[Aetolian League]].&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians to the Albanians by [[Neritan Ceka]] 2005, {{ISBN|99943-672-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentius===
[[File:Face of King Gentius on Ancient Illyrian coin.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Gentius]] on a bronze coin.]]
The most productive conage is of [[Gentius]] who ruled from 181&amp;nbsp;BC. Two of his mints were located in [[Shkodra]], the ancient Illyrian capital at the time of his regn, and in [[Lezha]], both located in modern-day north-eastern Albania. His coins were also struck in [[Durrës]], where the royal title is absent from any silver coin, and the name Gentius, not uncommon to an Illyrian male, may belong not to the king but to a local magistrate. However, around 30 to 40 examples of bronze coins have been recorded with the legend 'King Genthios'. Upon his defeat by the Romans in 168&amp;nbsp;BC his treasury of 120,000 silver pieces were conveyed to [[Rome]].

===Ballaios===
[[File:Balajos.jpg|thumb|upright| King [[Ballaios]] on a bronze coin.]]
[[Ballaios]] reigned after the kingdom of Gentius was dissolved into the Roman Empire from around 167&amp;nbsp;BC – 135&amp;nbsp;BC. The abundance of the coinage of Ballaios in the region would suggest that he was a powerful and influential king although no literary of historical evidence of him exists. The coins of the well-known king Gentius are scarce in comparison to the coins of Ballaios. His silver issues are rare, but bronze coins (without the royal title) occur on [[Hvar]] in [[Croatia]], both in single finds and in hoards, and at [[Rhizon]], the ancient capital of Queen [[Teuta]], in a different series bearing the royal title. The coins of Ballaios were widely imitated in the region, sometimes so crudely that they are unintelligible. Ballaios struck coins in two cities: [[Hvar|Pharos]] and Rhizon. The weight of the bronze coins are between 1.0 and 4.5&amp;nbsp;g, while most of the documented specimens weigh between 2.0 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;g. The relativity great impact of the coinage of Ballaios is indicated by a large number of imitations of his coins. His coins are found in both the eastern Adriatic shores and frequently in Italy, which confirms the trade contacts between the two Adriatic coasts.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Épire, Illyrie, Macédoine: mélanges offerts au professeur Pierre Cabanes|author1=Cabanes, P.|author2=Berranger, D.|author3=Centre de recherches sur les civilisations antiques|date=2007|publisher=Presses universitaires Blaise Pascal|isbn=9782845163515|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=I_kFU6h77ssC&amp;pg=PA129|page=129|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Illyria: An Archaeological Exploration|author1=Evans, A.|author2=Destani, B.D.|date=2006|publisher=I.

On the obverse of his coins a bust of the king facing left to right is depicted, while on the reverse [[Artemis]] (advancing or standing) is represented, with or without a torch and sometimes carrying one or two spears. It is significant that Ballaios also had [[silver]] coins minted, which indicates his wealth and power, since elsewhere in [[Dalmatia]], silver coinage is very rarely documented from the Greek and Illyrian mints.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"/&gt;

==City coins==

[[File:Monedha Labeate.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shkodër|Shkodra]]'s coin with the inscription: 'SKOΔRI-NΩN'.]]
The coins of ancient Lissus, modern-day [[Lezha]], with the legend 'LISSITAN' began with autonomous issues under the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] influences (211&amp;nbsp;BC – 197&amp;nbsp;BC). The coins were followed later by the issues of Gentius with a ship on the reverse and a third series from the period after the kings removal. Lissus minted coins on behalf of the community of the Lissians and minted a rare coin with an inscription over the head of an Illyrian god wearing a causia type hat. The face depicted on the Lissian coins was originally though to be of King [[Gentius]], although Albanian archaeologist, [[Hasan Ceka]] was proved it to by the head of the Illyrian sea god, [[Rodon (Illyrian god)|Rodon]]. The head of [[Artemis]] and an Illyrian shield is depicted on some Lissian coins. The Shkodra coins fall into three similar groups, the first and third with the legend 'SKODRI-NON' and the second with the legend of king Gentius. In the city of Rhizon a mint was established that issued several coinages. These incleded autonomous coinages of the town, in bronze, the royal coinage of king Ballaios, in silver and bronze, most probably, the coinage labeled “Coinage from the [[Bay of Kotor|Rhizonian Gulf]]”, which has been considered as the coinage of an alliance in which [[Rhizon]] played a part, in silver and bronze.

[[File:Daorson Coin.jpg|thumb|[[Daorson]] coin with a galley on the reverse.]]
The chronology of these coinages is still not defined with precision, primarily because the historical background of their issuance remains little known. There is hardly any mention in the literary sources of the town of Rhizon, and none of the king Ballaios. However, several features of these coinages - such as the characteristics of style, elements of inscription and iconography (especially the presence of the title “basileus” on the coinage of Ballaios, and the presence of a Macedonian shield on the “Coinage from the Rhizonian Gulf”), metrology, choice of coined metals, etc. – point to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE as the general chronological framework for the activity of the Rhizonian mint and for the successive issuance of the coinages of different issuing authorities there. Around [[Lake Scutari]] the [[Labeates]] issued a rare type of bronze coin, bearing the head of an Illyrian deity and a [[Liburnian warship]] with a dolphin swimming underneath. Between 217&amp;nbsp;BC and 84&amp;nbsp;BC the city of [[Oria, Apulia|Oria]] in Italy minted coins with the head of Lapagus, the ancient Iapygian hero. In [[Daorson]] the capital of the Daorsi in modern [[Bosnia]], 39 different coins (29 bearing the image of King [[Ballaios]] from 168&amp;nbsp;BC, and 9 with a Greek inscription and a boat image) have been discovered.&lt;ref name="coe" &gt;http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/regional/see/IRPPSAAH/PTA%20Ljubljana/BH_22-PTA-APPROVED_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Money was of immense importance to the Daorsi, ensuring the tribe's independence while also confirming their well developed business, cultural and trade links with other peoples.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illyrians|author=Wilkes, J.|date=1996|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780631198079|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&amp;pg=PA177|page=177|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Illyrian coins also appeare in other ancient cities especially those in the south of Illyria, such as in the Illyrian/Greek cities of [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Pelion (Chaonia)|Pelion]] and [[Olympe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkes|first=John J.|title=The Illyrians|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1995|isbn=0-631-19807-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The koinon of the [[Bylliones]] centred on the city of [[Byllis]] minted its own bronze coins. The first coins came out around 270&amp;nbsp;BC and continued until 167&amp;nbsp;BC when the Romans dissolved the koinon.&lt;ref name="albca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albca.com/aclis/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1434|publisher=albca.com|title=www.albca.com/aclis/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1434|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joanna Hogg''' (born 20 March 1960) is a British [[film director]] and screenwriter. She made her directorial and screenwriting feature film debut in 2007 with ''[[Unrelated]]''.

==Early TV work==
After leaving school in the late 1970s, Hogg worked as a photographer and began to make experimental super-8 films after borrowing a camera from [[Derek Jarman]], who became an early mentor after a chance meeting in Patisserie Valerie in Soho.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Roddick [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/starinterviews/article-23558656-joanna-hogg-is-darling-of-film-critics.do "Joanna Hogg is darling of film critics"], ''Evening Standard'', 22 September 2008. Retrieved 14 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these, a film about a kinetic sculpture by artist [[Ron Haselden]], won her a place to study direction at the [[National Film and Television School]]. Her graduation piece  ''Caprice'' starred a then unknown [[Tilda Swinton]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Roger Clarke [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/talent-issue--the-film-director-joanna-hogg-766033.html "Talent issue - the film director: Joanna Hogg"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 29 December 2007. Retrieved 18 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On graduation, Hogg directed several music videos for artists such as [[Alison Moyet]], and won her first television commission writing and directing a programme segment for [[Janet Street Porter]]'s [[Channel Four]] series ''[[Network 7]]'', ''Flesh + Blood''. In the 1990s, Hogg directed episodes of ''[[London Bridge (TV series)|London Bridge]]'', ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'' and ''[[London's Burning (TV series)|London's Burning]]''. She also directed the ''[[EastEnders]]'' special ''EastEnders: Dot's Story'' (2003).

==Film==
Hogg has said, "I wanted to make a film doing everything I was told not to do in television."&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt; She shot her first feature, ''[[Unrelated]]'' (2008), in [[Tuscany]]. It tells the story of a childless woman, Anna (Kathryn Worth), of around forty who goes on holiday to Italy with her friend Verena (Mary Roscoe) and her teenage family. Over the course of the holiday, tensions emerge as Anna spends less time with the 'grown-ups' and is drawn towards the teenage crowd and the attractions of Verena's teenage nephew ([[Tom Hiddleston]]).

The film received critical acclaim,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/18/100-best-films-of-noughties "100 best films of the noughties: Nos 11-100"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 December 2009. Retrieved 18 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; premiering at the [[London Film Festival]] in 2007 and winning the [[FIPRESCI]] International Critics Award. It also won the Guardian First Film Award in 2008 and the [[Evening Standard British Film Awards]] 'Most Promising Newcomer' Award in 2009, as well as being nominated for their Best Film Award and earning Hogg a nomination for the [[London Film Critics' Circle]] 'Breakthrough Filmmaker' Award in 2009.

Her second film, ''[[Archipelago (film)|Archipelago]]'', shot on the island of [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] had its UK premiere at the 2010 [[London Film Festival]], where it was nominated in the Best Film category. It was released in the UK on 4 March 2011 by [[Artificial Eye]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Barraclough [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118024323?refCatId=13 "Artificial Eye nabs 'Archipelago'"], ''Variety'', 17 September 2010. Retrieved 14 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her third film ''[[Exhibition (2013 film)|Exhibition]]'' starred musician [[Viv Albertine]] and artist [[Liam Gillick]] and also featured Hogg's long time collaborator [[Tom Hiddleston]]. The film premiered at the [[Locarno International Film Festival|Locarno Film Festival]] in 2013. [[Peter Bradshaw]] writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' hailed is as 'a masterful cinematic enigma' awarding it the full five stars.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bradshaw, "Exhibition review – Joanna Hogg creates a masterful cinematic enigma" ''The Guardian'', 24 April 2013. Retrieved 21 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogg's style is influenced by European and Asian directors such as [[Eric Rohmer]] and [[Yasujirō Ozu]],&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Pasolini [http://www.kamera.co.uk/article.php/1055 "Joanna Hogg"], ''kamera.co.uk salon'', 18 September 2008. Retrieved 14 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; using extended takes and minimal camera movement. She takes the unusual approach of casting a mixture of actors and non-professional actors in her films, such as the landscape painter [[Christopher W. Baker|Christopher Baker]] in ''[[Archipelago (film)|Archipelago]]''. Her depiction of unarguably middle-class characters has prompted some commentators to see her work as spearheading a new type of social realism in British film.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Roddick "A Question Of Class", ''Sight &amp; Sound'', March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/feb/25/films-middle-classes-class-archipelago] ''The Guardian'', 25 February 2011. Retrieved 9 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
In 2015 Hogg directed [[Harold Pinter]]'s unproduced film screenplay adaptation of the short story by [[Karen Blixen]] "The Dreaming Child" for [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], adapting the screenplay with producer [[Laurence Bowen]]. It starred [[Lydia Leonard]], who worked with Hogg on her film ''[[Archipelago (film)|Archipelago]]'', and [[Bertie Carvel]].&lt;ref&gt;Moira Petty, "https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/dreaming-child/" ''The Stage'', 3 March 2015. Retrieved 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gallery exhibition and curation==
In October 2015 Hogg co-curated the retrospective exhibition of film maker Chantal Akerman's installation work, "Chantal Akerman NOW", at the Ambika P3 Gallery. This was the culmination of a two year long retrospective of Akerman's work she had programmed with Adam Roberts, with whom she founded the cinema collective [[A Nos Amours]] in 2011. The collective is "dedicated to programming over-looked, under-exposed or especially potent cinema".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anosamours.co.uk A Nos Amours]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Hogg cited a concern that 'A new generation is growing up who actually don’t know the work of directors like Tarkovsky.',&lt;ref&gt;[http://cargocollective.com/cinemanotes/For-the-love-of-it-An-interview-with-A-Nos-Amours-Joanna-Hogg-Adam An Interview With A Nos Amours Joanna Hogg Adam Roberts]&lt;/ref&gt; as a major motivation behind establishing the collective.

[[File:Brodowski Napoleon Elbe.jpg|thumb|300px|Napoleon Crossing the [[Elbe]] (1895)]]
'''Józef Brodowski''' (17 January 1828, [[Warsaw]] – 5 September 1900, Warsaw) was a Polish painter. He is referred to as '''The Younger''' to distinguish him from [[Józef Brodowski the Elder|Józef Brodowski]] (c.1775/81-1853), who apparently was not related.

== Biography ==
His father was the painter [[Antoni Brodowski]], who died when Józef was only four. From 1844 to 1851, he studied with [[Rafał Hadziewicz]], one of his father's former students, at the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.agraart.pl/nowe/artists/brodowski-jozef-polska-agra-art-aukcje-obrazy-antyki.html Biographicl notes] @ Agra Art.&lt;/ref&gt; His most important influences, however, came from [[Jan Feliks Piwarski]], a landscape painter who was one of the first in Poland to promote the concept of painting [[Plein aire|en plein aire]]. He joined a group led by [[January Suchodolski]] that travelled on painting and drawing excursions throughout the country.

In 1853, he received a scholarship and went to Saint Petersburg to enroll at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], where he studied with the battle painter, [[Bogdan Willewalde]]. He graduated in 1856 and, the following year, went to Paris to study in the studios of [[Horace Vernet]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; After a year there, he travelled in Italy, then returned to Warsaw and remained there the rest of his life.

He is primarily known for his landscapes and battle scenes. One of the most notable is a large canvas depicting King [[John II Casimir Vasa]] at the [[ Battle of Berestechko]], done together with [[Juliusz Kossak]]. Horses are a prominent feature in most of his works. From 1868 to 1890, he was a regular contributor to the magazine ''[[Tygodnik Ilustrowany]]''.

'''''Naked Vengeance''''' is a 1985 exploitation [[rape and revenge film|rape-revenge]]&lt;ref name="CohanHark2012"/&gt; film directed by [[Cirio Santiago]]. The film features [[Deborah Tranelli]] as its protagonist, actress-turned-vigilante Carla Harris. The film has since received a cult following and is often mentioned in works discussing films of the rape and revenge genre.

==Plot==

Carla Harris is living the American dream. She has a handsome and wealthy husband, Mark. On their way home from a restaurant, they spot a man attacking a woman. Mark tries to help but is killed. The man escapes when the police arrive. Russo, an officer, goes to her house and tells her that there are no witnesses. Russo says that he will contact her if they find anything.

On the way to her parents' house, Carla stops at a gas station where she sees her old boyfriend Burke and one of Burke's friends, Sparky. Later that night, Carla goes to a club and meets her old high school friends, her best friend Estelle and her husband Slob. Carla also meets David but Estelle doesn't like him. After being accosted by Burke, the local butcher, Carla goes home. While she is changing, she notices Timmy, the gardener spying on her. Later that night, the men break into her house and rape her. When her parents return, Burke grabs Mr. Harris's shotgun and kills them, as well as Timmy.

Meanwhile, in the hospital, Carla wakes up and tells the doctor that she wants revenge. Later that night, she escapes from the hospital. She goes to the closed bar, seduces the bartender and convinces him to pour wine all over his body. She steals his gun, then throws a candle at him, leaving him to burn. The next day, Carla finds Burke in his speedboat. She grabs a knife on the boat and stabs him. She then takes a grapple and throws it through his chest. She ties the other end to his boat and starts the boat, making him drown and then escapes. Carla then sneaks to Sparky's gas station. While Sparky is working on a car, Carla drops the car on him, killing him. Later that night, Carla goes to Arnie's ice company. Carla pushes Arnie in the ice cube maker. A block of ice pushes him in the cube hole, leaving him to die.

Carla goes to the ice truck when Fletch, the gang and some town locals spot her and chase her to her parents' house. Carla blocks the doors and hides in a corner. The men start to burn the house down, but Carla goes into the basement and escapes through a vent. When the Sheriff asks Fletch about the burning, he claims he knew nothing about it. Later that night, Fletch is alone in the butcher shop. Carla arrives and the two fight. Carla finds the shotgun that Fletch used to kill her family and kills him with it.

Two months later, in New York, Carla finds the man who killed her husband. She seduces him, then grabs his gun and shoots him. She then walks away in tears.

==Production==
The film, a Westbook Brooks production in association with D.S., was directed by Cirio H. Santiago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2505917911.html|publisher=VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever|date=January 1, 2008|title=Naked Vengeance}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was shot in [[New York City]] and [[Connecticut]]. The screenplay was written by Reilly Askew and Anthony Maharaj. While the film has been frequently thought of as an unofficial remake of [[Meir Zarchi]]'s ''[[I Spit On Your Grave]]'' (1978) since both movies share a similar storyline,&lt;ref name="CohanHark2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMG/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelmes2012"/&gt; this claim has neither been refuted nor acknowledged.&lt;ref name="Green1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Green|title=Cracks in the Pedestal: Ideology and Gender in Hollywood|year=1998|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=1-55849-120-1|pages=189–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeatter2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan L. Yeatter|title=Cinema of the Philippines: A History and Filmography, 1897-2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6saAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company Incorporated Pub|isbn=978-0-7864-3047-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Tranelli]], best known for her longtime role in the soap opera ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', was cast as the lead character and protagonist, actress-turned-vigilante Carla Harris. Not having a [[stunt double]], Tranelli did her own action exploits. The theme song was performed by her as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QRAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y3IFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2009%2C4878602|title=Tranelli Shares Love Of Cooking, Favorite Pasta Recipe|author=Loreen Arbus, Norm Chandler Fox |newspaper=[[Copley News Service]]|date=June 19, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kaz Garas]], [[Rosemarie Gil]], Ed Crick, Nick Nicholson and [[Terrence O'Hara]] also star in the film, while [[Carmen Argenziano]] has a [[cameo appearance]] as a detective.&lt;ref name="Critic1"/&gt;

==Reception==
''[[AllMovie]]'' noted the film "obviously takes its inspiration from ''I Spit On Your Grave''", but added that the film "is likely to amuse exploitation fans" due to it going to lengths to be more outrageous than its predecessor and becoming a self-parody by being overt in presentation of the heroine enduring a brutal rape and then having to witness her own parents being killed in front of her resulting in her seeking revenge. The reviewer cautioned viewers and concluded, "The end result is as subtle as a flying mallet and ragged in both the acting and technical departments but Deborah Tranelli delivers a brave, surprisingly strong performance as the beleaguered heroine and the film uses that performance to its benefit by having her in the majority of its scenes. To sum up, ''Naked Vengeance'' might be derivative schlock but it has a certain crude effectiveness that will appeal to [[grindhouse]] fans.&lt;ref name=AMG&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guarisco|first1=Donald|title=review: Naked Vengeance (1985)|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/naked-vengeance-v34407/review|publisher=[[All Movie Guide]]|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine ''Critical Condition'' (which focuses on "obscure &amp; bizarre films on video and DVD") described ''Naked Vengeance'' as " a perfectly crazy rip-off of ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]'' (1978), maybe even outdoing it in sheer sleaze factor alone," and judges it to be Santiago's "crowning achievement".&lt;ref name="Critic1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.critcononline.com/thriller%20part%202.htm#Naked%20Vengeance |title=Review of ''Naked Vengeance''|accessdate=June 4, 2014|publisher=Critical Condition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a methodology that polls viewers to measure their "satisfaction" with the picture, ''HBO's Guide to Movies on Videocassette and Cable TV'' gave this film a four-star rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andy |last=Wickstrom|url=http://articles.philly.com/1991-02-21/entertainment/25775205_1_video-stores-history-of-home-video-top-selling-video|title=''Die Hard 2'' Sets Home-video Mark|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=February 21, 1991|quote=So, looking for something good on HBO tonight? How about ''Naked Vengeance'' with Deborah Tranelli and Kaz Garas? It sounds trashy, but it has four stars.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his short review for the ''Sydney Morning Herald'', David Frith described the character Harris as "a sort of female [[Charles Bronson]], wreaking bloody revenge on male hoodlums."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Frith|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hzZWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5567%2C5695434|title=Iron-pumper Takes To Pumping Lead|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=June 23, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In analysing the film in his work ''Screening the Male: Exploring Masculinities in the Hollywood Cinema'', Steve Cohan compares it with ''I Spit On Your Grave'' and postulates that the film's castration scene is a partial representation of "a male death wish". He adds that "there is no doubt that the audience is intended to enjoy his save punishment".&lt;ref name="CohanHark2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steve Cohan|author2=Ina Rae Hark|title=Screening the Male: Exploring Masculinities in the Hollywood Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3ZvIZA3Jo0C&amp;pg=PA129|date=10 September 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90009-1|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar conclusion is made in ''Introduction to Film Studies'', in which author Jill Nelmes argues that ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' samples elements from ''Naked Vengeance'' and ''I Spit On Your Grave'',&lt;ref name="Nelmes2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jill Nelmes|title=Introduction to Film Studies|date=12 March 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77715-8|pages=290–}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Annette Kuhn]] likens it to ''Violated'' (1984) and ''Shame'' (1987).&lt;ref name="Kuhn1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annette Kuhn|author2=Susannah Radstone|title=The Women's Companion to International Film|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08879-5|pages=432–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natalia Ginzburg''', {{née|'''Levi'''}} ({{IPA-it|nataˈliːa ˈɡintsburɡ|lang}}; {{IPA-de|ˈɡɪntsbʊɐ̯k|lang}}; 14 July 1916 – 7 October 1991), was an [[Italians|Italian]] author whose work explored family relationships, politics during and after the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] years and [[World War II]], and philosophy. She wrote novels, short stories and essays, for which she received the [[Strega Prize]] and [[Bagutta Prize]].  Most of her works were also translated into English and published in the United Kingdom and United States.

An [[activist]], for a time in the 1930s she belonged to the [[Italian Communist Party]]. In 1983 she was elected to Parliament from Rome as an Independent.

== Early life and education ==
Born in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]] in 1916, Ginzburg spent most of her youth in [[Turin]] with her family, as her father in 1919 took a position with the [[University of Turin]]. Her father, [[Giuseppe Levi]], a renowned Italian [[histologist]], was born into a Jewish Italian family, and her mother, Lidia Tanzi, was Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/ginzburg-natalia "Natalia Ginzburg], JWA Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/natalia-ginzburg-salem/natalia-ginzburg "Natalia Ginzburg], E-Notes&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were secular and raised Natalia, her sister Paola (who would marry [[Adriano Olivetti]]) and her three brothers as atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/nataliag.htm |title=Natalia Ginzburg |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901034417/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/nataliag.htm |archivedate=1 September 2006 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their home was a center of cultural life, as her parents invited intellectuals, activists and industrialists.  At age 17 in 1933, Ginzburg published her first story, ''I bambini'', in the magazine ''[[Solaria (magazine)|Solaria]]''.

== Marriage and family ==
[[File:Natalia and Leone Ginzburg.gif|thumb|240px|Natalia and [[Leone Ginzburg]]]]
In 1938, she married [[Leone Ginzburg]], and they had three children together, Carlo, Andrea, and Alessandra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Griliches Family History|first=Zvi|last=Griliches|authorlink=Zvi Griliches|editor=Max Michelson|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son [[Carlo Ginzburg]] became a historian.

Although Natalia Ginzburg was able to live relatively free of harassment during World War II, because of Leone's [[anti-Fascist]] activities, her husband was sent into [[Exile|internal exile]], assigned from 1941–1943 to a poor village in [[Abruzzo]]. She and their children lived most of the time with him.&lt;ref name=Castronuovo/&gt;

Opponents of the [[Fascist]] regime, she and her husband secretly went to [[Rome]] and edited an anti-Fascist newspaper, until Leone Ginzburg was arrested. He died in 1944 after suffering severe torture, including [[crucifixion]], in jail.&lt;ref name=Castronuovo&gt;{{citation |last=Castronuovo |first=Nadia |title=Natalia Ginzburg : Jewishness as Moral Identity |year=2010 |publisher=Troubador Publishing UK |isbn=978-1-84876-396-8|url=http://www.troubador.co.uk/book_info.asp?bookid=1156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Ginzburg married again, to [[Gabriele Baldini]], a scholar of English literature. They lived in Rome. He died in 1969.

== Career ==
After her marriage, she used the name ''Natalia Ginzburg'' (occasionally spelled "[[Ginzberg]]") on most subsequent publications. Her first novel was published under the [[pseudonym]] ''Alessandra Tornimparte'' in 1942, during [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]]'s most [[anti-Semitic]] period, when Jews were banned from publishing.

Ginzburg spent much of the 1940s working for the publisher [[Giulio Einaudi Editore|Einaudi]] in Turin in addition to her creative writing. They published some of the leading figures of postwar Italy, including [[Carlo Levi]], [[Primo Levi]], [[Cesare Pavese]] and [[Italo Calvino]]. Ginzburg's second novel was published in 1947.

The experiences that she and her husband had during the war altered her perception of her identification as a [[Judaism|Jew]]. She thought deeply about the questions aroused by the war and the [[Holocaust]], dealing with them in fiction and essays. She converted to [[Catholicism]], arousing controversy among her circle, because she believed that Christ was a persecuted Jew.&lt;ref name=Castronuovo/&gt;

Beginning in 1950, when Ginzburg married again and moved to Rome, she entered the most prolific period of her literary career. During the next 20 years, she published most of the works for which she is best known. She and Baldini were deeply involved in the cultural life of the city.

In 1964 she played the role of [[Mary of Bethany]] in [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]''.

Ginzburg was politically involved throughout her life as an activist and [[polemic]]ist. Like many prominent anti-Fascists, for a time she belonged to the [[Italian Communist Party]]. She was elected to the [[Italian Parliament]] as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] in 1983.

}}'''''Pornocrates''''', '''''Pornokratès''''', '''''La dame au cochon''''', or '''''The Lady with the Pig''''' is a work by the Belgian artist [[Félicien Rops]], created in 1878. It is part of the collection of the Musée provincial Félicien Rops in [[Namur]], Belgium.

The work in Namur is 75&amp;nbsp;cm high and 48&amp;nbsp;cm wide, executed in [[gouache]] and [[Watercolor painting|watercolor paint]] heightened with [[pastel]] on paper. Reproductions of the work ([[soft-ground etching]]s, [[Photogravure|heliogravures]] and [[aquatint]]s, sometimes colored) are also present in other museum collections, such as the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]], the [[National Museum of Western Art]] and the [[Rijksmuseum|Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]].

== Description ==
''Pornocrates'' is considered the best-known work by Rops.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museerops.be/oeuvre/2006042001/|title=Pornocratès, 1878|last=Leblanc|first=Véronique|date=20 April 2006|website=Musée provincial Félicien Rops Namur|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was realized at a time when Rops was 45 years old and lived in Paris together with the sisters Léontine and Aurélie Duluc, who both were his [[Mistress (lover)|mistresses]] and became mothers to his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lesoir.be/1135786/article/soirmag/soirmag-histoire/2016-02-29/felicien-rops-pornokrates|title=Félicien Rops: Pornokratès|last=Smets|first=Joëlle|date=3 March 2016|website=lesoir.be|publisher=Le Soir|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the work can be translated as "the ruler of [[fornication]]". According to his own correspondence, Rops produced this painting "in an overheated apartment, full of different smells, where the [[Opopanax (plant)|opopanax]] and [[cyclamen]] gave me a slight fever conductive towards production or even towards reproduction".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Letter from Félicien Rops to H. Liesse, 1879.&lt;/ref&gt; The work depicts a woman, holding a [[Domestic pig|swine]] on a leash, viewed from the left side. The woman, said to be a [[courtesan]], is almost naked, with the exception of long black silk gloves, a [[blindfold]], a plumed hat, black shoes and stockings, and a band of gold and blue silk – accessories which only emphasize her nakedness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAsiQA7msZE Felicien Rops Pornocrates] – YouTube video with interpretation of the work&lt;/ref&gt; Above the pig with golden tail, three winged [[Putto|putti]] fly away in what looks like shock or horror. Rops refers to them as "Three loves – ancient loves – vanish in tears".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Meaning of the work ==
Various interpretations for the work exist. The woman can be seen as a powerful female, led by the hog, which can be seen as an image of man, in a bestial, submissive and ignorant state, kept in check by the woman. The pig with golden tail can also be seen as an [[allegory]] for [[Luxury goods|luxury]], or even as an animal of the [[devil]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a symbol of fornication, steering the woman in [[Visual impairment|blindness]]. In any case the work represents Rops' vision of the woman of his time: a ''[[femme fatale]]'' who was increasingly [[Assertiveness|assertive]], ruthless and [[Seduction|seductive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rijksmuseumamsterdam.blogspot.nl/2013/02/felicien-rops-pornocrates-1878-musee.html|title=Félicien Rops: Pornocrates (1878); Musée Félicien Rops, Namur|last=Dorhout|first=Pauline|date=10 February 2013|website=The World According to Art|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "She was the human animal viciously depicted by Félicien Rops as "Pornokrates", ruler of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon's]] "Pornocracy", a creature blindly guided by a hog, the symbol of [[Circe]], the bestial representative of all sexual evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idols of Perversity. Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin-de-Siècle Culture|last=Dijkstra|first=Bram|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986|isbn=9780195037791|location=Oxford|pages=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878 - Frieze with the Arts.jpg|left|thumb|500x500px|Frieze with the Arts]]
The woman and pig are walking on top of a [[marble]] stage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museerops.be/tech/drawing/pornokrates.html|title=Drawing – Pornokratès|last=|first=|date=|website=Musée Félicien Rops|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a frieze depicting four allegories of the arts: sculpture, music, literature and painting. The fine arts are depicted as grey, [[Classics|classical]] male figures, looking desperate. This might be interpreted as the victory of sensuousness and eroticism of the art that Rops and his contemporaries of the [[Decadent movement]] created, in contrast with the boredom of the [[academic art]] of that era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The title may also refer to the concept of [[Saeculum obscurum|pornocracy]], a period in the [[History of the papacy]] during the first half of the 10th Century where the Popes were strongy influenced by a corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Counts of Tusculum|Theophylacti]]. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon published his [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] tract ''La Pornocratie ou les femmes dans les temps modernes'' in 1875, three years before Rops worked on his ''Pornocrates''.

An early owner of the work was the Belgian jurist and art collector [[Edmond Picard]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ''Pornocrates'' was received with indignation and scandal during the 1886 exhibition of the [[Les XX|Cercle des XX]], an art group to which Rops belonged.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.numeriques.be/index.php?id=6&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_portailnumeriques_pi1%5Bview%5D=item_detail&amp;tx_portailnumeriques_pi1%5Bid%5D=peps%3AMAR-ROPS-APC193&amp;tx_portailnumeriques_pi1%5Bnum%5D=3|title=Pornokratès ou La Femme au cochon|last=|first=|date=|website=numeriques.be|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rachel Albeck-Gidron''' (born 1960) is an Israeli inter-disciplinary researcher of  Hebrew and comparative [[literature]], [[philosophy]] and [[art]].

==Research==
In her book, ''The Century of the Monads'', Albeck-Gidron claims that there is a deep similarity and even a relationship between [[monadology|monadic]] [[metaphysics]] and the basic assumptions of [[modernism|modernistic]] thought. This claim is demonstrated in 20th-century scientific thought patterns, in the central movements in plastic art from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and, particularly, in the world view of the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] [[novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=The Century of the Monads: Leibniz's Metaphysics and 20th-Century Modernity |location= |publisher=Bar-Ilan University Press |isbn= |year= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also developed a theoretical model of describing  the process of creation of  textual-versions and created a method of comparing between them, named 'the third text'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=The 3rd text – a theoretical and methodological principle in comparative research, and its application in comparison of the versions of Berdyczewski's story 'Urva Parch' |journal=Sadan |volume=4 |year=2000 |issue= |pages=323–352 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albeck-Gidron examines the [[Ashkenaz]]i [[Pronunciation]] of [[Hebrew]] as a [[Postmodernism|Postmodernistic]] Question, in a part of a [[sociological]] discussion in a problem known as 'invention of tradition'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=Exiled and Suppressed Voices: On the Ashkenazi Pronunciation of Hebrew as a Postmodernistic Question |journal=Jerusalem Studies in Hebrew Literature |volume=19 |issue= |year=2003 |pages=69–90 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also analyzed the work of [[Yoel Hoffmann]] in the light of western and eastern poetics.

Albeck-Gidron is Associate professor of Hebrew literature at [[Bar Ilan University]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biu.ac.il/faculty/tomy/&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, she has been appointed as visiting associate professor at [[Stanford University]] and taught the course "East West East in Israeli Literature: The Novels of Yoel Hoffmann".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/dept/jewishstudies/people/scholars_2006_07.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Albeck-Gidron studied [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] [[painting]] with painter [[Israel Hershberg]] at the [[Jerusalem Studio School]] in [[Jerusalem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2933">'''Religious views on capitalism''' have been philosophically diverse, with numerous religious philosophers defending the natural [[right to property]] while simultaneously expressing criticism at the negative social effects of materialism and greed.  

==Christian views==

===''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''===
''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' influenced large numbers of people (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprise]]s and engaging in [[trade]] and the accumulation of [[wealth]] for investment.

===Christian socialism===
The first [[Socialism|socialists]] drew many of their principles from [[Christianity|Christian]] values (see [[Christian socialism]]) against the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] values of profiteering, greed, selfishness and hoarding. [[Liberation theology]] is a school of theology within Christianity, particularly in the [[Catholic Church]]. It emphasizes the Christian mission to bring justice to the poor and oppressed, particularly through political activism. Its theologians consider sin the root source of poverty, the sin in question being exploitative capitalism and class war by the rich against the poor. In the United States,  the [[Social Gospel]] was pursued in response to increased ideas of capitalist ideas and [[social Darwinism]], calling on protections of people against perceived threats from industrialization.

==Muslim views==
{{See also|Islamic socialism}}

===Legislation against riba===
Usury or [[riba]] is prohibited and religious law encourages the use of capital to spur economic activity while placing the burden of risk along with the benefit of profit with the owner of the capital. A 2.5% alms tax (''[[zakat]]'') is levied on all gold, crops and cattle.

===Opposition in Egypt and Iran===
[[Sayyid Qutb]] denounced [[capitalism]] in ''[[The Battle Between Islam and Capitalism]]'', published in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/551/000113212/ Sayyid Qutb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic constitution of Iran which was drafted by mostly Islamic clerics (see the [[Assembly of Experts]]) dispraises the "materialist schools of thought" that encourage "concentration and accumulation of wealth and maximization of profit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/ir00000_.html ICL - Iran - Constitution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malcolm X]] was also critical of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;''From Civil Rights to Black Liberation: Malcolm X and the Organization of Afro-American Unity'', William W. Sales, [[South End Press]], 1994, {{ISBN|0-89608-480-9}}, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scottish Community Drama Association''' (SCDA) is an association of amateur dramatic clubs throughout [[Scotland]]. It was first founded in 1926. Amateur theatre companies in Scotland have generally presented repertoire in [[English Language|English]], [[Scots Language|Lowland Scots]] and, more occasionally, [[Scottish Gaelic]]. 

The '''SCDA''' was founded during the period of the [[Scottish Renaissance]], a time of increasing calls to revive many of the cultural and political institutions in Scotland which were perceived as moribund at this period, including native theatre. Serious professional theatre in Scotland had more or less lapsed by the 1880s and the first twentieth century attempt to revive it faltered with the demise of [[Alfred Wareing]]'s short-lived [[Glasgow Repertory Theatre]] (founded in 1909) which closed down on the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Its remaining funds were used in the early 1920s to found the amateur [[Scottish National Players]] with the goal to promote native theatre. During the [[interwar years]] all such initiatives had their origins in the [[amateur theatre]] movement, in particular Glasgow's [[Curtain Theatre (Glasgow)|Curtain Theatre]] (1932–39) founded by [[Grace Ballantyne]], [[Scottish People's Theatre]] and [[Glasgow Unity Theatre|Glasgow Unity]]. 

No teaching institutions offered formal provision for training in Scottish styles of performance or [[diction]] until the establishment of the Glasgow College of Dramatic Art in 1950 (as part of the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama|Royal Scottish Academy of Music]]). as a consequence, most of Scotland's ground-breaking mid-twentieth century native actors, such as [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan Macrae]], [[Roddy McMillan]] or [[Molly Urquhart]], first developed their skills and methods through performance with the more innovative non-professional companies listed above. Similarly, native playwrights who wished to present authentic representations of Scottish life on the stage, such as [[Joe Corrie]], [[Robert McLellan]], [[John Brandane]], [[Ena Lamont Stewart]] and others, first came to attention generally through amateur productions of their plays. 

[[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] playwrights in particular were well served by non-professional theatre at a time when voicing for professional actors in [[Great Britain|Britain]] was dictated by [[received pronunciation]]. Miscasting in professional productions of McLellan's Scots plays was a regular complaint for the playwright, often in contrast to amateur productions of his Scots in which actors without formal training gave sympathetic and authentic delivery of the language. 

After [[James Bridie]]'s establishment of the [[Citizens Theatre]] in 1942, Scotland finally began to develop a native professional theatre. 

After the introduction of [[television]] during the 1950s, the number of amateur companies in Scotland, in common with the situation elsewhere, began to decline from its peak in the 1940s, but it still remains a vigorous part of Scottish cultural life. 

The SCDA has maintained a successful annual one-act drama festival since its inception, with one interregnum of five years (1940–45) during the Second World War.

[[File:Pissarro - La cueillette des pois.jpg|thumb|''Picking Peas'', Camille Pissarro, gouache, 1887. Part of the Bauer collection recovered in France in 2017.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;]]

'''Simon Bauer''' (1862–1947) was a Jewish businessman in France and a collector of Impressionist art. His collection was stolen by the Vichy government in October 1943. While some works have been recovered, most are still missing. The Simon Bauer collection included 93 works from the [[Impressionism|Impressionist movement]]. Since the [[liberation of France]], some of the canvases have reappeared at auctions or exhibitions in museums.

==Early life==
Simon Bauer was born in 1862 to a humble background. He made a fortune in the footwear business, selling his holdings at the age of 40, at which point he began to travel the world to make up for his lack of education.&lt;ref name=20mins/&gt;

==Art collection==
According to the inventory taken at the time of its appropriation on 10 October 1943, Bauer's art collection comprised more than 90 works that included eleven by [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], four by [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], four by [[Eugène Boudin|Boudin]], and one each by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] and [[Berthe Morisot]]. The sale was entrusted to a merchant designated by the General Commissariat for Jewish Affairs ({{Lang-fr|Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives}}).

The following year, in the summer of 1944, Bauer was interned at the [[Drancy internment camp]] but saved from deportation and likely death by a railway strike.&lt;ref name=20mins/&gt; He was released in September 1944 and tried to recover the paintings that had been stolen from him, but with little success. Some of them{{Which one|date=January 2018}} are kept in the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris, but most have disappeared.

==Death and legacy==
Bauer died in 1947. His grandson, Jean-Jacques Bauer, has attempted to recover his grandfather's paintings. In 1965, he managed to locate two Pissarros but could not get restitution. In 2013, the "treasure of Munich" was found in the hoard held by [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]]. In May 2017, Pissarro's ''Picking Peas'' (1887) was discovered at the [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] to whom it had been lent by [[Bruce Toll|Bruce and Robbi Toll]], Jewish-American art collectors, for an exhibition. They had bought the painting in good faith for $800,000 at [[Christie's]] New York in 1995. A French court ordered the painting's restitution to the Bauer family without compensation to the Tolls.&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Art collectors ordered to give back looted painting", Adam Sage, ''The Times'', 8 November 2017, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20mins&gt;[http://www.20minutes.fr/paris/2063047-20170506-toile-pissarro-spoliee-pendant-seconde-guerre-mondiale-reapparait-musee-paris Une toile de Pissarro spoliée pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale réapparaît dans un musée à Paris.] 20minutes.fr AFP, 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2976">'''The Stecher and Horowitz Foundation''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] organization in [[New York City]] founded by [[Melvin Stecher and Norman Horowitz]], duo-pianists, music educators, composers, and educational consultants. Founded in 1975, the Foundation was an outgrowth of The Stecher and Horowitz School of the Arts in Cedarhurst, New York, where Messrs. Stecher and Horowitz served as directors for 39 years (1960–1999).

The Foundation provides mentorship, career guidance, artistic development, and performance opportunities for young pianists through the [[New York International Piano Competition]] (NYIPC) and the Young Artists Series. Instituted in 2002, NYIPC was originally open to American pianists, citizen-born, naturalized or full-time international students with student visas, ages 14–18. In 2009, the competition began to accept applications worldwide, effective the summer of 2010; it also expanded its age category upwards from 14–18 years to 16–21 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hemsingpr.com/artist/the-new-york-international-piano-competition.php&lt;/ref&gt; Winners of the NYIPC are awarded concert and recital appearances in the Foundation's Young Artists Series, which includes performance venues in New York, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C.

The Stecher and Horowitz Foundation, in association director Lucy Bruell, has produced three documentary films about NYIPC, which give a glimpse into the motivations and aspirations of the competitors and their families.

'''Speaking with Music''' (2002) is a one-hour documentary about a group of young pianists and how they express themselves emotionally and intellectually through their art. The film also presents a portrait of Melvin Stecher and Norman Horowitz, the duo pianist team who created the competition, contrasting what it was like for them as young performers in the 1950s with the challenges young pianists face today.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0943986/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beyond the Practice Room''' (2004) explores what motivates young pianists to perform and to take risks on stage, to experiment as artists. Parental influence, passion for music, dreams and expectations are among the many themes that are explored in this intimate, behind-the-scenes portrait of the contestants at the New York Piano Competition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0943953/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''On a Personal Note''' (2008) explores the relationship between young classical pianists and their art, particularly how the personality and personal interpretation of each artist color a work of classical music.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856726/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Submycenaean pottery''' is a style of [[ancient Greek pottery]]. It is transitional between the preceding [[Mycenaean pottery]] and the subsequent styles of [[Greek vase painting]], especially the [[Protogeometric pottery|Protogeometric style]]. The vases date to between 1030 and 1000 BC. 

Submycenaean pottery is not very well researched, as only few sites from the period have been discovered so far. The style was first recognised in 1939 by [[Wilhelm Kraiker]] and [[Karl Kübler]], based on finds from the [[Kerameikos]] and Pompeion cemeteries in [[Athens]] and on [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. The existence of the style remained disputed among archaeologists until later discoveries in [[Mycenae]] clearly showed the existence of separate Late Mycenaean and Submycenaean [[stratigraphy|strata]]. 

Submycenaean pottery occurs primarily in contexts such as [[inhumation]]s and stone-built cist graves. Find locations are widely distributed, suggesting a settlement pattern of hamlets and villages. Apart from the sites mentioned above, Submycenaean pottery is known from locations such as [[Corinth]], [[Asine]], [[Kalapodi]], [[Lefkandi]] and [[Tiryns]].

The quality of the vases varies widely. Only few shapes were produced, especially [[stirrup jar]]s with a pierced shoulder, [[Belly Amphora|belly amphora]]e and [[neck amphora]]e, ''[[lekythos|lekythoi]]'' as well as jars, some with trefoil-shaped mouths. By the end of the Submycenaean period, the stirrup jar was replaced by the ''lekythos''.  Submycenaean decoration is rather simple, the hand-painted motifs are limited to horizontal or vertical wavy lines, single or double hatched and overlapping triangles, as well as single or multiple concentric semicircles. The shoulders of ''lekythoi'', amphorae and stirrup jars bore ornamental decoration. Amphorae, ''[[amphoriskos|amphoriskoi]]'' and jugs were usually painted with one or several thick wavy lines. In general, the style was much shorter and less carefully made than the previous types of pottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to BBC, the refrigerator 'can stay at 4C for more than 10 days without power, and is used mainly in Africa' to store vaccines and other medical supplies. It can be powered by electricity or solar and uses the physics of water to store energy, thus not relying on batteries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-21784159 "Vaccine fridge firm's Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grant"]. ''BBC News'', 14 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/technology/article4086699.ece

In 2013 the technology that uses an ice-mass to maintain refrigerator temperature without power won a $100,000 research award from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaved, Andrew. [http://www.racplus.com/news/vaccine-technology-wins-grant/8643407.article "Vaccine technology wins grant"]. ''Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Magazine'', 26 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the company was awarded a further $1.4 Million from the Gates Foundation to develop a life-saving vaccine cooler as part of the foundation’s goal to eliminate preventable diseases worldwide. 

== The Inventor ==

Ian Tansley is the inventor of the technology in Tywyn, Wales with extensive experience in cooling technologies. Tansley spent many years working with vaccine refrigerators in some of the world’s most inhospitable places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypost.co.uk/business/business-news/chilled-out-entrepreneur-gets-further-4713867 "Chilled out entrepreneur gets a further £1m investment"].

== Advisory Board ==

In 2013, both [[Richard Feachem|Sir Richard Feachem]] and [[Sir John Houghton]] were announced as Advisory Board members to The Sure Chill Company. Sir Richard stated “It is my view that Sure Chill technology will make a huge contribution to childhood
vaccination programs worldwide, especially in poorer communities.” Whilst Sir John stated “ Sure Chill Technology has the potential to improve living conditions and healthcare of populations in some of the poorest countries, and to lessen the impact of global warming on mankind. There can be no greater purpose.”

'''''The Glass Shield''''' is a 1995 American [[crime film|crime]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]].  It stars [[Michael Boatman]] and [[Lori Petty]] as rookie police officers who uncover a conspiracy around the arrest of a suspect ([[Ice Cube]]).  After a festival run, it was released in the United States on June 2, 1995, and grossed $3.3 million.

==Plot==
John "J. J." Johnson is a rookie deputy sheriff in the [[Los Angeles Sheriff's Department]].  Because of his inexperience and race, he  experiences tension with his white colleagues as their first black deputy.  Although he initially clashes with Deputy Deborah Fields, the department's first female deputy, they strike up a friendship.  While on patrol, Johnson backs up Deputy Bono when he stops a black man, Teddy Woods, at a gas station.  When Bono runs Woods' drivers license, he finds a warrant for his arrest.  Woods reveals he has a stolen pistol in his car, and the police officers arrest him.

Deputy Fields is the second deputy to the scene of a murder, but Detectives Baker and Hall dismiss her observations.  Mr. Greenspan says a black man murdered his wife in a botched robbery, and the detectives pressure Woods to confess after they trace his stolen pistol to the murder.  Woods defiantly proclaims his innocence, frustrating his lawyer, James Locket, who advises him to show less attitude in court.  At the same time, community activist Reverend Banks raises awareness of the death of a black prisoner whom he believes to have been murdered by the police while in custody.  Johnson dismisses the concerns of his family and girlfriend, saying there is no evidence of this.

While coaching Bono on what to say at the trial, Johnson's commander, Clarence Massey, learns that Bono stopped Woods because of his race.  Frustrated, Massey instructs him to come up with a better excuse.  Bono suggests a traffic violation and later requests that Johnson back him up.  Johnson agrees, and Massey praises him for his loyalty and dependability while chastising Fields for her refusal to fit in better.  At the trial, Locket points out holes in the police testimony, making Johnson wonder if he made the right decision.  Fields joins Johnson in investigating what really happened.  With help from a whistleblower, they discover numerous cover-ups that involve Baker, Hall, and Massey.

As the trial progresses and Greenspan's testimony proves problematic, Massey has Baker murder Greenspan to prevent him from becoming a liability.  Hall, sick from cancer, dies at the station.  Tensions rise as Johnson and Fields continue pursuing their own investigation, and they become further paranoid when Johnson insists they were intentionally given faulty intelligence during a drug raid.  After Fields is hospitalized following an assault, Johnson and Baker come to blows.  Massey breaks them up and temporarily places Johnson in a jail cell.  When released, he delivers incriminating evidence to Locket that implicates Baker in various crimes, including the murder of the black prisoner and framing Woods.

The jury can not reach a verdict.  Facing a widespread investigation of police corruption that goes to the city council and mayor's office, the district attorney offers to drop the charges against Woods.  Locket, with the reluctant backing of a city councilman, instead pushes for a new trial, which the judge accepts.  Bono turns state's evidence and testifies against Johnson, admitting that the two committed perjury.  Caught up in the probe, Johnson pleads guilty and receives a suspended sentence.  After the sheriff's department is disbanded, Massey retires, Baker is sentenced to four years and is in an honor prison while appealing. The unit is disbanded and the other officers including Bono are reassigned.

{{nihongo|'''Yoko Shimomura'''|下村 陽子|Shimomura Yōko|born October 19, 1967}} is a Japanese [[composer]] and [[pianist]], primarily known for her work in [[video games]]. Shimomura has worked in the [[video game industry]] ever since graduating from the [[Osaka College of Music]] in 1988. From then until 1993, she worked for [[Capcom]], where she composed wholly or in part the scores for 16 games, including ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior]]''.&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt;

From 1993 until 2002, Shimomura worked for [[Square Co.|Square]], where she composed for a further eight games. While working for Square, she was best known for her work on the soundtrack for ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', which was her last game for the company before leaving. Starting with ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' in 2003, she began working as an active freelancer, starting up a music production company called Midiplex.&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt; Despite going freelance, she has continued to work on projects for [[Square Enix]], including all of the titles in the [[Kingdom Hearts|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]], as well as for other games such as ''[[The 3rd Birthday]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''.

Her works have gained a great deal of popularity, and have been performed in multiple video game music concerts, including one, ''Sinfonia Drammatica'', that was focused half on her "greatest hits" album, ''[[List of Square Enix compilation albums#Drammatica|Drammatica: The Very Best of Yoko Shimomura]]'', and half on the music of a previous concert. Music from several of her games have been published as arranged albums, and as piano scores.
{{TOClimit|limit=3}}
==Early life==
Shimomura was born on October 19, 1967, in [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], Japan.&lt;ref name="Yokoprofile"/&gt; She developed an interest for music at a young age, and started taking piano lessons "at the age of four or five".&lt;ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/&gt; She began composing her own music by playing the piano randomly and pretending to compose, eventually coming up with her own pieces, the first of which she claims to still remember how to play.&lt;ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/&gt; Shimomura attended [[Osaka College of Music]], and graduated as a piano major in 1988.

Upon graduation, Shimomura intended to become a piano instructor and was extended a job offer to become a piano teacher at a music store, but as she had been an avid gamer for many years she decided to send some samples of her work to various video game companies that were recruiting at the university.&lt;ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/&gt; [[Capcom]] invited her in for an audition and interview, and she was offered a job there. Her family and instructors were dismayed with her change in focus, as video game music was not well respected, and "they had paid [her] tuition for an expensive music school and couldn't understand why [she] would accept such a job", but Shimomura accepted the job at Capcom anyway.&lt;ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/&gt;

==Career==
While working for Capcom, Shimomura contributed to the soundtracks of over 16 games, including the successful ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior]]'', which she composed all but three pieces for. The first soundtrack she worked on at the company was for ''Samurai Sword'' in 1988. ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'', in 1989, was her first work to receive a separate soundtrack album release, on an album of music from several Capcom games.&lt;ref name="FinalFightalbum"/&gt; The first soundtrack album to exclusively feature her work came a year later for the soundtrack to ''Street Fighter II''.&lt;ref name="StreetFighteralbum"/&gt; While she began her tenure at Capcom working on games for [[video game console]]s, by 1990 she had moved to the [[arcade game]] division.&lt;ref name="Yokoprofile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/&gt; She was a member of the company's in-house band [[Alph Lyla]], which played various Capcom game music, including pieces written by Shimomura. She performed live with the group on a few occasions, including playing piano during Alph Lyla's appearance at the 1992 Game Music Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vgmdb.net/db/covers.php?do=view&amp;cover=118586|title=VGMdb|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Shimomura left Capcom to join another game company, [[Square Co.|Square]]. She stated that the move was done because she was interested in writing "classical-style" music for fantasy [[role-playing game (video games)|role-playing games]]. While working for Capcom, she was in the arcade department and was unable to transfer to the console department to work on their role-playing video game series ''[[Breath of Fire (series)|Breath of Fire]]'', although she did contribute one track to the [[Breath of Fire|first game in the series]].&lt;ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/&gt; Her first project at Square was the score for the [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Live A Live]]'' in 1994. While she was working on the score to ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' the following year, she was asked to join [[Noriko Matsueda]] on the music to the futuristic [[tactical role-playing game|strategy RPG]] ''[[Front Mission]]''. Although she was overworked doing both scores and it was not the genre that she was interested in, she found herself unable to refuse after her first attempt to do so unexpectedly happened in the presence of the president of Square, Tetsuo Mizuno.&lt;ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/&gt; These games were followed by ''[[Tobal No. 1]]'', the last score she worked on with another composer for a decade.&lt;ref name="Yokoprofile"/&gt;

Over the next few years, she composed the soundtrack to several games, including ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'' and ''[[Legend of Mana]]''. Of all her compositions, Shimomura considers the soundtrack to ''Legend of Mana'' the one that best expresses herself and the soundtrack remains Shimomura's personal favourite.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/&gt; ''Parasite Eve'' on the [[PlayStation]] had the first soundtrack by Shimomura that included a vocal song, as it was the first game she had written for running on a console system that had the sound capability for one.&lt;ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/&gt; In 2002 she wrote the score for ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', which she has said is the most "special" soundtrack to her, as well as a turning point in her career; she named the soundtracks to ''Street Fighter II'' and ''Super Mario RPG'' as the other two significant points in her life as a composer.&lt;ref name="GMOint"/&gt;

''Kingdom Hearts'' was wildly successful, shipping more than four million copies worldwide;&lt;ref name="KH4MIL"/&gt; Shimomura's music was frequently cited as one of the highlights of the game, and the title track has been ranked as the fourth-best role-playing game title track of all time.&lt;ref name="KHIGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="titletrack"/&gt; The soundtrack has led to two albums of piano arrangements.&lt;ref name="GMOint"/&gt; ''Kingdom Hearts'' was the last soundtrack that she worked on at Square. After the release of ''Kingdom Hearts'' in 2002, Shimomura left Square for [[maternity leave]], and began work as a freelancer in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga-core.net/special/sp005_4_2.php |title=ゲームミュージック＆アニメ専門店　ga-core – ジーエー・コア – |date=30 May 2009 |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530082303/http://www.ga-core.net/special/sp005_4_2.php |archivedate=May 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has built on the work she did while at Square; since leaving she has composed or is composing music for eleven ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' games and [[Nintendo]]'s [[List of Mario role-playing games#Mario &amp; Luigi series|''Mario &amp; Luigi'' series]]. She has also worked on many other projects, such as ''[[Heroes of Mana]]'' and various arranged albums.&lt;ref name="Yokoprofile"/&gt; In February 2014, Shimomura played piano at a retrospective 25th anniversary concert at Tokyo FM Hall.&lt;ref name="famitsu.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201402/12047970.html|title=『ストII』や『キングダム ハーツ』など下村陽子さん作曲活動25年間が凝縮された記念ライブが開催 - ファミ通.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She performed songs from games such as ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', ''[[Live a Live]]'', and ''[[Street Fighter II]]''. During the ''Beware the Forest's Mushrooms'' performance from ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', Shimomura was joined onstage by fellow game composer [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], who played the [[Irish bouzouki]].&lt;ref name="famitsu.com"/&gt; She most recently composed and produced the majority of the score for ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', which she began writing for in 2006, a decade before the game was released.&lt;ref name="FF15 Soundtrack"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Summers|first1=Nick|title=The 'Final Fantasy XV' soundtrack was a decade in the making|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/07/yoko-shimomura-final-fantasy-xv-soundtrack/|website=Engadget|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After composing soundtracks to over 45 different games, Shimomura has become one of the biggest names in video game music industry, and has been described as "the most famous female video game music composer in the world".&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/yokoshimomura|title=Yoko Shimomura Profile|publisher=Game Music Online|author=Chris Greening|accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GMOint"/&gt; Shimomura's best works compilation album, titled ''[[List of Square Enix compilation albums#Drammatica|Drammatica: The Very Best of Yoko Shimomura]]'', was released in March 2008. The album contains compositions from ''Kingdom Hearts'' and many other games she worked on in full orchestration, with Shimomura stating that she chose music that was popular among fans and well-suited for orchestration, but had never been performed by an orchestra before.&lt;ref name="M4Gint"/&gt; In a 2008 interview with [[Music4Games]] regarding the project, Shimomura commented that with the sheet music generated for the project, she would be interested in pursuing a live performance of ''Drammatica'' for fans if the opportunity arose.&lt;ref name="M4Gint"/&gt; In March 2009, that wish was realized when it was announced that [[Arnie Roth]] would conduct the [[Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra]] at the concert Sinfonia Drammatica in the [[Stockholm Concert Hall]], which would combine music from the album with performances of [[Chris Hülsbeck]]'s Symphonic Shades concert. The concert took place in August 2009.&lt;ref name="SEMOSDreport"/&gt; In March 2007, Shimomura released her first non-video game album, ''Murmur'', an album of vocal songs sung by [[Chata]].&lt;ref name="GMOint"/&gt;

Shimomura's music for ''Kingdom Hearts'' made up one fourth of the music of the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in September 2009, which were produced by the creators of the [[Symphonic Game Music Concerts|Symphonic Game Music Concert]] series and conducted by [[Arnie Roth]].&lt;ref name="SymFant"/&gt; ''Legend of Mana''{{'}}s title theme was also performed by the Australian [[Eminence Symphony Orchestra]] for its classical gaming music concert ''A Night in Fantasia 2007''.&lt;ref name="IGNFantasia"/&gt;

Music from the original soundtrack of ''Legend of Mana'' was arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Two compilation books of music from the series have also been published as ''Seiken Densetsu Best Collection Piano Solo Sheet Music'' first and second editions, with the second including Shimomura's tracks from ''Legend of Mana''. All songs in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible.&lt;ref name="SEMOsheet"/&gt; Additionally, piano sheet music from ''Kingdom Hearts'' and ''Kingdom Hearts II'' has been published as music books by Yamaha Music Media.&lt;ref name="YAMAHA"/&gt;

Shimomura's first dedicated concert performance outside Japan was held at the Salle Cortot in Paris in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huynh|first1=Christopher|title=Wayô Records to collaborate with Yoko Shimomura for concert|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/wayo-records-to-collaborate-with-yoko-shimomura-for-concert/|publisher=Game Music Online|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same month, she performed at the El Plaza Condesa in Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VCON 2015 Features Yoko Shimomura, The OneUps, Metroid Metal, and Royal Corneria Airforce|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/260245/VCON_2015_Features_Yoko_Shimomura_The_OneUps_Metroid_Metaland_Royal_Corneria_Airforce.php|website=Gamasutra|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, some of her music for ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'' was performed by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in [[London]], as well as in [[Boston]], with Shimomura herself performing on piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Martin|title=Square Enix has taken over Abbey Road for a Final Fantasy concert tonight|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-09-07-square-enix-has-taken-over-abbey-road-for-a-final-fantasy-concert-tonight|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FF15 Soundtrack"/&gt;

==Musical style and influences==
Shimomura lists [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], and [[Maurice Ravel]] as some of her influences on her personal website.&lt;ref name="Yokoprofile"/&gt; She has also stated that she has enjoyed "lounge-style jazz" for a long time.&lt;ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/&gt; Despite these influences and her classical training, the diverse musical styles that she has used throughout her career and sometimes in the same soundtrack include "rock, [[electronica]], [[Music of Asia|oriental]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[industrial music|industrial]], pop, symphonic, operatic, [[chiptune]], and more".&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/&gt; She draws inspiration for her songs from things in her life that move her emotionally, which she describes as "a beautiful picture, scenery, tasting something delicious, scents that bring back memories, happy and sad things... Anything that moves my emotion gives me inspiration".&lt;ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/&gt; Shimomura has also stated that she comes up with most of her songs when she is doing something that is "not part of [her] daily routine, like traveling."&lt;ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/&gt; Although her influences are mostly classical, she has said that in her opinion her "style has changed dramatically over the years, though the passion for music stays the same."&lt;ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/&gt; Shimomura has said that she believes that an important part of "the creative process behind music" is to "convey a subtle message, something that comes from your imagination and sticks with the listener, without being overly specific about what it means", rather than only writing simple themes with obvious messages.&lt;ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/&gt; Her favorite track that she has ever composed is "Dearly Beloved" from ''Kingdom Hearts''.&lt;ref name="GMOint"/&gt;
