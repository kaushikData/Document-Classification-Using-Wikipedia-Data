'''64'''  ('''sixty-four''') is the [[natural number]] following [[63 (number)|63]] and preceding [[65 (number)|65]].

==In mathematics==
'''Sixty-four''' is the square of [[8 (number)|8]], the cube of [[4 (number)|4]], and the sixth power of [[2 (number)|2]]. It is the smallest number with exactly seven [[divisor]]s. It is the lowest positive [[power of two]] that is adjacent to neither a [[Mersenne prime]] nor a [[Fermat prime]]. 64 is the sum of [[Euler's totient function]] for the first fourteen integers. It is also a [[dodecagonal number]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A051624|title=Sloane's A051624 : 12-gonal (or dodecagonal) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[centered triangular number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005448|title=Sloane's A005448 : Centered triangular numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 64 is also the first whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.

Since it is possible to find sequences of 64 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member, 64 is an [[Erdős–Woods number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A059756|title=Sloane's A059756 : Erdős-Woods numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In base 10, no integer added up to its own digits yields 64, hence it is a [[self number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A003052|title=Sloane's A003052 : Self numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

64 is a [[superperfect number]]—a number such that [[divisor function|σ]](σ(''n'')) = 2''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A019279|title=Sloane's A019279 : Superperfect numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

64 is the index of [[Graham's number]] in the rapidly growing sequence 3[[Knuth's up-arrow notation|↑↑↑↑]]3, 3 ↑{{sup|3↑↑↑↑3}} 3,…

==Biography==
Hajnal was born on 13 May 1931,&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[http://www.renyi.hu/~ahajnal/hajn2006.pdf Curriculum vitae].&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]].

He received his university diploma (M.Sc. degree) in 1953 from the [[Eötvös Loránd University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.oszk.hu/00700/00775/00029/448-456.html A halmazelmélet huszadik századi "Hajnal A"], M. Streho's interview with A. H., ''[[Magyar Tudomány]]'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; his [[Candidate of Sciences|Candidate]] of Mathematical Science degree (roughly equivalent to Ph.D.) in 1957, under the supervision of [[László Kalmár]],&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=24611|name=Andras Hajnal}}. The 1957 date is from Hajnal's cv; the mathematics genealogy site lists the date of Hajnal's Ph.D. as 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; and his Doctor of Mathematical Science degree in 1962. From 1956 to 1995 he was a faculty member at the [[Eötvös Loránd University]]; in 1994, he moved to Rutgers University to become the director of [[DIMACS]], and he remained there as a professor until his retirement in 2004.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; He became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1982, and directed its [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics|mathematical institute]] from 1982 to 1992.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; He was general secretary of the [[János Bolyai Mathematical Society]] from 1980 to 1990, and president of the society from 1990 to 1994.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; Since 1981, he has been an advisory editor of the journal [[Combinatorica]]. Hajnal was also one of the Honorary Presidents of the European Set Theory Society.

Hajnal was an avid [[chess]] player.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlas-conferences.com/f/a/b/c/58.dir/second.txt The announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724013925/http://atlas-conferences.com/f/a/b/c/58.dir/second.txt |date=2008-07-24 }} for the 2001 conference in honor of Hajnal and Sós calls him “the great chess player”; the conference included a blitz chess tournament in his honor.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hajnal was the father of [[Peter Hajnal]], the co-dean of the [[European College of Liberal Arts]].

==Research and publications==
Hajnal was the author of over 150 publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~ahajnal/hajnalpu.pdf List of publications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716114722/http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~ahajnal/hajnalpu.pdf |date=July 16, 2010 }} from Hajnal's web site.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many co-authors of [[Paul Erdős]], he had the second largest number of joint papers, 56.&lt;ref&gt;[https://files.oakland.edu/users/grossman/enp/Erdos0p.html List of collaborators of Erdős by number of joint papers], from the Erdős number project web site.&lt;/ref&gt;
With Peter Hamburger, he wrote a textbook, ''Set Theory'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-521-59667-X}}). Some of his more well-cited research papers&lt;ref&gt;According to citation counts from Google scholar, retrieved March 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; include
*A paper on [[circuit complexity]] with Maas, Pudlak, [[Mario Szegedy|Szegedy]], and György Turán,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Threshold circuits of bounded depth|first1=A.|last1=Hajnal|first2=W.|last2=Maass|first3=P.|last3=Pudlak|first4=M.|last4=Szegedy|first5=G.|last5=Turán|title=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|Proc. 28th Symp.

*The [[Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem]] on [[equitable coloring]], proving a 1964 conjecture of Erdős:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Proof of a conjecture of P.

Then ''G'' can be [[graph coloring|colored]] with Δ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 colors in such a way that the sizes of the color classes differ by at most one. Several authors have subsequently published simplifications and generalizations of this result.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Catlin | first = Paul A. | journal = Utilitas Mathematica | pages = 163–177 | title = On the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem on disjoint cliques | volume = 17 | year = 1980 | mr = 583138}}; {{citation | last = Fischer | first = Eldar | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0118(199908)31:4&lt;275::AID-JGT2&gt;3.0.CO;2-F | issue = 4 | journal = Journal of Graph Theory | pages = 275–282 | title = Variants of the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem | volume = 31 | year = 1999 | mr = 1698745}}; {{citation | last1 = Kierstead | first1 = H.

*A paper with Erdős and J. W. Moon on graphs that avoid having any ''k''-[[clique (graph theory)|clique]]s. [[Turán's theorem]] characterizes the graphs of this type with the maximum number of edges; Erdős, Hajnal and Moon find a similar characterization of the smallest [[maximal element|maximal]] ''k''-clique-free graphs, showing that they take the form of certain [[split graph]]s. This paper also proves a conjecture of Erdős and [[Tibor Gallai|Gallai]] on the number of edges in a [[critical graph]] for [[dominating set|domination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/2311408|first1=P.|last1=Erdős|author1-link=Paul Erdős|first2=A.|last2=Hajnal|first3=J.

When every finite subgraph has an ordering of this type in which the number of previous neighbors is at most ''k'' (that is, it is [[Degeneracy (graph theory)|''k''-degenerate]]), an infinite graph has a well-ordering with at most 2''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 earlier neighbors per vertex. The paper also proves the nonexistence of infinite graphs with high finite [[Girth (graph theory)|girth]] and sufficiently large infinite chromatic number and the existence of graphs with high odd girth and infinite chromatic number.
Other selected results include:
*In his dissertation&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1007/BF02023921|first=A.|last=Hajnal|title=On a consistency theorem connected with the generalized continuum problem|journal=Acta Math. Acad. Sci. Hung.|volume=12|year=1961|pages=321–376|mr=0150046|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; he introduced the models ''L''(''A'') (see [[Constructible universe#Relative constructibility|relative constructibility]]), and proved that if κ is a [[regular cardinal]] and ''A'' is a subset of κ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, then  ZFC and 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;κ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hold in ''L''(''A''). This can be applied to prove relative consistency results: e.g., if 2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is consistent then so is  2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
*[[Hajnal's set mapping theorem]], the solution to a conjecture of [[Stanisław Ruziewicz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=A.|last=Hajnal|title=Proof of a conjecture of S. Ruziewicz|journal=Fund.

Hajnal shows that ''S'' must have an [[equinumerous]] subset in which no pair of elements ''x'' and ''y'' have ''x'' in ƒ(''y'') or ''y'' in ƒ(''x''). This result greatly extends the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 of [[Kuratowski's free set theorem]], which states that when ƒ maps an uncountable set to finite subsets there exists a pair ''x'', ''y'' neither of which belongs to the image of the other.

Math.'', '''11'''(1968), 115&amp;ndash;124.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of Hausdorff spaces which are hereditarily separable, but not hereditarily Lindelöf, or vice versa. The existence of regular spaces with these properties ([[S-space]] and [[L-space (set theoretic topology)|L-space]]) was much later settled, by [[Stevo Todorčević|Todorcevic]] and  [[Justin Tatch Moore|Moore]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11600">'''Bayesian search theory''' is the application of [[Bayesian statistics]] to the search for lost objects. It has been used several times to find lost sea vessels, for example the [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'']]. It also played a key role in the recovery of the flight recorders in the [[Air France Flight 447]] disaster of 2009.  Currently, it is being used to locate the remains of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/find-mh370-next-job-for-theory-used-to-show-existence-of-god|title = How an Eighteenth-Century Statistician Is Helping to Find MH370|last = AngusWhitley1|first = Angus Whitley|website = Bloomberg.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/mh370/12030483/MH370-search-narrowed-to-hot-spot-as-analysis-finds-plane-did-not-conduct-controlled-landing.html|title = MH370 search narrowed to 'hot-spot' as analysis finds plane did not conduct controlled landing|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-02/mh370-hunters-say-new-analysis-reaffirms-most-likely-wreck-site|title = MH370 Hunters Narrow Down Most Likely Site of Wreckage|last = AngusWhitley1|first = Angus Whitley|website = Bloomberg.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
The usual procedure is as follows:
# Formulate as many reasonable hypotheses as possible about what may have happened to the object.
# For each hypothesis, construct a [[probability density function]] for the location of the object.
# Construct a function giving the probability of actually finding an object in location&amp;nbsp;X when searching there if it really is in location&amp;nbsp;X. In an ocean search, this is usually a function of water depth — in shallow water chances of finding an object are good if the search is in the right place. In deep water chances are reduced.
# Combine the above information coherently to produce an overall probability density map. (Usually this simply means multiplying the two functions together.) This gives the probability of finding the object by looking in location&amp;nbsp;X, for all possible locations&amp;nbsp;X. (This can be visualized as a [[contour map]] of probability.)
# Construct a search path which starts at the point of highest probability and 'scans' over high probability areas, then intermediate probabilities, and finally low probability areas.
# Revise all the probabilities continuously during the search. For example, if the hypotheses for location&amp;nbsp;X imply the likely disintegration of the object and the search at location&amp;nbsp;X has yielded no fragments, then the probability that the object is somewhere around there is greatly reduced (though not usually to zero) while the probabilities of its being at other locations is correspondingly increased. The revision process is done by applying [[Bayes' theorem]].

In other words, first search where it most probably will be found, then search where finding it is less probable, then search where the probability is even less (but still possible due to limitations on fuel, range, water currents, etc.), until insufficient hope of locating the object at acceptable cost remains.

The advantages of the Bayesian method are that all information available is used coherently (i.e., in a "leak-proof" manner) and the method automatically produces estimates of the cost for a given success probability. That is, even before the start of searching, one can say, hypothetically, "there is a 65% chance of finding it in a 5-day search. That probability will rise to 90% after a 10-day search and 97% after 15&amp;nbsp;days" or a similar statement. Thus the economic viability of the search can be estimated before committing resources to a search.

Apart from the [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'']], other vessels located by Bayesian search theory include the [[MV Derbyshire|MV&amp;nbsp;''Derbyshire'']], the largest British vessel ever lost at sea, and the [[SS Central America|SS&amp;nbsp;''Central America'']]. It also proved successful in the search for a lost [[hydrogen bomb]] following the [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]] in Spain, and the recovery in the Atlantic Ocean of the crashed [[Air France Flight 447]].

Bayesian search theory is incorporated into the CASP (Computer Assisted Search Program) mission planning software used by the [[United States Coast Guard]] for [[search and rescue]]. This program was later adapted for inland search by adding terrain and ground cover factors for use by the [[United States Air Force]] and [[Civil Air Patrol]].

==Mathematics==

Suppose a grid square has a probability ''p'' of containing the wreck and that the probability of successfully detecting the wreck if it is there is ''q''. If the square is searched and no wreck is found, then, by Bayes' theorem, the revised probability of the wreck being in the square is given by

: &lt;math&gt;  p' = \frac{p(1-q)}{(1-p)+p(1-q)} = p \frac{1-q}{1-pq} &lt; p.&lt;/math&gt;
For every other grid square, if its prior probability is ''r'', its posterior probability is given by

: &lt;math&gt; r' = r \frac{1}{1- pq} &gt; r. &lt;/math&gt;

===USS ''Scorpion''===

In May 1968, the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[nuclear submarine]] [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'' (SSN-589)]] failed to arrive as expected at her home port of [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. The command officers of the U.S. Navy were nearly convinced that the vessel had been lost off the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]],  but an extensive search there failed to discover the remains of ''Scorpion''.

Then, a Navy deep-water expert, [[John Craven USN|John P. Craven]], suggested that ''Scorpion'' had sunk elsewhere. Craven organised a search southwest of the [[Azores]] based on a controversial approximate triangulation by [[hydrophone]]s. He was allocated only a single ship, [[USNS Mizar (AGOR-11)|''Mizar'']], and he took advice from a firm of consultant mathematicians in order to maximise his resources. A Bayesian search methodology was adopted. Experienced submarine commanders were interviewed to construct hypotheses about what could have caused the loss of ''Scorpion''.

The sea area was divided up into grid squares and a probability assigned to each square, under each of the hypotheses, to give a number of probability grids, one for each hypothesis. These were then added together to produce an overall probability grid. The probability attached to each square was then the probability that the wreck was in that square. A second grid was constructed with probabilities that represented the probability of successfully finding the wreck if that square were to be searched and the wreck were to be actually there. This was a known function of water depth. The result of combining this grid with the previous grid is a grid which gives the probability of finding the wreck in each grid square of the sea if it were to be searched.

At the end of October 1968, the Navy's oceanographic research ship, {{USNS|Mizar|AGOR-11|2}}, located sections of the hull of ''Scorpion'' on the seabed, about {{convert|740|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the [[Azores]],&lt;ref name=pshow&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EyoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 "Strange Devices That Found the Sunken Sub Scorpion."] ''Popular Science'', April 1969, pp. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt; under more than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} of water. This was after the Navy had released sound tapes from its underwater "[[SOSUS]]" listening system, which contained the sounds of the destruction of ''Scorpion''. The court of inquiry was subsequently reconvened and other vessels, including the [[bathyscaphe]] [[Bathyscaphe Trieste II|''Trieste II'']], were dispatched to the scene, collecting many pictures and other data.

Although Craven received much credit for locating the wreckage of ''Scorpion'', Gordon Hamilton, an acoustics expert who pioneered the use of [[hydroacoustics]] to pinpoint Polaris missile splashdown locations, was instrumental in defining a compact "search box" wherein the wreck was ultimately found. Hamilton had established a listening station in the Canary Islands that obtained a clear signal of what some scientists believe was the noise of the vessel's pressure hull imploding as she passed [[crush depth]]. A [[Naval Research Laboratory]] scientist named Chester "Buck" Buchanan, using a towed camera sled of his own design aboard ''Mizar'', finally located ''Scorpion''.&lt;ref name=pshow/&gt; The towed camera sled, which was fabricated by J. L. "Jac" Hamm of Naval Research Laboratory's Engineering Services Division, is housed in the [[National Museum of the United States Navy]]. Buchanan had located the wrecked hull of [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|''Thresher'']] in 1964 using this technique.

==Optimal distribution of search effort==

The classical book on this subject ''The Theory of Optimal Search'' ([[Operations Research Society of America]], 1975) by [[Lawrence D. Stone]] won the 1975 [[Lanchester Prize]] by the American Operations Research Society.

==Searching in boxes==

Assume that a stationary object is hidden in one of n boxes. For each box &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; there are three known parameters: the cost of a single
search at location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;; the probability of finding the object by a single search at location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; if it is at this location, &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;; and the probability that the object is at location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;. A searcher looks for the object. They know the a priori probabilities at the beginning and update them by Bayes’ law after each (unsuccessful) attempt.
The problem of finding the object in minimal expected cost is a classical problem
solved by [[David Blackwell]]. Surprisingly, the optimal policy is easy to describe: at each stage look into the location which maximizes
&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_i a_i}{c_i}&lt;/math&gt;. This is actually a special case of [[Gittins index]].

The '''Bedlam cube''' is a [[solid dissection puzzle]] invented by British puzzle expert Bruce Bedlam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedlampuzzles.com/13reasons.asp] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509092159/http://www.bedlampuzzles.com/13reasons.asp |date=2008-05-09 }}: "Bruce Bedlam the Cubes inventor is putting all his royalty fees into his company 'Stonehenge Limited'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonehenge.tv/intro.html Bruce's Theories] — Stonehenge Ltd website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

The puzzle consists of thirteen [[polycube|polycubic]] pieces: twelve [[pentacube]]s and one [[Polycube|tetracube]]. The objective is to assemble these pieces into a 4 x 4 x 4 cube. There are 19,186 distinct ways of doing so, [[up to]] rotations and reflections.

The Bedlam cube is one unit per side larger than the 3 x 3 x 3 [[Soma cube]], and is much more difficult to solve.

== History ==

Two of the BBC's 'Dragons' from ''[[Dragons' Den (UK)|Dragons' Den]]'', [[Rachel Elnaugh]] and [[Theo Paphitis]], were to invest in the Bedlam cube during the second series. They offered £100,000 for a 15% share of equity in Bedlam Puzzles. Danny Bamping (the entrepreneur behind Bedlam cube) finally chose a bank loan instead of their investment, as seen in the relevant "Where Are They Now" episode of ''Dragons' Den''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lammo.net/dragons-den/267/dragons-den-where-are-they-now-bedlam-cube/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302035534/http://www.lammo.net/dragons-den/267/dragons-den-where-are-they-now-bedlam-cube/ |date=2013-03-02 }}: "A review on where are they now"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Records ==

According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', the official world record for assembling the Bedlam Cube is 11.03 seconds by Danny Bamping on 9 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-5000/fastest-time-to-assemble-a-bedlam-cube-%28crazee-cube%29/ |title=Fastest time to assemble a Bedlam cube (Crazee Cube) |publisher=''Guinness World Records'' |accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blindfolded record is 27.21 seconds by Aleksandr Iljasov on 25 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-5000/fastest-time-to-assemble-a-bedlam-cube-%28crazee-cube%29-blindfolded/ |title=Fastest time to assemble a Bedlam cube (Crazee Cube) blindfolded |publisher=''Guinness World Records'' |accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2153">In [[mathematics]], the '''Dawson&amp;ndash;Gärtner theorem''' is a result in [[large deviations theory]].  Heuristically speaking, the Dawson&amp;ndash;Gärtner theorem allows one to transport a [[large deviation principle]] on a “smaller” [[topological space]] to a “larger” one.

==Statement of the theorem==
Let (''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''j''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt; be a [[projective system]] of [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff topological spaces]] with maps ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Let ''X'' be the projective limit (also known as the inverse limit) of the system (''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;X = \varprojlim_{j \in J} Y_{j} = \left\{ \left. y = (y_{j})_{j \in J} \in Y = \prod_{j \in J} Y_{j} \right| i &lt; j \implies y_{i} = p_{ij} (y_{j}) \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let (''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a family of [[probability measure]]s on ''X''.  Assume that, for each ''j''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''J'', the [[push-forward measure]]s (''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''∗&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; on ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy the large deviation principle with [[good rate function]] ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{+∞}.  Then the family (''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies the large deviation principle on ''X'' with good rate function ''I''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{+∞} given by

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10259">In [[mathematics]], the '''equilateral dimension''' of a [[metric space]] is the maximum number of points that are all at equal distances from each other.&lt;ref name="DD09"&gt;{{harvtxt|Deza|Deza|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equilateral dimension has also been called "[[Metric dimension (disambiguation)|metric dimension]]", but the term "metric dimension" also has many other inequivalent usages.&lt;ref name="DD09"/&gt; The equilateral dimension of a ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}}, and the equilateral dimension of a ''d''-dimensional [[vector space]] with the [[Chebyshev distance]] (L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; norm) is 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the equilateral dimension of a space with the [[Taxicab geometry|Manhattan distance]] (L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norm) is not known; '''Kusner's conjecture''', named after [[Robert B. Kusner]], states that it is exactly 2''d''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Guy|1983}}; {{harvtxt|Koolen|Laurent|Schrijver|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lebesgue spaces==
The equilateral dimension has been particularly studied for [[Lp space|Lebesgue spaces]], finite-dimensional [[normed vector space]]s with the L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm
:&lt;math&gt;\ \|x\|_p=\left(|x_1|^p+|x_2|^p+\cdots+|x_d|^p\right)^{1/p}.&lt;/math&gt;

The equilateral dimension of L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces of dimension ''d'' behaves differently depending on the value of ''p'':
*For ''p'' = 1, the L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm gives rise to [[Taxicab geometry|Manhattan distance]]. In this case, it is possible to find 2''d'' equidistant points, the vertices of an axis-aligned [[cross polytope]]. The equilateral dimension is known to be exactly 2''d'' for {{nowrap|''d'' ≤ 4}},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bandelt|Chepoi|Laurent|1998}}; {{harvtxt|Koolen|Laurent|Schrijver|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and to be upper bounded by {{nowrap|O(''d'' log ''d'')}} for any ''d''.&lt;ref name="AP03"&gt;{{harvtxt|Alon|Pudlák|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert B. Kusner suggested in 1983 that the equilateral dimension for this case should be exactly 2''d'';&lt;ref name="Guy83"/&gt; this suggestion (together with a related suggestion for the equilateral dimension when ''p'' &gt; 2) has come to be known as '''Kusner's conjecture'''.
*For 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 2, the equilateral dimension is at least {{nowrap|(1 + ε)''d''}} where ε is a constant that depends on ''p''.&lt;ref name="S04"&gt;{{harvtxt|Swanepoel|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*For ''p'' = 2, the L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm is the familiar [[Euclidean distance]]. The equilateral dimension of ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}}: the {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}} vertices of an [[equilateral triangle]], [[regular tetrahedron]], or higher-dimensional regular [[simplex]] form an equilateral set, and every equilateral set must have this form.&lt;ref name="Guy83"&gt;{{harvtxt|Guy|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*For 2 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞, the equilateral dimension is at least {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}}: for instance the ''d'' [[basis vector]]s of the vector space together with another vector of the form {{nowrap|(&amp;minus;''x'', &amp;minus;''x'', ...)}} for a suitable choice of ''x'' form an equilateral set. Kusner's conjecture states that in these cases the equilateral dimension is exactly {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}}. Kusner's conjecture has been proven for the special case that {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 4}}.&lt;ref name="S04"/&gt; When ''p'' is an odd integer the equilateral dimension is upper bounded by {{nowrap|O(''d'' log ''d'')}}.&lt;ref name="AP03"/&gt;
*For ''p'' = ∞ (the limiting case of the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm for finite values of ''p'', in the limit as ''p'' grows to infinity) the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm becomes the [[Chebyshev distance]], the maximum absolute value of the differences of the coordinates. For a ''d''-dimensional vector space with the Chebyshev distance, the equilateral dimension is 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;: the 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; vertices of an axis-aligned [[hypercube]] are at equal distances from each other, and no larger equilateral set is possible.&lt;ref name="Guy83"/&gt;

==Normed vector spaces==
Equilateral dimension has also been considered for [[normed vector space]]s with norms other than the [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;]] norms. The problem of determining the equilateral dimension for a given norm is closely related to the [[kissing number problem]]: the kissing number in a normed space is the maximum number of disjoint translates of a unit ball that can all touch a single central ball, whereas the equilateral dimension is the maximum number of disjoint translates that can all touch each other.

For a normed vector space of dimension ''d'', the equilateral dimension is at most 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;; that is, the L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; norm has the highest equilateral dimension among all normed spaces.&lt;ref name="Petty71"&gt;{{harvtxt|Petty|1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Petty|1971}} asked whether every normed vector space of dimension ''d'' has equilateral dimension at least {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}}, but this remains unknown. There exist normed spaces in any dimension for which certain sets of four equilateral points cannot be extended to any larger equilateral set&lt;ref name="Petty71"/&gt; but these spaces may have larger equilateral sets that do not include these four points. For norms that are sufficiently close in [[Banach–Mazur compactum|Banach–Mazur distance]] to an L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm, Petty's question has a positive answer: the equilateral dimension is at least {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}}.&lt;ref name="sv08"&gt;{{harvtxt|Swanepoel|Villa|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not possible for high-dimensional spaces to have bounded equilateral dimension: for any integer ''k'', all normed vector spaces of sufficiently high dimension have equilateral dimension at least ''k''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Braß|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Swanepoel|Villa|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically, according to a variation of [[Dvoretzky's theorem]] by {{harvtxt|Alon|Milman|1983}}, every ''d''-dimensional normed space has a ''k''-dimensional subspace that is close either to a Euclidean space or to a Chebyshev space, where
:&lt;math&gt;k\ge\exp(c\sqrt{\log d})&lt;/math&gt;
for some constant ''c''. Because it is close to a Lebesgue space, this subspace and therefore also the whole space contains an equilateral set of at least ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 points. Therefore, the same superlogarithmic dependence on ''d'' holds for the lower bound on the equilateral dimension of ''d''-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="sv08"/&gt;

==Riemannian manifolds==
For any ''d''-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] the equilateral dimension is at least {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}}.&lt;ref name="Guy83"/&gt; For a ''d''-dimensional [[sphere]], the equilateral dimension is {{nowrap|''d'' + 2}}, the same as for a Euclidean space of one higher dimension into which the sphere can be embedded.&lt;ref name="Guy83"/&gt; At the same time as he posed Kusner's conjecture, Kusner asked whether there exist Riemannian metrics with bounded dimension as a manifold but arbitrarily high equilateral dimension.&lt;ref name="Guy83"/&gt;

An '''existential graph''' is a type of [[diagram]]matic or visual notation for logical expressions, proposed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who wrote on [[logical graph|graphical logic]] as early as 1882,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., "[On Junctures and Fractures in Logic]" (editors' title for MS 427 (the new numbering system), Fall–Winter 1882), and "Letter, Peirce to O. H. Mitchell" (L 294, 21 December 1882), ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce]]'', v. 4, "Junctures" on pp. 391–393 (Google [https://books.google.com/books?id=E7ZUnx3FqrcC&amp;q=MS+427 preview]) and the letter on pp. 394–399 (Google [https://books.google.com/books?id=E7ZUnx3FqrcC&amp;q=L+294 preview]). See [[John F. Sowa|Sowa, John F.]] (1997), "Matching Logical Structure to Linguistic Structure", ''Studies in the Logic of Charles Sanders Peirce'', Nathan Houser, Don D. Roberts, and James Van Evra, editors, Bloomington and Indianopolis: Indiana University Press, pp. 418–444, see 420, 425, 426, 428.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to develop the method until his death in 1914.

==The graphs==
Peirce proposed three systems of existential graphs:
* ''alpha'', [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to [[sentential logic]] and the [[two-element Boolean algebra]];
* ''beta'', isomorphic to [[first-order logic]] with identity, with all formulas closed;
* ''gamma'', (nearly) isomorphic to [[normal modal logic]].
''Alpha'' nests in ''beta'' and ''gamma''. ''Beta'' does not nest in ''gamma'', quantified modal logic being more general than put forth by Peirce.

===Alpha===
[[Image:PeirceAlphaGraphs.svg|thumb|300px|Alpha Graphs]]

The [[syntax]] is:
*The blank page;
*Single letters or phrases written anywhere on the page;
*Any graph may be enclosed by a [[simple closed curve]] called a ''cut'' or ''sep''. A cut can be empty. Cuts can nest and concatenate at will, but must never intersect.
Any well-formed part of a graph is a '''subgraph'''.

The [[semantics]] are:
*The blank page denotes '''Truth''';
*Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs may be '''True''' or '''False''';
*To enclose a subgraph with a cut is equivalent to logical [[negation]] or Boolean [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]]. Hence an empty cut denotes '''False''';
*All subgraphs within a given cut are tacitly [[conjunction (logic)|conjoined]].
Hence the ''alpha'' graphs are a minimalist notation for [[sentential logic]], grounded in the expressive adequacy of '''And''' and '''Not'''. The ''alpha'' graphs constitute a radical simplification of the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] and the [[connective (logic)|truth functors]].

The ''depth'' of an object is the number of cuts that enclose it.

''Rules of inference'':
*Insertion - Any subgraph may be inserted into an odd numbered depth.
*Erasure - Any subgraph in an even numbered depth may be erased.

''Rules of equivalence'':
*Double cut - A pair of cuts with nothing between them may be drawn around any subgraph. Likewise two nested cuts with nothing between them may be erased. This rule is equivalent to Boolean involution.
*Iteration/Deiteration – To understand this rule, it is best to view a graph as a [[tree structure]] having [[Node (computer science)|node]]s and [[tree structure|ancestors]]. Any subgraph ''P'' in node ''n'' may be copied into any node depending on ''n''. Likewise, any subgraph ''P'' in node ''n'' may be erased if there exists a copy of ''P'' in some node ancestral to ''n'' (i.e., some node on which ''n'' depends). For an equivalent rule in an algebraic context, see '''C2''' in [[Laws of form]].

A proof manipulates a graph by a series of steps, with each step justified by one of the above rules. If a graph can be reduced by steps to the blank page or an empty cut, it is what is now called a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] (or the complement thereof). Graphs that cannot be simplified beyond a certain point are analogues of the [[satisfiable]] [[formula]]s of [[first-order logic]].

===Beta===
Peirce notated [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]s using intuitive English phrases; the standard notation of contemporary logic, capital Latin letters, may also be employed. A dot asserts the existence of some individual in the [[domain of discourse]]. Multiple instances of the same object are linked by a line, called the "line of identity". There are no literal [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] or [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]]s in the sense of [[first-order logic]]. A line of identity connecting two or more predicates can be read as asserting that the predicates share a common variable. The presence of lines of identity requires modifying the ''alpha'' rules of Equivalence.

The beta graphs can be read as a system in which all formula are to be taken as closed, because all variables are implicitly quantified. If the "shallowest" part of a line of identity has even (odd) depth, the associated variable is tacitly [[existential quantifier|existentially]] ([[universal quantifier|universally]]) quantified. 

Zeman&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jzeman/ Zeman (1964)]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to note that the ''beta'' graphs are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to [[first-order logic]] with [[First-order logic#Equality and its axioms|equality]] (also see Zeman 1967). However, the secondary literature, especially Roberts (1973) and Shin (2002), does not agree on just how this is so. Peirce's writings do not address this question, because first-order logic was first clearly articulated only some years after his death, in the 1928 first edition of [[David Hilbert]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]]'s ''[[Principles of Mathematical Logic]]''.

===Gamma===
Add to the syntax of ''alpha'' a second kind of [[simple closed curve]], written using a dashed rather than a solid line. Peirce proposed rules for this second style of cut, which can be read as the primitive [[unary operation|unary operator]] of [[modal logic]].

[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jzeman/ Zeman (1964)] was the first to note that straightforward emendations of the ''gamma'' graph rules yield the well-known [[modal logic|modal logics S4]] and [[S5 (modal logic)|S5]]. Hence the ''gamma'' graphs can be read as a peculiar form of [[normal modal logic]]. This finding of Zeman's has gone unremarked to this day, but is nonetheless included here as a point of interest.

==Peirce's role==
The existential graphs are a curious offspring of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] the [[logic]]ian/mathematician with Peirce the founder of a major strand of [[semiotics]]. Peirce's graphical logic is but one of his many accomplishments in logic and mathematics. In a series of papers beginning in 1867, and culminating with his classic paper in the 1885 ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'', Peirce developed much of the [[two-element Boolean algebra]], [[propositional logic|propositional calculus]], [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] and the [[first-order logic|predicate calculus]], and some rudimentary [[set theory]]. [[model theory|Model theorists]] consider Peirce the first of their kind. He also extended De Morgan's [[relation algebra]]. He stopped short of [[metalogic]] (which eluded even ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'').

But Peirce's evolving [[semiotic]] theory led him to doubt the value of logic formulated using conventional linear notation, and to prefer that logic and mathematics be notated in two (or even three) dimensions. His work went beyond [[Euler diagram|Euler's diagrams]] and [[John Venn|Venn]]'s 1880 [[Venn diagram|revision]] thereof. [[Frege]]'s 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' also employed a two-dimensional notation for logic, but one very different from Peirce's.

Peirce's first published paper on graphical logic (reprinted in Vol. 3 of his ''Collected Papers'') proposed a system dual (in effect) to the ''alpha'' existential graphs, called the [[entitative graph]]s. He very soon abandoned this formalism in favor of the existential graphs. The graphical logic went unremarked during his lifetime, and was invariably denigrated or ignored after his death, until the Ph.D. theses by Roberts (1964) and [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jzeman/ Zeman (1964)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3867">In [[quantum computing]], the '''Gottesman&amp;ndash;Knill theorem''' is a theoretical result by [[Daniel Gottesman]] and Emanuel Knill that states that stabilizer circuits, circuits that only consist of gates from the [[Centralizer and normalizer|normalizer]] of the qubit [[Pauli group]], also called Clifford group, can be perfectly simulated in polynomial time on a probabilistic classical computer. The Clifford group can be [[Generating set of a group|generated]] solely by using CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates &lt;ref name="aaronson2004improved"&gt;{{cite journal

, therefore [[Group action|stabilizer]] circuits can be constructed using only these gates. 

The reason for the speed up of quantum computers is not yet fully understood. The theorem proves that, for all quantum algorithms with a speed up that relies on entanglement which can be achieved with a [[Controlled NOT gate|CNOT]] and a [[Hadamard]] gate to produce entangled states, this kind of entanglement alone does not give any computing advantage.

There exists a more efficient simulation of stabilizer circuits than the construction of the original publication&lt;ref name="aaronson2004improved"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with an implementation&lt;ref name="https://www.scottaaronson.com/chp/"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aaronson|first1=Scott|last2=Gottesman|first2=Daniel|authorlink1=Scott Aaronson|authorlink2=Daniel Gottesman|title=CHP: CNOT-Hadamard-Phase|url=https://www.scottaaronson.com/chp/|website=scottaaronson|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Formal statement==
Theorem:  A quantum circuit using only the following elements can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer:
# Preparation of [[qubit]]s in computational basis states,
# Quantum gates from the Clifford group ([[Hadamard gate]]s, [[controlled NOT gate]]s, Phase Gate), and
# Measurements in the computational basis.

The Gottesman&amp;ndash;Knill theorem shows that even some highly [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] states can be simulated efficiently. Several important types of quantum algorithms use only Clifford gates, most importantly the standard algorithms for entanglement purification and for quantum error correction. From a practical point of view, stabilizer circuits have been simulated in O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') time using the [[graph state]] formalism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18676">The '''gravity model of international trade''' in [[international economics]] is a model that, in its traditional form, predicts bilateral [[trade flows]] based on the economic sizes (often using [[GDP]] measurements) and distance between two units.

The model was first introduced in economics world by [[Walter Isard]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Isard|first=Walter|title=Location Theory and Trade Theory: Short-Run Analysis|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=68 |issue=2 |page=305|year=May 1954|doi=10.2307/1884452}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic model for trade between two countries (''i'' and ''j'') takes the form of
: &lt;math&gt;F_{ij} = G * M_i * M_j /{D_{ij}} &lt;/math&gt;
In this formula G is the constant, F stands for trade flow, D stands for the distance and M stands for the economic dimensions of the countries that are being measured. The equation can be changed into a linear form for the purpose of econometric analyses by employing logarithms. The model has been used by economists to analyse the determinants of bilateral trade flows such as common borders, common languages, common legal systems, common currencies, common colonial legacies, and it has been used to test the effectiveness of trade agreements and organizations such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) (Head and Mayer 2014). The model has also been used in international relations to evaluate the impact of treaties and alliances on trade (Head and Mayer).

The model has also been applied to other bilateral flow data (also 'dyadic' data) such as [[Data migration|migration]], traffic, [[remittances]] and [[foreign direct investment]].

== Theoretical justifications and research ==
The model has been an empirical success in that it accurately predicts trade flows between countries for many goods and services, but for a long time some scholars believed that there was no theoretical justification for the gravity equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deardorff|first=Alan|title=Determinants of Bilateral Trade: Does Gravity Work in a Neoclassical World?|journal=The Regionalization of the World Economy|year=1998|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c7818.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a gravity relationship can arise in almost any trade model that includes [[trade costs]] that increase with distance.

The gravity model estimates the pattern of international trade. While the model’s basic form consists of factors that have more to do with geography and spatiality, the gravity model has been used to test hypotheses rooted in purer economic theories of trade as well. One such theory predicts that trade will be based on relative factor abundances. One of the common relative factor abundance models is the [[Heckscher–Ohlin model]]. This theory would predict that trade patterns would be based on relative [[factor of production|factor]] abundance. Those countries with a relative abundance of one factor would be expected to produce goods that require a relatively large amount of that factor in their production. While a generally accepted theory of trade, many economists in the Chicago School believed that the Heckscher–Ohlin model alone was sufficient to describe all trade, while [[Bertil Ohlin]] himself argued that in fact the world is more complicated. Investigations into real-world trading patterns have produced a number of results that do not match the expectations of comparative advantage theories. Notably, a study by [[Wassily Leontief]] found that the [[United States]], the most capital-endowed country in the world, actually [[exports]] more in labor-intensive industries. Comparative advantage in factor endowments would suggest the opposite would occur. Other theories of trade and explanations for this relationship were proposed in order to explain the discrepancy between Leontief’s empirical findings and economic theory. The problem has become known as the [[Leontief paradox]].

An alternative theory, first proposed by [[Staffan Linder]], predicts that patterns of trade will be determined by the aggregated preferences for goods within countries. Those countries with similar preferences would be expected to develop similar industries. With continued similar demand, these countries would continue to trade back and forth in [[differentiation (marketing)|differentiated]] but similar goods since both demand and produce similar products. For instance, both [[Economy of Germany|Germany]] and the [[Economy of United States|United States]] are industrialized countries with a high preference for automobiles. Both countries have automobile industries, and both trade cars. The empirical validity of the [[Linder hypothesis]] is somewhat unclear. Several studies have found a significant impact of the Linder effect, but others have had weaker results. Studies that do not support Linder have only counted countries that actually trade; they do not input zero values for the dyads where trade could happen but does not. This has been cited as a possible explanation for their findings. Also, Linder never presented a formal model for his theory, so different studies have tested his hypothesis in different ways.

[[Elhanan Helpman]] and [[Paul Krugman]] asserted that the theory behind comparative advantage does not predict the relationships in the gravity model. Using the gravity model, countries with similar levels of income have been shown to trade more. Helpman and Krugman see this as evidence that these countries are trading in differentiated goods because of their similarities. This casts some doubt about the impact Heckscher–Ohlin has on the real world. [[Jeffrey Frankel]] sees the Helpman–Krugman setup here as distinct from Linder’s proposal. However, he does say Helpman–Krugman is different from the usual interpretation of Linder, but, since Linder made no clear model, the association between the two should not be completely discounted. [[Alan Deardorff]] adds the possibility, that, while not immediately apparent, the basic gravity model can be derived from Heckscher–Ohlin as well as the Linder and Helpman–Krugman hypotheses. Deardorff concludes that, considering how many models can be tied to the gravity model equation, it is not useful for evaluating the empirical validity of theories.

Bridging economic theory with empirical tests, [[James E. Anderson|James Anderson]] and [[Jeffrey Bergstrand]] develop econometric models, grounded in the theories of differentiated goods, which measure the gains from trade liberalizations and the magnitude of the border barriers on trade (see [[Home bias in trade puzzle]]). A recent synthesis of empirical research using the gravity equations, however, shows that the effect of border barriers on trade is relatively modest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Do Borders Really Slash Trade? A Meta-Analysis|journal=The IMF Economic Review|year=2016|url=https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41308-016-0001-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding to the problem of bridging economic theory with empirical results, some economists have pointed to the possibility of [[intra-industry trade]] not as the result of differentiated goods, but because of “[[reciprocal dumping]].” In these models, the countries involved are said to have imperfect competition and segmented markets in homogeneous goods, which leads to intra-industry trade as firms in imperfect competition seek to expand their markets to other countries and trade goods that are not differentiated yet for which they do not have a comparative advantage, since there is no specialization. This model of trade is consistent with the gravity model as it would predict that trade depends on country size.

The reciprocal dumping model has held up to some empirical testing, suggesting that the specialization and differentiated goods models for the gravity equation might not fully explain the gravity equation. Feenstra, Markusen, and Rose (2001) provided evidence for reciprocal dumping by assessing the ''[[home market effect]]'' in separate gravity equations for differentiated and homogeneous goods. The home market effect showed a relationship in the gravity estimation for differentiated goods, but showed the inverse relationship for homogeneous goods. The authors show that this result matches the theoretical predictions of reciprocal dumping playing a role in homogeneous markets.

Past research using the gravity model has also sought to evaluate the impact of various variables in addition to the basic gravity equation. Among these, price level and exchange rate variables have been shown to have a relationship in the gravity model that accounts for a significant amount of the variance not explained by the basic gravity equation. According to empirical results on price level, the effect of price level varies according to the relationship being examined. For instance, if exports are being examined, a relatively high price level on the part of the importer would be expected to increase trade with that country. A non-linear system of equations are used by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) to account for the endogenous change in these price terms from trade liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = J. | last2 = van Wincoop | first2 = E. | year = 2003 | title = Gravity with Gravitas: A Solution to the Border Puzzle | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/aer/2003/00000093/00000001/art00009 | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 93| issue = | pages = 170–192| doi=10.1257/000282803321455214}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more simple method is to use a first order log-linearization of this system of equations (Baier and Bergstrand (2009)), or exporter-country-year and importer-country-year dummy variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baier | first1 = SL | last2 = Bergstrand | first2 = JH | year = 2009 | title = Bonus Vetus OLS:"A Simple Method for Approximating International Trade-Cost Effects Using the Gravity Equation | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022199608001062 | journal = Journal of International Economics | volume =  77| issue = | pages =  77–85| doi=10.1016/j.jinteco.2008.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For counterfactual analysis, however, one would still need to account for the change in world prices.

== Econometric estimation of gravity equations ==

Since the gravity model for trade does not hold exactly, in [[econometric]] applications it is customary to specify

:&lt;math&gt;F_{ij} = G \frac{ M_i^{\beta_1} M_j^{\beta_2} }{ D_{ij}^{\beta_3}} \eta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents volume of trade from country &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to country &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_j&lt;/math&gt; typically represent the GDPs for countries &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the distance between the two countries, and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; represents an error term with expectation equal to 1.

The traditional approach to estimating this equation consists in taking logs of both sides, leading to a log-log model of the form (note: constant G becomes part of &lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\ln (F_{ij}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln (M_i) + \beta_2 \ln (M_j) - \beta_3 \ln (D_{ij}) + \varepsilon_{ij}.&lt;/math&gt;

However, this approach has two major problems. First, it obviously cannot be used when there are observations for which &lt;math&gt;F_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to zero. Second, iSantos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) argued that estimating the log-linearized equation by [[least squares]] (OLS) can lead to significant biases. As an alternative, these authors have suggested that the model should be estimated in its multiplicative form, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; F_{ij} = \exp [ \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln (M_i) + \beta_2 \ln (M_j) - \beta_3 \ln (D_{ij})] \eta_{ij},&lt;/math&gt;

using a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) estimator usually used for count data. One of the authors' more surprising findings was that, when controlling for sharing a common language, having past colonial ties does not increase trade. This is despite the fact that simpler methods, such as taking simple averages of trade shares of countries with and without former colonial ties suggest that countries with former colonial ties continue to trade more. Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) did not explain where their result came from and even failed to realize their results were highly anomalous. Martin and Pham (2008) argued that using PPML on gravity severely biases estimates when zero trade flows are frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9453/1/MPRA_paper_9453.pdf|title=Martin, William and Cong S. Pham, "Estimating the Gravity Model When Zero Trade Flows are Frequent." Working Paper.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their results were challenged by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2011), who argued that the simulation results of Martin and Pham (2008) are based on misspecified models and showed that the PPML estimator performs well even when the proportions of zeros is very large.

In applied work, the model is often extended by including variables to account for language relationships, tariffs, contiguity, access to sea, colonial history, and exchange rate regimes. Yet the estimation of structural gravity, based on Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), requires the inclusion of importer and exporter fixed effects, thus limiting the gravity analysis to bilateral trade costs (Baldwin and Taglioni 2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3582">A '''highly totient number''' ''k'' is an integer that has more solutions to the equation φ(''x'') = ''k'', where φ is [[Euler's totient function]], than any integer below it. The first few highly totient numbers are

[[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[8 (number)|8]], [[12 (number)|12]], [[24 (number)|24]], [[48 (number)|48]], [[72 (number)|72]], [[144 (number)|144]], [[240 (number)|240]], 432, 480, 576, [[720 (number)|720]], 1152, 1440 {{OEIS|id=A097942}}, with 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 17, 21, 31, 34, 37, 38, 49, 54, and 72 totient solutions respectively. The sequence of highly totient numbers is a subset of the sequence of smallest number ''k'' with exactly ''n'' solutions to φ(''x'') = ''k''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A097942|2=Highly totient numbers: each number k on this list has more solutions to the equation phi(x) = k than any preceding k (where phi is Euler's totient function, A000010)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The totient of a number ''x'', with prime factorization &lt;math&gt;x=\prod_i p_i^{e_i}&lt;/math&gt;, is the product:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x)=\prod_i (p_i-1)p_i^{e_i-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, a highly totient number is a number that has more ways of being expressed as a product of this form than does any smaller number.

The concept is somewhat analogous to that of [[highly composite number]]s, and in the same way that 1 is the only odd highly composite number, it is also the only odd highly totient number (indeed, the only odd number to not be a [[nontotient]]). And just as there are infinitely many highly composite numbers, there are also infinitely many highly totient numbers, though the highly totient numbers get tougher to find the higher one goes, since calculating the totient function involves [[Integer factorization|factorization]] into [[prime number|primes]], something that becomes extremely difficult as the numbers get larger.

==Example==
There are five numbers (15, 16, 20, 24, and 30) whose totient number is 8.  No positive integer smaller than 8 has as many such numbers, so 8 is highly totient.

== Navigation prior to the compass ==
{{See also|Polynesian navigation}}
Prior to the introduction of the compass, geographical position and direction at sea were primarily determined by the sighting of landmarks, supplemented with the observation of the position of celestial bodies.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2014|title=Once Upon a Time, the Compass|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=8|issue=2|pages=60-63|doi=10.1109/MIE.2014.2316044|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects that have been understood as having been used for navigation by measuring the angles between celestial objects, were discovered in the Indus Valley site of Lothal.&lt;ref&gt;http://drs.nio.org/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/3082/J_Mar_Archaeol_3_61.pdf?sequence=2&lt;/ref&gt;  On cloudy days, the Vikings may have used [[cordierite]] or some other [[birefringence|birefringent crystal]] to determine the sun's direction and [[Horizontal coordinate system|elevation]] from the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of daylight; their astronomical knowledge was sufficient to let them use this information to determine their proper heading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Gábor Horváth|year= 2011|title= On the trail of Vikings with polarized skylight|journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume= 366 |pages= 772–782 |doi= 10.1098/rstb.2010.0194 |issue= 1565 |display-authors= 1 |last2= Barta |first2= A. |last3= Pomozi |first3= I. |last4= Suhai |first4= B. |last5= Hegedus |first5= R. |last6= Akesson |first6= S. |last7= Meyer-Rochow |first7= B. |last8= Wehner |first8= R.|pmc= 3049005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The invention of the compass made it possible to determine a heading when the sky was overcast or foggy, and when landmarks were not in sight.

== Geomancy and Feng Shui ==

The compass was invented in China during the [[Han Dynasty]] between the 2nd century BC and 1st century AD, where it was called the "south-governor" (''sīnán'' {{lang|zh|司南}}).&lt;ref name=merrill /&gt; The magnetic compass was not, at first, used for navigation, but for [[geomancy]] and [[fortune-telling]] by the [[China|Chinese]]. The earliest [[China|Chinese]] [[magnetic]] compasses were possibly used to order and harmonize buildings in accordance with the geomantic principles of ''[[feng shui]]''. These early compasses were made with [[lodestone]], a form of the mineral [[magnetite]] that is a naturally occurring [[magnet]] and aligns itself with the Earth’s magnetic field.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt; People in ancient China discovered that if a lodestone was suspended so it could turn freely, it would always point toward the magnetic poles. Early compasses were used to choose areas suitable for building houses, growing crops, and to search for rare gems. Compasses were later adapted for navigation during the [[Song Dynasty]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="cambridge1" /&gt;

Based on Krotser and Coe's discovery of an [[Olmec]] [[hematite]] artifact in [[Mesoamerica]], [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to 1400–1000 BC, astronomer John Carlson has hypothesized that the Olmec might have used the geomagnetic [[lodestone]] earlier than 1000 BC for [[geomancy]], a method of [[divination]], which if proven true, predates the Chinese use of magnetism for [[feng shui]] by a millennium.&lt;ref name="John B. Carlson 1975"&gt;John B. Carlson, "Lodestone Compass: Chinese or Olmec Primacy? Multidisciplinary Analysis of an Olmec Hematite Artifact from San Lorenzo, Veracruz, Mexico", ''Science'', New Series, Vol. 189, No. 4205 (5 September 1975), pp. 753-760 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson speculates that the Olmecs used similar artifacts as a directional device for astronomical or [[geomancy|geomantic]] purposes but does not suggest navigational usage. The artifact is part of a polished [[hematite]] bar with a groove at one end, possibly used for sighting. Carlson's claims have been disputed by other scientific researchers, who have suggested that the artifact is actually a constituent piece of a decorative ornament and not a purposely built compass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph |author2=Lu Gwei-Djen|title=Trans-Pacific Echoes and Resonances: Listening Once Again |publisher=World Scientific |year=1985 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other hematite or magnetite artifacts have been found at pre-Columbian archaeological sites in Mexico and Guatemala.&lt;ref name="A.

== Early navigational compass ==
A number of early cultures used [[lodestone]]s, suspended so they could turn, as magnetic compasses for navigation. Early mechanical compasses are referenced in written records of the [[China|Chinese]], who began using it for navigation sometime between the 9th and 11th century, "some time before 1050, possibly as early as 850."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|title=The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 3|year=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=176|isbn=978-0-521-31560-9|quote=the introduction of the mariner's compass on Chinese ships some time before 1050, possibly as early as 850}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt; At present, according to Kreutz, scholarly consensus is that the Chinese invention used in navigation pre-dates the first European mention of a compass by 150 years.&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 367"&gt;Kreutz, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded appearance of the use of the compass in Europe (1190)&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 368" /&gt; is earlier than in the Muslim world (1232),&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 370"&gt;Kreutz, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 369"&gt;Kreutz, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; as a description of a magnetized needle and its use among sailors occurs in [[Alexander Neckam]]'s ''De naturis rerum'' (On the Natures of Things), written in 1190.&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 368"&gt;Kreutz, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lanza 2006 255"&gt;{{cite book | last= Lanza | first=Roberto | last2=Meloni | first2=Antonio | title=The earth's magnetism an introduction for geologists | year=2006 | publisher=Springer | location=Berlin | page=255 | isbn=978-3-540-27979-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, there are questions over diffusion. Some historians suggest that the Arabs introduced the compass from China to Europe.&lt;ref name="needhamb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|title=Cambridge University Press|publisher=University of California Press|pages=173|quote=Thus the possibility presents itself that... it may have formed part of one of those transmissions from Asia which we find in so many fields of applied science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mceachren"&gt;{{cite book|last=McEachren|first=Justin W.|title=General Science Quarterly, Volumes 5-6|publisher=University of California Press|pages=337|quote=From the Chinese, the Arabs in all probability learned to use the magnetic needle, and in this round-about fashion it was brought to Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggested the compass was transmitted from China to Europe and the Muslim world via the Indian Ocean,&lt;ref name=Bentley&gt;{{cite book|last=Bentley|first= Jerry|title=Traditions &amp; Encounters: A Global Perspective on the Past |pages=637}}&lt;/ref&gt; or was brought by the crusaders to Europe from China.&lt;ref name="Derek"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131101154257/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30001/30001-h/30001-h.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some scholars proposed an independent European invention of the compass:&lt;ref&gt;"Principles of the Magnetic Methods in Geophysics", Alex A.

There is disagreement as to exactly when the compass was invented. These are noteworthy [[History of China|Chinese]] literary references in evidence for its antiquity:
* The magnetic compass was first invented as a device for [[divination]] as early as the [[History of Science and Technology in China|Chinese]] [[Han Dynasty]] (since about 206 BC).&lt;ref name="cambridge1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=merrill&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrill|first=Ronald T.|title=The Earth's magnetic field: Its history, origin and planetary perspective|year=1983|publisher=Academic press|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-12-491242-7|page=1|edition=2nd printing|author2=McElhinny, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Li Shu-hua, p. 176"&gt;Li Shu-hua, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; The compass was used in [[Song Dynasty]] China by the military for [[Land navigation (military)|navigational orienteering]] by 1040–44,&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 367" /&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 252"&gt;Needham, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Li Shu-hua, p. 182f"&gt;Li Shu-hua, p. 182f.&lt;/ref&gt; and was used for maritime navigation by 1111 to 1117.&lt;ref name="Ronan"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Colin A. Ronan|author2=Joseph Needham|title=The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjRAiqGSJ50C&amp;pg=PA27|date=25 July 1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31560-9|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The earliest [[Chinese literature]] reference to '''magnetism''' lies in the 4th century BC writings of [[Guiguzi|Wang Xu]] (鬼谷子): "The lodestone attracts iron."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131117175834/http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/7209/pg7209.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The book also notes that the people of the state of Zheng always knew their position by means of a "south-pointer"; some authors suggest that this refers to early use of the compass.&lt;ref name="cambridge1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 190"&gt;Needham p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first mention of a spoon, speculated to be a lodestone, observed '''pointing in a [[cardinal direction]]''' is a Chinese work composed between 70 and 80 AD (''[[Lunheng]]''), which records that "But when the south pointing spoon is thrown upon the ground, it comes to rest pointing at the south."&lt;ref name="Needham18"&gt;Needham p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Within the text, the author [[Wang Chong]] describes the spoon as a phenomenon that he has personally observed.&lt;ref name="Needham182"&gt;Needham p. 18 "''here the author is contrasting a fable which he did not believe with actual events he has seen with his own eyes''"&lt;/ref&gt; Although the passage does not explicitly mention magnetism,&lt;ref name="Li Shu-hua 180"&gt;Li Shu-hua, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; according to Chen-Cheng Yih, the "device described by Wang Chong has been widely considered to be the earliest form of the magnetic compass."&lt;ref name=en1 /&gt;
* The first clear account of '''[[magnetic declination]]''' occurs in the ''Kuan Shih Ti Li Chih Meng'' ("Mr. Kuan's Geomantic Instructor"), dating to 880.&lt;ref name="clerks"&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|title=Clerks and Craftsmen in China and the West|year=1970|pages=243–244|isbn=978-0-521-07235-9|publisher=Cambridge University Press|quote=The geomantic book Kuan Shih Ti Li Chih Meng... has the first account of it... the Chiu Thien Hsuan Nu Chhing Nang Hai Chio Ching... includes an implicit reference to declination}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another text, the ''Chiu Thien Hsuan Nu Chhing Nang Hai Chio Ching'' ("Blue Bag Sea Angle Manual") from around the same period, also has an implicit description of magnetic declination. It has been argued that this knowledge of declination requires the use of the compass.&lt;ref name="clerks" /&gt;
* A reference to a magnetized needle as a "'''mysterious needle'''" appears in 923–926 in the ''Chung Hua Ku Chin Chu'' text written by Ma Kao. The same passage is also attributed to the 4th-century AD writer Tshui Pao, although it is postulated that the former text is more authentic. The shape of the needle is compared to that of a tadpole, and may indicate the transition between "lodestone spoons" and "iron needles."&lt;ref name="Needham273-274"&gt;Needham p. 273-274&lt;/ref&gt;
* The earliest reference to a specific magnetic '''direction finder''' device for land navigation is recorded in a [[Song Dynasty]] book dated to 1040–44. There is a description of an iron "south-pointing fish" floating in a bowl of water, aligning itself to the south. The device is recommended as a means of orientation "in the obscurity of the night." The ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' (武經總要, "Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques") stated: "When troops encountered gloomy weather or dark nights, and the directions of space could not be distinguished...they made use of the [mechanical] [[south-pointing carriage]], or the south-pointing fish."&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 252" /&gt; This was achieved by heating of metal (especially if steel), known today as [[Thermoremanent magnetization|thermoremanence]], and would have been capable of producing a weak state of magnetization.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 252" /&gt; While the Chinese achieved magnetic [[remanence]] and induction by this time, in both Europe and Asia the phenomenon was attributed to the supernatural and occult, until about 1600 when [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] published his ''[[De Magnete]]''.&lt;ref name="Elman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin A. Elman|title=On Their Own Terms: Science in China, 1550–1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qm57OqARqpAC&amp;pg=PA24|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03647-5|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first incontestable reference to a '''magnetized needle''' in Chinese literature appears in 1088.&lt;ref name="Li Shu-hua, p. 182f" /&gt; The ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', written by the [[Song Dynasty]] [[polymath]] scientist [[Shen Kuo#Magnetic needle compass|Shen Kuo]], contained a detailed description of how [[geomancer]]s magnetized a [[Dial (measurement)|needle]] by rubbing its tip with lodestone, and hung the magnetic needle with one single strain of [[silk]] with a bit of wax attached to the center of the needle. Shen Kuo pointed out that a needle prepared this way sometimes pointed south, sometimes north.
* The earliest explicit recorded use of a magnetic compass for '''maritime navigation''' is found in [[Zhu Yu (author)|Zhu Yu]]'s book ''Pingchow Table Talks'' (萍洲可談; Pingzhou Ketan) and dates from 1111 to 1117: ''The ship's pilots are acquainted with the configuration of the coasts; at night they steer by the stars , and in the daytime by the sun. In dark weather they look at the south pointing needle''.&lt;ref name="Ronan" /&gt;

[[File:Ming-marine-compass.jpg|thumb|upright|Diagram of a [[Ming Dynasty]] mariner's compass]]

Thus, the use of a magnetic compass by the military for [[Land navigation (military)|land navigation]] occurred sometime before 1044, but incontestable evidence for the use of the compass as a maritime navigational device did not appear until 1117.

The typical Chinese navigational compass was in the form of a magnetic needle floating in a bowl of water.&lt;ref name="Kreutz, p. 373"&gt;Kreutz, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Joseph Needham|Needham]], the Chinese in the [[Song Dynasty]] and continuing [[Yuan Dynasty]] did make use of a dry compass, although this type never became as widely used in China as the wet compass.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 255"&gt;Needham p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this is found in the ''Shilin guangji'' ("Guide Through the Forest of Affairs"), published in 1325 by Chen Yuanjing, although its compilation had taken place between 1100 and 1250.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 255" /&gt; The dry compass in China was a dry suspension compass, a wooden frame crafted in the shape of a turtle hung upside down by a board, with the lodestone sealed in by wax, and if rotated, the needle at the tail would always point in the northern cardinal direction.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 255" /&gt; Although the European compass-card in box frame and dry pivot needle was adopted in China after its use was taken by [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] in the 16th century (who had in turn learned of it from Europeans),&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 289"&gt;Needham, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; the Chinese design of the suspended dry compass persisted in use well into the 18th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 290"&gt;Needham, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Kreutz there is only a single Chinese reference to a dry-mounted needle (built into a pivoted wooden tortoise) which is dated to between 1150 and 1250, and claims that there is no clear indication that Chinese mariners ever used anything but the floating needle in a bowl until the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Kreutz, p. 373" /&gt;

The first recorded use of a 48 position mariner's compass on sea navigation was noted in ''The Customs of Cambodia'' by Yuan Dynasty diplomat [[Zhou Daguan]], he described his 1296 voyage from [[Wenzhou]] to [[Angkor Thom]] in detail; when his ship set sail from Wenzhou, the mariner took a needle direction of “ding wei” position, which is equivalent to 22.5 degree SW. After they arrived at [[Ba Ria|Baria]], the mariner took "Kun Shen needle", or 52.5 degree SW.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zheng He]]'s Navigation Map, also known as the "[[Mao Kun map|Mao Kun Map]]", contains a large amount of detail "needle records" of [[Treasure voyages|Zheng He's expeditions]].&lt;ref name="Ma, Appendix 2"&gt;Ma, Appendix 2&lt;/ref&gt;

This is easily dismissed by a wider reading of the period. http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_gifts.htm#compass&lt;/ref&gt; From Neckam's description, some scholars have suggested it is not unlikely that the compass was also 'invented' in Europe, independently of Eastern technologies.&lt;ref name="Alexandri Neckam"&gt;T. Wright, (ed.) 'Preface', ''Alexandri Neckam De naturis rerum libri duo with the poem of the same author, De laudibus divinae sapientiae'', (London, 1863),xxxv&lt;/ref&gt; This is further supported by [[Jacques de Vitry]]'s mention of the compass being used at sea in 1218, which indicates a broader knowledge of the compass and its uses in Medieval Northern Europe: &lt;blockquote&gt;''An iron needle, after having been in contact with the loadstone, turns itself always toward the northern star, which, like the axis of the firmament, remains immoveable, while the others follow their course, so that it is very necessary to those who navigate the sea.''&lt;ref name="Alexandri Neckam"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Robert Southey]] suggested that the [[Siete Partidas]] contained a reference from the 1250s to the needle being used for navigation.&lt;ref name="omniana"&gt;{{cite book|last=Southey|first=Robert|title=Omniana|year=1812|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown|page=210|quote=There is a passage in the Partidas respecting the needle, which was written half a century before its supposed invention at Amalfi|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Omniana.djvu/231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1269 [[Petrus Peregrinus]] of Maricourt described a floating compass for astronomical purposes as well as a dry compass for seafaring, in his well-known ''Epistola de magnete''.&lt;ref name=Schmidl /&gt;

In the Mediterranean, the introduction of the compass, at first only known as a magnetized pointer floating in a bowl of water,&lt;ref&gt;Kreutz, p. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt; went hand in hand with improvements in [[dead reckoning]] methods, and the development of [[Portolan chart]]s, leading to more navigation during winter months in the second half of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 606f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt; While the practice from ancient times had been to curtail sea travel between October and April, due in part to the lack of dependable clear skies during the Mediterranean winter, the prolongation of the sailing season resulted in a gradual, but sustained increase in shipping movement; by around 1290 the sailing season could start in late January or February, and end in December.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 608&lt;/ref&gt; The additional few months were of considerable economic importance. For instance, it enabled [[Venice|Venetian]] convoys to make two round trips a year to the [[Levant]], instead of one.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 608 &amp; 610&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, traffic between the Mediterranean and northern Europe also increased, with first evidence of direct commercial voyages from the Mediterranean into the English Channel coming in the closing decades of the 13th century, and one factor may be that the compass made traversal of the [[Bay of Biscay]] safer and easier.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 608 &amp; 613&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics like Kreutz have suggested that it was later in 1410 that anyone really started steering by compass.&lt;ref&gt;Kreutz, p. 372–373&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muslim world ===
[[File:Al-Ashraf compass and qibla diagram.png|thumb|[[Al-Ashraf Umar II|Al-Ashraf]]'s diagram of the compass and Qibla. From MS Cairo TR 105, copied in Yemen, 1293.&lt;ref name=Schmidl /&gt;]]

The earliest reference to a compass in the [[Muslim world]] occurs in a [[Persian language|Persian]] talebook from 1232,&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 370" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jawāmeʿ al-ḥekāyāt wa-lawāmeʿ al-rewāyāt'' by Muhammad al-ʿAwfī&lt;/ref&gt; where a compass is used for navigation during a trip in the [[Red Sea]] or the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name=OEPST /&gt; The fish-shaped iron leaf described indicates that this early Chinese design has spread outside of China.&lt;ref name="Needham12-13"&gt;Needham p. 12-13 "''...that the floating fish-shaped iron leaf spread outside China as a technique, we know from the description of Muhammad al' Awfi just two hundred years later''"&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[Arabic language|Arabic]] reference to a compass, in the form of magnetic needle in a bowl of water, comes from a work by Baylak al-Qibjāqī, written in 1282 while in Cairo.&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 370" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kitāb Kanz al-tujjār fī maʿrifat al-aḥjār''&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qibjāqī described a needle-and-bowl compass used for navigation on a voyage he took from Syria to Alexandria in 1242.&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 370" /&gt; Since the author describes having witnessed the use of a compass on a ship trip some forty years earlier, some scholars are inclined to antedate its first appearance in the [[Arab world]] accordingly.&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 370" /&gt; Al-Qibjāqī also reports that sailors in the Indian Ocean used iron fish instead of needles.&lt;ref name=lancaster/&gt;

Late in the 13th century, the [[Yemen]]i Sultan and [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]] [[al-Malik al-Ashraf]] described the use of the compass as a "[[Qibla]] indicator" to find the direction to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savage-Smith | first1 = Emilie | year = 1988 | title = Gleanings from an Arabist's Workshop: Current Trends in the Study of Medieval Islamic Science and Medicine | url = | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 79 | issue = 2| pages = 246–266 [263] | doi=10.1086/354701}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a treatise about [[astrolabes]] and [[sundials]], al-Ashraf includes several paragraphs on the construction of a compass bowl (ṭāsa). He then uses the compass to determine the north point, the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] (khaṭṭ niṣf al-nahār), and the Qibla. This is the first mention of a compass in a medieval Islamic scientific text and its earliest known use as a Qibla indicator, although al-Ashraf did not claim to be the first to use it for this purpose.&lt;ref name=Schmidl /&gt;&lt;ref name=BEA&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor = Thomas Hockey et al | last = Schmidl | first = Petra G. | title=Ashraf: al‐Malik al‐Ashraf (Mumahhid al‐Dīn) ʿUmar ibn Yūsuf ibn ʿUmar ibn ʿAlī ibn Rasūl | encyclopedia = The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers | publisher = Springer | year = 2007 | location = New York | pages = 66–7 | url=http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Ashraf_BEA.htm | isbn=9780387310220| ref=harv}} ([http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Ashraf_BEA.pdf PDF version])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1300, an Arabic treatise written by the [[Egypt]]ian astronomer and [[muezzin]] Ibn Simʿūn describes a dry compass used for determining qibla. Like Peregrinus' compass, however, Ibn Simʿūn's compass did not feature a compass card.&lt;ref name="Schmidl" /&gt; In the 14th century, the [[Syria]]n astronomer and timekeeper [[Ibn al-Shatir]] (1304–1375) invented a [[time]]keeping device incorporating both a universal [[sundial]] and a magnetic compass.

One instrument is a “fish” made of willow wood or pumpkin, into which a magnetic needle is inserted and sealed with tar or wax to prevent the penetration of water. The other instrument is a dry compass.&lt;ref name=lancaster/&gt;
[[File:Compass thumbnail.jpg|thumb|Navigational [[sailor]]'s compass rose, 1607]]

In the 15th century, the description given by [[Ibn Majid]] while aligning the compass with the pole star indicates that he was aware of [[magnetic declination]]. An explicit value for the declination is given by ʿIzz al-Dīn al-Wafāʾī (fl. 1450s in Cairo).&lt;ref name=OEPST /&gt;

Pre modern Arabic sources refer to the compass using the term ''ṭāsa'' (lit. "bowl") for the floating compass, or ''ālat al-qiblah'' ("qibla instrument") for a device used for orienting towards Mecca.&lt;ref name=OEPST&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-981257-8| editor= Ibrahim Kalin | last = Schmidl | first = Petra G. | title = Compass | encyclopedia = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Science, and Technology in Islam| date = 2014-05-08| pages=144-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hirth]] suggested that Arab and Persian traders, who learned about the polarity of the magnetic needle from the Chinese, applied the compass for navigation before the Chinese did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = New York, The Columbia university press| last = Hirth| first = Friedrich| title = Ancient history of China to the end of the Chóu dynasty,| date = 1908| url = https://archive.org/details/ancienthistoryof00hirt|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Needham described this theory as "erroneous" and "it originates because of a mistraslation" of the term ''chia-ling'' found in [[Zhu Yu (author)|Zhu Yu]]'s book ''Pingchow Table Talks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-05802-5| last = Needham| first = Joseph| title = Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 1, Physics| date = 1962 |pages=279-80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
The development of the magnetic compass is highly uncertain. The compass is mentioned in fourth-century AD [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[nautical]] books; moreover, its early name of ''macchayantra'' (fish machine) suggest a Chinese origin. In its Indian form, the wet compass often consisted of a fish-shaped magnet, float in a bowl filled with oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|editor=Helaine Selin |publisher= |page=197|isbn=978-1-4020-4559-2|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUAPAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22matsya+yantra%22+%2B+compass&amp;q=%22matsya+yantra%22 |title=The American Journal of Science|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2009-06-30|year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fish shape is due to its name, which is composed of the words ''maccha'' meaning ''fish'' and ''yantra'' meaning ''device''.&lt;ref name="Needham12-13" /&gt;

=== Medieval Africa ===
There is evidence that the distribution of the compass from China likely also reached eastern Africa by way of trade through the end of the Silk Road that ended in [[East Africa]]n centre of trade in [[Somalia]] and the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] city-state kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Foster Stockwell|Stockwell]]|first=Foster|title=Westerners in China : a history of exploration and trade, ancient times through the present|year=2003|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.

== Dry compass ==
[[File:Kardanischer-Kompass.jpg|thumb|[[Early modern period|Early modern]] dry compass suspended by a [[gimbal]] (1570)]]

The dry mariner's compass consists of three elements: A freely pivoting needle on a pin enclosed in a little box with a glass cover and a [[wind rose]], whereby "the wind rose or compass card is attached to a magnetized needle in such a manner that when placed on a pivot in a box fastened in line with the keel of the ship the card would turn as the ship changed direction, indicating always what course the ship was on".&lt;ref name="Lane, p. 615"&gt;Lane, p. 615&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, compasses were often fitted into a [[gimbal]] mounting to reduce grounding of the needle or card when used on the pitching and rolling deck of a ship.

While pivoting needles in glass boxes had already been described by the French scholar [[Peter Peregrinus]] in 1269,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Egyptian scholar Ibn Simʿūn in 1300,&lt;ref name=Schmidl /&gt; traditionally [[Flavio Gioja]] (fl. 1302), an Italian [[pilot (harbour)|pilot]] from [[Amalfi]], has been credited with perfecting the sailor's compass by suspending its needle over a compass card, thus giving the compass its familiar appearance.&lt;ref name="Frederic C. Lane 616"&gt;Lane, p. 616&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt; Such a compass with the needle attached to a rotating card is also described in a commentary on [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' from 1380, while an earlier source refers to a portable compass in a box (1318),&lt;ref&gt;Kreutz, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the notion that the dry compass was known in Europe by then.&lt;ref name="Kreutz, p. 373" /&gt;

== Bearing compass ==
[[File:Bearing compass.jpg|thumb|upright|Bearing compass (18th century)]]

A ''bearing compass'' is a magnetic compass mounted in such a way that it allows the taking of [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] of objects by aligning them with the [[lubber line]] of the bearing compass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westcoastoffshore.ca/Search.aspx?k=compass |title=Hand Bearing Compass |year=2009 |publisher=West Coast Offshore Marine |accessdate=2014-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[surveyor's compass]]'' is a specialized compass made to accurately measure heading of landmarks and measure horizontal angles to help with [[Cartography|map making]]. These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 [[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]].  The bearing compass was steadily reduced in size and weight to increase portability, resulting in a model that could be carried and operated in one hand.  In 1885, a patent was granted for a [[hand compass]] fitted with a viewing prism and lens that enabled the user to accurately sight the heading of geographical landmarks, thus creating the ''[[sighting compass|prismatic compass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, Persifor, ''A Convenient Device to be Applied to the Hand Compass'', Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 22, No. 118 (Mar., 1885), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  Another sighting method was by means of a reflective mirror.  First patented in 1902, the ''Bézard compass'' consisted of a field compass with a mirror mounted above it.&lt;ref name="Article"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Patrick Donzey |url=http://www.compassmuseum.com/hand/bezard.htm |title=Bezard 1 |publisher=Compass Museum |date= |accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Scott, Churchill, James, and Jacobson, Cliff, ''The Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Navigation'', Globe Pequot Press (2002), {{ISBN|1-58574-490-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58574-490-9}}, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  This arrangement enabled the user to align the compass with an objective while simultaneously viewing its bearing in the mirror.&lt;ref name="Article" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Gunnar Tillander, a Swedish unemployed instrument maker and avid participant in the sport of [[orienteering]], invented a new style of bearing compass.  Dissatisfied with existing field compasses, which required a separate protractor in order to take bearings from a map, Tillander decided to incorporate both instruments into a single instrument. It combined a compass with a protractor built into the base.  His design featured a metal compass capsule containing a magnetic needle with orienting marks mounted into a transparent protractor baseplate with a lubber line (later called a ''direction of travel indicator'').  By rotating the capsule to align the needle with the orienting marks, the course bearing could be read at the lubber line.  Moreover, by aligning the baseplate with a course drawn on a map – ignoring the needle – the compass could also function as a protractor.  Tillander took his design to fellow orienteers [[Björn Kjellström|Björn]], Alvid, and Alvar Kjellström, who were selling basic compasses, and the four men modified Tillander's design.&lt;ref name="LIT"&gt;Litsky, Frank, ''Bjorn Kjellstrom, 84, Orienteer and Inventor of Modern Compass'', Obituaries, The New York Times, 1 September 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1932, the Silva Company was formed with Tillander and the three Kjellström brothers, and the company began manufacturing and selling its [[Silva compass|Silva orienteering compass]] to Swedish orienteers, outdoorsmen, and army officers.&lt;ref name="LIT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kjellström, Björn, ''19th Hole: The Readers Take Over: Orienteering'', Sports Illustrated, 3 March 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silva Sweden AB, ''Silva Sweden AB and Silva Production AB Become One Company: History'', Press Release 28 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liquid compass ==
[[File:Flush mount compass.jpg|thumb|A surface liquid-filled compass on a boat]]

The liquid compass is a design in which the magnetized needle or card is damped by fluid to protect against excessive swing or wobble, improving readability while reducing wear. A rudimentary working model of a liquid compass was introduced by Sir [[Edmund Halley]] at a meeting of the [[Royal Society]] in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;Gubbins, David, ''Encyclopedia of Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism'', Springer Press (2007), {{ISBN|1-4020-3992-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4020-3992-8}}, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as early liquid compasses were fairly cumbersome and heavy, and subject to damage, their main advantage was aboard ship.  Protected in a [[binnacle]] and normally [[gimbal]]-mounted, the liquid inside the compass housing effectively damped shock and vibration, while eliminating excessive swing and grounding of the card caused by the pitch and roll of the vessel. The first liquid mariner's compass believed practicable for limited use was patented by the Englishman Francis Crow in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, A.E., ''Steady As She Goes: A History of the Compass Department of the Admiralty'', HMSO, Department of the Admiralty (1986), pp. 1-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gubbins, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Liquid-damped marine compasses for ships and small boats were occasionally used by the [[Royal Navy]] from the 1830s through 1860, but the standard Admiralty compass remained a dry-mount type.&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, A.E., pp. 1-10&lt;/ref&gt;  In the latter year, the American physicist and inventor [[Edward Samuel Ritchie]] patented a greatly improved liquid marine compass that was adopted in revised form for general use by the [[United States Navy]], and later purchased by the Royal Navy as well.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Deborah, ''Compasses and Coils: The Instrument Business of Edward S. Ritchie'', Rittenhouse, Vol. 9, No. 1 (1994), pp. 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these advances, the liquid compass was not introduced generally into the Royal Navy until 1908. An early version developed by RN Captain Creak proved to be operational under heavy gunfire and seas, but was felt to lack navigational precision compared with the design by Lord Kelvin.&lt;ref name="W. H. Creak 238-239" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gubbins, p. 67: The use of parallel or multiple needles was by no means a new development; their use in dry-mount marine compasses was pioneered by navigation officers of the [[Dutch East India Company]] as early as 1649.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with ship and gun sizes continuously increasing, the advantages of the liquid compass over the Kelvin compass became unavoidably apparent to the Admiralty, and after widespread adoption by other navies, the liquid compass was generally adopted by the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name="W. H. Creak 238-239"&gt;W. H. Creak: "The History of the Liquid Compass", ''The Geographical Journal'', Vol. 56, No. 3 (1920), pp. 238-239&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aero Magnetic Compass.jpg|thumb|left|Typical aircraft-mounted magnetic compass]]
Liquid compasses were next adapted for aircraft.  In 1909, Captain [[F.O. Creagh-Osborne]], Superintendent of Compasses at the Admiralty, introduced his ''Creagh-Osborne'' aircraft compass, which used a mixture of alcohol and distilled water to damp the compass card.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Sophia, ''Raising The Aerocompass In Early Twentieth-century Britain'', British Journal for the History of Science, published online by Cambridge University Press, 15 Jul 2008, pp. 1-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colvin, Fred H., ''Aircraft Mechanics Handbook: A Collection of Facts and Suggestions from Factory and Flying Field to Assist in Caring for Modern Aircraft'', McGraw-Hill Book Co. Inc. (1918), pp. 347-348&lt;/ref&gt;  After the success of this invention, Capt. Creagh-Osborne adapted his design to a much smaller pocket model&lt;ref&gt;The Compass Museum, [http://www.compassmuseum.com/wrist/wrist_1.htm#C-O Article]: Though the ''Creagh-Osborne'' was offered in a wrist-mount model, it proved too bulky and heavy in this form.&lt;/ref&gt; for individual use&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Henry A., ''Improvements in prismatic compasses with special reference to the Creagh-Osborne patent compass'', Transactions of The Optical Society 16, London: The Optical Society (1915), pp. 17-43: The first liquid-damped compass compact enough for pocket or pouch was the ''Creagh-Osborne'', patented in 1915 in Great Britain.&lt;/ref&gt; by officers of artillery or infantry, receiving a patent in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Henry A., pp. 17-43&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1932, the newly founded Silva Company of Sweden introduced its first baseplate or bearing compass that used a liquid-filled capsule to damp the swing of the magnetized needle.&lt;ref name="LIT" /&gt;  The liquid-damped Silva took only four seconds for its needle to settle in comparison to thirty seconds for the original version.&lt;ref name="LIT" /&gt;

In 1933 [[Tuomas Vohlonen]], a surveyor by profession, applied for a patent for a unique method of filling and sealing a lightweight [[celluloid]] compass housing or capsule with a petroleum distillate to dampen the needle and protect it from shock and wear caused by excessive motion.&lt;ref name="december2001"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080216024046/http://www.suunto.com/suunto/Worlds/outdoor/main/outdoor_article_normal.jsp]&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced in a wrist-mount model in 1936 as the [[Suunto]] Oy ''Model M-311'', the new capsule design led directly to the lightweight liquid-filled field compasses of today.&lt;ref name="december2001" /&gt;

== Gyrocompass ==

The first gyroscope for scientific use was made by the French physicist Jean Bernard Léon Foucault (1819–1868) in 1852, who also named the device, while researching in the same line that led him to use the eponymous pendulum, for which he was awarded a Copley Medal by the Royal Society. The gyrocompass was patented in 1885 by Marinus Gerardus van den Bos in The Netherlands after continuous spinning was made possible by small electric motors, which were in turn a technological outcome of the discovery of magnetic induction.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt; Yet only in 1906 was the German inventor Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe (1872–1931) able to build the first practical gyrocompass. It had two major advantages over magnetic compasses: it indicated true north and was unaffected by ferromagnetic materials, such as the steel hull of ships. Thus, it was widely used in the warships of World War I and modern aircraft.

== Non-navigational uses ==

=== Astronomy ===
Three compasses meant for establishing the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] were described by [[Peter of Maricourt|Peter Peregrinus]] in 1269 (referring to experiments made before 1248)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 1f.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the 13th century, [[al-Malik al-Ashraf]] of Yemen wrote a treatise on astrolabes, which included instructions and diagrams on using the compass to determine the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] (khaṭṭ niṣf al-nahār) and [[Qibla]].&lt;ref name=Schmidl /&gt; In 1300, a treatise written by the [[Egypt]]ian astronomer and [[muezzin]] Ibn Simʿūn describes a dry compass for use as a "Qibla indicator" to find the direction to [[Mecca]]. Ibn Simʿūn's compass, however, did not feature a compass card nor the familiar glass box.&lt;ref name=Schmidl /&gt; In the 14th century, the [[Syria]]n astronomer and timekeeper [[Ibn al-Shatir]] (1304–1375) invented a [[time]]keeping device incorporating both a universal [[sundial]] and a magnetic compass.

Evidence for the orientation of buildings by the means of a magnetic compass can be found in 12th-century [[Denmark]]: one fourth of its 570 [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque churches]] are rotated by 5–15 degrees clockwise from true east-west, thus corresponding to the predominant magnetic declination of the time of their construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1992.tb00499.x|pages=293–303| id=See page 293|title=Evidence for Church Orientation by Magnetic Compass in Twelfth-Century Denmark|journal=Archaeometry|volume=34|issue=2|year=1992|last1=Abrahamsen|first1=N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these churches were built in the 12th century, indicating a fairly common usage of magnetic compasses in [[Europe]] by then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1992.tb00499.x|pages=293–303| id=See page 303|title=Evidence for Church Orientation by Magnetic Compass in Twelfth-Century Denmark|journal=Archaeometry|volume=34|issue=2|year=1992|last1=Abrahamsen|first1=N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mining ===
The use of a compass as a direction finder underground was pioneered in the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] mining town [[Massa]] where floating magnetic needles were employed for tunnelling, and for defining the claims of the various mining companies, as early as the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig and Schmidtchen, p. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 15th century, the compass became standard equipment for [[German Tyrol|Tyrolian]] miners. Shortly afterwards the first detailed treatise dealing with the underground use of compasses was published by a [[Germany|German]] miner [[Rülein von Calw]] (1463–1525).&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig and Schmidtchen, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sun compass ===
{{See also|Cardinal direction#Watch face|Sundial#Using a sundial as a compass}}
A sun compass uses the position of the Sun in the sky to determine the directions of the cardinal points, making allowance for the local latitude and longitude, time of day, [[equation of time]], and so on. At fairly high latitudes, an analog-display [[watch]] can be used as a very approximate sun compass. A simple sundial can be used as a much better one. An automatic sun compass developed by Lt. Col. [[James Allason]], a mechanised cavalry officer, was adopted by the British Army in India in 1938 for use in tanks and other armoured vehicles where the magnetic field was subject to distortion, affecting the standard issue prismatic compass. Cloudy skies prohibited its use in European theatres. A copy of the manual is preserved in the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Ringside Seat, by James Allason, Timewell Press, London 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], '''hyperbolic motions''' are [[isometry|isometric]] [[automorphism]]s of a [[hyperbolic space]]. Under composition of mappings, the hyperbolic motions form a [[continuous group]]. This group is said to characterize the hyperbolic space. Such an approach to geometry was cultivated by [[Felix Klein]] in his [[Erlangen program]]. The idea of reducing geometry to its characteristic group was developed particularly by [[Mario Pieri]] in his reduction of the [[primitive notion]]s of geometry to merely [[point (geometry)|point]] and ''motion''.

Hyperbolic motions are often taken from [[inversive geometry]]: these are mappings composed of reflections in a line or a circle (or in a [[hyperplane]] or a [[hypersphere]] for hyperbolic spaces of more than two dimensions). To distinguish the hyperbolic motions, a particular line or circle is taken as the [[Cayley absolute|absolute]]. The proviso is that the absolute must be an [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|invariant set]] of all hyperbolic motions. The absolute divides the plane into two [[Connected component (topology)|connected components]], and hyperbolic motions must ''not'' permute these components.

One of the most prevalent contexts for inversive geometry and hyperbolic motions is in the study of mappings of the [[complex plane]] by [[Möbius transformation]]s. Textbooks on [[complex function]]s often mention two common models of hyperbolic geometry: the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] where the absolute is the real line on the complex plane, and the [[Poincaré disk model]] where the absolute is the [[unit circle]] in the complex plane.
Hyperbolic motions can also be described on the [[hyperboloid model]] of hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miles Reid]] &amp; Balázs Szendröi (2005) ''Geometry and Topology'', §3.11 Hyperbolic motions, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-61325-6}}, {{MathSciNet|id=2194744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article exhibits these examples of the use of hyperbolic motions: the extension of the metric &lt;math&gt;d(a,b) = \vert \log(b/a) \vert&lt;/math&gt; to the half-plane, and in the location of a [[quasi-sphere]] of a hypercomplex number system.

== Motions on the hyperbolic plane ==
{{see also|transformation geometry}}

&lt;!--Copied from [[hyperbolic geometry#Isometries of the hyperbolic plane]] --&gt;

Every [[motion (geometry)|motion]] ([[Geometric transformation| transformation]] or [[isometry]]) of the hyperbolic plane to itself can be realized as the composition of at most three [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]]. In ''n''-dimensional hyperbolic space, up to ''n''+1 reflections might be required. (These are also true for Euclidean and spherical geometries, but the classification below is different.)

All the isometries of the hyperbolic plane can be classified into these classes:
* Orientation preserving
** the [[Identity function|identity isometry]] &amp;mdash; nothing moves; zero reflections; zero [[degrees of freedom]].
** [[Point reflection|inversion through a point (half turn)]] &amp;mdash; two reflections through mutually perpendicular lines passing through the given point, i.e. a rotation of 180 degrees around the point; two [[degrees of freedom]].
** [[Reflection (mathematics)|rotation]] around a normal point &amp;mdash; two reflections through lines passing through the given point (includes inversion as a special case); points move on circles around the center; three degrees of freedom.
** "rotation" around an [[ideal point]] (horolation)  &amp;mdash; two reflections through lines leading to the ideal point; points move along horocycles centered on the ideal point; two degrees of freedom.
** translation along a straight line &amp;mdash; two reflections through lines perpendicular to the given line; points off the given line move along hypercycles; three degrees of freedom.
* Orientation reversing
** reflection through a line &amp;mdash; one reflection; two degrees of freedom.
** combined reflection through a line and translation along the same line &amp;mdash; the reflection and translation commute; three reflections required; three degrees of freedom.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Introduction of metric in the Poincaré half-plane model==
[[Image:Ultraparallel theorem.svg|thumb|right|alt=semi-circles as hyperbolic lines|For some hyperbolic motions in the half-plane see the [[Ultraparallel theorem]].]]

The points of the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] HP are given in [[Cartesian coordinates]] as {(''x'',''y''): ''y'' &gt; 0} or in [[polar coordinates]] as {(''r'' cos ''a'', ''r'' sin ''a''): 0 &lt; ''a'' &lt; π, ''r'' &gt; 0 }.
The hyperbolic motions will be taken to be a [[function composition|composition]] of three fundamental hyperbolic motions.
Let  ''p'' = (''x,y'')  or  ''p'' = (''r'' cos ''a'', ''r'' sin ''a''), ''p'' ∈ HP.  

The fundamental motions are:
: ''p'' → ''q'' = (''x'' + ''c'', ''y'' ), ''c'' ∈ '''R''' (left or right shift)
: ''p'' → ''q'' = (''sx'', ''sy'' ),  ''s'' &gt; 0  ([[Homothetic transformation|dilation]])
: ''p'' → ''q'' = ( ''r''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; cos ''a'',  ''r''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; sin ''a'' ) ([[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|inversion in unit semicircle]]).
Note: the shift and dilation are mappings from inversive geometry composed of a pair of reflections in vertical lines or concentric circles respectively.

===Use of semi-circle Z===
Consider the triangle {(0,0),(1,0),(1,tan ''a'')}. Since 1 + tan&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''a'' = sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''a'', the length of the triangle hypotenuse is sec ''a'', where sec denotes the [[Trigonometric functions#Reciprocal functions|secant]] function. Set ''r'' = sec ''a'' and apply the third fundamental hyperbolic motion to obtain  ''q'' = (''r'' cos ''a'', ''r'' sin ''a'') where  ''r'' = sec&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''a'' = cos ''a''.  Now
:|''q'' &amp;ndash; (½, 0)|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''a'' &amp;ndash; ½)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''a'' sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''a'' = ¼

so that ''q'' lies on the semicircle ''Z'' of radius ½ and center (½, 0). Thus the tangent ray at (1, 0) gets mapped to ''Z'' by the third fundamental hyperbolic motion.  Any semicircle can be re-sized by a dilation to radius ½ and shifted to ''Z'', then the inversion carries it to the tangent ray. So the collection  of hyperbolic motions permutes the semicircles with diameters on ''y'' = 0 sometimes with vertical rays, and vice versa.  Suppose one agrees to measure length on vertical rays by using [[logarithmic measure]]:
:''d''((''x'',''y''),(''x'',''z'')) = |log(''z''/''y'')|.

Then by means of hyperbolic motions one can measure distances between points on semicircles too: first move the points to ''Z'' with appropriate shift and dilation, then place them by inversion on the tangent ray where the logarithmic distance is known.

For  ''m'' and ''n'' in HP, let  ''b'' be the [[perpendicular bisector]] of the line segment connecting ''m'' and ''n''. If ''b'' is parallel to the [[abscissa]], then ''m'' and ''n'' are connected by a vertical ray, otherwise ''b'' intersects the abscissa so there is a semicircle centered at this intersection that passes through ''m'' and ''n''. The set HP becomes a [[metric space]] when equipped with the distance  ''d''(''m'',''n'') for  ''m'',''n'' ∈ HP as found on the vertical ray or semicircle. One calls the vertical rays and semicircles the ''hyperbolic lines'' in HP.
The geometry of points and hyperbolic lines in HP is an example of a [[non-Euclidean geometry]]; nevertheless, the construction of the line and distance concepts for HP relies heavily on the original geometry of Euclid.

==Disk model motions==
Consider the disk D = {''z'' ∈ '''C''' : ''z z''* &lt; 1 } in the [[complex plane]] '''C'''. The geometric plane of [[Lobachevsky]] can be displayed in D with circular arcs perpendicular to the boundary of D signifying ''hyperbolic lines''. Using the arithmetic and geometry of complex numbers, and [[Möbius transformation]]s, there is the [[Poincaré disc model]] of the hyperbolic plane:

Suppose ''a'' and ''b'' are complex numbers with ''a a''*&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b b''* = 1. Note that
:|''bz'' + ''a''*|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; |''az'' + ''b''*|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (''aa''* &amp;minus; ''bb''*)(1 &amp;minus; |''z''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),
so that |''z''| &lt; 1 implies |(''a''z + ''b''*)/(''bz'' + ''a''*)| &lt; 1 . Hence the disk D is an [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|invariant set]] of the Möbius transformation
:f(''z'') = (''az'' + ''b''*)/(''bz'' + ''a''*).
Since it also permutes the hyperbolic lines, we see that these transformations are '''motions''' of the D model of [[hyperbolic geometry]]. A complex matrix 
:&lt;math&gt;q = \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ b^* &amp; a^* \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
with ''aa''* &amp;minus; ''bb''* = 1, which represents the Möbius transformation from the [[complex projective line|projective viewpoint]], can be considered to be on the [[hyperboloid#Relation to the sphere|unit quasi-sphere]] in the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of [[coquaternion]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3237">In [[mathematics]], the '''Jacobsthal numbers''' are an [[integer sequence]] named after the [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Ernst Jacobsthal]].  Like the related [[Fibonacci number]]s, they are a specific type of [[Lucas sequence]] &lt;math&gt;U_n(P,Q)&lt;/math&gt; for which ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;2&lt;ref name="mathworld"&gt;{{MathWorld |urlname=JacobsthalNumber |title = Jacobsthal Number}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and are defined by a similar [[recurrence relation]]: in simple terms, the sequence starts with 0 and 1, then each following number is found by adding the number before it to twice the number before that.  The first Jacobsthal numbers are:

:[[0 (number)|0]], [[1 (number)|1]], 1, [[3 (number)|3]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[21 (number)|21]], [[43 (number)|43]], [[85 (number)|85]], [[171 (number)|171]], 341, 683, 1365, 2731, 5461, 10923, 21845, 43691, 87381, 174763, 349525, … {{OEIS|id=A001045}}

== Jacobsthal numbers ==

Jacobsthal numbers are defined by the recurrence relation:

:&lt;math&gt; 
  J_n =  
    \begin{cases}
      0                     &amp; \mbox{if } n = 0; \\
      1                     &amp; \mbox{if } n = 1; \\
      J_{n-1} + 2J_{n-2}    &amp; \mbox{if } n &gt; 1. \\
    \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The next Jacobsthal number is also given by the recursion formula:

: &lt;math&gt; J_{n+1} = 2J_n + (-1)^n \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

or by:

: &lt;math&gt; J_{n+1} = 2^n - J_n. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The first recursion formula above is also satisfied by the powers of &lt;nowiki&gt;2&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The Jacobsthal number at a specific point in the sequence may be calculated directly using the closed-form equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A001045|name=Jacobsthal sequence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  J_n = \frac{2^n - (-1)^n}
    3.
&lt;/math&gt;
The [[generating function]] for the Jacobsthal numbers is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{(1+x)(1-2x)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The sum of the reciprocals of the Jacobsthal numbers is approximately 2.7186, slightly larger than [[e (mathematical constant)|e]].

== Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers ==

Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers represent the complementary Lucas sequence &lt;math&gt;V_n(1,-2)&lt;/math&gt;. They satisfy the same recurrence relation as Jacobsthal numbers but have different initial values: 

:&lt;math&gt; 
  j_n =  
    \begin{cases}
      2                     &amp; \mbox{if } n = 0; \\
      1                     &amp; \mbox{if } n = 1; \\
      j_{n-1} + 2j_{n-2}    &amp; \mbox{if } n &gt; 1. \\
    \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The following Jacobsthal-Lucas number also satisfies:&lt;ref name="oeis_jl"&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A014551|name=Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  j_{n+1} = 2j_n - 3(-1)^n. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The Jacobsthal-Lucas number at a specific point in the sequence may be calculated directly using the closed-form equation:&lt;ref name="oeis_jl" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  j_n = 2^n + (-1)^n. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The first Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers are:

:[[2 (number)|2]], [[1 (number)|1]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[17 (number)|17]], [[31 (number)|31]], [[65 (number)|65]], [[127 (number)|127]], [[257 (number)|257]], 511, 1025, 2047, 4097, 8191, 16385, 32767, 65537, 131071, 262145, 524287, 1048577, … {{OEIS|id=A014551}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1594">'''Jamshidian's trick''' is a technique for one-factor [[Asset pricing|asset price models]], which re-expresses an [[Option (finance)|option]] on a [[Portfolio_(finance)|portfolio of assets]] as a portfolio of options. It was developed by [[Farshid Jamshidian]] in 1989.

The trick relies on the following simple, but very useful mathematical observation. Consider a sequence of [[Monotonic_function|monotone (increasing) functions]] &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; of one real variable (which map onto &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;), a [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, and a constant &lt;math&gt;K\ge0&lt;/math&gt;. 

Since the function &lt;math&gt;\sum_i f_i&lt;/math&gt; is also increasing and maps onto &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique solution &lt;math&gt;w\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to the equation &lt;math&gt;\sum_i f_i(w)=K.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the functions &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; are increasing:

[[Image:wiki linear function.png|thumb|right|Graph of the linear function: {{math|1=''y''(''x'') = −''x'' + 2}}]]&lt;!-- people, find an SVG image please instead of this abomination --&gt;
In [[calculus]] and related areas of mathematics, a '''linear function''' from the real numbers to the real numbers is a function whose graph (in [[Cartesian coordinates]] with uniform scales) is a [[line (geometry)|line]] in the plane.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 2012, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  
The characteristic property of linear functions is that when the input variable is changed, the change in the output is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the change in the input.

Linear functions are related to [[linear equation]]s.

== Properties ==
A linear function is a [[polynomial function]] in which the [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] {{mvar|x}} has degree at most one:&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 2012, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax+b&lt;/math&gt;.
Such a function is called ''linear'' because its [[graph of a function|graph]], the set of all points &lt;math&gt;(x,f(x))&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Cartesian plane]], is a [[line (geometry)|line]]. The coefficient ''a'' is called the ''slope'' of the function and of the line (see below).
 
If the slope is &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;, this is a ''constant function'' &lt;math&gt;f(x)=b&lt;/math&gt; defining a horizontal line, which some authors exclude from the class of linear functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this definition, the degree of a linear polynomial would be exactly one, its graph a diagonal line neither vertical nor horizontal. However, we will not require &lt;math&gt;a\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; in this article, so constant functions will be considered linear.

The natural [[Domain of a function|domain]] of a linear function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the set of allowed input values for ''x'', is the entire set of [[real number]]s, &lt;math&gt;x\in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. One can also consider such functions with ''x'' in an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]], taking the coefficients ''a,b'' in that field. 

The graph &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)=ax+b&lt;/math&gt; is a non-vertical line having exactly one intersection with the ''y''-axis, its ''y''-intercept point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(0,b)&lt;/math&gt;. The ''y''-intercept value &lt;math&gt;y=f(0)=b&lt;/math&gt; is also called the ''initial value'' of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;a\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, the graph is a non-horizontal line having exactly one intersection with the ''x''-axis, the ''x''-intercept point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(-\tfrac ba,0)&lt;/math&gt;. The ''x''-intercept value &lt;math&gt;x=-\tfrac ba&lt;/math&gt;, the solution of the equation &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;, is also called the ''root'' or [[zero of a function|''zero'']] of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Slope==
[[File:Slope picture.svg|thumb|right|128px|The slope of a line is the ratio &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt; between a change in {{mvar|x}}, denoted {{math|&amp;Delta;''x''}}, and the corresponding change in {{mvar|y}}, denoted {{math|&amp;Delta;''y''}}]]
The [[slope (mathematics)|slope]] of a nonvertical line is a number that measures how steeply the line is slanted (rise-over-run). If the line is the graph of the linear function {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''ax'' + ''b''}}, this slope is given by the constant {{mvar|a}}. 

The slope measures the constant rate of change of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; per unit change in ''x'': whenever the input {{mvar|x}} is increased by one unit, the output changes by {{mvar|a}} units: &lt;math&gt;f(x{+}1)=f(x)+a&lt;/math&gt;, and more generally &lt;math&gt;f(x{+}\Delta x)=f(x)+a\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; for any number &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;. If the slope is positive, &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is increasing; if &lt;math&gt;a &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is decreasing

In [[differential calculus|calculus]], the derivative of a general function measures its rate of change. A linear function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax+b&lt;/math&gt; has a constant rate of change equal to its slope {{mvar|a}}, so its derivative is the constant function &lt;math&gt;f\,'(x)=a&lt;/math&gt;. 

The fundamental idea of differential calculus is that any [[differentiable function|smooth]] function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily linear) can be closely [[linear approximation|approximated]] near a given point &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; by a unique linear function. The [[derivative]] &lt;math&gt;f\,'(c)&lt;/math&gt; is the slope of this linear function, and the approximation is: &lt;math&gt;f(x) \approx f\,'(c)(x{-}c)+f(c)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\approx c&lt;/math&gt;. The graph of the linear approximation is the [[tangent line]] of the graph &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;(c,f(c))&lt;/math&gt;. The derivative slope &lt;math&gt;f\,'(c)&lt;/math&gt; generally varies with the point ''c''. Linear functions can be characterized as the only real functions whose derivative is constant: if &lt;math&gt;f\,'(x)=a&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', then &lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax+b&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;b=f(0)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Slope-intercept, point-slope, and two-point forms==
A given linear function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be written in several standard formulas displaying its various properties. The simplest is the ''slope-intercept form'': 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)= ax+b&lt;/math&gt;, 
from which one can immediately see the slope ''a'' and the initial value &lt;math&gt;f(0)=b&lt;/math&gt;, which is the ''y''-intercept of the graph &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Given a slope ''a'' and one known value &lt;math&gt;f(x_0)=y_0&lt;/math&gt;, we write the ''point-slope form'': 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a(x{-}x_0)+y_0&lt;/math&gt;. 
In graphical terms, this gives the line &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; with slope ''a'' passing through the point &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0)&lt;/math&gt;. 

The ''two-point form'' starts with two known values &lt;math&gt;f(x_0)=y_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x_1)=y_1&lt;/math&gt;. One computes the slope &lt;math&gt;a=\tfrac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}&lt;/math&gt; and inserts this into the point-slope form: 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \tfrac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}(x{-}x_0\!) + y_0&lt;/math&gt;.
Its graph &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the unique line passing through the points &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0\!), (x_1,y_1\!)&lt;/math&gt;. The equation &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; may also be written to emphasize the constant slope:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}=\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Relationship with linear equations==
[[Image:wiki linearna funkcija eks1.png|thumb|right]]&lt;!-- are PNG and a translit from a foreign language necessary? --&gt; 
Linear functions commonly arise from practical problems involving variables &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; with a linear relationship, that is, obeying a [[linear equation]] &lt;math&gt;Ax+By=C&lt;/math&gt;. If  &lt;math&gt;B\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, one can solve this equation for ''y'', obtaining
:&lt;math&gt;y = -\tfrac{A}{B}x +\tfrac{C}{B}=ax+b,&lt;/math&gt;
where we denote &lt;math&gt;a=-\tfrac{A}{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=\tfrac{C}{B}&lt;/math&gt;. That is, one may consider ''y'' as a dependent variable (output) obtained from the independent variable (input) ''x'' via a linear function: &lt;math&gt;y = f(x) = ax+b&lt;/math&gt;. In the ''xy''-coordinate plane, the possible values of &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; form a line, the graph of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;B=0&lt;/math&gt; in the original equation, the resulting line &lt;math&gt;x=\tfrac{C}{A}&lt;/math&gt; is vertical, and cannot be written as &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The features of the graph &lt;math&gt;y = f(x) = ax+b&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted in terms of the variables ''x'' and ''y''. The ''y''-intercept is the initial value &lt;math&gt;y=f(0)=b&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;. The slope ''a'' measures the rate of change of the output ''y'' per unit change in the input ''x''. In the graph, moving one unit to the right (increasing ''x'' by 1) moves the ''y''-value up by ''a'': that is, &lt;math&gt;f(x{+}1) = f(x) + a&lt;/math&gt;. Negative slope ''a'' indicates a decrease in ''y'' for each increase in ''x''.

For example, the linear function &lt;math&gt;y = -2x + 4&lt;/math&gt; has slope &lt;math&gt;a=-2&lt;/math&gt;, ''y''-intercept point &lt;math&gt;(0,b)=(0,4)&lt;/math&gt;, and ''x''-intercept point &lt;math&gt;(2,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
Suppose salami and sausage cost €6 and €3 per kilogram, and we wish to buy €12 worth. How much of each can we purchase? Letting ''x'' and ''y'' be the weights of salami and sausage, the total cost is: &lt;math&gt;6x + 3y = 12&lt;/math&gt;. Solving for ''y'' gives the point-slope form &lt;math&gt;y = -2x + 4&lt;/math&gt;, as above. That is, if we first choose the amount of salami ''x'', the amount of sausage can be computed as a function &lt;math&gt;y = f(x) = -2x + 4&lt;/math&gt;. Since salami costs twice as much as sausage, adding one kilo of salami decreases the sausage by 2 kilos: &lt;math&gt;f(x{+}1) = f(x) - 2&lt;/math&gt;, and the slope is &amp;minus;2. The ''y''-intercept point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(0,4)&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to buying only 4kg of sausage; while the ''x''-intercept point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(2,0)&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to buying only 2kg of salami. 

Note that the graph includes points with negative values of ''x'' or ''y'', which have no meaning in terms of the original variables (unless we imagine selling meat to the butcher). Thus we should restrict our function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; to the domain &lt;math&gt;0\le x\le 2&lt;/math&gt;. 

Also, we could choose ''y'' as the independent variable, and compute ''x'' by the [[inverse function|inverse]] linear function: &lt;math&gt;x = g(y) = -\tfrac12 y +2&lt;/math&gt; over the domain &lt;math&gt;0\le y \le 4&lt;/math&gt;.

== Relationship with other classes of functions ==

If the coefficient of the variable is not zero ({{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}), then a linear function is represented by a [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] 1 [[polynomial]] (also called a ''linear polynomial''), otherwise it is a [[constant function]] – also a polynomial function, but of zero degree.

A straight line, when drawn in a different kind of coordinate system may represent other functions.

For example, it may represent an [[exponential growth|exponential function]] when its [[codomain|values]] are expressed in the [[logarithmic scale]]. It means that when {{math|[[logarithm|log]](''g''(''x''))}} is a linear function of {{mvar|x}}, the function {{mvar|g}} is exponential. With linear functions, increasing the input by one unit causes the output to increase by a fixed amount, which is the slope of the graph of the function. With exponential functions, increasing the input by one unit causes the output to increase by a fixed multiple, which is known as the base of the exponential function.

If ''both'' [[domain of a function|arguments]] and values of a function are in the logarithmic scale (i.e., when {{math|[[logarithm|log]](''y'')}} is a linear function of {{math|[[logarithm|log]](''x'')}}), then the straight line represents a [[power law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\log_r y = a \log_r x + b \quad\Rightarrow\quad y = r^b\cdot x^a&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Archimedean-Spiral.png|thumb|Archimedean spiral defined by the polar equation r = &amp;frac12;&amp;theta; + 2]]
On the other hand, the graph of a linear function in terms of [[polar coordinates]]: 
:&lt;math&gt;r =f(\theta ) = a\theta  + b&lt;/math&gt;
is an [[Archimedean spiral]] if &lt;math&gt;a \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and a [[circle]] otherwise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8682">In probability theory and related fields, '''Malliavin calculus''' is a set of mathematical techniques and ideas that extend the mathematical field of [[calculus of variations]] from  deterministic functions to [[stochastic processes]]. In particular, it allows the computation of [[derivative]]s of [[random variable]]s. Malliavin calculus is also called the '''[[stochastic calculus]] of variations'''. 

Malliavin calculus is named after [[Paul Malliavin]] whose ideas led to a proof that [[Hörmander's condition]] implies the existence and smoothness of a [[probability density function|density]] for the solution of a [[stochastic differential equation]]; [[Lars Hörmander|Hörmander]]'s original proof was based on the theory of  [[partial differential equation]]s. The calculus has been applied to [[stochastic partial differential equation]]s as well.

The calculus allows [[integration by parts]] with [[random variable]]s; this operation is used in [[mathematical finance]] to compute the sensitivities of [[derivative (finance)|financial derivative]]s. The calculus has applications in, for example, [[stochastic filtering]].

==Overview and history==
Malliavin introduced Malliavin calculus to provide a stochastic proof that [[Hörmander's condition]] implies the existence of a [[probability density function|density]] for the solution of a [[stochastic differential equation]]; [[Lars Hörmander|Hörmander]]'s original proof was based on the theory of  [[partial differential equation]]s. His calculus enabled Malliavin to prove regularity bounds for the solution's density. The calculus has been applied to [[stochastic partial differential equation]]s.

== Invariance principle ==
The usual invariance principle for [[Lebesgue integration]] over the whole real line is that, for any real number ε and integrable function ''f'', the
following holds

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\, d \lambda(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x+\varepsilon)\, d \lambda(x) &lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty f'(x)\, d \lambda(x)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be used to derive the [[integration by parts]] formula since, setting ''f'' = ''gh'', it implies

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f' \,d \lambda = \int_{-\infty}^\infty (gh)' \,d \lambda = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g h'\, d \lambda +
\int_{-\infty}^\infty g' h\, d \lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

A similar idea can be applied in stochastic analysis for the differentiation along a Cameron-Martin-Girsanov direction. Indeed, let &lt;math&gt;h_s&lt;/math&gt; be a square-integrable [[predictable process]] and set

:&lt;math&gt; \varphi(t) = \int_0^t h_s\, d s .&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Wiener process]], the [[Girsanov theorem]] then yields the following analogue of the invariance principle:

:&lt;math&gt; E(F(X + \varepsilon\varphi))= E \left [F(X) \exp \left ( \varepsilon\int_0^1 h_s\, d X_s -
\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon^2 \int_0^1 h_s^2\, ds \right ) \right ].&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating with respect to ε on both sides and evaluating at ε=0, one obtains the following integration by parts formula:

:&lt;math&gt;E(\langle DF(X), \varphi\rangle) = E\Bigl[ F(X) \int_0^1 h_s\, dX_s\Bigr].
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the left-hand side is the [[Malliavin derivative]] of the random variable &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in the direction &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and the integral appearing on the right hand side should be interpreted as an [[Itô integral]]. This expression also remains true (by definition) if &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is not adapted, provided that the right hand side is interpreted as a [[Skorokhod integral]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

One of the most useful results from Malliavin calculus is the [[Clark-Ocone theorem]], which allows the process in the [[martingale representation theorem]] to be identified explicitly. A simplified version of this theorem is as follows:

For &lt;math&gt;F: C[0,1] \to \R&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt; E(F(X)^2) &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; which is Lipschitz and such that ''F'' has a strong derivative kernel, in the sense that
for &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; in ''C''[0,1]

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} (1/\varepsilon)(F(X+\varepsilon \varphi) - F(X) ) = \int_0^1 F'(X,dt) \varphi(t)\ \mathrm{a.e.}\ X&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;F(X) = E(F(X)) + \int_0^1 H_t \,d X_t ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H'' is the previsible projection of ''F''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;(''x'', (''t'',1]) which may be viewed as the derivative of the function ''F'' with respect to a suitable parallel shift of the process ''X'' over the portion (''t'',1] of its domain.

This may be more concisely expressed by

:&lt;math&gt;F(X) = E(F(X))+\int_0^1 E (D_t F | \mathcal{F}_t ) \, d X_t .&lt;/math&gt;

Much of the work in the formal development of the Malliavin calculus involves extending this result to the largest possible class of functionals ''F'' by replacing the derivative kernel used above by the "[[Malliavin derivative]]" denoted &lt;math&gt;D_t&lt;/math&gt; in the above statement of the result. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

== Skorokhod integral ==
{{Main|Skorokhod integral}}
The [[Skorokhod integral]] operator which is conventionally denoted δ is defined as the adjoint of the Malliavin derivative thus for u in the domain of the operator which is a subset of &lt;math&gt;L^2([0,\infty) \times \Omega)&lt;/math&gt;,
for '''F''' in the domain of the Malliavin derivative, we require

: &lt;math&gt; E (\langle DF, u \rangle ) = E (F \delta (u) ),&lt;/math&gt;

where the inner product is that on &lt;math&gt;L^2[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; viz

: &lt;math&gt; \langle f, g \rangle = \int_0^\infty f(s) g(s) \, ds.&lt;/math&gt;

The existence of this adjoint follows from the [[Riesz representation theorem]] for linear operators on [[Hilbert spaces]].

It can be shown that if ''u'' is adapted then

: &lt;math&gt; \delta(u) = \int_0^\infty u_t\, d W_t ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is to be understood in the Itô sense.   Thus this provides a method of extending the Itô integral to non adapted integrands.

==Applications==
The calculus allows [[integration by parts]] with [[random variable]]s; this operation is used in [[mathematical finance]] to compute the sensitivities of [[derivative (finance)|financial derivative]]s. The calculus has applications for example in [[stochastic control|stochastic filtering]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1352">In mathematics, the '''max–min inequality''' is as follows:  for any function ''f'': ''Z'' × ''W'' → ℝ,
: &lt;math&gt;
\sup_{z \in Z} \inf_{w \in W} f(z, w) \leq \inf_{w \in W} \sup_{z \in Z} f(z, w).
&lt;/math&gt;

When equality holds one says that ''f'', ''W'' and ''Z'' satisfies a strong max–min property (or a [[saddle point|saddle-point]] property). As the function ''f''(''z'',''w'')=sin(''z''+''w'')  illustrates, this equality does not always hold. A theorem giving conditions on ''f'', ''W'' and ''Z'' in order to guarantee the saddle point property is called a [[minimax theorem]].

==Proof==
Define &lt;math&gt; g(z) \triangleq \inf_{w \in W} f(z, w) &lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow g(z) \leq f(z, w), \forall z \forall w &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow \sup_z g(z) \leq \sup_z f(z, w) , \forall w &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow \sup_z \inf_w f(z,w) \leq \sup_z f(z, w), \forall w &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow \sup_z \inf_w f(z,w) \leq \inf_w \sup_z f(z, w) \qquad \square&lt;/math&gt;

'''Molecular geometry''' is the [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] arrangement of the [[atom]]s that constitute a [[molecule]]. It includes the general shape of the molecule as well as [[bond length]]s, bond angles, [[torsional angle]]s and any other geometrical parameters that determine the position of each atom.

Molecular geometry influences several properties of a substance including its [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], [[Chemical polarity|polarity]], [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]], [[color]], [[magnetism]] and [[biological activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{McMurray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cotton&amp;Wilkinson6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="article0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alexandros Chremos|author2=Jack F.

== Determination ==
The molecular geometry can be determined by various [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic methods]] and [[diffraction]] methods. [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]], [[Rotational spectroscopy|microwave]] and [[Raman spectroscopy]] can give information about the molecule geometry from the details of the vibrational and rotational absorbance detected by these techniques. [[X-ray crystallography]], [[neutron diffraction]] and [[electron diffraction]] can give molecular structure for crystalline solids based on the distance between nuclei and concentration of electron density. [[Gas electron diffraction]] can be used for small molecules in the gas phase. [[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] methods can be used to determine complementary information including relative distances,&lt;!--

angles, and connectivity.  Molecular geometries are best determined at low temperature because at higher temperatures the molecular structure is averaged over more accessible geometries (see next section). Larger molecules often exist in multiple stable geometries ([[conformational isomerism]]) that are close in energy on the [[potential energy surface]].  Geometries can also be computed by [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods]] to high accuracy.  The molecular geometry can be different as a solid, in solution, and as a gas.

The position of each atom is determined by the nature of the [[chemical bond]]s by which it is connected to its neighboring atoms. The molecular geometry can be described by the positions of these atoms in space, evoking [[bond length]]s of two joined atoms, [[bond angle]]s of three connected atoms, and [[Torsion of a curve|torsion angles]] ([[dihedral angle]]s) of three [[path graph|consecutive]] bonds.

== The influence of thermal excitation ==
Since the motions of the atoms in a molecule are determined by quantum mechanics, one
must define "motion" in a quantum mechanical way. The overall (external) quantum mechanical motions translation and rotation hardly change the geometry of the molecule. (To some extent rotation influences
the geometry via [[Coriolis force]]s and [[rotational spectroscopy|centrifugal distortion]], but this is negligible for the present discussion.)
In addition to translation and rotation, a third type of motion is [[molecular vibration]], which corresponds to internal motions of the atoms such as bond stretching and bond angle variation. The molecular vibrations are [[Quantum harmonic oscillator|harmonic]] (at least to good approximation), and the atoms oscillate about their equilibrium positions, even at the absolute zero of temperature. At absolute zero all atoms are in their vibrational ground state and show [[Zero point energy|zero point quantum mechanical motion]], so that the wavefunction of a single vibrational mode is not a sharp peak, but an exponential of finite width (the wavefunction for ''n'' = 0 depicted in the article on the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]).  At higher temperatures the vibrational modes may be thermally excited (in a classical interpretation one expresses this by stating that "the molecules will vibrate faster"), but they oscillate still around the recognizable geometry of the molecule.

To get a feeling for the probability that the vibration of molecule may be thermally excited,
we inspect the [[Boltzmann distribution|Boltzmann factor]] &lt;math&gt;\beta \equiv \exp\left( -\frac{\Delta E}{kT} \right) &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; is the excitation energy of the vibrational mode, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; the [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; the absolute temperature. At 298&amp;nbsp;K (25&amp;nbsp;°C), typical values for the Boltzmann factor β are:
β = 0.089 for ΔE = 500&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ; β = 0.008 for ΔE = 1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ; β = 7×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;  for ΔE = 1500&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. (The reciprocal centimeter is an energy unit that is commonly used in [[infrared spectroscopy]];  1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; corresponds to 1.23984×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; eV). When an excitation energy is 500&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, then about 8.9 percent of the molecules are thermally excited at room temperature. To put this in perspective: the lowest excitation vibrational energy in water is the bending mode (about 1600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, at room temperature less than 0.07 percent of all the molecules of a given amount of water will vibrate faster than at absolute zero.

As stated above, rotation hardly influences the molecular geometry. But, as a quantum mechanical motion, it is thermally excited at relatively (as compared to vibration) low temperatures. From a classical point of view it can be stated that at higher temperatures more molecules will rotate faster,
which implies that they have higher [[angular velocity]] and [[angular momentum]]. In quantum mechanical language: more eigenstates of higher angular momentum become [[Boltzmann distribution|thermally populated]] with rising temperatures. Typical rotational excitation energies are on the order of a few cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The results of many spectroscopic experiments are broadened because they involve an averaging over rotational states. It is often difficult to extract geometries from spectra at high temperatures, because the number of rotational states probed in the experimental averaging increases with increasing temperature.  Thus, many spectroscopic observations can only be expected to yield reliable molecular geometries at temperatures close to absolute zero, because at higher temperatures too many higher rotational states are thermally populated.

== Bonding ==

Molecules, by definition, are most often held together with [[covalent bond]]s involving single, double, and/or triple bonds, where a "bond" is a [[shared pair]] of electrons (the other method of bonding between atoms is called [[ionic bonding]] and involves a positive [[cation]] and a negative [[anion]]).

Molecular geometries can be specified in terms of '''bond lengths''', '''bond angles''' and '''torsional angles'''. The bond length is defined to be the average distance between the nuclei of two atoms bonded together in any given molecule. A bond angle is the angle formed between three atoms across at least two bonds. For four atoms bonded together in a chain, the [[Dihedral angle|torsional angle]] is the angle between the plane formed by the first three atoms and the plane formed by the last three atoms.

There exists a mathematical relationship among the bond angles for one central atom and four peripheral atoms (labeled 1 through 4) expressed by the following determinant.  This constraint removes one degree of freedom from the choices of (originally) six free bond angles to leave only five choices of bond angles.  (Note that the angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_{11}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta_{22}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta_{33}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{44}&lt;/math&gt; are always zero and that this relationship can be modified for a different number of peripheral atoms by expanding/contracting the square matrix.)

::&lt;math&gt;0 = \begin{vmatrix}

\cos \theta_{11} &amp; \cos \theta_{12} &amp; \cos \theta_{13} &amp; \cos \theta_{14} \\
\cos \theta_{21} &amp; \cos \theta_{22} &amp; \cos \theta_{23} &amp; \cos \theta_{24} \\
\cos \theta_{31} &amp; \cos \theta_{32} &amp; \cos \theta_{33} &amp; \cos \theta_{34} \\
\cos \theta_{41} &amp; \cos \theta_{42} &amp; \cos \theta_{43} &amp; \cos \theta_{44} \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Molecular geometry is determined by the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] behavior of the electrons. Using the [[valence bond theory|valence bond approximation]] this can be understood by the type of bonds between the atoms that make up the molecule. When atoms interact to form a [[chemical bond]], the atomic orbitals of each atom are said to combine in a process called [[orbital hybridisation]].  The two most common types of bonds are [[sigma bond]]s (usually formed by hybrid orbitals) and [[pi bond]]s (formed by unhybridized p orbitals for atoms of [[main group element]]s).  The geometry can also be understood by [[molecular orbital theory]] where the electrons are delocalised.

An understanding of the wavelike behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules is the subject of [[quantum chemistry]].

== Isomers ==

[[Isomer]]s are types of molecules that share a chemical formula but have different geometries, resulting in different properties:
* A '''pure''' substance is composed of only one type of isomer of a molecule (all have the same geometrical structure).
* [[Structural isomerism|Structural isomers]] have the same chemical formula but different physical arrangements, often forming alternate molecular geometries with very different properties. The atoms are not bonded (connected) together in the same orders.
** [[Functional isomer]]s are special kinds of structural isomers, where certain groups of atoms exhibit a special kind of behavior, such as an ether or an alcohol.
* [[Stereoisomer]]s may have many similar physicochemical properties (melting point, boiling point) and at the same time very different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities. This is because they exhibit a [[handedness]] that is commonly found in living systems. One manifestation of this [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] or handedness is that they have the ability to rotate polarized light in different directions.
* [[Protein folding]] concerns the complex geometries and different isomers that [[protein]]s can take.

==Types of molecular structure==
A bond angle is the geometric angle between two adjacent bonds. Some common shapes of simple molecules include:
* '''[[Linear molecular geometry|Linear]]:''' In a linear model, atoms are connected in a straight line. The bond angles are set at 180°. For example, carbon dioxide and [[nitric oxide]] have a linear molecular shape.
* '''[[Trigonal planar molecular geometry|Trigonal planar]]:''' Molecules with the trigonal planar shape are somewhat triangular and in one [[Plane (geometry)|plane (flat)]].  Consequently, the bond angles are set at 120°. For example, [[boron trifluoride]].
* '''[[Bent molecular geometry|Angular]]:''' Angular molecules (also called ''bent'' or ''V-shaped'') have a non-linear shape. For example, water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which has an angle of about 105°. A water molecule has two pairs of bonded electrons and two unshared lone pairs.
* '''[[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|Tetrahedral]]:''' ''Tetra-'' signifies four, and ''-hedral'' relates to a face of a solid, so "[[tetrahedral]]" literally means "having four faces".  This shape is found when there are [[star (graph theory)|four bonds all on one central atom]], with no extra unshared [[electron]] pairs.  In accordance with the [[VSEPR]] (valence-shell electron pair repulsion theory), the bond angles between the electron bonds are [[Inverse trigonometric functions|arccos]](−1/3) = 109.47°. For example, [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a tetrahedral molecule. &lt;!-- what about molecules without a central atom, which form a complete graph? --&gt;
* '''[[Octahedral molecular geometry|Octahedral]]:''' ''Octa-'' signifies eight, and ''-hedral'' relates to a face of a solid, so "[[octahedral]]" means "having eight faces". The bond angle is 90 degrees. For example, [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is an octahedral molecule.
* '''[[Trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry|Trigonal pyramidal]]:''' A trigonal pyramidal molecule has a [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid-like shape]] with a triangular base.  Unlike the linear and trigonal planar shapes but similar to the tetrahedral orientation, pyramidal shapes require three dimensions in order to fully separate the electrons.  Here, there are only three pairs of bonded electrons, leaving one unshared lone pair. Lone pair – bond pair repulsions change the bond angle from the tetrahedral angle to a slightly lower value.&lt;ref&gt;Miessler G.L. and Tarr D.A. ''Inorganic Chemistry'' (2nd ed., Prentice-Hall 1999), pp.57-58&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

===VSEPR table===
{{main|VSEPR theory #AXE method}}
The bond angles in the table below are ideal angles from the simple [[VSEPR theory]], followed by the actual angle for the example given in the following column where this differs. For many cases, such as trigonal pyramidal and bent, the actual angle for the example differs from the ideal angle, and examples differ by different amounts. For example, the angle in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S (92°) differs from the tetrahedral angle by much more than the angle for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (104.48°) does.

The greater the amount of lone pairs contained in a molecule the smaller the angles between the atoms of that molecule. The [[VSEPR theory]] predicts that lone pairs repel each other, thus pushing the different atoms away from them.

The '''National Institute of Statistical Sciences''' (NISS) is an American institute that researches statistical science and quantitative analysis.  

== History ==

In 1985 the [[National Science Foundation]] funded a proposal by the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]] (IMS) to assess the status of cross-disciplinary statistical research and to make recommendations for its future. The IMS formed a panel consisted of twelve members from statistics, pure and applied mathematics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, and public affairs, including [[Ingram Olkin]] (Co-Chair), [[Jerome Sacks]] (Co-Chair), [[Alfred Blumstein]], Amos Eddy, [[Bill Eddy]], Peter C. Jurs, [[William Kruskal]], Thomas Kutz, Gary C. McDonald, Ronald Peierls, Paul Shaman, and William Spurgeon. In 1990, the panel published a report on Cross-Disciplinary Research in the Statistical Sciences &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1177012273|title=Cross-Disciplinary Research in the Statistical Sciences|author=IMS Panel on Cross-Disciplinary Research in the Statistical Sciences|journal=Statistical Science|year=1990|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1214/ss/1177012273}}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to the founding of the National Institute of Statistical Sciences.

The National Institute of Statistical Sciences was established in 1990 and located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina by  the  [[American  Statistical  Association]],  the  [[International  Biometric  Society]],  the  [[Institute  of  Mathematical  Statistics]],  [[Duke University]],  [[North  Carolina  State  University]], and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[RTI International]] (formerly Research Triangle Institute). Dan Horvitz of RTI became the interim director. [[Jerome Sacks]] became the founding director in 1991. [[Alan F. Karr]] joined NISS as the associate director in 1992 and became the director in 2000. Nell Sedransk appointed as the associate director in 2005 and became the director in 2015. James L. Rosenberger became the director of NISS in 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2010/11/01/niss20_nov201|title=The National Institute of Statistical Sciences Celebrates 20-Year Anniversary|work=AMSTAT News|date=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/2330443X.2015.1129919|title=NISS: From Vision to National Institute|first=Nell|last=Sedransk|journal=Statistics and Public Policy|year=2016|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.1080/2330443X.2015.1129919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the first NISS postdoctoral fellows joined. There are now nearly 80 of former NISS postdoctoral fellows around the world and in various organizations in each sector: academia, government, and industry. Here is a list of notable alumni:

* John Aston, Professor of Statistics at the University of Cambridge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~jada2/|title=John Aston}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adrian Dobra, Associate Professor at the University of Washington&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stat.washington.edu/adobra/index.html/|title=Adrian Dobra}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shanti Gomatam, Mathematical Statistician at U.S. Food and Drug Administration
* Murali Haran, Professor and Head of Statistics at Penn State University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.psu.edu/muh10/|title=Murali Haran}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jiming Jiang, Professor of Statistics at the University of California - Davis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~jiang/|title=Jiming Jiang}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Xiaodong Lin, Associate Professor at Rutgers Business School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.rutgers.edu/faculty/xiaodong-lin|title=Xiaodong Lin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Matthias Schonlau, Professor of Statistics at the University of Waterloo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/people-profiles/matthias-schonlau|title=Matthias Schonlau}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Minge Xie, Professor of Statistics at Rutgers University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stat.rutgers.edu/home/mxie/|title=Minge Xie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Haibo Zhou, Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/haibo-zhou-phd/|title=Haibo Zhou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the NISS affiliates program was created to address challenges arising in government and industry. In 2005, the NISS affiliates program was recognized by the [[American  Statistical Association]] with the Statistical Partnerships among Academia, Industry, and Government (SPAIG) Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.amstat.org/spaig/home|title=The Statistical Partnerships among Academia, Industry, and Government (SPAIG) Award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute]] was funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], and it was partnered with [[Duke University]], [[North Carolina State University]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], and the National Institute of Statistical Sciences.

From 2011 to 2018, the NISS and [[Duke University]] collaborated on the Triangle Census Research Network (TCRN), one of eight research nodes that worked on the National Census Research Network (NCRN). In 2017, the NCRN was recognized by the [[American  Statistical Association]] with the Statistical Partnerships among Academia, Industry, and Government (SPAIG) Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.amstat.org/spaig/home|title=The Statistical Partnerships among Academia, Industry, and Government (SPAIG) Award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2209">'''Network dynamics''' is a research field for the study of [[Network theory|networks]] whose status changes in time. The dynamics may refer to the structure of connections of the units of a network,&lt;ref name="mpbkhs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jnng"/&gt; to the collective internal state of the network,&lt;ref name="jjham"/&gt;  or both. The networked systems could be from the fields of [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[computer science]], etc. Networked systems are typically characterized as [[complex systems]] consisting of many units coupled by specific, potentially changing, interaction topologies.

For a [[dynamical systems]]' approach to discrete network dynamics, see [[sequential dynamical system]].

In mathematics, '''Newick tree format''' (or '''Newick notation''' or '''New Hampshire tree format''') is a way of representing [[graph-theoretical tree]]s with edge lengths using parentheses and commas.  It was adopted by James Archie, William H. E. Day, [[Joseph Felsenstein]], [[Wayne Maddison]], Christopher Meacham, F. James Rohlf, and David Swofford, at two meetings in 1986, the second of which was at [http://www.newicks.com/ Newick's restaurant] in [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]], New Hampshire, US. The adopted format is a generalization of the format developed by Meacham in 1984 for the first tree-drawing programs in Felsenstein's [[PHYLIP]] package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html The Newick tree format.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The following tree:

[[Image:NewickExample.svg]]

could be represented in Newick format in several ways 

 ({{Not a typo|,,}}(,));                               ''no nodes are named''
 (A,B,(C,D));                           ''leaf nodes are named''
 (A,B,(C,D)E)F;                         ''all nodes are named''
 (:0.1,:0.2,(:0.3,:0.4):0.5);           ''all but root node have a distance to parent''
 (:0.1,:0.2,(:0.3,:0.4):0.5):0.0;       ''all have a distance to parent''
 (A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4):0.5);       ''distances and leaf names'' '''(popular)'''
 (A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)F;     ''distances and all names''
 ((B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)A:0.1)F;    ''a tree rooted on a leaf node'' '''(rare)'''

Newick format is typically used for tools like [[PHYLIP]] and is a minimal definition for a [[phylogenetic tree]].

==Rooted, unrooted, and binary trees==
When an ''unrooted'' tree is represented in Newick notation, an arbitrary node is chosen as its root.  Whether rooted or unrooted, typically a tree's representation is rooted on an internal node and it is rare (but legal) to root a tree on a leaf node.  

A ''[[rooted binary tree]]'' that is rooted on an internal node has exactly two immediate descendant nodes for each internal node.
An ''unrooted binary'' tree that is rooted on an arbitrary internal node has exactly three immediate descendant nodes for the root node, and each other internal node has exactly two immediate descendant nodes.
A ''binary tree rooted from a leaf'' has at most one immediate descendant node for the root node, and each internal node has exactly two immediate descendant nodes.

==Grammar==
A grammar for parsing the Newick format:

=== The grammar nodes ===

    '''Tree''': The full input Newick Format for a single tree
    '''Subtree''': an internal node (and its descendants) or a leaf node
    '''Leaf''': a node with no descendants
    '''Internal''': a node and its one or more descendants
    '''BranchSet''': a set of one or more Branches
    '''Branch''': a tree edge and its descendant subtree.
    '''Name''': the name of a node
    '''Length''': the length of a tree edge.

=== The grammar rules ===
Note, "|" separates alternatives.

    '''Tree''' → '''Subtree''' ";" | '''Branch''' ";"
    '''Subtree''' → '''Leaf''' | '''Internal'''
    '''Leaf''' → '''Name'''
    '''Internal''' → "(" '''BranchSet''' ")" '''Name'''
    '''BranchSet''' → '''Branch''' | '''Branch''' "," '''BranchSet'''
    '''Branch''' → '''Subtree''' '''Length'''
    '''Name''' → ''empty'' | ''string''
    '''Length''' → ''empty'' | ":" ''number''

Whitespace (spaces, tabs, carriage returns, and linefeeds) within ''number'' is prohibited.  Whitespace within ''string'' is often prohibited.  Whitespace elsewhere is ignored.  Sometimes the '''Name''' ''string'' must be of a specified fixed length; otherwise the punctuation characters from the grammar (semicolon, parentheses, comma, and colon) are prohibited.  The '''Tree''' --&gt; '''Branch''' ";" production makes the entire tree descendant from nowhere, which can be nonsensical, and is sometimes prohibited.

Note that when a tree having more than one leaf is rooted from one of its leaves, a representation that is rarely seen in practice, the root leaf is characterized as an '''Internal''' node by the above grammar.  Generally, a ''root node'' labeled as '''Internal''' should be construed as a leaf if and only if it has exactly one '''Branch''' in its '''BranchSet'''.  One can make a grammar that formalizes this distinction by replacing the above '''Tree''' production rule with

    '''Tree''' → '''RootLeaf''' ";" | '''RootInternal''' ";" | '''Branch''' ";"
    '''RootLeaf''' → '''Name''' | "(" '''Branch''' ")" '''Name'''
    '''RootInternal''' → "(" '''Branch''' "," '''BranchSet''' ")" '''Name'''

The first '''RootLeaf''' production is for a tree with exactly one leaf.  The second '''RootLeaf''' production is for rooting a tree from one of its two or more leaves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1880">In [[mathematics]], the '''Ostrowski–Hadamard gap theorem''' is a result about the [[analytic continuation]] of [[complex number|complex]] [[power series]] whose non-zero terms are of orders that have a suitable "gap" between them. Such a power series is "badly behaved" in the sense that it cannot be extended to be an [[analytic function]] anywhere on the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of its [[radius of convergence|disc of convergence]]. The result is named after the [[mathematician]]s [[Alexander Ostrowski]] and [[Jacques Hadamard]].

==Statement of the theorem==

Let 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;... be a [[sequence]] of [[integer]]s such that, for some ''&amp;lambda;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1 and all ''j''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N''',

{{Financial markets}}

'''Over-the-counter''' ('''OTC''') or '''off-exchange''' trading is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an [[exchange (organized market)|exchange]]. It is contrasted with [[exchange trading]], which occurs via exchanges. A stock exchange has the benefit of facilitating [[liquidity]], providing [[transparency (market)|transparency]], and maintaining the current [[market price]]. In an OTC trade, the price is not necessarily published for the public.

OTC trading, as well as exchange trading, occurs with [[commodities]], [[financial instrument]]s (including [[stock]]s), and [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] of such products. Products traded on the exchange must be well standardized.  This means that exchanged deliverables match a narrow range of quantity, quality, and identity which is defined by the exchange and identical to all transactions of that product.  This is necessary for there to be transparency in trading. The OTC market does not have this limitation. They may agree on an unusual quantity, for example.&lt;small&gt;'''{{Sfn|McCrank|2014}}'''&lt;/small&gt; In OTC, market contracts are bilateral (i.e. the contract is only between two parties), and each party could have credit risk concerns with respect to the other party. The OTC derivative market is significant in some asset classes: [[interest rate]], [[Exchange rate|foreign exchange]], [[stock]]s, and [[commodities]].{{Sfn|Gregory|2011|page=7}}

In 2008 approximately 16 percent of all U.S. stock trades were "off-exchange trading"; by April 2014 that number increased to about 40 percent.{{Sfn|McCrank|2014}} Although the notional amount outstanding of OTC derivatives in late 2012 had declined 3.3% over the previous year, the volume of cleared transactions at the end of 2012 totalled US$346.4 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]].{{Sfn|ISDA|2013}} "The [[Bank for International Settlements]] statistics on OTC derivatives markets showed that notional amounts outstanding totalled $693 trillion at the end of June 2013... The gross market value of OTC derivatives – that is, the cost of replacing all outstanding contracts at current market prices – declined between end-2012 and end-June 2013, from $25 trillion to $20 trillion."{{Sfn|Bank for International Settlements (BIS)|2013}}

== Stocks ==

In the United States, over-the-counter trading in stock is carried out by [[market maker]]s using inter-dealer quotation services such as OTC Link (a service offered by [[OTC Markets Group]]) and the [[OTC Bulletin Board]] (OTCBB, operated by [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|FINRA]]). The OTCBB licenses the services of OTC Link for their OTCBB securities. Although exchange-listed stocks can be traded OTC on the [[third market trading|third market]], it is rarely the case. Usually OTC stocks are not listed nor traded on exchanges, and vice versa.  Stocks quoted on the OTCBB must comply with certain limited [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) reporting requirements.  The SEC imposes more stringent financial and reporting requirements on other OTC stocks, specifically the [[OTCQX]] stocks (traded through the OTC Market Group Inc). Other OTC stocks have no reporting requirements, for example [[Pink Sheets LLC|Pink Sheets]] securities and "gray market" stocks.

Some companies, with Wal-Mart as one of the largest,{{Sfn|Better Trades|2012}} began trading as OTC stocks and eventually upgraded to a listing on fully regulated market. By 1969 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. was incorporated. In 1972, with stores in five states, including Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Missouri, Wal-Mart began trading as over-the-counter (OTC) stocks. By 1972 Walmart had earned over US$1 billion in sales — the fastest company to ever accomplish this. In 1972 Wal-Mart was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol WMT.{{Sfn|Better Trades|2012}}

== Contracts ==

An over-the-counter is a [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] contract in which two parties (or their brokers or bankers as intermediaries) agree on how a particular trade or agreement is to be settled in the future. It is usually from an investment bank to its clients directly. [[Forward contract|Forwards]] and [[Swap (finance)|swaps]] are prime examples of such contracts. It is mostly done online or by telephone. For [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], these agreements are usually governed by an [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] agreement. This segment of the OTC market is occasionally referred to as the "[[fourth market|Fourth Market]]." Critics have labelled the OTC market as the "dark market" because prices are often unpublished and unregulated.{{Sfn|McCrank|2014}}

Over-the-counter derivatives are especially important for hedging risk in that they can be used to create a "perfect hedge." With exchange traded contracts, standardization does not allow for as much flexibility to hedge risk because the contract is a one-size-fits-all instrument. With OTC derivatives, though, a firm can tailor the contract specifications to best suit its risk exposure.&lt;ref&gt;http://chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/understanding_derivatives/understanding_derivatives_chapter_3_over_the_counter_derivatives.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counterparty risk ==

OTC derivatives can lead to significant risks. Especially [[counterparty risk]] has gained particular emphasis due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|credit crisis in 2007]]. Counterparty risk is the risk that a counterparty in a derivatives transaction will [[default (finance)|default]] prior to expiration of the trade and will not make the current and future payments required by the contract.{{Sfn|Gregory|2011|page=17}} There are many ways to limit counterparty risk. One of them focuses on controlling credit exposure with [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]], [[netting]], [[Collateral (finance)|collateralisation]] and [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]].{{Sfn|Gregory|2011|page=25}}  [[Central counterparty clearing]] of OTC trades has become more common in recent years, with regulators placing pressure on the OTC markets to clear and display trades openly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fixglobal.com/home/otc-clearing-fixed-up-2/ OTC Clearing 'FIX'ed Up]. FIXGlobal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/ice_trust/Global%2520Investor%2520Magazine.pdf A Focus on OTC Clearing Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929171350/https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/ice_trust/Global%20Investor%20Magazine.pdf |date=2011-09-29 }}. [[Intercontinental Exchange]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In their market review published in 2010 the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] &lt;ref group=Notes&gt;ISDA 2012 Market Analysis drew on "information sources including [[LCH.Clearnet|LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear]], TriOptima, the [[Trade Information Warehouse|DTCC Trade Information Warehouse]], [[Markit]], [[Intercontinental Exchange|ICE]], [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange|CME]], ISDA’s 2012 Margin Survey and other clearinghouses and trade vendors."&lt;/ref&gt; examined OTC Derivative Bilateral Collateralization Practice as one way of mitigating risk.{{Sfn|International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)|2010}}

== Importance of OTC derivatives in modern banking ==

OTC derivatives are significant part of the world of global finance. The OTC derivatives markets grew exponentially from 1980 through 2000. This expansion has been driven by interest rate products, foreign exchange instruments and credit default swaps. The notional outstanding of OTC derivatives markets rose throughout the period and totalled approximately US$601 trillion at December 31, 2010.{{Sfn|International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)|2010}}

In their 2000 paper by Schinasi et al. published by the [[International Monetary Fund]] in 2001, the authors observed that the increase in OTC derivatives transactions would have been impossible "without the dramatic advances in information and computer technologies" that occurred from 1980 to 2000.{{Sfn|Schinasi|Craig|Drees|Kramer|2001|pages=5–7}} During that time, major internationally active financial institutions significantly increased the share of their earnings from derivatives activities. These institutions manage portfolios of derivatives involving tens of thousands of positions and aggregate global turnover over $1 trillion. At that time prior to the financial crisis of 2008, the OTC market was an informal network of bilateral counterparty relationships and dynamic, time-varying credit exposures whose size and distribution tied to important asset markets. International financial institutions increasingly nurtured the ability to profit from OTC derivatives activities and financial markets participants benefitted from them. In 2000 the authors acknowledged that the growth in OTC transactions "in many ways made possible, the modernization of commercial and investment banking and the globalization of finance."{{Sfn|Schinasi|Craig|Drees|Kramer|2001|pages=5–7}} However, in September, an IMF team led by Mathieson and Schinasi cautioned that "episodes of turbulence" in the late 1990s "revealed the risks posed to market stability originated in features of OTC derivatives instruments and markets.{{Sfn|Mathieson|Schinasi|2000|page=3}}

The [[NYMEX]] has created a clearing mechanism for a slate of commonly traded OTC energy derivatives which allows counterparties of many bilateral OTC transactions to mutually agree to transfer the trade to ClearPort, the exchange's clearing house, thus eliminating credit and performance risk of the initial OTC transaction counterparts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5639">In [[mathematics]], the '''packing dimension''' is one of a number of concepts that can be used to define the [[dimension]] of a [[subset]] of a [[metric space]].  Packing dimension is in some sense [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to [[Hausdorff dimension]], since packing dimension is constructed by "packing" small [[open ball]]s inside the given subset, whereas Hausdorff dimension is constructed by covering the given subset by such small open balls. The '''packing dimension''' was introduced by C. Tricot Jr. in 1982.

==Definitions==

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') be a metric space with a subset ''S''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''X'' and let ''s''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0.  The ''s'''''-dimensional packing pre-measure''' of ''S'' is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;P_0^s (S) = \limsup_{\delta \downarrow 0}\left\{ \left. \sum_{i \in I} \mathrm{diam} (B_i)^s \right| \begin{matrix} \{ B_i \}_{i \in I} \text{ is a countable collection} \\ \text{of pairwise disjoint closed balls with} \\ \text{diameters } \leq \delta \text{ and centres in } S \end{matrix} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Unfortunately, this is just a [[pre-measure]] and not a true [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on subsets of ''X'', as can be seen by considering [[dense set|dense]], [[countable set|countable]] subsets.  However, the pre-measure leads to a ''bona fide'' measure: the ''s'''''-dimensional packing measure''' of ''S'' is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;P^s (S) = \inf \left\{ \left. \sum_{j \in J} P_0^s (S_j) \right| S \subseteq \bigcup_{j \in J} S_j, J \text{ countable} \right\},&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., the packing measure of ''S'' is the [[infimum]] of the packing pre-measures of countable covers of ''S''.

Having done this, the '''packing dimension''' dim&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') of ''S'' is defined analogously to the Hausdorff dimension:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dim_{\mathrm{P}} (S) &amp;{}  = \sup \{ s \geq 0 | P^s (S) = + \infty \} \\
&amp;{} = \inf \{ s \geq 0 | P^s (S) = 0 \}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===An example===
The following example is the simplest situation where Hausdorff and packing dimensions may differ.

Fix a sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a_0=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;a_{n+1}&lt;a_n/2&lt;/math&gt;. Define inductively a nested sequence &lt;math&gt;E_0 \supset E_1 \supset E_2 \supset \cdots&lt;/math&gt; of compact subsets of the real line as follows: Let &lt;math&gt;E_0=[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. For each connected component of &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; (which will necessarily be an interval of length &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;), delete the middle interval of length &lt;math&gt;a_n - 2a_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, obtaining two intervals of length &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, which will be taken as connected components of &lt;math&gt;E_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. Next, define &lt;math&gt;K = \bigcap_n E_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is topologically a Cantor set (i.e., a compact totally disconnected perfect space). For example, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; will be the usual middle-thirds Cantor set if &lt;math&gt;a_n=3^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is possible to show that the Hausdorff and the packing dimensions of the set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are given respectively by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dim_{\mathrm{H}} (K) &amp;{}  = \liminf_{n\to\infty} \frac{n \log 2}{- \log a_n} \, , \\
\dim_{\mathrm{P}} (K) &amp;{}  = \limsup_{n\to\infty} \frac{n \log 2}{- \log a_n} \, .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows easily that given numbers &lt;math&gt;0 \leq d_1 \leq d_2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, one can choose a sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; as above such that the associated (topological) Cantor set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has Hausdorff dimension &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; and packing dimension &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Generalizations===

One can consider [[dimension function]]s more general than "diameter to the ''s''": for any function ''h''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞], let the '''packing pre-measure of''' ''S'' '''with dimension function''' ''h'' be given by

:&lt;math&gt;P_0^h (S) = \lim_{\delta \downarrow 0} \sup \left\{ \left. \sum_{i \in I} h \big( \mathrm{diam} (B_i) \big) \right| \begin{matrix} \{ B_{i} \}_{i \in I} \text{ is a countable collection} \\ \text{of pairwise disjoint balls with} \\ \text{diameters } \leq \delta \text{ and centres in } S \end{matrix} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

and define the '''packing measure of''' ''S'' '''with dimension function''' ''h'' by

:&lt;math&gt;P^h (S) = \inf \left\{ \left. \sum_{j \in J} P_0^h (S_j) \right| S \subseteq \bigcup_{j \in J} S_j, J \text{ countable} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''h'' is said to be an '''exact''' ('''packing''') '''dimension function''' for ''S'' if ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;(''S'') is both finite and strictly positive.

==Properties==
* If ''S'' is a subset of ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with its usual metric, then the packing dimension of ''S'' is equal to the upper modified box dimension of ''S'':

::&lt;math&gt;\dim_{\mathrm{P}} (S) = \overline{\dim}_\mathrm{MB} (S).&lt;/math&gt;

:This result is interesting because it shows how a dimension derived from a measure (packing dimension) agrees with one derived without using a measure (the modified box dimension).

Note, however, that the packing dimension is ''not'' equal to the box dimension.  For example, the set of [[rational number|rationals]] '''Q''' has box dimension one and packing dimension zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">In [[combinatorial game theory]], a game is '''partisan''' if it is not [[impartial game|impartial]].

Most games are partisan. For example, in [[chess]], only one player can move the white pieces. More strongly, when analyzed using combinatorial game theory, many chess positions have values that cannot be expressed as the value of an impartial game, for instance when one side has a number of extra tempos that can be used to put the other side into [[zugzwang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Partisan games are more difficult to analyze than [[impartial game]]s, as the [[Sprague–Grundy theorem]] does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;That is, not every position in a partisan game can have a [[nimber]] as its value, or else the game would be impartial. However, some nimbers can still occur as the values of game positions; see e.g. {{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2419">In the field of [[ordinary differential equation]]s, the '''Picone identity''', named after [[Mauro Picone]],&lt;ref name="Picone"&gt;{{harvnb|Picone|1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a classical result about [[homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]] linear second order differential equations. Since its inception in 1910 it has been used with tremendous success in association with an almost immediate proof of the [[Sturm comparison theorem]], a theorem whose proof took up many pages in Sturm's original memoir of 1836. It is also useful in studying the [[oscillation (differential equation)|oscillation]] of such equations and has been generalized to other type of [[differential equation]]s and [[difference equation]]s.

The Picone identity is used to prove the [[Sturm comparison theorem]] (see also [[Sturm–Picone comparison theorem]]).

== Picone identity ==
Suppose that ''u'' and ''v'' are solutions of the two homogeneous linear second order differential equations in [[self-adjoint form]]
:&lt;math&gt;(p_1(x) u')' + q_1(x) u = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(p_2(x) v')' + q_2(x) v = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
Then, for all ''x'' with ''v''(''x'') ≠ 0, the following identity holds
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{u}{v}(p_1 u' v - p_2 u v')\right)' = \left(q_2 - q_1\right) u^2 + \left(p_1 - p_2\right)u'^2 + p_2\left(u'-v'\frac{u}{v}\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof ===

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{u}{v}(p_1 u' v - p_2 u v')\right)' 
= p_1u'^2-p_2\frac {u'} v u v'-p_1\frac {u v' u'}{v}+p_2\frac {u^2 v'^2}{v^2} 
+ \frac u v (p_1u')'v+p_1\frac{u u' v '}v-\frac u v (p_2 v')'u - p_2\frac{u v' u'} v =&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= p_1u'^2-p_2u'^2+p_2u'^2-2p_2\frac u v u' v'+p_2\frac{u^2}{v^2}v'^2-\frac u v (q_1u)v+\frac u v (q_2 v)u 
= \left(p_1 - p_2\right)u'^2 + p_2\left(u'-v'\frac{u}{v}\right)^2 + \left(q_2 - q_1\right) u^2&lt;/math&gt;

'''Project SEED''' is a [[mathematics education]] program which works in school districts across the [[United States]].  Project SEED is a [[nonprofit organization]] that works in partnership with school districts, universities, foundations, and corporations to teach advanced math to elementary and middle school students as a supplement to their regular math instruction. Project SEED also provides professional development for classroom teachers. Founded in 1963 by William F. Johntz, its primary goal is to use mathematics to increase the educational options of low-achieving, at-risk students.

== About ==
Project SEED is primarily a mathematics instruction program delivered to intact classes of elementary and middle school students, many from low-income backgrounds, to better prepare them for high school and college math. SEED Instruction utilizes the [[Socratic method]], in which instructors use a question-and-answer approach to guide students to the discovery of mathematical principles. 

The SEED instructors are math subject specialists, with degrees in mathematics or math-based sciences, who use a variety of techniques including hand and arm signals to encourage high levels of involvement, focus and feedback from students of all achievement levels. The approach is intended to encourage active student learning, develop critical thinking, and strengthen articulation skills. The program also emphasizes assessment of student learning and adaptation of instruction to accommodate different math ability levels.&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;Phillips, S. &amp; Ebrahimi, H. (1993).  Equation for success:  Project SEED.  In G. Cuevas &amp; M. Driscoll (Eds.), Reaching All Students with Mathematics (pp. 59–74).  Reston, Virginia: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Project SEED curriculum includes topics from advanced mathematics, such as advanced algebra, [[pre-calculus]], [[group theory]], [[number theory]], [[calculus]], and [[geometry]]. SEED instruction is supplemental to the regular math program. While teaching students, Project SEED Mathematics Specialists simultaneously provide professional development training for classroom teachers, through modeling and coaching in its instructional strategies.

== History ==
Founded by math teacher and psychologist William Johntz in 1963 to improve the educational outcomes of low-income and minority students, Project SEED is currently run by CEO and National Director Hamid Ebrahimi, and continues to provide direct instruction and professional development for students and teachers across the U.S.

Project SEED started as a result of Johntz teaching a remedial math class at [[Berkeley High School (Berkeley, California)]] in 1963. Frustrated by the failure of standard remediation to improve the basic math skills of his students, he began teaching them algebra using a Socratic, question-and-answer technique. They responded well to this new material that allowed them to think conceptually about mathematics, but since they were already in high school, there was little time left for them to turn around their academic careers.

Johntz began using his free periods to try the same strategies to teach Algebra in a nearby elementary school. These fifth and sixth graders responded with enthusiasm to succeeding in the study of a high school subject.  Also, this exploration of advanced concepts gave Johntz a chance to revisit and reinforce the grade-level curriculum.&lt;ref name="Hollins"&gt;Hollins, E., Smiler, H., &amp; Spencer, K. (1994). Benchmarks in meeting the challenges of effective schooling for African American youngsters.  In E. Hollins, J. King, &amp; Hayman, W. (Eds.), Teaching diverse populations:  Formulating a knowledge base (pp.&amp;nbsp;166–174).  Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduate students and faculty from [[U.C. Berkeley]] soon joined Johntz in other Berkeley schools. The program spread through presentations for school districts, corporations and conferences, and became a component of the Miller Mathematics Improvement Program, a program funded statewide in California from 1968 to 1970.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, S. M. (2003). California dreaming: Reforming mathematics education. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the early instructors were university faculty, graduate students, and corporate volunteers.
Project SEED became a non-profit, tax-exempt corporation in Michigan in 1970 where state funding brought the program to ten different cities between 1970 and 1975.  When it was founded in 1963, the name Project S.E.E.D. was an acronym for “Special Elementary Education for the Disadvantaged.” The program was reincorporated in California in 1987 as Project SEED, Inc. dropping the acronym. This was done primarily to avoid confusion with “[[Special Education]]” which had taken on a specific meaning.

Over the years Project SEED has operated in a number of cities and states with funding from state governments, federal grants, school districts, and foundations and corporations. From 1982 through 2002, a district funded program in Dallas, Texas reached tens of thousands of students and hundreds of teachers in dozens of schools. The series of longitudinal studies done by the district evaluation department during that time constitutes the most thorough examination of the effectiveness of Project SEED. Students in identified schools received a semester of Project SEED instruction for three consecutive years beginning in the fourth grade, a program design that is now regarded as the preferred model. District teachers working in kindergarten through twelfth grade classrooms received workshops, in-class modeling, and coaching from SEED staff as a part of the Urban Systemic Initiative that was implemented in the Dallas &amp; Detroit school districts in the mid 1990s. The current Project SEED professional development program is based on this model. The Dallas &amp; Detroit experiences continue to inform much of what Project SEED is today.

Hundreds of articles about Project SEED have appeared in newspapers and magazines as well as a number of academic books about successful intervention programs. Many former SEED instructors have gone on to make further important contributions to the field of mathematics education.&lt;ref name="Warfield"&gt;Warfield, V. M. (n.d.). The impact of a SEED project. Retrieved from http://www.math.washington.edu/~warfield/article.html on 2011-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Project SEED operates programs in California, Michigan, Indiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Washington state.

== Evaluation and Recognition ==
Longitudinal evaluations over a number of years in different locations with different instructors demonstrate that:  Project SEED instruction has a positive impact on immediate mathematics achievement scores, Project SEED instruction has a long-term impact on mathematics achievement, and Project SEED students take more high-level mathematics courses in secondary schools.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;Webster, W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2225">In [[statistics]], the '''pseudomedian''' is a measure of [[central tendency|centrality]] for data-sets and populations defined as the median of all of the midpoints of pairs of observations. It agrees with the [[median (statistics)|median]] for symmetric data-sets or populations. In [[mathematical statistics]], the pseudomedian is also a [[location parameter]] for [[probability distribution]]s.

==Description==
In [[descriptive statistics]], the pseudomedian of a data-set is measure of centrality, similar to a [[median (statistics)|sample median]]. Other centrality statistics include the [[sample mean]] and a [[mode (statistics)|mode]]. 

In [[inferential statistics]], the pseudomedian of a finite populations is the location parameter computed by the  [[Hodges–Lehmann estimator|Hodges–Lehmann statistic]].  It coincides with a population median when the population is [[symmetric probability distribution|symmetric]]. 

In the [[statistical theory]] of probability distributions, the '''pseudomedian''' is the location parameter that is estimated by Hodges–Lehmann statistic.  When the distribution is symmetric about a median, its pseudomedian coincides with that median. For nonsymmetric distributions, the pseudomedian is defined as the [[median]] of all of the midpoints of pairs of observations. Like the set of medians, the pseudomedian is well defined for all probability distributions, even for the many distributions that lack modes or means.

==Pseudomedian filter in Signal Processing==
In [[Signal Processing]] there is another definition of '''pseudomedian filter''' for discrete signal. For a window of width 2N+1 pseudomedian defined as the average of the maximum of the minima and the minimum of the maxima of the N+1 sliding subwindows of length N+1.&lt;ref&gt;W. Pratt, T. Cooper, and I. Kabir. Pseudomedian filter. Architectures and Algorithms for Digital Image Processing II, pages 34– 43. Proc. SPIE 534, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4337">In [[systems theory]], a '''realization''' of a [[State space (controls)|state space]] model is an  implementation of a given input-output behavior.  That is, given an input-output relationship, a realization is a quadruple of ([[time-variant system|time-varying]]) [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] &lt;math&gt;[A(t),B(t),C(t),D(t)]&lt;/math&gt; such that
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + B(t) \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + D(t) \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;(u(t),y(t))&lt;/math&gt; describing the input and output of the system at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

==LTI System==
For a [[linear time-invariant system]] specified by a [[transfer function|transfer matrix]], &lt;math&gt; H(s) &lt;/math&gt;, a realization is any quadruple of matrices &lt;math&gt; (A,B,C,D) &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; H(s) = C(sI-A)^{-1}B+D&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Canonical realizations ===
Any given transfer function which is [[strictly proper]] can easily be transferred into state-space by the following approach (this example is for a 4-dimensional, single-input, single-output system)):

Given a transfer function, expand it to reveal all coefficients in both the numerator and denominator. This should result in the following form:
:&lt;math&gt; H(s) = \frac{n_{1}s^{3} + n_{2}s^{2} + n_{3}s + n_{4}}{s^{4} + d_{1}s^{3} + d_{2}s^{2} + d_{3}s + d_{4}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The coefficients can now be inserted directly into the state-space model by the following approach:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
                               -d_{1}&amp; -d_{2}&amp; -d_{3}&amp; -d_{4}\\
                                1&amp;      0&amp;      0&amp;      0\\
                                0&amp;      1&amp;      0&amp;      0\\
                                0&amp;      0&amp;      1&amp;      0
                             \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + 
                             \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0\\ 0\\ 0\\ \end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} n_{1}&amp; n_{2}&amp; n_{3}&amp; n_{4} \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

This state-space realization is called '''controllable canonical form''' (also known as phase variable canonical form) because the resulting model is guaranteed to be [[Controllability|controllable]] (i.e., because the control enters a chain of integrators, it has the ability to move every state).

The transfer function coefficients can also be used to construct another type of canonical form
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
                               -d_{1}&amp;   1&amp;  0&amp;  0\\
                               -d_{2}&amp;   0&amp;  1&amp;  0\\
                               -d_{3}&amp;   0&amp;  0&amp;  1\\
                               -d_{4}&amp;   0&amp;  0&amp;  0
                             \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + 
                             \begin{bmatrix} n_{1}\\ n_{2}\\ n_{3}\\ n_{4} \end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

This state-space realization is called '''observable canonical form''' because the resulting model is guaranteed to be [[Observability|observable]] (i.e., because the output exits from a chain of integrators, every state has an effect on the output).

==General System==
=== ''D'' = 0===
If we have an input &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;, an output &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and a [[weighting pattern]] &lt;math&gt;T(t,\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; then a realization is any triple of matrices &lt;math&gt;[A(t),B(t),C(t)]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T(t,\sigma) = C(t) \phi(t,\sigma) B(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[state-transition matrix]] associated with the realization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roger W.|last=Brockett|title=Finite Dimensional Linear Systems|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1970|isbn=978-0-471-10585-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System identification==
{{main|System identification}}
System identification techniques take the experimental data from a system and output a realization.  Such techniques can utilize both input and output data (e.g. [[eigensystem realization algorithm]]) or can only include the output data (e.g. [[frequency domain decomposition]]).  Typically an input-output technique would be more accurate, but the input data is not always available.

The '''reprojection error''' is a geometric error corresponding to the image distance between a projected point and a measured one. It is used to quantify how closely an estimate of a 3D point &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{X}}&lt;/math&gt; recreates the point's true projection &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;. More precisely, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[camera matrix|projection matrix]] of a [[pinhole camera|camera]] and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt; be the image projection of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{X}}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{P} \, \hat{\mathbf{X}}&lt;/math&gt;. The reprojection error of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{X}}&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;d(\mathbf{x}, \, \hat{\mathbf{x}})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d(\mathbf{x}, \, \hat{\mathbf{x}})&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Euclidean distance]] between the image points represented by vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Minimizing the reprojection error can be used for estimating the error from point correspondences between two images. Suppose we are given 2D to 2D point imperfect correspondences &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{x_i} \leftrightarrow \mathbf{x_i}'\}&lt;/math&gt;. We wish to find a [[homography (computer vision)|homography]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{H}}&lt;/math&gt; and pairs of perfectly matched points &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{x_i}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{x}}_i'&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. points that satisfy &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{x_i}}' = \hat{H}\mathbf{\hat{x}_i}&lt;/math&gt; that minimize the reprojection error function given by
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_i d(\mathbf{x_i}, \hat{\mathbf{x_i}})^2 + d(\mathbf{x_i}', \hat{\mathbf{x_i}}')^2&lt;/math&gt;
So the correspondences can be interpreted as imperfect images of a world point and the reprojection error quantifies their deviation from the true image projections &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{x_i}}, \hat{\mathbf{x_i}}'&lt;/math&gt;

Cambridge University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-521-83449-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a group of meta-level [[heuristics]], developed primarily in the Mathematical Reasoning Group in the School of Informatics at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and most commonly used to guide [[Mathematical Induction|inductive proofs]] in [[Automated theorem prover|automated theorem proving systems]]. Rippling may be viewed as a restricted form of [[rewrite system]], where special object level annotations are used to ensure fertilization upon the completion of rewriting, with a measure decreasing requirement ensuring termination for any set of rewrite rules and expression.

==History==
Raymond Aubin was the first person to use the term "rippling out" whilst working on his 1976 PhD thesis &lt;ref&gt;{{ citation | last = Aubin | first = Raymond | title = Mechanizing Structural Induction | publisher = University of Edinburgh |  series = EDI-INF-PHD | volume = 76-002 | url = http://hdl.handle.net/1842/6649 | year = 1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Edinburgh. He recognised a common pattern of movement during the rewriting stage of inductive proofs. [[Alan Bundy]] later turned this concept on its head by defining rippling to be this pattern of movement, rather than a side effect.

Since then, "rippling sideways", "rippling in" and "rippling past" were coined, so the term was generalised to rippling. Rippling continues to be developed at Edinburgh, and elsewhere, to this day.

Rippling has been applied to many problems traditionally viewed as being hard in the inductive theorem proving community, including [[Woody_Bledsoe|Bledsoe]]'s limit theorems and a proof of the Gordon microprocessor, a miniature computer developed by Mike Gordon and his team at Cambridge.

==Overview==
Very often, when attempting to prove a proposition, we are given a source expression and a target expression, which differ only by the inclusion of a few extra syntactic elements.

This is especially true in inductive [[Mathematical proof|proofs]], where the given expression is taken to be the [[inductive hypothesis]], and the target expression the inductive conclusion. Usually, the differences between the hypothesis and conclusion are only minor, perhaps the inclusion of a successor function (e.g., +1) around the induction variable.

At the start of rippling the differences between the two expressions, known as wave-fronts in rippling parlance, are identified. Typically these differences prevent the completion of the proof and need to be "moved away". The target expression is annotated to distinguish the wavefronts (differences) and skeleton (common structure) between the two expressions. Special rules, called wave rules, can then be used in a [[termination proof|terminating]] fashion to manipulate the target expression until the source expression can be used to complete the proof.

==Example==
We aim to show that the addition of [[natural numbers]] is [[commutativity|commutative]].  This is an elementary property, and the proof is by routine induction.  Nevertheless, the search space for finding such a proof may become quite large.

Typically, the base case of any inductive proof is solved by methods other than rippling.  For this reason, we will concentrate on the step case.
Our step case takes the following form, where we have chosen to use x as the induction variable:

[[File:Rippling step case.png]]

We may also possess several rewrite rules, drawn from lemmas, inductive definitions or elsewhere, that can be used to form wave-rules.
Suppose we have the following three rewrite rules:

[[File:Rippling rewrite rules.png]]

then these can be annotated, to form:

[[File:Rippling wave rules.png]]

Note that all these annotated rules preserve the skeleton (x + y = y + x, in the first case and x + y in the second/third).  Now, annotating the inductive step case, gives us:

[[File:Rippling annotated step case.png]]

And we are all set to perform rippling:

[[File:Rippling ripple.png]]

Note, the final rewrite causes all wave-fronts to disappear, and we may now apply fertilization, the application of the inductive hypotheses, to complete the proof.

In [[logic]], especially as applied in [[mathematics]], concept {{mvar|A}} is a '''special case''' or [[Specialization (logic)|specialization]] of concept {{mvar|B}} precisely if every instance of {{mvar|A}} is also an instance of {{mvar|B}} but not vice versa, or equivalently, if {{mvar|B}} is a [[generalization]] of {{mvar|A}}. A [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] is a type of special case which is arrived at by taking some aspect of the concept to the extreme of what is permitted in the general case. A [[degenerate case]] is a special case which is in some way qualitatively different from almost all of the cases allowed.

Special case examples include the following:
* All squares are rectangles (but not all rectangles are squares); therefore the square is a special case of the rectangle.  
* [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], that {{mvar|a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} c&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;}} has no solutions in positive integers with {{mvar|n &gt; 2}}, is a special case of [[Beal's conjecture]], that {{mvar|a&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; + b&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} c&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;}} has no primitive solutions in positive integers with {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} all greater than 2, specifically, the case of {{mvar|x {{=}} y {{=}} z}}.

In mathematics, in the [[topology]] of [[3-manifold]]s, the '''sphere theorem''' of {{harvs|txt|last=Papakyriakopoulos|first=Christos|authorlink=Christos Papakyriakopoulos|year=1957}} gives conditions for elements of the second homotopy group of a 3-manifold to be represented by embedded spheres.

One example is the following:

Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be an [[orientable]] 3-manifold such that &lt;math&gt;\pi_2(M)&lt;/math&gt; is not the trivial group.  Then there exists a non-zero element of &lt;math&gt;\pi_2(M)&lt;/math&gt; having a representative that is an [[embedding]] &lt;math&gt;S^2\to M&lt;/math&gt;.

The proof of this version of the theorem can be based on [[transversality theorem|transversality]] methods, see {{harvs|txt|last=Batude|first=Jean-Loïc|year=1971}}.

Another more general version (also called the projective plane theorem, and due to [[David B. A. Epstein]]) is:

Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be any 3-manifold and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; a &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(M)&lt;/math&gt;-[[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\pi_2(M)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f\colon S^2\to M&lt;/math&gt; is a [[general position]] map such that &lt;math&gt;[f]\notin N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is any neighborhood of the singular set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma(f)&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a map &lt;math&gt;g\colon S^2\to M&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

#&lt;math&gt;[g]\notin N&lt;/math&gt;,
#&lt;math&gt;g(S^2)\subset f(S^2)\cup U&lt;/math&gt;,
#&lt;math&gt;g\colon S^2\to g(S^2)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[covering map]], and 
#&lt;math&gt;g(S^2)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[2-sided]] submanifold ([[2-sphere]] or [[projective plane]]) of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8915">The '''star height problem''' in [[formal language theory]] is the question whether all [[regular language]]s can be expressed using [[Regular expression#Formal language theory|regular expression]]s of limited [[star height]], i.e. with a limited nesting depth of [[Kleene star]]s. Specifically, is a nesting depth of one always sufficient? If not, is there an [[algorithm]] to determine how many are required? The problem was raised by {{harvtxt|Eggan|1963}}.

==Families of regular languages with unbounded star height==
The first question was answered in the negative when in 1963, Eggan gave examples of regular languages of [[star height]] ''n'' for every ''n''. Here, the star height ''h''(''L'') of a regular language ''L'' is defined as the minimum star height among all regular expressions representing ''L''. The first few languages found by {{harvtxt|Eggan|1963}} are described in the following, by means of giving a regular expression for each language:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
e_1 &amp;= a_1^* \\
e_2 &amp;= \left(a_1^*a_2^*a_3\right)^*\\
e_3 &amp;= \left(\left(a_1^*a_2^*a_3\right)^*\left(a_4^*a_5^*a_6\right)^*a_7\right)^*\\
e_4 &amp;= \left(
\left(\left(a_1^*a_2^*a_3\right)^*\left(a_4^*a_5^*a_6\right)^*a_7\right)^*
\left(\left(a_8^*a_9^*a_{10}\right)^*\left(a_{11}^*a_{12}^*a_{13}\right)^*a_{14}\right)^*
a_{15}\right)^*
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

The construction principle for these expressions is that expression &lt;math&gt;e_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by concatenating two copies of &lt;math&gt;e_n&lt;/math&gt;, appropriately renaming the letters of the second copy using fresh alphabet symbols, concatenating the result with another fresh alphabet symbol, and then by surrounding the resulting expression with a Kleene star. The remaining, more difficult part, is to prove that for &lt;math&gt;e_n&lt;/math&gt; there is no equivalent regular expression of star height less than ''n''; a proof is given in {{harv|Eggan|1963}}.

However, Eggan's examples use a large [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]], of size 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-1 for the language with star height ''n''. He thus asked whether we can also find examples over binary alphabets. This was proved to be true shortly afterwards by {{harvtxt|Dejean|Schützenberger|1966}}. 
Their examples can be described by an [[inductive definition|inductively defined]] family of regular expressions over the binary alphabet &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; as follows&amp;ndash;cf. {{harvtxt|Salomaa|1981}}:
 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
e_1 &amp; = (ab)^* \\
e_2 &amp; = \left(aa(ab)^*bb(ab)^*\right)^* \\
e_3 &amp; = \left(aaaa \left(aa(ab)^*bb(ab)^*\right)^* bbbb \left(aa(ab)^*bb(ab)^*\right)^*\right)^* \\
\, &amp; \cdots \\
e_{n+1} &amp; = (\,\underbrace{a\cdots a}_{2^n}\, \cdot \, e_n\, \cdot\, \underbrace{b\cdots b}_{2^n}\, \cdot\, e_n \,)^*
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

Again, a rigorous proof is needed for the fact that &lt;math&gt;e_n&lt;/math&gt; does not admit an equivalent regular expression of lower star height. Proofs are given by {{harv|Dejean|Schützenberger|1966}} and by {{harv|Salomaa|1981}}.

==Computing the star height of regular languages==
In contrast, the second question turned out to be much more difficult, and the question became a famous open problem in formal language theory for over two decades {{harv|Brzozowski|1980}}. For years, there was only little progress. The [[pure-group language]]s were the first interesting family of regular languages for which the star height problem was proved to be [[Decidable language|decidable]] {{harv|McNaughton|1967}}. But the general problem remained open for more than 25 years until it was settled by [[Kosaburo Hashiguchi|Hashiguchi]], who in 1988 published an algorithm to determine the [[star height]] of any regular language. The algorithm wasn't at all practical, being of non-[[ELEMENTARY|elementary]] complexity. To illustrate the immense resource consumptions of that algorithm, Lombardy and Sakarovitch (2002) give some actual numbers:

{{Quotation|[The procedure described by Hashiguchi] leads to computations that are by far impossible, even for very small examples. For instance, if ''L'' is accepted by a 4 state automaton of loop complexity 3 (and with a small 10 element transition monoid), then a ''very low minorant'' of the number of languages to be tested with ''L'' for equality is:

&lt;math&gt;\left(10^{10^{10}}\right)^{\left(10^{10^{10}}\right)^{\left(10^{10^{10}}\right)}}.&lt;/math&gt;|S. Lombardy and J. Sakarovitch|Star Height of Reversible Languages and Universal Automata|LATIN 2002}}

Notice that alone the number &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10}}&lt;/math&gt; has 10 billion zeros when written down in [[decimal notation]], and is already ''by far'' larger than the [[Observable universe#Matter content|number of atoms in the observable universe]].

A much more efficient algorithm than Hashiguchi's procedure was devised by Kirsten in 2005. This algorithm runs, for a given [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] as input, within double-[[EXPSPACE|exponential space]]. Yet the resource requirements of this algorithm still greatly exceed the margins of what is considered practically feasible.

This algorithm has been optimized and generalized to trees by Colcombet and Löding in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Colcombet, Christof Löding:

It has been implemented in 2017 in the tool suite Stamina.&lt;ref&gt;Nathanaël Fijalkow, Hugo Gimbert, Edon Kelmendi, Denis Kuperberg: "[http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/denis.kuperberg/papers/CIAA17.pdf Stamina: Stabilisation Monoids in Automata Theory]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1731">In [[number theory]], '''Szpiro's conjecture''' concerns a relationship between the [[conductor of an elliptic curve|conductor]] and the discriminant of an [[elliptic curve]].  In a general form, it is equivalent to the well-known [[abc conjecture]].  It is named for [[Lucien Szpiro]] who formulated it in the 1980s.

The conjecture states that: given &amp;epsilon; &amp;gt; 0, there exists a constant ''C''(&amp;epsilon;) such that for any elliptic curve ''E'' defined over '''Q''' with minimal discriminant &amp;Delta; and conductor ''f'', we have

:&lt;math&gt; \vert\Delta\vert \leq C(\varepsilon ) \cdot f^{6+\varepsilon }. &lt;/math&gt;

The '''modified Szpiro conjecture''' states that: given &amp;epsilon; &amp;gt; 0, there exists a constant ''C''(&amp;epsilon;) such that for any elliptic curve ''E'' defined over '''Q''' with invariants ''c''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and conductor ''f'' (see [[Tate's algorithm#Notation]]), we have

:&lt;math&gt; \max\{\vert c_4\vert^3,\vert c_6\vert^2\} \leq C(\varepsilon )\cdot f^{6+\varepsilon }. &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3146">The '''Turán–Kubilius inequality''' is a [[mathematical theorem]] in [[probabilistic number theory]]. It is useful for proving results about the [[normal order of an arithmetic function]].&lt;ref name="Tenenbaum" /&gt;{{Rp|305–308}} The theorem was proved in a [[special case]] in 1934 by [[Pál Turán]] and generalized in 1956 and 1964 by [[Jonas Kubilius]].&lt;ref name="Tenenbaum"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|316}}

This formulation is from Tenenbaum.&lt;ref name="Tenenbaum" /&gt;{{Rp|302}} Other formulations are in Narkiewicz&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|45–46}}

Suppose ''f'' is an [[Additive map|additive]] complex-valued [[arithmetic function]], and write ''p'' for an arbitrary prime and {{math|''&amp;nu;''}} for an arbitrary positive integer. Write

:&lt;math&gt;A(x)=\sum_{p^\nu \le x} f(p^\nu) p^{-\nu}(1-p^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;B(x)^2 = \sum_{p^\nu \le x} \left| f(p^\nu) \right| ^2 p^{-\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then there is a function ε(''x'') that goes to zero when ''x'' goes to infinity, and such that for ''x'' ≥ 2 we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x} \sum_{n \le x} |f(n) - A(x)|^2 \le (2 + \varepsilon(x)) B(x)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

==Applications of the theorem==
[[Pál Turán|Turán]] developed the inequality to create a simpler proof of the [[Hardy–Ramanujan theorem]] about the [[normal order of an arithmetic function|normal order]] of the number ω(''n'') of distinct prime divisors of an integer ''n''.&lt;ref name="Tenenbaum" /&gt;{{Rp|316}} There is an exposition of Turán's proof in Hardy &amp; Wright, §22.11.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12729">In [[mathematics]], a '''varifold''' is, loosely speaking, a [[measure theory|measure-theoretic]] generalization of the concept of a [[differentiable manifold]], by replacing differentiability requirements with those provided by [[rectifiable set]]s, while maintaining the general algebraic structure usually seen in [[differential geometry]].  Varifolds generalize the idea of a [[Current (mathematics)|rectifiable current]], and are studied in [[geometric measure theory]].

==Historical note==
Varifolds were first introduced by [[Laurence Chisholm Young]] in {{harv|Young|1951}}, under the name "''generalized surfaces''".&lt;ref&gt;In his commemorative papers describing the research of [[Frederick J. Almgren Jr.|Frederick Almgren]], {{harvs|txt|first1=Brian|last1=White|author1-link= Brian White (mathematician)|year=1997|year2=1998|loc1=p.1452, footnote 1|loc2=p.682, footnote 1}} writes that these are "''essentially the same class of surfaces''".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the [http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/documents/Geometic_000.pdf 2015 unpublished essay] of [[Wendell Fleming]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick J. Almgren Jr.]] slightly modified the definition in his mimeographed notes {{harv|Almgren|1965}} and coined the name ''varifold'': he wanted to emphasize that these objects are substitutes for ordinary manifolds in problems of the [[calculus of variations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Almgren|1993|p=46}} exactly writes:-"''I called the objects "varifolds" having in mind that they were a [[Measure theory|measure-theoretic]] substitute for [[manifold]]s created for the [[Calculus of variations|variational calculus]]''". As a matter of fact, the name is a [[portmanteau]] of '''''vari'''ational'' ''man'''ifold'''''.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern approach to the theory was based on Almgren's notes&lt;ref&gt;The first widely circulated exposition of [[Frederick J. Almgren Jr.|Almgren]]'s ideas is the book {{harv|Almgren|1966}}: however, the first systematic exposition of the theory is contained in the mimeographed notes {{harv|Almgren|1965}}, which had a far lower circulation, even if it is cited in [[Herbert Federer]]'s classic text on [[geometric measure theory]]. See also the brief, clear survey by {{harvs|txt|last=De Giorgi|first=Ennio | author-link = Ennio de Giorgi | year=1968|p=400}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and laid down by [[William K. Allard]], in the paper {{harv|Allard|1972}}.

==Definition==
Given an open subset &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, an ''m''-dimensional varifold on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a [[Radon measure]] on the set

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega \times G(n,m)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G(n,m)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Grassmannian]] of all ''m''-dimensional linear subspaces of an ''n''-dimensional vector space. The Grassmannian is used to allow the construction of analogs to [[differential form]]s as duals to vector fields in the [[approximate tangent space]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

The particular case of a rectifiable varifold is the data of a ''m''-rectifiable set ''M'' (which is measurable with respect to the ''m''-dimensional Hausdorff measure), and a density function defined on ''M'', which is a positive function θ measurable and locally integrable with respect to the ''m''-dimensional Hausdorff measure. It defines a Radon measure ''V'' on the Grassmannian bundle of ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''

:&lt;math&gt;V(A) := \int_{\Gamma_{M,A}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\theta(x) \mathrm{d} \mathcal{H}^m(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{M,A}=M \cap \{x : (x, \mathrm{Tan}^m(x,M)) \in A \}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H}^m(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dimension (mathematics)|&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;−dimensional]] [[Hausdorff measure]]
Rectifiable varifolds are weaker objects than locally rectifiable currents: they do not have any [[Orientability|orientation]]. Replacing ''M'' with more regular sets, one easily see that [[Differentiable manifold|differentiable submanifold]]s are particular cases of [[Rectifiable set|rectifiable manifolds]].

Due to the [[Orientability|lack of orientation]], there is no [[boundary operator]] defined on the space of varifolds.

In chapter 4 is a section titled "''A solution to the existence portion of Plateau's problem''" but the stationary varifolds used in this section can only solve a greatly simplified version of the problem. For example, the only stationary varifolds containing the unit circle have support the unit disk. In 1968 Almgren used a combination of varifolds, integral currents, flat chains and Reifenberg's methods in an attempt to extend Reifenberg's celebrated 1960 paper to elliptic integrands. However, there are serious errors in his proof. A different approach to the Reifenberg problem for elliptic integrands has been recently provided by Harrison and Pugh {{harv|HarrisonPugh|2016}} without using varifolds.

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline of [[graph theory]], a '''vertex cover''' (sometimes '''node cover''') of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is a set of vertices such that each edge of the [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is incident to at least one vertex of the set.
The problem of finding a '''minimum vertex cover''' is a classical [[optimization problem]] in [[computer science]] and is a typical example of an [[NP-hard]] optimization problem that has an [[approximation algorithm]]. Its [[decision problem|decision version]], the '''vertex cover problem''', was one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]] and is therefore a classical [[NP-complete]] problem in [[computational complexity theory]]. Furthermore, the vertex cover problem is [[fixed-parameter tractable]] and a central problem in [[parameterized complexity|parameterized complexity theory]].

The minimum vertex cover problem can be formulated as a half-integral [[linear program]] whose [[dual linear program]] is the [[maximum matching problem]].

== Definition ==

Formally, a vertex cover &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; of an undirected graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V, E)&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; uv \in E \Rightarrow  u \in V' \lor v \in V'&lt;/math&gt;, that is to say it is a set of vertices &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; where every edge has at least one endpoint in the vertex cover &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt;. Such a set is said to ''cover'' the edges of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The following figure shows two examples of vertex covers, with some vertex cover &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; marked in red.

:[[File:Vertex-cover.svg]]

A ''minimum vertex cover'' is a vertex cover of smallest possible size.  The vertex cover number &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the size of a minimum vertex cover, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\tau = |V'|&lt;/math&gt;. The following figure shows examples of minimum vertex covers in the previous graphs.

:[[File:Minimum-vertex-cover.svg]]

=== Examples ===

* The set of all vertices is a vertex cover.
* The endpoints of any [[maximal matching]] form a vertex cover.
* The [[complete bipartite graph]] &lt;math&gt;K_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt; has a minimum vertex cover of size &lt;math&gt;\tau(K_{m,n})=\min\{\,m,n\,\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Properties ===

* A set of vertices is a vertex cover if and only if its [[complement (set theory)|complement]] is an [[independent set (graph theory)|independent set]].
* Consequently, the number of vertices of a graph is equal to its minimum vertex cover number plus the size of a maximum independent set ([[Tibor Gallai|Gallai]] 1959).

==Computational problem==

The '''minimum vertex cover problem''' is the [[optimization problem]] of finding a smallest vertex cover in a given graph.
:INSTANCE: Graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;
:OUTPUT: Smallest number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has a vertex cover  of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
If the problem is stated as a [[decision problem]], it is called the '''vertex cover problem''':
:INSTANCE: Graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and positive integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
:QUESTION: Does &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; have a vertex cover of size at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;?

The vertex cover problem is an [[NP-complete]] problem: it was one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]]. It is often used in [[computational complexity theory]] as a starting point for [[NP-hard]]ness proofs.

===ILP formulation===
Assume that every vertex has an associated cost of &lt;math&gt;c(v)\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
The (weighted) minimum vertex cover problem can be formulated as the following [[integer linear program]] (ILP).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vazirani|2003|pp=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{|
| minimize
| colspan="2" | &lt;math&gt;\sum_{v \in V} c(v) x_v&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| (minimize the total cost)
|-
| subject to
| &lt;math&gt;x_u+x_v\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;
| for all &lt;math&gt;\{u,v\} \in E&lt;/math&gt;
|
| (cover every edge of the graph)
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;x_v\in\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;
| for all &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt;.
|
| (every vertex is either in the vertex cover or not)
|}
This ILP belongs to the more general class of ILPs for [[covering problems]].
The [[Linear programming relaxation#Approximation and integrality gap|integrality gap]] of this ILP is &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, so its [[Linear programming relaxation|relaxation]] gives a factor-&lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; [[approximation algorithm]] for the minimum vertex cover problem.
Furthermore, the linear programming relaxation of that ILP is ''half-integral'', that is, there exists an optimal solution for which each entry &lt;math&gt;x_v&lt;/math&gt; is either 0, 1/2, or 1.

=== Exact evaluation ===

The [[decision problem|decision]] variant of the vertex cover problem is [[NP-complete]], which means it is unlikely that there is an efficient algorithm to solve it exactly. NP-completeness can be proven by reduction from [[Boolean satisfiability problem|3-satisfiability]] or, as Karp did, by reduction from the [[clique problem]]. Vertex cover remains NP-complete even in [[cubic graph]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garey|Johnson|Stockmeyer|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even in [[planar graph]]s of degree at most 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garey|Johnson|1977}}; {{harvnb|Garey|Johnson|1979}}, pp. 190 and 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[bipartite graph]]s, the equivalence between vertex cover and maximum matching described by [[Kőnig's theorem (graph theory)|Kőnig's theorem]] allows the bipartite vertex cover problem to be solved in [[polynomial time]].

For [[tree graph]]s, an algorithm finds a minimal vertex cover in polynomial time by finding the first leaf in the tree and adding its parent to the minimal vertex cover, then deleting the leaf and parent and all associated edges and continuing repeatedly until no nodes remain in the tree.

==== Fixed-parameter tractability ====

An [[Brute-force search|exhaustive search]] algorithm can solve the problem in time 2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(1)&lt;/sup&gt;. Vertex cover is therefore [[fixed-parameter tractable]], and if we are only interested in small ''k'', we can solve the problem in [[polynomial time]]. One algorithmic technique that works here is called ''bounded search tree algorithm'', and its idea is to repeatedly choose some vertex and recursively branch, with two cases at each step: place either the current vertex or all its neighbours into the vertex cover.
The algorithm for solving vertex cover that achieves the best asymptotic dependence on the parameter runs in time &lt;math&gt;O(1.2738^k+(k\cdot n))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chen|Kanj|Xia|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[klam value]] of this time bound (an estimate for the largest parameter value that could be solved in a reasonable amount of time) is approximately 190. That is, unless additional algorithmic improvements can be found, this algorithm is suitable only for instances whose vertex cover number is 190 or less. Under reasonable complexity-theoretic assumptions, namely the [[exponential time hypothesis]], the running time cannot be improved to 2&lt;sup&gt;''o''(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;, even when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(k)&lt;/math&gt;.

However, for [[planar graph]]s, and more generally, for graphs excluding some fixed graph as a minor,  a vertex cover of size ''k'' can be found in time ''&lt;math&gt;2^{O(\sqrt{k})} n^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt;'', i.e., the problem is subexponential [[fixed-parameter tractable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Demaine|Fomin|Hajiaghayi|Thilikos|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This algorithm is again optimal, in the sense that, under the [[exponential time hypothesis]], no algorithm can solve vertex cover on planar graphs in time ''&lt;math&gt;2^{o(\sqrt{k})} n^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Flum|Grohe|2006|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approximate evaluation ===

One can find a factor-2 [[approximation algorithm|approximation]] by repeatedly taking ''both'' endpoints of an edge into the vertex cover, then removing them from the graph. Put otherwise, we find a [[maximal matching]] ''M'' with a greedy algorithm and construct a vertex cover ''C'' that consists of all endpoints of the edges in ''M''. In the following figure, a maximal matching ''M'' is marked with red, and the vertex cover ''C'' is marked with blue.

:[[File:Vertex-cover-from-maximal-matching.svg]]

The set ''C'' constructed this way is a vertex cover: suppose that an edge ''e'' is not covered by ''C''; then ''M''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''e''} is a matching and ''e''&amp;nbsp;∉&amp;nbsp;''M'', which is a contradiction with the assumption that ''M'' is maximal. Furthermore, if ''e''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''u'',&amp;nbsp;''v''} ∈ ''M'', then any vertex cover – including an optimal vertex cover – must contain ''u'' or ''v'' (or both); otherwise the edge ''e'' is not covered. That is, an optimal cover contains at least ''one'' endpoint of each edge in ''M''; in total, the set ''C'' is at most 2 times as large as the optimal vertex cover.

This simple algorithm was discovered independently by Fanica Gavril and [[Mihalis Yannakakis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Papadimitriou|Steiglitz|1998}}, p. 432, mentions both Gavril and Yannakakis. {{harvnb|Garey|Johnson|1979}}, p. 134, cites Gavril.&lt;/ref&gt;

More involved techniques show that there are approximation algorithms with a slightly better approximation factor. For example, an approximation algorithm with an approximation factor of &lt;math&gt;2 - \Theta \left( 1 / \sqrt{\log |V|} \right)&lt;/math&gt; is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Karakostas|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem can be approximated with an approximation factor &lt;math&gt;2/(1 + \delta)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; - dense graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Karpinski|Zelikovsky|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inapproximability ====
No better [[constant-factor approximation algorithm]] than the above one is known.
The minimum vertex cover problem is [[APX|APX-complete]], that is, it cannot be approximated arbitrarily well unless  [[P = NP problem|'''P'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''NP''']].
Using techniques from the [[PCP theorem]], [[Irit Dinur|Dinur]] and [[Shmuel Safra|Safra]] proved in 2005 that minimum vertex cover cannot be approximated within a factor of 1.3606 for any sufficiently large vertex degree unless '''P'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''NP'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dinur|Safra|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if the [[unique games conjecture]] is true then minimum vertex cover cannot be approximated within any constant factor better than 2.&lt;ref name="kr08"&gt;{{harvnb|Khot|Regev|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although finding the minimum-size vertex cover is equivalent to finding the maximum-size independent set, as described above, the two problems are not equivalent in an approximation-preserving way: The Independent Set problem has ''no'' constant-factor approximation unless '''P'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''NP'''.

====Pseudo Code====

&lt;source lang="c" line&gt;
APPROXIMATION-VERTEX-COVER(G):
C = ∅
E'= G.E

while E'≠ ∅:
    let (u, v) be an arbitrary edge of E'
    C = C ∪ {u, v}
    remove from E' every edge incident on either u or v

return C
&lt;/source&gt;

==Vertex cover in hypergraphs==

Given a collection of sets, a set which intersects all sets in the collection in at least one element is called a '''hitting set''', and a simple NP-hard problem is to find a hitting set of smallest size or '''minimum hitting set'''. By mapping the sets in the collection onto hyperedges, this can be understood as a natural generalization of the vertex cover problem to [[hypergraph]]s which is often just called '''vertex cover for hypergraphs''' and, in a more combinatorial context, '''[[Hypergraph#Transversals|transversal]]'''.
The notions of hitting set and [[set cover]] are equivalent.

Formally, let ''H''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'') be a hypergraph with vertex set ''V'' and hyperedge set ''E''. Then a set ''S''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''V'' is called ''hitting set'' of ''H'' if, for all edges ''e''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''E'', it holds ''S''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;∅.
The computational problems ''minimum hitting set'' and ''hitting set'' are defined as in the case of graphs. Note that we get back the case of vertex covers for simple graphs if the maximum size of the hyperedges is 2.

If that size is restricted to ''d'', the problem of finding a minimum ''d''-hitting set permits a [[K-approximation of k-hitting set|''d''-approximation]] algorithm. Assuming the [[unique games conjecture]], this is the best constant-factor algorithm that is possible and otherwise there is the possibility of improving the approximation to ''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name="kr08"/&gt;

===Fixed-parameter tractability===

For the hitting set problem, different [[fixed-parameter tractable|parametrizations]] make sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Flum|Grohe|2006|p=10ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The hitting set problem is ''W''[2]-complete for the parameter OPT, that is, it is unlikely that there is an algorithm that runs in time ''f''(OPT)''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(1)&lt;/sup&gt; where OPT is the cardinality of the smallest hitting set.
The hitting set problem is fixed-parameter tractable for the parameter OPT&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''d'', where ''d'' is the size of the largest edge of the hypergraph. More specifically, there is an algorithm for hitting set that runs in time ''d''&lt;sup&gt;OPT&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(1)&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Hitting set and set cover===
The hitting set problem is equivalent to the [[set cover problem]]:
An instance of set cover can be viewed as an arbitrary bipartite graph, with sets represented by vertices on the left, elements of the universe represented by vertices on the right, and edges representing the inclusion of elements in sets. The task is then to find a minimum cardinality subset of left-vertices which covers all of the right-vertices. In the hitting set problem, the objective is to cover the left-vertices using a minimum subset of the right vertices. Converting from one problem to the other is therefore achieved by interchanging the two sets of vertices.

===Applications===
An example of a practical application involving the hitting set problem arises in efficient dynamic detection of [[race condition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Callahan|Choi|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, each time global memory is written, the current thread and set of locks held by that thread are stored. Under lockset-based detection, if later another thread writes to that location and there is ''not'' a race, it must be because it holds at least one lock in common with each of the previous writes. Thus the size of the hitting set represents the minimum lock set size to be race-free. This is useful in eliminating redundant write events, since large lock sets are considered unlikely in practice.

'''Whitehead's lemma''' is a technical result in [[abstract algebra]] used in [[algebraic K-theory]].  It states that a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of the form 

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{bmatrix}
u &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; u^{-1} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; 

is equivalent to the [[identity matrix]] by [[elementary matrices|elementary transformations]] (that is, transvections):

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
u &amp; 0 \\

Here, &lt;math&gt;e_{ij}(s)&lt;/math&gt; indicates a matrix whose diagonal block is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ij^{th}&lt;/math&gt; entry is &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

The name "Whitehead's lemma" also refers to the closely related result that the [[derived group]] of the [[stable general linear group]] is the group generated by [[elementary matrices]].&lt;ref name=Mil31&gt;{{cite book | last1=Milnor | first1=John Willard | author1-link= John Milnor | title=Introduction to algebraic K-theory | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | location=Princeton, NJ | mr=0349811 | year=1971 | zbl=0237.18005 | series=Annals of Mathematics Studies | volume=72 | at=Section 3.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sn164&gt;{{cite book | title=Explicit Brauer Induction: With Applications to Algebra and Number Theory | volume=40 | series=Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics | first=V.

This holds for the stable group (the [[direct limit]] of matrices of finite size) over any ring, but not in general for the unstable groups, even over a field. For instance for

one has:

In [[game theory]], '''Zermelo’s theorem''', named after [[Ernst Zermelo]], says that in any finite two-person game of [[perfect information]] in which the players move alternatingly and in which chance does not affect the decision making process, if the game cannot end in a draw, then one of the two players must have a winning strategy (i.e. force a win). It can alternately be stated as saying that in such a game, either the first-player can force a win, or the second-player can force a win, or both players can force a draw.&lt;ref name=Schwalbe&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwalbe |first1=Ulrich |last2=Walker |first2=Paul |title=Zermelo and the Early History of Game Theory |url=http://www.math.harvard.edu/~elkies/FS23j.03/zermelo.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusions of Zermelo's theorem ==
Zermelo's work shows that in two-person [[Zero-sum game|zero-sum]] games with perfect information, if a player is in a winning position, then he can always force a win no matter what strategy the other player may employ. Furthermore, and as a consequence, if a player is in a winning position, it will never require more moves than there are positions in the game (with a position defined as position of pieces as well as the player next to move).&lt;ref name=Schwalbe/&gt;

== Publication history ==

Zermelo's original paper describing the theorem,
''Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels'', was published in German in 1913. Ulrich Schwalbe and Paul Walker translated Zermelo's paper into English in 1997 and published the translation in the appendix to ''Zermelo and the Early History of Game Theory''.&lt;ref name=Schwalbe/&gt;

== Details ==

Zermelo considers the class of two-person games without chance, where players have strictly opposing interests and where only a finite number of positions are possible. Although in the game only finitely many positions are possible, Zermelo allows infinite sequences of moves since he does not consider stopping rules. Thus, he allows for the possibility of infinite games. Then he addresses two problems:

# What does it mean for a player to be in a 'winning' position and is it possible to define this in an objective mathematical manner?
# If he is in a winning position, can the number of moves needed to force the win be determined?

To answer the first question, Zermelo states that a necessary and sufficient condition is the nonemptyness of a certain set, containing all possible sequences of moves such that a player wins independently of how the other player plays. But should this set be empty, the best a player could achieve would be a draw. So he defines another set containing all possible sequences of moves such that a player can postpone his loss for an infinite number of moves, which implies a draw. This set may also be empty, i. e., the player can avoid his loss for only finitely many moves if his opponent plays correctly. But this is equivalent to the opponent being able to force a win. This is the basis for all modern versions of Zermelo's theorem.

About the second question, Zermelo claimed that it will never take more moves than there are positions in the game. His proof is a [[proof by contradiction]]: Assume that a player can win in a number of moves larger than the number of positions. Of course, at least one winning position must have appeared twice. So the player could have played at the first occurrence in the same way as he does at the second and thus could have won in fewer moves than there are positions.

== Example ==

When applied to [[chess]], Zermelo's Theorem states "either [[White and Black in chess|White]] can force a win, or Black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=MacQuarrie |first=John |title=Mathematics and Chess |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Projects/MacQuarrie/Chapters/Ch4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aumann |first=R.
