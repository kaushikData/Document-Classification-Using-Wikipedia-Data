      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10042">[[File:1percentrule.svg|thumb|Pie chart showing the proportion of lurkers, contributors and creators under the 90–9–1 principle]]

In [[Internet culture]], the '''1% rule''' is a [[rule of thumb]] pertaining to participation in an internet community, stating that only 1% of the users of a website actively create new content, while the other 99% of the participants only [[Lurker|lurk]]. Variants include the ''1–9–90 rule'' (sometimes ''90–9–1 principle'' or the ''89:10:1 ratio''),&lt;ref name="arthur"/&gt; which states that in a collaborative website such as a [[wiki]], 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content.

Similar rules are known in [[information science]], such as the 80/20 rule known as the [[Pareto principle]], that 20 percent of a group will produce 80 percent of the activity, however the activity may be defined.

==Definition==
The 1% rule states that the number of people who create content on the Internet represents approximately 1% of the people who view that content. For example, for every person who posts on a forum, generally about 99 other people view that forum but do not post. The term was coined by authors and bloggers Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba,&lt;ref name="1% rule"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofthecustomer.com/blog/2006/05/charting_wiki_p.html|title=The 1% Rule: Charting citizen participation|last1=McConnell|first1=Ben|first2=Jackie |last2=Huba|date=May 3, 2006|work=Church of the Customer Blog|accessdate=2010-07-10|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511081141/http://www.churchofthecustomer.com/blog/2006/05/charting_wiki_p.html|archivedate= 11 May 2010 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; although earlier references to the same concept&lt;ref name="100-10-1"/&gt; did not use this name.

The terms ''lurk'' and ''lurking'', in reference to online activity, are used to refer to online observation without engaging others in the community, and were first used by veteran print journalist, P. Tomi Austin, circa 1990, when her presence was noticed by other users in chat rooms, who queried her reasons for not engaging in chat.{{cn|date=September 2017}} There were repeated inquiries about her identity and her refusal to engage in chat. The etiquette was, apparently, to greet other users upon entry into the chat rooms/sites. At the time, (then in her 30s, surfing among users averaging in their teens and 20s) she was only identified as "Bilbo", she explained that she was a mature, but computer-literate, user and novice to chat, and preferred to ''lurk'', or was ''lurking'' to familiarize herself with the chat culture, etiquette, and the sites to which she had logged on. In some instances, she needed to explain her coinage of the term "lurking", as the term was new to the online community, but others quickly understood her meaning. To her knowledge, the terms had not been used prior to that period, and there appears to be no earlier dated reference to the coinage.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

A 2005 study of radical Jihadist forums found 87% of users had never posted on the forums, 13% had posted at least once, 5% had posted 50 or more times, and only 1% had posted 500 or more times.&lt;ref name="1% doctrine"&gt;Awan, A. N. (2007b) [http://ecs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/389 'Virtual Jihadist media: Function, legitimacy, and radicalising efficacy'], ''European Journal of Cultural Studies'', vol. 10(3), pp. 389–408.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2014 peer-reviewed paper entitled "The 1% Rule in Four Digital Health Social Networks: An Observational Study" empirically examined the 1% rule in health oriented online forums. The paper concluded that the 1% rule was consistent across the four support groups, with a handful of "Superusers" generating the vast majority of content. &lt;ref&gt;van Mierlo T. [https://www.jmir.org/2014/2/e33/ The 1% Rule in Four Digital Health Social Networks: An Observational Study.] ''J Med Internet Res'' 2014;16(2):e33.&lt;/ref&gt; A study later that year, from a separate group of researchers, replicated the 2014 van Mierlo study in an online forum for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carron-Arthur|first1=B|last2=Cunningham|first2=JA|last3=Griffiths|first3=KM|title=Describing the distribution of engagement in an Internet support group by post frequency: A comparison of the 90-9-1 Principle and Zipf's Law|journal=Internet Interventions|date=2014|volume=1|issue=4|pages=165-168|url=http://www.invent-journal.com/article/S2214-7829(14)00027-X/abstract?cc=y=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results indicated that the distribution frequency of the 1% rule fit followed [[Zipf's Law]], which is a specific type of a [[power law]].  

The "90–9–1" version of this rule states that for websites where users can both create and edit content, 1% of people create content, 9% edit or modify that content, and 90% view the content without contributing.

The actual percentage is likely to vary depending upon the subject matter.  For example, if a forum requires content submissions as a condition of entry, the percentage of people who participate will probably be significantly higher than one percent, but the content producers will still be a minority of users. This is validated in a study conducted by Michael Wu, who uses economics techniques to analyze the participation inequality across hundreds of communities segmented by industry, audience type, and community focus.&lt;ref name="The Economics of 90–9–1"/&gt;

The 1% rule is often misunderstood to apply to the Internet in general, but it applies more specifically to any given Internet community. It is for this reason that one can see evidence for the 1% principle on many websites, but aggregated together one can see a different distribution. This latter distribution is still unknown and likely to shift, but various researchers and pundits have speculated on how to characterize the sum total of participation. Research in late 2012 suggested that only 23% of the population (rather than 90 percent) could properly be classified as lurkers, while 17% of the population could be classified as intense contributors of content.&lt;ref name="Participant choice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/05/bbc_online_briefing_spring_201_1.html|title=BBC Online Briefing Spring 2012: The Participation Choice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several years prior, results were reported on a sample of students from Chicago where 60 percent of the sample created content in some form.&lt;ref name="Participation divide"&gt;Hargittai, E. and Walejko, G. (2008) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691180801946150 'The Participation Divide: Content creation and sharing in the digital age'], ''Information, Communication and Society'', vol. 11(2), pp. 389–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation inequality==
A similar concept was introduced by Will Hill of [[AT&amp;T Laboratories]]&lt;ref name="Edit wear and read wear"/&gt; and later cited by [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]]; this was the earliest known reference to the term "[[participation inequality]]" in an online context.&lt;ref name="participation_inequality"/&gt; The term regained public attention in 2006 when it was used in a strictly quantitative context within a blog entry on the topic of marketing.&lt;ref name="1% rule"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1662">The '''All Species Foundation''' aimed to catalog all [[species]] on [[Earth]] by 2025.  It began in 2001 as a spinoff of the [[Long Now Foundation]].  

The Foundation started with a large grant from the Schlinger Foundation but because of the stock market crash of 2000, at least in part, it was unable to attract appreciable additional funding.   

The All Species Foundation received some criticism over the goal of identifying literally ''all'' species on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bio.cst.temple.edu/~hey/docs/2002/Letter_to_All_Species_Foundation.pdf|title=Letter to the All Species Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism was that in reality species often have indistinct boundaries so that it is often not possible to objectively decide when there is a single species or multiple species.

In [[Hindu philosophy]], the '''antahkarana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: "the inner cause") refers to the totality of two levels of mind, namely the [[buddhi]], the intellect or higher mind, and the [[mana]]s, the middle levels of mind which (according to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]) exist as or include the [[mental body]]. Antahkarana has also been called the link between the middle and higher mind, the reincarnating part of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire''. Lucis Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antahkarana-web.svg|thumb|Antahkarana for computer's radio waves protection]]

In Vedāntic literature, this {{IAST|antahkaraṇa}} (''internal organ'') is organised into four parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mimi.hu/yoga/antahkarana.html |title=Antahkarana - Yoga (definition) |publisher=En.mimi.hu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{IAST|[[Ahamkāra]]}} (''ego'') – identifies the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (''self'') with the body as 'I'
# [[Buddhi]] (''intellect'') – controls decision making
# [[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]] (''mind'') – controls ''sankalpa'' (will or resolution)
# [[Citta|Chitta]] (''memory'') – deals with remembering and forgetting

Another description says that "''antahkarana''" refers to the entire psychological process, including mind and emotions, are composing the mind levels, as described above, which are mentioned as a unit that functions with all parts working together as a whole. Furthermore, when considering that mind levels are bodies, they are: ''manomayakosha'' - related to manas - the part of mind related to five senses, and also craving for new and pleasant sensations and emotions, while buddhi (intellect, intelligence, capacity to reason), is related to vijnanamayakosha - the body of consciousness, knowledge, intuition and experience.

Antahkarana also refers to a symbol used in the [[Reiki]] healing method.

A '''cosmology episode''' is a sudden loss of meaning, followed eventually by a transformative pivot, which creates the conditions for revised meaning.

In the wake of the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the [[Vietnam War]], the 1977 [[Tenerife airport disaster]], the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal chemical disaster]], and the relatively sudden insertion of [[personal computers]] into the workplace, organizational scholar [[Karl E. Weick]] coined the term "cosmology episode," as follows, in 1985:

"Representations of events normally hang together sensibly within the set of assumptions that give them life and constitute a 'cosmos' rather than its opposite, a 'chaos.'  Sudden losses of meaning that can occur when an event is represented electronically in an incomplete, cryptic form are what I call a 'cosmology episode.'  Representations in the electronic world can become chaotic for at least two reasons:  The data in these representations are flawed, and the people who manage those flawed data have limited processing capacity.  These two problems interact in a potentially deadly vicious circle."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1985.  Cosmos vs. Chaos:  Sense and Nonsense in Electronic Contexts.  Organizational Dynamics, 14 (Autumn): 50-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of cosmology episodes evolved significantly between 1985 and 1993, when Weick published his now-classic reanalysis of [[Norman Maclean]]'s study of the [[Mann Gulch fire|Mann Gulch wildland firefighting disaster]] in 1949.  In the 1993 article, Weick positions cosmology episodes within a [[constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] [[ontology]], he links the term to a variety of similar concepts, and he provides a better-developed definition than he was able to provide in 1985.

First, Weick makes it clear that cosmology episodes occur within a constructivist ontology of the world, rather than the more familiar [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivist]] and [[subjectivist]] ontologies:

"The basic idea of [[sensemaking]] is that reality is an ongoing accomplishment that emerges from efforts to create order and make retrospective sense of what occurs....  Sensemaking emphasizes that people try to make things rationally accountable to themselves and others.  Thus, in the words of Morgan, Frost, and Pondy (1983: 24), "individuals are not seen as living in, and acting out their lives in relations ''to'', a wider reality, so much as creating and sustaining images of a wider reality, in part to rationalize what they are doing.  They realize their reality by 'reading into' their situation patterns of significant meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, Weick clarifies the key phrase "sudden loss of meaning" by linking it to related ideas described by other organizational scholars:

"Minimal organizations, such as we find in the crew at Mann Gulch, are susceptible to sudden losses of meaning, which have been variably described as fundamental surprises (Reason, 1990) or as events that are inconceivable (Lanir, 1989), hidden (Westrum, 1982), or incomprehensible (Perrow, 1984).  Each of these labels points to the low probability that the event could occur, which is why it is meaningless.  But these explanations say less about the astonishment of the perceiver, and even less about the perceiver's inability to rebuild some sense of what is happening."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, Weick expands his 1985 definition -- "sudden losses of meaning"—to a more nuanced description:

"Cosmology refers to a branch of philosophy often subsumed under metaphysics that combines rational speculation and scientific evidence to understand the universe as a totality of phenomena.  Cosmology is the ultimate macro perspective, directed at issues of time, space, change, and contingency as they relate to the origin and structure of the universe.  Integrations of these issues, however, are not just the handiwork of philosophers.  Others also must make their peace with these issues, as reflected in what they take for granted.  People, including those who are smokejumpers, act as if events cohere in time and space and that change unfolds in an orderly manner.  These everyday cosmologies are subject to disruption.  And when they are severely disrupted, I call this a cosmology episode (Weick, 1985: 51-52).  A cosmology episode occurs when people suddenly and deeply feel that the universe is no longer a rational, orderly system."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catastrophic Cosmology Episodes ==
Building on Weick's 1993 definition of cosmology episodes, Weick, his colleagues, and other researchers have advanced knowledge of best practices during cosmology episodes at four levels of analysis:  (1) catastrophic cosmology episodes, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001 and the Haitian earthquake of 2010; (2) disastrous cosmology episodes, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 Hurricane Katrina; (3) contextualized cosmology episodes occurring within specific domains, such as the 1976 Three Mile Island nuclear system incident and the 1970 [[Apollo 13]] space system incident; and (4) everyday cosmology episodes, such as transition of leaders at the top of an organization and the introduction of new technologies throughout an organization.

The study of cosmology episodes is distinct from the study of high-reliability organizations because the concept directs explicit attention to the integral role of human spirituality during catastrophic events—as the threatened entity (what now is my role in the universe?), the source of inspiration/improvisation (what now am I able to do to respond to the event?), and the re-established entity (what now is my different role in the universe?).  Consequently, the topic of cosmology episodes lends itself to study by researchers within two small academic organizations—the American Psychological Association's Division 36 (Psychology of Religion and Spirituality) and the Academy of Management's MSR Division (Management, Spirituality, and Religion).

== Disastrous Cosmology Episodes ==
A 2016 article titled "Cosmology Episodes:  A Reconceptualization," Doug Orton and Kari O'Grady identified three taxonomies that they found helpful in studying 164 citations of the term "cosmology episode" on Google Scholar.  One taxonomy was based on level of analysis (nation, community, organization, team, and individual).  One taxonomy was based on five resilience processes (anticipating, sense-losing, improvising, sense-remaking, and renewing).  The third taxonomy -- of interest here -- is level of intensity of the cosmology episode (catastrophe, disaster, crisis, ancillary, and metaphorical).  Communications researchers tend to be more present in the study of community disasters; management researchers tend to be more present in the study of organizational crises.  Importantly, though, it is possible for a community-level cosmology episode to be catastrophic (e.g. Hurrican Katrina), disastrous (e.g the Red River floods of 1997), a crisis (e.g. the 22 July 2005 Stockwell Subway Shooting), ancillary (e.g. an e coli epidemic for a food company), and metaphorical (e.g. the introduction of new technology in an Italian courtroom).

{{otheruses}}

The '''''cotillion''''' (also '''cotillon''' or "'''French country dance'''") is a [[social dance]], popular in 18th-century Europe and America. Originally for four couples in [[square dance|square formation]], it was a courtly version of an ''[[Country dance|English country dance]]'', the forerunner of the ''[[quadrille]]'' and, in the United States, the [[square dance]]. 

It was for some fifty years regarded as an ideal finale to a ball but was eclipsed in the early 19th century by the ''quadrille''. It became so elaborate that it was sometimes presented as a [[concert dance]] performed by trained and rehearsed dancers. The later "German" cotillion included more couples as well as plays and games.

==History==
[[File:Jacob Duck - El cotillón.jpg|left|thumb|A mid-17th century painting by [[Jacob Duck]], called ''The Cotillion'', is the earliest possible reference to a dance with this name.]]
The name ''cotillion'' (French: "[[petticoat]]") appears to have been in use as a dance-name at the beginning of the 18th century but, though it was only ever identified as a sort of country dance, it is impossible to say of what it consisted at that early date.&lt;ref name="Scholes70"&gt;Scholes, P., ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', O.U.P. 1970, article; ''Cotillion''&lt;/ref&gt; 

As we first encounter it, it consists of a main "figure" that varied from dance to dance and was interspersed with "changes" – a number of different figures that broke out of the square formation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standingstones.com/cotill.html "Quadrilles and Cotillions"]: informed musicologists exchange posts.&lt;/ref&gt; often decided spontaneously by the leading couple or by a caller or "conductor".&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (1991), page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these was designed to fit a tune of eight or occasionally sixteen [[Metre (music)|measures]] of 2/4 time. Participants exchanged partners within the formation network of the dance. "Changes" included the "Great Ring", a simple [[circle dance]] with which the dance often began, as well as smaller Ladies' and Gentlemen's rings, top and bottom and sides rings, and chains. Other changes included the ''allemande'', ''promenade'' and ''moulinet''. A complete dance composed of a prescribed order of these was called a "set". 

The ''cotillion'' was introduced into England by 1766&lt;ref&gt;Its first use in English is from 1766, according to ''[[OED]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and to America in about 1772. In England from that time onwards there are a large number of references stressing its universal popularity in the best and highest circles of society, and many teaching manuals were published&lt;ref name="regencydances"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://regencydances.org/paper011.php |title=Cotillion Dancing in England, 1760s to 1810s |work=Regency Dances Org |last=Cooper |first=Paul |publisher=Working Internet Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help recall the vast number of changes that were invented. There is a reference in [[Robert Burns]]'s 1790 poem ''[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]'' to the "cotillion brent-new frae France" (brand new from France). 

Dancing masters differed as to the exact way of doing these dances: some, recognising the affair as an English country dance, taught that the steps and jumps of these were appropriate, while others insisted upon French elegance, recommending the basic step of the [[gavotte]] or the [[minuet]]. In reality many participants simply walked through the figure and changes, seeing these as the dance and the exact steps as dispensable. On the other hand, some figures required high skill at social dancing&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (1991), page 16&lt;/ref&gt; and many performances took place at which the majority preferred to watch rather than dance.&lt;ref name="regencydances"/&gt;

The ''[[quadrille]]'' gained fame a few years later as a variety of cotillion that could be danced by only two couples. In London in 1786 Longman &amp; Broderip's ''6th book of Twenty Four New Cotillions'' brings together for the first time the most characteristic dance-figures of the ''quadrille;  Les Pantalons, L'Eté, La Belle Poule'' and ''La Pastorale''. However, while the ''cotillion'' kept all the dancers in almost perpetual motion, the quadrille often allowed rest to half of the participants while the other half danced.

In the 1790s the ''cotillion'' was falling from favour, but it re-emerged in a new style in the early years of the next century, with fewer and fewer changes, making it barely distinguishable from the newly-emerging ''quadrille'', which was introduced into English high society by Lady Jersey in 1816&lt;ref name="Scholes70" /&gt; and by 1820 had eclipsed the ''cotillion'', though it was recognisably a very similar dance, particularly as it also began to be danced by four couples. References to the English Cotillion dances persist here and there until the 1840s, but these were more games than fashionable dances, and were often danced to the [[waltz]] or the [[mazurka]].&lt;ref name="Scholes70" /&gt;

In the [[United States]], however, the opposite was true: quadrilles were termed cotillions until the 1840s, when it was realised that all the distinctive figures of the earlier dance had been taken up into the newer. The German cotillion was introduced to [[New York City|New York]] society at a [[costume ball]] with a Louis XV theme given by Mr. William Colford Schermerhorn in the early winter of 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd R. Morris, ''Incredible New York: Life and Low Life of Last Hundred Years'' 1979:17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, too, waltzes, mazurkas, fun, games and boisterous behaviour at private parties took on a more important role,&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (1991), page 17&lt;/ref&gt; and only some figures of the earlier dances survived. Finally the term cotillion was used to refer to the [[Cotillion ball|ball itself]] and the cotillion and quadrille became the [[Traditional square dance|square dance]].

[[File:Wikipedia article-creation-2.svg|thumb|Sample [[flowchart]] representing a decision process to add a new article to Wikipedia.]]

In [[psychology]], '''decision-making''' (also spelled '''decision making''' and '''decisionmaking''') is regarded as the [[Cognition|cognitive process]] resulting in the selection of a belief or a course of action among several alternative possibilities. Every decision-making process produces a final [[choice]], which may or may not prompt action.

Decision-making is the process of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the [[value (ethics)|value]]s, [[preference]]s and beliefs of the decision-maker.

==Overview==
Decision-making can be regarded as a problem-solving activity terminated by a solution deemed to be optimal, or at least satisfactory. It is therefore a process which can be more or less [[Rationality|rational]] or [[Irrationality|irrational]] and can be based on [[explicit knowledge|explicit]] or [[tacit knowledge]] and beliefs. Tacit knowledge can be obtained by experience or reflection, for instance. It might be something, that you are not able to put in words, as opposed to explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is often used to fill the gaps in complex decision making processes. &lt;ref&gt;.https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1059601102238356 Brockmann, E., Anthony, W., 2002. Tacit knowledge and strategic decision making. Group &amp; Organization Management.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually both of these types of knowledge, tacit and explicit, are used in decision-making process together. Explicit knowledge is less likely to result in major decisions than tacit knowledge, which means that the decision-making process usually relies on knowledge acquired through experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~negre/fichiers_joints/kmiks13.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Human performance has been the subject of active research from several perspectives:
* [[Psychology|Psychological]]: examining individual decisions in the context of a set of needs, preferences and values the individual has or seeks.
* [[Cognition|Cognitive]]: the decision-making process regarded as a continuous process integrated in the interaction with the environment.
* [[Normative]]: the analysis of individual decisions concerned with the logic of decision-making, or [[communicative rationality]], and the invariant choice it leads to.&lt;ref name="Kahneman"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kahneman |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-link=Daniel Kahneman |editor2-last=Tversky |editor2-first=Amos |editor2-link=Amos Tversky |date=2000 |title=Choices, values, and frames |location=New York; Cambridge, UK |publisher=[[Russell Sage Foundation]]; [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521621724 |oclc=42934579 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=P5GsREMbUmAC&amp;pg=PA211 211]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major part of decision-making involves the analysis of a finite set of alternatives described in terms of evaluative criteria. Then the task might be to rank these alternatives in terms of how attractive they are to the decision-maker(s) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Another task might be to find the best alternative or to determine the relative total priority of each alternative (for instance, if alternatives represent projects competing for funds) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Solving such problems is the focus of [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA). This area of decision-making, although very old, has attracted the interest of many researchers and practitioners and is still highly debated as there are many MCDA methods which may yield very different results when they are applied on exactly the same data.&lt;ref name=MCDM&gt;{{cite book |last=Triantaphyllou |first=Evangelos |title=Multi-criteria decision making methods: a comparative study |volume=44 |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |series=Applied optimization |year=2000 |location=Dordrecht, Netherlands |page=320 |url=http://www.csc.lsu.edu/trianta/Books/DecisionMaking1/Book1.htm |isbn=978-0792366072 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-3157-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the formulation of a [[decision-making paradox]].

[[Logic]]al decision-making is an important part of all science-based professions, where specialists apply their [[knowledge]] in a given area to make informed decisions. For example, medical decision-making often involves a [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and the selection of appropriate treatment. But [[naturalistic decision-making]] research shows that in situations with higher time pressure, higher stakes, or increased ambiguities, experts may use [[Intuition (psychology)|intuitive]] decision-making rather than structured approaches. They may follow a [[recognition primed decision]] that fits their experience and arrive at a course of action without weighing alternatives.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The decision-maker's environment can play a part in the decision-making process. For example, environmental complexity is a factor that influences cognitive function.&lt;ref name="necsi.edu"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Alice Ware |last2=Bar-Yam |first2=Yaneer |date=2006 |origyear=2000 |chapter=Environmental complexity: information for human–environment well-being |editor1-last=Bar-Yam |editor1-first=Yaneer |editor2-last=Minai |editor2-first=Ali |title=Unifying themes in complex systems |location=Berlin; New York |publisher=Springer |pages=157–168 |isbn=9783540358640 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-35866-4_16 |chapterurl=http://necsi.edu/projects/yaneer/envcomplexity00.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.33.7118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex environment is an environment with a large number of different possible states which come and go over time.&lt;ref name="its.caltech.edu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Godfrey-Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Godfrey-Smith |date=2001 |chapter=Environmental complexity and the evolution of cognition |editor1-last=Sternberg |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor1-link=Robert Sternberg |editor2-last=Kaufman |editor2-first=James C. |editor2-link=James C.

One experiment measured complexity in a room by the number of small objects and appliances present; a simple room had less of those things. Cognitive function was greatly affected by the higher measure of environmental complexity making it easier to think about the situation and make a better decision.&lt;ref name="necsi.edu"/&gt;

Research about decision-making is also published under the label [[problem solving]], in particular in European [[psychological research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Frensch |editor1-first=Peter A. |editor2-last=Funke |editor2-first=Joachim |date=1995 |title=Complex problem solving: the European perspective |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |isbn=978-0805813364 |oclc=32131412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problem analysis ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

It is important to differentiate between [[problem analysis]] and decision-making. Traditionally, it is argued that problem analysis must be done first, so that the information gathered in that process may be used towards decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kepner |first1=Charles Higgins |last2=Tregoe |first2=Benjamin B. |authorlink2=Benjamin Tregoe |date=1997 |origyear=1965 |title=The new rational manager: an updated edition for a new world |edition=Updated |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton Research Press |oclc=37666447 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}

; Characteristics of problem analysis:
* Problems are merely deviations from performance standards
* Problems must be precisely identified and described
* Problems are caused by a change from a distinctive feature
* Something can always be used to distinguish between what has and hasn't been affected by a cause
* Causes of problems can be deduced from relevant changes found in analyzing the problem
* Most likely cause of a problem is the one that exactly explains all the facts, while having the fewest (or weakest) assumptions ([[Occam's razor]]).

; Characteristics of decision-making:
* Objectives must first be established
* Objectives must be classified and placed in order of importance
* Alternative actions must be developed
* The alternatives must be evaluated against all the objectives
* The alternative that is able to achieve all the objectives is the tentative decision
* The tentative decision is evaluated for more possible consequences
* The decisive actions are taken, and additional actions are taken to prevent any adverse consequences from becoming problems and starting both systems (problem analysis and decision-making) all over again
* There are steps that are generally followed that result in a decision model that can be used to determine an optimal production plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monahan |first=George E. |date=2000 |title=Management decision making: spreadsheet modeling, analysis, and application |location=Cambridge, UK; New York |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521781183 |oclc=42921287 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kOAKlA-PJTkC&amp;pg=PA33 33–40]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis paralysis===
{{Main|Analysis paralysis}}

[[Analysis paralysis]] is the state of over-analyzing (or over-thinking) a situation so that a decision or action is never taken, in effect paralyzing the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/analysis_paralysis|title=analysis paralysis {{!}} Definition of analysis paralysis in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information overload===
{{Main|Information overload}}

Information overload is "a gap between the volume of information and the tools we have to assimilate" it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Saffo]] quoted in: {{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/551/51mtinf.htm |date=30 October 1995 |title=Managing information: infoglut |last=Foley |first=John |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010222082946/http://www.informationweek.com/551/51mtinf.htm |archivedate=2001-02-22 |accessdate=2015-07-26 |publisher=[[InformationWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information used in decision making is to reduce or eliminate uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|date=1972|title=Characteristics of organizational environments and perceived environment uncertainty|url=|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=17|issue=3|pages=313–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive information affects problem processing and tasking, which affects decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kutty |first1=Ambalika D. |last2=Kumar Shee |first2=Himanshu |last3=Pathak |first3=R.

Hall and colleagues described an "illusion of knowledge", which means that as individuals encounter too much knowledge it can interfere with their ability to make rational decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Crystal C. |last2=Ariss |first2=Lynn |last3=Todorov |first3=Alexander |date=July 2007 |title=The illusion of knowledge: when more information reduces accuracy and increases confidence |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=277–290 |doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2007.01.003 |url=http://courses.washington.edu/pbafhall/514/514%20Readings/Hall-OBHDP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-decision analysis===

Evaluation and analysis of past decisions is complementary to decision-making. See also [[Mental accounting]] and [[Postmortem documentation]].

== Decision-making techniques ==

Decision-making techniques can be separated into two broad categories: [[group decision-making]] techniques and individual decision-making techniques. Individual decision-making techniques can also often be applied by a group.

===Group===
* [[Consensus decision-making]] tries to avoid "winners" and "losers". Consensus requires that a majority approve a given course of action, but that the minority agree to go along with the course of action. In other words, if the minority opposes the course of action, consensus requires that the course of action be modified to remove objectionable features.
* [[Voting|Voting-based methods]]:
** [[Majority]] requires support from more than 50% of the members of the group. Thus, the bar for action is lower than with consensus.
** [[Plurality voting system|Plurality]], where the largest block in a group decides, even if it falls short of a majority.
** [[Range voting]] lets each member score one or more of the available options. The option with the highest average is chosen.

== Steps ==
A variety of researchers have formulated similar prescriptive steps aimed at improving decision-making.

===GOFER&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Gofer (disambiguation)]] and [[GROW model]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;===
In the 1980s, psychologist Leon Mann and colleagues developed a decision-making process called GOFER, which they taught to adolescents, as summarized in the book ''Teaching Decision Making To Adolescents''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mann |first1=Leon |last2=Harmoni |first2=Ros |last3=Power |first3=Colin |date=1991 |chapter=The GOFER course in decision making |editor1-last=Baron |editor1-first=Jonathan |editor2-last=Brown |editor2-first=Rex V. |title=Teaching decision making to adolescents |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |pages=61–78 |isbn=978-0805804973 |oclc=22507012 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=voRVQEAZJYYC&amp;pg=PA61}} See also: {{cite journal |last=Mann |first=Leon |date=July 1989 |title=Becoming a better decision maker |journal=Australian Psychologist |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=141–155 |doi=10.1080/00050068908259558}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was based on extensive earlier research conducted with psychologist [[Irving Janis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Janis |first1=Irving L. |authorlink1=Irving Janis |last2=Mann |first2=Leon |date=1977 |title=Decision making: a psychological analysis of conflict, choice, and commitment |location=New York |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=978-0029161609 |oclc=2542340}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOFER is an [[acronym]] for five decision-making steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=Leon |last2=Harmoni |first2=Ros |last3=Power |first3=Colin |last4=Beswick |first4=Gery |last5=Ormond |first5=Cheryl |date=July 1988 |title=Effectiveness of the GOFER course in decision making for high school students |journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=159–168 |doi=10.1002/bdm.3960010304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
In 2007, Pam Brown of [[Singleton Hospital]] in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]], divided the decision-making process into seven steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/career-coach-decision-making/10967084.article |last=Brown |first=Pam |title=Career coach: decision-making |publisher=Pulse |date=November 29, 2007 |accessdate=July 12, 2012}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, professor John Pijanowski described how the Arkansas Program, an ethics curriculum at the [[University of Arkansas]], used eight stages of [[Morality|moral]] decision-making based on the work of [[James Rest]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pijanowski |first=John |date=February 2009 |title=The role of learning theory in building effective college ethics curricula |journal=Journal of College and Character |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=1–13 |doi=10.2202/1940-1639.1088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}
# Establishing community: Create and nurture the relationships, norms, and procedures that will influence how problems are understood and communicated. This stage takes place prior to and during a moral dilemma.
# Perception: Recognize that a problem exists.
# Interpretation: Identify competing explanations for the problem, and evaluate the drivers behind those interpretations.
# Judgment: Sift through various possible actions or responses and determine which is more justifiable.
# Motivation: Examine the competing commitments which may distract from a more moral course of action and then prioritize and commit to moral values over other personal, institutional or social values.
# Action: Follow through with action that supports the more justified decision.
# Reflection in action.
# Reflection on action.

===Group stages===

According to B. Aubrey Fisher, there are four stages or phases that should be involved in all group decision-making:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffin |first=Emory A. |date=1991 |chapter=Interact system model of decision emergence of B. Aubrey Fisher |title=A first look at communication theory |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |edition=1st |pages=253–262 |isbn=978-0070227781 |oclc=21973427 |chapterurl=http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/intersys.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Orientation. Members meet for the first time and start to get to know each other.
* Conflict. Once group members become familiar with each other, disputes, little fights and arguments occur. Group members eventually work it out.
* Emergence. The group begins to clear up vague opinions by talking about them.
* [[Reinforcement]]. Members finally make a decision and provide justification for it.

It is said that establishing critical norms in a group improves the quality of decisions, while the majority of opinions (called consensus norms) do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Postmes |first=T |title=Quality of decision making and group norms |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |year=2001 |volume=80 |issue=6 |pages=918–930 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.918 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/80/6/918/ |last2=Spears |first2=Russell |last3=Cihangir |first3=Sezgin |pmid=11414374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflicts in socialization are divided in to functional and dysfunctional types. Functional conflicts are mostly the questioning the managers assumptions in their decision making and dysfunctional conflicts are like personal attacks and every action which decrease team effectiveness. Functional conflicts are the better ones to gain higher quality decision making caused by the increased team knowledge and shared understanding.&lt;ref&gt; Brockmann, E., Anthony, W., 2002. Tacit knowledge and strategic decision making. Group &amp; Organization Management. Vol. 27 (4), 436–455. {{doi|10.1177/1059601102238356}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Rational and irrational ==

In [[economics]], it is thought that if humans are rational and free to make their own decisions, then they would behave according to [[rational choice theory]].&lt;ref name="Schacter2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schacter |first1=Daniel L. |authorlink1=Daniel Schacter |last2=Gilbert |first2=Daniel Todd |authorlink2=Daniel Gilbert (psychologist) |last3=Wegner |first3=Daniel M. |authorlink3=Daniel Wegner |date=2011 |origyear=2009 |title=Psychology |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=9781429237192 |oclc=755079969}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|368–370}} Rational choice theory says that a person consistently makes choices that lead to the best situation for himself or herself, taking into account all available considerations including costs and benefits; the rationality of these considerations is from the point of view of the person himself, so a decision is not irrational just because someone else finds it questionable.

In reality, however, there are some factors that affect decision-making abilities and cause people to make irrational decisions{{spaced ndash}}for example, to make contradictory choices when faced with the same problem [[framing (social sciences)|framed]] in two different ways (see also [[Allais paradox]]).

One of the most prominent theories of decision making is [[subjective expected utility]] (SEU) theory, which describes the rational behavior of the decision maker.&lt;ref name="Crozier"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crozier |first1=W. Ray |last2=Ranyard |first2=Rob |date=1997 |chapter=Cognitive process models and explanations of decision making |editor1-last=Ranyard |editor1-first=Rob |editor2-last=Crozier |editor2-first=W. Ray |editor3-last=Svenson |editor3-first=Ola |title=Decision making: cognitive models and explanations |series=Frontiers of cognitive science |location=London; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |pages=5–20 |isbn=978-0415158183 |oclc=37043834}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision maker assesses different alternatives by their utilities and the subjective probability of occurrence.&lt;ref name="Crozier"/&gt;

Rational decision-making is often grounded on experience and theories exist that are able to put this approach on solid mathematical grounds so that subjectivity is reduced to a minimum, see e.g. [[scenario optimization]].

== Cognitive and personal biases ==

[[Bias]]es usually affect decision-making processes. They appear more when decision task has time pressure, is done under high stress and/or task is highly complex. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=T|first=Maqsood|last2=A|first2=Finegan|last3=D|first3=Walker|date=2004|title=Biases and heuristics in judgment and decision making: The dark side of tacit knowledge|url=http://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/view/rmit:2008|journal=Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology|language=en|volume=1|issn=1547-5840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a list of commonly debated [[List of biases in judgment and decision-making|biases in judgment and decision-making]]:

* Selective search for [[evidence]] (also known as [[confirmation bias]]): People tend to be willing to gather facts that support certain conclusions but disregard other facts that support different conclusions. Individuals who are highly defensive in this manner show significantly greater left prefrontal cortex activity as measured by [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] than do less defensive individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blackhart |first=G. C. |last2=Kline |first2=J. P. |year=2005 |title=Individual differences in anterior EEG asymmetry between high and low defensive individuals during a rumination/distraction task |journal=[[Personality and Individual Differences]] |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=427–437 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.01.027 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228480310}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Premature termination of search for evidence: People tend to accept the first alternative that looks like it might work.
* [[Cognitive inertia]] is the unwillingness to change existing thought patterns in the face of new circumstances.
* Selective perception: People actively screen out information that they do not think is important (see also [[Prejudice]]). In one demonstration of this effect, discounting of arguments with which one disagrees (by judging them as untrue or irrelevant) was decreased by selective activation of right prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drake |first=R. A. |year=1993 |title=Processing persuasive arguments: 2. Discounting of truth and relevance as a function of agreement and manipulated activation asymmetry |journal=[[Journal of Research in Personality]] |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=184–196 |doi=10.1006/jrpe.1993.1013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wishful thinking]] is a tendency to want to see things in a certain{{spaced ndash}}usually positive{{spaced ndash}}light, which can distort perception and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chua |first=E. F. |last2=Rand-Giovannetti |first2=E. |last3=Schacter |first3=D. L. |last4=Albert |first4=M. |last5=Sperling |first5=R. A. |year=2004 |title=Dissociating confidence and accuracy: Functional magnetic resonance imaging shows origins of the subjective memory experience |journal=[[Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience]] |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=1131–1142 |doi=10.1162/0898929041920568 |pmid=15453969 |url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3627270/Schacter_DissociatingConfidence.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Choice-supportive bias]] occurs when people distort their memories of chosen and rejected options to make the chosen options seem more attractive.
* Recency: People tend to place more attention on more recent information and either ignore or forget more distant information (see [[Semantic priming]]). The opposite effect in the first set of data or other information is termed ''[[primacy effect]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plous |first=Scott |date=1993 |title=The psychology of judgment and decision making |location=Philadelphia |publisher=[[Temple University Press]] |isbn=978-0877229131 |oclc=26548229 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}
* Repetition bias is a willingness to believe what one has been told most often and by the greatest number of different sources.
* [[Anchoring and adjustment]]: Decisions are unduly influenced by initial information that shapes our view of subsequent information.
* [[Groupthink]] is [[peer pressure]] to conform to the opinions held by the group.
* Source credibility bias is a tendency to reject a person's statement on the basis of a bias against the person, organization, or group to which the person belongs. People preferentially accept statement by others that they like (see also [[Prejudice]]).
* Incremental decision-making and escalating commitment: People look at a decision as a small step in a process, and this tends to perpetuate a series of similar decisions. This can be contrasted with ''zero-based decision-making'' (see [[Slippery slope]]).
* [[Attribution theory|Attribution asymmetry]]: People tend to attribute their own success to internal factors, including abilities and talents, but explain their failures in terms of external factors such as bad luck. The reverse bias is shown when people explain others' success or failure.
* Role fulfillment is a tendency to conform to others' decision-making expectations.
* Underestimating [[uncertainty]] and the [[illusion of control]]: People tend to underestimate future uncertainty because of a tendency to believe they have more control over events than they really do.
* [[Framing (social sciences)#Absolute and relative influences|Framing bias]]: This is best avoided by increasing [[numeracy]] and presenting data in several formats (for example, using both absolute and relative scales).&lt;ref name="pmid21792695"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perneger |first1=Thomas V. |last2=Agoritsas |first2=Thomas |date=December 2011 |title=Doctors and patients' susceptibility to framing bias: a randomized trial |journal=[[Journal of General Internal Medicine]] |volume=26 |issue=12 |pages=1411–1417 |doi=10.1007/s11606-011-1810-x |pmid=21792695 |ref=harv |pmc=3235613}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Sunk-cost fallacy]] is a specific type of framing effect that affects decision-making. It involves an individual making a decision about a current situation based on what they have previously invested in the situation.&lt;ref name="Schacter2011"/&gt;{{rp|372}} An example of this would be an individual that is refraining from dropping a class that they are most likely to fail, due to the fact that they feel as though they have done so much work in the course thus far.
* [[Prospect theory]] involves the idea that when faced with a decision-making event, an individual is more likely to take on a risk when evaluating potential losses, and are more likely to avoid risks when evaluating potential gains. This can influence one's decision-making depending if the situation entails a threat, or opportunity.&lt;ref name="Schacter2011"/&gt;{{rp|373}}
* [[Optimism bias]] is a tendency to overestimate the likelihood of positive events occurring in the future and underestimate the likelihood of negative life events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharot |first=Tali |date=2011 |title=The optimism bias: a tour of the irrationally positive brain |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |isbn=9780307378484 |oclc=667609433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such biased expectations are generated and maintained in the face of counter-evidence through a tendency to discount undesirable information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sharot |first1=Tali |last2=Korn |first2=Christoph W. |last3=Dolan |first3=Raymond J. |date=October 2011 |title=How unrealistic optimism is maintained in the face of reality |journal=[[Nature Neuroscience]] |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=1475–1479 |doi=10.1038/nn.2949 |pmid=21983684 |pmc=3204264}}&lt;/ref&gt; An optimism bias can alter risk perception and decision-making in many domains, ranging from finance to health.
* [[Reference class forecasting]] was developed to eliminate or reduce cognitive biases in decision-making.

== Cognitive limitations in groups ==
{{Main|Group decision-making#Group discussion pitfalls}}
In groups, people generate decisions through active and complex processes. One method consists of three steps: initial preferences are expressed by members; the members of the group then gather and share information concerning those preferences; finally, the members combine their views and make a single choice about how to face the problem. Although these steps are relatively ordinary, judgements are often distorted by cognitive and motivational biases, include "sins of commission", "sins of omission", and "sins of imprecision".&lt;ref name="Group Dynamics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=Donelson R. |date=2014 |origyear=1983 |title=Group dynamics |edition=6th |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=[[Wadsworth Cengage Learning]] |isbn=9781133956532 |oclc=826872491}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2017}}

== Cognitive styles ==

===Optimizing vs. satisficing===
{{main|Maximization (psychology)}}

[[Herbert A. Simon]] coined the phrase "[[bounded rationality]]" to express the idea that human decision-making is limited by available information, available time and the mind's information-processing ability. Further psychological research has identified individual differences between two cognitive styles: ''[[Maximization (psychology)|maximizers]]'' try to make an [[optimal decision]], whereas ''[[satisficer]]s'' simply try to find a solution that is "good enough". Maximizers tend to take longer making decisions due to the need to maximize performance across all variables and make tradeoffs carefully; they also tend to more often regret their decisions (perhaps because they are more able than satisficers to recognise that a decision turned out to be sub-optimal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sparks |first=Erin |date=2007 |chapter=Satisficing |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F. |editor1-link=Roy Baumeister |editor2-last=Vohs |editor2-first=Kathleen D. |title=Encyclopedia of social psychology |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |pages=776–778 |isbn=9781412916707 |oclc=123119782 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQBzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intuitive vs. rational===
{{Main|Dual process theory}}

The psychologist [[Daniel Kahneman]], adopting terms originally proposed by the psychologists [[Keith Stanovich]] and Richard West, has theorized that a person's decision-making is the result of an interplay between two kinds of [[cognitive process]]es: an automatic intuitive system (called "System 1") and an effortful rational system (called "System 2"). System 1 is a bottom-up, fast, and implicit system of decision-making, while system 2 is a top-down, slow, and explicit system of decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Kahneman |date=2011 |title=Thinking, fast and slow |location=New York |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus, and Giroux]] |isbn=9780374275631 |oclc=706020998}}&lt;/ref&gt; System 1 includes simple [[heuristics in judgment and decision-making]] such as the [[affect heuristic]], the [[availability heuristic]], the [[familiarity heuristic]], and the [[representativeness heuristic]].

===Combinatorial vs. positional===

Styles and methods of decision-making were elaborated by [[Aron Katsenelinboigen]], the founder of [[predispositioning theory]]. In his analysis on styles and methods, Katsenelinboigen referred to the game of chess, saying that "chess does disclose various methods of operation, notably the creation of predisposition-methods which may be applicable to other, more complex systems."&lt;ref name="Concept of Indeterminism"&gt;{{cite book |last=Katsenelinboigen |first=Aron |authorlink=Aron Katsenelinboigen |date=1997 |title=The concept of indeterminism and its applications: economics, social systems, ethics, artificial intelligence, and aesthetics |location=Westport, CT |publisher=Praeger |isbn=978-0275957889 |oclc=36438766 |url=http://aronkatsenelinboigen.net/CONCEPT_OF_INDETERMINISM.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Katsenelinboigen states that apart from the methods (reactive and selective) and sub-methods (randomization, predispositioning, programming), there are two major styles: positional and combinational. Both styles are utilized in the game of chess. According to Katsenelinboigen, the two styles reflect two basic approaches to [[uncertainty]]: deterministic (combinational style) and indeterministic (positional style). Katsenelinboigen's definition of the two styles are the following.

The combinational style is characterized by:
* a very narrow, clearly defined, primarily material goal; and
* a program that links the initial position with the final outcome.

In defining the combinational style in chess, Katsenelinboigen wrote: "The combinational style features a clearly formulated limited objective, namely the capture of material (the main constituent element of a chess position). The objective is implemented via a well-defined, and in some cases, unique sequence of moves aimed at reaching the set goal. As a rule, this sequence leaves no options for the opponent. Finding a combinational objective allows the player to focus all his energies on efficient execution, that is, the player's analysis may be limited to the pieces directly partaking in the combination. This approach is the crux of the combination and the combinational style of play.&lt;ref name="Concept of Indeterminism"/&gt;{{rp|57}}

The positional style is distinguished by:
* a positional goal; and
* a formation of semi-complete linkages between the initial step and final outcome.

"Unlike the combinational player, the positional player is occupied, first and foremost, with the elaboration of the position that will allow him to develop in the unknown future. In playing the positional style, the player must evaluate relational and material parameters as independent variables. ... The positional style gives the player the opportunity to develop a position until it becomes pregnant with a combination. However, the combination is not the final goal of the positional player{{spaced ndash}}it helps him to achieve the desirable, keeping in mind a predisposition for the future development. The [[pyrrhic victory]] is the best example of one's inability to think positionally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ulea |first=Vera |date=2002 |title=A concept of dramatic genre and the comedy of a new type: chess, literature, and film |location=Carbondale |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]] |isbn=978-0809324521 |oclc=51301095 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QPWAkw_k5PkC&amp;pg=PA17 17–18]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The positional style serves to:
* create a predisposition to the future development of the position;
* induce the environment in a certain way;
* absorb an unexpected outcome in one's favor; and
* avoid the negative aspects of unexpected outcomes.

===Influence of Myers-Briggs type===

According to [[Isabel Briggs Myers]], a person's decision-making process depends to a significant degree on their cognitive style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Myers |first1=Isabel Briggs |authorlink1=Isabel Briggs Myers  |last2=Kirby |first2=Linda K. |last3=Myers |first3=Katharine D. |date=1998 |origyear=1976 |title=Introduction to type: a guide to understanding your results on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator |edition=6th |series=Introduction to type series |location=Palo Alto, CA |publisher=Consulting Psychologists Press |oclc=40336039}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2015}} Myers developed a set of four bi-polar dimensions, called the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] (MBTI). The terminal points on these dimensions are: ''thinking'' and ''feeling''; ''extroversion'' and ''introversion''; ''judgment'' and ''perception''; and ''sensing'' and ''intuition''. She claimed that a person's decision-making style correlates well with how they score on these four dimensions. For example, someone who scored near the thinking, extroversion, sensing, and judgment ends of the dimensions would tend to have a logical, analytical, objective, critical, and empirical decision-making style.

Other studies suggest that these national or [[cross-cultural differences in decision-making]] exist across entire societies. For example, [[Maris Martinsons]] has found that American, Japanese and Chinese business leaders each exhibit a distinctive national style of decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Martinsons |first=Maris G. |date=December 2006 |title=Comparing the decision styles of American, Chinese and Japanese business leaders |publisher=Best Paper Proceedings of [[Academy of Management]] Meetings, Washington, DC, August 2001 |ssrn=952292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neuroscience ==

Decision-making is a region of intense study in the fields of [[systems neuroscience]], and [[cognitive neuroscience]]. Several brain structures, including the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC), [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and the overlapping [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] are believed to be involved in decision-making processes. A [[neuroimaging]] study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walton |first1=Mark E. |last2=Devlin |first2=Joseph T. |last3=Rushworth |first3=Matthew F. S. |date=November 2004 |title=Interactions between decision making and performance monitoring within prefrontal cortex |journal=[[Nature Neuroscience]] |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=1259–1265 |doi=10.1038/nn1339 |pmid=15494729}}&lt;/ref&gt; found distinctive patterns of neural activation in these regions depending on whether decisions were made on the basis of perceived personal [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] or following directions from someone else. Patients with damage to the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] have difficulty making advantageous decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Damasio |first=Antonio R. |authorlink=Antonio Damasio |date=1994 |title=Descartes' error: emotion, reason, and the human brain |location=New York |publisher=Putnam |isbn=978-0399138942 |oclc=30780083}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}

A common laboratory paradigm for studying neural decision-making is the [[two-alternative forced choice]] task (2AFC), in which a subject has to choose between two alternatives within a certain time. A study of a [[two-alternative forced choice]] task involving [[rhesus monkey]]s found that neurons in the [[parietal cortex]] not only represent the formation of a decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gold |first1=Joshua I. |last2=Shadlen |first2=Michael N. |date=2007 |title=The neural basis of decision making |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |volume=30 |pages=535–574 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.29.051605.113038 |pmid=17600525}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also signal the degree of certainty (or "confidence") associated with the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kiani |first1=Roozbeh |last2=Shadlen |first2=Michael N. |date=May 2009 |title=Representation of confidence associated with a decision by neurons in the parietal cortex |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5928 |pages=759–764 |doi=10.1126/science.1169405 |pmid=19423820 |pmc=2738936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent study found that lesions to the ACC in the [[macaque]] resulted in impaired decision-making in the long run of reinforcement guided tasks suggesting that the ACC may be involved in evaluating past reinforcement information and guiding future action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kennerley |first1=Steven W. |last2=Walton |first2=Mark E. |last3=Behrens |first3=Timothy E.

=== Emotions ===
{{Main|Emotions in decision-making}}
[[Emotion]] appears able to aid the decision-making process. Decision-making often occurs in the face of [[uncertainty]] about whether one's choices will lead to benefit or harm (see also [[Risk]]). The [[somatic marker hypothesis]] is a [[Neurobiology|neurobiological]] theory of how decisions are made in the face of uncertain outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reimann |first1=Martin |last2=Bechara |first2=Antoine |date=October 2010 |title=The somatic marker framework as a neurological theory of decision-making: review, conceptual comparisons, and future neuroeconomics research |journal=[[Journal of Economic Psychology]] |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=767–776 |doi=10.1016/j.joep.2010.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory holds that such decisions are aided by emotions, in the form of bodily states, that are elicited during the deliberation of future consequences and that mark different options for behavior as being advantageous or disadvantageous. This process involves an interplay between neural systems that elicit emotional/bodily states and neural systems that map these emotional/bodily states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Naqvi |first1=Nasir |last2=Shiv |first2=Baba |last3=Bechara |first3=Antoine |date=October 2006 |title=The role of emotion in decision making: a cognitive neuroscience perspective |journal=[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=260–264 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00448.x |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228449030|citeseerx=10.1.1.137.4677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent lesion mapping study of 152 patients with focal brain lesions conducted by [[Aron K.

== In adolescents vs. adults ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}

During their adolescent years, teens are known for their high-risk behaviors and rash decisions. Recent research{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} has shown that there are differences in cognitive processes between adolescents and adults during decision-making. Researchers have concluded that differences in decision-making are not due to a lack of logic or reasoning, but more due to the immaturity of [[psychosocial]] capacities that influence decision-making. Examples of their undeveloped capacities which influence decision-making would be impulse control, emotion regulation, [[delayed gratification]] and resistance to [[peer pressure]]. In the past, researchers have thought that adolescent behavior was simply due to incompetency regarding decision-making. Currently, researchers have concluded that adults and adolescents are both competent decision-makers, not just adults. However, adolescents' competent decision-making skills decrease when psychosocial capacities become present.

Recent research{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} has shown that risk-taking behaviors in adolescents may be the product of interactions between the socioemotional brain network and its [[Executive functions|cognitive-control network]]. The socioemotional part of the brain processes social and emotional stimuli and has been shown to be important in [[Reward system|reward processing]]. The cognitive-control network assists in planning and self-regulation. Both of these sections of the brain change over the course of [[puberty]]. However, the socioemotional network changes quickly and abruptly, while the cognitive-control network changes more gradually. Because of this difference in change, the cognitive-control network, which usually regulates the socioemotional network, struggles to control the socioemotional network when psychosocial capacities are present.{{clarify|date=January 2014}}

When adolescents are exposed to social and emotional stimuli, their socioemotional network is activated as well as areas of the brain involved in reward processing. Because teens often gain a sense of reward from risk-taking behaviors, their repetition becomes ever more probable due to the reward experienced. In this, the process mirrors [[addiction]]. Teens can become addicted to risky behavior because they are in a high state of arousal and are rewarded for it not only by their own internal functions but also by their peers around them.

Adults are generally better able to control their risk-taking because their cognitive-control system has matured enough to the point where it can control the socioemotional network, even in the context of high arousal or when psychosocial capacities are present. Also, adults are less likely to find themselves in situations that push them to do risky things. For example, teens are more likely to be around peers who peer pressure them into doing things, while adults are not as exposed to this sort of social setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Margo |last2=Steinberg | authorlink2 = Laurence Steinberg  |first2=Laurence |date=July 2005 |title=Peer influence on risk taking, risk preference, and risky decision making in adolescence and adulthood: an experimental study |journal=[[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=625–635 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.4.625 |pmid=16060809 |url=http://uwf.edu/smathews/documents/peerroleinrisktakinggardnerandsteinberg.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.556.4973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steinberg | authorlink = Laurence Steinberg |first=Laurence |date=April 2007 |title=Risk taking in adolescence: new perspectives from brain and behavioral science |journal=[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=55–59 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00475.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.519.7099 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study suggests that adolescents have difficulties adequately adjusting beliefs in response to bad news (such as reading that smoking poses a greater risk to health than they thought), but do not differ from adults in their ability to alter beliefs in response to good news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moutsiana |first1=Christina |last2=Garrett |first2=Neil |last3=Clarke |first3=Richard C. |last4=Lotto |first4=R.

'''Edith Irby Jones''' (born December 23, 1927) is an American physician who was the first [[African American]] to be accepted as a non-segregated student at the [[University of Arkansas]] Medical School and the first black student to attend racially mixed classes in the [[Southern United States|American South]]. She was the first African American to graduate from a southern medical school, first black intern in the state of Arkansas, and later first black intern at [[Baylor College of Medicine]]. Jones was the first woman president of the [[National Medical Association]]. She has been honored by many awards, including induction into both the University of Arkansas College of Medicine Hall of Fame and the inaugural group of women inducted into the [[Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame]].

==Biography==
Edith Mae Irby was born on December 23, 1927, near [[Conway, Arkansas|Conway]] in [[Faulkner County, Arkansas]], to Mattie (née Buice) and Robert Irby. At the age of eight, she lost her father, an older sister died at 12 years of age from [[typhoid fever]], and Irby herself suffered from [[rheumatic fever]] as a child. These were motivating factors in her desire to help those who were underserved and impoverished and which propelled her toward a career in medicine. Her mother relocated the family to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], where Irby graduated from Langston Secondary School in 1944. After winning a scholarship, she studied chemistry, biology and physics at [[Knoxville College]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Edith Irby Jones|url=http://www.arwomenshalloffame.com/#/edith-jones/|publisher=Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame|accessdate=December 26, 2015|location=Little Rock, Arkansas|date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irby was well aware of the role she was playing and obligation she had for the black community. One of her teachers had helped her attain the scholarship, members of the local African American community collected change and the black press ran a campaign in the ''[[Daisy Bates (civil rights activist)#Arkansas State Press|Arkansas State-Press]]'' which they donated to help with her tuition and living expenses.&lt;ref name="National Library of Medicine bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Edith Irby Jones|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_175.html|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=December 26, 2015|location=Bethesda, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her schooling, she secretly made trips with teams of workers from the [[NAACP]] to enroll members for the organization.{{sfn|More|1999|p=237}} She graduated with her BS from Knoxville College in 1948 and then completed a graduate course at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]] to prepare for Medical School.&lt;ref name="graduation 1952"&gt;{{cite news|title=University to Graduate First Negro Student|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3893535/university_to_graduate_first_negro/|accessdate= December 26, 2015|work=Hope Star|date=May 19, 1952|location=Hope, Arkansas|page=3|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) was founded in 1985 by [[Saad Eddin Ibrahim]] and [[Hani Shukrallah]].&lt;ref&gt;Beinin, 2011, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first human rights organization in the country and remains one of the most professional non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Egypt. Its headquarters is in Cairo, and has regional branches with a national membership of approximately 2,300 active volunteers in 17 provincial branches located across the country.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; EOHR is a non-profit NGO working within the framework of the principles established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other [[international human rights instruments]] regardless of the identity or affiliation of the victim or violator .

EOHR acts and reports on both governmental and non-governmental human rights violations. According to its reports issues annually the decade of the late 1980s through to the late 1990s was marked by an increase in torture in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHp4lsrx92AC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22+Egyptian+Organization+for+Human+Rights%22+1985&amp;num=100&amp;ei=WnRtS6iFM4fsyASLneStDg&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20Egyptian%20Organization%20for%20Human%20Rights%22%201985&amp;f=false |title=Dictionary of human rights advocacy ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=January 1, 1997 |accessdate=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rjj48T4zrb8C&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22+Egyptian+Organization+for+Human+Rights%22+1985&amp;num=100&amp;ei=WnRtS6iFM4fsyASLneStDg&amp;cd=18#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20Egyptian%20Organization%20for%20Human%20Rights%22%201985&amp;f=false |title=Passion for Islam: Shaping the ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the organization's activists were regularly harassed and arrested making their work increasingly difficult. Despite these challenges the organization maintained a steady accounting of state and non-state violations of human rights and started a series of publications of human rights books to raise awareness of human rights issues in the country. An attempt to start a theater company to tour villages with plays improvised on human rights topics was scrapped after the organizer was arrested by state security forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karim Alrawi|Karim Alrawi, see section heading "Arrest and Detention"]]&lt;/ref&gt; During the last decade of the Mubarak dictatorship the EOHR was represented, while maintaining its independence, on the state sponsored Supreme Council of Human Rights.

==EOHR's international status==
EOHR is part of the wider international and Arab human rights movement. It cooperates with the United Nations human rights bodies, as well as with other international and regional human rights organizations. EOHR was registered at the Ministry of Social Affairs in 2003 under registration No. 5220/2003.

EOHR was granted special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council in 2006. This consultative status enables EOHR to enjoy closer interaction with the United Nations by participating in the activities of the International Council for Human Rights, according to ECOSOC decision 31/1996. This decision aimed to reinforce the principles of the human rights stipulated in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the Vienna Declaration and all other international human rights documents. EOHR is also a member of five international organizations: the [[Arab Organization for Human Rights]] (AOHR), the [[World Organisation Against Torture]] (OMCT), [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (IFHR), the [[International Commission of Jurists]] (ICJ), and the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] (IFEX).

==Goals==
# To provide full respect for human rights and the basic freedoms of all Egyptians and non-Egyptians who are in Egypt, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. These include, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. EOHR defends the human rights of all individuals and groups against all forms of violation.
# To reform the Egyptian constitution and legislation to bring them into accordance with international human rights covenants and conventions.
# To promote the rule of law and full respect for an independent judiciary.
# To guarantee the right to participation in public affairs without discrimination due to opinion, religion, gender, race or color.
# To guarantee freedom of opinion and expression, in addition to artistic and literary invention.
# To guarantee freedom of belief, thought and religion.
# To ensure a fair trial for all defendants before a competent judge regardless of the kind of charge. To grant legal aid to those defendants if possible and necessary.
# To call for the release of those who are detained, or whose freedoms are restricted, due to the peaceful expression of their opinions or because of their beliefs, religion, race, gender or color.
# To provide legal aid to the victims of violations against the freedom of opinion and expression. In addition, to assist prisoners and detainees who are subject to torture or other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
# To ensure that prison regulations and the treatment of prisoners are in conformity with the international Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.

==Working methods==
EOHR adopts peaceful methods to promote and defend human rights. It believes that the promotion of human rights is a common goal for the entire world community and it is determined to spare no peaceful effort in its struggle against human rights violations. His main actions are:

# Monitoring, observing and documenting the human rights violation and informing the official bodies about the violation incidents.
# Issuing press releases on the human rights violations.
# Providing legal support for the human rights'  violation victims.
# Holding open discussions on the Egyptian laws in order to comply with the international covenants of human rights. 
# Launching specific and specialized campaigns for raising awareness of the human rights issues. 
# Providing training for media and legal specialists on the human rights principles.
# Holding training workshops for EOHR members and others for raising awareness of human rights.
# Preparing researches on the human rights issues.
# Holding an annual meeting for discussing human rights' issues.
The EOHR accomplishes this by fact-finding missions. These include visits to prisons in order to collect testimonies, and to obtain document information about human rights violations. It also Issues urgent appeals, press releases, reports and publications on human rights violations. Furthermore, the EOHR tries to raise awareness on human rights issues among individuals and groups through publications, conferences, seminars and studies. In addition, this organization contacts Egyptian governmental and non-governmental bodies as well as international, regional and national organizations to seek co-operation, obtain information and take action to increase respect for human rights. Through the use of these methods the EOHR has adopted a peaceful method to promote and defend human rights in Egypt.

==Organizational structure==
The General Assembly of fee-paying members holds supreme authority in EOHR. A General Assembly meeting is convened once every other year to review and evaluate the organization’s progress and to elect the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is the policy-making body within the EOHR and is led by the Chairman. It is made up of fifteen elected members, and up to four other prominent figures in the field of human rights can be invited by the Board of Trustees to join.

The Executive Board is elected by the Board of Trustees and consists of the Secretary-General, the Treasurer and representatives of the main committees of the organization. The Executive Board, led by the Secretary-General, is responsible for the day-to-day activities of the EOHR and for any decisions made in the interim period between meetings of the Board of Trustees.

EOHR has five substantive and inter-linked units, two projects and three auxiliary units:

The investigating lawyer writes an official report on each case. Then, depending on the nature and the merits of the case, the case may be removed from consideration or investigated further. Appeals and requests for information may be made to competent authorities and complainants may receive free legal counsel so that they can pursue a formal suit. All services made available to victims of human rights violations are absolutely free of charge.The unit does also the following:

The '''El Segundo blue''' (''Euphilotes battoides allyni'') is a [[butterfly]] local to a small dune ecosystem in [[Southern California]] that [[Abandoned village|used to be a community]] called [[Palisades del Rey, California|Palisades del Rey]], close to the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Butterflies at LAX|url=https://www.airportparkingmarket.co.uk/rare-butterflies-at-lax/|website=Airport Parking Market|publisher=Airport Parking Market|accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 it became a federally designated [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;Traci Watson:[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160421-butterflies-endangered-species-animals/ Rare Butterflies Flying High at Los Angeles Airport], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], 21 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The El Segundo Blue Butterfly Habitat Preserve next to LAX exists to protect the species. There are only three colonies of this tiny butterfly still in existence.  The largest of these is on the grounds of LAX; a further colony exists on a site within the huge [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] El Segundo oil refinery complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do|url=http://elsegundo.chevron.com/abouttherefinery/whatwedo/default.aspx|website=Chevron|publisher=Chevron|accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the smallest colony is an area of only a few square yards on a local beach. The butterfly lays its eggs on [[Eriogonum parvifolium|coast buckwheat]], which the adults also use as a [[nectar]] source.  Recently, some nearby beach cities such as [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] have replaced [[Aizoaceae|ice plant]] growth near the beaches with coast buckwheat, in order to provide the butterflies with more of their natural food source.

{{Sociology}}
{{Feminism sidebar|Theory}}
'''Feminist sociology''' is a [[conflict theory]] and theoretical perspective which observes [[gender]] in its relation to power, both at the level of [[face-to-face interaction]] and [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] within a [[social structure]] at large. Focuses include [[sexual orientation]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social stratification|economic status]], and [[nationality]].

At the core of feminist sociology is the idea of the systemic [[oppression]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A phenomenon derived from prehistoric-human social- behavioral patterns, specifically regarding the (Fe)Male relationship; as well as significant gender differentiation in terms of physical and mental attributes. This Idea of origin is Key to the progression of 'equalist' ideals, which have grown to engulf a number of socially important injustices, yet is often not realized in the Psyche of the individual and thus not beheld, conceptually by public; possibly due to the absence of a cross-conceptual, analytical thinking pattern.{{Original research inline|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of women and the historical dominance of men within most societies: '[[patriarchy]]'. [[Feminist]] thought has a rich history, however, which may be categorized into three 'waves'. The current, '[[third wave feminism|third wave]]', emphasizes the concepts of [[globalization]], [[postcolonialism]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Contemporary feminist thought has frequently tended to do-away with all generalizations regarding sex and gender, closely linked with [[antihumanism]], [[posthumanism]], [[queer theory]] and the work of [[Michel Foucault]].

'''[[Feminist theory]]-''' [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]](1860-1935) was a women ahead of her time who work and research would help formalize "feminist theory during the 1960s. Growing up she went against traditional holds that were placed on her by society by focusing on reading and learning concepts different than women who were taught to be a housewife. Her main focus was on gender inequality between men and women along with gender roles placed on my society. Where men go to work secure proper income for the family while women stay at home and tend to the family along with house hold chores.  She "emphasized how differential socialization leads to gender inequality". Yet, she did agree that biologically there is different between those born with female and male parts. 

Parts of her research involves a theoretical orientation of a multidimensional approach to gender and discusses more in depth in her book ''Women and Economics''. Due to gender roles she believes that women pretend to live a certain life to avoid achieving their full potential living the role of a housewife. This is an example of falling under [[False consciousness|false consciousness]] instead of "true" consciousness. Leading the belief that women are viewed as property towards their husbands because despite their own work they may do; economically women were still dependent on husbands to provide financial support to themselves and their family. She also stated that the traditional division of labor was not biologically driven , but instead pushed upon based structure of how society was established since before the 19th century. 

In the end Gilman describes it as ''sociobiological'' tragedy because women are disregarded as being part of the ideology of "survival of the fittest". Instead females are thought to be soft and weak individuals that are only good for productive reasons. Females are depicted as emotional and frail human beings who are born to serve their husbands, children, and family without living for herself. Gilman's research was conducted during a time where women being a sociologist were unheard of; she lived during a time that women couldn't even vote. Her research helps create a ripple effect along with other female sociologists that help paved wave for feminism, feminist, and concepts to correlate with feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociological Theory in the Classical Era|last=Edles|first=Laura|last2=Appelrouth|publisher=Pine Forge Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4129-7564-3|location=|pages=9,222-255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexism

[[Heterosexism]] is a system of attitudes, bias, and [[discrimination]] in favour of male-female [[sexuality]] and relationships.
Heterosexism describes a set of [[paradigms]] and institutionalized beliefs that systematically disadvantage anyone other than heterosexual, which can stem from personal beliefs, societal institutions and or a country's government. For example, heterosexual [[marriage]] has been or is the only lawful union between two people that was or is fully recognized and subsequently given full benefits in many countries. This has acted to greatly disadvantage people in same-sex relationships within society as compared with those in different-sex relationships.

==Feminism and race==
Women who suffer from oppression due to race may find themselves in a [[double bind]]. The relationship between feminism and race was largely overlooked until the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminists]] produced greater literature on the topic of '[[black feminism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Mahony, Pat, and Christine Zmroczek. Class matters: 'working-class' women's perspectives on social class. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Julia Cooper]] and [[Ida Bell Wells-Barnett]] are African American women who were instrumental in conducting much research and making valuable contributions in the field of black feminism.  "Cooper and Wells-Barnett both consciously drew on their lived experiences as African American women to develop a "systematic consciousness of society and social relations."  As such, these women foreshadow the development of a feminist sociological theory based in the interests of women of colour."&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer George and Goodman Douglas (2004) Classical Sociological Theory, Fourth Ed.  p.294&lt;/ref&gt;

An instrumental contribution to the field was [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]]'s seminal 1989 paper, "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex:A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics" (Crenshaw 1989)&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, K. 1989. "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics". University of Chicago Legal Forum: Vol. 1989: Iss. 1, Article 8.&lt;/ref&gt;. In it she outlines the manner in which black women have been erased from feminist pedagogy. Black women must be understood as having multiple identities that intersect and reinforce one another, the two key experiences of being black and of being women. Furthermore, black women suffer on both racist and sexist fronts, marginalized not only by larger systems of oppression but by existing feminist discourse that disregards their [[intersectionality]]. Crenshaw's work is integral to understanding feminist sociology, as it advocated for black feminist thought and set the building blocks for future feminist sociologists such as [[Patricia Hill Collins]]. 

==Feminism and queer theory==
Modern queer theory attempts to unmake the social and contextual elements reinforcing [[heteronormativity]] by challenging oppressive institutions on traditional binary distinctions between male and female, among its many other criticisms. In this regard, feminism and queer theory address the same ways social structures violently categorize and erase women and LGBTQIA+ from the social narrative. However, sociological feminism often reinforces the gender binary through the research process "as the gendered subject is made the object of the study" (McCann 2016, 229). In her recent work "Epistemology of the Subject: Queer Theory's Challenge to Feminist Sociology"&lt;ref&gt;McCann, H. 2016. "Epistemology of the Subject: Queer Theory's Challenge to Feminist Sociology". WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly, Volume 44, Numbers 3 &amp; 4, Fall/Winter 2016, pp. 224-243.&lt;/ref&gt;, McCann confronts the theoretical perspective and methodology of feminist sociology:"[the subject] rarely reflects the fluid, unstable, and dynamic realities of bodies and experiences. To “settle” on a subject category, then, is to reinscribe a fixity that excludes some, often in violent ways (for example, those who are literally erased because their bodies do not conform to a discrete binary)" (McCann 2016, 231-232). There can be a refashioning of the field, where extending boundaries to include queer theory would "develop new and innovative theoretical approaches to research...[and] address inequality within society" (McCann 2016, 237). 

==Feminist critiques of multiculturalism==
Debates within [[ethnic relations]], particularly regarding the opposing perspectives of [[assimilationism]] and [[multiculturalism]], have led to the accusation that feminism is incompatible with multiculturalist policy. The remit of multiculturalism is to allow distinct cultures to reside in Western societies, or separate societies in general, and one possible consequence is that certain religious or traditional practices may negate Western feminist ideals. Central debates include the topics of [[arranged marriage]] and [[female genital mutilation]]. Others have argued that these debates stem from Western [[orientalism]] and general political reluctance to accept foreign migrants.

'''Holistic management''' (from {{lang|grc|ὅλος}} ''holos'', a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning ''all'', ''whole'', ''entire'', ''total'') in agriculture is a [[systems thinking]] approach to managing resources that was originally developed by [[Allan Savory]] for reversing [[desertification]].&lt;ref name="greenbiz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coughlin|first=Chrissy|title=Allan Savory: How livestock can protect the land|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2013/03/10/allan-savory-how-livestock-can-protect-land|publisher=GreenBiz|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the Africa Centre for Holistic Management in Zimbabwe, Operation Hope (a "[[proof of concept]]" project using holistic management) was named the winner of the 2010 [[Buckminster Fuller Challenge]] for "recognizing initiatives which take a comprehensive, anticipatory, design approach to radically advance human well being and the health of our planet's ecosystems".&lt;ref name="challenge"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Challenge Winner: Operation Hope: Permanent water and food security for Africa's impoverished millions|url=http://challenge.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2010/operation-hope|publisher=bfi.org|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thackara|first=John|title=Greener Pastures|url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/Greener_Pastures/|publisher=Seed Magazine|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothstein|first=Joe|title=Hang On, Planet Earth, Help Is On The Way|url=http://uspolitics.einnews.com/column/57081276/hang-on-planet-earth-help-is-on-the-way-joe-rothstein-s-commentary|publisher=EIN News|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beginnings ==
The idea of holistic planned [[grazing]] began in the 1960s when [[Allan Savory]], a wildlife biologist in his native [[Southern Rhodesia]], set out to understand [[desertification]]. This can be seen in the context of the larger [[environmental movement]]. Heavily influenced by the work of [[André Voisin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Voisin|first= André |authorlink= |title=Grass Productivity | date=1 December 1988 |origyear=1959 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-0933280649 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voisin|first=André, Antoine Lecomte|title=Rational grazing, the meeting of cow and grass: a manual of grass productivity|year=1962|publisher=C. Lockwood LTD, London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ineffectiveness of mainstream [[rangeland]] science of the time, Savory concluded that the spread of deserts, the loss of wildlife, and the human impoverishment that always resulted were related to the reduction of the natural [[herds]] of large grazers and even more, the change in behavior of those few remaining herds.&lt;ref name="greenbiz" /&gt; [[Livestock]] could be substituted to provide important [[ecosystem services]] like nutrient [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycling]] when [[Biomimicry|mimicking]]&lt;ref name="Benyus 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Benyus |first=Janine |title=Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature |year=1997 |publisher=[[William Morrow &amp; Company]], Inc. |location=New York, NY, USA |isbn=978-0-688-16099-9 |ref=Benyus97}}&lt;/ref&gt; those uniquely coevolved grasses and grazers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Retallack|first=Gregory|title=Cenozoic Expansion of Grasslands and Climatic Cooling|url=http://blogs.uoregon.edu/gregr/files/2013/07/grasslandscooling-nhslkh.pdf|work=The University of Chicago|publisher=The Journal of Geology|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Voisin|first= André |authorlink= |title=Grass Productivity | date=1 December 1988 |origyear=1959 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-0933280649 |page=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Pastures for profit: A guide to rotational grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/A3529.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin Extension|accessdate=5 April 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; But managers had found that while [[rotational grazing]] systems can work for diverse management purposes, scientific experiments had demonstrated that they do not necessarily work for specific [[ecological]] purposes. An adaptive management plan was needed for the integration of the [[experience|experiential]] with the [[experimental]], as well as the [[social]] with the [[biophysical]], to provide a more comprehensive framework for the management of rangeland systems.&lt;ref&gt;D. D. Briske, Nathan F. Sayre, L. Huntsinger, M. Fernandez-Gimenez, B. Budd, and J. D. Derner, Origin, Persistence, and Resolution of the Rotational Grazing Debate: Integrating Human Dimensions Into Rangeland Research, Rangeland Ecology &amp; Management 2011 64:4, 325-334&lt;/ref&gt; None of these sources of knowledge could be understood except in the context of the whole. [[holism|Holistic]] management was developed to meet that need.

== Development ==
In many regions, [[pastoralism]] and communal land use are blamed for [[human ecology|environmental]] degradation caused by [[overgrazing]]. After years of research and experience, Savory came to understand this assertion was often wrong, and that sometimes removing animals actually made it worse.&lt;ref name="challenge" /&gt; This concept is a variation of the [[trophic cascade]], where humans are seen as the top level predator and the cascade follows from there.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I have been particularly fascinated, for example, by the work of a remarkable man called Allan Savory, in Zimbabwe and other [[semi arid]] areas, who has argued for years against the prevailing expert view that is the simple numbers of cattle that drive overgrazing and cause fertile land to become desert. On the contrary, as he has since shown so graphically, the land needs the presence of feeding animals and their droppings for the cycle to be complete, so that soils and grassland areas stay productive.

Savory developed a flexible management system designed to improve grazing systems. Holistic planned grazing is one of a number of newer grazing management systems that more closely simulate the behavior of natural herds of wildlife and have been shown to improve [[riparian]] habitats and water quality over systems that often led to [[land degradation]], and be an effective tool to improve range condition for both livestock and [[wildlife]].&lt;ref name="challenge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dagget|first=Dan ; with photography by Tom Bean|title=Gardeners of Eden : rediscovering our importance to nature|year=2005|publisher=Thatcher Charitable Trust|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9780966622911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weber|first1=K T|last2=Gokhale|first2=B S|title=Effect of grazing on soil-water content in semiarid rangelands of southeast Idaho|url=http://giscenter.isu.edu/research/projects/jae_soilmoisture.pdf|website=Elsevier|publisher=Journal of Arid Environments|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartz|first=Judith D.|title=Greener Pastures|url=http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2011/06/greener-pastures/|work=Conservation Magazine|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salatin|first=Joel|title=Tall grass mob stocking|url=http://www.acresusa.com/toolbox/reprints/May08_Salatin.pdf|work=Acres USA May 2008 vol 8 no 5|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111035028/http://www.acresusa.com/toolbox/reprints/May08_Salatin.pdf|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

== Framework ==
The holistic management decision-making framework uses six key steps to guide the management of resources:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Putting Holistic Management In Place|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/works/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111074423/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/works/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 January 2012|work=Savory Institute|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Preston|title=Holistic Management: A Whole-Farm Decision Making Framework|url=https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/summaries/summary.php?pub=296|work=The National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service - ATTRA|publisher=National Center for Appropriate Technology (NCAT)|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Define in its entirety what you are managing. No area should be treated as a single-product system. By defining the whole, people are better able to manage. This includes identifying the available resources, including [[money management|money]], that the manager has at his disposal.
#Define what you want now and for the future. Set the objectives, goals and actions needed to produce the [[quality of life]] sought, and what the [[Mother nature|life-nurturing environment]] must be like to sustain that quality of life far into the future.
#Watch for the earliest indicators of ecosystem health. Identify the ecosystem services that have deep impacts for people in both urban and rural environments, and find a way to easily monitor them. One of the best examples of an early indicator of a poorly functioning environment is patches of bare ground. An indicator of a better functioning environment is newly sprouting diversity of plants and a return or increase of wildlife.
#Don't limit the management tools you use. The eight tools for managing natural resources are money/labor, human creativity, grazing, animal impact, fire, rest, living organisms and [[Agricultural science|science]]/technology. To be successful you need to use all these tools to the best of your ability.
#Test your decisions with questions that are designed to help ensure all your decisions are socially, environmentally and financially sound for both the short and long term.
#Monitor [[Proactivity|proactively]], before your managed system becomes more imbalanced. This way the manager can take adaptive corrective action quickly, before the ecosystem services are lost. Always assume your plan is less than perfect and use a [[feedback loop]] that includes monitoring for the earliest signs of failure, adjusting and re-planning as needed. In other words, use a "[[wikt:canary in a coal mine|canary in a coal mine]]" adaptive approach.

== Four principles ==
Holistic management planned grazing has four key principles that take advantage of the [[symbiotic]] relationship between large herds of grazing animals, their [[predator]]s and the grasslands that support them:&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Principles of Holistic Management, Empowering Caretakers of the Land|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/principles-of-holistic-management/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109072440/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/principles-of-holistic-management/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 January 2012|work=Savory Institute|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Nature functions as a [[holistic community]] with a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship between people, animals and the land. If you remove or change the behavior of any [[keystone species]] like the large grazing herds, you have an unexpected and wide-ranging negative impact on other areas of the environment.
#It is absolutely crucial that any agricultural planning system must be flexible enough to adapt to [[Complex systems|nature’s complexity]], since all environments are different and have constantly changing local conditions.
#[[Animal husbandry]] using [[Domestication|domestic species]] can be used as a substitute for lost keystone species. Thus when managed properly in a way that mimics nature, agriculture can heal the land and even benefit wildlife, while at the same time benefiting people.
#Time and timing is the most important factor when planning land use. Not only is it crucial to understand how long to use the land for agriculture and how long to rest, it is equally important to understand exactly when and where the land is ready for that use and rest.

== Criticism ==
Claims that holistic grazing can have a profound effect on climate change by making grazing cattle carbon negative have no basis in any peer-reviewed scientific literature and are based on literature only available on the Savory Institute website. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2014/aug/04/eat-more-meat-and-save-the-world-the-latest-implausible-farming-miracle|title=Eat more meat and save the world: the latest implausible farming miracle {{!}} George Monbiot|last=Monbiot|first=George|date=2014-08-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|The [[Three Gorges Dam]] in Central China is the [[List of largest power stations in the world#Top 20 largest power producing facilities|world's largest]] power producing facility of any kind.]]
{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Hydroelectricity''' is [[Electricity generation|electricity produced]] from [[hydropower]]. In 2015, hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all [[renewable energy|renewable electricity]],&lt;ref name="ren21.net"&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the [[Asia-Pacific]] region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013. [[China]] is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 920 TWh of production in 2013, representing 16.9 percent of domestic electricity use.

The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 [[megawatt]]s is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per [[kilowatt-hour]].&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and in many cases, has a considerably lower output level of [[greenhouse gas]]es than [[fossil fuel]] powered energy plants.&lt;ref name="REN21-2011"&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR2011_FINAL.pdf Renewables 2011 Global Status Report, page 25, Hydropower], ''[[REN21]]'', published 2011, accessed 2016-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks. In the mid-1770s, French engineer [[Bernard Forest de Bélidor]] published ''Architecture Hydraulique'' which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines. By the late 19th century, the [[electrical generator]] was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics.&lt;ref name="doehis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/history-hydropower|title=History of Hydropower|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing demand for the [[Industrial Revolution]] would drive development as well.&lt;ref name="watenc"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878 the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at [[Cragside]] in [[Northumberland]], England by [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]]. It was used to power a single [[arc lamp]] in his art gallery.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The old [[Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station#Origins|Schoelkopf Power Station No. 1]] near [[Niagara Falls]] in the U.S. side began to produce electricity in 1881. The first [[Thomas Alva Edison|Edison]] hydroelectric power station, the [[Vulcan Street Plant]], began operating September 30, 1882, in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.clara.net/darvill/altenerg/hydro.htm|title= Hydroelectric power - energy from falling water|publisher=Clara.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1886 there were 45 hydroelectric power stations in the U.S. and Canada. By 1889 there were 200 in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name="doehis"/&gt;

[[File:Warwick Castle - Engine House, Waterwheel, Weir, and Old Castle Bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Warwick Castle]] water-powered generator house, used for the generation of electricity for the castle from 1894 until 1940]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas. [[Grenoble]], France held the [[International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism]] with over one million visitors. By 1920 as 40% of the power produced in the United States was hydroelectric, the [[Federal Power Act]] was enacted into law. The Act created the [[Federal Power Commission]] to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water. As the power stations became larger, their associated dams developed additional purposes to include [[flood control]], [[irrigation]] and [[navigable|navigation]]. Federal funding became necessary for large-scale development and federally owned corporations, such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (1933) and the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] (1937) were created.&lt;ref name="watenc"/&gt; Additionally, the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] which had begun a series of western U.S. irrigation projects in the early 20th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the 1928 [[Boulder Canyon Project Act|Hoover Dam]].&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boulder Canyon Project Act|url=http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/bcpact.pdf|date=December 21, 1928|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613142851/http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/bcpact.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] was also involved in hydroelectric development, completing the [[Bonneville Dam]] in 1937 and being recognized by the [[Flood Control Act of 1936]] as the premier federal flood control agency.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;[http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-29/entire.pdf The Evolution of the Flood Control Act of 1936, Joseph L.

Hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the 20th century. Hydropower was referred to as ''white coal'' for its power and plenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Book of Knowledge|volume=Vol. 9|page=3220|edition=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoover Dam]]'s initial 1,345 MW power station was the world's largest hydroelectric power station in 1936; it was eclipsed by the 6809 MW [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2zlasvegas.com/otherside/sights/hoover.html|title=Hoover Dam and Lake Mead|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Reclamation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Itaipu Dam]] opened in 1984 in South America as the largest, producing 14,000 MW but was surpassed in 2008 by the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China at 22,500 MW. Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries, including [[Norway]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Brazil]], with over 85% of their electricity. The United States currently has over 2,000 hydroelectric power stations that supply 6.4% of its total electrical production output, which is 49% of its renewable electricity.&lt;ref name="watenc"/&gt;

==Future potential==
The technical potential for the growth of hydropower around the world are, 71% Europe, 75% North America, 79% South America, 95% Africa, 95% Middle East, 82% Asia Pacific. 
The political realities of new reservoirs in western countries, economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas, result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before 2050, with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A few countries are highly developed and have very little room for growth, Switzerland 12% and Mexico 20%.

[[File:Hydroelectric dam.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Cross section of a conventional hydroelectric dam.]]

[[File:Water turbine - edit1.svg|thumb|A typical [[Water turbine|turbine]] and [[electrical generator|generator]]]]

===Conventional (dams)===
{{See also|List of conventional hydroelectric power stations}}

Most hydroelectric power comes from the [[potential energy]] of [[dam]]med water driving a [[water turbine]] and [[electric generator|generator]]. The power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water's outflow. This height difference is called the [[head (hydraulic)|head]]. A large pipe (the "[[penstock]]") delivers water from the [[reservoir]] to the turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricityforum.com/hydroelectricity.html|title=hydro electricity - explained|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumped-storage===
{{Main article|Pumped-storage hydroelectricity}}
{{See also|List of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations}}

This method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between [[reservoir]]s at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir. When the demand becomes greater, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine. Pumped-storage schemes currently provide the most commercially important means of large-scale [[grid energy storage]] and improve the daily [[capacity factor]] of the generation system. Pumped storage is not an energy source, and appears as a negative number in listings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesouthslope.com/content/pumped-storage-explained Pumped Storage, Explained] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231233454/http://thesouthslope.com/content/pumped-storage-explained |date=2012-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Run-of-the-river===
{{Main article|Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity}}
{{See also|List of run-of-the-river hydroelectric power stations}}

Run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity, so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment, and any oversupply must pass unused. A constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river. In the United States, run of the river hydropower could potentially provide {{convert|60000|MW}} (about 13.7% of total use in 2011 if continuously available).&lt;!--total use in 2011 was 3841 billion kWh from Annual Energy Outlook http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/er/ --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/01/run-of-the-river-hydropower-goes-with-the-flow|title=Run-of-the-River Hydropower Goes With the Flow|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tide===
{{Main article|Tide power}}
{{See also|List of tidal power stations}}

A [[tidal power]] station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides; such sources are highly predictable, and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs, can also be [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] to generate power during high demand periods. Less common types of hydro schemes use water's [[kinetic energy]] or undammed sources such as undershot [[water wheel]]s. Tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world. In Great Britain, there are eight sites that could be developed, which 
have the potential to generate 20% of the electricity used in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darvill.clara.net/altenerg/tidal.htm|title=Energy Resources: Tidal power|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sizes, types and capacities of hydroelectric facilities==

=== Large facilities ===
{{See also|List of largest power stations in the world|List of largest hydroelectric power stations}}

Large-scale hydroelectric power stations are more commonly seen as the largest power producing facilities in the world, with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current [[List of nuclear power stations|largest nuclear power stations]].

Although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations, facilities from over a few hundred [[megawatt]]s are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities.

Currently, only four facilities over {{nowrap|10 [[Gigawatt|GW]]}} ({{nowrap|10,000 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}) are in operation worldwide, see table below.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

===Small===
{{Main article|Small hydro}}

Small hydro is the development of [[hydroelectric power]] on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant. The definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to 10 [[megawatt]]s (MW) is generally accepted as the upper limit of what can be termed small hydro. This may be stretched to 25 MW and 30 MW in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Small-scale hydroelectricity production grew by 29% from 2005 to 2008, raising the total world small-hydro capacity to {{nowrap|85 [[Gigawatt|GW]]}}. Over 70% of this was in [[China]] ({{nowrap|65 GW}}), followed by [[Japan]] ({{nowrap|3.5 GW}}), the United States ({{nowrap|3 GW}}), and [[India]] ({{nowrap|2 GW}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf Renewables Global Status Report 2006 Update] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |date=July 18, 2011 }}, ''[[REN21]]'', published 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nw vietnam hydro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A micro-hydro facility in [[Vietnam]]]]
[[File:Amateur Hydroelectricity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Pico hydroelectricity in [[Mondulkiri]], [[Cambodia]]]]
Small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy. Alternatively, small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a network, or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network. Since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro. This decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production.

===Micro===
{{Main article|Micro hydro}}

Micro hydro is a term used for [[hydroelectric power]] installations that typically produce up to {{nowrap|100 [[Kilowatt|kW]]}} of power. These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks. There are many of these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |title=Micro Hydro in the fight against poverty |publisher=Tve.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426092643/http://tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micro hydro systems complement [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] solar energy systems because in many areas, water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum.

===Pico===
{{Main article|Pico hydro}}

Pico hydro is a term used for [[hydroelectric power]] generation of under {{nowrap|5 [[Kilowatt|kW]]}}. It is useful in small, remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity. For example, to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a TV or radio for a few homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx|title=Pico Hydro Power|publisher=T4cd.org|accessdate=2010-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731064419/http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx|archivedate=2009-07-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even smaller turbines of 200-300W may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only {{Convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. A Pico-hydro setup is typically [[#Run-of-the-river|run-of-the-river]], meaning that dams are not used, but rather pipes divert some of the flow, drop this down a gradient, and through the turbine before returning it to the stream.

===Underground===
{{Main article|Underground power station}}

An [[underground power station]] is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways, such as a waterfall or mountain lake. An underground tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in an underground cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway.[[File:Tailrace-Forebay-Limestone.JPG|thumb|Measurement of the tailrace and forebay rates at the [[Limestone Generating Station]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].]]

===Calculating available power===
{{Main article|Hydropower}}
A simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is: &lt;math&gt; P = \rho hrgk &lt;/math&gt;, where
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is Power in watts,
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of water (~1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),
*&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is height in meters,
*&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is flow rate in cubic meters per second,
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration due to [[gravity]] of 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1. Efficiency is often higher (that is, closer to 1) with larger and more modern turbines.

Annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply. In some installations, the water flow rate can vary by a factor of 10:1 over the course of a year.

===Advantages===
[[File:Stwlan.dam.jpg|thumb|The [[Ffestiniog Power Station]] can generate {{nowrap|360 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} of electricity within 60 seconds of the demand arising.]]

====Flexibility====
Hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydro turbines have a start-up time of the order of a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Huggins2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A.

====Low cost/high value power====
The major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for [[Dispatchable generation|dispatch later]] as high value clean electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; When used as peak power to meet demand, hydroelectricity has a higher value than base power and a much higher value compared to [[intermittent energy source]]s.

Hydroelectric stations have long economic lives, with some plants still in service after 50–100 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf Hydropower – A Way of Becoming Independent of Fossil Energy?]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528070938/http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating labor cost is also usually low, as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation.

Where a dam serves multiple purposes, a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost, providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation. It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the [[Three Gorges Dam]] will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |title=Beyond Three Gorges in China |publisher=Waterpowermagazine.com |date=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614050746/http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return, unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place.&lt;ref&gt;(http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2406852), Should We Build More Large Dams? The Actual Costs of Hydropower Megaproject Development, Energy Policy, March 2014, pp. 1-14&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suitability for industrial applications====
While many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks, some are created to serve specific [[industry|industrial]] enterprises. Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for [[aluminium]] electrolytic plants, for example. The [[Grand Coulee Dam]] switched to support [[Alcoa]] aluminium in [[Bellingham, Washington]], [[United States]] for American [[World War II]] airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens (in addition to aluminium power) after the war. In [[Suriname]], the [[Brokopondo Reservoir]] was constructed to provide electricity for the [[Alcoa]] aluminium industry. [[New Zealand]]'s [[Manapouri Power Station]] was constructed to supply electricity to the [[aluminium]] [[smelter]] at [[Comalco|Tiwai Point]].

====Reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions====
Since hydroelectric dams do not use fuel, power generation does not produce [[carbon dioxide]].  While carbon dioxide is initially produced during construction of the project, and some methane is given off annually by reservoirs, hydro in specific nordic cases, has the lowest [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions]] for power generation.&lt;ref&gt;Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions pg19&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to fossil fuels generating an equivalent amount of electricity, hydro displaced three billion tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/topics/renewables/subtopics/hydropower/&lt;/ref&gt; One measurement of greenhouse gas related and other externality comparison between energy sources can be found in the ExternE project by the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] and the [[University of Stuttgart]] which was funded by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="ExternEFTR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |title=Final Technical Report, Version 2 |author=Rabl A. et. al. |date=August 2005 |work=Externalities of Energy: Extension of Accounting Framework and Policy Applications |publisher=European Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307120342/http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that study, hydroelectricity in Europe produces the least amount of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[externality]] of any energy source.&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html|title=External costs of electricity systems (graph format)|year=2005|publisher=Technology Assessment / GaBE ([[Paul Scherrer Institut]])|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101201452/http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html|archive-date=1 November 2013|dead-url=|work=ExternE-Pol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming in second place was [[wind energy|wind]], third was [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and fourth was [[solar energy|solar]] [[photovoltaic]].&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"/&gt; The low [[greenhouse gas]] impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in [[temperate climate]]s. The above study was for local energy in [[Europe]]; presumably similar conditions prevail in North America and Northern Asia, which all see a regular, natural freeze/thaw cycle (with associated seasonal plant decay and regrowth). Greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of [[methane]] than those in temperate areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n9/full/ngeo1226.html|title=Climate science: Renewable but not carbon-free|first=Bernhard|last=Wehrli|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=4|issue=9|pages=585–586|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/ngeo1226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other uses of the reservoir====
Reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for [[List of water sports|water sports]], and become tourist attractions themselves. In some countries, [[aquaculture]] in reservoirs is common. [[Multipurpose reservoir|Multi-use dams]] installed for [[irrigation]] support [[agriculture]] with a relatively constant water supply. Large hydro dams can control floods, which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project.&lt;ref name="Water: Science and Issues"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atkins|first=William|title=Hydroelectric Power|journal=Water: Science and Issues|year=2003|volume=2|pages=187–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
{{see also|Renewable energy debate#Disadvantages of hydroelectricity}}

====Ecosystem damage and loss of land====
[[File:MeroweDam01.jpg|thumb|[[Merowe Dam]] in [[Sudan]]. Hydroelectric power stations that use [[dam]]s submerge large areas of land due to the requirement of a [[reservoir]]. These changes to land color or [[albedo]], alongside certain projects that concurrently submerge rainforests, can in these specific cases, result in the global warming impact, or equivalent [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle greenhouse gases]] of hydroelectricity projects, to exceed that of coal power stations.]]

Large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams, sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests, marshland and grasslands. Damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; The loss of land is often exacerbated by [[habitat fragmentation]] of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Paul|title=Hydropower|journal=Encyclopedia of Environment and Society|year=2007|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic [[ecosystem]]s both upstream and downstream of the plant site. Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment. Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/node/1476|title=Sedimentation Problems with Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since turbine gates are often opened intermittently, rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed.

====Water loss by evaporation====
A 2011 study by the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that hydroelectric plants in the U.S. consumed between 1,425 and 18,000 gallons of water per megawatt-hour (gal/MWh) of electricity generated, through evaporation losses in the reservoir. The median loss was 4,491 gal/MWh, which is higher than the loss for generation technologies that use cooling towers, including concentrating solar power (865 gal/MWh for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWh for CSP tower), coal (687 gal/MWh), nuclear (672 gal/MWh), and natural gas (198 gal/MWh). Where there are multiple uses of reservoirs such as water supply, recreation, and flood control,  all reservoir evaporation is attributed to power production.&lt;ref&gt;John Macknick and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies], National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Siltation and flow shortage====
When water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream. This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. [[Siltation]] can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patrick James|first=H Chansen|title=Teaching Case Studies in Reservoir Siltation and Catchment Erosion|url=http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|publisher=TEMPUS Publications|location=Great Britain|pages=265–275|year=1998|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902184753/http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|archivedate=2009-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Șentürk|first=Fuat|title=Hydraulics of dams and reservoirs|year=1994|publisher=Water Resources Publications|location=Highlands Ranch, Colo.|isbn=0-918334-80-2|edition=reference.|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=September 20, 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; One study from the [[Colorado River]] in the United States suggest that modest climate changes, such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree Celsius resulting in a 10% decline in precipitation, might reduce river run-off by up to 40%.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; [[Brazil]] in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity, as increasing temperatures, lower water ﬂow and alterations in the rainfall regime, could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

====Methane emissions (from reservoirs)====
[[File:Hoover Dam Nevada Luftaufnahme.jpg|thumb|The [[Hoover Dam]] in the [[United States]] is a large conventional dammed-hydro facility, with an installed capacity of {{nowrap|2,080 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}.]]

{{See also|Environmental impacts of reservoirs}}

Lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions, as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of [[methane]]. This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environment, and forming methane, a [[greenhouse gas]]. According to the [[World Commission on Dams]] report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dams.org/report/|title=WCD Findal Report|publisher=Dams.org|date=2000-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821120709/http://www.dams.org/report/|archivedate=2013-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046|title=Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed|publisher=Newscientist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Boreal forest|boreal]] reservoirs of Canada and Northern Europe, however, [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|greenhouse gas emissions]] are typically only 2% to 8% of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation. A new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/2006/12/01/rediscovered-wood-the-triton-sawfish/#more-1973|title="Rediscovered" Wood &amp; The Triton Sawfish|publisher=Inhabitat|date=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relocation====
Another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned. In 2000, the World Commission on Dams estimated that dams had physically displaced 40-80 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/way-forward/world-commission-dams/world-commission-dams-framework-brief-introduction|title=Briefing of World Commission on Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|date=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Failure risks====
{{See also|Dam failure|List of hydroelectric power station failures}}

Because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water, a failure due to poor construction, natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure.

During Typhoon Nina in 1975 [[Banqiao Dam]] failed in Southern China when more than a year's worth of rain fell within 24 hours. The resulting flood resulted in the deaths of 26,000 people, and another 145,000 from epidemics. Millions were left homeless.

The creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as 1963 disaster at [[Vajont Dam]] in Italy, where almost 2,000 people died.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;References may be found in the list of [[Dam failure]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malpasset Dam]] failure in [[Fréjus]] on the [[French Riviera]] (Côte d'Azur), southern France, collapsed on December 2, 1959, killing 423 people in the resulting flood.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_french/malpasset/malpasset.htm retrieved 02sep2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller dams and [[micro hydro]] facilities create less risk, but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned. For example, the small earthen embankment [[Kelly Barnes Dam]] failed in 1977, twenty years after its power station was decommissioned; causing 39 deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://ga.water.usgs.gov/news/historical-toccoa/ Toccoa Flood] USGS Historical Site, retrieved 02sep2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison and interactions with other methods of power generation===
Hydroelectricity eliminates the [[flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion]], including pollutants such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitric oxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], dust, and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the [[coal]]. Hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of [[coal mining]] and the indirect health effects of coal emissions.

====Nuclear power====

Compared to [[nuclear power]], hydroelectricity construction requires altering large areas of the environment while a nuclear power station has a small footprint, and hydro-powerstation failures have caused tens of thousands of more deaths than any nuclear station failure.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The creation of [[Garrison Dam]], for example, required Native American land to create Lake Sakakawea, which has a shoreline of 1,320 miles, and caused the inhabitants to sell 94% of their arable land for $7.5 million in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Michael L. (1982). ''Dammed Indians: the Pick-Sloan Plan and the Missouri River Sioux, 1944–1980''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, nuclear power is relatively inflexible; although nuclear power can reduce its output reasonably quickly. Since the cost of nuclear power is dominated by its high infrastructure costs, the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production. Because of this, nuclear power is mostly used for [[baseload]]. By way of contrast, hydroelectricity can supply peak power at much lower cost. Hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for [[load following]]. Country examples were they are paired in a close to 50/50 share include [[Electricity sector in Switzerland|the electric grid in Switzerland]],  the [[Electricity sector in Sweden]] and to a lesser extent, [[Energy in Ukraine#Electricity|Ukraine]] and the [[Electricity sector in Finland]].

====Wind power====

[[Wind power]] goes through predictable [[Variable renewable energy|variation]] by season, but is [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] on a daily basis. Maximum wind generation has little relationship to peak daily electricity consumption, the wind may peak at night when power isn't needed or be still during the day when electrical demand is highest. Occasionally weather patterns can result in low wind for days or weeks at a time, a hydroelectric reservoir capable of storing weeks of output is useful to balance generation on the grid. Peak wind power can be offset by minimum hydropower and minimum wind can be offset with maximum hydropower. In this way the easily regulated character of hydroelectricity is used to compensate for the intermittent nature of wind power. Conversely, in some cases wind power can be used to spare water for later use in dry seasons.

In areas that do not have hydropower, [[pumped storage]] serves a similar role, but at a much higher cost and 20% lower efficiency. An example of this is [[Electricity sector in Norway|Norway's trading]] with [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and possibly [[Germany]] or the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sintef.no/en/latest-news/norway-is-europes-cheapest-battery/&lt;/ref&gt; Norway is 98% hydropower, while it's flatland neighbors are installing wind power.

==World hydroelectric capacity==

[[File:Top 5 Hydropower-Producing Countries.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Trends in the top five hydroelectricity-producing countries]]

{{See also|List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|Cost of electricity by source}}
{{See also|Category:Hydroelectricity by country}}

The ranking of hydro-electric capacity is either by actual annual energy production or by installed capacity power rating. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity.&lt;ref name="ren21.net"/&gt;
Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generated 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Paraguay]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Venezuela]] have a majority of the internal electric energy production from hydroelectric power. [[Paraguay]] produces 100% of its electricity from hydroelectric dams, and exports 90% of its production to Brazil and to Argentina. [[Norway]] produces 98–99% of its electricity from hydroelectric sources.&lt;ref name=norway/&gt;

A hydro-electric station rarely operates at its full power rating over a full year; the ratio between annual average power and installed capacity rating is the [[capacity factor]]. The installed capacity is the sum of all generator nameplate power ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2009/STAGING/local_assets/downloads/spreadsheets/statistical_review_full_report_workbook_2009.xls Consumption BP.com]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Group theory sidebar |Basics}}

In mathematics, an '''image''' is the [[subset]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]'s [[codomain]] which is the output of the function from a subset of its [[Domain of a function|domain]].

Evaluating a function at each element of a subset ''X'' of the domain, produces a set called the ''image of X under or through'' the function. The '''inverse image''' or '''preimage''' of a particular subset ''S'' of the [[codomain]] of a function is the set of all elements of the domain that map to the members of ''S''.

Image and inverse image may also be defined for general [[binary relation#Operations on binary relations|binary relations]], not just functions.

==Definition==
The word "image" is used in three related ways. In these definitions, ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' to the set ''Y''.

===Image of an element===
If ''x'' is a member of ''X'', then ''f''(''x'') = ''y'' (the [[value (mathematics)|value]] of ''f'' when applied to ''x'') is the image of ''x'' under ''f''. ''y'' is alternatively known as the output of ''f'' for argument ''x''.

===Image of a subset===
The image of a subset ''A'' ⊆ ''X'' under ''f'' is the subset ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ⊆ ''Y'' defined by (in [[set-builder notation]]):

:&lt;math&gt;f[A] = \{ \, y \in Y \, | \, y = f(x) \text{ for some } x \in A \, \}&lt;/math&gt;

When there is no risk of confusion, ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is  simply written as ''f''(''A''). This convention is a common one; the intended meaning must be inferred from the context.  This makes ''f''[.] a function whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is the [[power set]] of ''X'' (the set of all [[subset]]s of ''X''), and whose [[codomain]] is the power set of ''Y''. See [[#Notation|Notation]] below.

===Image of a function===
The image ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; of the entire [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' of ''f'' is called simply the image of ''f''.

===Generalization to binary relations===
If ''R'' is an arbitrary [[binary relation]] on ''X''[[cartesian product|×]]''Y'', the set { y∈''Y'' | ''xRy'' for some ''x''∈''X'' } is called the image, or the range, of ''R''. Dually, the set { ''x''∈''X'' | ''xRy'' for some y∈''Y'' } is called the domain of ''R''.

==Inverse image==
{{Redirect|Preimage|the cryptographic attack on hash functions|preimage attack}}
Let ''f'' be a function from ''X'' to ''Y''.  The '''preimage''' or inverse image of a set ''B'' ⊆ ''Y'' under ''f'' is the subset of ''X'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}[ B ] = \{ \, x \in X \, | \, f(x) \in B \}&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse image of a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]], denoted by ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{''y''}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or by   ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is also called the [[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]] over ''y'' or the [[level set]] of ''y''.  The set of all the fibers over the elements of ''Y'' is a family of sets indexed by ''Y''.

For example, for the function ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the inverse image of {4} would be {−2, 2}. Again, if there is no risk of confusion, we may denote ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''B''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; by ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''), and think of ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as a function from the power set of ''Y'' to the power set of ''X''. The notation ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt; should not be confused with that for [[inverse function]]. The notation coincides with the usual one, though, for bijections, in the sense that the inverse image of ''B'' under ''f'' is the image of ''B'' under ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==&lt;span id="Notation"&gt;Notation&lt;/span&gt; for image and inverse image==
The traditional notations used in the previous section can be confusing. An alternative&lt;ref&gt;Blyth 2005, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; is to give explicit names for the image and preimage as functions between powersets:

===Arrow notation===
* &lt;math&gt;f^\rightarrow:\mathcal{P}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(Y)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f^\rightarrow(A) = \{ f(a)\;|\; a \in A\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^\leftarrow:\mathcal{P}(Y)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f^\leftarrow(B) = \{ a \in X \;|\; f(a) \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;

===Star notation===
* &lt;math&gt;f_\star:\mathcal{P}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(Y)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;f^\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^\star:\mathcal{P}(Y)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;f^\leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;

===Other terminology===
* An alternative notation for ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; used in [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] is ''f''&amp;nbsp;"''A''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Set Theory for the Mathematician | author=Jean E. Rubin |authorlink= Jean E. Rubin |page=xix | year=1967 |publisher=Holden-Day |asin=B0006BQH7S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Randall Holmes: [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8d8/5cdd3eb2fd9406d13b5c04d55708068031ef.pdf Inhomogeneity of the urelements in the usual models of NFU], December 29, 2005, on: Semantic Scholar, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some texts refer to the image of ''f'' as the range of ''f'', but this usage should be avoided because the word "range" is also commonly used to mean the [[codomain]] of ''f''.

==Examples==
# ''f'': {1, 2, 3} → {''a, b, c, d''} defined by &lt;math&gt;
    f(x) = \left\{\begin{matrix}
      a, &amp; \mbox{if }x=1 \\
      a, &amp; \mbox{if }x=2 \\
      c, &amp; \mbox{if }x=3.
    \end{matrix}\right.
  &lt;/math&gt;{{paragraph break}} The ''image'' of the set {2, 3} under ''f'' is ''f''({2, 3}) = {''a, c''}.  The ''image'' of the function ''f'' is {''a, c''}. The ''preimage'' of ''a'' is ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({''a''}) = {1, 2}. The ''preimage'' of {''a, b''} is also {1, 2}.  The preimage of {''b'', ''d''} is the [[empty set]] {}.
# ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''' defined by ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{paragraph break}} The ''image'' of {−2, 3} under ''f'' is ''f''({−2, 3}) = {4, 9}, and the ''image'' of ''f'' is '''R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''. The ''preimage'' of {4, 9} under ''f'' is ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({4, 9}) = {−3, −2, 2, 3}. The preimage of set ''N'' = {''n'' ∈ '''R''' | ''n'' &lt; 0} under ''f'' is the empty set, because the negative numbers do not have square roots in the set of reals.
# ''f'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''' defined by ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{paragraph break}} The [[Fiber (mathematics)|''fibres'']] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({''a''}) are [[concentric circles]] about the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], the origin itself, and the [[empty set]], depending on whether ''a'' &gt; 0, ''a'' = 0, or ''a'' &lt; 0, respectively.
# If ''M'' is a [[manifold]] and ''π'': ''TM'' → ''M'' is the canonical [[projection (mathematics)|projection]] from the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' to ''M'', then the ''fibres'' of ''π'' are the [[tangent spaces]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') for ''x''∈''M''. This is also an example of a [[fiber bundle]].
# A quotient group is a homomorphic image.

==Consequences==

Given a function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', for all subsets ''A'', ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X'' and all subsets ''B'', ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''Y'' we have:

* ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;⊆ ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref name="kelley-1985"/&gt;

* ''f''(A)&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''B'' ⇔  ''A''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;    ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'')
* ''f''(''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''))&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;ref&gt;Equality holds if ''B'' is a subset of Im(''f'') or, in particular, if ''f'' is surjective. See Munkres, J.. Topology (2000), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''(''A''))&amp;nbsp;⊇&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;ref&gt;Equality holds if  ''f'' is injective. See Munkres, J.. Topology (2000), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⇒ ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊆ ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⇒ ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊆ ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) = (''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''))&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;
* (''f''&amp;nbsp;|&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'') = ''A'' ∩ ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'').

The results relating images and preimages to the ([[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean]]) algebra of [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] work for any collection of subsets, not just for pairs of subsets:
* &lt;math&gt;f\left(\bigcup_{s\in S}A_s\right) = \bigcup_{s\in S} f(A_s)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f\left(\bigcap_{s\in S}A_s\right) \subseteq \bigcap_{s\in S} f(A_s)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{s\in S}B_s\right) = \bigcup_{s\in S} f^{-1}(B_s)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(\bigcap_{s\in S}B_s\right) = \bigcap_{s\in S} f^{-1}(B_s)&lt;/math&gt;
(Here, ''S'' can be infinite, even [[uncountably infinite]].)

With respect to the algebra of subsets, by the above we see that the inverse image function is a [[lattice homomorphism]] while the image function is only a [[semilattice]] homomorphism (it does not always preserve intersections).

Boston: Harvard Business Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovationtournaments.com Innovation Tournaments]&lt;/ref&gt; who exclusively focus on innovation competitions. They argue, that while [[innovation]] is seen as a largely creative endeavor, it can also be rigorously managed by viewing and structuring the [[innovation process]] as a collection of “opportunities”. Profitable innovation comes not from increasing [[investment]]s in R&amp;D, but from systematically identifying more exceptional opportunities. Terwiesch and Ulrich show how to design and run innovation tournaments: pitting competing opportunities against one another, and then consistently filtering out the weakest ones until only those with the highest profit potential remain.

The aims and the design principles of the innovation competitions are noted in the literature as follows:
* Encourage [[Adidas]] users to participate in an [[open innovation]] process, to inspire their [[creativity]], and to increase the quality of the submissions.&lt;ref&gt;Piller, F.T. and Walcher, D. (2006) Toolkits for Idea Competitions: A Novel Method to Integrate Users in New Product Development. R&amp;D Management, Vol. 36, No. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;307–318.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Constraints are an invaluable tool for fostering creativity. Idea Crossing’s contestants bound by rules strive to strategize optimal solutions to meet a competition's goal.&lt;ref&gt;Lefford, N. and Rathi, A. (2007) Rules of the Game: Innovation, Competition, Constraint and Customization. Proceedings of MCPC 2007, The World Conference on Mass Customization and Personalization, October 10–17, 2007, Boston: MIT.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Generate innovations, process and product ideas for [[SAP Research]] and Development through an IT-supported ideas competition among the SAP UCC Community. The concept aims at providing an interface to SAP Human Resources processes in order to identify the most promising students for VCs.&lt;ref&gt;Ebner, W., Leimeister, M., Bretschneider, U. and Krcmar, H. (2008) Leveraging the Wisdom of Crowds: Designing an IT-Supported Ideas Competition for an ERP Software Company. Proceedings of Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HiCCS-41). Waikoloa, Big Island, HI, January 7–10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Siemens]] Corporate Technology held an idea competition to help bridge the innovation gap that exists between the different R&amp;D departments and the operational units. The company learnt that idea competitions can be a first step toward more comprehensive innovation processes.&lt;ref&gt;Schepers, J., Schnell, R. and Vroom, P. (1999) From Idea to Business—How Siemens Bridges the Innovation Gap. Research Technology Management, Vol. 42, No. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;26-.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation competitions are useful in generating radical ideas for the development of new products for the [[service industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Duverger, P. and Hassan, S. (2007) An Empirical Study to Identify New Sources of Radical Service Innovation Ideas Using the Toolkit for Idea Competition. Proceedings of MCPC 2007, The World Conference on Mass Customization and Personalization, October 10–17, 2007, Boston: MIT.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation competitions are sometimes organized by a [[Party (law)|third party]] (an intermediator), instead of the focal company or innovator community. Unfortunately, innovation intermediator studies happen also to be a scarce resource. Chesbrough&lt;ref&gt;Chesbrough, H.W. (2006) Open Business Models. How to Thrive in the New Innovation Landscape. Boston: Harvard Business School Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; calls innovation brokers 'innovation intermediaries'.

In September 2009, [[Netflix]] awarded 1 million US dollars to the winner of [[Netflix prize]]—the team who by 10% improved the accuracy of predictions about the extent that people enjoy a movie based on their past movie preferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netflixprize.com//community/viewtopic.php?id=1537 Grand Prize awarded to team BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos] Netflix Prize, Accessed Nov. 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On Nov. 16, 2010, [[General Electric]] will announce the winners of its multimillion-dollar challenge&lt;ref&gt;[http://challenge.ecomagination.com/ct/g.bix?c=ideas How it works] GE Ecomagination Challenge, Accessed Nov. 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; to find new, breakthrough ideas to create cleaner, more efficient and economically viable grid technologies, and to accelerate the adoption of [[smart grid]] technologies.

Since 2010, the [[IXL Innovation Olympics]] has provided a platform to source breakthrough ideas, for CEOs from Fortune 100 Companies, using teams from MBA programs across the globe.  As an example, [[IBM]] used this platform to source breakthrough ideas for increaesing accessibility to screens and devices for the aging population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibm.com/blogs/age-and-ability/2016/09/06/rethinking-how-technology-can-improve-the-quality-of-life-of-our-aging-population/] September 6, 2016, Nicola Palmarini.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9023">[[File:B.F. Skinner.jpg|thumb|Photo of B.F. Skinner, American psychologist credited for understanding of operant conditioning associated with instinctive drift.]]
'''Instinctive drift''' also known as instinctual drift is the tendency of an animal, of any species, to revert to unconscious and automatic behaviour that interferes with [[operant conditioning]] and the learned responses that come with it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=R. W.|last2=Curley|first2=M.|title=Instinctive drift in non-domesticated rodents|url=http://paperity.org/p/59817825/instinctive-drift-in-nondomesticated-rodents|journal=Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society |year=1976|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; B.F Skinner was an American psychologist who coined the term operant conditioning or instrumental conditioning, which is to learn by means of being granted either a reward or punisher for the action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It's through the association of the behaviour and consequence that follows that depicts if an animal will learn to practice the behaviour, or if the behaviour will become extinct.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The concept of instinctive drift originated by the two former students of B.F Skinner's, Keller and Marian Breland when they taught raccoons to deposit money into a bank slot. The raccoons were initially successful at this activity but over time began to dip the coins in and out and rub them together rather than drop them in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In nature raccoons instinctively dip their food into water several times and rub it in order to wash it. Therefore, the adoption of this behaviour with coins is instinctual drift, and interferes with their training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Instinctive behaviour is innate, it isn't [[learned]]. it's usually automatic and unplanned, a natural reaction which often is preferred by the animal over learned and unnatural actions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This topic is relevant and discussed when it comes to the nature and nurture controversy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many experimental studies have been conducted on this topic which proves its reliability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Natural behaviours are easier to learn and often easier expressed, even subliminally.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Origin of Instinctive Drift==

The term instinctive drift was coined by Keller and Marian Breland, former students of [[B.F Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] at the University of Minnesota (Marian in 1938, Keller in 1940).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; B.F. Skinner coined the term operant conditioning.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staddon|first1=J.E.|last2=Niv|first2=Y.|title=Operant conditioning|url=http://scholarpedia.org/article/Operant_conditioning|year=2008|journal=Scholarpedia |volume=3 |issue=9 |page=2318|accessdate=17 November 2017|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.2318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Breland's followed Skinners principles of control and decided to live off this principle through creation of "Animal Behaviour Enterprises.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They began the commercial training of animals instead of finishing their degrees.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They began their business on a farm, but as multiple contracts were being created with various companies, the Breland shows ended up spreading nationwide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was Keller and Marian Breland who discovered the meaning of and coined the term instinctive drift through their research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They were working with racoons and conducted an experiment which involved teaching raccoons to deposit money into a bank slot. The Brelands noticed that over time and as the reinforcement schedule was spaced out, the raccoons began to dip the coins in and out of the bank and rub them with their paws rather than depositing them. They concluded that this was an instinct that was interfering with the raccoons’ performance on the task.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In nature, [[raccoons]] dip their food in water several times in order to wash it. This is an instinct which was seemingly triggered by the similar action sequence involved in retrieving and depositing coins into a bank. This instinctual drift was successfully avoided when they instead taught the raccoons to place a basketball into a basket. Because of the size of the ball and the different body position involved in this action, the raccoons did not experience instinctual drift (they did not dip the balls in and out of the basket.)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mazur|first1=J.E.|title=Learning and behaviour: seventh edition|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=K9UvCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=instinctive+drift&amp;ots=J2rIrXvrG2&amp;sig=9GOA69UIw98KkkBh7TM7AjjsrZk#v=onepage&amp;q=instinctive%20drift&amp;f=false|year=2016 |publisher=Southern Connecticut State University|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar experiment was conducted on pigs. They were trained to insert wooden coins into a piggy bank.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=C.D|title=Classics in the history of psychology|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Breland/misbehavior.htm|publisher=York University |accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the pigs stopped depositing the coins and instead began to drop it in the dirt, push it down with their noses, drag it back out, and fling it into the air.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is a series of actions which are part of a behaviour known as  [[wikt:root#Verb 2|rooting]]. It is an instinctual pattern of behaviour which pigs use to dig for food and to communicate.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The pigs preferred rooting than performing their trained action (depositing the coin) and this is therefore an example of instinctual drift interfering with operant conditioning.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Nature vs. nurture==

The nature vs. nurture controversy is a major topic discussed in psychology and pertains to animal training as well. Both sides of the nature vs. nurture debate have valid points and this controversy is one of the most debated in [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bergeman|first1=C.S;|last2=Plomin|first2=R.|title=Nature and nurture|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/nature-and-nurture/B6BA941F56B11AD14B814A5C32704205|year=1991 |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=14 |pages=373–427|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common question asked today by many experts in various fields is if behaviour is due to life experiences or if it is predisposed in DNA.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Today, partial credit is given to both sides and in many cases nature and nurture are given equal weight. With animal training it is often questioned if the training and shaping is the cause of a behaviour exhibited by an animal (nurture), or if the behaviour is actually innate to the [[species]] (nature).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lehrman|first1=D.S.|title=A critique of Konrad Lorenz's theory of instinctive behaviour|year=1953 |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=337–63|pmid=13121237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instinctive drift centers around the nature of behaviour more so than learning being the sole cause of a behaviour. Species are obviously capable of learning behaviours, this is not denied in instinctive drift.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Instinctive drift says that animals often revert to innate (nature) behaviours that can interfere with conditioned responses (nurture).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Evolution and Instinctive Drift==

Instinctive drift can be discussed in association with [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite paper|title=Evolution by natural selection|last1=Darwin|first1=C.|last2=Wallace|first2=A. R.|year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution is commonly classified as change occurring over a period of time.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Instinctive drift says that animals will behave in accordance with evolutionary contingencies, as opposed to operant contingencies of their specific training.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Evolutionary roots of instinct exist.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cudmore|first1=B.|title=The evolutionary roots of instinct|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/49794/title/The-Evolutionary-Roots-of-Instinct/|year=2017 |work=The Scientist|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution of traits and behaviours occur over time and it is by means of evolution and natural selection that adaptive traits and behaviours are passed on to the next generation and maladaptive traits are weaned out. It is the adaptive traits of species over time that is exhibited in instinctive drift and that species revert to that interferes with [[operant conditioning]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Much knowledge on the topic of evolution and natural selection can be credited to [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Darwin developed and proposed the theory of evolution and it was through this knowledge that other subjects could be better understood, such as instinctive drift.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

In the theory of many-particle systems, '''Jacobi coordinates''' often are used to simplify the mathematical formulation.  These coordinates are particularly common in treating polyatomic [[molecule]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s,&lt;ref name= Zhang&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[celestial mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Belbruno&gt;

For example, see {{cite book |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics |author= Edward Belbruno |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dK-fl0KrOEIC&amp;pg=PA9 |page=9 |isbn=0-691-09480-2 |date=2004 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}

&lt;/ref&gt; An algorithm for generating the Jacobi coordinates for ''N'' bodies may be based upon [[binary trees]].&lt;ref name=Cabral&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In words, the algorithm is described as follows:&lt;ref name=Cabral/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be the masses of two bodies that are replaced by a new body of virtual mass ''M'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The position coordinates '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are replaced by their relative position  '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and by the vector to their center of mass '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; = (''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)/(''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; +  ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;). The node in the binary tree corresponding to the virtual body has ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; as its right child and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; as its left child. The order of children indicates the relative coordinate points from '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. Repeat the above step for ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 bodies, that is, the ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 original bodies plus the new virtual body. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the [[N-body problem|''N''-body problem]] the result is:&lt;ref name=Cornille&gt;{{cite book |title=Advanced electromagnetism and vacuum physics |author=Patrick Cornille |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8sSFTDkQ20C&amp;pg=PA102 |chapter=Partition of forces using Jacobi coordinates  |isbn=981-238-367-0 |date=2003 |publisher=World Scientific}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_j }= \frac{1}{m_{0j}} \sum_{k=1}^j m_k\boldsymbol {x_k} \ - \ \boldsymbol{x_{j+1}}\ , \quad (j = 1, 2, \dots, N-1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_N }= \frac{1}{m_{0N}} \sum_{k=1}^N m_k\boldsymbol {x_k} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;m_{0j} = \sum_{k=1}^j \ m_k \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The vector &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{r_N} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[center of mass]] of all the bodies:

The result one is left with is thus a system of ''N''-1 translationally invariant coordinates &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_1}, \dots, \boldsymbol{r_{N-1}}&lt;/math&gt; and a center of mass coordinate &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_N}&lt;/math&gt;, from iteratively reducing two-body systems within the many-body system.

'''Joseph L. Graves, Jr.''' (born 1955), is an American Scientist and the Associate Dean for Research and Professor of [[Biology|Biological Studies]] at the Joint School for Nanoscience and Nanoengineering which is jointly administered by [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University]] and [[UNC Greensboro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncat.edu/~univstud/faculty.html University Studies Faculty, North Carolina A &amp; T State University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116043939/http://www.ncat.edu/~univstud/faculty.html |date=2007-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His past research has included an examination of the [[evolution]] of life history and physiological performance in [[Drosophila]], a genus of small flies often called [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]]. His current work includes the genomics of adaptation, as well as the response of bacteria to metallic/metallic oxide nanoparticles.  A particular application of this research has been to the evolutionary theory of aging.&lt;ref name="biopage"&gt;[http://www.minority.unc.edu/institute/2002/spkrbios/drgraves.htm Graves profile] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]]'s [http://minority.unc.edu/institute/ Minority Health Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Using his background in evolutionary biology, he has also written two books that address myths and theories of race in American society. Graves has made appearances in six documentary films on these general topics. He has been a Principal Investigator on grants from the [[National Institute of Health]], [[National Science Foundation]] and the Arizona Disease Research Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolfmanproductions.com/graves.html Dr. Joseph L. Graves, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206120027/http://www.wolfmanproductions.com/graves.html |date=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Graves was born in 1955 and received his B.A. in [[biology]] from [[Oberlin College]] in 1977 and his PhD from [[Wayne State University]] in 1988. Before his appointment to North Carolina A &amp; T State University, he held positions at the [[University of California, Irvine]]; at the [[Arizona State University at the West campus|West campus of Arizona State University]], with a joint appointment in [[African American Studies]] at the main campus of [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]; and as University Core Director at [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]].

Childhood experiences shaped Graves' interest in race and racism: "My parents were poor. They didn’t know how to read. I had to teach myself how to read," he says. "The school system of my home was racially biased. When I was in kindergarten teachers wanted to declare me mentally retarded so that I could be placed in a special education curriculum. The regular curriculum had a [[tracking system]]," Graves continues. "For no apparent reason, all the black kids ended up in the lower track." But, by graduation day, years later, Graves had risen to be among the highest ranked students at his high school. He accepted an academic scholarship to attend Oberlin College and graduated from there with a A.B. in Biology in 1977.  His next two years were spent at the Institute for Tropical Disease at the University of Lowell (today called U. Mass. Lowell.)  And thus, this allowed him to earn a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship to begin his PhD work at the University of Michigan in 1979. He completed his PhD in Evolutionary, Environmental, and Systematic Biology at Wayne State University in 1988.  This work afforded him the prestigious President's Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of California, Irvine from 1988-1990. He joined the faculty at the University of California, Irvine in 1990.

==Career==

===Research===
{{rquote|left|Most Americans still believe that there is some biological legitimacy to our socially constructed racial categories. However, our modern scientific understanding of human genetic diversity flies in the face of all of our social stereotypes.|Joseph L. Graves, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graves |first=Joseph L |url=http://www.heartland.org/pdf/12721n.pdf |title=The Biological Case Against Race |work=American Outlook |date=January 1, 2002 |accessdate=November 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115040049/http://www.heartland.org/pdf/12721n.pdf |archivedate=November 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Working with Laurence D. Mueller, Graves found that [[population density]] is an important factor in determining both the immediate chances of survival and the course of [[natural selection]] for small organisms such as fruit flies.&lt;ref&gt;"Population density effects on longevity" ''Genetica'' Volume 91, Numbers 1-3 / February 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In "Chance, Development, and Aging", ''Human Biology'' December 2001, Graves wrote that the explanation of individual patterns of [[aging]] must take into account subtle mechanisms such as extensive chance variations in cell number and connections, in cell fates during differentiation, and in physiological patterns that arise during development. Graves has studied the tiny insects for more than a decade in pursuit of greater understanding of [[senescence]], the process of aging.

In addition to the study of aging, Graves is interested in the [[history of science|history]] and [[philosophy of science]] as it relates to the biology of race and racism in western society. He has received a fair amount of attention from the press for his writings on this topic, especially his strong statements about the socially constructed nature of race. According to his profile on the University of North Carolina Minority Health Project website, he believes: &lt;blockquote&gt;there are still significant academic and popular views of race that are mired in the biological determinism of the 19th century and the application of proper scientific method and philosophy, along with quantitative genetics reveals the underlying racist ideology of these programs.&lt;ref name="biopage"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
In addition to his research interests, Graves has also been an active participant in the struggle to protect and improve the teaching of science in the public schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minority.unc.edu/institute/2006/spkrbios/JosephGraves.cfm Joseph L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25858">The '''legal system of the [[United Arab Emirates]]''' is based on the [[Constitution of the United Arab Emirates|Constitution]] of the United Arab Emirates; this system is dual in nature as it has local and federal courts with a Supreme Court Based at Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalarbitrationreview.com/know-how/topics/73/jurisdictions/33/united-arab-emirates/&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Britain&lt;ref&gt;https://www.innertemple.org.uk/downloads/education/lectures/lecture_james_lee.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries where previous court judgments are regularly used as legal precedents, the UAE does not depend that much on precedents, although sometimes the judgments of higher courts can be applied by lower courts in similar cases.

Where legislative provisions do not cover a specific issue, the court will make a decision in accordance with Sharia law. Islamic jurisprudence is widely used in the construction and interpretation of the UAE law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hadefpartners.com/News/115/SHARIA-AS-A-SOURCE-OF-UAE-LAW|title=Sharia as a source of UAE law|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hadefpartners.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Prior to the Union in 1971, the Trucial States were known as a protectorate of the British Empire established through a number of treaties. During that period, most disputes were handled by the rulers of the emirates, heads of local tribes, and unofficial judges following [[customary law]]. The primary source of law was Islam along with the unwritten social conventions or "[[Urf]]". Sharia judges specialized in family disputes whereas customary law judges handled criminal assaults and personal disputes. In the inland Bedouin communities, disputes usually related to livestock and water resources. Disputes in coastal cities were normally about trade and commercial relations, particularly related to the pearl trade.

After the 1853 truce, disputes pertaining to pearl diving were handled directly by the British [[Persian Gulf Residency|political resident]] in the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Judicial System in The Trucial Coast|last=Al Falahi|first=Noora|publisher=Hamdan Bin Mohammed Heritage Centre|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UAE legal system in the constitution==

The United Arab Emirates’ [[Constitution of the United Arab Emirates|Constitution]], which came into effect on 2 December 1971, dedicates all its fifth Section for the Union legal system. Article 94 of the Constitution stipulates that “justice is the basis of authority”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_Arab_Emirates_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of UAE laws ==
The United Arab Emirates is essentially a civil law jurisdiction that depends in the first place on Roman, French, Egyptian laws . However, the main source of the Emirati law is the [[Sharia|Sharia law]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; International law is another source of Emirati law, in compliance with the UAE obligations signed in international conventions.

== Courts ==

===The Supreme Court===

Being the highest judicial instance in the UAE does not mean that it applies to the seven Emirates, Dubai and Ras Al Khayma have their own local judicial system. Article 96 of the UAE Constitution reads as follows “The Supreme Court of the Union shall consist of a President and a number of Judges, not exceeding five in all, who shall be appointed by decree, issued by the President of the Union after approval by the Supreme Council ”.

The constitution also divides courts in the country into two types, federal courts and local courts. The president and the members of the Supreme Court can by no means be removed from their offices, except in the following cases: Death, resignation, completion of term or secondment, retirement, permanent disability that prevent a judge from undertaking their duties, disciplinary discharge and finally “appointment to other offices, with their agreement”. Any court has it jurisdiction, the judgments of the Emirati Supreme Court cover matters like Miscellaneous disputes raising between the Member Emirates, law constitutionality, constitution interpretation, interrogation of senior officials of the Union like Ministers, crimes threatening affecting the interests of the Union. Article 101 of the Emirati Constitution stipulates that “The judgements of the Supreme Court of the Union shall be final and binding upon all.”

The first President of the Union Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates is H.E Judge Dr. Abdul Wahab Abdul (incumbent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejustice.gov.ae/portal/page/portal/eJustice%20MOJ%20Portal/SupremeCourt/Home|website=Union Supreme Court|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Courts===

As their names suggests, Federal Courts are competent to consider all cases arising within the UAE territory, like disputes, domiciliary, transactions, etc. "Furthermore, UAE courts have a kind of “emergency jurisdiction,” whereby a UAE court can determine preliminary applications for attachment of a defendant’s assets as well as urgent applications, even where the court would otherwise lack jurisdiction" . Cases are commenced in Federal Courts when the complaint is filed with the Reconciliation and Settlement Committee. “The relevant reconciliation committee will attempt reconciliation, and refer complaints to the court only after resolution efforts have failed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.attorneys.ae/news/uae-courts/|title=How the Federal and local court systems fit together, UAE Courts|newspaper=UAE Attorneys|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local Courts===

Local courts (First Instance Court) in the UAE basically consider “cases, authentications and all urgent matters related to disputes among the people as well as the safeguard of their rights, security and safety. It also undertakes forcible judicial execution for execution deed stipulated by law, as well as executions by deputation or reference”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubaicourts.gov.ae/portal/page?_pageid=292,447242&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=First Instance Court|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dubaicourts.gov.ae|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharia Courts

Sharia courts focus on civil disputes in which the parties are Muslims. They depend on the juristic provisions provided for in the Quran the Hadith to render decisions. “The Sharia court may, at the federal level only (which, as mentioned earlier, excludes Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah), also hear appeals of certain criminal cases including rape, robbery, driving under the influence of alcohol and related crimes, which were originally tried in lower criminal courts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dubai.usconsulate.gov/emergency_uae_court.html|title=The UAE Court System|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Dubai, UAE - Consulate General of the United States|access-date=2016-11-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022020506/http://dubai.usconsulate.gov/emergency_uae_court.html|archivedate=2015-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil Courts

The jurisdiction of civil courts is generic as they can consider urgent cases and petitions of all types, including petitions of attachments, orders of payment and complaints. A civil Court also "deals with financial and corporeal rights and legal positions meant to protect by virtue of it, it does not includes commercial, realty, labor, personal status or endowment or inheritance cases".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubaicourts.gov.ae/portal/page?_pageid=292,451192&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Civil Court|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dubaicourts.gov.ae|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common Law Courts ===

==== Dubai International Financial Center Courts (DIFC) ====
{{see also|DIFC Courts}}

The DIFC Courts are an independent English language [[common law]] judiciary, with jurisdiction governing civil and commercial disputes nationally, regionally and worldwide. The Courts began operations in 2006.

Originally, the jurisdiction of the DIFC Courts was limited to the geographical area of the [[Dubai International Financial Centre|DIFC]]. On October 2011, the signing of Dubai Law No 16.&lt;sup&gt;[[DIFC Courts|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; allowed the DIFC Courts to hear any local or international cases and to resolve commercial disputes with the consent of all parties.

==== Abu Dhabi Global Market Courts (ADGM) ====
Established in accordance with Abu Dhabi Law No (4) of 2013, [[Abu Dhabi Global Market|ADGM]] Courts are broadly modelled on the English judicial system. The common law of England, including the principles and rules of [[Equity (law)|Equity]], apply and form part of the law of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adgm.complinet.com/net_file_store/new_rulebooks/a/p/Application_of_English_Law_Regulations_2015.pdf|title=Application of English Law Regulations 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ADGM|access-date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulations for ADGM Courts were also drawn from Scots and Australian Federal law and have been tailored specifically to meet the requirements of ADGM Courts. The direct application of [[English law]] makes ADGM the first jurisdiction in the Middle East to adopt a similar approach to that of Singapore and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adgm.com/doing-business/adgm-courts/adgm-legal-framework/adgm-courts-legal-framework/|title=ADGM {{!}} ADGM Courts Legal Framework|website=www.adgm.com|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither [[Dubai International Financial Centre|DIFC]] nor [[Abu Dhabi Global Market|ADGM]] courts have jurisdiction in criminal matters.

== Dubai Court System &amp; Ras Al Khaimah Court System ==
[[Dubai]] and [[Ras al-Khaimah|Ras Al Khaimah]] have two independent legal systems. For instance, Dubai’s court system three stages: The Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Cassation. Generally speaking, Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah courts consider local disputes concerning property and domestic disputes. However, it can also enforce foreign judgments, arbitration awards, and awards from other tribunals such as the dispute resolution bodies within the [[List of Free Trade Zones in Dubai|Free Zones]] &amp; Special Economic Zones. The legal systems of the two emirates are different from one another at several levels, but there is at least one important similarity which that of being independent from the federal system, and from the authority of the federal Supreme Court [http://www.attorneys.ae/news/uae-courts/]

== The Dubai Rental Disputes Center (RDC) ==
Established pursuant to Local Decree No.26 of 2013, the RDC has almost exclusive jurisdiction to settle disputes arising between landlords and tenants in Dubai, as per Dubai Law No.26 of 2007 Regulating Relationship between Landlords and Tenants in the Emirate of Dubai.

==Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)==
There are various [[Alternative dispute resolution|Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)]] mechanisms available for individuals and business in the UAE.

=== Arbitration ===
[[Arbitration]] has long been recognized as a dispute resolution mechanism in the region, and one that has been quoted in Islamic religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tamimi.com/en/magazine/law-update/section-7/august-september-1/finding-your-path-arbitration-sharia-and-the-modern-middle-east.html|title=Finding your path: Arbitration, Sharia, and the Modern Middle East - Al Tamimi &amp; Company|last=Company|first=Al Tamimi &amp;|website=www.tamimi.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been numerous initiatives in the UAE to build up a strong presence in international commercial arbitration, including the codification of modern arbitration rules in federal and other laws.

==== Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC) ====
First created in 1994 as the "Centre for Commercial Conciliation and Arbitration", the current DIAC is non-profit institution located in [[Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry|the Dubai Chamber of Commerce]] &amp; Industry (DCCI).

==== The DIFC/LCIA Arbitration Centre ====
A joint venture between the [[Dubai International Financial Centre]] (DIFC) and the [[London Court of International Arbitration]] (LCIA). The arbitration rules for the Center are closely modeled on the LCIA’s own rules with some modifications.

==== The International Islamic Centre for Reconciliation and Arbitration (IICRA) ====
IICRA is an international, independent, non-profit organization supporting the Islamic finance industry. The center settles all financial and commercial disputes that arise between financial or business institutions that choose to apply the provisions of Islamic law, Sharia principles, in resolving disputes that arise between these institutions and their clients or between them and third parties through reconciliation or arbitration.

=== Mediation ===

==== Employment disputes ====
Under the UAE Federal Labor Law, all unresolved employment disputes must be lodged first at the Ministry of Labour office where a settlement is negotiated between employers and workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mol.gov.ae/newmolgateway/english/newindex.aspx|title=Ministry of Labour|website=www.mol.gov.ae|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the negotiations fail, either party may take up the matter at court. Since there are no trade unions in the UAE, collective disputes are handled by a special committee composed of the Minister of Labour, a Supreme Court Judge, and one expert. In Dubai, individuals can also refer to a similar service provided by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs as a first step before going to court. In 2015, a new department dedicated to resolving disputes between domestic helpers and sponsors has opened at the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) branch in Al Aweer. The department, a sub-branch of the Follow up on Illegals and Foreigners Sector, handles complaints from domestic helpers in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/crime/new-department-to-resolve-domestic-helpers-disputes-1.1538784|title=New department to resolve domestic helpers’ disputes|last=Bedirian|first=Razmig|date=2015-06-22|work=|newspaper=GulfNews|access-date=2016-11-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Dubai, the General Department of Human Rights at Dubai Police receives individual and collective complaints filed by workers against their employers. Complaints would be related to living conditions, wages, and security and safety of labour accommodations and this service is accessible online.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dubaipolice.gov.ae/dp/jsps/content/flat_content.do?contentCode=105947&lt;/ref&gt; 

As to civil servants in Dubai, employment complaints can be filed at the office of the Ruler of Dubai, which will attempt to find an agreement between the two parties. If it fails, it will issue the employee a letter addressed to the Dubai courts regarding the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/courts/navigating-labour-disputes-in-the-uae|title=Navigating labour disputes in the UAE {{!}} The National|website=www.thenational.ae|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Crown Prince of Dubai has approved the establishment of the Dubai government staff central grievances committee. Members of the committee include a representative from the General Secretariat of the Executive Council of the Emirate of Dubai, the higher legislation committee and the department of human resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/dubai-government-grievances-committee-established|title=Dubai government grievances committee established {{!}} The National|website=www.thenational.ae|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== The Dubai Courts Centre for Amicable Dispute Resolution ====
Disputes that fall under the jurisdiction of the Centre are not registered at the courts unless they are submitted first and a referral is issued. Claims are handled by experienced mediators under the supervision of a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubaicourts.gov.ae/jimage/Info_services/Eng/A8%20eng.pdf|title=Dubai Courts Centre for Amicable Dispute Resolution|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a settlement is reached, the legally enforceable agreement will be signed by the parties and attested by a judge.

==== The Family Guidance Department ====
The Family Guidance Department forms an essential part of the family court. All divorce applications are handled first through the department where experienced mediators work to resolve the issues between couples and family members.

==== The Commercial Compliance and Consumer Protection (CCCP) ====
The Commercial Compliance and Consumer Protection Sector in Dubai Economy aims at raising the awareness and by commercial commitment, providing a safe and encouraging economic environment for businesses and investors, and increasing the awareness and trust of the consumer in the Emirate of Dubai. The organizational units in the Commercial Compliance and Consumer Protection Sector work to provide services to the consumers, businesses and the intellectual property owners. The organizational units also organize the practice of economic activity in the Emirate through inspection visits to the markets and raise the awareness of consumers and businesses through workshops and different awareness programs.

The Consumer Protection Department is responsible for protecting the rights of the consumers and educating them about their rights and responsibilities by providing consumer complaints services, organizing workshops and awareness programs aiming at enabling consumers to comply with the consumer laws and to follow the proper instructions that may preserve and guarantee the rights of the consumer and the business.
Consumer Complaints Department:
The Consumer Complaints Department receives complaints, inquiries and remarks of the consumers against the commercial establishments in the Emirate of Dubai. Complaints received by the staff of Dubai Economy, and considered in accordance with the consumer protection law, and the procedures in force at Department of Economic Development.

==== Dubai Chamber of Commerce ====
Mediation is one of the legal services provided by the Chamber. The value of mediation cases which were settled by the chamber during 2015 reached Dh18.3 million ($4.9 millions). The first mediation smart app in the Middle East was announced in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albayan.ae/economy/local-market/2015-11-04-1.2496567|title=تطبيق الوساطة الذكية الأول من نوعه في العالم|date=2015-11-04|website=البيان|language=ar-AR|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mediation at DIFC Courts ====
The Small Claims Tribunal (SCT) of the DIFC Courts, features a formal session of mediation as part of its procedure. Approximately 90% of applications before the SCT settle at the “consultation” phase which is a mandatory court–guided mediation session. Only if the parties are unable to reach a settlement will a judge of the DIFC Courts go on to hold a hearing and deliver a Court judgment. SCT proceedings are confidential and parties are not normally legally represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globallawsummit.com/the-role-of-mediation-in-the-difc-courts/|title=The Role of Mediation in the DIFC Courts {{!}}  Global Law Summit|website=globallawsummit.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial Studies and legal profession==

Since early years following its independence, the UAE has tried to build its judicial framework. To achieve this goal, the UAE has worked on several levels. Training people who would be judges, lawyers, clerks and others was one very important level.

=== The Institute of Training and Judicial Studies (ITJS) ===
The Institute of Training and Judicial Studies (ITJS) based in Abu Dhabi was established in December 14, 1992. The Cabinet issued Resolution N 14 of 1992 that officially establishes this institute. In 2004, a federal law confirmed the federal status of the institute.

Institute of Training and Judicial Studies (ITJS) undertakes several missions:
* Preparation of and qualification of Sharia and Law Schools to hold
* Organization of courses for judiciary members
* Organization of specialized courses for people like judicial aides and lawyers
* Scientific research
* Training personnel of governmental bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itjs.gov.ae/web/en/home/index.aspx?PriMenuID=2&amp;mnu=Pri |title=Welcome to the Institute of Training and Judicial Studies |website=www.itjs.gov.ae |access-date=2016-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828043018/http://www.itjs.gov.ae/web/en/home/index.aspx?PriMenuID=2&amp;mnu=Pri |archivedate=2016-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dubai Judicial Institute ===
Dubai Judicial Institute is a public institute established in 1996 by virtue of law No 1 of 1996, amended by law No 27 of 2009. This institute undertakes it’s the missions under the supervision the Cabinet of the Ruler of Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dji.gov.ae/en/pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abu Dhabi Judicial Academy ===
Abu Dhabi Judicial Academy was established under Decision No (16) of 2007 issued by His Highness Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Chairman of the Judicial Department, the Academy is an institution of higher education and specialized training that trains the Judicial Authority members on all branches of law and judicial majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adjd.gov.ae/portal/site/adjd/ar.Judicial.Academy/|title=Abu Dhabi Judicial Department  &gt; Abu Dhabi Judicial Academy|website=www.adjd.gov.ae|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Academy of Law (DIFC) ===
The DIFC Dispute Resolution Authority Academy (Academy of Law) was established in 2015 as an independent entity to provide quality services to the UAE legal community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.draacademy.ae/|title=Academy of Law|last=|first=|date=|website=www.draacademy.ae|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its core functions include training and regulating lawyers, publishing, hosting events for the legal community, and providing free legal advice for people in need. The academy offers comprehensive training to UAE legal professionals from all backgrounds and levels, from experienced English language Common Law practitioners through to newly qualified lawyers and those currently operating in the Arabic speaking civil system. The training faculty includes senior practicing barristers from Dubai and London with extensive experience of training advocates in England and other jurisdictions.

=== The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) ===
Established in 2005, the UAE Branch of [[Chartered Institute of Arbitrators|CIArb]] is part of the network of CIArb branches across the world. It offers arbitration related training, education (both in Arabic and English), as well as networking events for legal professionals and arbitrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciarb.org/branches/middle-east-and-indian-subcontinent/united-arab-emirates/about-us|title=About the Branch|website=www.ciarb.org|access-date=2016-06-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424190426/http://www.ciarb.org/branches/middle-east-and-indian-subcontinent/united-arab-emirates/about-us|archivedate=2016-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maktoum Bin Mohammed Initiatives for Legal Excellence ===
The Initiatives aim at enhancing the capacities of individuals engaged in the judicial field, and motivating pioneering in legal work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maktouminitiative.ae/Pages/About.aspx|title=About|website=www.maktouminitiative.ae|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project consists of a number of programs including the moot court competition, legal scientific research competition, legal scholarships program, program for legal and judicial conferences, and the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Courts Academy.

(Alonzo Rodriguez, 16th century, Museo Regionale di [[Messina]]).]]
The '''kiss of peace''' is an ancient traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] [[greeting]], sometimes also called the "holy kiss", "brother kiss" (among men), or "sister kiss" (among women). Such greetings signify a wish and blessing that [[peace]] be with the recipient, and besides their spontaneous uses they have certain [[ritualized]] or formalized uses long established in [[liturgy]]. Many denominations use other forms of greeting (besides literal [[kiss]]es) to serve equivalent purposes; they include [[handshake]]s, [[gesture]]s, and [[hug]]s, any of which may be called a '''sign of peace'''. 

==Sources==
It was the widespread custom in the ancient western [[Mediterranean]] for men to greet each other with a [[kiss]].&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, Smith's Bible Dictionary, [http://biblehub.com/topical/k/kiss.htm Kiss], UK, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; That was also the custom in ancient [[Judea]] and practiced also by Christians.

However, the [[New Testament]]'s references to a [[Sacred|holy]] kiss ({{lang-gr|εν αγιω φιληματι}}, ''en philemati hagio'') and kiss of [[love]] (''en philemati [[agapē]]s'') transformed the character of the act beyond a greeting. Such a kiss is mentioned five times in the concluding section of letters in the New Testament:

* [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] {{bibleverse-nb||Romans|16:16|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν φιλήματι ἁγίῳ}}).
* [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|16:20|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν φιλήματι ἁγίῳ}}).
* [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2 Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb|2|Corinthians|13:12|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν ἁγίῳ φιλήματι}}).
* [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|I Thessalonians]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Thessalonians|5:26|NIV}} — "Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς πάντας ἐν φιλήματι ἁγίῳ}}).
* [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Peter|5:14|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a kiss of love" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν φιλήματι ἀγάπης}}).

It has been noted that these mentions of the holy kiss come at the end of these epistles. Since these epistles were addressed to Christian communities they would most probably have been read in the context of their communal worship. If the assemblies for worship already concluded in a celebration of the [[Eucharist]] the holy kiss would already have occurred in the position it would later occupy in most ancient Christian liturgical tradition (with the exception of the Roman Rite), namely after the proclamation of the Word and at the beginning of the celebration of the Eucharist.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The writings of the early church fathers speak of the holy kiss, which they call "a sign of peace", which was already part of the [[Eucharist]]ic [[liturgy]], occurring after the [[Lord's Prayer]] in the [[Roman Rite]] and the rites directly derived from it. [[St. Augustine]], for example, speaks of it in one of his Easter Sermons: {{Quotation|Then, after the consecration of the Holy Sacrifice of God, because He wished us also to be His sacrifice, a fact which was made clear when the Holy Sacrifice was first instituted, and because that Sacrifice is a sign of what we are,  behold,  when the Sacrifice is finished, we say the Lord's Prayer which  you have received and recited. After this, the 'Peace be with you’ is said, and the Christians embrace one another with the holy kiss. This is a sign of peace; as the lips indicate, let  peace be made in your conscience, that is, when your lips  draw near to those of your brother, do not let your heart  withdraw from his. Hence, these are great and powerful sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;SERMON 227, ''The Fathers of the Church'',(1959), Roy Joseph Deferrari, Genera editor, ''Sermons on the Liturgical Seasons'', vol. 38, p. 197. [https://archive.org/details/fathersofthechur009512mbp] See also: Sermon 227 in ''The Works of Saint Augustine: A New Translation for the 21st Century'', (1993), Vol. 6, part, 3, p. 255. {{ISBN|1-56548-050-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Augustine's Sermon 227 is just one of several early Christian primary sources, both textual and iconographic (i.e., in works of art) providing clear evidence that the "kiss of peace" as practiced in the Christian liturgy was customarily exchanged for the first several centuries, not mouth to cheek, but mouth to mouth (note that men were separated from women during the liturgy) for, as the primary sources also show, this is how early Christians believed Christ and his followers exchanged their own kiss. For example, In his ''Paschale carmen'' (ca. 425-50), Latin priest-poet Sedulius condemns Judas and his betrayal of Christ with a kiss thus, "And leading that sacrilegious mob with its menacing swords and spikes, you press your mouth against his, and infuse your poison into his honey?"&lt;ref&gt;For a documented discussion of the mouth-to-mouth early Christian kiss of peace, see Franco Mormando, "Just as your lips approach the lips of yours brothers: Judas Iscariot and the Kiss of Betrayal," in ''Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' ed. F. Mormando (Chestnut Hill, MA: McMullen Museum of Boston College, 1999), pp.179-190.&lt;/ref&gt; The '''kiss of peace''' was known in Greek from an early date as ''eirḗnē'' ({{lang|grc|εἰρήνη}}) ("peace", which became ''pax'' in Latin and peace in English).&lt;ref name=CathEncl&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] - [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08663a.htm Kiss]&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the peace greeting is probably from the common Hebrew greeting [[shalom]]; and the greeting "Peace be with you" is similarly a translation of the Hebrew [[shalom aleichem]]. In the [[Gospels]], both greetings were used by [[Jesus]] - e.g. {{bibleverse||Luke|24:36|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||John|20:21|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|20:26|NIV}}. The Latin term translated as "sign of peace" is simply ''pax'' ("peace"), not ''signum pacis'' ("sign of peace") nor ''osculum pacis'' ("kiss of peace"). So the invitation by the deacon, or in his absence by the priest, "Let us offer each other the sign of peace", is in Latin: ''Offerte vobis pacem'' ("Offer each other peace" or "Offer each other the peace").

From an early date, to guard against any abuse of this form of salutation, women and men were required to sit separately, and the kiss of peace was given only by women to women and by men to men.&lt;ref name=CathEncl /&gt;

==In the Church==
The practice remains a part of the worship in traditional churches, including the Episcopal Church,&lt;ref&gt;Book of Common Prayer, 1979; &lt;/ref&gt;[[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox churches]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox churches]]; some liturgical mainline [[Christian denominations|Protestant denominations]]; and [[Spiritual Christian]], where it is often called the '''kiss of peace''', '''sign of peace''', '''Holy kiss''' or simply '''peace''' or '''pax''';  It is practiced as a part of worship in many Anabaptist heritage groups including [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], and [[Apostolic Christian]].

==Contemporary practices==

=== Catholic Church ===
In the [[Catholic Church]], the term now used is not "the kiss of peace", but "the sign of peace" or "the rite of peace". The ''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'' states: "There follows the Rite of Peace, by which the Church entreats peace and unity for herself and for the whole human family, and the faithful express to each other their ecclesial communion and mutual charity before communicating in the Sacrament."&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 82&lt;/ref&gt; The priest says or sings: "The peace of the Lord be with you always", to which the people respond: "And with your spirit." Then, as stated in the Roman Missal, "if appropriate, the Deacon, or the Priest, adds: 'Let us offer each other the sign of peace.'"&lt;ref name=RM&gt;Roman Missal, Order of Mass, 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Rite]], it is placed after the [[Pater Noster]] and before the [[Fractio panis (liturgy)|Fractio Panis]]. Even within the Catholic Church, there are [[Latin liturgical rites|liturgical rites]] (the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and the [[Mozarabic Rite]]) in which it is placed after the Liturgy of the Word, before the gifts for consecration are put on the altar. The latter placing is influenced by the recommendation in {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:23–24}} about seeking reconciliation with another before completing an offering at the altar. It was a practice in Rome itself at the time of [[Justin Martyr]] in the middle of the 2nd century. In the 3rd century the present placing was chosen not only in Rome but also in other parts of the West such as [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], where [[Saint Augustine]] understood it as related to the petition, "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us", in the Lord's Prayer and to the link between being in communion with the body of Christ understood as the Church and receiving communion with the body of Christ in the Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6e6LZrH1WXgC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=Irwin+%22sign+of+peace%22+Augustine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0kklVPP9LsiV7AbZwIGIAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Irwin%20%22sign%20of%20peace%22%20Augustine&amp;f=false Kevin W. Irwin, ''Responses to 101 Questions on the Mass'' (Paulist Press 1999)] {{ISBN|978-0-80913888-3}}, pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Tridentine Mass]] form of the Roman Rite, the sign of peace is given at [[Solemn Mass]]es alone and is exchanged only among the clergy (unless emperors, kings or princes were present, in which case they, too, received the greeting. If several members of a royal family were present, at least the sovereign received the greeting). It is given by extending both arms in a slight embrace with the words "Pax tecum" (Peace be with you), first by the priest celebrant to the [[deacon]], who in turn gives it to the [[subdeacon]], who gives the sign to any other clergy present in [[choir dress]].

In the Roman-Rite revised in 1969, the sign of peace is used at most [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] but is not obligatory. It is exchanged between all present in no prescribed order, except that "the Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or minister".&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; The manner prescribed is as follows: "It is appropriate that each one give the sign of peace only to those who are nearest and in a sober manner. The Priest may give the sign of peace to the ministers but always remains within the sanctuary, so as not to disturb the celebration. He does likewise if for a just reason he wishes to extend the sign of peace to some few of the faithful."&lt;ref name=VD&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html Redemptionis Sacramentum], 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are considered abuses by the [[Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship|Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments]]:&lt;ref name=XD&gt;[https://zenit.org/articles/text-of-vatican-document-on-sign-of-peace-at-mass/ Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments. ''The Ritual Expression of the Gift of Peace at Mass''], 6c&lt;/ref&gt;
*introducing a "song of peace" to accompany the rite;
*the faithful moving from their places to exchange the sign of peace;
*the priest leaving the altar to give the sign of peace to some of the faithful;
*expressing other sentiments, e.g. expressing congratulations, best wishes or condolences among those present at a [[wedding]], [[funeral]] or other ceremony.

The gesture by which the sign of peace is exchanged is to be determined by the local [[episcopal conference]]. In some countries, such as the [[United States]], the conference has laid down no rules, and the everyday handshake is generally used, while in other countries, such as [[India]] and [[Thailand]], a bow is prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=S31TA-yPDGwC&amp;pg=PT85&amp;dq=%22sign+of+peace%22+handshake+bow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SWglVKyKDoHN7QbhxoHABA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sign%20of%20peace%22%20handshake%20bow&amp;f=false Peter J. Elliott, ''Liturgical Question Box'' (Ignatius Press 1998)] {{ISBN|978-0-89870677-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 letter of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments recommended that conferences choose gestures more appropriate than "familiar and profane gestures of greeting".&lt;ref name=VD/&gt;

=== Eastern Orthodox Church ===

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]'s Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the exchange of the peace occurs at the midpoint of the service, when the scripture readings have been completed and the Eucharistic prayers are yet to come. The priest announces, "Let us love one another that with one accord we may confess--" and the people conclude the sentence, "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Trinity, one in essence and undivided." At that point the Kiss of Peace is exchanged by clergy at the altar, and in some churches among the laity as well (the custom is being reintroduced, but is not universal). Immediately after the peace, the deacon cries "The doors! The doors!"; in ancient times, the catechumens and other non-members of the church would depart at this point, and the doors would be shut behind them. At that, worshippers then recite the Nicene Creed. In the Eastern Orthodox Liturgy, the Kiss of Peace is preparation for the Creed: "Let us love one another that we may confess...the Trinity."

In the early centuries the kiss of peace was exchanged between the clergy: clergy kissing the bishop, lay men kissing laymen, and women kissing the women, according to the Apostolic Constitutions.  Today the kiss of love is exchanged between concelebrating priests.  Such has been the case for centuries. In a few Orthodox dioceses in the world in the last few decades, the kiss of peace between laymen has attempted to be reinstituted, usually as a handshake, hugging or cheek kissing.

Another example of an exchange of the peace is when, during the Divine Liturgy, the Priest declares to the people "Peace be with all", and their reply: "And with your Spirit". More examples of this practice may be found within Eastern Orthodoxy, but these are the most prominent examples.

=== Anglicanism ===
In the Anglican church it is common practice at more formal services for the congregation to be invited to "offer one another a sign of peace". However, this is usually a handshake although married couples may kiss one another instead.

=== Protestantism ===
Different [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] churches have readopted the holy kiss either metaphorically (in that members extend a pure, warm welcome that is referred to as a ''holy kiss'') or literally (in that members kiss one another). This practice is particularly important among many [[Anabaptist]] sects.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In [[mathematics]], in particular in [[category theory]], the '''lifting property''' is a property of a pair of morphisms in a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. It is used in [[homotopy theory]] within [[algebraic topology]] to define properties of morphisms starting from an explicitly given class of morphisms. It appears in a prominent way in the theory of [[model categories]], an axiomatic framework for [[homotopy theory]] introduced by [[Daniel Quillen]]. It is also used in the definition of a [[factorization system]], and of a [[weak factorization system]], notions related to but less restrictive then the notion of a model category. Several elementary notions may also be expressed using the lifting property starting from a list of (counter)examples.

==Formal definition==
A morphism ''i'' in a category has the ''left lifting property'' with respect to a morphism ''p'', and ''p'' also has the ''right lifting property'' with respect to ''i'', sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;i\perp p&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;i\downarrow p&lt;/math&gt;, iff the following implication holds for each morphism ''f'' and ''g'' in the category:
* if the outer square of the following diagram commutes, then there exists ''h'' completing the diagram, i.e. for each &lt;math&gt;f:A\to X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:B\to Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p\circ f = g \circ i&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;h:B\to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h\circ i = f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\circ h = g&lt;/math&gt;.

::[[File:Model category lifting.png]]

This is sometimes also known as the morphism ''i'' being ''orthogonal to'' the morphism ''p''; however, this can also refer to
the stronger property that whenever ''f'' and ''g'' are as above, the diagonal morphism ''h'' exists and is also required to be unique.

For a class ''C'' of morphisms in a category, its ''left orthogonal'' &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp \ell}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C^\perp&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the lifting property, respectively its ''right orthogonal'' &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp r}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;{}^\perp C&lt;/math&gt;, is the class of all morphisms which have the left, respectively right, lifting property with respect to each morphism in the class C. In notation,

: &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp\ell}:=\{ i \mid \forall p\in C, i\perp p\} \text{ and } C^{\perp r} := \{ p \mid \forall i\in C, i\perp p\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the orthogonal of a class ''C'' is a simple way to define a class of morphisms excluding non-isomorphisms from ''C'', in a way which is useful in a [[diagram chasing]] computation.

Thus, in the category Sets of sets the right orthogonal &lt;math&gt;\{ \emptyset \longrightarrow \{*\} \}^{\perp r}&lt;/math&gt; of the simplest non-surjection &lt;math&gt;\emptyset\longrightarrow \{*\}&lt;/math&gt;, is the class of surjections. The left and right orthogonals of &lt;math&gt;\{x_1,x_2\}\longrightarrow \{*\}&lt;/math&gt;, the simplest non-injection, are both precisely the class of injections, &lt;math&gt;\{\{x_1,x_2\}\longrightarrow \{*\}\}^{\perp\ell} = \{\{x_1,x_2\}\longrightarrow \{*\}\}^{\perp r} = \{ f \mid f \text{ is an injection } \}&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp\ell r} \supset C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp r\ell} \supset C&lt;/math&gt;. The class &lt;math&gt; C^{\perp\ell}&lt;/math&gt; is always closed under retracts, pullbacks, (small) products (whenever they exist in the category) and composition of morphisms, and contains all isomorphisms of C. Meanwhile, &lt;math&gt; C^{\perp r}&lt;/math&gt; is closed under retracts, pushouts, (small) coproducts and 
transfinite composition (filtered colimits) of morphisms (whenever they exist in the category), and also contains all isomorphisms.

==Examples==
A number of notions can be defined by passing to the left or right orthogonal several times starting from a list of explicit examples, i.e. as &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp\ell}, C^{\perp r}, C^{\perp\ell r}, C^{\perp\ell\ell}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a class consisting of several explicitly given morphisms. A useful intuition is to think that the property of left-lifting against a class ''C'' is a kind of negation
of the property of being in ''C'', and that right-lifting is also a kind of negation. Hence the classes obtained from ''C'' by taking orthogonals an odd number of times, such as &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp\ell}, C^{\perp r}, C^{\perp\ell r\ell}, C^{\perp\ell\ell\ell}&lt;/math&gt; etc., represent various kinds of negation of ''C'', so &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp\ell}, C^{\perp r}, C^{\perp\ell r\ell}, C^{\perp\ell\ell\ell}&lt;/math&gt; each consists of morphisms which are far from having property &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples of lifting properties in algebraic topology===
A map &lt;math&gt;f:U\to B&lt;/math&gt; has the ''path lifting property'' iff &lt;math&gt;\{0\}\longrightarrow [0,1] \perp f&lt;/math&gt; where 
&lt;math&gt;\{0\}\longrightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion of one end point of the closed interval into the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

A map &lt;math&gt;f:U\longrightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; has the [[homotopy lifting property]] iff &lt;math&gt; X \longrightarrow X\times [0,1] \perp f&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X\longrightarrow X\times [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is the map &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto (x,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples of lifting properties coming from model categories===
Fibrations and cofibrations.
* Let ''Top'' be the category of [[topological space]]s, and let &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; be the class of maps &lt;math&gt;S^n\longrightarrow D^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, embeddings of the boundary &lt;math&gt;S^n=\partial D^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; of a ball into the ball &lt;math&gt;D^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;WC_0&lt;/math&gt; be the class of maps embedding the upper semi-sphere into the disk. &lt;math&gt;WC_0^{\perp\ell}, WC_0^{\perp\ell r}, C_0^{\perp\ell}, C_0^{\perp\ell r}&lt;/math&gt; are the classes of fibrations, acyclic cofibrations, acyclic fibrations, and cofibrations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hovey | first = Mark |title = Model Categories }} Def. 2.4.3, Th.2.4.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let ''sSets'' be the category of [[simplicial set]]s. Let &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; be the class of boundary inclusions &lt;math&gt;\partial \Delta[n] \to \Delta[n]&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;WC_0&lt;/math&gt; be the class of horn inclusions &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^i[n] \to \Delta[n]&lt;/math&gt;. Then the classes of fibrations, acyclic cofibrations, acyclic fibrations, and cofibrations are, resp., &lt;math&gt;WC_0^{\perp\ell}, WC_0^{\perp\ell r}, C_0^{\perp\ell}, C_0^{\perp\ell r}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hovey | first = Mark |title = Model Categories }} Def. 3.2.1, Th.3.6.5&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ch}(R)&lt;/math&gt; be the category of [[chain complex]]es over a commutative ring ''R''. Let &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; be the class of maps of form

:: &lt;math&gt;\cdots\to 0\to R \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots \longrightarrow \cdots \to R \xrightarrow{\operatorname{id}} R \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots, &lt;/math&gt;

: and &lt;math&gt;WC_0&lt;/math&gt; be

:: &lt;math&gt; \cdots \to 0\to 0 \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots \longrightarrow \cdots \to R \xrightarrow{\operatorname{id}} R \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots. &lt;/math&gt;

:Then &lt;math&gt;WC_0^{\perp\ell}, WC_0^{\perp\ell r}, C_0^{\perp\ell}, C_0^{\perp\ell r}&lt;/math&gt; are the classes of fibrations, acyclic cofibrations, acyclic fibrations, and cofibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hovey | first = Mark |title = Model Categories }} Def. 2.3.3, Th.2.3.11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shimer College Susan Henking listening 2013 cropped.jpg|thumb|Listening in conversation.]]
'''Listening''' is giving one's attention to sound, for example [[speech]], [[music]] or natural sounds. Listening involves complex affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halone|first1=Kelby|last2=Cunconan|first2=Terry|last3=Coakley|first3=Carolyn|last4=Wolvin|first4=Andrew|title=Toward the establishment of general dimensions underlying the listening process.|journal=International Journal of Listening|date=1998|volume=12|pages=12–28|doi=10.1080/10904018.1998.10499016|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10904018.1998.10499016?journalCode=hijl20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective processes include the motivation to attend to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving, and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding with verbal and nonverbal feedback.

==What is listening?==
Listening differs from [[Obedience (human behavior)|obeying]].  A person who receives and understands information or an instruction, and then chooses not to comply with it or to agree to it, has listened to the speaker, even though the result is not what the speaker wanted.&lt;ref&gt;Purdy, Michael and Deborah Borisoff, eds. (1997) ''Listening in Everyday Life: A Personal and Professional Approach.  ''University Press of America.  {{ISBN|9780761804611}}.  p. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Listening is a term in which the listener listens to the one who produced the sound to be listened.

==Barthes==
Semiotician [[Roland Barthes]] characterized the distinction between listening and hearing as "Hearing is a physiological phenomenon; listening is a psychological act." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=The Responsibility of Forms|year=1985|publisher=New York Hill and Wang|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing is always occurring, most of the time subconsciously. In contrast, listening is the interpretative action taken by the listener in order to understand and potentially make meaning out of the sound waves. Listening can be understood on three levels:  alerting, deciphering, and  an understanding of how the sound is produced and how the sound affects the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=In the Responsibility of Forms|year=1985|publisher=New York Hill and Wang|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alerting, the first level, is the detection of environmental sound cues. While discussing this level, Barthes mentions the idea of territory being demarcated by sounds. This is best explained using the example of one's home. One's home, for instance, has certain sounds associated with it that make it familiar and comfortable. An intrusion sound (e.g. a squeaking door or floorboard, a breaking window) alerts the dweller of the home to the potential danger.

Deciphering, the second level, describes detecting patterns in and interpreting sounds. An example of this level is that of a child waiting for the sound of his mother's return home. In this scenario the child is waiting to pick up on sound cues (e.g. jingling keys, the turn of the doorknob, etc.) that will mark his mother's approach.

Understanding, the third level of listening, means knowing how what one says will affect another. This sort of listening is important in [[psychoanalysis]]. Barthes states that the psychoanalyst must turn off their judgement while listening to the analysand in order to communicate with their patient's unconscious in an unbiased fashion.

However, in contrast to the distinct levels of listening listed above, it must be understood that they all function within the same plane, and sometimes all at once. Specifically the second and third levels, which overlap vastly, can be intertwined in that obtaining, understanding and deriving meaning are part of the same process. In that the child, upon hearing the doorknob turn (obtaining), can almost automatically assume that someone is at the door (deriving meaning).

==In language learning==
Along with [[speaking]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], and [[writing]], listening is one of the "four skills" of [[language learning]]. All [[language teaching]] approaches except for [[grammar-translation]] incorporate a listening component.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Second Language Listening: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0521786479|isbn=0521786479|first1=John |last1=Flowerdew|first2=Lindsay|last2=Miller|year=2005|page=4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some teaching methods, such as [[Total Physical Response]], involve students simply listening and responding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Language Arts to English Language Learners|page=171
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0415641446
|first1=Anete|last1=Vásquez|first2=Angela L. |last2=Hansen|first3=Philip C. |last3=Smith
|year=2013|isbn=0415641446|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is often made between "intensive listening", in which learners attempt to listen with maximum accuracy to a relatively brief sequence of speech, and "extensive listening", in which learners listen to lengthy passages for general comprehension.  While intensive listening may be more effective in terms of developing specific aspects of listening ability, extensive listening is more effective in building [[fluency]] and maintaining learner [[motivation]].{{sfn|Flowerdew|2005|p=14}}

'''Mayhem''' is a [[common law]] [[criminal offense]] consisting of the intentional [[maiming]] of another person.

Under the law of [[England and Wales]] and other common law jurisdictions, it originally consisted of the intentional and wanton removal of a body part that would handicap a person's ability to defend themself in [[combat]]. Under the strict common law definition, initially this required damage to an eye or a limb, while cutting off an ear or a nose was deemed not sufficiently disabling. Later the meaning of the crime expanded to encompass any mutilation, disfigurement, or crippling act done using any instrument.

==In England==

===History of definitions===
{{update|type=section|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- See talk page, section "Abolition in England and Wales" --&gt;
In England and Wales, it has fallen into disuse. In 1992 [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|the Law Commission]] recommended that it be abolished,&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission, Consultation Paper No.122, Offences Against the Person and General Principles, Appendix A, Draft Criminal Law Bill, clause 31(1)(a)(iii) at page 90 of the report [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1992/c122.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1998 the [[Home Office]] proposed to abolish it, in the course of codifying the law relating to [[offences against the person]].&lt;ref&gt;The Home Office. 1998. Violence: Reforming the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. {{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-1998-violence-reforming-law/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227012915/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-1998-violence-reforming-law/ |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }} Draft Offences Against the Person Bill, clause 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fetter v. Beale''===
The most significant change in common-law mayhem doctrine came in 1697, when the King's Bench decided ''Fetter v. Beale'', 91 Eng. Rep. 1122. There, the plaintiff recovered in a battery action against a defendant. Shortly thereafter, "part of his skull by reason of the said battery came out of his head", and the plaintiff brought a subsequent action under mayhem. Though ''Fetter'' is also known as an early example of [[res judicata]], it is most significant for expanding the ambit of mayhem to include "loss of the skull".

==The modern doctrine==
In modern times, the offense of mayhem has been superseded in many [[jurisdiction]]s by statutorily defined offenses such as [[aggravated battery]].

==In the United States==
Modern statutes in the U.S. define mayhem as disabling or disfiguring, such as rendering useless a member of another person's arms or legs.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=203. Cal. Pen. Code Sec. 203]&lt;/ref&gt; The injury must be permanent, not just a temporary loss.  Some courts will hold even a minor battery as mayhem if the injury is not minor.  Mayhem in the U.S. is a [[felony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dix |first=George E. |year=2010 |title=Gilbert Law Summaries on Criminal Law |publisher=Thomson/West |isbn=978-0-314-19430-5 |pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Both the noun "mayhem" and the verb "[[:wiktionary:maim|maim]]" come from [[Old French]] via [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]].  The word is first attested in various [[Romance languages]] in the 13th century, but its ultimate origin is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Third edition, June 2000; online version June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For one hypothesis about its origin, see [[wiktionary:mayhem|the Wiktionary entry for this word]].

==Other uses==
Mayhem can describe a person going on a [[Killing spree|rampage]]. Popular misunderstanding of the common [[journalese]] expression "[[rioting]] and mayhem" caused the common usual modern use of "mayhem" to mean "havoc and disorder", often with humorous overtones.

'''Mental operations''' are operations that affect [[mind|mental]] contents. Initially, operations of [[reasoning]] have been the object of [[logic]] alone. [[Pierre Janet]] was one of the first to use the concept in psychology. Mental operations have been investigated at a developmental level by [[Jean Piaget]], and from a [[psychometric]] perspective by [[J. P. Guilford]]. There is also a cognitive approach to the subject, as well as a systems view of it.

==History==
Since [[Ancient history|Antiquity]], mental operations, more precisely, formal operations of [[reasoning]] have been the object of [[logic]].&lt;ref name="hobh"&gt;[[Hobhouse, LT]] (2005). ''The Theory of Knowledge: A Contribution to Some Problems of Logic and Metaphysics'', Kessinger Publishing, p. 223. {{ISBN|978-1-4179-6206-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, Pierre Janet described two types of mental operations:&lt;ref name="vals"&gt;Valsiner, Jaan; van der Veer, René (2000). ''The social mind: construction of the idea.'' Cambridge University Press, pp. 103-106. {{ISBN|0-521-58973-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* reality operations - mental operations under the control of logic;
* disinterested operations - escaping the control of reason.
Jean Piaget differentiated a [[preoperational stage]], and operational stages of [[cognitive development]], on the basis of presence of mental operations as an [[adaptation]] tool.&lt;ref name="gins"&gt;Ginsburg, Herbert; Opper, Sylvia (1979). ''Piaget's Theory of Intellectual Development.'' Prentice Hall, p. 152. {{ISBN|0-13-675140-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

J. P. Guilford's Structure of Intellect model described up to 180 different intellectual abilities organized along three dimensions—Operations, Content, and Products.&lt;ref name="guilf"&gt;Guilford, Joy Paul (1980). Some changes in the structure of intellect model. ''Educational and Psychological Measurement'' '''48''': 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical view==
According to 
most logicians, the three primary mental operations are [[apprehension (understanding)]], [[judgement]], and [[inference]].&lt;ref name="hobh" /&gt;

===Apprehension===
Apprehension is the mental operation by which an idea is formed in the mind. If you were to think of a sunset or a baseball, the action of forming that picture in your mind is apprehension. The verbal expression of apprehension is called a term.

===Judgment===
Judgment is the mental operation by which we predicate something of a subject. Were you to think, "That sunset is beautiful" or "Baseball is the all-American sport" is to make a judgment. The verbal expression of judgment is the statement (or proposition).

===Inference===
Inference (or reasoning) is the mental operation by which we draw conclusions from other information. If you were to think, "I like to look at that sunset, because I enjoy beautiful things, and that sunset is beautiful" you would be reasoning. The verbal expression of reasoning is the logical argument.&lt;ref name="hobh"/&gt;

==Developmental view==
[[Jean Piaget]] identifies several mental operations of the [[concrete operational stage]] of [[cognitive development]]:&lt;ref name="gins"/&gt;
[[File:Piagetian operations.jpg|thumb|400px|Mental operations according to Jean Piaget.]]
*''Seriation''—the ability to sort objects in an order according to size, shape, or any other characteristic. For example, if given different-shaded objects they may make a color gradient.
*''Transitivity''—The ability to recognize logical relationships among elements in a serial order, and perform 'transitive inferences' (for example, If A is taller than B, and B is taller than C, then A must be taller than C).
*''Classification''—the ability to name and identify sets of objects according to appearance, size or other characteristic, including the idea that one set of objects can include another.
*''Decentering''—where the child takes into account multiple aspects of a problem to solve it. For example, the child will no longer perceive an exceptionally wide but short cup to contain less than a normally-wide, taller cup.
*''Reversibility''—the child understands that numbers or objects can be changed, then returned to their original state. For this reason, a child will be able to rapidly determine that if 4+4 equals t, t−4 will equal 4, the original quantity.
*''Conservation''—understanding that quantity, length or number of items is unrelated to the arrangement or appearance of the object or items.

Piaget also describes a [[formal operational stage]], with formal operations of [[abstract thinking]]: hypothesizing, [[hypothesis]] testing, and [[deductive reasoning|deduction]].&lt;ref name="gins" /&gt;

==Psychometric view==
[[File:Guilford model.jpg|thumb|400px|Guilford's Structure of Intellect.]]
According to [[J. P. Guilford]]'s Structure of Intellect (SI) theory, an individual's performance on intelligence tests can be traced back to the underlying mental abilities or factors of intelligence. SI theory comprises multiple intellectual abilities organized along three dimensions—Operations, Content, and Products.&lt;ref name="guil"&gt;Guilford, Joy Paul (1950). Creativity. ''American Psychologist'' '''5''' (9): 444-454.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Operations dimension''

SI includes six operations or general intellectual processes:
Cognition—The ability to understand, comprehend, discover, and become aware of information.
Memory recording—The ability to encode information.
Memory retention—The ability to recall information.
Divergent production—The ability to generate multiple solutions to a problem; creativity.
Convergent production—The ability to deduce a single solution to a problem; rule-following or problem-solving.
Evaluation—The ability to judge whether or not information is accurate, consistent, or valid.

*''Content dimension''

SI includes five broad areas of information to which the human intellect applies the six operations:
Visual—Information perceived through seeing.
Auditory—Information perceived through hearing.
Kinesthetic -through actions
Symbolic—Information perceived as symbols or signs that have no meaning by themselves; e.g., Arabic numerals or the letters of an alphabet.
Semantic—Information perceived in words or sentences, whether oral, written, or silently in one's mind.
Behavioral—Information perceived as acts of people.

*''Product dimension''

As the name suggests, this dimension contains results of applying particular operations to specific contents. The SI model includes six products, in increasing complexity:
Units—Single items of knowledge.
Classes—Sets of units sharing common attributes.
Relations—Units linked as opposites or in associations, sequences, or analogies.
Systems—Multiple relations interrelated to comprise structures or networks.
Transformations—Changes, perspectives, conversions, or mutations to knowledge.
Implications—Predictions, inferences, consequences, or anticipations of knowledge.

Therefore, according to Guilford there are 6 x 5 x 6 = 180 intellectual abilities or factors. Each ability stands for a particular operation in a particular content area and results in a specific product, such as Comprehension of Figural Units or Evaluation of Semantic Implications.&lt;ref name="guilf" /&gt;

==Cognitive view==
[[File:Cognitive operations.jpg|thumb|350px|Mental operations: cognitive view.]]
Following on the footsteps of Silvio Ceccato,&lt;ref name="cec"&gt;Ceccato, Silvio (1961). ''Linguistic Analysis and Programming for Mechanical Translation''. G. Feltrinelli.&lt;/ref&gt; Giulio Benedetti describes several types of mental operations:&lt;ref name="ben"&gt;Benedetti, Giulio (2005).  [http://www.mind-consciousness-language.com/Elementary%20mental%20operations.pdf "Basic mental operations which make up mental categories"] (PDF). ''www.mind-consciousness-language.com''&lt;/ref&gt;
* attentional focalization - focusing [[attention]] on something;
* attentional discarding - stopping our attention on an object;
* spatial basic operating scheme (attentional movement) - passing attention from one part to another of the attentional field;
* operation of [[Representation (psychology)|representation]] - evoking a mental image;
* operation of [[Comparison (mathematics)|comparison]];
* operations of [[memory]];
* temporal basic operating scheme - variation of attentional focalization.

==Systems view==
[[File:Systemic operations.jpg|thumb|350px|Mental operations: systems view.]]
Taking into account all [[mental process]]es, the following types of mental operations have been described:&lt;ref name="sys"&gt;Tapu, Codrin Stefan (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WKZoAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en Hypostatic Personality: Psychopathology of Doing and Being Made]''. Premier, pp. 18-19. {{ISBN|973-8030-59-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[cognitive]] operations - production and verbalization of images and thoughts;
* practical operations, pertaining to [[executive functions]];
* [[affective]] operations - affective [[evaluation]] of the world and [[Self (psychology)|self]];
* expressive operations ([[emotional expression]]);
* perceptual-motor operations (e.g., [[eye-hand coordination]]);
* regulative operations - verbalization of needs, motives and feelings, and [[self-control]].

The '''''Mokṣopāya''''' or '''''Mokṣopāyaśāstra''''' is a [[Sanskrit]] philosophical text on salvation for non-ascetics (''mokṣa-upāya'': 'means to liberation'), written on the Pradyumna hill in [[Śrīnagar]] in the 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Slaje, Walter. (2005). "Locating the Mokṣopāya", in: Hanneder, Jürgen (Ed.). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pVgRAQAAIAAJ The Mokṣopāya, Yogavāsiṣṭha and Related Texts]'' Aachen: Shaker Verlag.

The main part of the text forms a dialogue between [[Vasiṣṭha]] and [[Rāma]], interchanged with [[Contents and stories of the Yoga Vasistha|numerous short stories and anecdotes]] to illustrate the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leslie|2003|pp=104–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lekh-state"&gt;Lekh Raj Manjdadria.

''[http://www.indologie.uni-halle.de/forschung/Moksopaya/introduction.htm Mokṣopāya Project: Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228130128/http://www.indologie.uni-halle.de/forschung/Moksopaya/introduction.htm |date=2005-12-28 }}.''&lt;/ref&gt; expanded and [[Vedanta|vedanticized]], which resulted in the ''[[Yogavāsiṣṭha]]''.&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-x-xi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|pp=x-xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
The text of the ''Mokṣopāya'' shows that a unique philosophy has been created by the author. It taught a [[monism]] ('advaita') that is different from [[Advaita Vedanta]]. It makes use of other [[Darśana]]s in an [[syncretism|inclusive]] way. The text teaches that the recognition that [[Cognition|cognitive]] objects are [[Existence|non-existent]], leads to ultimate detachment, which causes an attitude of "dispassion and non-involvement with worldly things and matters", though still fulfilling one's daily duties and activities.&lt;ref name="lekh-state" /&gt; This [[Moksha|liberation]] is available for everyone, no matter their sex, caste or education, as long as one uses reason and maintains an active life in this world. To reach this liberation, one has to go through three stages: rational thinking and discernment (''[[vicāra]]''), true understanding (''[[Jnana|jñāna]]'') and detachment (''[[Vairagya|vairāgya]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leslie|2003|pp=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is only by one's own effort (''pauruṣa'') that one can be liberated from the bonds of existence. For one who knows the reality, "fate" (''daiva'') does not mean anything, something like "fate" does not exist and has, accordingly, no consequences at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hanneder|2006|pp=xi, 199–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slaje, Walter (2000). "Wie man sein Schicksal (daiva) meistert. Der Mokṣopāya über Wesen und Wirksamkeit menschlicher Aktivität (pauruṣa)", in: Asiatische Studien 54, pp. 63-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mokṣopāya Project==
[[File:Utpattiprakarana-sample.jpg|thumb|Sample of the critical edition of the Utpattiprakaraṇa Moksopaya]]
The Mokṣopāya Project supervised by professor Walter Slaje at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg]] in [[Germany]] is currently working on a [[Textual criticism|critical edition]] of the ''Mokṣopāya''.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Hanneder. (2000). ''[http://www.indologie.uni-halle.de/forschung/Moksopaya/results.pdf Notes on the Quality of the Text]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''.&lt;/ref&gt; The project is embedded in the Centre for Research in the Historiography and Intellectual Culture of Kashmir (under the Patronage of the Academy of Sciences and Literature, Mainz). A commentary by [[Bhaskarakantha|Bhāskarakaṇṭha]] (''"Mokṣopāya-ṭīkā"''; late 17th century AD)&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexis Sanderson|Sanderson, Alexis]] (2007): "The Śaiva Exegesis of Kashmir", in: ''Mélanges tantriques à la mémoire d’Hélène Brunner: Tantric studies in memory of Hélène Brunner.'' edited by Dominic Goodall &amp; André Padoux (Collection Indologie; 106) Pondicherry: Inst. Français de Pondichéry, pp. 231-442 (p. 422).&lt;/ref&gt; and more than thirty manuscripts in [[Nagari|Nāgarī]], Śāradā, [[Grantha script|Grantha]], and [[Telugu script|Telugu]] scripts are being used.&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, Patrick. ''[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2081/is_n1_v117/ai_n28688505/?tag=content;col1 Bhaskarakanthas Moksopaya-Tika: Die Fragmente des 3. Prakarana]''. Journal of the American Oriental Society.

The critical edition of the complete Sanskrit text is expected to be finalized by the end of 2018. It will be accompanied by a German translation, a philological commentary and a dictionary of its Sanskrit vocabulary (all in German).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12207">The '''myth of superabundance''' is the belief that [[earth]] has more than sufficient [[natural resources]] to satisfy humanity's needs, and that no matter how much of these resources humanity uses, the planet will continuously replenish the supply.  Although the idea had existed previously among [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s in the 19th century, it was not given a name until [[Stewart Udall]]'s 1964 book ''The Quiet Crisis''.

Udall describes the myth as the belief that there was "so much land, so much water, so much timber, so many birds and beasts"&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|22}} that man did not envision a time where the planet would not replenish what had been sowed. The myth of superabundance began to circulate during [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s presidency at the beginning of the nineteenth century and persuaded many Americans to exploit natural resources as they pleased with no thought of long-term consequences.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; According to historian of the North American west [[George Colpitts]], "No theme became as integral to western promotion as natural abundance."&lt;ref name=Colpitts/&gt;{{rp|104}} Especially with respect to the west after 1890, promotional literature encouraged migration by invoking the idea that God had provided an abundant environment there such that no man or family would fail if they sought to farm or otherwise live off the land out west.&lt;ref name=Colpitts/&gt; Since at that time environmental science and the study of ecology barely allowed for the possibility of animal [[extinction]] and did not provide tools for measuring biomass or the limits of natural resources, many speculators, settlers, and other parties participated in unsustainable practices that led to various extinctions, the [[Dust Bowl]] phenomenon, and other [[environmental catastrophe]]s.

== Early manifestations ==
In 1784, [[John Filson]] wrote ''The Discovery, Settlement And present State of [[Kentucky|Kentucke]]'',&lt;ref name=Filson/&gt; which included the chapter "The Adventures of Colonel [[Daniel Boone|Daniel Boon]]".  This work represents one of the earliest instance of the myth of superabundance, acting as something of a promotional ad enticing settlers to Kentucky based on the abundance of resources to be found there.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;

== Warning signs ==
Udall describes many large-scale impacts on natural resources, terming them "The Big Raid on resources".&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|54}} The first was the need for [[logging|lumber]] in a growing nation for [[fuel]], [[housing]] and [[paper]]. Udall states that it was with this first big raid on the earth’s natural resources that the myth of superabundance began to show its fallacy. It was only towards the end of the nineteenth century that people were awakened to the empty hillsides and the vastness of blackened woods from the [[lumber industry]]. [[Petroleum]] followed, as it was widely believed that oil was constantly made inside the earth, and so, like everything else, was inexhaustible. Then came [[seal hunting]], and by 1866 the seal population that originally numbered approximately five million was drastically cut in half.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; Many of the seals were shot in the water and never recovered, allowing for enormous waste. The [[Fur Seal Treaty]] which came about in 1911 saved the seals from becoming the first major marine species to become extinct thanks to the myth of superabundance.

The [[passenger pigeon]] was the largest wildlife species known to humanity in the early nineteenth century, when the bird's population was estimated at about five billion.  By the early 20th century, due to [[overhunting]] and habitat destruction brought about by the timber industry, the species had become extinct, the last passenger pigeon having died in the Cincinnati Zoo.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; The passenger pigeon became extinct in under a century and was just one of the many victims of the myth of superabundance.{{synthesis inline|date=November 2016}}

Likewise, the [[American bison|American buffalo]] was threatened by the myth of superabundance. They were considered to be the largest and most valuable resource because just about every piece of them was usable. The big kill of the buffalo began at the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when armies wanted the animals killed in order to starve out the [[Plains Indians]]. Railroad men wanted them killed in order to supply heavier and profitable loads of hides. Buffalo were killed for their tongues and hides, and some hunters simply wanted them as trophies. Pleas of protection for the buffalo were ignored, nearly wiping out the species.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;

The [[Great Leap Forward]] in [[China]] in 1958 corresponded closely with the myth of superabundance;{{synthesis inline|date=November 2016}} economic planners reduced the acreage space for planting wheat and grains, trying to force farmers and agricultural labourers into accepting new forms of [[industry]]. As a result, production of wheat and grain was slowed dangerously, and floods in [[Southern China|the South]] and droughts in the North struck in 1959, leading China into the record-breaking [[Great Chinese Famine]].&lt;ref name=Mokyr/&gt;

== The myth exposed ==
[[George Perkins Marsh]], who wrote ''[[Man and Nature]]'' in 1864, rejected the idea that any resource could be exploited without any concerns for the future. Perkins was a witness to natural destruction; he saw that mistakes of the past were destroying the present prosperity. He believed that nature should be second nature to all and should not be used as an exploitation for economics and politics. He was, after all, "forest born".&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|72}} Man's role as a catalyst of change in the natural world intrigued him. He believed that progress was entirely possible and necessary, if only men used wisdom in the management of resources. He deflated, but did not destroy the myth of superabundance. He began the spin into doubt,&lt;ref name=Marsh/&gt; which made way for [[John Muir]] in 1874. Muir, who had grown up surrounded by wilderness, believed that wildlife and nature could provide people with heightened sense abilities and experiences of awe that could be found nowhere else.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; Entering into civilization with a desire to see preservation of some of what he believed to be America’s most beautiful nature, he built upon steps that had been taken by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], a young landscape architect who designed [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]]. Olmsted had persuaded [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass a bill preserving much of [[Yosemite Valley]], which [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] had then approved in 1864. In 1872 [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] signed the Yellowstone Park bill, saving over two million acres of wildlife.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;

== Early successes ==
Muir saw [[overgrazing]] destruction in Yosemite, in parts of it that were not under protection. It was a result of nearby [[Sheep husbandry|sheepmen]] and their herds.&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;Overgrazing would later spark a feud of conflicting beliefs between Muir and Glifford Pinchot, the Department of Agriculture’s Chief Forester, who were actually friends. They clashed over sheep-grazing practices, because Pinchot believed that controlled grazing was useful in the forest preserves, but Muir believed that it was a bad practice to use at all. Pinchot is known to have later rescinded his argument, saying that Muir was indeed, right.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, Muir wrote an article "God’s First Temples – How Shall We Preserve Our Forests", which he published in the newspaper, pleading for help with protection of the forests. At first he failed against the overriding ideal of the myth of superabundance, but he did inspire bills in the 1880s that sought to enlarge Yosemite’s reservation. Muir formed the [[Sierra Club]], a group of mountaineers and conservationists like him who had responded to his many articles. The Sierra Club’s first big fight came as a counter-attack on lumbermen and [[Cowboy|stockmen]] who wanted to monopolize some of Yosemite County. Yosemite Valley, which was still owned by the state, was mismanaged and natural reserves like the meadows and Mirror Lake, which was dammed for irrigation, were still being destroyed even under supposed protection.  In 1895, Muir and the Sierra Club began a battle that would span over ten years, fighting for natural management of Yosemite Valley. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] met with Muir in 1903 and was instantly fascinated with Muir’s passion for the wilderness. Roosevelt approved Muir’s argument for Yosemite Valley, and so the Sierra Club took their decade long campaign to Sacramento, where they finally won against California legislature in 1905. With Roosevelt on Muir’s side, Yosemite Valley finally became part of the Yosemite National Park and was allowed natural management.

== Moving backwards ==
Udall asserts that the myth of superabundance, once exposed, was replaced in the 20th century by the ''myth of scientific supremacy'': the belief that science can eventually find a solution to any problem.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|178}}  This leads to behaviors which, while recognizing that resources are not infinite, still fail to properly preserve those resources, putting the problem off to future generations to solve through science.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; "Present the repair bill to the next generation" is their silent motto.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|178}} George Perkins Marsh had said that conservation's greatest enemies were "greed and shortsightedness".&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|178}} Men reach a power trip thinking they can manipulate nature the way that they want.

== Next steps ==
In order for man to live harmoniously with nature, as Muir and Perkins and many others have fought for, Patsy Hallen in the article, "The Art of Impurity" says that an ethics development must occur in which respect for nature and our radical dependency on it can take place. Humans see themselves as superior to nature, and yet we are in a constant state of continuity with it. Hallen argues that humanity cannot afford such an irrational state of mind and ecological denial if it expects to prosper in the future.&lt;ref name=Hallen/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12159">According to [[Franz Brentano]], [[intentionality]] refers to the "aboutness of mental states that cannot be a physical relation between a mental state and what is about (its object) because in a physical relation each of the relata must exist whereas the objects of mental states might not.

Several problems arise for features of intentionality, which are unusual for materialistic relations.  Representation is unique. When 'x represents y' is true, it is not the same as other relations between things, like when 'x is next to y' or when 'x caused y' or when 'x met y', etc. Representation is different because, for instance, when 'x represents y' is true, y need not exist. This isn't true when say 'x is the square root of y' or 'x caused y' or 'x is next to y'. Similarly, when 'x represents y' is true, 'x represents z' can still be false, even when y = z.  Intentionality encompasses relations that are both physical and mental. In this case, "Billy can love Santa and Jane can search for unicorns even if Santa does not exist and there are no unicorns."

==History==
'''[[Franz Brentano]]''', the nineteenth century philosopher, spoke of mental states as involving presentations of the objects of our thoughts.  This idea encompasses his belief that one cannot desire something unless they actually have a representation of it in their minds.

'''[[Dennis Stampe]]''' was one of the first philosophers in modern times to suggest a theory of content according to which content is a matter of reliable causes.

'''[[Fred Dretske]]'''{{'}}s book, ''Knowledge and the Flow of Information'' (1981), was a major influence on the development of informational theories, and although the theory developed there is not a teleological theory, Dretske (1986, 1988, 1991) later produced an informational version of [[teleosemantics]].  He begins with a concept of carrying information that he calls "indicating", explains that indicating is not equivalent to representing, and then suggests that a representation's content is what it has the function of indicating

==Related theories==

'''Teleosemantics''', also known as biosemantics, is used to refer to the class of theories of mental content that use a teleological notion of function. Teleosemantics is best understood as a general strategy for underwriting the normative nature of content, rather than any particular theory. What all teleological theories have in common is the idea that semantic norms are ultimately derivable from functional norms.

Attempts to naturalize semantics began in the late 1970s.  Many attempts were and still are being made to bring natural-physical explanations to bear on minds and, specifically, to the question of how minds acquire content.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Adams, Fred. "Thoughts and Their Contents: Naturalized Semantics." In Philosophy of Mind 143.&lt;/ref&gt;   This is an interesting question; it is no surprise that it takes center stage in the philosophy of mind.  Indeed, it is certainly an interesting question how minds, thought by those in the natural camp to be "natural physical objects",&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; could have developed intentional properties.  In the mid-1980s, with the works of Ruth Millikan and David Papineau (Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories and "Representation and Explanation", respectively) teleosemantics, a theory of mental content that attempts to address the question of content and intentionality of minds, was born.

Ruth Millikan is perhaps the most vocal supporter of the teleosemantic program. Millikan's view differs from other teleosemantic views in myriad ways, but perhaps its most unusual characteristic is its distinction between the mechanisms that produce mental representations from those that consume mental representations.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Macdonald, G, and Papineau, D. "Prospects and Problems for Teleosemantics," in Teleosemantics 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   There is a representational function as a whole, at a composite level; and there are two "sub-functions",&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Nicholas. "Millikan's Contribution to Materialist Philosophy of Mind," 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  the producer-function and the consumer-function.  In terms that are easy to understand, let's take Millikan's own example of beavers splashing their tails.  One beaver alerts other beavers to the presence of danger by splashing its tail on the surface of water.  The splashing of the tail tells, or represents to, the other beavers that there is danger in the environment, and the other beavers dip into the water to avoid the danger.  The splashing of the beaver's tail produces a representation; the other beavers consume the representation.  The representation that the beavers consume guides their behavior in ways that relate to their survival.

Of course, the foci of the teleosemantic program is internal representations, and not just representational states of affairs between two (or more) distinct, external  entities.  How does the picture of the producer and consumer beavers, for instance, play into a story about internal representations?  Papineau and Macdonald describe Millikan's account of this well and loyally, saying "The producing mechanisms will be the sensory and other cerebral mechanisms that give rise to cognitive representations."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;   The consuming mechanisms are those that "use these representations to direct behavior in pursuit of some biological end".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;   Here, we have a picture similar to the beaver example, but this picture portrays the two sub-functions, producer and consumer, operating within a more-obviously unified system, namely, the cognitive system.  One sub-function produces mental representations while the other sub-function consumes them in order to reach some end, e.g., danger-avoidance or food-acquisition.  The representations consumed by the consumer sub-function guide an organism's behavior toward some biological end, e.g., survival.  This is a rather brief sketch of Millikan's overall portrait.  Of course, more goes into her account of the relation between producer- and consumer-functions in order to arrive at a nuanced account of mental representation.  But that is a matter of how.  Details as to the how aside, much of Millikan's efforts are directed towards the why, viz., why it is that perceivers like us have mental representations—why representations are produced in the first place.

'''The theory of asymmetric dependence''', from Fodor, who says that his theory "distinguishes merely informational relations on the basis of their higher-order relations to each other: informational relations depend upon representational relations, but not vice versa. He gives an example of this theory when he says, "if tokens of a mental state type are reliably caused by horses, cows-on-dark-nights, zebras-in-the-mist and Great Danes, then they carry information about horses, etc. If however, such tokens are caused by cows-on-dark-nights, etc. because they are caused by horses, but not vice versa, then they represent horses (or property horse).

==Alternative theories==

===Indeterminacy of translation===

20th century American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] believed that linguistic terms do not have distinct meanings that accompany them because there are no such entities as "meanings". In his books, ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960) and ''[[Ontological Relativity]]'' (1968), Quine considers the methods available to a field linguist attempting to translate an unknown language in order to outline his thesis. His thesis, the [[indeterminacy of translation]], notes that there are many different ways to distribute purpose and meanings among words. Whenever a theory of translation is made it is commonly based upon context. An argument over the correct translation of an unidentified term depends on the possibility that the native could have spoken a different sentence. The same problem of indeterminacy would appear in this argument once again since any hypothesis can be defended if one adopts enough compensatory hypotheses about other parts of the language. Quine uses as an example the word "gavagai" spoken by a native upon seeing a rabbit. One can go the simplest route and translate the word to "Lo, a rabbit", but other possible translations such as "Lo, food" or "Let's go hunting" are completely reasonable given what the linguist knows. Subsequent observations can rule out certain possibilities as well as questioning the natives. But this is only possible once the linguist has mastered much of the [[natives']] grammar and vocabulary. This is a big problem because this can only be done on the basis of hypotheses derived from simpler, observation-connected bits of language, which admit multiple interpretations, as we have seen.

===The intentional stance===

[[Daniel C. Dennett]]'s theory of mental content, the intentional stance, tries to view the behavior of things in terms of mental properties. According to Dennett: 
"Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do."

Dennett's thesis has three levels of abstraction:
# The most tangible is the physical stance, which is at the level of physics and chemistry. This level is concerned with things such as mass, energy, velocity, and chemical composition. 
# Somewhat more abstract is the design stance, which is at the level of biology and engineering. This level is concerned with things such as purpose, function and design. 
# Most abstract is the intentional stance, which is at the level of software and minds. This level is concerned with things such as belief, thinking and intent.

Dennett states that the more concrete the level, the more accurate is in principle our predictions. Though if one chooses to view an object through a more abstract level, he will gain greater computational power by getting a better overall picture of the object and skipping over any extraneous details. Also, switching to a more abstract level has its risks as well as its benefits. If we applied the intentional stance to a thermometer that was heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C, trying to understand it through its beliefs about how hot it is and its desire to keep the temperature just right, we would gain no useful information. The problem would not be understood until we dropped down to the physical stance to comprehend that it has been melted. Whether to take a particular stance should be decided by how successful that stance is when applied. Dennett argued that it is best to understand human beliefs and desires at the level of the intentional stance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6561">'''Nets within Nets''' is a modelling method belonging to the family of [[Petri net]]s.
This method is distinguished from other sorts of Petri nets by the possibility to provide their tokens with a proper structure, which is based on Petri net modelling again. Hence, a net can contain further net items, being able to move around and fire themselves.

== Motivation ==

Nets within nets are well suited for the modelling of distributed systems under the particular aspects of
* hierarchy,
* mobility
* encapsulation.

In a lot of publications in relation to [[object-oriented design]]  is  given,  in order to combine the ability of Petri nets in modelling distributed computing with the modelling of objects, being able to be created and to interact.

== History ==

Starting from the need of practical applications, by the mid of nineties, different formalisms have been created, which fit the description of „nets within nets“. Lomazova and Schnoebelen are listing&lt;ref&gt;Irina A. Lomazova, Philippe Schnoebelen: ''Some decidability results for nested Petri nets'', Springer LNCS 1755, 2000, pp. 208-220&lt;/ref&gt;
some of these approaches, namely by Sibertin-Blanc,&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Sibertin-Blanc: ''Cooperative Nets'', Springer LNCS 815, 1994, pp. 471-490&lt;/ref&gt; Lakos,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lakos: ''From coloured Petri nets to object Petri nets'', Springer LNCS 935, 1995, pp. 278-297&lt;/ref&gt; Moldt und Wienberg&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moldt und Frank Wienberg: ''Multi-agent-systems based on coloured Petri nets'', Springer LNCS 1248, 1997, pp. 82-101&lt;/ref&gt;  as extending [[Coloured Petri net]]s,  aside the Object Nets of Valk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Petri nets as token objects'', Springer LNCS 1420, 1998, pp. 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest use of such hierarchic net models appeared by [[Rüdiger Valk]] in Valk and Jessen,&lt;ref&gt;Eike Jessen, [[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Rechensysteme: Grundlagen der Modellbildung'', Springer, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  where the so-called task-flow nets&lt;ref&gt;[[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Modelling Concurrency by Task/Flow EN Systems''. Proceedings 3rd Workshop on Concurrency and Compositionality, GMD-Studien Nr. 191, Bonn, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  are introduced in order to model task systems in operating systems. In these models tasks are modelled by a Petri net, which represents the precedences of tasks and their state of execution.

== Semantics ==

The most important differences in semantics is given by the execution of net tokens. On the one side net tokens can be [[Reference (programming)|references]]  to net items,&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Kummer: ''Referenznetze'', Dissertation, Universität Hamburg, Logos Verlag Berlin 2002&lt;/ref&gt; which case is called „reference semantics“. This kind of semantic is distinguished from [[value semantics]], where net objects may exist in different places and different internal states. In value semantics different copies can be created to model concurrent execution. The corresponding join of such a split can be defined in different ways, as for instance by „distributed token semantics“&lt;ref&gt;Michael Köhler, Heiko Rölke: ''Properties of Object Petri Nets''. Springer LNCS 3099, 2004, pp. 278-297&lt;/ref&gt;   or „history process semantics“.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Object Petri Nets'', Springer LNCS 3098, 2004, pp. 819-848&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with mobile computing hybrid versions of reference and value semantics are of importance.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt Farwer, Michael Köhler: ''Modelling global and local name spaces for mobile agents using object nets'', Fundamenta Informaticae, Vol. 72, No 1, pp. 109-122, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In distributed token semantics the important calculus of place invariants for Petri nets remains  valid.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Köhler-Bußmeier, Daniel Moldt: ''Analysis of mobile agents using invariants of object nets''.

The formalism of nets within nets would be of few importance without communication between net tokens. Like in [[object-oriented programming]]  communication of net tokens is    introduced via predefined interfaces which are dynamically bound.

[[File:forthandback.svg|thumb|Figure 1: Nested Petri net containing channels via inscriptions]]

In Figure 1 a Petri net is shown containing a token Petri net in place „a“. The token net can move around from place „a“ to place „b“ and back by firing of the transitions of the outer net. The channel inscriptions at the transitions behave like a call of a [[Method (computer programming)|method]], resulting in the synchronised firing of the calling transition in the outer net [e.g. labelled by x:forth()] and the called transition [e.g. labelled by :forth()] in the token net. The variable „x“ at an arrow is bound to the token net in the place connected with this arrow. The brackets may contain parameters to be passed. This example is so simple that reference and value semantics coincide.

== Algorithms and restricted formalisms ==

Standard Petri net properties like [[Petri net|reachability]], [[Petri net|boundedness]] and [[Petri net|liveness]] show a mixed picture. A paper &lt;ref&gt;Michael Köhler-Bußmeier: ''A Survey of Decidability Results for Elementary Object Systems'': Fundamenta Informaticae, Vol.  130, No 1, pp. 99-123, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; of  Köhler-Bußmeier gives a survey on decidability results for elementary object systems.
To reduce the complexity of the formalism subclasses have been defined by restricting the structure of the Petri nets, as for instance to state machines. Such restrictions still allow complex modelling of distributed and mobile systems, but have polynomial complexity in [[model checking]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Heitmann, Michael Köhler-Bußmeier: ''P- and t-systems in the nets-within-nets formalism'': Springer LNCS 7347, 2012, pp. 368-387&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Чтобы больше иметь — надо больше производить. Чтобы больше производить — надо больше знать.jpg|thumb|1920 propaganda poster: "In order to have more, it is necessary to produce more. In order to produce more, it is necessary to know more."]]
The '''New Soviet man''' or '''New Soviet person''' ({{lang-ru|новый советский человек}} ''novy sovetsky chelovek''), as postulated by the [[State ideology of the Soviet Union|ideologists]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], was an [[archetype]] of a person with specific qualities that were said to be emerging as dominant among all citizens of the [[Soviet Union]], irrespective of the country's cultural, ethnic, and linguistic diversity, creating a single [[Soviet people]], Soviet nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolay Vasilyevich Ustryalov|Nikolay Ustryalov]], ''From [[New Economic Policy|NEP]] to Soviet Socialism'' (1934) ([http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/philos/ustryalov/ustry035.htm text online]) {{ru icon}} {{Page needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intent==

From the ideology's roots in the mid 19th and early 20th century, ideologists of [[Communism]] have postulated that within the new society of [[Stateless communism|pure communism]] and the social conditions therein, a New Man and New Woman would develop with qualities reflecting surrounding circumstances of post-scarcity and unprecedented scientific development.&lt;ref&gt;

For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] wrote in 1924 in ''[[Literature and Revolution]]'' about the "Communist man", "man of the future":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lit_revo/ch08.htm |title=Ch. 8 '&amp;#39;Revolutionary and Socialist Art |publisher=Marxists.org |date=2007-01-06 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Reich]] asked in 1933: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Will the new socio-economic system reproduce itself in the structure of the people's character? If so, how? Will his traits be inherited by his children? Will he be a free, self-regulating personality? Will the elements of freedom incorporated into the structure of the personality make any authoritarian forms of government unnecessary?&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Reich]], ''The Mass Psychology of Fascism'', Chapter 8, ''Masses and the State'' {{Page needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and philosopher [[Bernard Byhovsky]], Ph.D. writes: "The new man is endowed, first of all, with a new ethical outlook." &lt;ref&gt;Bernard Bykhovsky, ''The New Man in the Making'' (Moscow: Novosti Press Agency Publishing House) {{Page needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Man==
[[File:1988 CPA 6017.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'' commemorated in a Soviet stamp in [[Socialist realism|Socialist realist]] style.]]
The Soviet man was to be selfless, learned, healthy, muscular, and enthusiastic in spreading the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Proletarian revolution|Revolution]]. Adherence to [[Marxism-Leninism]], and individual behavior consistent with that philosophy's prescriptions, were among the crucial traits expected of the New Soviet man, which required intellectualism and hard discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. R. Myers]], ''The Cleanest Race'', p 81 {{ISBN|9781933633916}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not driven by crude impulses of nature but by conscious self-mastery, a belief that required the rejection of both innate personality and the unconscious, which Soviet psychologists therefore rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p258 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He treated public property with respect, as if it were his own.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.roca.org/OA/76-77/76f.htm 1917-1987: Unsuccessful and Tragic Attempt to Create a “New Man”]"&lt;/ref&gt;  He also has lost any nationalist sentiments, being Soviet rather than Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, or any of the many other nationalities found in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/soviet_union/su_glos.html Glossary -- Soviet Union]"&lt;/ref&gt;

His work required exertion and austerity, to show the new man triumphing over his base instincts.&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Myers, ''The Cleanest Race'', p 86 {{ISBN|9781933633916}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexey Stakhanov]]'s spurious&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/31/world/in-soviet-eager-beaver-s-legend-works-overtime.html |first=Serge |last=Schmemann |title=In Soviet, Eager Beaver's Legend Works Overtime |work=The New York Times |date=31 August 1985 |page=2 &lt;!-- section 1, column 3 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]], October 15, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; record-breaking day in mining coal caused him to be set forth as the exemplar of the "new man" and the members of [[Stakhanovite movement]]s tried to become Stakhanovites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy]], ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p258-9 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could also be a new woman; ''[[Pravda]]'' described the Soviet woman as someone who had and could never have existed before.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p259 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Female Stakhanovites were rarer than male, but a quarter of all trade-union women were designated as "norm-breaking."&lt;ref name="overy260"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p260 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the Paris World Fair, [[Vera Mukhina]] depicted a momentual sculpture, ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'', dressed in work clothing, pressing forward with his hammer and her sickle crossed.&lt;ref name="overy260"/&gt;

[[Aleksandr Zinovyev]] put forth the satirical argument that a new kind of person was indeed created by the Soviet system, but held that this new man - which they call ''[[Homo Sovieticus]]'' - was in many ways the opposite of the ideal of the New Soviet man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4760109.stm |title=Soviet-era satirist Zinovyev dies |publisher= BBC News|date= 2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selflessness===
Among the major traits of a new Soviet man was [[Altruism|selfless]] [[collectivism]].  The selfless new man was willing to sacrifice his life for good causes.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p301 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This trait was glorified from the first Soviet days, as exemplified by lines from the poem ''Vladimir Ilyich Lenin'' by the Soviet poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Who needs a "1"?
The voice of a "1"
:is thinner than a squeak.
Who will hear it?
:Only the wife...
A "1" is nonsense.
:A "1" is zero.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fictional characters and presentations of contemporary celebrities embodying this model were prominent features of Soviet [[culture|cultural]] life, especially at times when fostering the concept of the New Soviet man was given special priority by the government.

[[Pro-natalist]] policies encouraging women to have many children were justified by the selfishness inherent in limiting the next generation of "new men."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p257 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Soviet Woman==
[[File:SovietWoman1920.jpg|thumb|250px|"What the [[October Revolution]] gave to the female worker and peasant". 1920 Soviet propaganda poster. The inscriptions on the buildings read "library", "kindergarten", "school for grown-ups", etc.]]
In the 1920s and into the Stalinist era the concept of the "New Soviet Woman" served alongside that of the "New Soviet Man." Her roles were vastly different than that of her male counterpart; she was burdened with a complex identity that changed with ideology shifts in the party doctrine toward more [[conservative]] notions of the role of the family and the mother in the Soviet system. The New Soviet Woman was a Superwoman who balanced competing responsibilities and took on the burden of multiple roles: Communist citizen, full-time worker, wife and mother.&lt;ref name="BarbaraEvansC"&gt;Barbara Evans Clements, Daughters of the Revolution: A History of Women in the U.S.S.R. (Illinois: Harlan Davidson, Inc., 1994), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Soviet Person was generally characterized as male. In [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|Soviet propaganda]] centered on the New Soviet Person, it was standard for men to be depicted as the primary actors, either battling opponents of the Marxist revolution or rebuilding the world. Women, on the other hand, were often portrayed as "backward," passive beneficiaries of the revolution rather than its securers. This was so not least because the proletarian movement was organized and fought by the working class, which by and large consisted of men.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Thus, propaganda often equated male domination with proletariat domination. Although the party leadership claimed the sexes enjoyed equal status under the law, a significant accomplishment in itself, men remained the measure of worth.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

This marginalization of women in the newly developing civil order made it difficult for women to find a place among the proletarian class for which the revolution was fought. Regulations during the [[New Economic Policy]] period on the extent to which women could work in dangerous conditions, how many hours they could work in a shift and the kinds of special care they received during maternity made many factory owners reluctant to hire women, despite the Commissariat of Labor's requirements that women to be given equal access to employment.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were gains made in combating illiteracy and promoting education for women during the 1920s. Soviet policy encouraged working-class women to attend school and develop vocational skills. There existed opportunities for women to participate in politics, become party members and vie for elected and administrative positions. Access to the political sphere, however, was extremely limited.&lt;ref name="Gail Warshofsky Lapidus 1978"&gt;Gail Warshofsky Lapidus, Women in Soviet Society: Equality, Development, and Social Change (University of California Press, 1978), 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Stalin's policies on women were more conservative than that of his predecessor Lenin. Because he was concerned with a declining population rate, Stalin de-emphasized the Marxist feminist view of women in society, which, in his view, freed women from patriarchy and capitalism. In keeping with the party line, Stalin reasserted the importance of women in the workforce and female education, primarily literacy, although he began to emphasize the role of mother in a way that differed from more radical notions of the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="Gail Warshofsky Lapidus 1978"/&gt;

The "withering away" of the family was no longer a goal of economic and political progress. The new party line was that the family, like the state, was to grow stronger with the full realization of socialism. Massive propaganda campaigns linked the joys of motherhood with the benefits of Soviet power.&lt;ref name="Gail Warshofsky Lapidus 1978"/&gt; Soviet ideology began to argue that women's public roles were compatible with her roles as wife and mother. In fact, that the two reinforced one another and were both necessary for real womanhood.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Warshofsky Lapidus, Women in Soviet Society: Equality, Development, and Social Change (University of California Press, 1978), 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Soviet Woman differed greatly from the conceptions of revolutionaries preceding the 1930s. Instead of being freed from domestic concerns, she was bound to them. Though she now filled the role of man's peer in the workplace, she was also obligated to devote herself to being his helpmate in the home.&lt;ref name="BarbaraEvansC"/&gt; One of the primary roles of the New Soviet Woman was that of mother. This role became of great importance in the wake of population decline beginning in the 1920s. War and revolution had decimated the population. Legislation legalizing abortions and the increasing use of contraception—though still not that widespread—in the 1920s also contributed to the lower population numbers as women began to work more and give birth less.&lt;ref name="Barbara Alpern Engel 2004"&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a means to combat that trend, propaganda placed a new emphasis on the female's role as the perpetuator of the Communist regime in their ability to produce the next class of healthy workers, a policy called [[pronatalism]]. Propaganda presented pronatalism, a means to encourage women to bear children, in different ways to urban working-class women and to rural peasant women. Propaganda designed for an urban audience linked healthy female sexuality with reproduction while medical information to peasant women positioned conception as the purpose of sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Barbara Alpern Engel 2004"/&gt;

The new ideal Soviet woman appealed to many Soviet women. Many had found Marxist feminism difficult to swallow and preferred their traditional female roles.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Evans Clements, Daughters of the Revolution: A History of Women in the U.S.S.R. (Illinois: Harlan Davidson, Inc., 1994), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these women drew satisfaction from their role as mothers, they appreciated the opportunity afforded them by the Communist ideology to dismantle the oppression that often went hand-in-hand with domestic life.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} With husbands that often beat, abused, and abandoned them{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} and a society and government that looked down on them as intellectually and ideologically inferior prior to the Stalinist era{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, many women welcomed the ability to cast aside the stigma that came with their role as mother while retaining the status as an equal participant in society.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

During the 1920s and into the Stalinist era, Soviet policy forced women to curtail their professional aspirations in order to fulfill their dual role as worker and housewife. Competing requirements of family life limited female occupational mobility. Women managed the role strain experienced during the Stalinist era either by either a restriction of professional aspirations or by limiting family size. Despite pitfalls, unprecedented opportunities were available to lower-class women during this time. Women now had a voice in debates and the Zhenotdel, the women's section of the Central Committee from 1919–1930, made strides during its operation to increase political, social and economic agency of Soviet women.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1762">The '''Observatorio Venezolano de Prisiones''' '''(OVP,''' in English '''Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons)''' is a Venezuelan [[NGO]] working to improve [[human rights]] for prisoners. Its offices are located in [[Caracas]].
Several media have quoted the Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons: [[New York Times]] and [[Associated Press]].

== History ==
The OVP was founded in 2002. Among its members there are political scientists, criminologists, sociologists, architects and experts in the prison system.

The organisation was very vocal when in 2014 when 34 inmates at the Uribana prison died during protests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/12/01/venezuela-deaths-prison-protest HRW reports on Uribana]&lt;/ref&gt; This was in the wake of the [[2013 Uribana prison riot]] in which over 60 prisoners died.

The IACHR expressed concerns after government official [[Diosdado Cabello]] informed on his TV program Hitting with the Hammer when several representatives of the OVP were arriving in Venezuela after an international tour. The IACH considered Cabello was threatening them by notifying what were private details of a trip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2015/032.asp IACH expresses concerns for the safety of OVP representatives]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PETases''' are an [[esterase]] class of [[enzyme]]s that [[Catalysis|catalyze]] the [[hydrolysis]] of  poly (ethylene terephthalate) [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] plastic to [[monomer]]ic [[2-Hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid|mono-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate]] (MHET). The idealized chemical reaction is (where n is the number of [[monomer]]s in the [[polymer]] chain):&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

:(ethylene terephthalate)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → (ethylene terephthalate)&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; + MHET

Trace amount of the PET breaks down to [[Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl) terephthalate|bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate]] (BHET). PETases can also break down PEF-plastic ([[Polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate|polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate]]), which is a bioderived PET replacement.

== Chemical Reaction - PETase Hydrolysis ==
[[File:Plastic Breakdown by PETase.png|thumb|Plastic breakdown by PETase &lt;ref&gt;Figure 2. Chan, Allison (2016). "The Future of Bacteria Cleaning Our Plastic Waste." https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7xb0c7hr/qt7xb0c7hr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]
PETase hydrolyses PET (polyethylene terephthalate) into soluble building blocks due to reaction with water which is a bioconversion of plastics. &lt;ref&gt;Chan, Allison (2016). "The Future of Bacteria Cleaning Our Plastic Waste". https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7xb0c7hr/qt7xb0c7hr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; PET is a polymer composed of ester bond-linked terephthalate (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). A high molecular weight and other properties make PET a great utilizing plastic. By the hydrolysis reaction PET hydrolyzing enzymes decompose PET into building blocks which is helpful for the environment. During the hydrolyzing PET, the enzyme produces mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), TPA ,and bis-2(hydroxyethyl) TPA (BHET). &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The novel bacteria called ''Ideonella sakaieensis'' is isolating and it utilize PET as an energy and carbon source. The ''deonella sakaieensis'' sticks to the surface of PET  and keep a cutinase enzyme that allow PET to degrade. That reaction allows to degrade PET, and make it less harmful for the environment. 

==MHET breakdown in ''I. sakaiensis''==
MHET is broken down in ''I. sakaiensis'' by the action of [[MHETase]] enzyme to [[terephthalic acid]] and [[ethylene glycol]]. These are environmentally harmless as they are broken down further to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and water.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshida S, Hiraga K, Takehana T, Taniguchi I, Yamaji H, Maeda Y, Toyohara K, Miyamoto K, Kimura Y, Oda K | title = A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly(ethylene terephthalate) | journal = Science | volume = 351 | issue = 6278 | pages = 1196–9 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26965627 | doi = 10.1126/science.aad6359 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6278/1196.long | lay-url = https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/press_releases/2016/cb96u90000005501-att/160330_2.pdf | lay-date = 2016-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''I. sakaiensis'' bacterium  adhere to the PET surface and release a unique enzyme, similar to cutinase, with the ability to degrade PET.

==Mutations==

In 2018 scientists from the University of Portsmouth with the collaboration of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the United States Department of Energy developed a mutant of this PETase that degrades PET faster than the one in its natural state. In this study it was also shown that PETases can degrade [[polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate]] (PEF).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Classifications of PETase-like enzymes.jpg|thumb|Figure A. Classification of PETase-like enzymes.  Figure B. A comparison of residues between two type II sub-classes and type I class of PETase-like enzymes. &lt;ref&gt;Figure 2. Chan, Allison (2016). "The Future of Bacteria Cleaning Our Plastic Waste." https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7xb0c7hr/qt7xb0c7hr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are approximately 69 PETase-like enzymes comprising a variety of diverse organisms, and there are two classifications of these enzymes including type I and type II. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is suggested that 57 enzymes fall into the type I category whereas the rest fall into the type II group, including the PETase enzyme found in the ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]].'' Within all 69 PETase-like enzymes, there exists the same three residues within the active site, suggesting that the catalytic mechanism is the same in all forms of PETase-like enzymes.

[[Image:Penrose-dreieck.svg|thumb|192px|Penrose triangle]]
[[File:Penrose-triangle-4color-rotation.gif|thumb|A rotating penrose triangle model to show illusion]]
The '''Penrose triangle''', also known as the '''Penrose tribar,''' or the '''impossible tribar''',&lt;ref&gt;Pappas, T. "The Impossible Tribar." The Joy of Mathematics. San Carlos, CA: Wide World Publ./Tetra, p. 13, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; is a triangular [[impossible object]]. It was first created by the Swedish artist [[Oscar Reutersvärd]] in 1934. The psychiatrist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his [[mathematician]] son [[Roger Penrose]] independently devised and popularized it in the 1950s, describing it as "impossibility in its purest form". It is featured prominently in the works of artist [[M. C. Escher]], whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it.

==Impossible object==
The tribar appears to be a [[solid]] object, made of three straight beams of square cross-section which meet pairwise at right angles at the vertices of the [[triangle]] they form. The beams may be broken, forming cubes or cuboids.

[[File:Perth Impossible Triangle.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Impossible triangle sculpture as an [[optical illusion]], East Perth, Western Australia]]
This combination of properties cannot be realized by any three-dimensional object in ordinary [[Euclidean space]].  Such an object can exist in certain Euclidean [[3-manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Francis|first=George|title=A topological picturebook|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=1988|ISBN=0-387-96426-6}}  In the chapter on the Penrose tribar, Francis attributes this observation to [[John Stillwell]].&lt;/ref&gt;  There also exist three-dimensional solid shapes each of which, when viewed from a certain angle, appears the same as the 2-dimensional depiction of the Penrose triangle on this page (such as – for example – the adjacent image depicting a sculpture in [[Perth]], [[Australia]]).  The term "Penrose triangle" can refer to the 2-dimensional depiction or the impossible object itself.

[[M.C. Escher]]'s [[lithograph]] ''[[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]'' (1961) depicts a watercourse that flows in a zigzag along the long sides of two elongated Penrose triangles, so that it ends up two stories higher than it began. The resulting waterfall, forming the short sides of both triangles, drives a [[water wheel]]. Escher helpfully points out that in order to keep the wheel turning some water must occasionally be added to compensate for [[evaporation]].

[[File:Penrosetrianglemodel.jpg|thumb|A 3D-printed version of the Reutersvard Triangle illusion]]
[[Image:LargeTribarGotschuchenAustria.JPG|thumb|200px|Impossible Triangle sculpture, Gotschuchen, Austria]]
If a line is traced around the Penrose triangle, a 4-loop [[Möbius strip]] is formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=Mathematical Games, August 1978 A Möbius band has a finite thickness, and so it is actually a twisted prism|publisher=SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, A DIVISION OF NATURE AMERICA, INC.|year=1978|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although the tribar is named one of the impossible objects, there exist many more that fit into the same category. Other impossible objects include the [[impossible trident|devil's fork]], the [http://brainden.com/images/elephant-big.gif dancing elephant], and [http://brainden.com/images/impossible-arch-big.jpg impossible arch].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BrainDen.com – Impossible Objects|url = http://brainden.com/impossible-objects.htm|website = BrainDen.com|access-date = 2016-02-09|first = Jan|last = Adamovic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Penrose polygons==
While it is possible to construct analogies to the Penrose triangle with other shapes and regular polygons to create a Penrose polygon, the visual effect is not as striking, and as the sides increase, the object seems merely to be warped or twisted.

'''Resocialization''' is the process by which one's sense of social values, beliefs, and norms are re-engineered. This process is deliberately carried out in a variety of settings such as in many single parent households and military boot-camps, through an intense social process that may take place in a [[total institution]]. An important thing to note about socialization is that what can be learned, can be unlearned. This forms the basis of resocialization: to unlearn and relearn.

Resocialization can also be defined{{by whom?|date=December 2016}} as a process wherein individuals, defined as inadequate according to the norms of a dominant institution, are subjected to a dynamic redistribution of those values, attitudes and abilities which would allow them to function according to the norms of said dominant institutions. This definition relates more to a [[jail]] sentence. If individuals exhibit deviance, society delivers the offenders to a total institution where they can be rehabilitated.

Resocialization varies in its severity. A mild resocialization might be involved in moving to a different country. One who does this may need to learn new social customs and norms such as language, eating habits, dress, and talking habits. A more drastic example of resocialization is joining a military or a [[cult]], and the most severe example would be if one suffers from a loss of all memories and therefore would have to relearn society's norms over again.

The first stage of resocialization is the destruction of an individual's former beliefs and confidence.

==Resocialization institutions==
[[Image:A Look At The Life Of Prison.jpg|thumb|A prison cell]]
A total institution refers to an institution in which one is totally immersed and that controls all the day-to-day life. All activity will occur in  a single place under a single authority. Examples of a total institution can include prisons, fraternity houses, and the military.

The goal of [[total institution]]s is resocialization which radically alters residents' personalities through deliberate manipulation of their environment. Resocialization is a two-part process. First, the institutional staff try to erode the residents' identities and independence.

Strategies to erode identities include forcing individuals to surrender all personal possessions, get uniform haircuts and wear standardized clothing. Independence is eroded by subjecting residents to humiliating and degrading procedures. Examples are strip searches, fingerprinting and assigning serial numbers or code names to replace the residents' given names.

The second part of resocialization process involves the systematic attempt to build a different personality or self. This is generally done through a system of rewards and punishments. The privilege of being allowed to read a book, watch television or make a phone call can be a powerful motivator for conformity. Conformity occurs when individuals change their behaviour to fit in with the expectations of an authority figure or the expectations of the larger group.

No two people respond to resocialization programs in the same manner. While some residents are found to be "rehabilitated", others might become bitter and hostile. As well, over a long period of time, a strictly controlled environment can destroy a person's ability to make decisions and live independently. This is known as [[institutionalisation (psychology)|institutionalisation]], a negative outcome of total institution that prevents an individual from ever functioning effectively in the outside world again. (Sproule, 154-155)

Resocialization is also evident in individuals who have never been "[[socialization|socialized]]" in the first place, or who have not been required to behave socially for an extended period of time. Examples include [[feral children]] (never socialized) or inmates who have been in [[solitary confinement]].

Socialization is a lifelong process. Adult socialization often includes learning new norms and values that are very different from those associated with the culture in which the person was raised. This process can be voluntary. Currently, joining a [[volunteer military]] qualifies as an example of voluntary resocialization. The norms and values associated with military life are different from those associated with civilian life. (Riehm, 2000)

Sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] studied resocialization in mental institutions. He characterized the mental institution as a total institution—one in which virtually every aspect of the inmates’ lives was controlled by the institution and calculated to serve the institution's goals. For example, the institution requires that patients comply with certain regulations, even when compliance is not necessarily in the best interest of the individual.

== Resocializing in the military ==
Once a person joins the military they enter a new social realm where they become socialized as a military member. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunivin|first1=Karen|title=Military Culture: Change and Continuity|journal=Armed Forces and Society|date=1994|volume=20|issue=4|page=531-547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradley|first1=Christopher|title=Veteran Status and Marital Aggression: Does Military Service Make a Difference?.|journal=Journal of Family Violence|date=2007|volume=22|issue=4|page=197-209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resocialization is defined as a “process wherein an individual, defined as inadequate according to the norms of a dominant institution(s), is subjected to a dynamic program of behavior intervention aimed at instilling and/or rejuvenating those values, attitudes, and abilities which would allow…[her] to function according to the norms of said dominant institution(s).” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbert|first1=Melissa S.|title=From Crinoline to Camouflage: Initial Entry Training and The Marginalization of Women in The Military|journal=Minerva|date=1993|volume=11|issue=1|page=1-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boot camp serves as an example for understanding how military members are resocialized within the total institution of the military. According to Fox and Pease (2012) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John|last2=Pease|first2=Bob|title=Military Deployment, Masculinity and Trauma: Reviewing the Connections|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2012|volume=20|issue=1|page=16-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the purpose of military training, like boot camp, is to “promote the willing and systematic subordination of one’s own individual desires and interests to those of one’s unit and, ultimately, country." To accomplish this, all aspects of military members’ lives exist within the same military institution, are controlled by the same “institutional authorities” (drill instructors) and are done to accomplish the goals of the total institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbert|first1=Melissa S.|title=From Crinoline to Camouflage: Initial Entry Training and The Marginalization of Women in The Military|journal=Minerva|date=1993|volume=11|issue=1|page=1-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual’s “civil[ian] identity, with its built-in restraints is eradicated, or at least undermined and set aside in favor of the warrior identity and its central focus upon killing." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbert|first1=Melissa S.|title=From Crinoline to Camouflage: Initial Entry Training and The Marginalization of Women in The Military|journal=Minerva|date=1993|volume=11|issue=1|page=1-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military training prepares individuals for combat by promoting traditional ideas of masculinity, like training individuals to disregard their bodies’ natural reactions to run from fear, have pain or show emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John|last2=Pease|first2=Bob|title=Military Deployment, Masculinity and Trauma: Reviewing the Connections|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2012|volume=20|issue=1|page=16-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although resocialization through military training can create a sense of purpose in military members, it also has the likelihood to create mental and emotional distress when members are unable to achieve set standards and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John|last2=Pease|first2=Bob|title=Military Deployment, Masculinity and Trauma: Reviewing the Connections|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2012|volume=20|issue=1|page=16-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military members, in part, find purpose and meaning through resocialization, because the institution provides access to symbolic and material resources, helping military members construct meaningful identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinojosa|first1=Ramon|title=Doing Hegemony: Military, Men, and Constructing a Hegemonic Masculinity|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2010|volume=18|issue=2|page=179-194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox and Pease &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John|last2=Pease|first2=Bob|title=Military Deployment, Masculinity and Trauma: Reviewing the Connections|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2012|volume=20|issue=1|page=16-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; state, “like any social identity, military identity is always an achievement, something dependent upon conformity to others’ expectations and their acknowledgment. The centrality of performance testing in the military, and the need to ‘measure up,’ heightens this dependence. Although resocialization through military training can create a sense of purpose in military members, it also has the likelihood to create mental and emotional distress when members are unable to achieve set standards and expectations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John|last2=Pease|first2=Bob|title=Military Deployment, Masculinity and Trauma: Reviewing the Connections|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2012|volume=20|issue=1|page=16-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first couple of days, the most important aspect of basic training is the surrender of their identity. Recruits shed their clothes and hair which are the physical representation of their old identities. These processes happen very quickly and allows no time for recruits to think over the loss of their identity, this is so the recruits don’t have a chance to regret their decisions.

The drill sergeants then give the young men and women a romanticized view on what it is to be a soldier, and how manly it is. When the training starts it is physically demanding and gets harder every week. The recruits are constantly insulted and put down; this breaks down their pride and destroys their ability to resist the change they are undergoing. The drill sergeants put up a facade that tells their recruits that finishing out basic training sets them apart from all of the others who will fail. However, almost all recruits will succeed and graduate from basic training.

The training is also set up with roles. There are three younger drill sergeants closer to the recruits in age and one senior drill sergeant who becomes a father figure to the new recruits. And the company commander plays a god-like role, that the recruits look up to. The people in these roles will become role models and authority figures, but will also help create a sense of loyalty to the entire organization.

Recruits are made to march in a formation where every person is moving the same way at the same time causes a sense of unity. It makes the recruits feel less like an individual and more like they are a part of a group. They sing in cadence to boost morale and to make the group feel important. The drill sergeants also feed the group small doses of triumphs which keep the soldiers proud and feeling accomplished.

The troop also undergoes group punishment which unifies the unit. Generally the similar hatred of something will bring everyone together. In this case, group punishment allows all the recruits to hate the drill sergeants and the punishment but find unity within their unit. They will encourage others to push themselves and create shared hardships.

== Resocializing in prisons ==
Prisons have two different types of resocialization. The first type is when the prisoner has to learn the new normal behaviors that apply to their new environment. The second type is if the prisoner has to partake in rehabilitation measures to help fix their deviant ways. When the individual violates the dominant society’s norms, the criminology system subjects them to a form of resocialization called criminal rehabilitation.

Rehabilitation aims to bring an inmate's real behavior closer to that of the majority of the individuals' behaviour that make up the dominant society. This 'ideal' societal behaviour is highly valued in many societies, mainly because it serves to protect and promote the well being of the majority of that society's members. In rehabilitation, the system will strip the criminal of his prior socialization of criminal behavior including the techniques of committing a crime and the specific motives, drives, rationalizations and attitudes. Criminal behavior is learned behavior and can therefore be unlearned.

The first step towards rehabilitation is the choice of Milieu. This is the type of interactions the deviant will have with the people around him while in custody. Usually this is determined after psychological and sociological screenings are performed on the criminal. The second step is Diagnosis. The diagnosis is a continual process influenced by feedback from the individual’s behavior. The next stage is treatment. Treatment is dependent on the diagnosis. Whether it is treating an addiction or redefining the values of a person, the treatment is what will resocialize the criminal back to societal norms.

'''Scientific modelling''' is a scientific activity, the aim of which is to make a particular part or feature of the world easier to [[Understanding|understand]], [[Definition|define]], [[quantification (science)|quantify]], [[Visual system|visualize]], or [[Simulation|simulate]] by referencing it to existing and usually commonly accepted [[knowledge]]. It requires selecting and identifying relevant aspects of a situation in the real world and then using different types of models for different aims, such as [[conceptual model]]s to better understand, operational models to [[operational definition|operationalize]], [[mathematical model]]s to quantify, and [[graphical model]]s to visualize the subject. Modelling is an essential and inseparable part of many scientific disciplines, each of which have their own ideas about specific types of modelling.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, Nancy. 1983.

Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an increasing attention to scientific modelling&lt;ref&gt;Frigg and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann]] (2009) state: "Philosophers are acknowledging the importance of models with increasing attention and are probing the assorted roles that models play in scientific practice". Source: Frigg, Roman and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann, Stephan]], "Models in Science", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), ([http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/models-science/ source])&lt;/ref&gt; in fields such as [[science education]], [[philosophy of science]], [[systems theory]], and [[Visualization (graphics)#Knowledge visualization|knowledge visualization]]. There is growing collection of [[Scientific method|methods]], techniques and meta-[[theory]] about all kinds of specialized scientific modelling.

== Overview ==
[[File:MathModel.svg|right]]
A scientific model seeks to represent [[empiricism|empirical]] objects, phenomena, and physical processes in a [[logic]]al and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] way. All models are ''in simulacra'', that is, simplified reflections of reality that, despite being approximations, can be extremely useful.&lt;ref&gt;Box, George E.P. &amp; Draper, N.R. (1987). [Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces.] ''Wiley''. p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; Building and disputing models is fundamental to the scientific enterprise. Complete and true representation may be impossible, but scientific debate often concerns which is the better model for a given task, e.g., which is the more accurate climate model for seasonal forecasting.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, R. ''et al.'' (2005) [http://www.ecmwf.int/staff/paco_doblas/abstr/tellus05_1.pdf, http://www.ecmwf.int/staff/paco_doblas/abstr/tellus05_1.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Tellus'' 57A:219–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to [[formal language|formalize]] the [[laws of science|principle]]s of the [[empirical science]]s use an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] to model reality, in the same way logicians [[axiomatic system|axiomatize]] the [[rule of inference|principle]]s of [[logic]]. The aim of these attempts is to construct a [[formal system]] that will not produce theoretical consequences that are contrary to what is found in [[reality]]. Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true.&lt;ref name="tcarotmimanass"&gt;[[Leo Apostel]] (1961). "Formal study of models". In: ''The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social''. Edited by [[Hans Freudenthal]]. Springer. pp. 8–9 ([https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=8083fb2EuAMC&amp;dq=The+Concept+and+the+Role+of+the+Model+in+Mathematics+and+Natural+and+Social+Sciences&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bF9aEC4e6L&amp;sig=iduhMF0ektNGV87_ZkwuY5thw0U#PPA8,M1 Source])]'',&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritchey, T.  (2012) [http://www.amg.swemorph.com/pdf/amg-1-1-2012.pdf Outline for a Morphology of Modelling Methods: Contribution to a General Theory of Modelling]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the scientist, a model is also a way in which the human thought processes can be amplified.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. West Churchman]], ''The Systems Approach'', New York: Dell publishing, 1968, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, models that are rendered in software allow scientists to leverage computational power to simulate, visualize, manipulate and gain intuition about the entity, phenomenon, or process being represented. Such computer models are ''in silico''. Other types of scientific models are ''in vivo'' (living models, such as [[laboratory rat]]s) and ''in vitro'' (in glassware, such as [[tissue culture]]).&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, E. C. (2010) [https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/emily-griffiths/whatisamodel.pdf What is a model?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basics of scientific modelling ==

===Modelling as a substitute for direct measurement and experimentation===
Models are typically used when it is either impossible or impractical to create experimental conditions in which scientists can directly measure outcomes. Direct measurement of outcomes under [[Scientific control|controlled conditions]] (see [[Scientific method]]) will always be more reliable than modelled estimates of outcomes.

Within [[Modeling and simulation|modelling and simulation]], a model is a task-driven, purposeful simplification and abstraction of a perception of reality, shaped by physical, legal, and cognitive constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, A. (2015). Learning something right from models that are wrong – Epistemology of Simulation. In Yilmaz, L. (Ed.) ''Concepts and Methodologies in Modeling and Simulation.'' Springer–Verlag. pp. 87–106&lt;/ref&gt; It is task-driven, because a model is captured with a certain question or task in mind. Simplifications leave all the known and observed entities and their relation out that are not important for the task. Abstraction aggregates information that is important, but not needed in the same detail as the object of interest. Both activities, simplification and abstraction, are done purposefully. However, they are done based on a perception of reality. This perception is already a ''model'' in itself, as it comes with a physical constraint. There are also constraints on what we are able to legally observe with our current tools and methods, and cognitive constraints which limit what we are able to explain with our current theories. This model comprises the concepts, their behavior, and their relations in formal form and is often referred to as a [[conceptual model]]. In order to execute the model, it needs to be implemented as a [[computer simulation]]. This requires more choices, such as numerical approximations or the use of heuristics.&lt;ref&gt;Oberkampf, W. L., DeLand, S. M., Rutherford, B. M., Diegert, K. V., &amp; Alvin, K. F. (2002). Error and uncertainty in modeling and simulation. ''Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety'' 75(3): 333–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all these epistemological and computational constraints, simulation has been recognized as the third pillar of scientific methods: theory building, simulation, and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Ihrig, M. (2012). A New Research Architecture For The Simulation Era. In ''European Council on Modelling and Simulation''. pp. 715–20).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simulation===
A [[simulation]] is the implementation of a model.  A steady state simulation provides information about the system at a specific instant in time (usually at equilibrium, if such a state exists).  A dynamic simulation provides information over time. A simulation brings a model to life and shows how a particular object or phenomenon will behave. Such a simulation can be useful for testing, analysis, or training in those cases where real-world systems or concepts can be represented by models.&lt;ref name="SEF"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
[[Structure]] is a fundamental and sometimes intangible notion covering the recognition, observation, nature, and stability of patterns and relationships of entities. From a child's verbal description of a snowflake, to the detailed [[scientific analysis]] of the properties of [[magnetic field]]s, the concept of structure is an essential foundation of nearly every mode of inquiry and discovery in science, philosophy, and art.&lt;ref name="Pullan000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pullan | first = Wendy | title = Structure | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-521-78258-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems===
A [[system]] is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. In general, a system is a construct or collection of different elements that together can produce results not obtainable by the elements alone.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick PA. (1995). Simulation Model Design and Execution: Building Digital Worlds. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of an 'integrated whole' can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships which are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime.  There are two types of system models: 1) discrete in which the variables change instantaneously at separate points in time and, 2) continuous where the state variables change continuously with respect to time.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, J.A., Banks, C.M.(2009). Principles of Modelling and Simulation. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generating a model===
Modelling is the process of generating a model as a conceptual representation of some phenomenon. Typically a model will deal with only some aspects of the phenomenon in question, and two models of the same phenomenon may be essentially different—that is to say, that the differences between them comprise more than just a simple renaming of components.

Such differences may be due to differing requirements of the model's end users, or to conceptual or aesthetic differences among the modellers and to contingent decisions made during the modelling process. Considerations that may influence the [[structure]] of a model might be the modeller's preference for a reduced [[ontology]], preferences regarding [[statistical model]]s versus [[Deterministic system|deterministic models]], discrete versus continuous time, etc. In any case, users of a model need to understand the assumptions made that are pertinent to its validity for a given use.

Building a model requires [[abstraction]].  Assumptions are used in modelling in order to specify the domain of application of the model. For example, the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] assumes an [[inertial frame of reference]]. This assumption was contextualized and further explained by the [[general theory of relativity]]. A model makes accurate predictions when its assumptions are valid, and might well not make accurate predictions when its assumptions do not hold. Such assumptions are often the point with which older theories are succeeded by new ones (the [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]] works in non-inertial reference frames as well).

The term "assumption" is actually broader than its standard use, etymologically speaking. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) and online Wiktionary indicate its Latin source as ''assumere'' ("accept, to take to oneself, adopt, usurp"), which is a conjunction of ''ad-'' ("to, towards, at") and ''sumere'' (to take). The root survives, with shifted meanings, in the Italian ''sumere'' and Spanish ''sumir''.  In the OED, "assume" has the senses of (i) “investing oneself with (an attribute), ” (ii) “to undertake” (especially in Law), (iii) “to take to oneself in appearance only, to pretend to possess,” and (iv) “to suppose a thing to be.” Thus, "assumption" connotes other associations than the contemporary standard sense of “that which is assumed or taken for granted; a supposition, postulate,” and deserves a broader analysis in the philosophy of science.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Evaluating a model===
{{See also|Models of scientific inquiry#Choice of a theory}}
A model is evaluated first and foremost by its consistency to empirical data; any model inconsistent with reproducible observations must be modified or rejected. One way to modify the model is by restricting the domain over which it is credited with having high validity. A case in point is Newtonian physics, which is highly useful except for the very small, the very fast, and the very massive phenomena of the universe. However, a fit to empirical data alone is not sufficient for a model to be accepted as valid.  Other factors important in evaluating a model include:{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
* Ability to explain past observations
* Ability to predict future observations
* Cost of use, especially in combination with other models
* Refutability, enabling estimation of the degree of confidence in the model
* Simplicity, or even aesthetic appeal
People may attempt to quantify the evaluation of a model using a [[utility function]].

===Visualization===
[[Visualization (computer graphics)|Visualization]] is any technique for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate a message. Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of man. Examples from history include [[cave painting]]s, [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], Greek [[geometry]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s revolutionary methods of technical drawing for engineering and scientific purposes.

===Space mapping===
[[Space mapping]] refers to a methodology that employs a "quasi-global" modeling formulation to link companion "coarse" (ideal or low-fidelity) with "fine" (practical or high-fidelity) models of different complexities. In [[engineering optimization]], space mapping aligns (maps) a very fast coarse model with its related expensive-to-compute fine model so as to avoid direct expensive optimization of the fine model. The alignment process iteratively refines a "mapped" coarse model ([[surrogate model]]).

== Applications ==
===Modelling and simulation===

One application of scientific modelling is the field of [[modelling and simulation]], generally referred to as "M&amp;S".  M&amp;S has a spectrum of applications which range from concept development and analysis, through experimentation, measurement and verification, to disposal analysis.  Projects and programs may use hundreds of different simulations, simulators and model analysis tools.

=== Model-based learning in education ===
[[File:Flowchart MBR.png|center|Flowchart Describing One Style of Model-based Learning]]

Model–based learning in education, particularly in relation to learning science involves students creating models for scientific concepts in order to:&lt;ref name=cambridgeref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lehrer|first1=Richard|last2=Schauble|first2=Leona|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Learning Sciences|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-84554-0|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gain insight of the scientific idea(s)
* Acquire deeper understanding of the subject through visualization of the model
* Improve student engagement in the course

Different types of model based learning techniques include:&lt;ref name=cambridgeref /&gt;
* Physical macrocosms
* Representational systems
* Syntactic models
* Emergent models

Model–making in education is an iterative exercise with students refining, developing and evaluating their models over time. This shifts learning from the rigidity and monotony of traditional curriculum to an exercise of students' creativity and curiosity. This approach utilizes the constructive strategy of social collaboration and learning scaffold theory. Model based learning includes cognitive reasoning skills where existing models can be improved upon by construction of newer models using the old models as a basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J|title=The Cognitive Basis of Science|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-01177-9|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Model–based learning entails determining target models and a learning pathway that provide realistic chances of understanding." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clement|first1=JJ|last2=Rea-Ramirez|first2=Mary Anne|title=Model Based Learning and Instruction in Science|date=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-6493-7|page=45|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model making can also incorporate [[blended learning]] strategies by using web based tools and simulators, thereby allowing students to:
* Familiarize themselves with on-line or digital resources
* Create different models with various virtual materials at little or no cost
* Practice model making activity any time and any place

"A well-designed simulation simplifies a real world system while heightening awareness of the complexity of the system. Students can participate in the simplified system and learn how the real system operates without spending days, weeks or years it would take to undergo this experience in the real world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blumschein|first1=Patrick|last2=Hung|first2=Woei|last3=Jonassen|first3=David|last4=Strobel|first4=Johannes|title=Model-Based Approaches to Learning|date=2009|publisher=Sense Publishers|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-90-8790-711-2|url=https://www.sensepublishers.com/media/659-model-based-approaches-to-learning.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teacher's role in the overall teaching and learning process is primarily that of a [[facilitator]] and arranger of the learning experience. He or she would assign the students, a model making activity for a particular concept and provide relevant information or support for the activity. For virtual model making activities, the teacher can also provide information on the usage of the digital tool and render troubleshooting support in case of glitches while using the same. The teacher can also arrange the group discussion activity between the students and provide the platform necessary for students to share their observations and knowledge extracted from the model making activity.

Model–based learning evaluation could include the use of [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]] that assess the ingenuity and creativity of the student in the model construction and also the overall classroom participation of the student vis-a-vis the knowledge constructed through the activity.

It is important, however, to give due consideration to the following for successful model–based learning to occur:
* Use of the right tool at the right time for a particular concept
* Provision within the educational setup for model–making activity: e.g., computer room with internet facility or software installed to access simulator or digital tool

== Secret law in the United States ==

Since about 2015 the branches of the United States federal government have accused one another of creating secret law.  Journalists, scholars, and anti-secrecy activists have also made similar allegations.  Scholarly analysis has shown that secret law is present in all three branches.  One scholar, Professor Dakota Rudesill, recommends that the country affirmatively decide whether to tolerate secret law, and proposes principles for governing it, including: public law’s supremacy over secret law; no secret criminal law; public notification of creation of secret law; presumptive sunset and publication dates; and availability of all secret law to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudesill|first1=Dakota|title=Coming to Terms With Secret Law|journal=Harvard National Security Journal|date=2015|volume=7|issue=1|pages=241–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =The new era secret law | work = | date =18 October 2016 | url = https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/new-era-secret-law| accessdate = 15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secret regulations in UK public places==
In Britain many open places freely accessible by the public are actually [[privately owned public space]]s (POPS). Information on ownership is considered confidential, and not provided either by the owners, or by [[Local government in England|local councils]] that have the information. As in any private property the owner may require visitors to abide by specified rules; but people freely accessing the place are not informed of the rules, which may nevertheless be enforced by security guards. Typical prohibitions which do not apply to genuinely public spaces include protesting, and photography.

Councils mostly refused to provide information on existing and planned pseudo-public spaces. They also refused to say how information could be obtained, or to provide information on private restrictions on exercising the other rights people have on genuinely public land. Councils were criticised for being under the influence of property developers and corporate owners. A member of the London Assembly said "Being able to know what rules you are being governed by, and how to challenge them, is a fundamental part of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/sep/26/its-really-shocking-uk-cities-refusing-to-reveal-extent-of-pseudo-public-space#comment-105829422 |title='It's really shocking': UK cities refusing to reveal extent of pseudo-public space |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 September 2017  |author= |accessdate= 26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''state diagram''' is a type of [[diagram]] used in [[computer science]] and related fields to describe the behavior of systems. State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of [[state (computer science)|state]]s; sometimes, this is indeed the case, while at other times this is a reasonable [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]]. Many forms of state diagrams exist, which differ slightly and have different [[Semantics#Computer science|semantics]].

== Overview ==
State diagrams are used to give an abstract description of the [[behavior]] of a [[system]]. This behavior is analyzed and represented as a series of events that can occur in one or more possible states. Hereby "each diagram usually represents objects of a single class and track the different states of its objects through the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://atlas.kennesaw.edu/~dbraun/csis4650/A&amp;D/UML_tutorial/state.htm |date=* }}&lt;/ref&gt;

State diagrams can be used to graphically represent [[finite state machine]]s. This was introduced by [[C.E. Shannon]] and [[W. Weaver]] in their 1949 book "The Mathematical Theory of Communication". Another source is [[Taylor Booth]] in his 1967 book "Sequential Machines and Automata Theory". Another possible representation is the [[State transition table]].

== Directed graph ==

[[Image:Directed.svg|125px|thumb|A [[directed graph]]]]

A classic form of state diagram for a [[finite state machine]] or [[finite automaton]] (FA) is a [[directed graph]] with the following elements (Q,Σ,Z,δ,q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,F):&lt;ref name=Boo67&gt;[[Taylor Booth]] (1967) ''Sequential Machines and Automata Theory'', John Wiley and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HoU79&gt;[[John Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] (1979) ''[[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]]'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading Mass, {{ISBN|0-201-02988-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Vertices Q''': a finite set of states, normally represented by circles and labeled with unique designator symbols or words written inside them
*'''Input symbols Σ''': a finite collection of input symbols or designators
*'''Output symbols Z''': a finite collection of output symbols or designators

The output function ω represents the mapping of ordered pairs of input symbols and states onto output symbols, denoted mathematically as '''ω''' : '''Σ''' × '''Q'''→ '''Z'''.

*'''Edges δ''': represent transitions from one state to another as caused by the input (identified by their symbols drawn on the edges). An edge is usually drawn as an arrow directed from the present state to the next state. This mapping describes the state transition that is to occur on input of a particular symbol. This is written mathematically as '''δ''' : '''Q''' × '''Σ''' →   '''Q''', so δ (the transition function) in the definition of the FA is given by both the pair of vertices connected by an edge and the symbol on an edge in a diagram representing this FA. Item '''δ(q,a)= p''' in the definition of the FA means that from the state named '''q'''  under input symbol '''a''', the transition to the state '''p''' occurs in this machine. In the diagram representing this FA, this is represented by an edge labeled by '''a''' pointing from the vertex labeled by '''q''' to the vertex labeled by '''p'''.
*'''Start state q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''': (not shown in the examples below). The start state q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ Q is usually represented by an arrow with no origin pointing to the state. In older texts,&lt;ref name=Boo67/&gt;&lt;ref name=McC65&gt;[[Edward J. McClusky]], Introduction to the Theory of Switching Circuits, McGraw-Hill, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; the start state is not shown and must be inferred from the text.
*'''Accepting state(s) F''': If used, for example for accepting automata, F ∈ Q is the [[accept state|accepting state]]. It is usually drawn as a double circle. Sometimes the accept state(s) function as "'''F'''inal" (halt, trapped) states.&lt;ref name=HoU79/&gt;

For a [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA), [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA), [[generalized nondeterministic finite automaton]] (GNFA), or [[Moore machine]], the input is denoted on each edge. For a [[Mealy machine]], input and output are signified on each edge, separated with a slash "/": "1/0" denotes the state change upon encountering the symbol "1" causing the symbol "0" to be output. For a [[Moore machine]] the state's output is usually written inside the state's circle, also separated from the state's designator with a slash "/". There are also variants that combine these two notations.

For example, if a state has a number of outputs (e.g. "a= motor counter-clockwise=1, b= caution light inactive=0") the diagram should reflect this : e.g. "q5/1,0" designates state q5 with outputs a=1, b=0. This designator will be written inside the state's circle.

=== Example: DFA, NFA, GNFA, or [[Moore machine]] ===
''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are states and ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an '''accepting state''' or a '''final state'''.  Each edge is labeled with the input. This example shows an acceptor for strings over {0,1} that contain an even number of zeros.
:[[Image:DFAexample.svg|200px|DFAexample.svg]]

=== Example: [[Mealy machine]] ===
''S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are states.  Each edge is labeled with "''j'' / ''k''" where ''j'' is the input and ''k'' is the output.

== Harel statechart ==
[[File:OO Modeling languages history.jpg|thumb|250px|Diagram showing how Harel's Statecharts contributed to object-oriented methods and notation]]
[[David Harel|Harel]] [[statechart]]s&lt;ref name=Har87&gt;[[David Harel]], [http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/SCANNED.PAPERS/Statecharts.pdf  Statecharts: A visual formalism for complex systems. Science of Computer Programming], 8(3):231–274, June 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; are gaining widespread usage since a variant has  become part of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML).{{primary inline|date=March 2018}} The diagram type allows the modeling of [[UML state machine#Hierarchically nested states|superstates]], [[UML state machine#Orthogonal regions|orthogonal regions]], and activities as part of a state.

Classic state diagrams require the creation of distinct nodes for every valid combination of parameters that define the state.  This can lead to a very large number of nodes and transitions between nodes for all but the simplest of systems ([[UML state machine#UML extensions to the traditional FSM formalism|state and transition explosion]]). This complexity reduces the readability of the state diagram. With Harel statecharts it is possible to model multiple cross-functional state diagrams within the statechart.  Each of these cross-functional state machines can transition internally without affecting the other state machines in the statechart.  The current state of each cross-functional state machine in the statechart defines the state of the system.  The Harel statechart is equivalent to a state diagram but it improves the readability of the resulting diagram.

==Alternative semantics==
There are other sets of semantics available to represent state diagrams.  For example, there are tools for modeling and designing logic for embedded controllers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csl.sri.com/users/tiwari/papers/stateflow.pdf Tiwari, A. (2002). Formal Semantics and Analysis Methods for Simulink Stateflow.]&lt;/ref&gt; These diagrams, like Harel's original state machines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/asist/harel01.pdf Harel, D. (1987). A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems. Science of Computer Programming , 231–274.]&lt;/ref&gt; support hierarchically nested states, orthogonal regions, state actions, and transition actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~kanade/publications/symbolic_analysis_for_improving_simulation_coverage_of_simulink_stateflow_models.pdf Alur, R., Kanade, A., Ramesh, S., &amp; Shashidhar, K. C. (2008). Symbolic analysis for improving simulation coverage of Simulink/Stateflow models. International Conference on Embedded Software (pp. 89–98). Atlanta, GA: ACM.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== State diagrams versus flowcharts ==
Newcomers to the state machine formalism often confuse '''[[UML state machine#Basic UML state diagrams|state diagrams]]''' with '''[[flowchart]]s'''.  The figure below shows a comparison of a [[UML state machine#Basic UML state diagrams|state diagram]] with a flowchart. A state machine (panel (a)) performs actions in response to explicit events. In contrast, the flowchart (panel (b)) does not need explicit events but rather transitions from node to node in its graph automatically upon completion of activities.&lt;ref name="Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, Second Edition: Event-Driven Programming for Embedded Systems"&gt;{{cite book

 | page = 728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Image:statechart vs flowchart.png|State diagram (a) and flowchart (b)]]

Nodes of flowcharts are edges in the induced graph of states.
The reason is that each node in a flowchart represents a program command.
A program command is an action to be executed.
So it is not a state, but when applied to the program's state, it results in a transition to another state.

In more detail, the source code listing represents a program graph.
Executing the program graph (parsing and interpreting) results in a state graph.
So each program graph induces a state graph.
Conversion of the program graph to its associated state graph is called "unfolding" of the program graph.

The program graph is a sequence of commands.
If no variables exist, then the state consists only of the program counter, which keeps track of where in the program we are during execution (what is the next command to be applied).

In this case before executing a command the program counter is at some position (state before the command is executed).
Executing the command moves the program counter to the next command.
Since the program counter is the whole state, it follows that executing the command changed the state.
So the command itself corresponds to a transition between the two states.

Now consider the full case, when variables exist and are affected by the program commands being executed.
Then between different program counter locations, not only does the program counter change, but variables might also change values, due to the commands executed.
Consequently, even if we revisit some program command (e.g. in a loop), this doesn't imply the program is in the same state.

In the previous case, the program would be in the same state, because the whole state is just the program counter, so if the program counter points to the same position (next command) it suffices to specify that we are in the same state.
However, if the state includes variables, then if those change value, we can be at the same program location with different variable values, meaning in a different state in the program's state space.
The term "unfolding" originates from this multiplication of locations when producing the state graph from the program graph.

A representative example is a do loop incrementing some counter until it overflows and becomes 0 again.
Although the do loop executes the same increment command iteratively, so the program graph executes a cycle, in its state space is not a cycle, but a line.
This results from the state being the program location (here cycling) combined with the counter value, which is strictly increasing (until the overflow), so different states are visited in sequence, until the overflow.
After the overflow the counter becomes 0 again, so the initial state is revisited in the state space, closing a cycle in the state space (assuming the counter was initialized to 0).

The figure above attempts to show that reversal of roles by aligning the arcs of the state diagrams with the processing stages of the flowchart.

You can compare a flowchart to an assembly line in manufacturing because the flowchart describes the progression of some task from beginning to end (e.g., transforming source code input into object code output by a compiler). A state machine generally has no notion of such a progression. The door state machine shown at the top of this article, for example, is not in a more advanced stage when it is in the "closed" state, compared to being in the "opened" state; it simply reacts differently to the open/close events. A state in a state machine is an efficient way of specifying a particular behavior, rather than a stage of processing.

== Other extensions ==
An interesting extension is to allow arcs to flow from any number of states to any number of states.  This only makes sense if the system is allowed to be in multiple states at once, which implies that an individual state only describes a condition or other partial aspect of the overall, global state.  The resulting formalism is known as a [[Petri net]].

Another extension allows the integration of flowcharts within Harel statecharts. This extension supports the development of software that is both event driven and workflow driven.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3841">In [[psychology]], a '''stimulus''' is any object or event that elicits a sensory or behavioral response in an organism.  

*In [[perceptual psychology]], a stimulus is an energy change (e.g., light or sound) which is registered by the [[sense]]s (e.g., vision, hearing, taste, etc.) and constitutes the basis for [[perception]].&lt;ref name="stimulus"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Stimulus|editor=Richard L. Gregory |title=The Oxford Companion to the Mind|location=Oxford, N.Y.|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In [[behavioral psychology]] (i.e., [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning|operant]] conditioning), a stimulus constitutes the basis for [[behavior]].&lt;ref name="stimulus" /&gt; In this context, a distinction is made between the ''distal stimulus'' (the external, perceived object) and the ''proximal stimulus'' (the stimulation of sensory organs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.learner.org/series/discoveringpsychology/07/e07glossary.html | title=7: Sensation and Perception | work=Annenberg Learner | accessdate=August 15, 2016 | series=Discovering Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In [[experimental psychology]], a stimulus is the event or object to which a response is measured. Thus, not everything that is presented to participants qualifies as stimulus. For example, a [[cross mark]] at the center of a screen is not said to be a stimulus, because it merely serves to center participants' gaze on the screen. Also, it is uncommon to refer to longer events (e.g. the [[Trier social stress test]]) as a stimulus, even if a response to such an event is measured.

==History==
In the second half of the 19th century, the term ''stimulus'' was coined in [[psychophysics]] by defining the field as the "scientific study of the relation between stimulus and [[Sensation (psychology)|sensation]]".&lt;ref name=GescheiderpIX&gt;{{cite book |author=Gescheider, G. |year=1997 |title=Psychophysics: the fundamentals |edition=3rd |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |page=ix |isbn=0-8058-2281-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have led [[James J. Gibson]] to conclude that "whatever could be controlled by an experimenter and applied to an observer could be thought of as a stimulus" in early psychological studies with humans, while around the same time, the term stimulus described anything eliciting a [[reflex]] in animal research.&lt;ref name="Gibson, James J. 1960 pp. 694"&gt;Gibson, James J. (1960): "The Concept of the Stimulus in Psychology". ''[[American Psychologist]]'', 15, pp. 694–703, here p.694.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===In behavioral psychology===
The concept ''stimulus'' was essential to [[behaviorism]] and the behavioral theory of [[B. F. Skinner]] in particular. Within such a framework several kinds of stimuli have been distinguished (see also [[classical conditioning]]):

An '''eliciting stimulus''' was defined as a stimulus that precedes a certain behavior and thus causes a response. A '''discriminative stimulus''' in contrast increases the probability of a response to occur, but does not necessarily elicit the response. A '''reinforcing stimulus''' usually denoted a stimulus delivered after the response has already occurred; in psychological experiments it was often delivered on purpose to reinforce the behavior. '''Emotional stimuli''' were regarded as not eliciting a response. Instead, they were thought to modify the strength or vigor with which a behavior is carried out.&lt;ref name = "Skinner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skinner|first=B. F.|title=The Behavior of Organisms:  An Experimental Analysis|year=1938|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SuperWrite''' is an English [[shorthand]] system based largely on previous shorthand systems and largely intended for people who need to increase their writing speed without devoting months to learning more complicated systems.  It is a [[writing system]], as it uses cursive forms of the letters of the spoken [[alphabet]] to represent sounds.  Aside from assigning special [[Abbreviation|abbreviations]] to [[common words]], the system functions largely by omitting short [[Vowel|vowels]] from within words.  Hence, SuperWrite could be considered an impure [[abjad]].  Its publishers claim it uses only the 26 letters of the [[longhand]] alphabet with no extra [[Symbol|symbols]], however, the [[Letter case|capital letters]] used (C, O, S, T, U, X) have different functions from their [[lowercase]] forms, and the uncrossed '''t''' — which would be considered a mistake in longhand — has a different function from the crossed '''t''', bringing the total number of symbols in SuperWrite to 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Lemaster | first=A James | year=1990 | title=SuperWrite : alphabetic writing system.

'''Supererogation''' ([[Latin|Late Latin]]: ''supererogatio'' "payment beyond what is due or asked", from ''super'' "beyond" and ''erogare'' "to pay out, expend", itself from ''ex'' "out" and ''rogare'' "to ask") is the performance of more than is asked for; the action of doing more than [[duty]] requires. In [[ethics]], an act is '''supererogatory''' if it is good but not morally required to be done. It refers to an act that is more than is necessary, when another course of action—involving less—would still be an acceptable action. It differs from a duty, which is an act wrong not to do, and from acts morally neutral. Supererogation may be considered as performing above and beyond a normative course of duty to further benefits and functionality.

==In Catholicism==
In the [[theology]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], "works of supererogation" (also called "acts of supererogation") are those performed beyond what God requires. For example, in [[1 Corinthians 7]], [[Paul the Apostle]] says that while everyone is free to marry, it is better to refrain from marriage and remain celibate to better serve God. The Roman Catholic Church holds that the [[counsels of perfection]] are supererogatory acts, which specific [[Christian]]s may engage in above their moral duties. Similarly, it teaches that to determine how to act, one must engage in reasonable efforts to be sure of what the right actions are; after the reasonable action, the person is in a state of [[vincible ignorance|invincible ignorance]] and guiltless of wrongdoing, but to undertake more than reasonable actions to overcome ignorance is supererogatory, and praiseworthy.

According to the classic teaching on [[indulgence]]s, the works of supererogation performed by all the saints form a treasure with God, the "[[treasury of merit,]]" which the church can apply to exempt [[repentance (Christianity)|repentant]] sinners from the works of [[penance|penitence]] that would otherwise be required of them to achieve full reconciliation with the church.

==In Protestantism==
[[Martin Luther]]'s opposition of this teaching seeded the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Church of England]] denied the doctrine of supererogation in the fourteenth of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], which states that works of supererogation

&lt;blockquote&gt;
cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety: for by them men do declare, that they not only render unto God as much as they are bound to, but that they do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer_(ECUSA)/Historical_Documents_of_the_Church/Articles_of_Religion Book of Common Prayer (ECUSA)/Historical Documents of the Church/Articles of Religion. XIV.  Of Works of Supererogation.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later Protestant movements followed suit, such as in the [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/the-articles-of-religion-of-the-methodist-church The Methodist Articles of Religion/Doctrinal Standards of The United Methodist Church/Articles of Religion. XI. Of Works of Supererogation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
A [[Muslim]] must complete a minimum of the [[Salah#The Five Daily Prayers|five daily prayers]], each typically lasting an average of 5 to 10 minutes. Supererogatory prayers beyond these are known as [[Nafl prayer|nafl]] prayers, and praying them is considered to bear additional reward. There are also several other supererogatory acts in [[Islam]], such as fasting outside of the month of [[Ramadhan]], or giving [[sadaqah]] (charity, consisting of simple acts of kindness to financial assistance) that is not obligatory.

==Discussion==
Whether an act is supererogatory or obligatory can be debated. In many schools of thought, donating money to [[Charitable organization|charity]] is supererogatory. In other schools of thought that regard some level of charitable donation to be duty (such as with the [[tithe]] in [[Judaism]], [[zakat]] in Islam, and similar standards in many Christian sects), only exceeding a certain level of donation (e.g. going above the common 2.5%-of-capital-assets standard in zakat) would count as supererogatory.

In [[criminal law]], it may be observed that state prohibitions on killing, stealing, and so on derive from the state's duty to protect one's own citizens. However, a nation state has no duty to protect the citizens of an adjacent nation from crime. To send a [[peacekeeping]] force into another country would be — in the view of the nation doing it — supererogatory.

Some schools of ethics do not include supererogatory acts. In [[utilitarianism]], an act can only be better because it would bring more good to a greater number, and in that case it becomes a duty, not a supererogatory act. The lack of a notion of supererogation in utilitarianism and related schools leads to the [[demandingness objection]], arguing that these schools are too ethically demanding, requiring unreasonable acts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3725">'''Sustainable refurbishment''' describes working on existing buildings to improve their environmental performance using sustainable methods and materials.

Sustainable refurbishment is the equivalent of [[sustainable development]] which relates to new developments of cities, buildings or industries etc.
Sustainable refurbishment includes [[building insulation|insulation]] and related measures to reduce the energy consumption of buildings, installation of [[renewable energy]] sources such as solar water heating and [[photovoltaics]], measures to reduce water consumption, and changes to reduce overheating, improve ventilation and improve internal comfort. The process of sustainable refurbishment includes minimizing the waste of existing components, [[recycling]] and using [[environmentally friendly]] materials, and minimizing energy use, noise and waste during the refurbishment.

The importance of sustainable refurbishment is that the majority of buildings in use are not new and thus were constructed when energy standards were low or non-existent, and are otherwise incompatible with current standards or the expectations of users. Much of the existing building stock is likely to be in use for many years to come since demolition and replacement is often unacceptable owing to cost, social disruption or because the building is of architectural and/or historical interest. The solution is to refurbish or renovate such buildings to make them appropriate for current and future use and to satisfy current requirements and standards of energy use and comfort.

Sustainable refurbishment is not a new concept but is gaining recognition and importance owing to current concerns about high energy use leading to [[climate change]], overheating in buildings, the need for healthy internal environments, waste and environmental damage associated with materials production. Many governments are beginning to realize the importance of sustainably renovating their existing building stock, rather than just raising standards for new buildings and developments, and are producing guidance and grants and other support and stimulation activities. Think-tanks, lobby groups and voluntary organizations continue to publicize and promote the need for and practice of sustainable refurbishment. Examples and demonstration projects abound in many countries.

The techniques of sustainable refurbishment have been developing over many years and though the principles are very similar to those used on new buildings, the practice and details appropriate for the wide range of situations found in old buildings has required development of specific solutions and guidance to optimize the process and avoid subsequent problems. Detailed technical guidance is widely available from government-sponsored sources.

'''Traffic signs''' or '''road signs''' are signs erected at the side of or above [[road]]s to give instructions or provide information to road users. The earliest signs were simple wooden or stone milestones. Later, signs with directional arms were introduced, for example, the [[fingerpost]]s in the United Kingdom and their wooden counterparts in [[Saxon post milestone|Saxony]].

With traffic volumes increasing since the 1930s, many countries have adopted pictorial signs or otherwise simplified and standardized their signs to overcome language barriers, and enhance traffic safety. Such pictorial signs use symbols (often silhouettes) in place of words and are usually based on international protocols. Such signs were first developed in Europe, and have been adopted by most countries to varying degrees.

==International conventions==
Various international conventions have helped to achieve a degree of uniformity in Traffic Signing in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Traffic Signs Manual Introduction  1982 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/203662/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-01.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kuh-Warnung.jpg|thumb|Sign warning of cattle crossing in a rural road of [[Madeira|Madeira island]], [[Portugal]]]]

Traffic signs can be grouped into several types. For example, Annexe 1 of the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]] (1968), which on 30 June 2004 had 52 signatory countries, defines eight categories of signs:
*A. Danger [[warning sign]]s
*B. [[Priority signs]]
*C. [[Prohibitory traffic sign|Prohibitory]] or restrictive signs
*D. [[Mandatory sign]]s
*E. [[Special regulation sign]]s
*F. [[Information sign|Information, facilities, or service signs]]
*G. [[Direction, position, or indication sign]]s
*H. Additional panels

In the United States, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand signs are categorized as follows:
*[[Regulatory sign]]s
*[[Warning sign]]s
*Guide signs
**[[Street name sign]]s
**[[Highway shield|Route marker]] signs
**[[Limited-access road|Expressway]] signs
**[[Freeway]] signs
**[[Welcome sign]]s
**Informational signs

In the United States, the categories, placement, and graphic standards for traffic signs and [[pavement marker (roads)|pavement markings]] are legally defined in the [[Federal Highway Administration]]'s ''[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]'' as the standard.

A rather informal distinction among the directional signs is the one between advance directional signs, interchange directional signs, and reassurance signs. Advance directional signs appear at a certain distance from the interchange, giving information for each direction. A number of countries do not give information for the road ahead (so-called "pull-through" signs), and only for the directions left and right. Advance directional signs enable drivers to take precautions for the exit (e.g., switch lanes, double check whether this is the correct exit, slow down).
They often do not appear on lesser roads, but are normally posted on expressways and motorways, as drivers would be missing exits without them. While each nation has its own system, the first approach sign for a motorway exit is mostly placed at least {{convert|1000|m}} from the actual interchange. After that sign, one or two additional advance directional signs typically follow before the actual interchange itself.

==History==
[[File:Campidoglio - il miliarium.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Roman milestone]]
[[File:SinalTransitoSalvador.JPG|thumb|right|17th century traffic sign in Salvador street, [[Lisbon]], Portugal stating which traffic should back up to give way:&lt;br&gt;''Year of 1686. [[Peter II of Portugal|His Majesty]] commands all [[coach (vehicle)|coach]]es, [[carriage]]s and [[litter (vehicle)|litter]]s coming from Salvador's entrance to back up to the same part'']]
[[File:Traffic Camera.svg|thumb|right|Speed camera sign used in Canada, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Hong Kong, Iceland, Iran, Ireland, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom]]

The earliest road signs were [[milestone]]s, giving distance or direction; for example, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] erected stone columns throughout their empire giving the distance to Rome. In the [[Middle Ages]], multidirectional signs at intersections became common, giving directions to cities and towns.

In 1686, the first known Traffic Regulation Act in Europe is established by King [[Peter II of Portugal]]. This act foresees the placement of [[priority sign]]s in the narrowest streets of [[Lisbon]], stating which traffic should back up to give way. One of these signs still exists at Salvador street, in [[Alfama|the neighborhood of Alfama]].

The first modern road signs erected on a wide scale were designed for riders of high or "ordinary" bicycles in the late 1870s and early 1880s. These machines were fast, silent and their nature made them difficult to control, moreover their riders travelled considerable distances and often preferred to tour on unfamiliar roads. For such riders, cycling organizations began to erect signs that warned of potential hazards ahead (particularly steep hills), rather than merely giving distance or directions to places, thereby contributing the sign type that defines "modern" traffic signs.

The development of automobiles encouraged more complex [[signage systems]] using more than just text-based notices. One of the first modern-day road sign systems was devised by the Italian Touring Club in 1895. By 1900, a Congress of the International League of Touring Organizations in Paris was considering proposals for standardization of road signage. In 1903 the British government introduced four "national" signs based on shape, but the basic patterns of most traffic signs were set at the 1908 [[International Road Congress]] in [[Paris]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} In 1909, nine European governments agreed on the use of four pictorial symbols, indicating "bump", "curve", "intersection", and "grade-level railroad crossing". The intensive work on international road signs that took place between 1926 and 1949 eventually led to the development of the European road sign system. Both Britain and the United States developed their own road signage systems, both of which were adopted or modified by many other nations in their respective spheres of influence. The UK adopted a version of the European road signs in 1964 and, over past decades, North American signage began using some symbols and graphics mixed in with English.

Over the years, change was gradual. Pre-industrial signs were stone or wood, but with the development of Darby's method of smelting iron using coke, painted cast iron became favoured in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Cast iron continued to be used until the mid-20th century, but it was gradually displaced by aluminium or other materials and processes, such as vitreous enamelled and/or pressed malleable iron, or (later) steel. Since 1945 most signs have been made from sheet aluminium with adhesive plastic coatings; these are normally [[Retroreflector|retroreflective]] for nighttime and low-light visibility. Before the development of reflective plastics, reflectivity was provided by glass reflectors set into the lettering and symbols.

New generations of traffic signs based on electronic displays can also change their text (or, in some countries, symbols) to provide for "intelligent control" linked to automated traffic sensors or remote manual input. In over 20 countries, real-time [[Traffic Message Channel]] incident warnings are conveyed directly to vehicle navigation systems using inaudible signals carried via FM radio, 3G cellular data and satellite broadcasts. Finally, cars can pay tolls and trucks pass safety screening checks using video numberplate scanning, or RFID transponders in windshields linked to antennae over the road, in support of on-board signalling, toll collection, and travel time monitoring.

Yet another "medium" for transferring information ordinarily associated with visible signs is [[RIAS (Remote Infrared Audible Signage)]], e.g., "talking signs" for print-handicapped (including blind/low-vision/illiterate) people. These are infra-red transmitters serving the same purpose as the usual graphic signs when received by an appropriate device such as a hand-held receiver or one built into a cell phone.

Road signs in Japan are either controlled by local police authorities under {{nihongo|Road Traffic Law|道路交通法|Dōro Kōtsūhō}} or by other road-controlling entities including [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]], local municipalities, [[NEXCO]] (companies controlling expressways), under {{nihongo|Road Law|道路法|Dōrohō}}. Most of the design of the road signs in Japan are similar to the signs on the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals|Vienna Convention]], except for some significant variances, such as stop sign with a red downward triangle. The main signs are categorized into four meaning types: 
* Guidance (white characters on blue in general – on green in expressways), 
* Warning (black characters and symbols on yellow diamond), 
* Regulation (red or blue circle, depending on prohibition or regulation), 
* And instruction (mostly white characters or symbols on blue square).

[[File:AH26 (N1) sign.svg|thumb|150px|Route marker sign for [[Pan-Philippine Highway|Asian Highway 26]], as seen on [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]] and the Maharlika Highway.]]

Road signs in the Philippines are standardized in the ''Road Signs and Pavement Markings Manual'', published by the [[Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines)|Department of Public Works and Highways]]. Philippine road signage practice closely follow those used in [[Europe]], but with local adaptations and some minor influences from the US [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|MUTCD]] and [[Road signs in Australia|Australian road signs]]. However, some road signs may differ by locale, and mostly diverge from the national standard. For example, the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA) has used pink and light blue in its signage for which it has been heavily criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/90633/news/nation/mmda-defends-pink-as-traffic-enforcement-standard|title=MMDA defends 'pink' as traffic enforcement standard|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/146746/news/nation/probe-looms-over-mmda-s-pink-traffic-signs|title=Probe looms over MMDA's pink traffic signs|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Road signs in the Philippines are classified as:
*Regulatory signs
*Warning signs
*Guide signs
*Expressway signs
*Traffic instruction signs

Regulatory road signs – other than the stop and give way signs – are generally circular, with (for prohibitions) a black symbol on a white background within a red border, or (for mandatory instructions) a white symbol on a blue background. In some cases circular regulatory signs are placed on white rectangular panels together with text supplementing their meanings.

Most warning signs display a black symbol on a white background within a red-bordered equilateral triangle. Since 2012, however, a more visibly distinctive design (taken from that used for school signs in the US) has been adopted for pedestrian-related signs: these consist of a fluorescent yellow-green pentagon with black border and symbol. Additional panels may be placed below signs to supplement their meanings.

Guide signs are divided into directional signs, service area signs, route markers, and tourist-related signs, with influence from both American and Australian practice. Directional signs use a green background with white letters and arrows. Service area signs use a blue background with white letters, arrows, and symbols. Tourist-related signs use a brown background with white letters, arrows, and symbols. The [[Reassurance marker|route marker sign]], excluding the [[Pan-Philippine Highway|AH26]] route marker, is based on the Australian National Route marker, but reserved for future use.

Signs on expressways mostly take elements from [[Freeways in Australia|Australian motorway/freeway]] signs. Exit signs, wrong way signs and start/end of expressway signs are very similar to Australian freeway signage. Traffic instruction signs are textual signs used to supplement warning and regulatory signs.

[[File:Beussent Sign.JPG|thumb|Road sign in [[Beussent]], France - entrance to built up area with an implied {{nowrap|{{convert|50|km/h}}}} speed limit.]]
Since the signing of the 1931 Geneva Convention concerning the Unification of Road Signals by a number of countries that the standardization of the traffic signs started in Europe. The 1931 Convention rules were developed in the 1949 Geneva Protocol on Road Signs and Signals.

In 1968, the European countries signed the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] treaty, with the aim of standardizing traffic regulations in participating countries in order to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety. Part of the treaty was the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]], which defined the traffic signs and signals. As a result, in Western Europe the traffic signs are well standardized, although there are still some country-specific exceptions, mostly dating from the pre-1968 era.

The principle of the European traffic sign standard is that certain shapes and colours are to be used with consistent meanings:
* Triangular signs (black symbols on a white or yellow background) warn of dangers. The Vienna Convention additionally allows an alternative shape for such signs, namely a right-angled diamond – although in Europe this shape is regularly used only in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. 
* Regulatory signs are round: those indicating a prohibition or limit are black on white (or yellow) with a red border; those giving a mandatory order are white on blue. 
* Informational and various other secondary signs are of rectangular shape. 
* The animals which may be depicted on warning signs include cattle, deer, ducks, elk, frogs, horses, sheep, monkeys (in [[Gibraltar]]), and [[polar bear]]s (on [[Svalbard]]). The Convention allows any animal image to be used.

Directional signs ("guide signs" in American parlance) have not been harmonized under the Convention, at least not on ordinary roads. As a result, there are substantial differences in directional signage throughout Europe. Differences apply to the choice of typeface, arrows and, most notably, colours. The convention does, however, specify that the type of directional signage used should, for each country, distinguish limited-access roads ("motorways") from ordinary, all-purpose roads.

Directional signage on motorways uses: 
* white-on-green in, for example, [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Turkey]]
* white-on-blue in, for example, [[Austria]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

Differences are greater for non-motorways: 
* White-on-blue in Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], Finland, Turkey, and the Netherlands (in this case the same as on motorways).
* White-on-green in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Poland, France, Hungary, and Portugal (only on the few primary roads that still have not been transformed in motorways), 
* Black-on-yellow in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovenia, Serbia, and Croatia. 
* Red-on-white in Denmark (though white-on-blue on motorway exits and all overhead gantries) 
* Black-on-white in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fomento.gob.es/NR/rdonlyres/10C10CF6-54D9-4732-AE70-26D36268DF9D/107300/1110401.pdf |format=PDF |title=Norma 8.1-I.C. |publisher=Ministerio de Fomento, Gobierno de España |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309063723/http://www.fomento.gob.es/NR/rdonlyres/10C10CF6-54D9-4732-AE70-26D36268DF9D/107300/1110401.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Anons keep adding more and more countries... these need to be verified--&gt;

The black-on-white signposting of secondary roads distinguishes them from primary roads in Finland, France, Portugal, the [[Republic of Ireland]], Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and Sweden black-on-white indicates urban-only roads or urban destinations.

The signposting of road numbers also differs greatly, except that [[European route number]]s, if displayed, are always indicated using white characters on a green rectangle. European route numbers are, however, not signed at all in the United Kingdom.

The Convention recommends that certain signs – such as "[[Stop sign|STOP]]", "ZONE", etc. – be in English; however, use of the local language is also permitted. If a language uses non-Latin characters, a [[Latin script|Latin-script]] transliteration of the names of cities and other important places should also be given. Road signs in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are bilingual, using [[Irish language|Irish]] and English. [[Wales]] similarly uses bilingual [[Welsh language|Welsh]]–English signs, while some parts of [[Scotland]] have bilingual [[Scottish Gaelic]]–English signs. Finland also uses bilingual signs, in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Signs in Belgium are in French, Dutch, or German depending on the region. In the Brussels Capital Region, road signs are in both French and Dutch. Signs in Switzerland are in [[French language|French]], [[Swiss Standard German|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], or [[Romansh language|Romansh]] depending on the canton.

European countries – with the notable exception of the United Kingdom, where distances and lengths are indicated in miles, yards, feet, and inches, and speed limits are expressed in miles per hour – use the [[metric system]] on road signs.

For countries driving on the left, the convention stipulates that the traffic signs should be mirror images of those used in countries driving on the right. This practice, however, is not systematically followed in the four European countries driving on the left, Cyprus, [[Malta]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], and the United Kingdom. The convention permits the use of two background colours for danger and prohibition signs: white or yellow. Most countries use white, with a few – such as Finland, [[Iceland]], Poland, and Sweden – opting for yellow as this tends to improve the winter-time visibility of signs in areas where snow is prevalent. In some countries, such as France, white is the normal background colour for such signs, but yellow is used for temporary signage (as, for example, at road works).

European traffic signs have been designed with the principles of [[heraldry]] in mind;{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} i.e., the sign must be clear and able to be resolved at a glance. Most traffic signs conform to heraldic tincture rules, and use symbols rather than written texts for better [[semiotics|semiotic]] clarity.

===Croatia===
Croatian road signs follow the Vienna convention ([[SFR Yugoslavia]] was the original signatory for Croatia, which is now a contracting party itself). The most common signs are: 
* Yellow and black signs ''for direction''.
* Blue and white signs ''for information''.
* White-on-green signs are used on the highways.

In the first years following Croatia's independence, its traffic signs were the same as in the rest of the former Yugoslavia. In the early 2000s, replacement of the yellow background of warning signs began, and new signs now use a white background.

The signage typeface is [[SNV (typeface)|SNV]], as with the other countries of the former Yugoslavia.

===Iceland===
{{Main|Road signs in Iceland}}
Road signs in Iceland mainly follow the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals|Vienna Convention]], but use a variant of the colour scheme and minor design changes similar to the signs in Sweden.

===Ireland===
[[File:Sign on the N8 at it's terminus on the M7.jpg|thumb|left|Advance directional sign in for a roundabout in Ireland.

[[File:Ireland road sign W 120.svg|thumb|[[Road signs in Ireland#Warning signs|Irish warning sign

{{Main|Road signs in the Republic of Ireland}}
Until the partition of [[Ireland]] in 1922 and the independence of the [[Irish Free State]] (now the [[Republic of Ireland]]), British standards applied across the island. In 1926 road sign standards similar to those used in the UK at the time were adopted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI55Y1926.html S.I. No. 55/1926: Road Signs and Traffic Signals Regulations, 1926] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226051244/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI55Y1926.html |date=2006-02-26 }} – [[Irish Statute Book]]&lt;/ref&gt; Law requires that the signs be written in both [[Irish language|Irish]] and English.

In 1956, road signs in the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]] were changed from the UK standard with the adoption of US-style "diamond" signs for many road hazard warnings (junctions, bends, railway crossings, traffic lights).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI284Y1956.html S.I. No. 284/1956: Traffic Signs Regulations, 1956] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905152429/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI284Y1956.html |date=2006-09-05 }} - Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt; Some domestic signs were also invented, such as the keep-left sign (a black curved arrow pointing to the upper-left, although some are similar to the European "white arrow on blue disk" signs), while some other signs are not widely adopted outside Ireland, such as the no-entry sign (a black arrow pointing ahead in a white circle with a red slashed circumference).

Directional signage is similar to current United Kingdom standards. The same colours are used for directional signs in Ireland as in the UK, and the UK Transport and Motorway fonts are used. Unlike Wales and Scotland, where Welsh and Gaelic place-names use the upright Transport face, Irish place-names are rendered in an italic face.

In January 2005 Ireland adopted metric speed limits. Around 35,000 existing signs were replaced and a further 23,000 new signs erected bearing the speed limit in kilometres per hour. To avoid confusion with the old signs, each speed limit sign now has "km/h" beneath the numerals. Also, since the adoption of signs based on the ''Warboys Committee'' standard in 1977, Irish directional signs have used the metric system; however, unlike with the later speed limit changeover, there was no effort made to change the existing signage, and {{As of|2007|lc=on}} many finger posts still remain on rural roads with distances in miles, although the numbers continue to decline as roads are improved.

In late 2007 Ireland began an extensive programme of sign and post replacement. Good examples are the M1 ([[Dublin]]–[[Dundalk]]) and the M50 ([[Dublin]]). While being mostly the same as the old signs, it is welcome as a lot of the signs were damaged/stained. About half of the new posts are now two medium posts with crosshatched metal posts in-between instead of one large pole to minimise the damage in case of a crash.

===Latvia===
Road signs in Latvia largely adhere to [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals|Vienna Convention]] guidelines. In detailed design they closely resemble the signs used in Germany.

===Netherlands===
{{Main|Road signs in the Netherlands}}
Road signs in the Netherlands follow the Vienna Convention. Directional signs (which have not been harmonized under the Convention) always use blue as the background colour. The destinations on the sign are printed in white. If the destination is not a town (but an area within town or some other kind of attraction), that destination will be printed in black on a separate white background within the otherwise blue sign.

The Netherlands always signposts European road numbers where applicable (i.e., on the advance directional signs, the interchange direction signs and on the [[Reassurance marker|reassurance signs]]). Dutch national road numbers are placed on a rectangle, with motorways being signposted in white on a red rectangle (as an A''xx'') and primary roads in black on a yellow rectangle (as N''xx''). When a motorway changes to a primary road, its number remains the same, but the A is replaced by the N. So at a certain point the A2 becomes N2, and when it changes to a motorway again, it becomes A2 again.

Signs intended for bike-riders always go on white signs with red or green letters.

The Dutch typeface, known as ANWB-Ee, is based on the US typeface. A new font, named ANWB-Uu (also known as Redesign), has been developed in 1997 and appears on many recent Dutch signs. On the motorways however the typeface remains the ANWB-Ee or a similar typeface. The language of the signs is typically Dutch, even though bilingual signs may be used, when the information is relevant for tourists.

===Norway===
{{Main|Road signs in Norway}}
[[File:Norwegian-road-sign-713.svg|thumb|Upper left and right and middle right are standard directional signs. Lower left is for a commercial facility, and lower right is for a temporary detour.]]

Signs in Norway mostly follow the Vienna Convention, except the polar bear warning sign, which is a white bear on a black background and a red border. 
These are the directional signs:
* Signs for motorways are blue with white text 
* Those for regular roads to towns and cities are yellow with black lettering
* Signs for industrial areas, commercial facilities etc. are white with black letters
* Signs for tourist attractions, national parks, museums etc. are brown with white lettering

The signs for road numbering are rectangular, and have this colour scheme:
* European routes (E6, E18, etc.) are green with white lettering
* National routes are also green with white lettering
* Province owned roads are white with black lettering
* Municipality owned roads have the name of the road, instead of a number, and are white with black lettering

===Sweden===
[[File:Moose-warning.svg|thumb|right|Swedish [[Moose|elk]] warning sign]]
{{Main|Road signs in Sweden}}
The road signs in Sweden mostly follow the Vienna Convention with a few adaptations, however, allowed within the convention:
* The background of warning signs is yellow
* Warning signs for elk and reindeer
* The background of direction signs is blue with white text
* The background of motorway direction signs is green with white text
* When applicable, the language is [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in Sweden.

The signage typeface [[Tratex]] is used exclusively in Sweden and is available as [[freeware]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vv.se/templates/page3____2789.aspx Teckensnitt på vägmärken / Vägverket&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420173537/http://www.vv.se/templates/page3____2789.aspx |date=2006-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland and Liechtenstein===
[[File:CH-Hinweissignal-Wegweiser in Tabellenform.svg|thumb|right|Swiss signpost in table format]]
{{Main|Road signs in Switzerland and Liechtenstein}}

Even though Switzerland is not a member of the EU, the road signs mostly follow the Vienna Convention with a few adaptations and exceptions. Road signs are categorized as follows:

*Warning signs
*Prohibition signs (Regulatory)
*Mandatory instruction signs (Regulatory)
*Priority signs
*Conducting indication signs
*Routing indication signs
*Informational signs
*Complementary panels
*Road markings
*Traffic lights
*Police instructions

Distances and other measurements are displayed in [[Metric system|metric]] units. Starting 2003, [[ASTRA-Frutiger]] is the typeface used to replace [[SNV (typeface)|SNV]], which is still used in several European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/newzzdb6ac1f2-12-1.201330 |title="Frutiger" für die Strasse |language=de |newspaper=[[NZZ]] |location=Zurich, Switzerland |date=20 January 2003 |author=rel |accessdate=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major exceptions from the norm are:

*Signs use one of the four national languages corresponding to the location.
*Destinations are spelled according to their local spelling, e.g. Genève for Geneva, also in German or Italian Switzerland.
*Motor-/expressway signs are white text on green background.
*Main road/route signs are white text on blue background.
*Minor road/route signs are black text on white background.
*Detour route signs are black text on orange background.
[[File:CH-Hinweissignal-Bergpoststrasse.svg|thumb|right|[[Road signs in Switzerland and Liechtenstein#Conducting indication signs|Swiss sign no. 4.05 Mountain postal road]]]]
*Bicycle and mountain bike routes, and routes for vehicle-like transport means are white text on falu red background.
*Commercial direction signs are black text on grey background with a red dot.
*Mandatory generally maximum speed limit of 50&amp;nbsp;km/h within urban settings is valid with entry of a village or town (sign no. 4.27 or 4.29) even without producing the corresponding sign (sign no. 2.30.1).
*Mountain postal road sign (sign no. 4.05 and 4.06) indicating priority to public transport on (mountain) roads.
*There are more priority signs than usual (often related to the [[Priority to the right]] rule).

{{Main|Road signs in the United Kingdom}}
Traffic signing in the UK conforms broadly to European norms, though a number of signs are unique to Britain and direction signs omit [[International E-road network|European route numbers]]. The current sign system, introduced on 1 January 1965, was developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s by the Anderson Committee, which established the [[motorway]] signing system, and by the [[Worboys Committee]], which reformed signing for existing all-purpose roads. (For illustrations of most British road signs, see 'Know your traffic signs'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/know-your-traffic-signs&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[GOV.UK]] website.)

The UK remains the only [[European Union]] member nation and the only Commonwealth country to use non-[[metric system|metric]] ([[imperial unit|Imperial]]) measurements for distance and speed, although "authorised weight" signs have been in metric tonnes since 1981 and there is currently a dual-unit (metric first) option for height and width restriction signage, intended for use on safety grounds. On motorways kilometre signs are visible at intervals of {{convert|500|m}} indicating the distance from the start of the motorway. (See [[Driver location sign]]).

Three colour schemes exist for direction signs: 
* On motorways they are blue with white lettering
* On primary routes they are green with white lettering and yellow route numbers
* A non-primary route has white signs with black lettering
* A fourth colour scheme, black on yellow, is seen on temporary signs, for example marking a diversionary route avoiding a road closure.

Two [[typeface]]s are specified for British road signs. [[Transport (typeface)|Transport]] "Medium" or Transport "Heavy" are used for all text on fixed permanent signs and most temporary signage, depending on the colour of the sign and associated text colour; dark text on a white background is normally set in "Heavy" so that it stands out better. However route numbers on motorway signs use a taller limited character set typeface called "Motorway".

Signs are generally [[bilingual sign|bilingual]] in all parts of Wales (English/[[Welsh language|Welsh]] or Welsh/English), and similar signs are beginning to be seen in parts of the [[Scottish Highlands]] (English/[[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]).

All signs and their associated regulations can be found in the [[Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2002/20023113.htm |title=The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 |publisher=opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as updated by the TSRGD 2008, TSRGD 2011 and TSRGD 2016 and complemented by the various chapters of the "Traffic Signs Manual".

===Color schemes{{anchor|Color schemes}}===
The [[Northern America]]n, [[Australia]]n, and [[New Zealand]] colors normally have these meanings:
*[[red]] with white for [[stop sign]]s, yield, and forbidden actions (such as No Parking)
*[[green]] with white letters for informational signs, such as directions, distances, and places
*[[brown]] with white letters for signs to [[park]]s, [[historic site]]s, [[ski area]]s, [[forest]]s, and [[campground]]s
*[[blue]] with white symbols (or [[logo sign|business logos]]) for [[rest area]]s, [[food]], [[gasoline]], [[hospitals]], [[lodging]], and other services
*[[white]] with [[black]] (or [[red]]) letters for regulatory signs, such as [[speed limit]]s (or [[parking]])
*[[yellow]] with black letters and [[symbol]]s for warning signs, such as curves and [[school zone]]s
*[[orange (color)|orange]] with black letters for temporary traffic control zones and [[Detour (road)|detour]]s associated with [[road construction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno-history.htm|title=The Evolution of MUTCD|work=dot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[purple]] for "lanes restricted to use only by vehicles with registered [[electronic toll collection]] (ETC) accounts",&lt;ref name=mutcd1a12&gt;[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part1/part1a.htm#section1A12 Section 1A.12 Color Code], ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices''&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[EZPass]].
*[[black]] with white letters or arrows for lane use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbc.com/driver-licensing/Getting-licensed/drivers3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Signs, signals and road markings |publisher=icbc.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022032056/http://www.icbc.com/driver-licensing/Getting-licensed/drivers3.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices'' prescribes four other colors:
&lt;ref name=mutcd1a12/&gt;
*[[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[yellow-green]] with black symbols for school zone, school bus stop, pedestrian, playground, and bicycle warning signs
*fluorescent [[pink]] with black letters and symbols for [[incident management]] signs
*[[coral (color)|coral]] and [[light blue]], which are unassigned but reserved for potential future use.

Regulatory signs are also sometimes seen with white letters on red or black signs. In [[Quebec]], blue is often used for public services such as rest areas; many black-on-yellow signs are red-on-white instead.

Many [[US states]] and [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] now use fluorescent orange for construction signs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part6/part6f.htm#section6F02 Section 6F.02 General Characteristics of Signs] [Temporary Traffic Control], ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highway symbols and markers===
[[File:Route 663 sign.JPG|thumb|left|Rural highway sign, [[Saskatchewan]].]]
Every state and province has different [[Highway shield|markers]] for its own highways, but use standard ones for all federal highways. Many special highways – such as the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]], [[Trans-Canada Highway]], and various [[auto trail]]s in the U.S. – have used unique signs. Counties in the US sometimes use a [[pentagon]]al blue sign with yellow letters for numbered [[County highway|county roads]], though the use is inconsistent even within states.

===Units===
Distances on traffic signs generally follow the measurement system in use locally: that is to say, the [[metric system]] in all countries of the world except [[Burma]], [[Liberia]], the United Kingdom, and the United States – although the metric system is used in the UK for all purposes other than the display of road distances and the defining of speed limits, and in the US the Federal Department of Transportation has developed (very rarely used) metric standards for all signs.

===Languages===
[[File:Mistassini roadsign.jpg|thumb|1ight|Multilingual road signs in [[Mistissini, Quebec]] in [[Cree language|Cree]], English, and [[French language|French]].]]
Where signs use a language, the recognized language/s of the area is normally used. Signs in most of the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are in English. Quebec uses [[French language|French]], while [[New Brunswick]] and the [[Jacques Cartier Bridge|Jacques-Cartier]] and [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal|Champlain]] bridges, in Montreal (as well as some parts in the [[West Island]]), use both English and French, and a number of other provinces and states, such as [[Ontario]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Vermont]] use bilingual French–English signs in certain localities. Puerto Rico (a US territory) and Mexico use Spanish. Within a few miles of the [[US–Mexico border]], road signs are often in English and Spanish in places like San Diego, Yuma, and El Paso. Indigenous languages, mainly [[Nahuatl]] as well as some [[Mayan languages]], have been used as well.

===Typefaces===
The typefaces predominantly used on signs in the US and Canada are the [[Highway Gothic|FHWA alphabet series]] (Series B through Series F and Series E Modified). Details of letter shape and spacing for these alphabet series are given in "Standard Alphabets for Traffic Control Devices", first published by the [[Bureau of Public Roads]] (BPR) in 1945 and subsequently updated by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA). It is now part of Standard Highway Signs (SHS), the companion volume to the MUTCD which gives full design details for signfaces.

Initially, all of the alphabet series consisted of uppercase letters and digits only, although lowercase extensions were provided for each alphabet series in a 2002 revision of SHS. Series B through Series F evolved from identically named alphabet series which were introduced in 1927.

Straight-stroke letters in the 1927 series were substantially similar to their modern equivalents, but unrounded glyphs were used for letters such as B, C, D, etc., to permit more uniform fabrication of signs by illiterate painters. Various state highway departments and the federal BPR experimented with rounded versions of these letters in the following two decades.

The modern, rounded alphabet series were finally standardized in 1945 after rounded versions of some letters (with widths loosely appropriate for Series C or D) were specified as an option in the 1935 MUTCD and draft versions of the new typefaces had been used in 1942 for guide signs on the newly constructed [[Pentagon road network]].

The mixed-case alphabet now called Series E Modified, which is the standard for destination legend on freeway guide signs, originally existed in two parts: an all-uppercase Series E Modified, which was essentially similar to Series E, except for a larger stroke width, and a lowercase-only alphabet. Both parts were developed by the California Division of Highways (now [[Caltrans]]) for use on freeways in 1948–1950.

Initially, the Division used all-uppercase Series E Modified for [[button copy|button-reflectorized]] letters on ground-mounted signs and mixed-case legend (lowercase letters with Series D capitals) for externally illuminated overhead guide signs. Several Eastern turnpike authorities blended all-uppercase Series E Modified with the lowercase alphabet for destination legends on their guide signs.

Eventually, this combination was accepted for destination legend in the first manual for signing Interstate highways, which was published in 1958 by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|American Association of State Highway Officials]] and adopted as the national standard by the BPR.

====Uses of non-FHWA typefaces====
[[File:Michigan left lighted sign.jpg|right|thumb|Some traffic signs, such as the left-turn prohibition sign hanging from this gantry, are lit for better visibility, particularly at night or in inclement weather.]]
The US [[National Park Service]] uses [[NPS Rawlinson Roadway]], a [[serif]] typeface, for guide signage; it typically appears on a brown background. Rawlinson has replaced [[Clarendon (typeface)|Clarendon]] as the official NPS typeface, but some states still use Clarendon for recreational signage.

[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in the past, used uppercase Series D with a custom lowercase alphabet on its freeway guide signs; the most distinctive feature of this typeface is the lack of a dot on lowercase ''i'' and ''j''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gribblenation.com/gapics/gallery/i20w-exit60-natsiatka.jpg |title=Image |publisher=gribblenation.com |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent installations appear to include the dots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gribblenation.com/gapics/gallery/albany-exit2-3-natsiatka.jpg |title=Photo |publisher=gribblenation.com |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Clearview (typeface)|Clearview]] typeface, developed by US researchers to provide improved legibility, is permitted for light legend on dark backgrounds under FHWA interim approval. Clearview has seen widespread use by state departments of transportation in [[Arkansas]], [[Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holstege |first=Sean |date=11 September 2013 |title=Seeing double on I-17? It's a sign of safer times. |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/arizona/articles/20130904arizona-i-17-road-signs-doubled-up.html  |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |location=Phoenix, Arizona, USA |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dot.state.il.us/press/r101106.html Illinois Department of Transportation&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Texas]], and [[Virginia]]. The [[Kansas Turnpike Authority]] has also introduced Clearview typeface to some of its newer guide signs along the [[Kansas Turnpike]], but the state of [[Kansas]] continues to use the FHWA typefaces for signage on its non-tolled Interstates and freeways.

In [[Canada]], the Ministry of Transportation for the Province of [[British Columbia]] specifies Clearview for use on its highway guide signs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/popular-topics/faq.htm#general 2006 Internet Templates&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and its usage has shown up in [[Ontario]] on the [[Don Valley Parkway]] and [[Gardiner Expressway]] in [[Toronto]] and on new [[400-series highway (Ontario)|400-series highway]] installations in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Regional Municipality of Halton, Ontario|Halton]] and [[Regional Municipality of Niagara, Ontario|Niagara]], as well as street signs in various parts of the province. The font is also being used on newer signs in [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Quebec]].

[[File:Moosecrossingkenaiak.JPG|thumb|[[Moose]] crossing warning with kill-counter, [[Kenai Peninsula]] of [[Alaska]]. Prior to widespread human settlement, this area was part of the [[Kenai National Wildlife Refuge|Kenai National Moose Range]].]]
It is common for local governments, airport authorities, and contractors to fabricate traffic signs using typefaces other than the FHWA series; [[Helvetica]], [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] and [[Arial]] are common choices.

===New Zealand===
{{Main|Road signs in New Zealand}}
[[New Zealand]] road signs are generally influenced both by American and European practices.

Warning signs are diamond-shaped with a yellow background for permanent warnings, and an orange background for temporary warnings. They are somewhat more pictorial than their American counterparts. This is also true for Canadian signage.

Regulatory signs also follow European practice, with a white circle with a red border indicating prohibitive actions, and a blue circle indicating mandatory actions. White rectangular signs with a red border indicate lane usage directions. Information and direction signs are rectangular, with a green background indicating a [[state highway]], a blue background for all other roads and all services (except in some, where directional signage is white), and a brown background for tourist attractions.

Before 1987, most road signs had black backgrounds – diamonds indicated warnings, and rectangles indicated regulatory actions (with the exception of the Give Way sign (an inverted trapezium), and Stop sign and speed limit signs (which were the same as today)). Information signs were yellow, and direction signage was green on motorways and black everywhere else.

==South America, Central America and the Caribbean==
[[File:Belize Speed Bump Sign.JPG|thumb|Speed bump sign in [[Belize]].]]
Road signs in [[Caribbean]], [[Central America]], and [[South America]] vary from country to country. For the most part, conventions in signage tend to resemble United States signage conventions more so than European and Asian conventions. For example, warning signs are typically diamond-shaped and yellow rather than triangular and white. Some variations include the "Parking" and "No Parking" signs, which contain either a letter ''E'' or ''P'', depending on which word is used locally for "Parking" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''estacionamiento'' or ''parqueo'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''estacionamento''), as well as the Stop sign, which usually reads "Pare" or "Alto". Notable exceptions include speed limit signs, which follow the European conventions, and the "No Entry" sign, often replaced with a crossed upwards arrow.

===Colombia===
Traffic signs in Colombia are classified into three categories: 
* Warning signs
* Mandatory signs 
* Information signs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mintransporte.gov.co/Servicios/Biblioteca/documentos/Manual_senalizacion/index.htm Colombia traffic signs manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610234906/http://www.mintransporte.gov.co/Servicios/Biblioteca/documentos/Manual_senalizacion/index.htm |date=2008-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warning signs are very similar to warning signs in United States. They are yellow diamond-shaped with a black symbol (the yellow colour is changed to an orange colour in areas under construction). In certain cases, the yellow colour is shifted to fluorescent yellow (in the School area sign and Chevron sign).

Mandatory signs are similar to European signs. They are circular with a red border, a white background and a black symbol. Stop sign and Yield sign are as European, except the word "Stop" is changed for "Pare" and the Yield sign has no letters, it is a red triangle with white centre.

Information signs have many shapes and colours. Principally they are blue with white symbols and in many cases these signs have an information letter below the symbol.

===Suriname===
Road signs in Suriname are particularly modelled on the [[Road signs in the Netherlands|Dutch road signs]] since Suriname is a former Dutch colony, although traffic drives on the left.

==Automatic traffic sign recognition==
Cars are beginning to feature cameras with automatic [[traffic sign recognition]], beginning with the [[Opel Insignia]]. It mainly recognizes speed limits and no-overtaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/lifestyle/autos/news/article_1415817.php/Opel_Insignia_to_feature_traffic_sign_recognition_system |title=Opel Insignia to feature traffic sign recognition system |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026074935/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/lifestyle/autos/news/article_1415817.php/Opel_Insignia_to_feature_traffic_sign_recognition_system |archivedate=2010-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{psychoanalysis}}
'''Transference neurosis''' is a term that [[Sigmund Freud]] introduced in 1914 to describe a new form of the [[analysand]]'s infantile [[neurosis]] that develops during the [[psychoanalytic]] process.&lt;ref&gt;(Etchegoyen, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[Dora (case study)|Dora]]'s case history, Freud suggested that during therapy the creation of new symptoms stops, but new versions of the patient's [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] and impulses are generated. He called these newer versions "[[transference]]s" and characterized them as the substitution of the analyst for a person from the patient's past. According to Freud's description: "a whole series of psychological experiences are revived not as belonging to the past, but as applying to the person of the analyst at the present moment".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; When transference neurosis develops, the relationship with the therapist becomes the most important one for the patient, who directs strong infantile feelings and conflicts towards the therapist, e.g. the patient may react as if the analyst is his/her father.&lt;ref name="Chessick, 2002"&gt;Chessick, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic characteristics==

Transference neurosis can be distinguished from other kinds of transference because: 
# It is very vivid and it rekindles the infantile neurosis.
# It is generated by the feelings of frustration that the analysand inevitably experiences during sessions, since the analyst does not fulfill the analysand's longings.
# In transference neurosis the symptoms are not stable, but they are transformed.
# Regression and repetition play a key role in the creation of transference neurosis.
# Transference neurosis reveals the particular meanings that the analysand has given to current infantile relationships and events, which generate internal conflicts between wishes and particular defenses formed to strive against them. These meanings are united and create several transference patterns.&lt;ref name="Chessick, 2002"/&gt;

==Resolution==

Once transference neurosis has developed, it leads to a form of [[psychological resistance|resistance]], called "transference resistance". At this point, the analysis of the transference becomes difficult since new obstacles arise in therapy, e.g. the analysand may insist on fulfilling the infantile wishes that emerged in transference, or may refuse to acknowledge that the current experience is, in fact, a reproduction of a past experience. However, the successful resolution of transference neurosis through interpretation will lead to the lifting of [[repression (psychological)|repression]] and will enable the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Ego]] to solve the infantile conflicts in new ways.&lt;ref name="Chessick, 2002"/&gt; Furthermore, it will allow the analysand to recognize that the current relationship with the analyst is based on repetition of childhood experiences, leading to the detachment of the patient from the analyst.&lt;ref&gt;The Gale group, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The replacement of the infantile neurosis by transference neurosis and its resolution through interpretation remains the main focus of the classical psychoanalytic therapy. In other types of therapy, either the transference neurosis does not develop at all, or it does not play a central role in the therapy process.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, 1994, Shaw, 1991, Tyson, 1996, at Meissner, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is more likely for transference neurosis to develop in psychoanalysis, where the sessions are more frequent, it may also appear during psychotherapy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7201">'''Ulises Carrión''' (1941, San Andres Tuxtla, Mexico - 1989, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), considered as "perhaps Mexico’s most important conceptual artist",&lt;ref name="b"&gt;de la Torre, Monica. (2013 Winter) "[http://bombmagazine.org/article/6931/ulises-carri-n-s-the-poet-s-tongue Ulises Carrión's The Poet's Tongue]" ''BOMB.'' Issue 122. Retrieved 03 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  is widely known for his decisive role in defining and conceptualising the artistic genre artists' book through his manifest ''The New Art of Making Books'' (1975). But his alertness and interest in new forms of art and innovative operations implicated that he was active in most of the artistic fields of his time. The activities cover artworks, theory and independent initiatives. This includes not only a great number of bookworks - as he named artists' books - and unique artworks, but also performances, alongside film, video, and sound works, as well as several edition, publishing, and curating projects, a couple of considerable public projects, and various significant works and initiatives within the international community of mail artists during its most creative period. Equally essential for his artistic career is his engagement in several artists' run spaces. All his artistic activities were reflected by him in highly elaborated theories.&lt;ref name="Schraenen, Guy 1992"&gt;Schraenen, Guy (1992) We have Won! Haven't We?, Exhibition Catalogue, Museum Fodor, Amsterdam, 11-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Carrión was born in San Andres Tuxtla, Veracruz, Mexico in 1941. After studying philosophy and literature at the National University of Mexico,&lt;ref name="c"&gt;Conwell, Donna. (2002) "[http://www.e-flux.com/projects/do_it/notes/essay/e003_text.html Personal Worlds or Cultural Strategies?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021095128/http://www.e-flux.com/projects/do_it/notes/essay/e003_text.html |date=2015-10-21 }}" ''Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil''. Retrieved 03 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; he started his career as a successful and respected young writer. In 1964 he received a grant for further studies at the Sorbonne Paris, France. Short after he went for studies to the Goethe Institute, Achenmühle, Germany, and to Leeds, England, where he studied English language and literature at the University and graduated with a diploma. In 1972 he definitively settled in Amsterdam, an open and cosmopolitan city with a lot of artistic innovation and international exchanges. Here he became co-founder and member of the ''In-Out Center'' (1972-1975). In 1975, he founded ''Other Books and So'', the first space of its kind devoted to all kind of artists’ publications, which in 1979 became the ''Other Books And So Archive''. He was also the co-founder of the ''Vereniging van Videokunstenaars'', later ''Time Based Arts'' (1983-1993) in Amsterdam, NL. Ulises Carrión died in 1989 in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Schraenen, Guy (2016) A Story to Remember. In: Dear Reader. Don't Read., Exhibition catalogue, Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Reception==
Due to a certain cult of the overlooked and underestimated(post-)1960s avant-garde, Ulises Carrión has undergone an extraordinary appreciation in a few years. Exhibitions of his works and a flood of references to his artistic strategies and theories in current art works, essays, conferences, as well as newly annotated, listed, translated, and edited works give proof of the widespread reception today.&lt;ref&gt;Aden, Maike (2017): Carrión Carries On. In: Journal of Artists' Books (JAB), No. 40, Fall 2016, 6-12&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread reception of his manifesto ''The New Art of Making Books''&lt;ref&gt;Carrión, Ulises (1975) The New Art of Making Books, Kontexts (Amsterdam), no. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; made him the central reference for the definition of the concept of the artist book. Also his bookshop gallery ''Other Books and So'' became, despite its short duration, a mythologized paragon. In particular in Latin America, Ulises Carrión is received for some time as an important conceptual compatriot.&lt;ref&gt;Aden, Maike (2016) The Posthumous Reception of Ulises Carrión.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11667">'''Union violence''' is violence committed by unions or union members during labor disputes. When union violence has occurred, it has frequently been in the context of [[industrial unrest]].&lt;ref name="commission1969"&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed.

[[File:Chicago Tribune 1986 strikebreakers.jpg|thumb|200px|Strikebreakers]]

==Overview==
Protests and verbal abuse are routinely aimed against union members or replacement workers who cross picket lines ("blacklegs" or "scabs") during industrial disputes. The inherent aim of a union is to create a labor [[monopoly]] so as to balance the [[monopsony]] a large employer enjoys as a purchaser of labor. [[Strikebreaker]]s threaten that goal and undermine the union's bargaining position, and occasionally this erupts into violent confrontation, with violence committed either by, or against, strikers.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; Some who have sought to explain such violence observe, if labor disputes are accompanied by violence, it may be because labor has no legal redress.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, citing John Bascom, "Civil Law and Social Progress," The Independent, vol. xliv (September 15, 1892), p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, some workers declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
..."the right of employers to manage their own business to suit themselves," is fast coming to mean in effect nothing less than a right to manage the country to suit themselves.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, citing the advisory committee of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers during the Homestead Strike&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Occasionally, violent disputes occur between unions, when one union breaks another's strike.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Research on union violence==
Researchers in industrial relations, criminology, and wider cultural studies have examined violence by workers or trade unions in the context of industrial disputes.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones (1979), Theories of American Labour Violence, Journal of American Studies, 13, pp 245-264, {{doi|10.1017/S0021875800011439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armand J.

[[File:Vector add scale.svg|200px|thumb|right|Vector addition and scalar multiplication: a vector {{math|'''v'''}} (blue) is added to another vector {{math|'''w'''}} (red, upper illustration). Below, '''w''' is stretched by a factor of 2, yielding the sum {{math|'''v''' + 2'''w'''}}.]]

A '''vector space''' (also called a '''linear space''') is a collection of objects called '''vectors''', which may be [[Vector addition|added]] together and [[Scalar multiplication|multiplied]] ("scaled") by numbers, called ''[[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]]''. Scalars are often taken to be [[real number]]s, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by [[complex number]]s, [[rational number]]s, or generally any [[field (mathematics)|field]]. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called ''[[axiom]]s'', listed [[#Definition|below]].

[[Euclidean vector]]s are an example of a vector space.  They represent [[physics|physical]] quantities such as [[force]]s: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a [[force vector]] by a real multiplier is another force vector. In the same vein, but in a more [[geometry|geometric]] sense, vectors representing displacements in the plane or in [[three-dimensional space]] also form vector spaces. Vectors in vector spaces do not necessarily have to be arrow-like objects as they appear in the mentioned examples: vectors are regarded as abstract mathematical objects with particular properties, which in some cases can be visualized as arrows.

Vector spaces are the subject of [[linear algebra]] and are well characterized by their [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]], which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in [[mathematical analysis]], as [[function space]]s, whose vectors are [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a [[topology]], allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and [[continuous function|continuity]]. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] or [[inner product]] are more commonly used, as having a notion of [[metric (mathematics)|distance]] between two vectors. This is particularly the case of [[Banach space]]s and [[Hilbert space]]s, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.

Historically, the first ideas leading to vector spaces can be traced back as far as the 17th century's [[analytic geometry]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], systems of [[linear equation]]s, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by [[Giuseppe Peano]] in 1888, encompasses more general objects than [[Euclidean space]], but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s and their higher-dimensional analogs.

Today, vector spaces are applied throughout [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[engineering]]. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion to deal with [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]]. They offer a framework for [[Fourier series|Fourier expansion]], which is employed in [[image compression]] routines, and they provide an environment that can be used for solution techniques for [[partial differential equation]]s. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, [[coordinate-free]] way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as [[tensor]]s. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of [[manifold (mathematics)|manifolds]] by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and [[abstract algebra]].

{{Algebraic structures |Module}}

== Introduction and definition ==
The concept of vector space will first be explained by describing two particular examples:

===First example: arrows in the plane===
The first example of a vector space consists of [[arrow]]s in a fixed [[plane (geometry)|plane]], starting at one fixed point. This is used in physics to describe [[force]]s or [[velocity|velocities]]. Given any two such arrows, {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}}, the [[parallelogram]] spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at the origin, too. This new arrow is called the ''sum'' of the two arrows and is denoted {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}}. In the special case of two arrows on the same line, their sum is the arrow on this line whose length is the sum or the difference of the lengths, depending on whether the arrows have the same direction. Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling: given any positive [[real number]] {{math|''a''}}, the arrow that has the same direction as {{math|'''v'''}}, but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by {{math|''a''}}, is called ''multiplication'' of {{math|'''v'''}} by {{math|''a''}}. It is denoted {{math|''a'''''v'''}}. When {{math|''a''}} is negative, {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction, instead.

The following shows a few examples: if {{math|1=''a'' = 2}}, the resulting vector {{math|''a'''''w'''}} has the same direction as {{math|'''w'''}}, but is stretched to the double length of {{math|'''w'''}} (right image below). Equivalently, {{math|2'''w'''}} is the sum {{math|'''w''' + '''w'''}}. Moreover, {{math|1=(−1)'''v''' = −'''v'''}} has the opposite direction and the same length as {{math|'''v'''}} (blue vector pointing down in the right image).

|width=50%|[[File:Scalar multiplication.svg|230px|Scalar multiplication: the multiples {{math|−'''v'''}} and {{math|2'''w'''}} are shown.]]
|}

===Second example: ordered pairs of numbers===
A second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}. (The order of the components {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} is significant, so such a pair is also called an [[ordered pair]].) Such a pair is written as {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}. The sum of two such pairs and multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows:
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} + {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} {{math|1== (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}
and 
:{{math|1=''a''&amp;thinsp;(''x'', ''y'') = (''ax'', ''ay'')}}.

The first example above reduces to this one if the arrows are represented by the pair of [[Cartesian coordinates]] of their end points.

===Definition===
In this article, vectors are represented in boldface to distinguish them from scalars.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;It is also common, especially in physics, to denote vectors with an arrow on top: {{math|{{vec|''v''}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}} is a [[set (mathematics)|set]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} together with two operations that satisfy the eight axioms listed below.

* The first operation, called '''vector addition''' or simply '''addition''' {{math| + : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''V''}}, takes any two vectors&amp;nbsp;{{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} and assigns to them a third vector which is commonly written as {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}}, and called the sum of these two vectors. (Note that the resultant vector is also an element of the set {{mvar|V}} ). 
* The second operation, called '''[[scalar multiplication]]''' {{math| · : ''F'' × ''V'' → ''V''}}， takes any scalar&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}} and any vector&amp;nbsp;{{math|'''v'''}} and gives another vector&amp;nbsp;{{math|''a'''''v'''}}. (Similarly, the vector {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is an element of the set {{mvar|V}} ).

Elements of {{mvar|V}} are commonly called ''vectors''. Elements of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|F}} are commonly called ''scalars''.

In the two examples above, the field is the field of the real numbers and the set of the vectors consists of the planar arrows with fixed starting point and of pairs of real numbers, respectively.

To qualify as a vector space, the set&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} and the operations of addition and multiplication must adhere to a number of requirements called [[axiom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the list below, let {{math|'''u'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} be arbitrary vectors in {{mvar|V}}, and {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} scalars in {{mvar|F}}.

{| border="0" style="width:100%;" class="wikitable"
|-
! Axiom || Meaning
|-
| [[Associativity]] of addition || {{math|1='''u''' + ('''v''' + '''w''') = ('''u''' + '''v''') + '''w'''}}
|- style="background:#F8F4FF;"
| [[Commutativity]] of addition || {{math|1='''u''' + '''v''' = '''v''' + '''u'''}}
|-
| [[Identity element]] of addition || There exists an element {{math|'''0''' ∈ ''V''}}, called the ''[[zero vector]]'', such that {{math|1='''v''' + '''0''' = '''v'''}} for all {{math|'''v''' ∈ ''V''}}.
|- style="background:#F8F4FF;"
| [[Inverse element]]s of addition || For every {{math|'''v''' ∈ ''V''}}, there exists an element {{math|−'''v''' ∈ ''V''}}, called the ''[[additive inverse]]'' of {{math|'''v'''}}, such that {{math|1='''v''' + (−'''v''') = '''0'''}}.
|-
| [[Semigroup action|Compatibility]] of scalar multiplication with field multiplication || {{math|1=''a''(''b'''''v''') = (''ab'')'''v'''}} &lt;ref group=nb&gt;This axiom and the next refer to two different operations: scalar multiplication: {{math|''b'''''v'''}}; and field multiplication: {{math|''ab''}}. They do not assert the associativity of either operation. More formally, scalar multiplication is a [[monoid action]] of the multiplicative monoid of the field {{mvar|F}} on the vector space {{mvar|V}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
|- style="background:#F8F4FF;"
| Identity element of scalar multiplication ||  {{math|1=1'''v''' = '''v'''}}, where {{math|1}} denotes the [[multiplicative identity]] in {{mvar|F}}.
|-
| [[Distributivity]] of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;|| {{math|1=''a''('''u''' + '''v''') = ''a'''''u''' + ''a'''''v'''}}
|- style="background:#F8F4FF;"
| Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition || {{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')'''v''' = ''a'''''v''' + ''b'''''v'''}}
|}

These axioms generalize properties of the vectors introduced in the above examples. Indeed, the result of addition of two ordered pairs (as in the second example above) does not depend on the order of the summands:
:{{math|1=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.
Likewise, in the geometric example of vectors as arrows, {{math|1='''v''' + '''w''' = '''w''' + '''v'''}} since the parallelogram defining the sum of the vectors is independent of the order of the vectors. All other axioms can be checked in a similar manner in both examples. Thus, by disregarding the concrete nature of the particular type of vectors, the definition incorporates these two and many more examples in one notion of vector space.

Subtraction of two vectors and division by a (non-zero) scalar can be defined as
:{{math|1='''v''' − '''w''' = '''v''' + (−'''w''')}},
:{{math|1='''v'''/''a'' = (1/''a'')'''v'''}}.

When the scalar field {{mvar|F}} is the [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, the vector space is called a ''real vector space''. When the scalar field is the [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}}, the vector space is called a ''complex vector space''. These two cases are the ones used most often in engineering. The general definition of a vector space allows scalars to be elements of any fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}}. The notion is then known as an {{mvar|F}}-''vector spaces'' or a ''vector space over {{mvar|F}}''. A field is, essentially, a set of numbers possessing [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] operations.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Some authors (such as {{Harvard citations|last = Brown|year = 1991|nb=yes}}) restrict attention to the fields {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}, but most of the theory is unchanged for an arbitrary field.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[rational number]]s form a field.

In contrast to the intuition stemming from vectors in the plane and higher-dimensional cases, there is, in general vector spaces, no notion of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]], [[angle]]s or [[distance]]s. To deal with such matters, particular types of vector spaces are introduced; see [[#Vector spaces with additional structure|below]].

===Alternative formulations and elementary consequences===
Vector addition and scalar multiplication are operations, satisfying the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] property:  {{math|'''u''' + '''v'''}} and {{math|''a'''''v'''}} are in {{math|''V''}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, and {{math|'''u'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} in {{math|''V''}}. Some older sources mention these properties as separate axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = van der Waerden|year = 1993|nb = yes|loc=Ch. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the parlance of [[abstract algebra]], the first four axioms are equivalent to requiring the set of vectors to be an [[abelian group]] under addition. The remaining axioms give this group an {{math|''F''}}-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] structure. In other words, there is a [[ring homomorphism]] {{math|''f''}} from the field {{math|''F''}} into the [[endomorphism ring]] of the group of vectors. Then scalar multiplication {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is defined as {{math|(''f''(''a''))('''v''')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Bourbaki|year=1998|nb=yes|loc=§II.1.1}}. Bourbaki calls the group homomorphisms {{math|''f''(''a'')}} ''homotheties''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of direct consequences of the vector space axioms. Some of them derive from [[elementary group theory]], applied to the additive group of vectors: for example, the zero vector {{math|'''0'''}} of {{math|''V''}} and the additive inverse {{math|−'''v'''}} of any vector {{math|'''v'''}} are unique. Further properties follow by employing also the distributive law for the scalar multiplication, for example {{math|''a'''''v'''}} equals {{math|'''0'''}} if and only if {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|0}} or {{math|'''v'''}} equals {{math|'''0'''}}.

==History==
Vector spaces stem from [[affine geometry]] via the introduction of [[coordinate]]s in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] founded [[analytic geometry]] by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane [[curve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1969|nb = yes|loc = ch. "Algèbre linéaire et algèbre multilinéaire", pp. 78–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804, to achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]] introduced certain operations on points, lines and planes, which are predecessors of vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bolzano|year = 1804|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was then used in the conception of [[Barycentric coordinate system (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] by [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Möbius|year = 1827|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828 [[C. V. Mourey]] suggested the existence of an algebra surpassing not only ordinary algebra but also two-dimensional algebra created by him searching a geometrical interpretation of complex numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A History of Vector Analysis: The Evolution of the Idea of a Vectorial System |last1=Crowe |first1=Michel J. |year=1994 |publisher=Dover |isbn= 0-486-67910-1 |page=11 and 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of vectors was founded on [[Giusto Bellavitis|Bellavitis]]' notion of the bipoint, an oriented segment of which one end is the origin and the other a target, then further elaborated with the presentation of [[complex number]]s by [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]] and [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] and the introduction of [[quaternion]]s and [[biquaternion]]s by the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Hamilton|year = 1853|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are elements in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;}}; their treatment as [[linear combination]]s can be traced back to [[Edmond Laguerre|Laguerre]] in 1867, who also defined [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]].

In 1857, [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] introduced [[matrix notation]], which allows for a harmonization and simplification of [[linear map]]s. Around the same time, [[Hermann Grassmann|Grassmann]] studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Grassmann|year = 1844|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, the concepts of [[linear independence]] and [[dimension]], as well as [[scalar product]]s, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work extended a vector space of ''n'' dimensions to one of 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; dimensions by consideration of 2-vectors &lt;math&gt;u \wedge v&lt;/math&gt; and 3-vectors &lt;math&gt;u \wedge v \wedge w&lt;/math&gt; called [[multivector]]s. This extension, called [[multilinear algebra]], is governed by the rules of [[exterior algebra]]. [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Peano|year = 1888|nb = yes |loc = ch. IX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important development of vector spaces is due to the construction of [[function space]]s by [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]]. This was later formalized by [[Stefan Banach|Banach]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], around 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Banach|year = 1922|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, [[algebra]] and the new field of [[functional analysis]] began to interact, notably with key concepts such as [[Lp space|spaces of ''p''-integrable functions]] and [[Hilbert space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Dorier|year = 1995|nb = yes}}, {{Harvard citations|last = Moore|year = 1995|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.

== Examples ==
{{main|Examples of vector spaces}}

===Coordinate spaces===
{{Main|Coordinate space}}
The simplest example of a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} is the field itself, equipped with its standard addition and multiplication. More generally, a vector space can be composed of
[[tuple|''n''-tuples]] (sequences of length {{math|''n''}}) of elements of {{math|''F''}}, such as
:{{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where each {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an element of {{math|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. I.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A vector space composed of all the {{math|''n''}}-tuples of a field {{math|''F''}} is known as a ''[[coordinate space]]'', usually denoted {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The case {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} is the above-mentioned simplest example, in which the field {{math|''F''}} is also regarded as a vector space over itself. The case {{math|1=''F'' = '''R'''}} and {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} was discussed in the introduction above.

===Complex numbers and other field extensions===
The set of [[complex numbers]] {{math|'''C'''}}, i.e., numbers that can be written in the form {{math|1=''x'' + ''iy''}} for [[real numbers]] {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} where {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], form a vector space over the reals with the usual addition and multiplication: {{math|1=(''x'' + ''iy'') + (''a'' + ''ib'') = (''x'' + ''a'') + ''i''(''y'' + ''b'')}} and {{math|1=''c'' ⋅ (''x'' + ''iy'') = (''c'' ⋅ ''x'') + ''i''(''c'' ⋅ ''y'')}} for real numbers {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}.  The various axioms of a vector space follow from the fact that the same rules hold for complex number arithmetic.

In fact, the example of complex numbers is essentially the same (i.e., it is ''isomorphic'') to the vector space of ordered pairs of real numbers mentioned above: if we think of the complex number {{math|''x'' + ''i'' ''y''}} as representing the ordered pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} in the [[complex plane]] then we see that the rules for sum and scalar product correspond exactly to those in the earlier example.

More generally, [[field extension]]s provide another class of examples of vector spaces, particularly in algebra and [[algebraic number theory]]: a field {{math|''F''}} containing a [[Field extension|smaller field]] {{math|''E''}} is an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, by the given multiplication and addition operations of {{math|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year =2002|loc = ch. V.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the complex numbers are a vector space over {{math|'''R'''}}, and the field extension &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}(i\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}}.  &lt;!--A particularly interesting type of field extension in [[number theory]] is {{math|'''Q'''(''α'')}}, the extension of the rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} by a fixed complex number {{math|''α''}}. {{math|'''Q'''(''α'')}} is the smallest field containing the rationals and a fixed complex number ''α''. Its dimension as a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}} depends on the choice of {{math|''α''}}.--&gt;

===Function spaces===
{{Main|Function space}}
Functions from any fixed set {{math|Ω}} to a field {{math|''F''}} also form vector spaces, by performing addition and scalar multiplication pointwise. That is, the sum of two functions {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} is the function {{math|(''f'' + ''g'')}} given by
:{{math|1=(''f'' + ''g'')(''w'') = ''f''(''w'') + ''g''(''w'')}},
and similarly for multiplication. Such function spaces occur in many geometric situations, when {{math|Ω}} is the [[real line]] or an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], or other [[subset]]s of {{math|'''R'''}}. Many notions in topology and analysis, such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[integral|integrability]] or [[differentiability]] are well-behaved with respect to linearity: sums and scalar multiples of functions possessing such a property still have that property.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = ch. XII.3., p. 335|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the set of such functions are vector spaces. They are studied in greater detail using the methods of [[functional analysis]], see [[#labelFunctionalAnalysis|below]]. Algebraic constraints also yield vector spaces: the &lt;cite id=labelPolynomialRing&gt;[[polynomial ring|vector space {{math|''F''[x]}}]]&lt;/cite&gt; is given by [[polynomial function]]s:
:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ... + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where the [[coefficient]]s {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are in {{math|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. IX.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear equations===
{{Main|Linear equation|Linear differential equation|Systems of linear equations}}
Systems of [[homogeneous linear equation]]s are closely tied to vector spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. VI.3.|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the solutions of 
:{|
|-
| style="text-align:right;"|{{math|''a''}}
|{{math|+}}
|{{math|3''b''}}
|{{math|+}}
| style="text-align:right;"|{{math|''c''}}
|{{math|{{=}} 0}}
|-
|{{math|4''a''}}
|{{math|+}}
|{{math|2''b''}}
|{{math|+}}
|{{math|2''c''}}
|{{math|{{=}} 0}}
|}
are given by triples with arbitrary {{math|''a''}}, {{math|1=''b'' = ''a''/2}}, and {{math|1=''c'' = −5''a''/2}}. They form a vector space: sums and scalar multiples of such triples still satisfy the same ratios of the three variables; thus they are solutions, too. [[matrix (mathematics)|Matrices]] can be used to condense multiple linear equations as above into one vector equation, namely
:&lt;cite id=equation3&gt;{{math|1=''A'''''x''' = '''0'''}}&lt;/cite&gt;,
where {{math|1=''A'' =}} &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
4 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix containing the coefficients of the given equations, {{math|'''x'''}} is the vector {{math|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}}, {{math|''A'''''x'''}} denotes the [[matrix product]], and {{math|1='''0''' = (0, 0)}} is the zero vector. In a similar vein, the solutions of homogeneous ''linear differential equations'' form vector spaces. For example,
:&lt;cite id=equation1&gt;{{math|1=''f''′′(''x'') + 2''f''′(''x'') + ''f''(''x'') = 0}}&lt;/cite&gt;
yields {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''a&amp;thinsp;e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx&amp;thinsp;e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary constants, and {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[natural exponential function]].

== Basis and dimension ==
{{Main|basis (linear algebra)|l1=Basis|dimension (linear algebra)|l2=Dimension}}
[[File:Vector components and base change.svg|A vector {{math|'''v'''}} in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (blue) expressed in terms of different bases: using the [[standard basis]] of {{math|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; '''v''' = ''x'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (black), and using a different, non-[[orthogonal vector|orthogonal]] basis: {{math|1='''v''' = '''f'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''f'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (red).|thumb|200px]]
&lt;cite id=label1&gt;''Bases''&lt;/cite&gt; allow one to represent vectors by a [[sequence]] of scalars called ''coordinates'' or ''components''. A basis is a (finite or infinite) set {{math|1=''B'' = {'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈ ''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of vectors {{math|'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, for convenience often indexed by some [[index set]] {{math|''I''}}, that spans the whole space and is [[linearly independent]]. "Spanning the whole space" means that any vector {{math|'''v'''}} can be expressed as a finite sum (called a ''[[linear combination]]'') of the basis elements:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = a_1 \mathbf{b}_{i_1} + a_2 \mathbf{b}_{i_2} + \cdots + a_n \mathbf{b}_{i_n},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationNote|1}}}}
where the {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are scalars, called the coordinates (or the components) of the vector {{math|'''v'''}} with respect to the basis {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} {{math|1=(''k'' = 1, ..., ''n'')}} elements of {{math|''B''}}. Linear independence means that the coordinates {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are uniquely determined for any vector in the vector space.

For example, the [[coordinate vector]]s {{math|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (1, 0, ..., 0)}}, {{math|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0)}}, to {{math|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 0, ..., 0, 1)}}, form a basis of {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, called the [[standard basis]], since any vector {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these vectors:
:{{math|1=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1, 0, ..., 0) + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0, 1, 0, ..., 0) + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0, ..., 0, 1) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
The corresponding coordinates {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|...}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are just the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the vector.

Every vector space has a basis. This follows from [[Zorn's lemma]], an equivalent formulation of the [[Axiom of Choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 1.9, p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the other axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the existence of bases is equivalent to the axiom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Blass|year = 1984|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ultrafilter lemma]], which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or [[cardinality]] (cf. ''[[Dimension theorem for vector spaces]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Halpern|year = 1966|nb = yes|loc=pp. 670–673}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is called the ''dimension'' of the vector space, denoted by dim ''V''. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Artin|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 3.3.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimension of the coordinate space {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{math|''n''}}, by the basis exhibited above. The dimension of the polynomial ring ''F''[''x''] introduced [[#labelPolynomialRing|above]] is [[countably infinite]], a basis is given by {{math|1}}, {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|...}} [[A fortiori]], the dimension of more general function spaces, such as the space of functions on some (bounded or unbounded) interval, is infinite.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The [[indicator function]]s of intervals (of which there are infinitely many) are linearly independent, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; Under suitable regularity assumptions on the coefficients involved, the dimension of the solution space of a homogeneous [[ordinary differential equation]] equals the degree of the equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Braun|year = 1993|nb = yes|loc=Th. 3.4.5, p. 291}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the solution space for the [[#equation1|above equation]] is generated by {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''xe''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. These two functions are linearly independent over {{math|'''R'''}}, so the dimension of this space is two, as is the degree of the equation.

A field extension over the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} can be thought of as a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}} (by defining vector addition as field addition, defining scalar multiplication as field multiplication by elements of {{math|'''Q'''}}, and otherwise ignoring the field multiplication). The dimension (or [[degree of a field extension|degree]]) of the field extension {{math|'''Q'''(α)}} over {{math|'''Q'''}} depends on {{math|α}}. If {{math|α}} satisfies some polynomial equation
&lt;math display=block&gt; q_n \alpha^n + q_{n - 1} \alpha^{n - 1} + \ldots + q_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
with rational coefficients {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} (in other words, if α is [[algebraic number|algebraic]]), the dimension is finite. More precisely, it equals the degree of the [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] having α as a [[root of a function|root]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Stewart|year = 1975|nb = yes|loc=Proposition 4.3, p. 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the complex numbers '''C''' are a two-dimensional real vector space, generated by 1 and the [[imaginary unit]] ''i''. The latter satisfies ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 0, an equation of degree two. Thus, '''C''' is a two-dimensional '''R'''-vector space (and, as any field, one-dimensional as a vector space over itself, '''C'''). If α is not algebraic, the dimension of '''Q'''(α) over '''Q''' is infinite. For instance, for α = [[pi|π]] there is no such equation, in other words π is [[transcendental number|transcendental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Stewart|year = 1975|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 6.5, p. 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linear maps and matrices==
{{Main|Linear map}}
The relation of two vector spaces can be expressed by ''linear map'' or ''linear transformation''. They are [[function (mathematics)|functions]] that reflect the vector space structure—i.e., they preserve sums and scalar multiplication:
:''f''('''x''' + '''y''') = ''f''('''x''') + ''f''('''y''') and ''f''(''a'' &amp;middot; '''x''') = ''a'' &amp;middot; ''f''('''x''') for all '''x''' and '''y''' in ''V'', all ''a'' in ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 2, p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[isomorphism]]'' is a linear map {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} such that there exists an [[inverse map]] {{math|''g'' : ''W'' → ''V''}}, which is a map such that the two possible [[function composition|compositions]] {{math|''f'' ∘ ''g'' : ''W'' → ''W''}} and {{math|''g'' ∘ ''f'' : ''V'' → ''V''}} are [[Identity function|identity maps]]. Equivalently, ''f'' is both one-to-one ([[injective]]) and onto ([[surjective]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IV.4, Corollary, p. 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If there exists an isomorphism between ''V'' and ''W'', the two spaces are said to be ''isomorphic''; they are then essentially identical as vector spaces, since all identities holding in ''V'' are, via ''f'', transported to similar ones in ''W'', and vice versa via ''g''.

[[File:Vector components.svg|180px|right|thumb|Describing an arrow vector '''v''' by its coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' yields an isomorphism of vector spaces.]]
For example, the "arrows in the plane" and "ordered pairs of numbers" vector spaces in the introduction are isomorphic: a planar arrow '''v''' departing at the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] of some (fixed) [[coordinate system]] can be expressed as an ordered pair by considering the ''x''- and ''y''-component of the arrow, as shown in the image at the right. Conversely, given a pair (''x'', ''y''), the arrow going by ''x'' to the right (or to the left, if ''x'' is negative), and ''y'' up (down, if ''y'' is negative) turns back the arrow '''v'''.

Linear maps ''V'' → ''W'' between two vector spaces form a vector space Hom&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'', ''W''), also denoted L(''V'', ''W'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Example IV.2.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space of linear maps from ''V'' to ''F'' is called the ''[[dual vector space]]'', denoted ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. VI.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Via the injective [[natural (category theory)|natural]] map {{math|''V'' → ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, any vector space can be embedded into its ''bidual''; the map is an isomorphism if and only if the space is finite-dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Halmos|year =1974|nb = yes|loc=p. 28, Ex. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a basis of {{math|''V''}} is chosen, linear maps {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} are completely determined by specifying the images of the basis vectors, because any element of ''V'' is expressed uniquely as a linear combination of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Theorem IV.2.1, p. 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|1=dim ''V'' = dim ''W''}}, a [[bijection|1-to-1 correspondence]] between fixed bases of {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} gives rise to a linear map that maps any basis element of {{math|''V''}} to the corresponding basis element of {{math|''W''}}. It is an isomorphism, by its very definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Th. 2.5 and 2.6, p. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, two vector spaces are isomorphic if their dimensions agree and vice versa. Another way to express this is that any vector space is ''completely classified'' ([[up to]] isomorphism) by its dimension, a single number. In particular, any ''n''-dimensional {{math|''F''}}-vector space {{math|''V''}} is isomorphic to {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. There is, however, no "canonical" or preferred isomorphism; actually an isomorphism {{math|''φ'' : ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''V''}} is equivalent to the choice of a basis of {{math|''V''}}, by mapping the standard basis of {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|''V''}}, via {{math|''φ''}}. The freedom of choosing a convenient basis is particularly useful in the infinite-dimensional context; see [[#basis in inf dim context|below]].

===Matrices===
{{Main|Matrix (mathematics)|l1=Matrix|Determinant}}
[[Image:Matrix.svg|right|thumb|200px|A typical matrix]]
''Matrices'' are a useful notion to encode linear maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. V.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are written as a rectangular array of scalars as in the image at the right. Any ''m''-by-''n'' matrix ''A'' gives rise to a linear map from ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, by the following
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) \mapsto \left(\sum_{j=1}^n a_{1j}x_j, \sum_{j=1}^n a_{2j}x_j, \cdots, \sum_{j=1}^n a_{mj}x_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sum&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[summation]],
or, using the [[matrix multiplication]] of the matrix {{math|''A''}} with the coordinate vector {{math|'''x'''}}:
:&lt;cite id=equation2&gt;{{math|'''x''' ↦ ''A'''''x'''}}&lt;/cite&gt;.
Moreover, after choosing bases of {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}}, ''any'' linear map {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} is uniquely represented by a matrix via this assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. V.3., Corollary, p. 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Determinant parallelepiped.svg|200px|right|thumb|The volume of this [[parallelepiped]] is the absolute value of the determinant of the 3-by-3 matrix formed by the vectors {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.]]
The [[determinant]] {{math|det (''A'')}} of a [[square matrix]] {{math|''A''}} is a scalar that tells whether the associated map is an isomorphism or not: to be so it is sufficient and necessary that the determinant is nonzero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Theorem VII.9.8, p. 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linear transformation of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} corresponding to a real ''n''-by-''n'' matrix is [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation preserving]] if and only if its determinant is positive.

===Eigenvalues and eigenvectors===
{{Main|Eigenvalues and eigenvectors}}
[[Endomorphism]]s, linear maps {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''V''}}, are particularly important since in this case vectors {{math|'''v'''}} can be compared with their image under {{math|''f''}}, {{math|''f''('''v''')}}. Any nonzero vector {{math|'''v'''}} satisfying {{math|1=''λ'''''v''' = ''f''('''v''')}}, where {{math|''λ''}} is a scalar, is called an ''eigenvector'' of {{math|''f''}} with ''eigenvalue'' {{math|''λ''}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The nomenclature derives from [[German language|German]] "[[wikt:eigen|eigen]]", which means own or proper.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 8, p. 135–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, {{math|'''v'''}} is an element of the [[Kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] of the difference {{math|''f'' − ''λ'' · Id}} (where Id is the [[identity function|identity map]] {{math|''V'' → ''V'')}}. If {{math|''V''}} is finite-dimensional, this can be rephrased using determinants: {{math|''f''}} having eigenvalue {{math|''λ''}} is equivalent to
:{{math|1=det(''f'' − ''λ'' · Id) = 0}}.
By spelling out the definition of the determinant, the expression on the left hand side can be seen to be a polynomial function in {{math|''λ''}}, called the [[characteristic polynomial]] of {{math|''f''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IX.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the field {{math|''F''}} is large enough to contain a zero of this polynomial (which automatically happens for {{math|''F''}} [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], such as {{math|1=''F'' = '''C'''}}) any linear map has at least one eigenvector. The vector space {{math|''V''}} may or may not possess an [[eigenbasis]], a basis consisting of eigenvectors. This phenomenon is governed by the [[Jordan canonical form]] of the map.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 8, p. 140}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = nb&gt; See also [[Jordan–Chevalley decomposition]].&lt;/ref&gt; The set of all eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of {{math|''f''}} forms a vector space known as the ''eigenspace'' corresponding to the eigenvalue (and {{math|''f''}}) in question. To achieve the [[spectral theorem]], the corresponding statement in the infinite-dimensional case, the machinery of functional analysis is needed, see [[#labelSpectralTheorem|below]].

==Basic constructions==
In addition to the above concrete examples, there are a number of standard linear algebraic constructions that yield vector spaces related to given ones. In addition to the definitions given below, they are also characterized by [[universal property|universal properties]], which determine an object {{math|''X''}} by specifying the linear maps from {{math|''X''}} to any other vector space.

===Subspaces and quotient spaces===
{{Main|Linear subspace|Quotient vector space}}
[[File:Linear subspaces with shading.svg|thumb|250px|right|A line passing through the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] (blue, thick) in [[Euclidean space|{{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] is a linear subspace. It is the intersection of two [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] (green and yellow).]]

A nonempty [[subset]] ''W'' of a vector space ''V'' that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the '''0'''-vector of ''V'') is called a ''linear subspace'' of ''V'', or simply a ''subspace'' of ''V'', when the ambient space is unambiguously a vector space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This is typically the case when a vector space is also considered as an [[affine space]]. In this case, a linear subspace contains the [[zero vector]], while an affine subspace does not necessarily contain it.&lt;/ref&gt; Subspaces of ''V'' are vector spaces (over the same field) in their own right. The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set ''S'' of vectors is called its [[linear span|span]], and it is the smallest subspace of ''V'' containing the set ''S''. Expressed in terms of elements, the span is the subspace consisting of all the [[linear combination]]s of elements of ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|vector line|vector plane|vector hyperplane}}A linear subspace of dimension 1 is a '''vector line'''.  A linear subspace of dimension 2 is a '''vector plane'''. A linear subspace that contains all elements but one of a basis of the ambient space is a '''vector hyperplane'''. In a vector space of finite dimension {{math|''n''}}, a vector hyperplane is thus a subspace of dimension {{math|''n'' – 1}}.

The counterpart to subspaces are ''quotient vector spaces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 3, p. 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given any subspace {{math|''W'' ⊂ ''V''}}, the quotient space ''V''/''W'' ("''V'' [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''W''") is defined as follows: as a set, it consists of {{math|1='''v''' + ''W'' = {'''v''' + '''w''' : '''w''' ∈ ''W''},}} where '''v''' is an arbitrary vector in ''V''. The sum of two such elements {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W''}} and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W''}} is {{math|('''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''W'',}} and scalar multiplication is given by {{math|1=''a'' · ('''v''' + ''W'') = (''a'' · '''v''') + ''W''}}. The key point in this definition is that {{math|1='''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W'' = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W''}} [[if and only if]] the difference of '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lies in ''W''.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Some authors (such as {{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes}}) choose to start with this [[equivalence relation]] and derive the concrete shape of ''V''/''W'' from this.&lt;/ref&gt; This way, the quotient space "forgets" information that is contained in the subspace ''W''.

The [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] ker(''f'') of a linear map {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} consists of vectors '''v''' that are mapped to '''0''' in ''W''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IV.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both kernel and [[image (mathematics)|image]] {{math|1=im(''f'') = {''f''('''v''') : '''v''' ∈ ''V''} }} are subspaces of ''V'' and ''W'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 2, p. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of kernels and images is part of the statement that the [[category of vector spaces]] (over a fixed field ''F'') is an [[abelian category]], i.e. a corpus of mathematical objects and structure-preserving maps between them (a [[category (mathematics)|category]]) that behaves much like the [[category of abelian groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Mac Lane|year = 1998|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, many statements such as the [[first isomorphism theorem]] (also called [[rank–nullity theorem]] in matrix-related terms)
:''V'' / ker(''f'') ≡ im(''f'').
and the second and third isomorphism theorem can be formulated and proven in a way very similar to the corresponding statements for [[group (mathematics)|groups]].

An important example is the kernel of a linear map {{math|'''x''' ↦ ''A'''''x'''}} for some fixed matrix ''A'', as [[#equation2|above]]. The kernel of this map is the subspace of vectors '''x''' such that {{math|1=''A'''''x''' = 0}}, which is precisely the set of solutions to the system of homogeneous linear equations belonging to ''A''. This concept also extends to linear differential equations
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 f + a_1 \frac{d f}{d x} + a_2 \frac{d^2 f}{d x^2} + \cdots + a_n \frac{d^n f}{d x^n} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where the coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are functions in ''x'', too.
In the corresponding map
:&lt;math&gt;f \mapsto D(f) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i \frac{d^i f}{d x^i}&lt;/math&gt;,
the [[derivative]]s of the function ''f'' appear linearly (as opposed to ''f''′′(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, for example). Since differentiation is a linear procedure (i.e., {{math|1=(''f'' + ''g'')′ = ''f''′ + ''g''&amp;thinsp;′}} and {{math|1=(''c''·''f'')′ = ''c''·''f''′}} for a constant {{math|''c''}}) this assignment is linear, called a [[linear differential operator]]. In particular, the solutions to the differential equation {{math|1=''D''(''f'') = 0}} form a vector space (over {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}).

===Direct product and direct sum===
{{Main|Direct product|Direct sum of modules}}
The ''direct product'' of vector spaces and the ''direct sum'' of vector spaces are two ways of combining an indexed family of vector spaces into a new vector space.

The ''direct product''&lt;!--explain direct--&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\prod_{i \in I} V_i}&lt;/math&gt; of a family of vector spaces ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of the set of all tuples ({{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈ ''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which specify for each index ''i'' in some [[index set]] ''I'' an element '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, pp. 31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addition and scalar multiplication is performed componentwise. A variant of this construction is the ''direct sum'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus_{i \in I} V_i&lt;/math&gt; (also called [[coproduct]] and denoted &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\coprod_{i \in I}V_i}&lt;/math&gt;), where only tuples with finitely many nonzero vectors are allowed. If the index set ''I'' is finite, the two constructions agree, but in general they are different.

===Tensor product===
{{Main|Tensor product of vector spaces}}
The ''tensor product'' {{math|''V'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; ''W''}}, or simply {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}}, of two vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'' is one of the central notions of [[multilinear algebra]] which deals with extending notions such as linear maps to several variables. A map {{math|''g'' : [[Cartesian product|''V'' × ''W'']] → ''X''}} is called [[bilinear map|bilinear]] if ''g'' is linear in both variables '''v''' and '''w'''.  That is to say, for fixed '''w''' the map {{math|'''v''' ↦ ''g''('''v''', '''w''')}} is linear in the sense above and likewise for fixed '''v'''.

The tensor product is a particular vector space that is a ''universal'' recipient of bilinear maps ''g'', as follows. It is defined as the vector space consisting of finite (formal) sums of symbols called [[tensor]]s
:'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,
subject to the rules 
: ''a'' &amp;middot; ('''v''' ⊗ '''w''') = (''a'' &amp;middot; '''v''') ⊗ '''w''' = '''v''' ⊗ (''a'' &amp;middot; '''w'''), where ''a'' is a scalar,
:('''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊗ '''w''' = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w''' + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w''', and
:'''v''' ⊗ ('''w'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''v''' ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v''' ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = ch. XVI.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Universal tensor prod.svg|right|thumb|200px|[[Commutative diagram]] depicting the universal property of the tensor product.]]
These rules ensure that the map ''f'' from the {{math|''V'' × ''W''}} to {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}} that maps a [[tuple]] {{math|('''v''', '''w''')}} to {{math|'''v''' ⊗ '''w'''}} is bilinear. The universality states that given ''any'' vector space ''X'' and ''any'' bilinear map {{math|''g'' : ''V'' × ''W'' → ''X''}}, there exists a unique map ''u'', shown in the diagram with a dotted arrow, whose [[function composition|composition]] with ''f'' equals ''g'': {{math|1=''u''('''v''' ⊗ '''w''') = ''g''('''v''', '''w''')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Th. 14.3}}. See also [[Yoneda lemma]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the [[universal property]] of the tensor product, an instance of the method—much used in advanced abstract algebra—to indirectly define objects by specifying maps from or to this object.

==Vector spaces with additional structure==
From the point of view of linear algebra, vector spaces are completely understood insofar as any vector space is characterized, up to isomorphism, by its dimension. However, vector spaces ''per se'' do not offer a framework to deal with the question—crucial to analysis—whether a sequence of functions [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] to another function. Likewise, linear algebra is not adapted to deal with [[infinite series]], since the addition operation allows only finitely many terms to be added. &lt;cite id=labelFunctionalAnalysis&gt;Therefore, the needs of [[functional analysis]] require considering additional structures.&lt;/cite&gt;

A vector space may be given a [[partial order]] ≤, under which some vectors can be compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Schaefer|last2=Wolff|year = 1999|loc = pp. 204–205|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''n''-dimensional real space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; can be ordered by comparing its vectors componentwise. [[Ordered vector space]]s, for example [[Riesz space]]s, are fundamental to [[Lebesgue integration]], which relies on the ability to express a function as a difference of two positive functions
:''f'' = ''f''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; − ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;,
where ''f''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the positive part of ''f'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; the negative part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 2004|nb = yes|loc=ch. 2, p. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normed vector spaces and inner product spaces===
{{Main|Normed vector space|Inner product space}}
"Measuring" vectors is done by specifying a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], a datum which measures lengths of vectors, or by an [[inner product]], which measures angles between vectors. Norms and inner products are denoted &lt;math&gt;| \mathbf v|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf v , \mathbf w \rang&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The datum of an inner product entails that lengths of vectors can be defined too, by defining the associated norm &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf v| := \sqrt {\langle \mathbf v , \mathbf v \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;. Vector spaces endowed with such data are known as ''normed vector spaces'' and ''inner product spaces'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last =Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordinate space ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; can be equipped with the standard [[dot product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x , \mathbf y \rang = \mathbf x \cdot \mathbf y = x_1 y_1 + \cdots + x_n y_n.&lt;/math&gt;
In '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, this reflects the common notion of the angle between two vectors '''x''' and '''y''', by the [[law of cosines]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf y = \cos\left(\angle (\mathbf x, \mathbf y)\right) \cdot |\mathbf x| \cdot |\mathbf y|.&lt;/math&gt;
Because of this, two vectors satisfying &lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x , \mathbf y \rang = 0&lt;/math&gt; are called [[orthogonal]]. An important variant of the standard dot product is used in [[Minkowski space]]: '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; endowed with the Lorentz product
:&lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x | \mathbf y \rang = x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_3 - x_4 y_4.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last =Naber|year = 2003|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast to the standard dot product, it is not [[positive definite bilinear form|positive definite]]: &lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x | \mathbf x \rang&lt;/math&gt; also takes negative values, for example for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x = (0, 0, 0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;. Singling out the fourth coordinate—[[timelike|corresponding to time]], as opposed to three space-dimensions—makes it useful for the mathematical treatment of [[special relativity]].

===Topological vector spaces===
{{Main|Topological vector space}}
Convergence questions are treated by considering vector spaces ''V'' carrying a compatible [[topological space|topology]], a structure that allows one to talk about elements being [[neighborhood (topology)|close to each other]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1987|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compatible here means that addition and scalar multiplication have to be [[continuous map]]s.  Roughly, if '''x''' and '''y''' in ''V'', and ''a'' in ''F'' vary by a bounded amount, then so do {{math|'''x''' + '''y'''}} and {{math|''a'''''x'''}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This requirement implies that the topology gives rise to a [[uniform structure]], {{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1989|loc = ch. II|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make sense of specifying the amount a scalar changes, the field ''F'' also has to carry a topology in this context; a common choice are the reals or the complex numbers.

In such ''topological vector spaces'' one can consider [[series (mathematics)|series]] of vectors.  The [[infinite sum]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f_i&lt;/math&gt;
denotes the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the corresponding finite partial sums of the sequence (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; of elements of ''V''. For example, the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; could be (real or complex) functions belonging to some [[function space]] ''V'', in which case the series is a [[function series]]. The [[modes of convergence|mode of convergence]] of the series depends on the topology imposed on the function space. In such cases, [[pointwise convergence]] and [[uniform convergence]] are two prominent examples.

[[Image:Vector norms2.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Unit ball|Unit "spheres"]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; consist of plane vectors of norm 1.  Depicted are the unit spheres in different [[Lp norm|''p''-norm]]s, for ''p'' = 1, 2, and ∞. The bigger diamond depicts points of 1-norm equal to 2.]]
A way to ensure the existence of limits of certain infinite series is to restrict attention to spaces where any [[Cauchy sequence]] has a limit; such a vector space is called [[Completeness (topology)|complete]]. Roughly, a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits. For example, the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval [0,1], equipped with the [[topology of uniform convergence]] is not complete because any continuous function on [0,1] can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials, by the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§4.11-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the space of ''all'' continuous functions on [0,1] with the same topology is complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§1.5-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A norm gives rise to a topology by defining that a sequence of vectors '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges to '''v''' if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\text{lim}_{n \rightarrow \infty} |\mathbf v_n - \mathbf v| = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Banach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given, respectively, by a norm and an inner product. Their study—a key piece of [[functional analysis]]—focusses on infinite-dimensional vector spaces, since all norms on finite-dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last =Choquet|year = 1966|nb = yes|loc=Proposition III.7.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image at the right shows the equivalence of the 1-norm and ∞-norm on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: as the unit "balls" enclose each other, a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm. In the infinite-dimensional case, however, there will generally be inequivalent topologies, which makes the study of topological vector spaces richer than that of vector spaces without additional data.

From a conceptual point of view, all notions related to topological vector spaces should match the topology. For example, instead of considering all linear maps (also called [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s) {{math|''V'' → ''W''}}, maps between topological vector spaces are required to be continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=p. 34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the &lt;cite id=label2&gt;(topological) dual space {{math|''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/cite&gt; consists of continuous functionals {{math|''V'' → '''R'''}} (or to {{math|'''C'''}}). The fundamental [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] is concerned with separating subspaces of appropriate topological vector spaces by continuous functionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year =1983|nb = yes|loc=Cor. 4.1.2, p. 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Banach spaces====
{{Main|Banach space}}
''Banach spaces'', introduced by [[Stefan Banach]], are complete normed vector spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=ch. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A first example is [[Lp space|the vector space &lt;math&gt;\ell^{p}&lt;/math&gt;]] 
consisting of infinite vectors with real entries 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n},\ldots\right)&lt;/math&gt;
whose [[p-norm|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-norm]] 
&lt;math&gt;(1\leq{p}\leq\infty)&lt;/math&gt;
given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf{x}\right\Vert_{p} := \left(\sum_{i} \left\vert x_{i}\right\vert^{p} \right)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;p &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf x\right\Vert_{\infty} := \text{sup}_{i} \left\vert x_{i}\right\vert&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!---- "is finite." - ?!  ----&gt; 
The topologies on the infinite-dimensional space 
&lt;math&gt;\ell^{p}&lt;/math&gt; 
are inequivalent for different &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. 
E.g. the sequence of vectors 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{n}=\left(2^{-n}, 2^{-n}, \ldots, 2^{-n},0,0,\ldots\right)&lt;/math&gt;, 
i.e. the first &lt;math&gt;2^{n}&lt;/math&gt; components are &lt;math&gt;2^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;, 
the following ones are &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, converges to the [[zero vector]] for 
&lt;math&gt;p=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, 
but does not for 
&lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\Vert_{_\infty} = \sup (2^{-n}, 0) 
= 2^{-n} \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\Vert_{1} 
= \sum_{i=1}^{2^n} 2^{-n} = 2^n \cdot 2^{-n} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally than sequences of real numbers, functions 
&lt;math&gt;f\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
are endowed with a norm that replaces the above sum by the [[Lebesgue integral]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f}\right\Vert_{p} 
:= \left(\int_{\Omega} \left\vert{f}\left(x\right)\right\vert^{p} \, 
{d\mu\left(x\right)} 
\right)^{1/p}.&lt;/math&gt;
The space of [[integrable function]]s on a given [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] 
&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; 
(for example an interval) satisfying 
&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f}\right\Vert_{p}&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;,
and equipped with this norm are called [[Lp space|Lebesgue spaces]], 
denoted &lt;math&gt;L^{\;\!p}\left(\Omega\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The [[Triangle inequality|triangle inequality]] for 
&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f+g}\right\Vert_{p}
\leq\left\Vert{f}\right\Vert_{p}+\left\Vert{g}\right\Vert_{p}&lt;/math&gt;
is provided by the [[Minkowski inequality]]. For technical reasons, in the context of functions one has to identify functions that agree [[almost everywhere]] to get a norm, and not only a [[seminorm]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

These spaces are complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 11.2, p. 102}}&lt;/ref&gt; (If one uses the [[Riemann integral]] instead, the space is ''not'' complete, which may be seen as a justification for Lebesgue's integration theory.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;"Many functions in 
&lt;math&gt;L^{2}&lt;/math&gt; 
of Lebesgue measure, being unbounded, cannot be integrated with the classical Riemann integral. 
So spaces of Riemann integrable functions would not be complete in the 
&lt;math&gt;L^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
norm, and the orthogonal decomposition would not apply to them. 
This shows one of the advantages of Lebesgue integration.", {{Harvard citations|last = Dudley|year = 1989|nb = yes|loc=§5.3, p. 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;) 
Concretely this means that for any sequence of Lebesgue-integrable functions&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;math&gt;f_{1}, f_{2}, \ldots, f_{n},\ldots&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
with &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f}_{n}\right\Vert_{p}&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, 
satisfying the condition
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{k,\ n \to \infty}\int_{\Omega} 
\left\vert{f}_{k}(x)-{f}_{n}(x)\right\vert^{p} \, 
{d\mu\left(x\right)} 
= 0&lt;/math&gt;
there exists a function &lt;math&gt;{f}\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; belonging to the vector space &lt;math&gt;L^{\;\!p}\left(\Omega\right)&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty}\int_{\Omega} 
\left\vert{f}\left(x\right)-{f}_{k}\left(x\right)\right\vert^{p} \, 
{d\mu\left(x\right)} 
= 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Imposing boundedness conditions not only on the function, but also on its [[derivative]]s leads to [[Sobolev space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Evans|year = 1998|loc = ch. 5|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

====Hilbert spaces====
{{Main|Hilbert space}}
[[Image:Periodic identity function.gif|right|thumb|400px|The succeeding snapshots show summation of 1 to 5 terms in approximating a periodic function (blue) by finite sum of sine functions (red).]]
Complete inner product spaces are known as ''Hilbert spaces'', in honor of [[David Hilbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=ch. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hilbert space ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω), with inner product given by
:&lt;math&gt; \langle f\ , \ g \rangle = \int_\Omega f(x) \overline{g(x)} \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of ''g''(''x''),&lt;ref name=Dennery&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Dennery|year = 1996|loc = p.190|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For ''p'' ≠2, ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) is not a Hilbert space.&lt;/ref&gt; is a key case.

By definition, in a Hilbert space any Cauchy sequence converges to a limit. Conversely, finding a sequence of functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with desirable properties that approximates a given limit function, is equally crucial. Early analysis, in the guise of the [[Taylor approximation]], established an approximation of [[differentiable function]]s ''f'' by polynomials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = Th. XIII.6, p. 349|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the &lt;cite id=labelStoneWeierstrass&gt;[[Stone–Weierstrass theorem]]&lt;/cite&gt;, every continuous function on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} can be approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = Th. III.1.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approximation technique by [[trigonometric function]]s is commonly called [[Fourier expansion]], and is much applied in engineering, see [[#labelFourier|below]]. &lt;cite id=basis_in_inf_dim_context&gt;More generally, and more conceptually, the theorem yields a simple description of what "basic functions", or, in abstract Hilbert spaces, what basic vectors suffice to generate a Hilbert space ''H'', in the sense that the ''[[closure (topology)|closure]]'' of their span (i.e., finite linear combinations and limits of those) is the whole space.&lt;/cite&gt; Such a set of functions is called a ''basis'' of ''H'', its cardinality is known as the [[Hilbert space dimension]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;A basis of a Hilbert space is not the same thing as a basis in the sense of linear algebra [[#label1|above]].  For distinction, the latter is then called a [[Hamel basis]].&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does the theorem exhibit suitable basis functions as sufficient for approximation purposes, but together with the [[Gram–Schmidt process]], it enables one to construct a [[orthogonal basis|basis of orthogonal vectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Choquet|year = 1966|loc = Lemma III.16.11|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such orthogonal bases are the Hilbert space generalization of the coordinate axes in finite-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].

The solutions to various [[differential equation]]s can be interpreted in terms of Hilbert spaces. For example, a great many fields in physics and engineering lead to such equations and frequently solutions with particular physical properties are used as basis functions, often orthogonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|last=Kreyszig|year=1999|loc=Chapter 11|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example from physics, the time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] in [[quantum mechanics]] describes the change of physical properties in time by means of a [[partial differential equation]], whose solutions are called [[wavefunction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|last=Griffiths|year=1995|loc=Chapter 1|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definite values for physical properties such as energy, or momentum, correspond to [[eigenvalue]]s of a certain (linear) [[differential operator]] and the associated wavefunctions are called [[eigenstate]]s. The &lt;cite id=labelSpectralTheorem&gt;[[spectral theorem]] decomposes a linear [[compact operator]] acting on functions in terms of these eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc =ch. XVII.3|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algebras over fields===
{{Main|Algebra over a field|Lie algebra}}
[[Image:Rectangular hyperbola.svg|right|thumb|250px|A [[hyperbola]], given by the equation {{math|1=''x'' ⋅ ''y'' = 1}}. The [[coordinate ring]] of functions on this hyperbola is given by {{math|'''R'''[''x'', ''y''] / (''x'' &amp;middot; ''y'' − 1)}}, an infinite-dimensional vector space over {{math|'''R'''}}.]]
General vector spaces do not possess a multiplication between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional [[bilinear operator]] defining the multiplication of two vectors is an ''algebra over a field''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|nb = yes|loc=ch. III.1, p. 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many algebras stem from functions on some geometrical object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem mentioned [[#labelStoneWeierstrass|above]], for example, relies on [[Banach algebra]]s which are both Banach spaces and algebras.

[[Commutative algebra]] makes great use of [[polynomial ring|rings of polynomials]] in one or several variables, introduced [[#labelPolynomialRing|above]]. Their multiplication is both [[commutative]] and [[associative]]. These rings and their [[quotient ring|quotients]] form the basis of [[algebraic geometry]], because they are [[coordinate ring|rings of functions of algebraic geometric objects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Eisenbud|year = 1995|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another crucial example are ''Lie algebras'', which are neither commutative nor associative, but the failure to be so is limited by the constraints ({{math|[''x'', ''y'']}} denotes the product of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}):
*{{math|1=[''x'', ''y''] = −[''y'', ''x'']}} ([[anticommutativity]]), and
*{{math|1=[''x'', [''y'', ''z'']] + [''y'', [''z'', ''x'']] + [''z'', [''x'', ''y'']] = 0}} ([[Jacobi identity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Varadarajan|year = 1974|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples include the vector space of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices, with {{math|1=[''x'', ''y''] = ''xy'' − ''yx''}}, the [[commutator]] of two matrices, and {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, endowed with the [[cross product]].

The [[tensor algebra]] T(''V'') is a formal way of adding products to any vector space ''V'' to obtain an algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|nb = yes|loc=ch. XVI.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a vector space, it is spanned by symbols, called simple [[tensor]]s
:{{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ... ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where the [[rank of a tensor|degree]] {{math|''n''}} varies.
The multiplication is given by concatenating such symbols, imposing the [[distributive law]] under addition, and requiring that scalar multiplication commute with the tensor product ⊗, much the same way as with the tensor product of two vector spaces introduced [[#Tensor product|above]]. In general, there are no relations between {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Forcing two such elements to be equal leads to the [[symmetric algebra]], whereas forcing {{math|1='''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = − '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} yields the [[exterior algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|nb = yes|loc=ch. XVI.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a field, {{math|''F''}} is explicitly stated, a common term used is {{math|''F''}}-algebra.

==Applications==
Vector spaces have many applications as they occur frequently in common circumstances, namely wherever functions with values in some field are involved. They provide a framework to deal with analytical and geometrical problems, or are used in the Fourier transform. This list is not exhaustive: many more applications exist, for example in [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. The [[minimax theorem]] of [[game theory]] stating the existence of a unique payoff when all players play optimally can be formulated and proven using vector spaces methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Luenberger|year = 1997|nb = yes|loc=§7.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Representation theory]] fruitfully transfers the good understanding of linear algebra and vector spaces to other mathematical domains such as [[group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[representation theory]] and [[group representation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributions===
{{Main|Distribution (mathematics)|l1=Distribution}}
A ''distribution'' (or ''generalized function'') is a linear map assigning a number to each [[test function|"test" function]], typically a [[smooth function]] with [[compact support]], in a continuous way: in the [[#label2|above]] terminology the space of distributions is the (continuous) dual of the test function space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc =Ch. XI.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter space is endowed with a topology that takes into account not only ''f'' itself, but also all its higher derivatives. A standard example is the result of integrating a test function ''f'' over some domain Ω:
:&lt;math&gt;I(f) = \int_\Omega f(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
When {{math|1=Ω = {''p''},}} the set consisting of a single point, this reduces to the [[Dirac distribution]], denoted by δ, which associates to a test function ''f'' its value at the {{math|1=''p'': δ(''f'') = ''f''(''p'')}}. Distributions are a powerful instrument to solve differential equations. Since all standard analytic notions such as derivatives are linear, they extend naturally to the space of distributions. Therefore, the equation in question can be transferred to a distribution space, which is bigger than the underlying function space, so that more flexible methods are available for solving the equation. For example, [[Green's function]]s and [[fundamental solution]]s are usually distributions rather than proper functions, and can then be used to find solutions of the equation with prescribed boundary conditions. The found solution can then in some cases be proven to be actually a true function, and a solution to the original equation (e.g., using the [[Lax–Milgram theorem]], a consequence of the [[Riesz representation theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Evans|year = 1998|loc =Th. 6.2.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resolving a [[periodic function]] into a sum of [[trigonometric functions]] forms a &lt;cite id=labelFourier&gt;''[[Fourier series]]''&lt;/cite&gt;, a technique much used in physics and engineering.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Although the Fourier series is periodic, the technique can be applied to any ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function on an interval by considering the function to be continued periodically outside the interval. See {{Harvard citations|last = Kreyszig|year = 1988|loc=p. 601|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Folland|year = 1992|loc = p. 349 ''ff''|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying vector space is usually the [[Hilbert space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0, 2π), for which the functions sin ''mx'' and cos ''mx'' (''m'' an integer) form an orthogonal basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=p. 150|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fourier expansion]] of an ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function ''f'' is
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\left[a_m\cos\left(mx\right)+b_m\sin\left(mx\right)\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are called [[Fourier coefficient]]s of ''f'', and are calculated by the formulas&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=§4.5|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_m = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} f(t) \cos (mt) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_m = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} f(t) \sin (mt) \, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

In physical terms the function is represented as a [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of [[sine waves]] and the coefficients give information about the function's [[frequency spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=p. 57|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general [[duality (mathematics)|mathematical duality]] called [[Pontryagin duality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1=Loomis  | year=1953|loc=Ch. VII|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied to the [[group (mathematics)|group]] '''R''', it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are [[reciprocal lattice]]s, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] encoding positions of [[atom]]s in [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1=Ashcroft | last2=Mermin | year=1976|loc=Ch. 5|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier series are used to solve [[boundary value problem]]s in [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kreyszig|year = 1988|loc=p. 667|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1822, [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]] first used this technique to solve the [[heat equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Fourier|year = 1822|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discrete version of the Fourier series can be used in [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=p. 67|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of coefficients is known as the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT is one of the key tools of [[digital signal processing]], a field whose applications include [[radar]], [[speech encoding]], [[image compression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Ifeachor|last2 = Jervis|year=2002|loc=pp. 3–4, 11|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[JPEG]] image format is an application of the closely related [[discrete cosine transform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wallace|year = Feb 1992|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fast Fourier transform]] is an algorithm for rapidly computing the discrete Fourier transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Ifeachor|last2 = Jervis|year=2002|loc=p. 132|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used not only for calculating the Fourier coefficients but, using the [[convolution theorem]], also for computing the [[convolution]] of two finite sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=§10.2|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They in turn are applied in [[digital filter]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Ifeachor|last2 = Jervis|year=2002|loc=pp. 307–310|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a rapid [[multiplication algorithm]] for polynomials and large integers ([[Schönhage–Strassen algorithm]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=§10.3|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1=Schönhage|last2=Strassen|year=1971|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential geometry===
{{Main|Tangent space}}
[[Image:Image Tangent-plane.svg|right|thumb|200px|The tangent space to the [[2-sphere]] at some point is the infinite plane touching the sphere in this point.]]
The [[tangent plane]] to a surface at a point is naturally a vector space whose origin is identified with the point of contact.  The tangent plane is the best [[linear approximation]], or [[linearization]], of a surface at a point.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;That is to say {{harv|BSE-3|2001}}, the plane passing through the point of contact ''P'' such that the distance from a point ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the surface to the plane is [[little o|infinitesimally small]] compared to the distance from ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''P'' in the limit as ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; approaches ''P'' along the surface.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, there is typically no natural way to prescribe a basis of the tangent plane, and so it is conceived of as an abstract vector space rather than a real coordinate space. The ''tangent space'' is the generalization to higher-dimensional [[differentiable manifold]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Spivak|year = 1999|loc = ch. 3|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Riemannian manifold]]s are manifolds whose tangent spaces are endowed with a [[Riemannian metric|suitable inner product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Jost|year = 2005|nb = yes}}. See also [[Lorentzian manifold]].&lt;/ref&gt; Derived therefrom, the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] encodes all [[curvature (mathematics)|curvatures]] of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in [[general relativity]], for example, where the [[Einstein curvature tensor]] describes the matter and energy content of [[space-time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Misner|last2=Thorne|last3=Wheeler|year = 1973|loc = ch. 1.8.7, p. 222 and ch. 2.13.5, p. 325|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Jost|year = 2005|loc = ch. 3.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tangent space of a Lie group can be given naturally the structure of a Lie algebra and can be used to classify [[compact Lie group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Varadarajan|year = 1974|loc = ch. 4.3, Theorem 4.3.27|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

===Vector bundles===
{{Main|Vector bundle|Tangent bundle}}
[[Image:Mobius strip illus.svg|thumb|249px|right|A Möbius strip. Locally, it [[homeomorphism|looks like]] {{math|''U'' × '''R'''}}.]]
A ''vector bundle'' is a family of vector spaces parametrized continuously by a [[topological space]] ''X''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; More precisely, a vector bundle over ''X'' is a topological space ''E'' equipped with a continuous map 
:π&amp;thinsp;: ''E'' → ''X''
such that for every ''x'' in ''X'', the [[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]] π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is a vector space. The case dim {{math|1=''V'' = 1}} is called a [[line bundle]]. For any vector space ''V'', the projection {{math|''X'' × ''V'' → ''X''}} makes the product {{math|''X'' × ''V''}} into a [[trivial bundle|"trivial" vector bundle]]. Vector bundles over ''X'' are required to be [[locally]] a product of ''X'' and some (fixed) vector space ''V'': for every ''x'' in ''X'', there is a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] ''U'' of ''x'' such that the restriction of π to π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') is isomorphic&lt;ref group=nb&gt;That is, there is a [[homeomorphism]] from π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') to {{math|''V'' × ''U''}} which restricts to linear isomorphisms between fibers.&lt;/ref&gt; to the trivial bundle {{math|''U'' × ''V'' → ''U''}}. Despite their locally trivial character, vector bundles may (depending on the shape of the underlying space ''X'') be "twisted" in the large (i.e., the bundle need not be (globally isomorphic to) the trivial bundle {{math|''X'' × ''V''}}). For example, the [[Möbius strip]] can be seen as a line bundle over the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (by [[homeomorphism#Examples|identifying open intervals with the real line]]). It is, however, different from the [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × '''R'''}}, because the latter is [[orientable manifold|orientable]] whereas the former is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kreyszig|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=§34, p. 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properties of certain vector bundles provide information about the underlying topological space. For example, the [[tangent bundle]] consists of the collection of [[tangent space]]s parametrized by the points of a differentiable manifold. The tangent bundle of the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is globally isomorphic to {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × '''R'''}}, since there is a global nonzero [[vector field]] on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;A line bundle, such as the tangent bundle of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is trivial if and only if there is a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] that vanishes nowhere, see {{Harvard citations|last = Husemoller|year = 1994|nb = yes|loc=Corollary 8.3}}. The sections of the tangent bundle are just [[vector field]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, by the [[hairy ball theorem]], there is no (tangent) vector field on the [[2-sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which is everywhere nonzero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citations|last1=Eisenberg|last2=Guy|year=1979|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[K-theory]] studies the isomorphism classes of all vector bundles over some topological space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Atiyah|year = 1989|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to deepening topological and geometrical insight, it has purely algebraic consequences, such as the classification of finite-dimensional real [[division algebra]]s: '''R''', '''C''', the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' and the [[octonion]]s '''O'''.

The [[cotangent bundle]] of a differentiable manifold consists, at every point of the manifold, of the dual of the tangent space, the [[cotangent space]]. [[Section (fiber bundle)|Sections]] of that bundle are known as [[differential form|differential one-form]]s.

===Modules===
{{Main|Module (mathematics)|l1=Module}}
''Modules'' are to [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] what vector spaces are to fields: the same axioms, applied to a ring ''R'' instead of a field ''F'', yield modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Artin|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=ch. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of modules, compared to that of vector spaces, is complicated by the presence of ring elements that do not have [[multiplicative inverse]]s. For example, modules need not have bases, as the '''Z'''-module (i.e., [[abelian group]]) [[Modular arithmetic|'''Z'''/2'''Z''']] shows; those modules that do (including all vector spaces) are known as [[free module]]s. Nevertheless, a vector space can be compactly defined as a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] which is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] with the elements being called vectors.  Some authors use the term ''vector space'' to mean modules over a [[division ring]].&lt;ref&gt;Grillet, Pierre Antoine. Abstract algebra. Vol. 242. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The algebro-geometric interpretation of commutative rings via their [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] allows the development of concepts such as [[locally free module]]s, the algebraic counterpart to vector bundles.

===Affine and projective spaces===
{{Main|Affine space|Projective space}}
[[Image:Affine subspace.svg|thumb|right|200px|An [[affine space|affine plane]] (light blue) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It is a two-dimensional subspace shifted by a vector '''x''' (red).]] 
Roughly, ''affine spaces'' are vector spaces whose origins are not specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Meyer|year = 2000|nb = yes|loc=Example 5.13.5, p. 436}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, an affine space is a set with a [[transitive group action|free transitive]] vector space [[group action|action]]. In particular, a vector space is an affine space over itself, by the map
:{{math|''V'' × ''V'' → ''V'', ('''v''', '''a''') ↦ '''a''' + '''v'''}}.
If ''W'' is a vector space, then an affine subspace is a subset of ''W'' obtained by translating a linear subspace ''V'' by a fixed vector {{math|'''x''' ∈ ''W''}}; this space is denoted by {{math|'''x''' + ''V''}} (it is a [[coset]] of ''V'' in ''W'') and consists of all vectors of the form {{math|'''x''' + '''v'''}} for {{math|'''v''' ∈ ''V''.}} An important example is the space of solutions of a system of inhomogeneous linear equations
:''A'''''x''' = '''b'''
generalizing the homogeneous case {{math|1='''b''' = 0}} [[#equation3|above]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Meyer|year = 2000|nb = yes|loc=Exercise 5.13.15–17, p. 442}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space of solutions is the affine subspace {{math|'''x''' + ''V''}} where '''x''' is a particular solution of the equation, and ''V'' is the space of solutions of the homogeneous equation (the [[nullspace]] of ''A'').

The set of one-dimensional subspaces of a fixed finite-dimensional vector space ''V'' is known as ''projective space''; it may be used to formalize the idea of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines intersecting at infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Coxeter|year = 1987|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grassmannian manifold|Grassmannians]] and [[flag manifold]]s generalize this by parametrizing linear subspaces of fixed dimension ''k'' and [[flag (linear algebra)|flags]] of subspaces, respectively.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:German words and phrases]]}}
'''''Zugzwang''''' (German for "compulsion to move", {{IPA-de|ˈtsuːktsvaŋ|pron}}) is a situation found in [[chess]] and other games wherein one [[player (game)|player]] is put at a disadvantage because they must make a move when they would prefer to pass and not move. The fact that the player is compelled to move means that their position will become significantly weaker. A player is said to be "in zugzwang" when any possible move will worsen their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soltis|2003a|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used in [[combinatorial game theory]], where it means that it directly changes the outcome of the game from a win to a loss, but the term is used less precisely in games such as chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berlekamp|Conway|Guy|1982|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elkies|1996|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putting the opponent in zugzwang is a common way to help the superior side win a game, and in some cases, it is necessary in order to make the win possible.&lt;ref name=mull08p173&gt;{{harvnb|Müller|Pajeken|2008|pp=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''zugzwang'' was used in [[German (language)|German]] chess literature in 1858 or earlier,&lt;ref name=winter97 /&gt; and the first known use of the term in English was by [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]] [[Emanuel Lasker]] in 1905.&lt;ref name=winter08 /&gt; The concept of zugzwang was known to players many [[centuries]] before the term was coined, appearing in an [[endgame study]] published in 1604 by [[Alessandro Salvio]], one of the first writers on the game, and in [[shatranj]] studies dating back to the early 9th century, over 1000 years before the first known use of the term.

Positions with zugzwang occur fairly often in chess [[Chess endgame|endgames]], especially in [[King and pawn versus king endgame|king and pawn endgames]]. According to [[John Nunn]], positions of reciprocal zugzwang are surprisingly important in the analysis of endgames.&lt;ref name=nunn95p6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nunn99p7&gt;{{harvnb|Nunn|1999|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}

==Etymology==
The word comes from German ''Zug'' 'move' + ''Zwang'' 'compulsion', so that ''Zugzwang'' means 'being forced to make a move'. Originally the term was used interchangeably with the term ''zugpflicht'' 'obligation to make a move' as a general game rule. Games like chess and [[checkers]] have "zugzwang" (or "zugpflicht"): a player ''must'' always make a move on his turn even if this is to their disadvantage. [[wargaming|Tabletop war games]] or [[role playing games]] do not: a player can simply decide to "wait" or "do nothing" on their turn. Over time, the term became especially associated with chess.

According to chess [[historian]] [[Edward Winter (chess historian)|Edward Winter]], the term had been in use in German chess circles in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=winter97&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Pages 353–358 of the September 1858 Deutsche Schachzeitung had an unsigned article "Zugzwang, Zugwahl und Privilegien". F. Amelung employed the terms Zugzwang, Tempozwang and Tempozugzwang on pages 257–259 of the September 1896 issue of the same magazine. When a perceived example of zugzwang occurred in the third game of the 1896–97 world championship match between Steinitz and Lasker, after 34...Rg8, the Deutsche Schachzeitung (December 1896, page 368) reported that "White has died of zugzwang".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The earliest known use of the term ''zugzwang'' in English was on page 166 of the February 1905 issue of ''[[Emanuel Lasker|Lasker's]] Chess Magazine''.&lt;ref name=winter08&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term did not become common in English-language chess sources until the 1930s, after the publication of the English translation of Nimzowitsch's ''[[My System]]'' in 1929.&lt;ref name=winter97 /&gt;

==History==
The concept of zugzwang, if not the term, must have been known to players for many centuries. Zugzwang is required to win the elementary (and common) [[Checkmate#King and rook|king and rook versus king]] [[endgame (chess)|endgame]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soltis|2003a|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the king and rook (or differently-named pieces with the same powers) have been chess pieces since the earliest versions of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davidson|1981|pp=21–22,41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of zugzwang is also seen in the 1585 [[endgame study]] by [[Giulio Cesare Polerio]], published in 1604 by [[Alessandro Salvio]], one of the earliest writers on the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angos|2005|pp=108–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only way for White to win is 1.Ra1 Kxa1 2.Kc2, placing Black in zugzwang. The only legal move is 2...g5, whereupon White [[promotion (chess)|promotes]] a pawn first and then [[checkmate]]s with 3.hxg5 h4 4.g6 h3 5.g7 h2 6.g8=Q h1=Q 7.Qg7#&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sukhin|2007|pp=21, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Bertin]] refers to zugzwang in ''The Noble Game of Chess'' (1735), wherein he documents 19 rules about chess play. His 18th rule is: "To play well the latter end of a game, you must calculate who has the move, on which the game always depends."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François-André Danican Philidor]] wrote in 1777 of the position illustrated that after White plays 36.Kc3, Black "is obliged to move his rook from his king, which gives you an opportunity of taking his rook by a double check [sic], or making him [[checkmate|mate]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Philidor|2005|pp=272–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasker explicitly cited a mirror image of this position (White: king on f3, queen on h4; Black: king on g1, rook on g2) as an example of zugzwang in ''Lasker's Manual of Chess''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lasker|1960|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British master [[George Walker (chess player)|George Walker]] analyzed a similar position in the same endgame, giving a maneuver that resulted in the superior side reaching the initial position, but now with the inferior side on move and in zugzwang. Walker wrote of the superior side's decisive move: "throwing the move upon Black, in the initial position, and thereby winning".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1846|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Morphy]] is credited with composing the position illustrated "while still a young boy". After 1.Ra6, Black is in zugzwang and must allow mate on the next move with 1...bxa6 2.b7# or 1...B (moves) 2.Rxa7#.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shibut|2004|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zugzwang in chess==
There are three types of chess positions:
# each side would benefit if it were their turn to move
# only one player would be at a disadvantage if it were their turn to move
# both players would be at a disadvantage if it were their turn to move.
The great majority of positions are of the first type.  In chess literature, most writers call positions of the second type ''zugzwang'', and the third type ''reciprocal zugzwang'' or ''mutual zugzwang''.  Some writers call the second type a ''squeeze'' and the third type ''zugzwang''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooper|1970|pp=196–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally in chess, having [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]] is desirable because the player who is to move has the advantage of being able to choose a move that improves their situation. Zugzwang typically occurs when "the player to move cannot do anything without making an important concession".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Perlo|2006|p=479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Müller|Lamprecht|2001|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zugzwang most often occurs in the endgame when the number of pieces, and so the number of possible moves, is reduced, and the exact move chosen is often critical. The first diagram shows the simplest possible example of zugzwang. If it is White's move, they must either [[stalemate]] Black with 1.Kc6 or abandon the [[pawn (chess)|pawn]], allowing 1...Kxc7 with a draw. If it is Black's move, the only legal move is 1...Kb7, which allows White to win with 2.Kd7 followed by [[Promotion (chess)|queening]] the pawn on the next move.

The second diagram is another simple example. Black, on move, must allow White to play Kc5 or Ke5, when White wins one or more [[pawn (chess)|pawns]] and can advance his own pawn toward [[promotion (chess)|promotion]]. White, on move, must retreat his [[king (chess)|king]], when Black is out of danger.&lt;ref name=flear04p11&gt;{{harvnb|Flear|2004|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squares d4 and d6 are ''[[corresponding squares]]''. Whenever the white king is on d4 with White to move, the black king must be on d6 to prevent the advance of the white king.

In many cases, the player having the move can put the other player in zugzwang by using ''[[triangulation (chess)|triangulation]]''. This often occurs in king and pawn endgames. Pieces other than the king can also triangulate to achieve zugzwang, such as in the [[Philidor position]]. Zugzwang is a mainstay of [[chess composition]]s and occurs frequently in [[endgame study|endgame studies]].

: '''86. h6 Ng5'''

In the position on the right, White has just gotten his king to a6, where it attacks the black pawn on b6, tying down the black king to defend it.  White now needs to get his [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] to f7 or e8 to attack the pawn on g6.  Play continued:
: '''57... Nc8'''
: '''58. Bd5 Ne7'''
: '''59. Bc4! Nc6'''

Now the bishop is able to make a [[tempo (chess)|tempo]] move.  It is able to move while still attacking the pawn on g6, and preventing the black king from moving to c6.
: '''61. Be8'''
and Black is in zugzwang.  Knights are unable to lose a tempo,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nunn|1995|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; so moving the knight would allow the bishop to capture the {{chessgloss|kingside}} pawns.  The black king must give way.

and White has a won position.  Either one of White's {{chessgloss|queenside}} pawns will promote or the white king will attack and win the black kingside pawns and a kingside pawn will promote.  Black [[resign (chess)|resigned]] seven moves later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silman|2007|pp=516–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Averbakh|1984|pp=113–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flear|2007|pp=286–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andy Soltis]] says that this is "perhaps Fischer's most famous endgame".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soltis|2003b|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This position from a 1988 game between [[Vitaly Tseshkovsky]] and [[Glenn Flear]] at Wijk aan Zee shows an instance of "zugzwang" where the obligation to move makes the defense more difficult, but it does not mean the loss of the game.  A [[draw by agreement]] was reached eleven moves later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flear|2007|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1386439 Tseshkovsky vs. Flear, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

|Reciprocal zugzwang, White to move draws, Black to move loses.
}}
A special case of zugzwang is ''reciprocal zugzwang'' or ''mutual zugzwang'', which is a position such that whoever is to move is in zugzwang. Studying positions of reciprocal zugzwang is in the analysis of endgames.&lt;ref name=nunn95p6&gt;{{harvnb|Nunn|1995|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nunn99p7 /&gt; A position of mutual zugzwang is closely related to a game with a Conway value of zero in [[Combinatorial game theory|game theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stiller|1996|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a position with reciprocal zugzwang, only the player to move is actually in zugzwang.  However, the player who is not in zugzwang must play carefully because one inaccurate move can cause him to be put in zugzwang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Müller|Pajeken|2008|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is in contrast to regular zugzwang, because the superior side usually has a [[waiting move]] to put the opponent in zugzwang.&lt;ref name=nunn99p7 /&gt;

The diagram on the right shows a position of reciprocal zugzwang.  If Black is to move, 1... Kd7 is forced, which loses because White will move 2. Kb7, promote the pawn, and win.  If White is to move the result is a draw as White must either stalemate Black with 1. Kc6 or allow Black to {{chessgloss|capture}} the pawn. Since each side would be in zugzwang if it were his move, it is a reciprocal zugzwang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooper|1970|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Averbakh|1993|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
An extreme type of reciprocal zugzwang, called ''trébuchet'', is shown in the diagram. It is also called a ''full-point mutual zugzwang'' because it will result in a loss for the player in zugzwang, resulting a full point for his opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nunn|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whoever is to move in this position must abandon his own [[pawn (chess)|pawn]], thus allowing his opponent to capture it and proceed to [[promotion (chess)|promote]] the remaining pawn, resulting in an easily winnable position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flear|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corresponding squares]] are squares of mutual zugzwang.  When there is only one pair of corresponding squares, they are called ''mined squares''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dvoretsky|2003|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A player will fall into zugzwang if they move their king onto the square and his opponent is able to move onto the corresponding square.  In the diagram on the right, if either king moves onto the square marked with the dot of the same color, it falls into zugzwang if the other king moves into the mined square near them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dvoretsky|2006|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zugzwang usually works in favor of the stronger side, but sometimes it aids the defense.  In this position based on a game between [[Zoltán Varga (chess player)|Zoltán Varga]] and [[Peter Acs]], it saves the game for the defense:
: '''1... Kc4!!'''
Reciprocal zugzwang.
: '''2. Nc3 Kb4'''
Reciprocal zugzwang again.
: '''3. Kd3 Bg7'''
Reciprocal zugzwang again.
: '''4. Kc2 Bh6 5. Kd3 Bg7 6. Nd5+ Kxa4 7. Ke4 Kb5 8. Kf5 Kc5 9. Kg6 Bd4 10. Nf4 Kd6 11. h6 Ke7 12. h7 Bb2'''
This position is a draw and the players [[draw by agreement|agreed to a draw]] a few moves later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Müller|Pajeken|2008|pp=179–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zugzwang in the middlegame and complex endgames==
Alex Angos notes that, "As the number of pieces on the board increases, the probability for ''zugzwang'' to occur decreases."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angos|2005|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, zugzwang is very rarely seen in the [[middlegame (chess)|middlegame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angos|2005|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game [[Friedrich Sämisch|Fritz Sämisch]] versus [[Aron Nimzowitsch]], [[Copenhagen]] 1923,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1102400 Sämisch vs. Nimzowitsch]&lt;/ref&gt; is often called the "Immortal Zugzwang Game". According to Nimzowitsch, writing in the ''[[Wiener Schachzeitung]]'' in 1925, this term originated in "Danish chess circles".&lt;ref name=winter97 /&gt; Some consider the final position to be an extremely rare instance of zugzwang occurring in the middlegame.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reinfeld|1958|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ended with White [[resign (chess)|resigning]] in the position in the diagram.

White has a few pawn moves which do not lose material, but eventually he will have to move one of his pieces. If he plays 1.Rc1 or Rd1, then 1...Re2 traps White's queen; 1.Kh2 fails to 1...R5f3, also trapping the queen, since White cannot play 2.Bxf3 because the bishop is [[pin (chess)|pinned]] to the king; 1.g4 runs into 1...R5f3 2.Bxf3? Rh2 mate. Angos analyzes 1.a3 a5 2.axb4 axb4 3.h4 Kh8 (waiting) 4.b3 Kg8 and White has run out of waiting moves and must lose material. Best in this line is 5.Nc3!? bxc3 6.bxc3, which just leaves Black with a serious positional advantage and an extra pawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angos|2005|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other moves lose material in more obvious ways.

However, since Black would win even without the zugzwang,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nunn|1981|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is debatable whether the position is true zugzwang. Even if White could pass his move he would still lose, albeit more slowly, after 1...R5f3 2.Bxf3 Rxf3, trapping the queen and thus winning queen and bishop for two rooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horowitz|1971|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfgang Heidenfeld]] thus considers it a misnomer to call this a true zugzwang position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golombek|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Immortal Zugzwang Game#Objections to the sobriquet|Immortal Zugzwang Game: Objections to the sobriquet]].

Soltis writes that his "candidate for the ideal zugzwang game" is the following game {{harvnb|Soltis|1978|p=55}}, Podgaets–[[Mark Dvoretsky|Dvoretsky]], [[USSR]] 1974: '''1. d4 c5 2. d5 e5 3. e4 d6 4.

}}
[[Jonathan Rowson]] coined the term ''Zugzwang Lite'' to describe a situation, sometimes arising in symmetrical [[chess opening|opening]] variations, where White's "extra move" is a burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rowson|2005|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites as an example of this phenomenon in [[Julian Hodgson|Hodgson]] versus [[Keith Arkell|Arkell]] at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] 2001. The position at left arose after '''1. c4 c5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. a3 a6 6. Rb1 Rb8 7. b4 cxb4 8. axb4 b5 9. cxb5 axb5''' (see diagram). Here Rowson remarks, &lt;blockquote&gt;Both sides want to push their d-pawn and play Bf4/...Bf5, but White has to go first so Black gets to play ...d5 before White can play d4. This doesn't matter much, but it already points to the challenge that White faces here; his most natural continuations allow Black to play the moves he wants to. I would therefore say that White is in 'Zugzwang Lite' and that he remains in this state for several moves.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The game continued '''10. Nf3 d5 11. d4 Nf6 12. Bf4 Rb6 13. 0-0 Bf5 14. Rb3 0-0 15. Ne5 Ne4 16. h3 h5!? 17. Kh2'''. The position is still almost symmetrical, and White can find nothing useful to do with his extra move. Rowson whimsically suggests 17.h4!?, forcing Black to be the one to break the symmetry. '''17... Re8!''' Rowson notes that this is a useful waiting move, covering e7, which needs protection in some lines, and possibly supporting an eventual ...e5 (as Black in fact played on his 22nd move). White cannot copy it, since after 18.Re1? Nxf2 Black would win a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]]. After '''18. Be3?! Nxe5! 19. dxe5 Rc6!''' Black seized the initiative and went on to win in 14 more moves.
