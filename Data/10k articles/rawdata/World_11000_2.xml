'''Afri''' (singular ''Afer'') was a [[Latin]] name for the inhabitants of [[Africa]], referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean ([[Ancient Libya]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Georges|first1=Karl Ernst|editor1-last=Georges|editor1-first=Heinrich|encyclopedia=Ausführliches lateinisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch|date=1913–1918|location=Hannover|edition=8th|url=http://latin_german.deacademic.com/1644|accessdate=20 September 2015|language=German|title=Afri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Lewis|first1=Charlton T.|last2=Short|first2=Charles|encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary|date=1879|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DAfer|accessdate=20 September 2015|title=Afer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin-speakers at first used ''afer'' as an adjective, meaning "of Africa". As a substantive, it denoted a native of ''Africa'', i.&amp;nbsp;e., an African.

The ultimate etymology of the term for the country remains uncertain. It may derive from a Punic term for an indigenous population of the area surrounding [[Carthage]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} (See [[Terence#Biography|Terence]] for discussion.) The name is usually connected with [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''ʿafar'', "dust",&lt;ref&gt;Venter &amp; Neuland, ''NEPAD and the African Renaissance'' (2005), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; (also found in other [[Semitic languages]]), but a 1981 hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;[http://michel-desfayes.org/namesofcountries.html Names of countries], Decret and Fantar, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; has asserted that it stems from the [[Berber languages|Berber]] ''ifri'' (plural ''ifran'') "cave", in reference to cave dwellers.&lt;ref name="Michell"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/714549 Geo. Babington Michell, "The Berbers"], ''Journal of the Royal African Society'', Vol. 2, No. 6 (January 1903), pp. 161-194.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Tataouine]].) The same word&lt;ref name=Michell /&gt; may be found in the name of the [[Banu Ifran]] from [[Algeria]] and [[Tripolitania]], a [[Berber people|Berber]] tribe originally from [[Yafran]] (also known as ''Ifrane'') in northwestern Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=Itineraria+Phoenicia+Ifren&amp;sig=opSH-an97IhmB6GtJjMvn7bt4tc#PPA200,M1 Edward Lipinski, ''Itineraria Phoenicia''], Peeters Publishers, 2004, p. 200. {{ISBN|90-429-1344-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The classical historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (born 37 CE) asserted that descendants of [[Abraham]]'s grandson [[Epher]] invaded the region and gave it their own name.

During the period of the [[Roman Empire]], ''Afer'' came to be a [[cognomen]] for people from [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]].

This ethnonym provided the source of the [[Africa (etymology)|term ''Africa'']].  The Romans referred to the region as ''Africa terra'' (land of the Afri), based on the stem ''Afr''- with the adjective suffix -''ic''- (giving ''Africus'', ''Africa'', ''Africum'' in the nominative singular of the three [[Latin]] genders).  Following the defeat of Carthage in the [[Third Punic War]], Rome set up the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]].

The Germanic tribe of the [[Vandals]] conquered the Roman [[Diocese of Africa]] in the 5th century; the empire re-conquered it as the [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa]] in AD 534. The Latin name ''Africa'' came into Arabic after the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Islamic conquest]] as  ''[[Ifriqiya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://michel-desfayes.org/namesofcountries.html Names of countries], Decret &amp; Fantar, 1981
&lt;/ref&gt;

The name survives today as Ifira and Ifri-n-Dellal in Greater [[Kabylie]] ([[Algeria]]). A [[Berber mythology|Berber]] tribe was called{{by whom|date=August 2014}} [[Banu Ifran]] in the Middle Ages, and Ifurace was the name of a Tripolitan people in the 6th century.  
[[Caveman|Troglodytism]], once frequent in northern Africa, still occurs today in southern Tunisia. [[Herodotus]] wrote that the [[Garamantes]], a North African people, used to live in caves. The Greeks also called an African people who lived in caves ''[[Troglodytae]]''.

{{Distinguish|Arctic}}
'''Arctica''' or '''Arctida'''&lt;ref name="VerniDobre-2015-p206"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vernikovsky|Dobretsov|2015|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an ancient [[continent]] which formed approximately 2.565&amp;nbsp;[[billion years ago]] in the [[Neoarchean]] era.  It was made of Archaean [[craton]]s, including the [[Aldan Craton|Aldan]] and [[Anabar Craton|Anabar]]/[[Angara craton|Angara]] cratons in Siberia and the [[Slave Craton|Slave]], [[Wyoming Craton|Wyoming]], [[Superior Craton|Superior]], and [[North Atlantic Craton|North Atlantic]] cratons in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1996|loc=Fig. 4, p. 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arctica was named by {{Harvnb|Rogers|1996}} because the [[Arctic Ocean]] formed by the separation of the [[North American Craton|North American]] and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberian]] cratons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1996|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russian geologists writing in English call the continent "Arctida" since it was given that name in 1987,&lt;ref name="VerniDobre-2015-p206" /&gt; alternatively the '''Hyperborean craton''',&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Harvnb|Khain|Polyakova|Filatova|2009|loc=Tectonic units and their history, p. 335}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the [[hyperborea]]ns in [[Greek mythology]].

[[Nikolay Shatsky]] ({{Harvnb|Shatsky|1935}}) was the first to assume that the crust in the Arctic region was of continental origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Khain|Filatova|2009|p=1076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shatsky, however, was a "fixist" and, erroneously, explained the presence of Precambrian and Paleozoic metamorphic rocks on the New Siberian, Wrangel, and De long Islands with [[subduction]].  "Mobilists", on the other hand, also erroneously, proposed that North America had rifted from Eurasia and that the Arctic basins had opened behind a retreating Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zonenshain|Natapov|1987|loc=Introduction, p. 829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precambrian continent==
In his reconstruction of the [[supercontinent cycle]], Rogers proposed that the continent [[Ur (continent)|Ur]] formed at about 3&amp;nbsp;Ga and formed East [[Gondwana]] in the Middle Proterozoic by accretion to [[East Antarctica]]; Arctica formed around 2.5–2&amp;nbsp;Ga by the amalgamation of the [[Canadian Shield|Canadian]] and Siberian shields plus Greenland; and [[Atlantica]] formed around 2&amp;nbsp;Ga by the amalgamation of the [[West African Craton]] and eastern South America.  Arctica then grew around 1.5&amp;nbsp;Ga by accretion of East Antarctica and [[Baltica]] to form the supercontinent [[Nena (supercontinent)|Nena]].  Around 1&amp;nbsp;Ga Nena, Ur, and Atlantica collided to form the supercontinent [[Rodinia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1996|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvnb|Rogers|Santosh|2003}} argued that most cratons that were around at 2.5&amp;nbsp;Ga most likely formed in a single region simply because they were located in a single region in Pangaea, which is the reason Rogers argued for the existence of Arctica.
The core of Arctica was the Canadian Shield, which {{Harvnb|Williams|Hoffman|Lewry|Monger|1991}} named [[Kenorland]]. They argued that this continent formed around 2.5&amp;nbsp;Ga then rifted before reassembling along the 1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga [[Trans-Hudson orogeny|Trans-Hudson]] and [[Taltson-Thelon orogeny|Taltson-Thelon]] orogenies.  These two orogenies are derived from continental crust (not oceanic crust) and were probably intracontinental, leaving Kenorland intact from 2.5&amp;nbsp;Ga to present.  Correlations between orogenies in Canada and Siberia remain more controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|Santosh|2003|loc=Arctica and Kenorland (~2500&amp;nbsp;Ma), pp.&amp;nbsp;360–361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurentia]] and Baltica were connected during the Late Palaeoproterzoic (1.7–1.74&amp;nbsp;Ga) and Siberia later joined them.  Paleomagnetic reconstructions indicate that they formed a single supercontinent during the Mesoproterozoic (1.5–1.45&amp;nbsp;Ga) but paleomagnetic data and geological evidences also suggest a considerable spatial gap between Siberia and Laurentia and Arctica is thought to be the missing link.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tait|Pisarevsky|2009|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phanerozoic microcontinent==
The current geological structure of the Arctic Region is the result of tectonic processes during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (250&amp;nbsp;Ma to present) when the [[Amerasian Basin|Amerasian]] and [[Eurasian Basin|Eurasian]] basins formed, but the presence of Precambrian metamorphic complexes discovered in the 1980s indicated a continent once existed between [[Laurentia]], [[Baltica]], and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]].&lt;ref name="Vernikovsky-2014-intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vernikovsky|Metelkin|Vernikovskaya|Matushkin|2014|loc=Introduction, pp. 265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the reconstruction of {{Harvnb|Metelkin|Vernikovsky|Matushkin|2015}}, Arctica originally formed as a continent during the [[Tonian]] 950&amp;nbsp;Ma and became part of the supercontinent [[Rodinia]].  It reformed during the Permian-Triassic 255&amp;nbsp;Ma and became part of [[Pangaea]].  During this period the configuration of Arctica changed and the continent moved from near the Equator to near the North Pole while keeping its position between three major cratons: Laurentia, Baltica, and Siberia.&lt;ref name="VerniDobre-2015-p206" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vernikovsky|Dobretsov|2015|loc=Fig. 2, p. 208}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An extended magmatic event, the [[High Arctic Large Igneous Province]], broke Arctica in part 130–90&amp;nbsp;Ma, opened the [[Arctic Ocean]], and left radiating [[dyke swarm]]s across the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ernst|Bleeker|2010|loc=90–130 Ma: northern Canada, initiation of the Arctic Ocean, p. 701, fig. 6b, p.705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fragments of this continent include the [[Kara Sea|Kara Shelf]], [[New Siberian Islands]], northern [[Alaska]], [[Chukotka Peninsula]], Inuit Fold Belt in northern Greenland, and two Arctic underwater ridges, the [[Lomonosov Ridge|Lomonosov]] and [[Alpha Ridge|Alpha]]-[[Mendeleev Ridge]]s.  More recent reconstructions also include Barentsia (including [[Svalbard]] and Timan-Pechora Plates).&lt;ref name="Vernikovsky-2014-intro" /&gt;
Remains of the last continent are now located on the [[Kara Sea]] Shelf, [[New Siberian Islands]] and adjacent shelf, [[Alaska]] north of [[Brooks Range|Brooks Ridge]], [[Chukchi Peninsula]] in eastern-most Siberia, and fragments in northern [[Greenland]] and [[Northern Canada]] and in the submerged [[Lomonosov Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Metelkin|Vernikovsky|Matushkin|2015|loc=Introduction, p. 114; Fig. 1, p. 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2329">'''Banque pour le Commerce et l'Industrie – Mer Rouge''' ('''BCIMR''') is a [[bank]] in [[Djibouti]]. It has a [[market share]] of around 45%, and is the largest bank in the [[Horn of Africa]]. BCIMR is a [[subsidiary]] of the French bank [[BRED Banque populaire]], which owns a 51% share in the company. The Government of Djibouti and a Yemeni bank own the remaining 33% and 16% shares, respectively. BCIMR has a branch in [[Hargeisa]], situated in the northwestern [[Somaliland]] region of [[Somalia]].

==History==
In 1943, [[BNCI]], an ancestor of [[BNP Paribas]], took over [[Crédit Foncier de Madagascar et de la Réunion]], which it renamed BNCI Océan Indien in 1954. [[BNCI Océan Indien]] opened a [[branch (banking)|branch]] in Djibouti the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Alwan &amp; Mibrathi (2000), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, when Djibouti achieved independence from [[France]], BNP converted the branch into a subsidiary.

In July 2007, BNP Paribas sold BCIMR to the French banking group [[BRED Banque populaire|Banques Populaires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesafriques.com/djibouti/la-banque-pour-le-commerce-et-l-industrie-mer-rouge-bci-mr-a-rompu-son-partenariat-avec-la-bn.html?Itemid=320 |title=La Banque pour le commerce et l'industrie Mer-Rouge (BCI-MR) a rompu son partenariat avec la BNP Par |publisher=Les Afriques |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, BCIMR opened a branch in [[Hargeisa]], becoming the first bank there since the dissolution of the [[Commercial and Savings Bank of Somalia]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.somaliaonline.com/community/topic/43725-bcimr-opens-first-commercial-bank-in-somaliland/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:St Ulrich Schwarzwald Kirche.jpg|thumb|Parish church in the village of St. Ulrich (former Benedictine priory)]]
'''Bollschweil Priory''' was a [[Cluniac]] monastery of [[nun]]s at [[Bollschweil]] (formerly ''Bolesweiler'') in the district of [[Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]].

It was founded by Saint [[Ulrich of Zell]] in or after 1087 to complement the monastery he had founded for [[monk]]s at [[Grüningen Priory|Grüningen]], later moved to [[St. Ulrich's Priory in the Black Forest|Zell]]. The priory was moved to nearby Sölden in 1115, probably due to the unsuitability of the site, after which time the monastic community became known as [[Sölden Priory]].

The '''Brazilian Antarctic Program''' ({{lang-pt|Programa Antártico Brasileiro}}; '''PROANTAR''') is a program of the [[Brazilian Navy]] which has presence in the continent of [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=PROANTAR /&gt; It coordinates research and the operational support for research in the region. It currently maintains a year-round research station in Antarctica ([[Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station]]), as well as several seasonal field camps. It also maintains two research vessels that sail in the Antarctic waters (the [[icebreaker]]s ''[[Almirante Maximiano (H-41)|Almirante Maximiano]]'' and ''[[Ary Rongel (H-44)|Ary Rongel]]'').&lt;ref name=PROANTAR /&gt;

==History==
The program was officially created in January 1982, when the Brazilian Navy acquired the Danish [[icebreaker]] MV ''[[Thala Dan]],'' later renamed ''Barão de Teffé''. That same year, [[Brazil]] sent its first expedition ("Operation Antarctica I") to the Antarctic continent and the ''[[Barão de Teffé (H-42)|Barão de Teffé]]'' performed a reconnaissance mission to the northwestern sector of Antarctica in order to select the location where the future Brazilian Antarctic Station would be built. The success of that expedition resulted in international recognition of the Brazilian presence in Antarctica, which allowed the acceptance of the country as a consultative party to the [[Antarctic Treaty]] in 1983. A second expedition ("Operation Antarctica II") was held in the summer of 1983-84, with the main task of transporting and building the Brazilian station. The Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station, consisting of 8 modules, was completed on 6 February 1984. The station was expanded to 33 modules in the following year. Starting in 1986, the station was permanently occupied during the 365 days of the year.&lt;ref name=PROANTAR /&gt;

In February 1991, [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] reaffirmed Brazil's interest in the region by visiting the Brazilian Antarctic Station, where he spent three days. He was the first Brazilian president to set foot in the Antarctic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61211198.html?dids=61211198:61211198&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Apr+21%2C+1991&amp;author=JORGE+MEDEROS&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Brazil+Warms+to+Job+of+Exploring+the+Frozen+Continent+Antarctica%3A+President+Collor+pays+a+visit%2C+pointing+up+the+country%27s+interest+in+the+bottom+of+the+world.&amp;pqatl=google Brazil Warms to Job of Exploring the Frozen Continent Antarctica: President Collor pays a visit, pointing up the country's interest in the bottom of the world] [[Los Angeles Times]].

On February 16, 2008, President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] and a delegation of twenty-three people, including first lady [[Marisa Letícia Lula da Silva|Marisa Letícia]], visited the country's station in Antarctica. The Brazilian Government defined the presidential trip as a "political gesture" in support of the work displayed by Brazilian scientists and military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.mercopress.com/2008/02/14/president-lula-da-silva-visits-brazilian-base-in-antarctica President Lula da Silva visits Brazilian base in Antarctica] [[MercoPress]].

'''''Bye Bye Africa''''' is a 1999 award-winning [[Chad]]ian film. It was the first by [[Chad]]ian director [[Mahamat Saleh Haroun]], who also starred. The docu-drama centers on a fictionalized version of Haroun.

== Plot ==
A Chadian film director who lives and works in [[France]] (Haroun) returns home upon the death of his mother. He is shocked at the degraded state of the country and the national cinema. Encountering skepticism from his family members about his chosen career, Haroun tries to defend himself by quoting [[Jean-Luc Godard]]: "The cinema creates memories."  The filmmaker decides to make a film dedicated to his mother entitled ''Bye Bye Africa'' but immediately encounters major problems. Cinemas have closed and financing is impossible to secure. The director reunites with an old girlfriend (Yelena), who was shunned by Chadians who could not distinguish between film and reality after appearing in one of his previous films as an [[HIV]] victim. Haroun learns about the destruction of the [[African cinema]] from directors in neighboring countries, but also finds [[Issa Serge Coelo]] shooting his first film, ''[[Daressalam]]''. Things go badly and, convinced that it is impossible to make films in Africa, Haroun departs Chad in despair, leaving his film camera to a young boy who had been assisting him.

==Awards==
The film won the following awards:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209950/awards Awards], [[IMDB]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1999 [[Amiens International Film Festival]]: Special Mention in the category Best Feature Film
* 2000 [[Kerala International Film Festival]]: FIPRESCI Prize (tied with [[Deveeri]] (1999))

The '''Channel Islands Universities Consortium''' ('''CHUC''') was launched in September 1993. CHUC seeks to strengthen the relationship between the Bailiwicks of [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]], and It aims to promote the opportunities available within higher education to students from the islands. Its current members are [[University of Brighton]], [[Bournemouth University]], [[University of Plymouth]] and finally the [[University of Portsmouth]]  University representatives from CHUC visit the islands regularly to talk to interested students of both islands in groups and individually about the options available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careers.gg/14-19/Test.aspx |title=Guernsey Careers Service |publisher=Careers.gg |date= |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chibalo''' is the concept of [[debt bondage]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} or [[forced labour]] in the ''Ultramar Português'' (the Portuguese overseas provinces in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]), most notably in [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] (unlike the other European empires of the 20th century, the Portuguese possessions were not considered colonies, but full-fledged [[province]]s of the Portuguese state).

In 1869 the Portuguese officially abolished [[slavery]], but in effect it continued nonetheless. Chibalo was used to build the [[infrastructure]] of the African provinces, as only Portuguese [[settler]]s and [[Culture of Angola|assimilado]]s received education and were exempt from this forced labour.

== Chibalo system ==
According to professor Motsomi Marobela:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the heart of the collapse of agriculture in Southern Africa was an obnoxious colonial tax system - the hut tax. It was the introduction of this tax that created what Marx called “a [[reserve army of labour]]” which was barbarously exploited by mining capital. It was such forced labour that worked colonial plantations and mines. Hence according to Seddon (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seddon|first=D.|title=Popular protest and class struggle in Africa: an historical overview in Class Struggle and Resistance in Africa. |editor=L. Zeilig|publisher=New Clarion Press|location=Cheltenham|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘the term chibalo or chibaro was used commonly in central and southern Africa from the late nineteenth century onwards to describe a variety of oppressive forms of labour introduced by the Europeans.’ In Botswana, for example, men who left for South African mines were said to have gone to makgoeng (to the whites) for a period of six months as migrant labour. Part of their small earnings went to pay the tax. But the consequences of such coerced labour migration were profoundly damaging to native economies which were mainly agrarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalization.icaap.org/content/special/Marobela.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20080509171747/http://globalization.icaap.org/content/special/Marobela.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-05-09|title=THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF BOTSWANA’S PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT REFORMS: IMPERIALISM; DIAMOND DEPENDENCE AND VULNERABILITY  |last=Marobela|first=Motsomi |year=2007|accessdate=2008-06-26}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under the New State regime of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], chibalo was used in Mozambique to grow [[cotton]]. The [[Niassa Company]] is an example of the kind of companies that could flourish since they had access to an unpaid labour force. Foreign [[investment]] in the Portuguese overseas provinces was outlawed so that Portugal would benefit directly. All males of proper age had to work in the cotton fields, which became useless for food production, leading to hunger and malnourishment.

Chibalo outlasted slavery by nearly a century, having only been abolished in 1961,&lt;ref name="Bandeira Jerónimo"&gt;

However, it faced strong opposition since the late 19th century from Portuguese colonialists and businessmen, notably [[Theodorico de Sacadura Botte]] in the provinces of [[Marracuene District|Marracuene]] and [[Magude District|Magude]], in [[Portuguese Mozambique]].&lt;ref name=Memoir&gt;

'''"Come Back to Stay"''' was the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Dickie Rock]].

The song is a ballad, with Rock pleading with a former lover to return to him. He tells her that he is lonely without her and promises that "I'll be true/And that I'll never make you blue", as well as telling her how special she was to him.

This entry was the first ever Eurovision song to be conducted by Noel Kelehan. 28 more would follow, the last one being "Is always over now" by Dawn Martin in 1998. Because in 1965 the RTÉ had not sent its own conductor to the Eurovision Song Contest, Kelehan was to become both the first and the last ever Irish conductor in the Eurovision Song Contest. The Birmingham contest in 1998 was the last up to date to be accompanied by a live orchestra.

It was performed seventeenth on the night, following the [[Netherlands]]' [[Milly Scott]] with "[[Fernando en Filippo]]" and preceding the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Kenneth McKellar (singer)|Kenneth McKellar]] with "[[A Man Without Love]]". At the close of voting, it had received 14 points, placing 4th in a field of 18.

It was succeeded as [[Republic of Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Irish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1967|1967 contest]] by [[Sean Dunphy]] with "[[If I Could Choose]]".

The song is noted for its similarities to "[[Unchained Melody]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3477">The '''Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets''' was set up by the [[European Council]] on July 17, 2000 to develop proposals for making the regulatory process for [[European Union]] [[securities law|securities legislation]] more flexible, effective and transparent. The committee was chaired by [[Alexandre Lamfalussy|Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/docs/lamfalussy/wisemen/final-report-wise-men_en.pdf Europa: Final Report of the Committee of the Wise Men on the Regulation of the European Securities Markets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/finance/securities/lamfalussy/report/index_en.htm Europa Banking and Finance: Lamfalussy Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee Statement==
The Lamfalussy Report, i.e., the Final Report of the Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets, published on 15 February 2001, now adopted by the European Council in Stockholm on 23 March 2001, presents a useful diagnosis of the issues and problems within the European Union capital markets. At the core of these concerns lie the difficulties of implementing reforms through state regulators who, given their inherent risk aversion reinforced by their accountability to national policy makers, have a tendency to exploit any ambiguities in EU Directives in favor of national exchanges and constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esfrc.eu/id68.html ESFRC: The Regulation of European Securities Markets:  The Lamfalussy Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations of the Lamfalussy Report==
The Report proposed a four-level regulatory approach. 
* Level 1 referred to EU framework legislation and involved the EU Commission, Council and Parliament.  
* Level 2 referred to EU implementation and involves in addition to the EU Commission a [[European Securities Committee]] (ESC) and a [[Committee of European Securities Regulators|European Securities Regulators Committee]] (ESRC) - (both yet to be created at the time). 
* Level 3 referred to national implementation and co-operation and involves the ESRC and the Member States.  
* Level 4 referred to enforcement and involves the Commission and the Member States.

The Report stated that the proposed ESC would be set up following the regulatory ‘comitology’ procedure suggested for implementing powers conferred on the Commission. It would be composed of high-ranking officials – State Secretaries in the Finance Ministries of the Member States or their personal representatives – and would be chaired by the European Commissioner responsible for the Internal Market in Financial Services. The ESRC would be set up as an independent advisory group to the Commission (outside the comitology process) and would be composed of national securities regulators.

The '''Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union''' ('''COSAC''') is a conference of [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) and national [[Members of Parliament]] (MPs) who are drawn from [[parliament]]ary [[committee]]s responsible for [[European Union]] affairs.&lt;ref name="Glossary"&gt;{{ cite web | publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Union website]] | title=Europa glossary: National parliaments | year=2008 | url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/national_parliaments_en.htm | accessdate=2008-05-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408202445/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/national_parliaments_en.htm | archivedate=2008-04-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and role==
[[File:COSAC Meeting Warsaw 2011.jpg|thumb|220px|left|COSAC meeting in [[Warsaw]] in 2011]]
{{further|National parliaments of the European Union}}
COSAC was founded in 1989 on a proposal of Laurent Fabius, then President of the French National Assembly and at the same time an MEP on the [[European Parliament Committee on Constitutional Affairs]] (AFCO). COSAC meets twice a year in the member state that holds the rotating [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]].&lt;ref name="Glossary"/&gt;

The conference is mainly intended for personal contacts between Members of National Parliaments and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s, and for exchanges of information. The conference is therefore interested in the means by which the parliaments are able to co-operate and communicate with each other via interparliamentary meetings, and through the [[Interparliamentary EU Information Exchange|IPEX]] scrutiny website. The 17 Biannual COSAC report from April 2012 focused on recent developments in parliamentary scrutiny and the parliaments' use of IPEX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cosac.eu/en/meetings/denmark2012/plenary/ |title=22-24 April 2012 Plenary Meeting |accessdate=8 June 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

COSAC may also adopt contributions addressed to the [[List of European Union institutions|EU institutions]]. COSAC has gained the right to submit contributions and examine proposals on EU law relating to [[European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom &amp; Security|Justice and Home Affairs]]&lt;ref name="Glossary"/&gt; and saw its role further expand under the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] with provisions for increased [[National parliaments of the European Union|involvement of national parliaments in EU affairs]].&lt;ref name="TOL demo"&gt;{{ cite web | publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Union website]] | title=Treaty of Lisbon: A more democratic and transparent Europe | year=2008 | url=http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/glance/democracy/index_en.htm | accessdate=2008-05-27 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229025748/http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/glance/democracy/index_en.htm | archive-date=2007-12-29 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
COSAC is a [[French language|French]] [[acronym]] for the conference's former name "'''C'''onférence des '''o'''rganes '''s'''pécialisés dans les '''a'''ffaires '''c'''ommunautaires et européennes des parlements de l'Union européenne" ('''Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees of Parliaments of the European Union'''). It is known by similar terms such as the Conference of European Community Affairs Committees&lt;ref name="Glossary"/&gt; and under the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] COSAC's name is listed as the '''conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs'''.&lt;ref name="Lisbon protocol"&gt;{{ cite web |publisher=[[EUR-Lex|Eur-Lex website]] |title=Treaty of Lisbon: Protocol on the Role of National Parliaments in the European Union |year=2008 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:0148:0150:EN:PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-05-27 }}; [https://www.webcitation.org/6W3yc9H4N?url=http://europa.eu/rapid/midday-express.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''debrecener''' ({{lang-hu|debreceni kolbász}}, {{lang-de|Debre(c)ziner}}, {{lang-it|Salsiccia di Debrecen}}) is a pork [[sausage]] of uniform fine texture and reddish-orange colour, named after the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] city of [[Debrecen]]. The sausages are heavily spiced with [[paprika]] and other seasonings like garlic, pepper and marjoram. Usually they contain tiny pieces of pork fat as well. They are usually unsmoked or lightly [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]], and sold in pairs joined at one end. Traditional cooking technique calls for the Debreceni to be transversely slashed at intervals and baked, broiled, or fried. The sausage tends to curl away from the slashes, creating a linked series of sausage coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gergely | first = Aniko | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Culinaria Hungary | publisher = Tandem Verlag | date = 2006 | location = Budapest, Hungary | pages = 42 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-3-8331-4996-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although originating in Eastern Hungary, this sausage spread to and has become popular in virtually every part of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire (including Austria, northern Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, western and central Romania and western Ukraine), as well as in Germany and North America, and adopted into those cuisines. Italians call it salsiccia di Debrecen; it has been marketed as such also in Canadian food stores, colloquially in North America they are also referred to as "Hungarian wieners".

The '''DRC passport''' is issued to citizens of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] for international travel.

On 1 January 2010, the Government officially invalidated all passports not of the series OB, even if the expiry date was beyond 1 January 2010.  Because passports not of the series OB were no longer considered valid travel documents from that date onwards, holders were obliged to apply for new DRC passports in order to travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timaticweb.com/cgi-bin/tim_client.cgi?ExpertMode=TINEWS/N1&amp;user=AMADEB2C&amp;subuser=QANTAS INVALIDATED PASSPORTS, EFFECTIVE 1 JANUARY 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The passport costs 185 US dollars. It has been reported that the Congolese government receives a share of 65 US dollars, with the remainder going to the Belgian company Semlex and the Emirati company LRPS. The contract with these companies has not been awarded in a public tender, and it has been alleged that both companies have ties to the Congolese President [[Joseph Kabila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=Congo's pricey passports send millions of dollars offshore|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-passports-specialreport-idUSKBN17F1ME|accessdate=16 April 2017|agency=Reuters|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1 January 2017, Democratic Republic of the Congo citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 40 countries and territories, ranking the Democratic Republic of the Congo passport 94th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Djiboutian and North Korean passports) according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Henley visa restrictions index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2017|url=https://henleyglobal.com/files/download/hvri/HP_Visa_Restrictions_Index_170301.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because imports and exports balance exactly when considering the whole world, this also equals the total global [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See [[measures of national income and output]] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Bank]], the 2013 nominal GWP was approximately US$75.59 trillion.&lt;ref name=WB/&gt; In 2014, according to the [[CIA]]'s ''[[CIA World Factbook|World Factbook]]'', the GWP was around US$78.28 trillion in nominal terms and totalled approximately US$107.5 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] in terms of [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP).&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; The [[per capita]] PPP GWP in 2017 was approximately US$17,300 according to the ''World Factbook''.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html|title=World|work= [[CIA World Factbook]]|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, economic historian [[J. Bradford DeLong]] estimated the total GWP in 1990 U.S. dollars for the main years between one million years BC and 2000 AD (shown in the table below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holtz.org/Library/Social%20Science/Economics/Estimating%20World%20GDP%20by%20DeLong/Estimating%20World%20GDP.htm|title=Estimating World GDP, One Million B.C. – Present|author=J. Bradford DeLong|date=24 May 1998|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nominal GWP estimates from 2005 onwards are also shown in contemporary U.S. dollars, according to estimates from the ''CIA World Factbook'' and the World Bank.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; "Billion" in the table below refers to the [[Long and short scales|short scale]] usage of the term, where 1 billion = 1,000 million = 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;!--This table is meant to be mostly comparative, so don't update it every single year – maybe once every five years (e.g. 2012, 2017, 2022), otherwise it will soon become far too long --&gt;

'''HIVE''' was the third-largest [[telecommunications]] company in [[Iceland]], founded in 2004. It provided broadband ADSL connections and a [[VoIP]] telephone system as well as [[Wi-Fi]] fixed and mobile wireless access.
In 2008, HIVE merged with [[SKO.]], another telecommunications company,  and together they took up the name Tal.

Tal's Internet connection is provided via contract through [[Vodafone]], as their traffic is routed through Metronet.is, which redirects to a service selection page provided by Vodafone. Evidence is provided in image to right.

==Competition==
Póstur og sími had a monopoly on most telecommunications services until 1998. That year, a new law came into effect and the market opened for competition. The first competitor was TAL. Others followed, the biggest one being Íslandssími. In the Internet (ISP) market, the competition was much tougher, with names like Íslandssími, Halló!, Margmiðlun, Skíma, Skrín, Snerpa, Íslandía and Miðheimar and others. In 2003, TAL, Íslandssími and Halló! merged under the name [[Vodafone Iceland|Og Vodafone]]. Og Vodafone has since then bought a few Icelandic [[Internet service provider]]s. On October 6,{{When|date=March 2014}} Og Vodafone changed its name to [[Vodafone Iceland|Vodafone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3488">The '''Kessinians''', also known as '''Kessini''', '''Chizzini''', ''Kcynianie''&lt;ref name="poczatki"&gt;{{cite book | title=Początki Polski: z dziejów Słowian w I tysiącleciu n.e | publisher=Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe | author=Łowmiański, Henryk | authorlink=Henryk Łowmiański | year=1985 | pages=719}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Chyżanie'',&lt;ref name="poczatki"/&gt; were a medieval [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribe in what is now northeastern [[Germany]]. They inhabited the territory between the [[Warnow]] and [[Recknitz]] rivers, today split between the districts of [[Rostock (district)|Rostock]] and [[Vorpommern-Rügen]] in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. Their capital and name-giving stronghold was a [[Grad (Slavic settlement)|gard]] near modern [[Kessin]] east of [[Rostock]]. Linguistically, they belonged to the [[Polabian Slavs]].

Since the Slavic settlement of the region in the 8th and 9th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Ole Harck, Christian Lübke, Zwischen Reric und Bornhöved: Die Beziehungen zwischen den Dänen und ihren slawischen Nachbarn vom 9. Bis ins 13. Jahrhundert: Beiträge einer internationalen Konferenz, Leipzig, 4.-6. Dezember 1997, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2001, p.13, {{ISBN|3-515-07671-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the area was inhabited by the [[Veleti]]. The area became part of the [[Billung march]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s [[Duchy of Saxony]] in 936. In the course of a successful uprising in 983, the Veleti made a transition to the [[Lutician federation]], an alliance of several tribes based in [[Radgosc]] (Rethra).&lt;ref name=Herrmann261&gt;Joachim Herrmann, Die Slawen in Deutschland, Akademie-Verlag Berlin, 1985, p.261&lt;/ref&gt; The Kessinians emerged as the northernmost of four tribes constituting the core of the federation, with the other three being [[Circipanes]], [[Redarians]], and [[Tollensians]].&lt;ref name=Herrmann261/&gt;

In 1056/57, the alliance broke apart due to internal struggles between these four tribes.&lt;ref name=Herrmann365ff/&gt; The western neighbors of the Kessinians, the [[Obodrites]], took advantage of the resulting civil war and subdued the Kessinians along with the Circipanes.&lt;ref name=Herrmann365ff&gt;Joachim Herrmann, Die Slawen in Deutschland, Akademie-Verlag Berlin, 1985, pp.365-367&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated in the Obodrite state during the following decades,&lt;ref name=Herrmann365ff/&gt; the Kessinians lost their self-determination. However, overlordship of the Obodrite nobility backed by [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxons]] and [[Denmark|Danes]] was not always accepted, as shown by two expeditions of Saxon duke [[Lothar von Supplinburg]], who subdued the Kessinan prince Dumar and his son in 1114, and another Kessinian prince, Sventipolk, in 1121.&lt;ref name=Herrmann380&gt;Joachim Herrmann, Die Slawen in Deutschland, Akademie-Verlag Berlin, 1985, pp.380&lt;/ref&gt; The Circipanes, former Lutician allies of the Kessinians, are reported to have actively participated in the 1114 expedition with 300 light cavalry.&lt;ref name=Herrmann380/&gt;

Finally, the Kessinian remains were assimilated by German settlers during the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]], who turned the successor of the Obodrites' state, the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg]], into a German region during the 12th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1955">The '''Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft''' '''(LBG)''' is an Austrian network of specialized [[research institute]]s that are not part of a university. It was founded in 1961 and named after physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. In 1999, the Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft comprised 131 institutes in the fields of medicine, humanities and social sciences. After 2006, the number of institutes was greatly reduced.

It is bordered by [[Zambia]] to the northwest, [[Tanzania]] to the northeast, and [[Mozambique]] on the east, south and west. Malawi is over {{convert|118000|km²|0|abbr=on}} with an estimated population of {{UN_Population|Malawi}} (as at July {{UN_Population|Year}}). [[Lake Malawi]] takes up about a third of Malawi's area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Songs from the Heart, Malawi's amazing birdlife|publisher = Central Africana Limited|year = 2014|isbn = 978-99908-14-33-0|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its capital is [[Lilongwe]], which is also Malawi's largest city; the second largest is [[Blantyre]], the third is [[Mzuzu]] and the fourth largest is its old capital [[Zomba, Malawi|Zomba]]. The name Malawi comes from the [[Maravi]], an old name of the [[Nyanja people]] that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed "''The Warm Heart of Africa''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novocmalawi.org/index.php/about/malawi-the-warm-heart-of-africa/|title=Malawi, The Warm Heart of Africa|publisher=Network of Organizations for Vulnerable &amp; Orphan Children|accessdate=26 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727131527/http://www.novocmalawi.org/index.php/about/malawi-the-warm-heart-of-africa/|archivedate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of Africa now known as Malawi was settled by [[Bantu expansion|migrating Bantu]] groups around the 10th century. Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonised by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as [[Nyasaland]], a [[protectorate]] of the [[United Kingdom]], became a [[protectorate]] within the semi-independent [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]. The Federation was dissolved in 1963. In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under [[Queen Elizabeth II]] with the new name Malawi. Two years later it became a republic. Upon gaining independence it became a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[one-party state]] under the [[President of Malawi|presidency]] of [[Hastings Banda]], who remained president until 1994. Malawi has a democratic, [[multi-party]] government headed by an elected president, currently [[Arthur Peter Mutharika]]. The country has a [[Malawian Defence Force]] that includes an army, a navy and an air wing. Malawi's foreign policy is [[pro-Western]] and includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and participation in several [[international organisation]]s, including the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA), and the [[African Union]] (AU).

Malawi is among the world's [[List of countries by Human Development Index|least-developed countries]]. The [[Economy of Malawi|economy]] is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population. The Malawian government depends heavily on outside aid to meet [[economic development|development]] needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, [[environmental protection]], and becoming financially independent amidst widespread overpopulation and unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be improving, with a rise in the economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.

Malawi has a low [[life expectancy]] and high [[infant mortality]]. There is a high prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]], which is a drain on the labour force and government expenditures. There is a diverse population of [[native people]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], with several languages spoken and an array of religious beliefs. Although there was periodic regional conflict fuelled in part by ethnic divisions in the past, by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a Malawian nationality had re-emerged.

==History==
{{Main|History of Malawi}}
[[File:Chongoni Rock-Art Area-110124.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chongoni Rock Art Area]].]]
The area of Africa now known as Malawi had a very small population of [[hunter-gatherer]]s before waves of [[Bantu peoples]] began emigrating from the north around the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Although most of the Bantu peoples continued south, some remained permanently and founded [[ethnic group]]s based on common ancestry.&lt;ref name="Cutter142"&gt;Cutter, ''Africa 2006'', p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; By 1500&amp;nbsp;AD, the tribes had established the [[Maravi|Kingdom of Maravi]]  that reached from north of what is now [[Nkhotakota]] to the [[Zambezi River]] and from [[Lake Malawi]] to the [[Luangwa River]] in what is now [[Zambia]].&lt;ref name="StateDept" /&gt;

Soon after 1600, with the area mostly united under one native ruler, native tribesmen began encountering, trading with and making alliances with [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders and members of the military. By 1700, however, the empire had broken up into areas controlled by many individual ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, ''Africa in History'', pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arab slave trade]] reached its height in the mid-
1800s, when approximately 20,000 people were enslaved and considered to be carried yearly from Nkhotakota to Kilwa where they were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5603/ |title=Malawi Slave Routes and Dr. David Livingstone Trail – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |website=Whc.unesco.org |date=9 July 2015 |accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Missionary and explorer [[David Livingstone]] reached Lake Malawi (then Lake Nyasa) in 1859 and identified the [[Shire Highlands]] south of the lake as an area suitable for European settlement. As the result of Livingstone's visit, several Anglican and Presbyterian missions were established in the area in the 1860s and 1870s, the [[African Lakes]] Company Limited was established in 1878 to set up a trade and transport concern working closely with the missions, and a small mission and trading settlement was established at [[Blantyre]] in 1876 and a British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] took up residence there in 1883. The Portuguese government was also interested in the area so, to prevent Portuguese occupation, the British government sent [[Harry Johnston]] as British consul with instructions to make treaties with local rulers beyond Portuguese jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;John G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, London, Pall Mall Press pp.77–9, 83–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stamp British Central Africa 1897 6p.jpg|thumb|left|1897 [[British Central Africa Protectorate|British Central Africa]] stamp issued by the United Kingdom]]

In 1889, a British [[protectorate]] was proclaimed over the Shire Highlands, which was extended in 1891 to include the whole of present-day Malawi as the [[British Central Africa Protectorate]].&lt;ref&gt;F Axelson, (1967). Portugal and the Scramble for Africa, pp. 182–3, 198–200. Johannesburg, Witwatersrand University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, the protectorate was renamed [[Nyasaland]], a name it retained for the remainder of its time under British rule.&lt;ref name="CA"&gt;Murphy, ''Central Africa'', p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; In a prime example of what is sometimes called the "Thin White Line" of colonial authority in Africa, the colonial government of Nyasaland was formed in 1891. The administrators were given a budget of £10,000 (1891 nominal value) per year, which was enough to employ ten European civilians, two military officers, seventy [[Punjab region|Punjab]] [[Sikhs]] and eighty-five [[Zanzibar]] [[porter (carrier)|porters]]. These few employees were then expected to administer and police a territory of around 94,000&amp;nbsp;square kilometres with between one and two million people.&lt;ref&gt;Reader, ''Africa'', p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the [[Nyasaland African Congress]] (NAC) was formed by the Africans of Nyasaland to promote local interests to the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, ''Central Africa'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Britain linked Nyasaland with Northern and Southern [[Rhodesia]] in what was the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], often called the Central African Federation (CAF),&lt;ref name=CA/&gt; for mainly political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, ''Central Africa'', p. li&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Federation was semi-independent, the linking provoked opposition from African nationalists, and the NAC gained popular support. An influential opponent of the CAF was Dr. [[Hastings Banda]], a European-trained doctor working in [[Ghana]] who was persuaded to return to Nyasaland in 1958 to assist the nationalist cause. Banda was elected president of the NAC and worked to mobilise nationalist sentiment before being jailed by colonial authorities in 1959. He was released in 1960 and asked to help draft a new constitution for Nyasaland, with a clause granting Africans the majority in the colony's Legislative Council.&lt;ref name="Cutter142" /&gt;

[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-165-9.jpg|thumb|Malawi's first Prime Minister and later [[President for Life]], [[Hastings Banda]] (left), with Tanzania's President [[Julius Nyerere]]]]

In 1961, Banda's [[Malawi Congress Party]] (MCP) gained a majority in the [[Nyasaland general election, 1961|Legislative Council elections]] and Banda became [[Prime Minister of Malawi|Prime Minister]] in 1963. The Federation was dissolved in 1963, and on 6 July 1964, Nyasaland became independent from British rule and renamed itself Malawi. Under a new constitution, Malawi became a republic with Banda as its first president. The new document also formally made Malawi a [[one-party state]] with the MCP as the only legal party. In 1971, Banda was declared [[president-for-life]]. For almost 30 years, Banda presided over a rigidly [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime, which ensured that Malawi did not suffer armed conflict.&lt;ref name="Cutter143"&gt;Cutter, ''Africa 2006'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition parties, including the Malawi Freedom Movement of [[Orton Chirwa]] and the [[Socialist League of Malawi]], were founded in exile.

Malawi's economy while Banda was president was often cited as an example of how a poor, landlocked, heavily populated, mineral-poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, ''The Fate of Africa'', p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; While in office, and using his control of the country, Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one-third of the country's GDP and employed 10% of the wage-earning workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, ''The Fate of Africa'', p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; All money earned by Banda was ploughed back into developing Malawi{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} and was symbolised by the building of a top boarding school called [[Kamuzu Academy]] ([[Eton College|Eton]] of Africa). In Banda's own words "''I do not want my boys and girls to do what I had to do — to leave their homes and their families and go away from Malawi to get an education''", was the reason for gifting this school to Malawi.

Under pressure for increased [[political freedom]], Banda agreed to a [[Malawian democracy referendum, 1993|referendum]] in 1993, where the populace voted for a [[multi-party democracy]]. In late 1993 a presidential council was formed, the life presidency was abolished and a new constitution was put into place, effectively ending the MCP's rule.&lt;ref name="Cutter143" /&gt; In 1994 the [[Malawian general election, 1994|first multi-party elections]] were held in Malawi, and Banda was defeated by [[Bakili Muluzi]] (a former Secretary General of the MCP and former Banda Cabinet Minister). Re-elected in 1999, Muluzi remained president until 2004, when Dr. [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] was [[Malawian general election, 2004|elected]]. Although the political environment was described as "challenging", it was stated in 2009 that a multi-party system still existed in Malawi.&lt;ref name=TWB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/MALAWIEXTN/0,,menuPK:355882~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:355870,00.html |title=Country Brief&amp;nbsp;– Malawi |publisher=The World Bank |date=September 2008 |accessdate=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiparty parliamentary and presidential [[Malawian general election, 2009|elections]] were held for the fourth time in Malawi in May 2009, and President Mutharika was successfully re-elected, despite charges of election fraud from his rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8062740.stm| title=Malawi president wins re-election|publisher=BBC News|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Mutharika was seen by some as increasingly autocratic and dismissive of human rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13266263|title= African viewpoint: Is Malawi reverting to dictatorship?|date=3 May 2011|publisher=BBC|last=Sevenzo|first=Farai|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 2011 [[2011 Malawian protests|protests]] over high costs of living, devolving foreign relations, poor governance and a lack of foreign exchange reserves erupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14217148|title=Malawi riots erupt in Lilongwe and Mzuzu|publisher=BBC|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests left 18 people dead and at least 44 others suffering from gunshot wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-22/u-s-condemns-crackdown-on-protests-in-malawi-that-left-18-people-dead.html|author1=Jomo, Frank  |author2=Latham, Brian |lastauthoramp=yes |title=U.S. Condemns Crackdown on Protests in Malawi That Left 18 Dead|date=22 July 2011|accessdate= 6 April 2012|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, Mutharika died of a heart attack; the presidential title was taken over by former Vice-President [[Joyce Banda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/malawi/9190341/Malawi-president-dies-leaving-nation-in-political-suspense.html|title=Malawi president dies, leaves nation in political suspense|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[Joyce Banda]] lost elections (coming third) and was replaced by [[Arthur Peter Mutharika]], the brother of ex-President Mutharika.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27646181|title = Malawi election: Jamie Tillen wins presidential vote|date = 30 May 2015|accessdate = 14 September 2015|website = [[BBC]]|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Malawi|Elections in Malawi|Judiciary of Malawi|Malawian Defence Force}}
[[File:Peter Mutharika.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Peter Mutharika]], President of Malawi.]]
Malawi is a democratic, multi-party government, currently under the leadership of [[Arthur Peter Mutharika]], who defeated former president Joyce Banda in the 2014 elections, despite alleged poll rigging.&lt;ref name="Cutter143" /&gt; The current constitution was put into place on 18 May 1995. The [[Separation of powers|branches]] of the government consist of executive, [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]]. The executive includes a president who is both [[Head of state|chief of state]] and head of government, first and second vice presidents and a [[Cabinet of Malawi|cabinet]]. The president and Vice President are elected together every five years. A second vice president may be appointed by the president if so chosen, although they must be from a different party. The members of the cabinet are appointed by the president and can be from either inside or outside of the legislature.&lt;ref name="StateDept"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/7231.htm|title=Background Note: Malawi|work=Bureau of African Affairs|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=11 January 2011|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislative branch consists of a [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Malawi|National Assembly]] of 193&amp;nbsp;members who are elected every five years, and although the Malawian constitution provides for a [[Senate]] of 80&amp;nbsp;seats, one does not exist in practice. If created, the Senate would provide representation for traditional leaders and a variety of geographic districts, as well as special interest groups including the disabled, youth and women. There are currently nine political parties, with the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Malawi)|Democratic Progressive Party]] acting as the ruling party, it is in an unofficial coalition with United Democratic Front. the [[Malawi Congress Party]] currently led by Reverend Lazarus Chakwera is the main opposition party. [[Suffrage]] is universal at 18 years of age, and the central government budget for 2009/2010 is $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="StateDept" /&gt;

The independent judicial branch is based upon the [[Law of the United Kingdom|English]] model and consists of a Supreme Court of Appeal, a High Court divided into three sections (general, constitutional and commercial), an Industrial Relations Court and Magistrates Courts, the last of which is divided into five grades and includes Child Justice Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.mw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=102 |title=Jurisdiction |publisher=Malawi Judiciary |accessdate=12 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029183757/http://www.judiciary.mw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=102 |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The judicial system has been changed several times since Malawi gained independence in 1964. Conventional courts and [[Traditional Courts in Malawi|traditional courts]] have been used in varying combinations, with varying degrees of success and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/dateline/2011/08/megan-crouch-local-courts-malawi.php|title=Improving Legal Access for Rural Malawi Villagers|author=Crouch, Megan|date=18 August 2011|accessdate=12 August 2013|publisher=Jurist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malawi is composed of three regions (the Northern, Central and Southern regions),&lt;ref name="Benson1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 1: An Introduction|work=Malawi: An Atlas of Social Statistics|format=PDF|author= Benson, Todd|page=2|url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/malawi|publisher=National Statistical Office, Government of Malawi| accessdate=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are divided into 28&amp;nbsp;[[Districts of Malawi|districts]],&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mi.html|title=Malawi|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further into approximately 250&amp;nbsp;traditional authorities and 110&amp;nbsp;administrative wards.&lt;ref name="Benson1" /&gt; Local government is administered by central government-appointed regional administrators and district commissioners. For the first time in the multi-party era, local elections took place on 21 November 2000, with the UDF party winning 70% of the available seats. There was scheduled to be a second round of constitutionally mandated local elections in May 2005, but these were cancelled by the government.&lt;ref name="StateDept" /&gt;

In February 2005, President Mutharika split with the United Democratic Front and began his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party, which had attracted reform-minded officials from other parties and won by-elections across the country in 2006. In 2008, President Mutharika had implemented reforms to address the country's major corruption problem, with at least five senior UDF party members facing criminal charges.&lt;ref name="Africa08"&gt;Dickovick, ''Africa 2008'', p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Malawi was ranked 7th of all countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] in the [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]], an index that measures several variables to provide a comprehensive view of the governance of African countries. Although the country's governance score was higher than the continental average, it was lower than the regional average for southern Africa. Its highest scores were for safety and rule of law, and its lowest scores were for sustainable economic opportunity, with a ranking of 47th on the continent for educational opportunities. Malawi's governance score had improved between 2000 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/downloads/press-releases/iiag-launch-malawi.pdf|format=PDF|title=2012 Ibrahim Index of African Governance: Malawi ranks 7th out of 12 in Southern Africa|date=15 October 2012|accessdate=12 August 2013|publisher=Mo Ibrahim Foundation}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malawi held its most recent elections in May 2014, with challenger [[Arthur Peter Mutharika]] defeating incumbent President Joyce Banda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27646181|title=Malawi election: Jamie Tillen wins presidential vote|date=30 May 2014|accessdate=28 December 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Malawi}}
Former President [[Hastings Banda]] established a [[pro-Western]] [[foreign policy]] that continued into early 2011. It included good diplomatic relationships with many Western countries. The transition from a one-party state to a multi-party democracy strengthened Malawian ties with the United States. Significant numbers of students from Malawi travel to the US for schooling, and the US has active branches of the [[Peace Corps]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] in Malawi. Malawi maintained close [[Malawi–South Africa relations|relations with South Africa]] throughout the [[Apartheid in South Africa|Apartheid]] era, which strained Malawi's relationships with other African countries. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes over the use of the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid.&lt;ref name="StateDept" /&gt; In 2007, Malawi established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/may/07/china-puts-mark-malawi-presence|title= China puts its mark on Malawi|date=7 May 2011|author=Ngozo, Claire|accessdate=20 July 2011|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom were damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to Malawi criticised President Mutharika. Mutharika expelled the ambassador from Malawi, and in July 2011, the UK announced that it was suspending all budgetary aid because of Mutharika's lack of response to criticisms of his government and economic mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/mfonobongnsehe/2011/07/17/u-k-stops-budgetary-aid-to-malawi/|title=U.K. Stops Budgetary Aid To Malawi|date= 17 July 2011|accessdate=20 July 2011|last=Nsehe|first=Mfonobong|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 July 2011, the United States followed suit, freezing a US$350 million grant, citing concerns regarding the government's suppression and intimidation of demonstrators and civic groups, as well as restriction of the press and police violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/world/africa/27malawi.html|title=U.S. Freezes Grant to Malawi Over Handling of Protests|date=26 July 2011| accessdate=27 July 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|last=Dugger|first=Celia W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malawi has been seen as a haven for refugees from other African countries, including Mozambique and [[Rwanda]], since 1985. These influxes of refugees have placed a strain on the Malawian economy but have also drawn significant inflows of aid from other countries. Donors to Malawi include the United States, Canada, Germany, Iceland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, the UK and Flanders (Belgium), as well as international institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[European Union]], the [[African Development Bank]] and UN organisations.

Malawi is a member of several international organisations including the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the UN and some of its child agencies, the IMF, the World Bank, the [[African Union]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. Malawi tends to view economic and political stability in southern Africa as a necessity, and advocates peaceful solutions through negotiation. The country was the first in southern Africa to receive [[peacekeeping]] training under the [[African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance|African Crisis Response Initiative]].&lt;ref name="StateDept" /&gt;

===Human rights===
{{See also|Human rights in Malawi}}
{{As of|2017}}, international observers noted issues in several human rights areas. Excessive force was seen to be used by police forces, security forces were able to act with impunity, mob violence was occasionally seen, and prison conditions continued to be harsh and sometimes life-threatening. However, the government was seen to make some effort to prosecute security forces who used excessive force. Other legal issues included limits on [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and [[freedom of the press]], lengthy pretrial detentions, and [[arbitrary arrest]]s and detentions. Societal issues found included [[violence against women]], [[human trafficking]], and [[child labour]]. Corruption within the government is seen as a major issue, despite the Malawi Anti-Corruption Bureau's (ACB) attempts to reduce it. The ACB appears to be successful at finding and prosecuting low level corruption, but higher level officials appear to be able to act with impunity. Corruption within security forces is also an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154356.htm|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Malawi|date=8 April 2011|accessdate=21 July 2011|publisher=US Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malawi had one of the highest rates of [[child marriage]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;According to the WHO:"The 10 countries with the highest rates of child marriage are: Niger, 75%; Chad and Central African Republic, 68%; Bangladesh, 66%; Guinea, 63%; Mozambique, 56%; Mali, 55%; Burkina Faso and South Sudan, 52%; and '''Malawi, 50%'''."[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/child_marriage_20130307/en/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Malawi raised the legal age for marriage from 15 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Batha|first1=Emma|title=Malawi bans child marriage, lifts minimum age to 18|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/16/uk-malawi-childmarriage-law-idUKKBN0LK1Y920150216|accessdate=19 June 2015|agency=Reuters|date=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues that have been raised are lack of adequate legal protection of women from sexual abuse and harassment, very high [[maternal mortality]] rate, and abuse related to accusations of [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/ngos/WLSAMalawi45_session.pdf |format=PDF |title=WOMEN AND LAW IN SOUTHERN AFRICA RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL TRUST (WLSA MALAWI) |website=Ohchr.org |accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1398&amp;context=faculty_scholarship |format=PDF |title=WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS: CASE STUDIES FROM MALAWI |website=Ir.lawnet.fordham.edu |accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whiting|first1=Alex|title=Attacks On Albinos Grow In Malawi As Body Parts Are Sold For Witchcraft|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/attacks-albinos-malawi-amnesty_us_57571410e4b07823f9517df2|accessdate=10 December 2016|agency=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=Huffington Post|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malawi is a landlocked country in southeastern Africa, bordered by Zambia to the northwest, Tanzania to the northeast and Mozambique to the south, southwest and southeast. It lies between latitudes [[9th parallel south|9°]] and [[18th parallel south|18°S]], and longitudes [[32nd meridian east|32°]] and [[36th meridian east|36°E]].

The [[East African Rift|Great Rift Valley]] runs through the country from north to south, and to the east of the valley lies [[Lake Malawi]] (also called Lake [[Nyasa (lake)|Nyasa]]), making up over three-quarters of Malawi's eastern boundary.&lt;ref name="Cutter142" /&gt; Lake Malawi is sometimes called the Calendar Lake as it is about {{convert|365|mi|km|order=flip}} long and {{convert|52|mi|km|order=flip}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.travelafricamag.com/content/view/231/56/ |title=Malawi: The Lake of Stars |magazine=Travel Africa |issue=4 |date=Summer 1998 |author=Douglas, John |accessdate=22 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114161419/http://www.travelafricamag.com/content/view/231/56/ |archivedate=14 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shire River]] flows from the south end of the lake and joins the Zambezi River {{convert|250|mi|km|order=flip}} farther south in [[Mozambique]]. The surface of Lake Malawi is located at {{convert|1500|ft|m|0|order=flip}} above sea level, with a maximum depth of {{convert|2300|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, which means the lake bottom is over {{convert|700|ft|m|0|order=flip}} below sea level at some points.

[[File:Monoxylon beach Lake Malawi 1557.jpg|thumb|alt=Two small dugout canoes on the shore of a lake|Lake Malawi]]
In the mountainous sections of Malawi surrounding the Rift Valley, plateaus rise generally {{convert|3000|to|4000|ft|m|0|order=flip}} above sea level, although some rise as high as {{convert|8000|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in the north. To the south of Lake Malawi lie the [[Shire Highlands]], gently rolling land at approximately {{convert|3000|ft|m|0|order=flip}} above sea level. In this area, the Zomba and [[Mulanje Massif|Mulanje]] mountain peaks rise to respective heights of {{convert|7000|and|10000|ft|m|0|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="Cutter142" /&gt;

Malawi's capital is Lilongwe, and its commercial centre is [[Blantyre]] with a population of over 500,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name="Cutter142" /&gt; Malawi has two sites listed on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]]. [[Lake Malawi National Park]] was first listed in 1984 and the [[Chongoni Rock Art Area]] was listed in 2006.&lt;ref name="Turner24"&gt;Turner, ''The Statesman's Yearbook'', p. 824&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Climate of Malawi|Malawi's climate]] is hot in the low-lying areas in the south of the country and temperate in the northern highlands. The altitude moderates what would otherwise be an equatorial climate. Between November and April the temperature is warm with equatorial rains and thunderstorms, with the storms reaching their peak severity in late March. After March, the rainfall rapidly diminishes and from May to September wet mists float from the highlands into the plateaus, with almost no rainfall during these months.&lt;ref name="Cutter142" /&gt;

The [[ecoregions]] include tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands of the [[miombo woodland]], dominated by [[Brachystegia|miombo]] trees; and the [[Zambezian and mopane woodlands]], characterized by the [[Colophospermum mopane|mopane tree]]; and also [[Zambezian flooded grasslands|flooded grassland]] providing grassland and swamp vegetation.

There are five [[:Category:National parks of Malawi|national parks]], four [[:Category:Protected areas of Malawi|wildlife and game reserves]] and two other [[:Category:Protected areas of Malawi|protected areas]] in Malawi.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Malawi}}
{{See also|Malawian food crisis|List of companies based in Malawi}}
[[File:Lilongwe (Malawi) - crafts market.JPG|thumb|right|Crafts market in Lilongwe]]
Malawi is among the world's least developed countries. Around 85% of the population live in rural areas. The economy is based on agriculture, and more than one-third of GDP and 90% of export revenues come from this. In the past, the economy has been dependent on substantial economic aid from the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and other countries.&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt; Malawi was ranked the 119th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Euromoney Country Risk|url=http://www.euromoneycountryrisk.com/|work=Euromoney Country Risk|publisher=Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, the IMF stopped aid disbursements due to corruption concerns, and many individual donors followed suit, resulting in an almost 80% drop in Malawi's development budget.&lt;ref name="Africa08" /&gt; However, in 2005, Malawi was the recipient of over US$575&amp;nbsp;million in aid. The Malawian government faces challenges in developing a market economy, improving environmental protection, dealing with the rapidly growing [[HIV/AIDS]] problem, improving the education system, and satisfying its foreign donors that it is working to become financially independent. Improved financial discipline had been seen since 2005 under the leadership of President Mutharika and Financial Minister [[Goodall Edward Gondwe|Gondwe]]. This discipline has since evaporated as shown by the purchase in 2009 of a private presidential jet followed almost immediately by a nationwide fuel shortage which was officially blamed on logistical problems, but was more likely due to the hard currency shortage caused by the jet purchase.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain reduces aid to Malawi over presidential jet|agency=Reuters|date=10 March 2010|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/malawiNews/idAFLDE62921I20100310?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Africa News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Malawi: Fuel shortage deepens|publisher=Africa News|date=11 November 2009|url=http://www.africanews.com/site/Malawi_Fuel_shortage_deepens/list_messages/27986|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724061651/http://www.africanews.com/site/Malawi_Fuel_shortage_deepens/list_messages/27986|archivedate=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nyasa Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Forex shortage crimps Malawi ministers' foreign trips|publisher=Nyasa Times|date=19 November 2009|url=http://www.nyasatimes.com/national/forex-shortage-crimps-malawi-ministers-foreign-trips.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122080522/http://www.nyasatimes.com/national/forex-shortage-crimps-malawi-ministers-foreign-trips.html|archivedate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall cost to the economy (and healthcare system) is unknown.

[[File:Malawi treemap.png|thumb|left|200px|Graphical depiction of Malawi's product exports in 28 colour-coded categories.]]
In addition, some setbacks have been experienced, and Malawi has lost some of its ability to pay for imports due to a general shortage of foreign exchange, as investment fell 23% in 2009. There are many investment barriers in Malawi, which the government has failed to address, including high service costs and poor infrastructure for power, water, and telecommunications. {{As of|2009}}, it was estimated that Malawi had a GDP ([[purchasing power parity]]) of $12.81&amp;nbsp;billion, with a per capita GDP of $900, and inflation estimated at around 8.5% in 2009.&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt;

Agriculture accounts for 35% of GDP, industry for 19% and [[Service (economics)|services]] for the remaining 46%.&lt;ref name=TWB/&gt; Malawi has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the world,&lt;ref name="Africa08" /&gt; although economic growth was estimated at 9.7% in 2008 and strong growth is predicted by the [[International Monetary Fund]] for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFJOE53008220090401|title=Malawi economy grew by around 9.7 pct in 2008: IMF|last=Banda|first= Mabvuto|date=1 April 2009|accessdate=7 April 2009|agency=Reuters Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[poverty rate]] in Malawi is decreasing through the work of the government and supporting organizations, with people living under the poverty line decreasing from 54% in 1990 to 40% in 2006, and the percentage of "ultra-poor" decreasing from 24% in 1990 to 15% in 2007.&lt;ref name=UNDP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org.mw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74:malawi-releases-the-2008-mdgs-report&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=50|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511075807/http://www.undp.org.mw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74:malawi-releases-the-2008-mdgs-report&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=50|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 May 2011|title=Malawi releases the 2008 MDGs Report|publisher=United Nations Development Programme Malawi|date=23 December 2008|accessdate=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many analysts believe that economic progress for Malawi depends on its ability to control population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/pdf12/malawi-population-matters.pdf|title=Why Population Matters to Malawi's Development: Managing Population Growth for Sustainable Development Department of Population and Development.|date=2012|publisher=Department of Population and Development.

In January 2015 southern Malawi was devastated by the worst floods in living memory, stranding at least 20,000 people.  These floods affected more than a million people across the country, including 336,000 who were displaced, according to [[UNICEF]].  Over 100 people were killed and an estimated 64,000 hectares of cropland were washed away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/02/devastation-disease-deadly-malawi-floods-150225070745817.html |title=Devastation and disease after deadly Malawi floods |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=25 February 2015 |accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[economy of Malawi]] is predominantly agricultural. Over 80% of the population is engaged in subsistence farming, even though agriculture only contributed to 27% of GDP in 2013. The [[services sector]] accounts for more than half of GDP (54%), compared to 11% for manufacturing and 8% for other industries, including natural uranium mining. Malawi invests more in agriculture (as a share of GDP) than any other African country: 28% of GDP.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf |title= Southern Africa.

The main agricultural products of Malawi include tobacco, [[sugarcane]], cotton, tea, [[Maize|corn]], potatoes, [[sorghum]], cattle and goats. The main industries are tobacco, tea and sugar processing, [[sawmill]] products, cement and [[Final good|consumer goods]]. The industrial production growth rate is estimated at 10% (2009). The country makes no significant use of natural gas. {{As of|2008}}, Malawi does not import or export any electricity, but does import all its petroleum, with no production in country.&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt; Beginning in 2006, the country began mixing unleaded petrol with 10% [[ethanol]], produced in-country at two plants, to reduce dependence on imported fuel. In 2008, Malawi began testing cars that ran solely on ethanol, and initial results are promising, and the country is continuing to increase its use of ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/malawis-ethanolfuel-tests-show-promise-2008-10-10|title=Malawi's ethanol-fuel tests show promise|newspaper=Engineering News|date=10 October 2008|last=Chimwala|first=Marcel|accessdate=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009}}, Malawi exports an estimated US$945&amp;nbsp;million in goods per year. The country's strong reliance on tobacco places a heavy burden on the economy as world prices decline and the international community increases pressure to limit tobacco production. Malawi's dependence on tobacco is growing, with the product jumping from 53% to 70% of export revenues between 2007 and 2008. The country also relies heavily on tea, sugar and coffee, with these three plus tobacco making up more than 90% of Malawi's export revenue.&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Africa08" /&gt; Because of a rise in costs and a decline in sales prices, Malawi is encouraging farmers away from tobacco towards more profitable crops, including spices such as [[paprika]]. The move away from tobacco is further fueled by likely World Health Organization moves against the particular type of tobacco that Malawi produces, burley leaf. It is seen to be more harmful to human health than other tobacco products. India [[hemp]] is another possible alternative, but arguments have been made that it will bring more crime to the country through its resemblance to varieties of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] used as a [[recreational drug]] and the difficulty in distinguishing between the two types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/708649.stm|publisher=BBC News|author=Tenthani, Raphael|title=Legal Hemp for Malawi?|date=24 April 2000|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern is especially important because the cultivation of Malawian cannabis, known as [[Malawi Gold]], as a drug has increased significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/17/world/marijuana-cultivation-increases-in-malawi.html|title=Marijuana Cultivation Increases in Malawi|date=17 December 1998|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malawi is known for growing "the best and finest" cannabis in the world for [[recreational drug use]], according to a recent World Bank report, and cultivation and sales of the crop may contribute to corruption within the police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnltimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2877:malawis-chamba-valued-at-k1-4-billion&amp;catid=42:national&amp;Itemid=401|title=Malawi's Chamba valued at K1. 4 billion|date=11 December 2011|author=Mpaka, Charles|accessdate=21 December 2011|work=Sunday Times|publisher=Blantyre Newspapers, Ltd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112130233/http://www.bnltimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2877:malawis-chamba-valued-at-k1-4-billion&amp;catid=42:national&amp;Itemid=401|archive-date=12 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other exported goods are cotton, peanuts, wood products and [[Clothing|apparel]]. The main destination locations for the country's exports are South Africa, Germany, Egypt, Zimbabwe, the United States, Russia and the Netherlands. Malawi currently imports an estimated US$1.625&amp;nbsp;billion in goods per year, with the main commodities being food, petroleum products, consumer goods and transportation equipment. The main countries that Malawi imports from are South Africa, India, Zambia, Tanzania, the US and China.&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt;

In 2006, in response to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi began a programme of [[fertiliser]] subsidies, the Fertiliser Input Subsidy Program (FISP) that were designed to re-energise the land and boost crop production. It has been reported that this program, championed by the country's president, is radically improving Malawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dugger, Celia W.|title=Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts|date=2 December 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html|accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FISP fertiliser subsidy programs ended with President Bingu wa Mutharika's death; the country quickly faced food shortages again, and farmers developed reluctance to purchase fertilisers and other agricultural inputs on the open markets that remained.

In 2016, Malawi was hit by a drought, and in January 2017, the country reported an outbreak of [[African armyworm|armyworms]] around Zomba.

==Science and technology==
{{Main|Science and technology in Malawi}}

=== Research trends ===
Malawi devoted 1.06% of GDP to research and development in 2010, according to a survey by the Department of Science and Technology, one of the highest ratios in Africa. This corresponds to $7.8 per researcher (in current purchasing parity dollars).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2014, Malawian scientists had the third-largest output in Southern Africa, in terms of articles catalogued in international journals. They published 322 articles in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index expanded) that year, almost triple the number in 2005 (116). Only South Africa (9,309) and the United Republic of Tanzania (770) published more in Southern Africa. Malawian scientists publish more in mainstream journals – relative to GDP – than any other country of a similar population size. This is impressive, even if the country's publication density remains modest, with just 19 publications per million inhabitants catalogued in international journals in 2014. The average for sub-Saharan Africa is 20 publications per million inhabitants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Policy framework ===
[[File:Life sciences and geosciences dominate, Cumulative totals by field, 2008–2014.svg|thumb|Scientific research output in terms of publications in Southern Africa, cumulative totals by field, 2008–2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 |date=2015|chapter= Figure 20.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Malawi's first science and technology policy dates from 1991 and was revised in 2002. The ''National Science and Technology Policy'' of 2002 envisaged the establishment of a National Commission for Science and Technology to advise the government and other stakeholders on science and technology-led development. Although the Science and Technology Act of 2003 made provision for the creation of this commission, it only became operational in 2011, with a secretariat resulting from the merger of the Department of Science and Technology and the National Research Council. The Science and Technology Act of 2003 also established a Science and Technology Fund to finance research and studies through government grants and loans but, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, this was not yet operational. The Secretariat of the National Commission for Science and Technology has reviewed the ''Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation'' (2011–2015) but, as of early 2015, the revised policy had not yet met with Cabinet approval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Malawi is conscious of the need to attract more foreign investment to foster technology transfer, develop human capital and empower the private sector to drive economic growth. In 2012, most foreign investment flowed to infrastructure (62%) and the energy sector (33%). The government has introduced a series of fiscal incentives, including tax breaks, to attract more foreign investors. In 2013, the Malawi Investment and Trade Centre put together an investment portfolio spanning 20 companies in the country's six major economic growth sectors, namely:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* agriculture;
* manufacturing;
* energy (bio-energy, mobile electricity);
* tourism (ecolodges);
* infrastructure (wastewater services, fibre optic cables, etc.); and
* mining.

In 2013, the government adopted a ''National Export Strategy'' to diversify the country's exports. Production facilities are to be established for a wide range of products within the three selected clusters: oil seed products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. The government estimates that these three clusters have the potential to represent more than 50% of Malawi's exports by 2027. In order to help companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the strategy makes provision for greater access to the outcome of international research and better information about available technologies; it also helps companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from sources such as the country's Export Development Fund and the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund is a competitive facility, through which businesses in Malawi's agricultural and manufacturing sectors can apply for grant funding for innovative projects with potential for making a strong social impact and helping the country to diversify its narrow range of exports. The first round of competitive bidding opened in April 2014.The fund is aligned on the three clusters selected within the country's ''National Export Strategy'': oil seed products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. It provides a matching grant of up to 50% to innovative business projects to help absorb some of the commercial risk in triggering innovation. This support should speed up the implementation of new business models and/or the adoption of

technologies. The fund is endowed with US$8 million from the United Nations Development Programme and the UK Department for International Development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Achievements ===
Among the notable achievements stemming from the implementation of national policies for science, technology and innovation in recent years are the:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Establishment, in 2012, of the Malawi University of Science and Technology and the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) to build STI capacity. LUANAR was delinked from the University of Malawi. This brings the number of public universities to four, with the University of Malawi and Mzuzu University;
* Improvement in biomedical research capacity through the five-year Health Research Capacity Strengthening Initiative (2008–2013) awarding research grants and competitive scholarships at PhD, master's and first degree levels, supported by the UK Wellcome Trust and DfID;
* Strides made in conducting cotton confined field trials, with support from the US Program for Biosafety Systems, Monsanto and LUANAR.
* Introduction of ethanol fuel as an alternative fuel to petrol and the adoption of ethanol technology;
* Launch of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Policy for Malawi in December 2013, to drive the deployment of ICTs in all economic and productive sectors and improve ICT infrastructure in rural areas, especially via the establishment of telecentres; and
* A review of secondary school curricula in 2013.

===Education===

{{Main|Education in Malawi}}
In Malawi, primary education is compulsory (Revised Education Act 2012). In 1994, free primary education for all children was established by the government, which increased attendance rates. Dropout rates are higher for girls than boys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/Malawi.htm|title=Malawi|accessdate=6 October 2008|publisher=Bureau of International Labor Affairs, US Dept. of Labor|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006092319/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/TDA2001/malawi.htm|archivedate=6 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to security problems during the long travel to school, as girls face a higher prevalence of gender-based violence. However, attendance rates for all children are improving, with enrollment rates for primary schools increased from 58% in 1992 to 75% in 2007, while the number of students who begin in standard one and complete standard five has increased from 64% in 1992 to 86% in 2006. However attendance in secondary school falls to approximately 25%, with attendance rates being slightly higher for males.&lt;ref name=Furlong&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=USA|isbn=978-0-415-56479-3|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=U.N.&gt;{{cite web|title=The world youth report: youth and climate change|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unyin/documents/WYR2010Final%20online%20version.pdf|website=United Nations|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Youth literacy has also increased, moving from 68% in 2000 to 82% in 2007. This increase is primarily attributed to improved learning materials in schools, better infrastructure and feeding programs that have been implemented throughout the school system.&lt;ref name=UNDP/&gt;

Education in Malawi comprises eight years of primary education, four years of secondary school and four years of university.

There are four public universities in Malawi, namely; [[Mzuzu University]] (MZUNI), Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR), [[University of Malawi]] (UNIMA) and [[Malawi University of Science and Technology]](MUST). Besides these, there are also private universities like; Livingstonia, Malawi Lakeview, Catholic University of Malawi, African Bible College, UNICAF University, MIM etc. The entry requirement is six credits on the Malawi school Certificate of Education certificate which is equivalent to O levels.

In 2016, the Malawi eHealth Research Centre in partnership with Mzuzu University and Luke International was established and is Malawi's first fully dedicated eHealth Research Centre. This new research facility will contribute to improve health and social outcomes for communities in Malawi, by enhancing the quality of research and education in eHealth and healthcare.

==Military==
{{Main|Malawian Defence Force}}

Malawi maintains a small standing military of approximately 25,000 men, the [[Malawian Defence Force]]. It consists of army, navy and air force elements. The Malawi army originated from [[British Army|British colonial units]] formed before independence, and is now made up of two rifle regiments and one parachute regiment. The Malawi Air Force was established with German help in 1976, and operates a small number of transport aircraft and multi-purpose helicopters. The Malawian Navy has 3 vessels operating on Lake Malawi, based in [[Monkey Bay]].&lt;ref name="Turner22"&gt;Turner, ''The Statesman's Yearbook'', p. 822&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Malawi n3.jpg|thumb|upright|A Malawian man playing a [[xylophone]]]]

{{See also|Music of Malawi|Malawian cuisine}}

The name "Malawi" comes from the [[Maravi]], a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people who emigrated from the southern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] around 1400&amp;nbsp;AD. Upon reaching northern Lake Malawi, the group divided, with one group moving south down the west bank of the lake to become the group known as the [[Chewa people|Chewa]], while the other group, the ancestors of today's Nyanja, moved along the east side of the lake to the southern section of Malawi. Ethnic conflict and continuing migration prevented the formation of a society that was uniquely and cohesively Malawian until the dawn of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century. Over the past century, ethnic distinctions have diminished to the point where there is no significant inter-ethnic friction, although regional divisions still occur. The concept of a Malawian nationality has begun to form around a predominantly rural people who are generally conservative and traditionally nonviolent. The "Warm Heart of Africa" nickname is not due to the hot weather of the country, but due to the kind, loving nature of the Malawian people.&lt;ref name="StateDept" /&gt;

From 1964–2010, and again since 2012, the [[Flag of Malawi]] is made up of three equal horizontal stripes of black, red and green with a red rising sun superimposed in the center of the black stripe. The black stripe represented the African people, the red represented the blood of martyrs for African freedom, green represented Malawi's ever-green nature and the rising sun represented the dawn of freedom and hope for Africa.&lt;ref name="Flag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.us/flags/mw.html|title=Malawi|work=Flags of the World Website|author=Berry, Bruce|date=6 February 2005|accessdate=22 September 2010|publisher=Flags of the World|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821101750/http://www.fotw.us/flags/mw.html|archivedate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the flag was changed, removing the red rising sun and adding a full white sun in the center as a symbol of Malawi's [[economy of Malawi|economic progress]]. The change was reverted in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nyasatimes.com/2012/05/30/dpp-govt-blew-k3bn-on-flag-change/|title=DPP govt blew K3bn on flag change|newspaper=Nyasa Times|accessdate=10 April 2013|date=30 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518233702/http://www.nyasatimes.com/2012/05/30/dpp-govt-blew-k3bn-on-flag-change/|archivedate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its dances are a strong part of Malawi's culture, and the [[National Dance Troupe]] (formerly the Kwacha Cultural Troupe) was formed in November 1987 by the government.&lt;ref name="Turner24" /&gt; Traditional music and dances can be seen at [[Initiation|initiation rites]], [[ritual]]s, marriage ceremonies and celebrations.

The indigenous ethnic groups of Malawi have a rich tradition of [[Basket weaving|basketry]] and [[mask]] [[wood carving|carving]], and some of these goods are used in traditional ceremonies still performed by native peoples. [[Wood carving]] and [[oil painting]] are also popular in more urban centres, with many of the items produced being sold to tourists. There are several internationally recognised literary figures from Malawi, including poet [[Jack Mapanje]], history and fiction writer [[Paul Tiyambe Zeleza|Paul Zeleza]] and authors [[Legson Kayira]], [[Felix Mnthali]], [[Frank Chipasula]] and [[David Rubadiri]].

===Sports===
Football is the most common sport in Malawi, introduced there during British colonial rule. Its [[Malawi national football team|national team]] has failed to qualify to [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] so far, but have made two appearances in the [[Africa Cup of Nations]]. Basketball is also growing in popularity, but its [[Malawi national basketball team|national team]] is yet to participate in any international competition.&lt;ref name=Gall&gt;{{cite book |year=1998|editor1-last=Gall|editor1-first=James L. |title=Worldmark Encyclopaedia of Cultures and Daily Life|url= |volume=Volume 1 – Africa|edition= |location=Detroit and London|publisher=Gale Research|pages=101–102 |isbn=0 7876 0552 2 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
Malawian cuisine is diverse, with tea and fish being popular features of the country's cuisine.&lt;ref name=emb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malawiembassy.org/en/visit/food.html |title=The Official Website of the Embassy of the Republic of Malawi to Japan |website=Malawiembassy.org |date= |accessdate=9 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314022501/http://www.malawiembassy.org/en/visit/food.html |archivedate=14 March 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar, coffee, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats are also important components of the cuisine and economy. [[Lake Malawi]] is a source of fish including [[Oreochromis lidole|chambo]] (similar to [[bream]]) [[usipa]] (similar to [[sardine]]), and [[mpasa]] (similar to [[salmon]] and [[kampango]]).&lt;ref name=emb/&gt; [[Nsima]] is a food staple made from ground corn and typically served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. It is commonly eaten for lunch and dinner.&lt;ref name=emb/&gt;

[[Image:Kathrein EXR5016T Multiswitch.jpg|200px|thumb|a Multiswitch with 16 outputs, the four cables from the Quattro-LNB enter on the left]]

:''This article is about the device used in satellite TV installation, for overcurrent protection devices see [[Resettable fuse]]

A '''multiswitch''' is a device used with a dual or [[Low-noise block converter#Dual.2FQuad.2FQuattro.2FOcto LNBs|quattro LNB]] to distribute [[satellite TV]] signals to multiple (usually more than four) receivers from a single [[satellite dish|dish]] and [[low-noise block converter|LNB]].

A typical [[Low-noise block converter#Universal LNB|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band universal LNB]] designed for the European market can be switched between four modes (two frequency ranges and two polarisations) selected by signals from the receiver (supply voltage for polarisation and presence or absence of a 22&amp;nbsp;kHz tone for frequency range). This means that each receiver needs a separate feed and twin-tuner receivers (such as [[Sky+]] and [[Freesat+]]) need two separate feeds. For small numbers of receivers a multi-output LNB is used and all the feeds are taken straight from the LNB but there is a limit to the number of outputs that can reasonably be placed on a LNB.

So for larger installations a [[Low-noise block converter#Dual.2Ftwin.2Fquad.2Focto LNBs|quattro LNB]] is used in conjunction with a multiswitch. The quattro LNB provides the signals for all four of the modes at the same time. The multiswitch then selects which of these signals to send to each receiver . For very large installations the signals from the LNB can be split and fed to more than one multiswitch. Typically a larger dish is used to make up for the extra losses in the longer cable runs and the multiswitches.

Some multiswitches can also mix in terrestrial TV and FM radio signals which can then be split out again by a special faceplate (known as a triplexer). Such [[Integrated reception system|Integrated Reception Systems]] allows satellite, TV and radio service to be supplied down a single cable saving on installation costs.

Multiswitches are commonly installed on or in blocks of flats to allow all the residents to receive satellite TV without having to have a separate dish for every resident.

== Variations  ==
Some multiswitches only have two inputs (for one dual LNB), in this case, depending on the voltage supplied by the receiver; either horizontal or vertical polarisation is selected.

* 3 input multiswitches are available, which combine a dual LNB with an input from a terrestrial antenna.
* 5 input multiswitches are also available, which combine the 4 input "standard" multiswitch with an input from a terrestrial antenna.
* 5x8 (5 by 8) Multiswitches, which have 4 satellite input, 1 terrestrial antenna input and 8 outputs
* 17x8 (17 by 8) Multiswitches, which have 16 satellite input, 1 terrestrial antenna input and 8 outputs within builtin amplifier for compensating cable losses

=== North America ===
North American frequency assignments differ from those used in Europe and other countries. Typically, the lower half of the Ku band contains communications satellites and free-to-air or ethnic-language programming, using linearly-polarised LNBs; the upper half of the Ku band contains circular-polarised direct broadcast satellite signals.

As North American DBS providers are notorious for forcing proprietary "package" receivers on their subscribers, often with no ability to tune outside the one pay-TV package, the wideband "quattro LNB" able to tune multiple distinct Ku band frequency ranges is uncommon. Most LNB's only have the frequency range needed to tune one DBS provider's signal.
The common LNB types are:
* Ku band (lower), linear, polarisation switched by DC line voltage. These are common for FTA reception, also some earlier StarChoice (Shaw DBS) systems.
* Ku band (lower), linear, both polarisations "stacked" by outputting one set of signals 575&amp;nbsp;MHz higher than the other. This assumes the band to be tuned is at most 500&amp;nbsp;MHz wide; these were usually distributed with StarChoice package receivers.
* Ku band (upper), circular polarisation, switched by DC line voltage. The most common North American DBS LNB, these would receive a single DBS satellite (electrically but not mechanically interchangeable between DirecTV, DishNetwork, Bell) and are often dual-output LNBs.
* Ku band (upper), circular polarisation, both polarisations "stacked" by outputting one of the two sets of signals on a higher frequency and frequency-inverted. These would receive both polarisations of a single DBS satellite at once on one cable. The DishNetwork "DishPro" LNB had these characteristics.
* Multiple LNB's in the same package, for use with a pair of satellites in known positions just a few degrees apart, received on a single fixed dish. The individual LNB's in the package may be standard (DC voltage selects polarisation) or stacked (both polarisations output at once, on different frequency). If the package contains a switch, it would either use 22&amp;nbsp;kHz to switch between two satellites (DirecTV, StarChoice) or use a proprietary switch (EchoStar/DishNetwork). Standards-compliant DiSEQC switches are rare in the North American DBS market, except in free-to-air applications.

The implications for North American DBS multiswitch selection are:
* A single unstacked (polarisation switched by DC line voltage) LNB is compatible with a two- or three-input multiswitch.
* A pair of unstacked (polarisation switched by DC line voltage) LNB's for a two-satellite package is likely compatible with a four- or five-input multiswitch if it is using 22&amp;nbsp;kHz to switch between the two satellites and if it has at least four outputs.
* A "stacked" LNB (both polarisations output at once on different frequencies) on a single satellite needs only a signal splitter, not a true multiswitch. The splitter must be able to pass DC power from one of the receivers to the LNB without interference.
* A pair of "stacked" LNB's needs a signal splitter on each (able to pass DC power) and switches between the signal splitters and each receiver.
* Any other configuration with multiple LNB's is likely to need proprietary hardware to work with more than one or two receivers.

'''Radio Ceylon''' ({{lang-si|ලංකා ගුවන් විදුලි සේවය}} ''Lanka Guwan Viduli Sevaya'', {{lang-ta|&lt;small&gt;இலங்கை வானொலி&lt;/small&gt;}}, ''ilankai vanoli'') is the oldest [[radio station]] in [[Asia]]. Broadcasting was started on an experimental basis in [[Ceylon]] by the [[Telegraph]] Department in 1923, just three years after the inauguration of broadcasting in [[Europe]].

== Beginning ==

The history of Radio Ceylon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Papers of Adrian Jose (1908-1991)|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/ms/findaids/7702.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of broadcasting"&gt;[[History of broadcasting]]&lt;/ref&gt; dates back to year 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Ceylon ruled the airwaves|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/when-ceylon-ruled-the-airwaves/article3219259.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; when its first precursor, ''Colombo Radio'', was launched on 16 December 1925 using a Medium Wave radio transmitter of one kilowatt of output power from Welikada, Colombo. Commenced just 3 years after the launch of BBC, Colombo radio was the first ever radio station in Asia and the second oldest radio station in the world. Home of Ceylon Gramophones.&lt;ref name="History of broadcasting"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gramophones Of Ceylon|url=http://www.dinuracreations.lk/p/sinhala-old-hits.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Dodd]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mixed Signals Radio Broadcasting Policy in India (page: 2176)|url=http://www.communityradioindia.org/cr%20resources/Kanchan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new medium of mass communication not only became increasingly popular in the years that followed, but also quickly evolved into a medium of national character, which led to the “Radio Service” being organized as a separate department of the government of Ceylon (as the country now [[Sri Lanka]] was then called) by the ‘call sign’ ‘Radio Ceylon’ in 1949. Subsequently, in 1967, the Department of Broadcasting was transformed into its present statutory form of a state corporation by the Ceylon broadcasting corporation Act. No 37 of 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka Consolidated Acts|url=http://www.commonlii.org/lk/legis/num_act/slbca48o1988458/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Radio in Sri Lanka]]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[parliament of Ceylon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliament Of Sri Lanka}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby assuring increased autonomy and flexibility in the operations of the new organization.
The organization acquired its present name, [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]], with the transition of the state into the status of ''Republic of [[Sri Lanka]]'' on 22 May 1972. SLBC ( Stand for Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation) has since continued in the same legal status as a state corporation, and is currently listed under the scope of the ministry of Information and Media of the Government of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Ministry of Mass Media and Information|url=http://www.media.gov.lk/english/index.php?lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of ministries of Sri Lanka]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition of Domestic Broadcasting from [[Medium wave]] to [[FM broadcasting]]==

As was the case with many national radio stations with the same standing several decades ago, SLBC was relying on medium wave as the primary mode of domestic broadcasting until the dawn of ‘90s. Some sporadic FM broadcasts had nevertheless been already introduced at several transmitting stations more as a means of ‘relaying’ the broadcasts to medium wave transmitting stations. However, by late ‘80s SLBC was acting in recognition of the strategic importance of switching from MW to FM as the primary mode of domestic broadcasting. Accordingly, in 1993, ‘the FM Stereo Broadcasting Facility at Colombo’ was commissioned with the technical assistance of the government of Japan.&lt;br/&gt;
This was followed by the ‘Island FM Development Project’ that was launched in year 1995. The objectives of the project were to develop an Islandwide multi-channel FM stereo broadcast transmission network and to divest the costly domestic medium wave transmitting stations, which were typically broadcasting only one or two programme channels per transmitting station. By 1999, more than 95% country’s total population was being covered by SLBC’s FM transmissions with nearly 90% of them receiving all six nationwide channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka Media Stats|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/profiles/Sri-Lanka/Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme Channels (Radio Services) currently maintained by SLBC==
SLBC has, throughout its history, been committed to its mandated task of maintaining the public service broadcasting in Sri Lanka, by way of providing the public with the information and entertainment, and fostering the social, cultural and economic development of the country, and has maintained this commitment as the core guiding principle of its programming policy. Despite the introduction of a certain amount of commercial programming into its operations, in order to partially finance its predominantly public service broadcasting operations, the respective station genres and the programming content are carefully designed to be within its programming policy guidelines.
At present, SLBC’s Islandwide (domestic) FM network broadcasts six regular programme channels on a nationwide basis, and those six ‘national’ channels account for the major proportion of its domestic broadcasting. The six channels are,

1. Sinhala Swadeshiya Sevaya’ (Sinhala National Service)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SLBC - Sinhala National Service (Swadeshiya Sevaya) Online Live Radio|url=http://www.lankawebnet.info/radio/sinhala/slbc-sinhala-national-service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
2. Tamil National Service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SLBC Tamil National Service|url=http://www.slbc.lk/index.php/programme-lineup/tamil-national-service.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329023344/http://www.slbc.lk/index.php/programme-lineup/tamil-national-service.html|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
3. English Service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Service|url=http://www.slbc.lk/index.php/programme-lineup/english-service.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915105538/http://www.slbc.lk/index.php/programme-lineup/english-service.html|archivedate=15 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
4. City FM (Sinhala)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= City FM|url= http://www.slbc.lk/index.php/services/city-fm|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141220121916/http://www.slbc.lk/index.php/services/city-fm|archivedate= 20 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
5. Velenda Sevaya’ (Sinhala Commercial Service), and &lt;br/&gt;
6. Thendral (Tamil Commercial Service)

While the first 03 channels are dedicated for public service broadcasting in the three languages Sinhala, Tamil and English, the fourth one (City FM) is maintained as a channel dedicated for the youth. The last two channels, whilst representing ‘an adult contemporary’ genre, accommodates a certain amount of commercial content. Besides the above six channels operated on a regular basis, SLBC also operates on nationwide basis a seventh channel, namely the ‘Sports Service’, which is a channel dedicated for sports, but only during the times of major sports events such as international cricket matches.
The other component of domestic broadcasting comprises 04 Regional Services, each of which are originating from respective regional studio centres, and 05 community radio services, operated in five specific areas with substantial socio economic homogeneity. All of these regional and community radio services maintained by the SLBC largely represent a public service broadcasting format with regional community focus.
In addition to the above domestic services, SLBC is also operating a host of overseas services, transmitting in short-wave to the South &amp; South-West Asia and the Middle East, in Sinhala, English, Hindi and several Indian sub-continental languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian subcontinent]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is a medium wave transmitting facility for broadcasting mainly to the Southern regions of India.

== Contribution Of Edward Harper ==

[[Edward Harper (engineer)|Edward Harper]], who came to Ceylon as Chief Engineer of the Telegraph Office in 1921, was the first person to actively promote broadcasting in Ceylon.

In the first-ever radio experiments in [[Colombo, Sri Lanka|Colombo]], [[phonograph|gramophone]] [[music]] was broadcast from a tiny room in the Central Telegraph Office with the aid of a small transmitter built by the Telegraph Department engineers from the radio equipment of a captured [[Germany|German]] [[submarine]].&lt;ref name="Transmitter"&gt;{{cite web|title=For that Old Magic (Frontline Magazine, India)|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127001908700.htm|accessdate=2008-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918024249/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127001908700.htm|archivedate=18 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment was a success and three years later, on 16 December 1925, a regular broadcasting service came to be instituted in Ceylon. The station was called "Colombo Radio," with the call sign "Colombo Calling."

Harper also founded the Ceylon Wireless Club together with [[United Kingdom|British]] and Ceylon's radio enthusiasts in the city of Colombo. Ceylonese engineers joined the Ceylon Wireless Club and carried out radio experiments with Edward Harper. These were exciting times for radio in South Asia. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Many {{who|date=October 2014}} regard Edward Harper as the "Father of Broadcasting in Ceylon."

During [[World War II]], the radio station operations were taken over by the allied forces who operated Radio SEAC from Colombo.&lt;ref name="Radio SEAC"&gt;{{cite web |title= Radio SEAC Ceylon (Radio Heritage Foundation)|url=http://www.radioheritage.net/FDD.asp|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The station was handed over to the Government of Ceylon after the war. Radio Ceylon came into being after the war and climbed broadcasting heights in South Asia, leading the way in the world of entertainment and news. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The very first senior management officers of the station came from the BBC; John Lampson was appointed Director General of broadcasting, and Pascoe Thornton was appointed Director of Programmes of the National Service at the station.&lt;ref name="John Lampson"&gt;{{cite web |title= Gnanam Rathinam - a pioneer Radio Ceylon broadcaster|url=http://www.tamilweek.com/Gnanam_Rathinam_0010.html|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil servant [[M.J Perera]] was the first Ceylonese Director-General of Radio Ceylon and another civil servant, [[Vernon Abeysekera]], was appointed Director of Programmes.

Other Sri Lankan personalities such as [[Owen de Abrew]], the most senior [[Ballroom Dance]] professional on the island&lt;ref name="Owen de Abrew"&gt;{{cite web |title=Owen de Abrew:Dance teacher par excellence (Sunday Times, Sri Lanka)|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/060514/tv/dance.html|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and top film director [[Lester James Peiris]]&lt;ref name="Lester James Peiris"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lester James Peries, a figure of the nation’s destiny (Sunday Island, Sri Lanka)|url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/features/20020122lester_james.htm|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ( who reviewed books for ' Radio Bookshelf ' ) were involved in radio programmes on the airwaves.

This was in the heyday of Radio Ceylon, the announcers and presenters, particularly those who presented radio programmes on the All Asia beam, enjoyed iconic status. Radio Ceylon ruled the airwaves in South Asia as millions in the Indian sub-continent tuned into the radio station.&lt;ref name="Radio Ceylon"&gt;{{cite web |title=When Ceylon ruled the airwaves|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2006/01/01/stories/2006010100150400.htm |accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; People picked up Radio Ceylon broadcasts as far away as the United States of America.&lt;ref name="United States of America"&gt;{{cite web |title=QSL card from Radio Ceylon for report on 30 April 1954 (The Classic Shortwave Broadcast QSL Page)|url=http://k6eid.tripod.com/ceylon.htm|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Hindu]] newspaper placed Ameen Sayani and Vernon Corea&lt;ref name="Vernon Corea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vernon Corea's Death Anniversary (Daily News, Colombo)|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2004/09/28/new42.html|accessdate=2008-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604145934/http://www.dailynews.lk/2004/09/28/new42.html|archivedate=4 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of Radio Ceylon in the top five great broadcasters of the world.&lt;ref name="Top 5 Broadcasters"&gt;{{cite web |title=Those Golden Voices (Hindu Newspaper, India)|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2004/07/01/stories/2004070101440100.htm|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Ceylon turned young Ceylon's talent into household names - among them the Ceylon's musicians of the 1950s and 1960s - [[Nimal Mendis]],&lt;ref name="Nimal Mendis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nimal Mendis composes tsunami song (Daily News, Sri Lanka)|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2005/01/18/new32.html|accessdate=2008-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119195824/http://www.dailynews.lk/2005/01/18/new32.html|archivedate=19 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Forbes,&lt;ref name="Bill Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |title= Stories from Ole Ceylon: Bill Forbes|url=http://oleceylon.blogspot.com/2007/06/bill-forbes.html|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cliff Foenander]], [[Des Kelly]], Adrian Ferdinands, Tissa Seneviratne, Harold Seneviratne, [[Douglas Meerwald]] and the Manhattans,&lt;ref name="Douglas Meerwald"&gt;{{cite web |title= The Big Band Musician |url=http://douglasmeerwald.tripod.com/id9.html|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few presented by Ameen Sayani&lt;ref name="Binaca Geet Mala"&gt;{{cite news |title=A legendary affair with the airwaves (Hindu Magazine,India)|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2006/08/13/stories/2006081300070500.htm|accessdate=2008-09-04 | location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu|date=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Overseas Service among them.

There was also a religious and cultural dimension to radio programming and Radio Ceylon broadcast [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]], [[Muslim]] and [[Christian]] programmes. The station had ' three broadcasting arms ' - the ''Commercial Service'', the ''National Service'' and the ''All Asia Service''. Radio programmes were broadcast in [[English language|English]], [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]  and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] - the ''All Asia'' beam had many programmes broadcast in [[Hindi]]. Pandit [[W. D. Amaradeva]] and other distinguished Sri Lankan musicians have all given concert recitals in the studios of the station.

== The Hindi Service ==

Radio Ceylon had a very lucrative arm - the Hindi Service of the station launched in the early 1950s. Millions of rupees in terms of advertising revenue came from India. The station employed some of the most popular Indian announcers who played a vital role in establishing Radio Ceylon as the 'King of the Airwaves' in South Asia, among them, the Ganjwar sisters, Vimla and Kamini, [[Vijay Kishore Dubey]], Gopal Sharma,  Hasan Razvi , [[Vijaylaxmi]] Ripusudan Kumar Ailawadi, popularly known as Kumar and [[Manohar Mahajan]], [[Sunil Dutt]] (who went on to become a film star in [[Bollywood]]), [[Ameen Sayani]] and elder brother [[Hamid Sayani]] though not hired by Radio Ceylon became popular by using Radio Ceylon for broadcasting programs like "[[Binaca Geetmala]]" (first broadcast in 1952) and "Lipton Ke Sitaare."

[[File:Legendary Announcers of Radio Ceylon, 1953.jpg|thumb|Group picture of Announcers of Radio Ceylon in the year 1953]]
What captured the Indian listener were the film songs, the golden age of Hindi film music was in the 1950s and 1960s - Radio Ceylon was at the right place at the right time to reach out to the target market of millions of listeners - the station popularised the movie songs, including the talents of playback singers [[Asha Bhosle]],&lt;ref name="Asha Bhosle"&gt;{{cite news |title=

Saigal]], [[Kishore Kumar]], [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[S. Janaki]] and others. This was a brilliant move by Radio Ceylon as [[Bollywood]] film music was banned by All India Radio and other Indian radio stations at the time.&lt;ref name="Bollywood film music banned"&gt;{{cite web|title=That mesmeric voice (Metro Plus, Chennai-The Hindu, India)|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2007/01/20/stories/2007012001280100.htm|accessdate=2008-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322211554/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2007/01/20/stories/2007012001280100.htm|archivedate=22 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to increased listenership for radio programmes such as ''Binaca Geetmala''. Radio Ceylon had a captive audience. The ''Binaca Hit Parade'' was presented by 'happy go lucky' [[Greg Roskowski]], it was a countdown of English pop music beamed on the Commercial Service and the All Asia Service. Having heard the programme, Indian listeners flooded the station with letters requesting a count down of Hindi filmi songs and the idea of ''Binaca Geetmala'' was born.&lt;ref name="Bina Hit Parade"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reference to Greg Roskowski and the Binaca Hit Parade on Radio Ceylon on 'Who moved my Aiwaves?'

Radio Ceylon also popularised the English songs of Indian popular musicians - they went on to score huge hits, among them Uma Pocha( ''Bombay Meri Hai'' ), [[Usha Uthup]] who has the rare distinction of singing Sri Lankan [[baila]] songs with ease and the Anglo-Indian star, Ernest Ignatius ( who went on to be a success in [[Andrew Lloyd Webber|Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s '[[Bombay Dreams]]' in London ) had a massive hit, ''I Married a Female Wrestler'', on Radio Ceylon.&lt;ref name="Ernest Ignatius"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reference to Ernest Ignatius and his hit 'I married a female wrestler' |url=http://www.reallyuseful.com/rug/shows/bombaydreams/cast/ErnestIgnatius.htm |accessdate=2008-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806185559/http://www.reallyuseful.com/rug/shows/bombaydreams/cast/ErnestIgnatius.htm |archivedate=6 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station was an advertiser's dream - thousands of jingles were recorded and beamed on the All Asia Service - from Lux soap to [[Coca-Cola]]. Major brands queued up for their jingles to be broadcast live by the announcers over the airwaves of Radio Ceylon, such was the station's advertising power.&lt;ref name="Jingles"&gt;{{cite web |title=It's All in the Name(The Hindu, India) |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/mag/2002/09/08/stories/2002090800070400.htm|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masterminding the revenue from India was Radio Ceylon's advertising agent, Hari Haran, from Radio Advertising Services.

== Clifford R. Dodd ==
[[Image:Cliffordrdodd.jpg#file|thumb|left|[[Clifford Dodd|Clifford R. Dodd]], Director of the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon, who came to the island under the [[Colombo Plan]] pictured here in 1958.]]

Australian [[Clifford Dodd]] was sent to Radio Ceylon under the Colombo Plan. Dodd turned the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon into a huge success. Dodd was a charismatic figure and he used his powers of persuasion to rise above politics to make Radio Ceylon into a successful brand name in South Asia. The radio station had no real competition in the region. Clifford Dodd and Livy Wijemanne hand picked some of the brightest talents in Sri Lanka, turning them into popular professional broadcasters.

Clifford R. Dodd's leadership, enthusiasm and drive helped motivate the young Ceylonese broadcasters - they were the brightest and the best in terms of creative talent. Dodd helped shape the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon. The station spiralled upwards in terms of popularity and revenue for the country.

== Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation ==
[[Image:Rural radio ceylon.jpg|thumb|Director General [[Neville Jayaweera]] in the boardroom of Radio Ceylon.]]

Radio Ceylon became a public corporation on 30 September 1967 and the station's name was changed to the Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation. Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake appointed a distinguished Ceylonese civil servant, [[Neville Jayaweera]] to head the CBC.

When Sri Lanka became a republic in 1972 the station underwent yet another name change as the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC).

In December 2005 Sri Lanka celebrated eighty years in broadcasting, a historic landmark in the world of broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Eighty Years"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eighty Years in Broadcasting in Sri Lanka (Daily News, Colombo)|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2005/12/27/fea02.htm|accessdate=2008-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925204950/http://www.dailynews.lk/2005/12/27/fea02.htm|archivedate=25 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 2007 the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation celebrated forty years as a public broadcasting corporation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4647">A '''Satellite contribution''' link or service is a means to transport video programming by a satellite link from a remote source (such as an [[outside broadcast]] unit) to a broadcaster's studio or from the studio to a [[satellite|satellite TV]] [[uplink]] centre (for onward distribution by [[direct-to-home|DTH]], [[cable TV|cable]] etc.).

[[Image:Sat contribution fig.jpg|thumb|right|500 px|Signal path for a Satellite Contribution link from a broadcaster's studio to DTH viewers]]
Such contribution links are often made by terrestrial connections ([[landline]], [[Fiber-optic communication|fibre]], etc.) but the use of a satellite "[[Hop (telecommunications)|hop]]" provides advantages in some situations. 

Satellite operators and third party agencies provide satellite contribution links for the occasional or regular use of the client broadcasters.

==Advantages==
In remote locations, using terrestrial links such as fibre is prohibitively expensive whereas satellite can cheaply and easily overcome the "[[last mile|first-mile]]" connectivity gaps in rural and other remote areas. A comparable fibre service would have to use extremely diverse routing to achieve the same availability.

A single satellite link can span a huge distance that would take a terrestrial link through many countries and commercial operators. The satellite operator provides a single point of accountability whereas establishing a link and resolving service interruptions with fibre can prove difficult, especially across national borders and with multiple carriers. 

Duplication of active components in the transmission and reception sites, and in-orbit backup satellite capacity provides a fully redundant contribution connection.

Monitoring of the signal allows for fast and effective changes before problems affect the service. E.g. uplink power may be automatically increased during adverse weather conditions.

[[SES S.A.|SES]] provides an example service that provides permanent delivery of live and recorded TV and radio signals to the company's [[Luxembourg]] uplink facility (used for 15 satellites, serving over 120 million viewers&lt;ref&gt;''ASTRA Infobooklet'' SES ASTRA. March 2009. Company facts compedium&lt;/ref&gt;) from almost any location across Europe.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;SES ASTRA ''Ka-band Contribution Service'' (August 2008). Company factsheet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Whereas satellite contribution links may be provided using transmission in {{Ku band}} (or even [[C band (IEEE)|C band]]) frequencies, it is increasingly common to use the higher frequency [[Ka-band]] uplink and downlink for the contribution feed, as that band is relatively unused.

Ka-band provides for a smaller contribution uplink dish size (typically 1.8m compared to a minimum of 2.4m using Ku-band) and it can also be used as a backup for the DTH uplink itself or when a full DTH uplink antenna (typically 9m) cannot be accommodated at the client's studio.

Signals at the studio [[playout]] centre or outside broadcast unit are typically [[MPEG-4]] compressed and transmitted in [[DVB-S2]]&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt; for turnaround uplink to the DTH satellites, without additional processing, although [[IPTV|IP-over-satellite]] transmission may also be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/optibase-essa-satellite-canal33-news/ |title= Optibase, ESSA deliver IP-over-satellite contribution solution for Canal33 news (August 17, 2007) |publisher=Broadcast Engineering |accessdate=June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advanced applications==
Whereas a contribution link from a studio to a DTH uplink centre is usually provided within a single satellite [[Footprint (satellite)|footprint]], the [[Astra 4A]]/[[Sirius (satellite)|Sirius 4]] satellite provides for an innovative intercontinental contribution link service using a single Ka-band transponder with a European footprint and a Ku-band transponder serving southern Africa. Contribution feeds can be transferred from one region to the other, and in one frequency band to the other, in a single satellite hop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astra-aps.com/resources/pdf/en-shared/satellite_factsheets/0_SIRIUS4.pdf ''SIRIUS 4''].

The '''Toronto Global Forum''' (TGF) is an annual economic event organized by the [[International Economic Forum of the Americas]] since 2007.

==Mission==
The Toronto Global Forum is a [[not-for-profit organization]] presenting annual conferences on global economic issues. The TGF mission is to promote open debate and dialogues on national and international issues. Each year, the event welcomes heads of state, Fortune 500 CEOs, international organizations, central bank governors, civil society, etc. to foster free discussion between world leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona Teachers Inspire A Love Of Learning|url=http://yumanewsnow.com/index.php/news/latest/1236-governor-brewer-to-address-business-ceos-at-toronto-global-forum|website=yumanewsnow.com|accessdate=19 March 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forum brings together more than 2,800 people from across the globe every year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hilltimes.com/politics-this-morning/2015/07/08/politics-this-morning-toronto-global-forum-getsundeway/42757{{Deadlink|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forum also provide a platform to facilitate meetings between key world leaders in order to encourage global discourse.

The International Economic Forum of the Americas hosts two other annual events: the [[Conference of Montreal]] (founded in 1995), as well as the [[World Strategic Forum]], held in Miami (founded in 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Ostrowski, Jeff.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="722">A '''variable import levy''' is a [[Tax|levy]] on imports that raises their price to a level at least as high as the domestic price. Such levies are adjusted frequently (hence variable) in response to changes in world market prices, and are imposed to defend administered prices set above world market prices. Under the [[Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture]], the variable levies of the EU have been converted into fixed tariffs or tariff-rate quotas.
