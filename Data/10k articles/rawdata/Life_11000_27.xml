[[Malay titles|Tan Sri]] '''Abdul Samad bin Ismail''' (18 April 1924{{spaced ndash}}4 September 2008), who often went by the moniker '''Pak Samad''', was a Malaysian journalist, writer and editor.

== Early life ==
Samad was born on 18 April 1924, in Singapore to [[Javanese people|Javanese immigrant]] parents,&lt;ref name="Magsaysay"/&gt; where he also attended [[Victoria School]].&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Pak Samad dies at 84 |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/5/nation/22246821&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905095718/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F9%2F5%2Fnation%2F22246821&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 September 2008 |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |publisher= |date=5 September 2008 |accessdate=13 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed a [[Senior Cambridge]] [[General Certificate of Education|certificate]] as a cub reporter at the daily newspaper, ''[[Utusan Melayu]]'', where he began his career in journalism in 1940.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Samad's family is "very conscious" of their Javanese heritage, and Samad himself spoke English with thick Javanese accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
During the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya]] during [[World War II]], Samad worked for the Japanese-supported newspaper, ''[[Berita Malai]]''.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; He became editor of ''Berita Malai'' when he was just 21 years old.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; The British, who controlled Malaysia during the [[colonial era]], returned following the Japanese defeat and briefly imprisoned Samad.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; He was released after a short time and returned to work at the ''[[Utusan Melayu]]''.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Samad wrote extensively in support of Malaysian independence from the United Kingdom. He often met with the Malay supporters of independence, as well as the separatists who were against Dutch rule in nearby [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=star/&gt; For his actions, Samad was arrested by the British authorities again in 1951.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; He was released from prison in 1953 and again returned to work at ''Utusan Melayu''.

Samad founded the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) with [[Lee Kuan Yew]], the future [[Prime Minister of Singapore]].&lt;ref name=star/&gt; However, disagreements between Samad and both Lee and the ''Utusan Melayu'' resulted in his move to the city of [[Kuala Lumpur]]. While in Kuala Lumpur, Samad became the head of the ''[[Berita Harian]]'' newspaper and the managing editor of the [[New Straits Times Press]] (NSTP) group.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Samad promoted several social causes within his writing in post-independence Malaysia. He drew attention to social inequalities within Malaysian society, called for the national [[standardisation]] of the [[Malay language]] and reported on the sometimes complex relationship between race and [[Malaysian politics]].&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

For his writings on social issues, which were popular with the public, Samad was arrested in 1976 under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]].&lt;ref name=star/&gt; He was finally released from prison five years later in 1981.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;&lt;ref name="Justin 1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=vhBMmG9yXgYC&amp;pg=PA14 |pages=14– |title=Historical Dictionary of Singapore |first=Justin |last=Corfield |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780810873872 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samad rejoined the New Straits Times Press group following his release from prison as an editorial adviser. He retired from full-time journalism in 1988.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

== Awards ==
He was honoured for his contribution in 1992 by the [[King of Malaysia]], who at the time was [[Sultan Azlan Shah of Perak]].&lt;ref name=star/&gt; Samad also separately received the [[Pejuang Sastera]] (Literature Champion) for literature and journalism.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

He was also awarded the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for [[List of Magsaysay awardees|Journalism, Literature and Creative Communications Arts]] in 1994 for his efforts in support of Malaysian independence, democratic [[nation building]] and Malay cultural revival in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="Magsaysay"&gt;[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographySamadIsmailAbd.htm 1994 Ramon Magsaysay Awardee for Journalism, Literature, and the Creative Communication Arts – Abdul Samad Ismail]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

== Death ==
Samad died quietly on the evening 4 September 2008, at [[Pantai Medical Centre]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. He succumbed from a severe lung infection and kidney failure at the age of 84.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; Prior to this, he had been hospitalised in the intensive care unit since 24 August 2008, due to breathing difficulties.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

[[Lee Kuan Yew]] sent his condolences to Samad's son, describing him as able and shrewd though with an innate ability to accept changed realities. In the condolence letter, Lee said that they were friends even though they had parted company politically. When Samad wanted to visit his family in Singapore, Lee had recommended that the entry ban on Samad be lifted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channelnewsasia.com/palmnews/singaporelocalnews/view/374318/1/.html{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samad was survived by his children (whom he had with his first wife, Hamidah Hassan), as well as his grandchildren &amp; great grandchildren. He had ten children during his life, eight of whom are still living.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; He had two sons, Hamed and Kamal, and daughters Maria, Norlin, Nuraina, Norazah, Nurazlin and Nurazrina.  Maria and Nuraina (http://nursamad.blogspot.com) are former journalists and are active [[bloggers]].

&lt;ref name=star/&gt; Samad's first wife, Hamidah Hassan, had died in 1990.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

He was buried at the [[Bukit Kiara Muslim Cemetery|Muslim cemetery]] in [[Bukit Kiara]], where Hamidah was also buried.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

'''Advanced glycation end products''' ('''AGEs''') are proteins or lipids that become [[Glycation|glycated]] as a result of exposure to sugars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Heart Association|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/114/6/597.full|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be a factor in aging and in the development or worsening of many [[degenerative diseases]], such as [[diabetes]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[chronic kidney disease]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vistoli|first=G|author2=De Maddis, D|author3= Cipak, A|author4= Zarkovic, N|author5= Carini, M|author6= Aldini, G|title=Advanced glycoxidation and lipoxidation end products (AGEs and ALEs): an overview of their mechanisms of formation.|journal=Free Radic Res.|date=Aug 2013|volume=47|pages=Suppl 1:3–27.|pmid=23767955|doi=10.3109/10715762.2013.815348}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary sources==
Animal-derived foods that are high in fat and protein are generally AGE-rich and are prone to further AGE formation during cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Uribarri et al|first1=Jaime|date=|year=2010|title=Advanced Glycation End Products in Foods and a Practical Guide to Their Reduction in the Diet|url=|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|volume=110|issue=6|pages=911–916|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2010.03.018|pmc=3704564|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
AGEs affect nearly every type of cell and molecule in the body and are thought to be one factor in aging and some age-related chronic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Glenn | first1 = J.| last2 = Stitt | first2 = A.| title = The role of advanced glycation end products in retinal ageing and disease| journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta| volume = 1790| issue = 10| pages = 1109–1116| year = 2009| pmid = 19409449| doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.04.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF03325227| pmid = 19448391| year = 2009| last1 = Semba | first1 = R.

Under certain pathologic conditions, such as [[oxidative stress]] due to [[hyperglycemia]] in patients with [[diabetes]],&lt;ref name=BROWNLEE2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brownlee|first=M|title=The pathobiology of diabetic complications: a unifying mechanism.|journal=Diabetes|date=June 2005|volume=54|issue=6|pages=1615–25|pmid=15919781|doi=10.2337/diabetes.54.6.1615}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hyperlipidemia]],{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} AGE formation can be increased beyond normal levels. AGEs are now known to play a role as proinflammatory mediators in [[gestational diabetes]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pertyńska-Marczewska|first=M|author2=Głowacka, E|author3= Sobczak, M|author4= Cypryk, K|author5= Wilczyński, J|title=Glycation endproducts, soluble receptor for advanced glycation endproducts and cytokines in diabetic and non-diabetic pregnancies.|journal=American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)|date=February 2009|volume=61|issue=2|pages=175–82|pmid=19143681|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0897.2008.00679.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animal and human evidence is that significant amounts of dietary advanced glycation end-products (dAGEs) are absorbed, and that dAGEs contribute to the body's burden of AGE, and are associated with diseases such as atherosclerosis and kidney disease.&lt;ref name=foods&gt;{{cite journal|last=Uribarri|first=J|author2=Woodruff, S|author3=Goodman, S|author4=Cai, W|author5=Chen, X|author6=Pyzik, R|author7=Yong, A|author8=Striker, GE|author9= Vlassara, H|title=Advanced glycation end products in foods and a practical guide to their reduction in the diet|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=June 2010|volume=110|issue=6|pages=911–16.e12|pmid=20497781|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2010.03.018|pmc=3704564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of cardiovascular disease, AGEs can induce crosslinking of collagen which can cause vascular stiffening and entrapment of low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL) in the artery walls. AGEs can also cause glycation of LDL which can promote its oxidation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Advanced glycation end products and diabetic cardiovascular disease|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Advanced+Glycation+End+Products+and+Diabetic+Cardiovascular+Disease+Anand+Prasad%252C+MD%252C*+Peter+Bekker%252C+MD%252C%25E2%2580%25A0+and+Sotirios+Tsimikas%252C+MD%25E2%2580%25A0|journal = Cardiology in Review|date = 2012-08-01|issn = 1538-4683|pmid = 22314141|pages = 177–183|volume = 20|issue = 4|doi = 10.1097/CRD.0b013e318244e57c|first = Anand|last = Prasad|first2 = Peter|last2 = Bekker|first3 = Sotirios|last3 = Tsimikas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidized LDL is one of the major factors in the development of atherosclerosis.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diabetes alters activation and repression of pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways in the vasculature|journal = Frontiers in Endocrinology|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1664-2392|pmc = 3672854|pmid = 23761786|pages = 68|volume = 4|doi = 10.3389/fendo.2013.00068|first = Elyse|last = Di Marco|first2 = Stephen P.|last2 = Gray|first3 = Karin|last3 = Jandeleit-Dahm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, AGEs can bind to [[RAGE (receptor)|RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products)]] and cause oxidative stress as well as activation of inflammatory pathways in vascular endothelial cells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===In other diseases===
The formation and accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) has been implicated in the progression of age-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tan|first=KC|author2=Chow, WS|author3=Lam, JC|author4=Lam, B|author5=Bucala, R|author6=Betteridge, J|author7= Ip, MS|title=Advanced glycation endproducts in nondiabetic patients with obstructive sleep apnea.|journal=Sleep|date=March 2006|volume=29|issue=3|pages=329–33|pmid=16553018}}&lt;/ref&gt; AGEs have been implicated in Alzheimer's Disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Srikanth|first=V|author2=Maczurek, A|author3=Phan, T|author4=Steele, M|author5=Westcott, B|author6=Juskiw, D|author7= Münch, G|title=Advanced glycation endproducts and their receptor RAGE in Alzheimer's disease.|journal=Neurobiology of Aging|date=May 2011|volume=32|issue=5|pages=763–77|pmid=19464758|doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2009.04.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  cardiovascular disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simm|first=A|author2=Wagner, J|author3=Gursinsky, T|author4=Nass, N|author5=Friedrich, I|author6=Schinzel, R|author7=Czeslik, E|author8=Silber, RE|author9= Scheubel, RJ|title=Advanced glycation endproducts: a biomarker for age as an outcome predictor after cardiac surgery?|journal=Experimental Gerontology|date=July 2007|volume=42|issue=7|pages=668–75|pmid=17482402|doi=10.1016/j.exger.2007.03.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman GA, Meistrell M 3rd, Bloom O, Cockroft KM, Bianchi M, Risucci D, Broome J, Farmer P, Cerami A, Vlassara H, et al.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 1995 Apr 25;92(9):3744-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism by which AGEs induce damage is through a process called [[cross-link]]ing that causes intracellular damage and apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;Shaikh S, Nicholson LF. Advanced glycation end products induce in vitro cross-linking of alpha-synuclein and accelerate the process of intracellular inclusion body formation.

===Pathology===
AGEs have a range of [[Pathology|pathological effects]], such as:&lt;ref name=GUGLIUCCI1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=yan/&gt;
* Increased [[vascular permeability]].
* Increased [[arterial stiffness]]
* Inhibition of [[Vasodilation|vascular dilation]] by interfering with [[nitric oxide]].
* [[Low-density lipoprotein#Importance of antioxidants|Oxidizing LDL]].
* Binding cells—including [[macrophage]], [[endothelial cell|endothelial]], and [[mesangial cell|mesangial]]—to induce the secretion of a variety of [[cytokine]]s. 
* Enhanced [[oxidative stress]].

==Clearance==
In [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]], or the rate at which a substance is removed or cleared from the body, it has been found that the cellular [[proteolysis]] of AGEs—the breakdown of proteins—produces AGE [[peptides]] and "AGE free [[adducts]]" (AGE adducts bound to single [[amino acids]]). These latter, after being released into the [[Blood plasma|plasma]], can be excreted in the [[urine]].&lt;ref name=gugliucci&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gugliucci A, Mehlhaff K, Kinugasa E |title=Paraoxonase-1 concentrations in end-stage renal disease patients increase after hemodialysis: correlation with low molecular AGE adduct clearance |journal=Clin.

Nevertheless, the resistance of [[extracellular matrix]] proteins to proteolysis renders their advanced glycation end products less conducive to being eliminated.&lt;ref name=gugliucci/&gt; While the AGE free adducts are released directly into the urine, AGE peptides are [[Endocytosis|endocytosed]] by the [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]] of the [[proximal tubule]] and then degraded by the [[lysosome|endolysosomal system]] to produce AGE amino acids. It is thought that these acids are then returned to the kidney's inside space, or [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], for [[excretion]].

Although the only form suitable for urinary excretion, the breakdown products of AGE—that is, peptides and free adducts—are more aggressive than the AGE proteins from which they are derived, and they can perpetuate related pathology in diabetic patients, even after [[hyperglycemia]] has been brought under control.&lt;ref name=GUGLIUCCI1996/&gt;

Some AGEs have an innate catalytic oxidative capacity, while activation of [[NAD(P)H oxidase]] through activation of RAGE and damage to mitochondrial proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction can also induce oxidative stress. A 2007 {{em|in vitro}} study found that AGEs could significantly increase expression of TGF-β1, CTGF, Fn mRNA in NRK-49F cells through enhancement of oxidative stress, and suggested that inhibition of oxidative stress might underlie the effect of ginkgo biloba extract in diabetic nephropathy. The authors suggested that antioxidant therapy might help prevent the accumulation of AGEs and induced damage.&lt;ref name=yan/&gt; In the end, effective clearance is necessary, and those suffering AGE increases because of kidney dysfunction might require a kidney transplant.&lt;ref name=GUGLIUCCI1996/&gt;

In diabetics who have an increased production of an AGE, kidney damage reduces the subsequent urinary removal of AGEs, forming a positive feedback loop that increases the rate of damage. In a 1997 study, diabetic and healthy subjects were given a single meal of egg white (56 g&amp;nbsp;protein), cooked with or without 100&amp;nbsp;g of fructose; there was a greater than 200-fold increase in AGE immunoreactivity from the meal with fructose.&lt;ref name=KOSCHINSKY1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koschinsky|first=T|author2=He, CJ|author3=Mitsuhashi, T|author4=Bucala, R|author5=Liu, C|author6=Buenting, C|author7=Heitmann, K|author8= Vlassara, H|title=Orally absorbed reactive glycation products (glycotoxins): an environmental risk factor in diabetic nephropathy.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Jun 10, 1997|volume=94|issue=12|pages=6474–9|pmid=9177242|pmc=21074|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.12.6474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AGEs are the subject of ongoing research. There are three therapeutic approaches: preventing the formation of AGEs, breaking crosslinks after they are formed and preventing their negative effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4353">:''This article is about Aetius, the 1st–2nd-century AD philosopher; for Aetius of Antioch, the 4th-century AD theologian, see [[Aëtius of Antioch]].''
'''Aetius''' ({{IPAc-en|eɪ|ˈ|iː|ʃ|i|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Ἀέτιος}}) was a 1st-&lt;ref&gt;Dorothea Frede, André Laks, ''Traditions of Theology'', Brill, 2002, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; or 2nd-century AD&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy, Volume I: The Earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans'', Cambridge University Press, 1962, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; [[doxographer]] and [[Eclecticism#Origin|Eclectic]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]].

==Works==
None of Aetius' works survive today, but he solves a mystery about two major compilations of philosophical quotes. There are two extant books named ''[[De Placita Philosophorum]]'' (Περὶ τῶν ἀρεσκόντων φιλοσόφοις φυσικῶν δογμάτων, "Opinions of the Philosophers") and ''[[Eclogae Physicae]]'' (Ἐκλογαὶ φυσικαὶ καὶ ἠθικαί, "Physical and Moral Extracts"). The first of these is [[Pseudo-Plutarch]] and the second is by [[Stobaeus]]. They are clearly both abridgements of a larger work. [[Hermann Diels]], in his great ''Doxographi Graeci'' (1879), discovered that the 5th-century theologician [[Theodoret]] had full versions of the quotes which were shortened in the abridgements. This means that Theodoret had managed to procure the original book which Pseudo-Plutarch and Stobeaus had shortened. He calls this book "''Aetiou tên peri areskontôn sunagôgên'' (Ἀετίου περὶ τῶν Ἀρεσκόντων Συναγωγήν&lt;!--nominative is Συναγωγή--&gt;)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10556790601056990 ''Astronomical and Astrophysical Transactions'', Vol. 25, No. 4, August 2006, 357–358].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]], [http://faculty.evansville.edu/tb2/courses/phil211/burnet/note.htm#10 ''Early Greek Philosophy'': Section B: Note on the Sources].&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore we ascribe the original ''Placita'' to Aetius.

Diels claimed that Aetius himself was merely abridging a work which Diels (1879) called ''Oldest Tenets'' or, in Latin, ''Vetusta Placita''. Unlike Aetius, whose existence is attested by Theodoret, the ''Vetusta Placita'' is Diels' invention and is generally disregarded by modern classicists, e.g., the 1999 ''Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy''.

Quotes which are ascribed to Aetius in scholarly essays were actually discovered in either the abridgements of Pseudo-Plutarch or Stobaeus, or Theodoret's full quotes in rare cases, or finally one of several ancient authors who provided corrections to misquotes in one of these works.

The "'''Alien'''"  ([[colloquial]]:  "'''Xenomorph XX121'''"; [[binomial name|binomial]]: ''[[wikt:internecivus#Latin|Internecivus]] [[wikt:raptus#Latin|raptus]] ["murderous thief"]''&lt;ref name=WYreport&gt;Alien: The Weyland-Yutani Report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alien: Sea of Sorrows&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A2"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Dan O'Bannon]] and [[Ronald Shusett]] (writers) and [[James Cameron]] (director)|title=''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''|medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A3"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Vincent Ward (director)|Vincent Ward]] (writer) and [[David Fincher]] (director)|title=''[[Alien 3]]''|medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a fictional [[parasitoid|endoparasitoid]] [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[species]] that is the eponymous [[antagonist]] of the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' film series]]. The species made its debut in the film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) and reappeared in the sequels ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986), ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992), and ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997), as well as the [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] films ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' (2004) and ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' (2007).

The ''Alien'' design is credited to [[Swiss (nationality)|Swiss]] surrealist and artist [[H. R. Giger]], originating in a [[lithograph]] titled ''Necronom IV'' and refined for the series' first film, ''Alien''. The practical effects for the Alien's head were designed and constructed by [[Italian people|Italian]] special effects designer [[Carlo Rambaldi]]. The species' design and life cycle have been extensively augmented, sometimes inconsistently, throughout each film.

Similar creatures of a slightly different designs named the "Deacon" makes a brief appearance in the [[Ridley Scott]] film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012). Two species, one being a different but similar creature called a "Neomorph" and the other being a variation of the Xenomorph XX121 species appear in the sequel to ''Prometheus'', ''[[Alien: Covenant]]'' (2017), which reveals the potential origin of the species.&lt;ref name=covenant&gt;{{cite video|title=[[Alien: Covenant]]|people=[[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], Dante Harper,     Jack Paglen, [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]] (writers); [[Ridley Scott]] (director)|publisher=20th Century Fox|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neo&gt;[http://www.slashfilm.com/alien-covenant-neomorph/ New ‘Alien: Covenant’ Images Reveal the Creepy ‘Neomorph’]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Alien appears in various literature and video game spin-offs from the franchises.

Unlike many other extraterrestrial races in science fiction, the Aliens are not [[sapience|sapient]] "tool-makers"; they lack a technological civilization. They are [[Predation|predatory]] creatures with no higher goals than the propagation and self-preservation of their species. Like [[wasp]]s or [[termite]]s, Aliens are [[eusociality|eusocial]], with a single fertile [[#Queen|queen]] breeding a caste of warriors, workers, or other specialists strains. The Aliens' [[biological life cycle]] involves traumatic implantation of [[endoparasitoid]] [[larvae]] inside living hosts; these "chestburster" larvae erupt from the host's body after a short incubation period, rapidly mature from juvenile into adulthood within hours, and seek out more hosts for implantation.

==Concept and creation==
[[File:H.R. Giger - Necronom IV.jpg|thumb|''Necronom IV'', Giger's 1976 surrealist print that formed the basis for the Alien's design]]
The script for the 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' was initially drafted by [[Dan O'Bannon]] and [[Ronald Shusett]]. Dan O'Bannon drafted an opening in which the crew of a mining ship are sent to investigate a mysterious message on an alien planet. He eventually settled on the threat being an alien creature; however, he could not conceive of an interesting way for it to get onto the ship. Inspired after waking from a dream, Shusett said, "I have an idea: the monster screws one of them", planting its egg in his body, and then bursting out of his chest. Both realized the idea had never been done before, and it subsequently became the core of the film.&lt;ref name="doc"&gt;''Star Beast, the [[Alien Quadrilogy]]'' boxset&lt;/ref&gt; "This is a movie about alien interspecies rape," O'Bannon said in the documentary ''[[Alien Evolution]]''. "That's scary because it hits all of our buttons."&lt;ref name="burster"/&gt; O'Bannon felt that the symbolism of "homosexual oral rape" was an effective means of discomforting male viewers.&lt;ref name="woman"/&gt;

[[File:Hrgigeralien.jpg|thumb|upright|Giger's Alien design, inspired by his earlier print ''Necronom IV'', for the film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'']]
The title of the film was decided late in the script's development. O'Bannon had quickly dropped the film's original title, ''Star Beast'', but could not think of a name to replace it. "I was running through titles, and they all stank", O'Bannon said in an interview, "when suddenly, that word ''alien'' just came out of the typewriter at me. ''Alien''. It's a noun and it's an adjective."&lt;ref name="doc"/&gt; The word ''alien'' subsequently became the title of the film and, by extension, the name of the creature itself.

Prior to writing the script to ''Alien'', O'Bannon had been working in France for Chilean cult director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s [[Alejandro Jodorowsky#Dune and Tusk (1975–1980)|planned adaptation]] of [[Frank Herbert]]'s classic science-fiction novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. Also hired for the project was Swiss [[surrealist]] artist [[H. R. Giger]]. Giger showed O'Bannon his nightmarish, monochromatic artwork, which left O'Bannon deeply disturbed. "I had never seen anything that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his work" he remembered later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Alien|author=Paul Scanlon|author2=Michael Gross|date=1979|publisher=WH Allen &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dune'' film collapsed, but O'Bannon would remember Giger when ''Alien'' was greenlit, and suggested to director [[Ridley Scott]] that he be brought on to design the Alien, saying that if he were to design a monster, it would be truly original.&lt;ref name="doc" /&gt;

[[File:Carlo Rambaldi al Giffoni Film Festival 2010 - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Carlo Rambaldi]], the creator of the mechanical head-effects for the creature, was most famous for designing the title character of the film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'']]
After O'Bannon handed him a copy of Giger's book ''[[Necronomicon (H. R. Giger)|Necronomicon]]'', Scott immediately saw the potential for Giger's designs, and chose ''Necronom IV'', a print Giger completed in 1976, as the basis for the Alien's design, citing its beauty and strong sexual overtones. That the creature could just as easily have been male or female was also a strong factor in the decision to use it. "It could just as easily fuck you before it killed you," said line producer Ivor Powell, "[which] made it all the more disconcerting."&lt;ref name="burster" /&gt; [[20th Century Fox|Fox Studios]] were initially wary of allowing Giger onto the project, saying that his works would be too disturbing for audiences, but eventually relented. Giger initially offered to completely design the Alien from scratch, but Scott mandated that he base his work on ''Necronom IV'', saying that to start over from the beginning would be too time-consuming. Giger signed on to design the adult, egg and chestburster forms, but ultimately also designed the alien planetoid LV-426 and the Space Jockey alien vessel.&lt;ref name="doc" /&gt;

Giger conceived the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, because he felt that it made them much more frightening if you could not tell they were looking at you.&lt;ref name="burster"/&gt; Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of [[pharyngeal jaws]] located at the tip of a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed ''biomechanical'', a fusion of the organic and the mechanic.&lt;ref name="burster" /&gt; His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls Royce]] car, rib bones and the [[vertebrae]] from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's [[animatronics|animatronic]] head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer [[Carlo Rambaldi]].&lt;ref name="doc" /&gt; Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]] for their design of the Alien.

[[File:HR Giger 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[H. R. Giger]], who designed and worked on the Alien and its accompanying elements]]
Scott decided on the man-in-suit approach for creating the creature onscreen. Initially circus performers were tried, then multiple actors together in the same costume, but neither proved scary. Deciding that the creature would be scarier the closer it appeared to a human, Scott decided that a single, very tall, very thin man be used. Scott was inspired by a photograph of [[Leni Riefenstahl]] standing next to a 6'4" (1.93 m) [[Nuba peoples|Nuba]] man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''HR Giger's Alien''|author=HR Giger|publisher=Sphinx|date=1979|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casting director found 6'10" (2.08 m), rail-thin graphic designer [[Bolaji Badejo]] in a local pub. Badejo went to tai chi and mime classes to learn how to slow down his movements.&lt;ref name="doc" /&gt;

Giger's design for the Alien evoked many contradictory sexual images. As critic Ximena Gallardo notes, the creature's combination of sexually evocative physical and behavioral characteristics creates "a nightmare vision of sex and death. It subdues and opens the male body to make it pregnant, and then explodes it in birth. In its adult form, the alien strikes its victims with a rigid phallic tongue that breaks through skin and bone. More than a phallus, however, the retractable tongue has its own set of snapping, metallic teeth that connects it to the castrating [[vagina dentata]]."&lt;ref name="woman" /&gt;

===Name===
This creature is named Xenomorph XX121, and has been referred to most often onscreen, and in the credits of each film, simply as the ''Alien''. It was called an alien, and an organism, in the first film. It has also been referred to as a creature,&lt;ref name="A2" /&gt; a serpent,&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt; a beast,&lt;ref name="A3" /&gt; a dragon,&lt;ref name="A3" /&gt; a monster,&lt;ref name="A2" /&gt; a nasty, or simply, a thing.&lt;ref name="A1" /&gt; The term ''xenomorph'' (lit. "alien form"—from Greek ''xeno-'', which translates as either "other" or "strange", and ''-morph'', which denotes shape) was first used by the character Lieutenant Gorman in ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt; with reference to generic extraterrestrial life. The term was erroneously assumed by some fans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The throwaway line in Aliens that spawned decades of confusion|url=https://arstechnica.com/the-multiverse/2014/08/the-throwaway-line-in-aliens-that-spawned-decades-of-confusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer specifically to this creature, and the word was used by the producers of some merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Aliens action figures|url=http://www.shelflife.net/Aliens-Action-Figures|accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species' [[binomial name]]s are given in [[Latin]] as either ''[[wikt:internecivus#Latin|Internecivus]] [[wikt:raptus#Latin|raptus]]'' (meant as "murderous thief") in the ''Alien Quadrilogy'' DVD or ''[[wikt:lingua#Latin|Lingua]] [[wikt:foedus#Adjective|foeda]] [[wikt:Acheron#Latin|acheronsis]]'' (meant as "foul tongue from [[Acheron]]")&lt;ref group=NB&gt;With ''acheronsis'' instead of ''[[wikt:acheronensis#Latin|acheronensis]]'', ''[[wikt:acheronteus#Latin|acherontea]]'' or ''[[wikt:acherunticus#Latin|acheruntica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in some comic books.&lt;ref&gt;The comic book ''[[Aliens versus Predator versus The Terminator]]'' includes the binomial name ''Linguafoeda acheronsis''.&lt;/ref&gt; The main Alien from ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' is listed in the credits as "Grid", after a grid-like wound received during the film from a Predator's razor net.&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt; ''[[Alien: Covenant]]'' actually credits the Alien as Xenomorph, while also listing a different variety of the creature as the [[#Neomorph|Neomorph]].&lt;ref name=covenant/&gt;&lt;ref name=neo/&gt; In ''The Weyland-Yutani Report'', the Alien was specifically referred to as "Xenomorph XX121".&lt;ref name=WYreport/&gt;

==Characteristics==
As the film series has progressed, the creature's design has been modified in many ways, including differing numbers of fingers and limb joints, and variations in the design of the Alien's head.

===Appearance===
[[File:Alien (1979) - The Alien.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Giger's Alien, as portrayed by [[Bolaji Badejo]] in [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'']]
When standing upright, the Aliens are bipedal in form, though depending on their host species, they will either adopt a more hunched stance, or remain quadrupedal when walking or sprinting. Their overall stance and general behavior is a result of the mixture of the DNA of the embryo and the host. They have a skeletal, [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] appearance and are usually colored in muted shades of black, gray or bronze. Their body heat matches the [[ambient temperature]] of the environment in which they are found, so they do not radiate heat, making them indistinguishable from their surroundings through thermal imaging.&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt; In most of the films, adult Aliens are capable of running and crawling along ceilings and walls.&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A3"/&gt; They have great physical strength, having been shown to be capable of breaking through welded steel doors in numbers.&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;

Aliens have segmented, blade-tipped tails. The sharp tip was initially a small, scorpion-like barb,&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Dan O'Bannon]], [[Ronald Shusett]] (writers) and [[Ridley Scott]] (director)|title=[[Alien (film)|Alien]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from ''Aliens'' onwards the blade design increased in size and changed in appearance to more closely resemble a slashing weapon.&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AvP"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Paul W. S. Anderson]] (writer/director)|title=''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''|medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; From ''Alien: Resurrection'' onwards, the tails have a flat ridge of spines at the base of the blade. This was introduced to help them swim convincingly,&lt;ref name="Mutation"&gt;''Unnatural Mutation – Creature Design'', ''Alien Quadrilogy'', 2003, 20th Century Fox&lt;/ref&gt; and was left intact in the subsequent crossovers. The original shooting script for ''Aliens'' and the novelization both featured a scene in which Lieutenant Gorman is "stung" by the barb tail and rendered unconscious; in the final cut of the movie, Gorman is knocked out by falling crates. As a weapon, the strength of the tail is very effective, having been shown to be strong enough to impale and lift a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] with seemingly little effort.

They have elongated, cylindrical [[skull]]s, but possess no visible eyes, though in the original ''Alien'' film, the top of the creature's head was translucent, with empty, human-looking eye sockets within. In the novelization of ''Alien'', the character Ash speculates that the Xenomorphs "see" by way of electrical impulse, similar to a shark's lateral line.  This method is illustrated in the original ''Alien vs Predator'' PC game and reused for the "Predalien" 28 years later. There is a cyclopean species of Xenomorph, which is the creature in its original form; it has a single large eye under its natural silicon/keratin forehead which can give the creature 180-degree vision. The Aliens' inner set of jaws are powerful enough to smash through bone and metal.&lt;ref name="AvP" /&gt; How the creatures see is uncertain; in ''Alien 3'', a spherical lens was used to illustrate the Alien's point of view, so, when the film was projected anamorphically, the image exhibited severe distortion. In the novelization of the movie ''Alien'', the creature is held mesmerized by a spinning green light for several minutes.

In ''Aliens'', the adult creatures have a more textured head rather than a smooth carapace. In the commentary for ''Aliens'', it was speculated that this was part of the maturation of the creatures, as they had been alive far longer than the original Alien, although James Cameron stated that he simply left the carapace off because he liked them better that way.&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt; The smooth design of the carapace would be used again in ''Alien 3'' and ''Alien: Resurrection'', although made narrower with a longer muzzle and more prominent chin. This design would be kept in ''Alien versus Predator'',&lt;ref name="Creature FX"&gt;{{cite book | author=Gillis, Alec | author2=Woodruff, Tom | last-author-amp=yes| title = ''AVP: Alien vs. Predator: The Creature Effects of ADI''| date = 2004| page = 128| isbn = 1-84576-004-2 | publisher=Titan Books | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abandoned in ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' in favor of the ribbed design.

Throughout their appearances, human-spawned Aliens have been shown to have different numbers of fingers. In ''Alien'', the creature has webbed, six-fingered hands. In ''Aliens'', the number of fingers is reduced to three (two "paired" and a single, opposable thumb), and they are shown to be much longer and more skeletal. In ''Alien: Resurrection'', the number of digits is increased to four, with two long middle fingers and a pair of thumbs. This design is kept in the ''Alien vs. Predator'' films, though the hands were made bulkier in order to make the Aliens seem more formidable against the Predators.&lt;ref name="AVPmaking"&gt;{{cite book | author=Alec Gillis | author2=Tom Woodruff Jr. | last-author-amp=yes| title = ''Alien vs. Predator: The Creature Effects of ADI'' | date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aliens have been alternatively portrayed as both [[plantigrade]] and [[digitigrade]] organisms, usually relative to their host. Human-spawned Aliens were usually portrayed as having humanoid hind limbs, while in ''Alien 3'', the featured Alien sported double-jointed legs due to its quadrupedal host. This characteristic would be continued in ''Alien: Resurrection'' for the human-spawned Aliens. Tom Woodruff, who had previously played the "dog-alien" in ''Alien 3'', described the human-spawned Aliens in ''Resurrection'' as feeling more like a dog than the previous creature, despite having been born from human hosts.&lt;ref name="Beauties and the Beast"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human-spawned Alien warriors would revert to a plantigrade posture in ''Alien vs. Predator''.

===Physiology===
Alien blood is an extremely potent [[acid]] and is capable of corroding almost any substance on contact with alarming speed. It is dull yellow in color, and appears to be pressurized inside the body so that it spurts out with great force when the creature is wounded. [[Ron Cobb]] suggested the idea of the Alien having acid blood as a plausible means to make the creature "unkillable"; if one were to use traditional firearms or explosives to attack it, its blood would eat through the hull of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;''Alien'' commentary, Alien Quadrilogy boxset&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Alien'' novelization suggests that, at least at the "facehugger" stage, the acid is not blood but a fluid maintained under pressure between a double layer of skin.&lt;ref name="fluidnotblood"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Foster | first =Alan Dean | author-link =Alan Dean Foster | last2 =O'Bannon | first2 =Dan | author2-link =Dan O'Bannon | date = 1979 | title =Alien | publisher=Macdonald and Jane's | isbn =0-354-04436-2 | location =London | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' documentary: "Science of the Alien", it is hypothesized that the Aliens' acid blood could be some type of "[[Hydrogen sulphide|hydrosulphuric acid]]" compound due to its corrosiveness and the conspicuously toxic effects on living human tissue. The documentary also speculates that Aliens are immune to their own acidic and toxic liquids due to an endobiological build-up, similar to the human stomach's ability to protect itself from its own digestive fluids. The documentary takes this hypothesis one step further and speculates that the Alien organisms' protection system against its own toxic hydrosulphuric acid is basically a bio-organically produced [[Teflon]] insulation.&lt;ref&gt;[Shane Salerno (writer) Colin and Greg Strause (directors). (2008). ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--so, are the Teflon thing and the "protection system" two different things, or did the source say they're one and the same (I'm at work, so I can't check a YouTube video on it right now) and the sentence is just wonky? the grammar/syntax here makes it a little unclear what we're trying to say.--&gt; In the original ''Alien'', the facehugger is shown to be able to "spit" acid, dissolving the faceplate of Kane's helmet and allowing the creature immediate access inside. This ability is also exhibited by adult Aliens in ''Alien 3'' and ''Alien: Resurrection''; much like a [[spitting cobra]], they use it to blind and immobilize their victims.&lt;ref name="A3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A4"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Joss Whedon]] (writer) and [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]]|title=''[[Alien Resurrection]]''|medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aliens can produce a thick, strong [[resin]] that they use to build their hives and to [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] their victims, and they can use the walls of their hives as [[camouflage]].&lt;ref name="MacFarland"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sipos|first1=Thomas|title=Horror Film Aesthetics: Creating the Visual Language of Fear|date=2010|publisher=MacFarland|isbn=0786458348|page=80|ref=SiposBook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aliens also salivate heavily in the form of a sticky, clear slime; while not a toxic substance in and of itself, it is common for the ''Alien'' films to use it as a suspense-building device, wherein a character will notice the falling saliva before noticing its source lying in wait above them.&lt;ref name="MacFarland"/&gt;

===Intelligence===
During various events in ''Aliens'' on the LV-426 colony Hadley's Hope, in ''Alien: Resurrection'' on the ''USM Auriga'', and in the crossover movie ''Alien vs Predator'', the species displayed [[observational learning]] and [[problem solving|problem-solving]] skills,&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A4"/&gt; and in the former two cases the Aliens learned how to operate machinery at a very basic level. On LV-426, they were able to cut power in a section of the complex to gain access to the humans, and the Alien queen learns to board an elevator by observing Ripley and Newt escaping in the one beside it. The novelization of the film notes that the queen establishing her "nest" at the base's main power plant could have been chosen either for the feral, animal reason of the warmth that it would provide or for the rational reason of selecting a location where any attackers would be unable to destroy her without destroying the entire facility. In the director's commentary for ''Aliens'', James Cameron noted that the creatures in ''Aliens'' had been alive for far longer than the Alien in the original, and had more time to learn about their environment.&lt;ref name="mother" /&gt; On the ''USM Auriga'' in ''Alien: Resurrection'', the Aliens kill one of their own, using its blood to melt through their enclosure and escape; in ''[[Alien vs. Predator]]'', they use a similar strategy to free the queen from her chains. An Alien also uses acid spurting from its severed tail as an improvised weapon, indicating they are fully aware of the effects of their acid blood.

==Life cycle==
{{main|List of Alien morphs in the Alien franchise}}
Aliens are [[eusocial]] life-forms with a [[Caste (biology)|caste]] system ruled over by a [[#Queen|queen]].&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A4"/&gt; Their life cycle comprises several distinct stages: they begin their lives as an [[#Egg|egg]], which hatches a [[parasitoid]] larval form known as a [[#Facehugger|facehugger]], which then attaches itself to a living [[Host (biology)|host]] by, as its name suggests, latching onto its face. In the ''[[Alien 3]]'' novelization, Ripley commented that this parasitoid would probably be able to use a host as small as a cat or as large as an elephant.

The facehugger then "impregnates" the host with an [[embryo]], known as a "[[#Chestburster|chestburster]]",&lt;ref group=NB&gt;The terms "facehugger" and "chestburster" date at least as far back as ''The Book of Alien'' and ''HR Giger's Alien''—behind-the-scenes scrapbooks composed the year of the original film's release—and are used frequently by the film's cast and crew in retrospect.&lt;/ref&gt; which, after a period of [[gestation]], erupts violently from the host's chest, resulting in the death of the host.

The chestburster then matures to an adult phase, shedding its skin and replacing its cells with [[polarization (waves)|polarized]] [[silicon]]. Due to [[horizontal gene transfer]] during the gestation period, the Alien also takes on some of the basic physical attributes of the host from which it was born, allowing the individual alien to adapt to the host's environment.

The adult phase of the Alien is known by various different names. The adult Aliens have been referred to as "drones", "warriors", "workers", and sometimes "soldiers", similar to the way [[ant]]s have been defined. The names of the adult phase have also been used to name different types of adult phases of the Alien in numerous sources, including video games, comic books, novels, and the films, but only in the commentaries by the team who created the films. No official name has been given to the adult stage of the Alien in the films themselves.

===Queen===
[[File:Alien (1986) - Alien queen.jpg|thumb|Ripley's first encounter with a queen]]
Queen Aliens are significantly larger and stronger than the normal adults, being approximately {{convert|4.5|m}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sideshowtoy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=082504alien2 Sideshowtoy]. Retrieved February 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Their body structure differs also, having two pairs of arms, one large and one small. The queen's head is larger than those of other adult Aliens and is protected by a large, flat crest, like a crown, which varies from queen to queen. Unlike other aliens, the queen's external mouth is separately segmented from the rest of her head, allowing her to turn her mouth left and right almost to the point where it is facing perpendicular to the direction of the rest of her head. In the second film, ''Aliens'', unlike other adults and queens, the queen had high-heel protrusions from her feet.

Egg-laying Alien queens possess an immense [[ovipositor]] attached to their lower torso, similar to a queen termite's. Unlike insect [[Queen (bee)|queens]], there appears to be no need for an Alien queen's eggs to be fertilized.&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A4"/&gt; When attached to her ovipositor, the queen is supported by a "biomechanical [[throne]]"&lt;ref&gt;James Cameron, ''Alien Evolution: Aliens''&lt;/ref&gt; that consists of a lattice of struts resembling massive insect legs.

In the original cut of ''Alien'', the Alien possessed a complete lifecycle, with the still-living bodies of its victims converted into eggs. However, the scene showing the crew converted into eggs was cut for reasons of pacing, leaving the ultimate origin of the eggs obscure. This allowed ''Aliens'' director [[James Cameron]] to introduce a concept he had initially conceived for a spec script called ''Mother'',&lt;ref name="mother"&gt;''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', film commentary, ''Alien Quadrilogy'' box set&lt;/ref&gt; a massive mother Alien queen which laid eggs and formed the basis for the Aliens' life cycle. Cameron conceived the queen as a monstrous analogue to Ripley's own maternal role in the film.&lt;ref name="mother"/&gt; In that vein, some critics have compared it to [[Grendel's mother]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.nwe.ufl.edu/~jchapman/beowulf/beomain.html ''The Alien Trilogy: A New Beowulf''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209102624/http://web.nwe.ufl.edu/~jchapman/beowulf/beomain.html |date=February 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.nwe.ufl.edu/~jchapman/beowulf/queenA.html ''Alien Queen'' in Cameron's ''Aliens'' (1986).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115222308/http://web.nwe.ufl.edu/~jchapman/beowulf/queenA.html |date=January 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The queen was designed by Cameron in collaboration with special effects artist [[Stan Winston]], based upon an initial painting Cameron had done at the start of the project. The Winston Studio created a test foamcore queen before constructing the full hydraulic [[puppet]] which was used for most of the scenes involving the large Alien. Two people were inside working the twin sets of arms, and puppeteers off-screen worked its jaws and head. Although at the end of the film, the queen was presented full-body fighting the power-loader, the audience never sees the legs of the queen, save those of the small-scale puppet that appears only briefly. In ''Aliens'', Cameron used very selective camera-angles on the queen, using the '[[wikt:less is more|less is more]]' style of photography. Subsequently, the movie won an [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Oscar for Visual Effects]]. An adult queen was to reappear in ''Alien Resurrection''. The original mechanical head previously used in ''Aliens'' was provided by [[Bob Burns III|Bob Burns]] and was an altered design. It was repainted with a blend of green and brown, giving it a shimmering, insect-like quality. This color concept would be abandoned in ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' in favour of the original black color scheme.&lt;ref name="AVPmaking"/&gt;

In the climax of ''Alien vs. Predator'', the queen's basic design was altered to make her more "streamlined" in appearance and her overall size was increased to six meters (20 feet) tall. Other changes include the removal of the "high-heel" protrusions on her legs, including additional spines on her head and making her waist thinner because there was no need for puppeteers inside her chest. The [[animatronic]] queen had 47 points of hydraulic motion.&lt;ref name="AVPmaking"/&gt;

''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' (2007) introduced a younger form of the full-grown queen, albeit with traits inherited from its [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] host. Recalling the facehugger's method of embryo implantation, the Predalien uses its inner mouth to directly deposit multiple chestburster embryos into pregnant female hosts, also using its mandibles to latch on the faces of said hosts, completely bypassing the need for facehuggers.&lt;ref name="belly"&gt;"The bellybursters were actually in the first draft that Colin and I read...They had the bellybursters...caused by an alien warrior...We actually made it the Predalien that was reproducing in this fashion" –Greg Strause, "AvP-R: Preparing for War: Development and Production" featurette, from the ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' Region 1 Extreme Unrated Set DVD&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by the Brothers Strause as a means of quickly building an army of Aliens before the young queen evolves into its sedentary, egg-laying state.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''"Basically the Predalien's kind of a baby queen—there's a phase in between warrior alien and full-blown queen...they do this thing with embryo implantation.. the idea with that was, how does a baby queen quickly form her own little mini-drone army to get the hive built before she evolves into the final state where she can't completely defend herself?"''--Colin Strause, "AvP-R: Preparing for War: Development and Production" featurette, from the ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' Region 1 Extreme Unrated Set DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egg===
The eggs laid by the queen are ellipsoidal, leathery objects between one-half and one meter (two and three feet) high with a four-lobed opening at the top. The eggs can remain in a stasis mode for years, possibly indefinitely, until nearby movement is detected. As a potential host approaches, the egg's lobes unfold like flower petals, and the parasitic facehugger extracts itself from the egg and attaches itself to the potential host. Giger initially designed the eggs with a much more obvious vaginal appearance, complete with an "inner and outer vulva".&lt;ref name="littlegiger"&gt;[http://www.littlegiger.com/articles/files/Cinefantastique_09_01.pdf H. R. Giger Alien Design by Frederic Albert Levy], p.36&lt;/ref&gt; The producers complained that Catholic countries would ban the film if the allusion was too strong, so Giger doubled the lobes to four so that, in his words, "seen from above, they would form the cross that people in Catholic countries are so fond of looking at".&lt;ref name="littlegiger"/&gt; The interior of the original egg was composed of "Nottingham lace" ([[caul fat]]), which is the lining of a cow's stomach. In the first film, the quick shot of the facehugger erupting from the egg was done with sheep's intestine.&lt;ref name="doc"/&gt; Initially, the egg remained totally stationary except for the hydraulic movement of the lobes; however, by ''Alien: Resurrection'', the entire egg was made to ripple as it opened. In Alien, the Director's Cut, an additional scene shows still living crew members being cocooned into new eggs, either morphing into a new embryo or acting as a food source for the facehugger inside the egg.

===Facehugger===
[[File:Alien-The Facehugger.png|thumb|The facehugger seen in ''Alien'']]
A facehugger is the second stage in the Alien's life cycle. It has eight long, finger-like legs, which allow it to crawl rapidly, and a long tail adapted for making great leaps. These particular appendages give it an appearance somewhat comparable to [[Chelicerata|chelicerate]] [[Arthropoda|arthropods]] such as [[arachnid]]s and [[horseshoe crab]]s.

The facehugger is a [[parasitoid]]; its only purpose is to make contact with the host's mouth for the implantation process by gripping its legs around the victim's head and wrapping its tail around the host's neck. Upon making contact, the facehugger administers a cynose-based paralytic in order to render it unconscious and immobile.&lt;ref&gt;Aliens Colonial Marines Tech Manual&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WYreport/&gt; During a successful attachment, the facehugger will insert a [[proboscis]] down the host's throat while simultaneously implanting an embryo. The host is kept alive, and the creature breathes for the host.&lt;ref name="A1"/&gt; Attempts to remove facehuggers generally prove fatal,&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt; as the parasitoid will respond by tightening its tail around the host's neck, and its acidic blood prevents it from being cut away. In addition, its grip on the host's head is strong enough to tear the host's face off if it is forcibly removed.&lt;ref name="A1"/&gt;

Once the Alien embryo is implanted, the facehugger will remain attached until the implant is secure, which can take anywhere from less than a minute to 16 hours. Once this happens, the parasite detaches, crawls away, and dies.&lt;ref name=WYreport/&gt; The victim awakens with no awareness of the implantation, believing themselves to have been asleep, and appears to have a normal, healthy bodily function.

According to ''AVPR: Science of the Xenomorph'', a behind-the-scenes documentary on ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'', it is theorized that facehuggers may implant a viral agent that "commands" the host's cells to grow the chestburster, as opposed to an implanted embryo.&lt;ref&gt;''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' 2-disc ultimate combat edition&lt;/ref&gt; This would explain how the resulting alien is able to adopt the characteristics of its host.

Giger's original design for the facehugger was a much larger creature with eyes and a spring-loaded tail. Later, in response to comments from the filmmakers, Giger reduced the creature's size substantially.&lt;ref name="dvd"&gt;HR Giger, ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien'', Alien Quadrilogy Box-set&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Giger assumed that the facehugger would wrap around the outside of the astronaut's helmet, but Scott decided that it would have far more impact if the facehugger were revealed once the helmet was removed. Scott and Giger realized that the facehugger should burn through the helmet's faceplate with its acid blood; subsequent redesigns of the space helmet included a far larger faceplate to allow for this.&lt;ref&gt;Giger 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan O'Bannon]] initially conceived the facehugger as somewhat resembling an octopus, possessing tentacles. However, when he received [[H. R. Giger]]'s designs, which substituted tentacles with fingerlike digits, he found Giger's design concept to be superior. Since no one was available at the time, O'Bannon decided to design the facehugger prop himself. The technical elements of the musculature and bone were added by [[Ron Cobb]]. Giger's initial design for the smaller facehugger had the fingers facing forward, but O'Bannon's redesign shifted the legs to the side. When the [[foam rubber]] sculpture of the facehugger was produced, O'Bannon asked that it should remain unpainted, believing the rubber, which resembled human skin, was more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Dan O'Bannon, audio commentary, ''Alien'', from the ''Alien Quadrilogy'' DVD set&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', the facehuggers were redesigned by [[Stan Winston]] so that they would be capable of movement. Unlike the creatures in the first film, the creatures would take a much more active role in impregnating their victims. When Ripley throws one off her, the facehugger was now capable of scuttling across the floor and leaping at its prey, wrapping its tail around the victim's throat. The facehugger is also shown to be capable of independently surviving outside of its egg. Due to the film's budget, only two fully working facehuggers were built.

In ''Alien 3'', another addition, a "super-facehugger" that would carry the embryo of the queen Alien, was planned, but ultimately dropped.&lt;ref name="A3org"&gt;Alien3: ''Adaptive Organism: Creature Design'', from the Alien Quadrilogy boxset.&lt;/ref&gt; The super-facehugger is briefly glimpsed in the Assembly cut of ''Alien 3'', but not identified as such.&lt;ref name="A3org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alien3: Assembly cut&lt;/ref&gt; It made a brief appearance in the canonical ''Alien'' book called ''Alien: Sea of Sorrows'', set a while after the events of ''Alien Resurrection'', about the grandson of Ripley Clone 8, Ellen Ripley's clone.

===Chestburster===
[[File:Alien-The Chestburster.png|thumb|The chestburster from the original film]]
After implantation, facehuggers die and the embryo's host wakes up afterward, showing no considerable outward negative symptoms and a degree of [[amnesia]] regarding events at the time of implantation. Symptoms build acutely after detachment of the facehugger, the most common being sore throat, slight [[nausea]], increased congestion, and moderate to extreme hunger.&lt;ref name="A1"/&gt; In later stages where the [[incubation period]] is extended in preparation of a queen birth, symptoms will include a shortness of breath, exhaustion, and [[hemorrhaging]] (detectable through biological scanners and present in nosebleeds or other seemingly random bleeding incidents), as well as chest pains inflicted, either in lack of chest space due to the chestburster's presence or even premature attempts to escape the host. The incubating embryo takes on some of the host's [[DNA]] or [[Phenotypic trait|traits]], such as [[bipedalism]], [[quadrupedalism]],&lt;ref name="A3"/&gt; possessing the [[mandible]]s of a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]],&lt;ref name="AvP-R"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Shane Salerno]] (writer) [[Brothers Strause|Colin and Greg Strause]] (directors)|title=[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]] |medium=DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other structural changes. According to Weyland-Yutani scientists in ''Aliens: Colonial Marines'', the chestburster will draw nutrients from the host's body in order to develop a placenta as it grows, attaching itself to several major organs in the process. The placenta has cancerous qualities, such that even if the embryo were removed surgically, the placenta would simply cause the affected organs to shut down, resulting in death. Over the course of one to 24 hours—indeterminable in some cases, and sometimes up to a week, in the case of some queens—the embryo develops into a chestburster, at which point, it emerges, violently and fatally ripping open the chest of the host. There is no on-screen explanation of the reasons for the different incubation times. Fully-grown aliens may avoid harming species acting as hosts for un-emerged chestbursters, though this may only be in the case of a queen embryo.

The emerging alien varies in size from a guinea pig to a large dog, depending on the size and species of the host, and its appearance and adaptive characteristics are also determined by the host. Typically, its first instinct upon emerging is to flee and hide until full maturation.

The chestburster was designed by ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' director [[Ridley Scott]] and constructed by special effects artist [[Roger Dicken]].&lt;ref name="woman"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4ecFu4B_CpoC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=chestburster+roger+dicken&amp;source=web&amp;ots=m0mCKTtAB9&amp;sig=qmXk9zZSd6XdfHDqHzR_rtdAPzE Alien Woman: The Making of Lt Ellen Ripley] Ximena Gellardo, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Giger had produced a model of a chestburster that resembled a "degenerate plucked turkey"&lt;ref&gt;Giger p. 56 {{clarify|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2017}} and was far too large to fit inside a ribcage. Much to Giger's dismay, his model reduced the production team to fits of laughter on sight. Scott drafted a series of alternative designs for the chestburster based on the philosophy of working "back [from the adult] to the child" and ultimately produced "something phallic".&lt;ref name="burster"&gt;''Alien Evolution'', in the [[Alien Quadrilogy]] box set&lt;/ref&gt; The chestburster in the original ''Alien'' was armless, but arms were added in ''Aliens'' to facilitate the creature crawling its way out of its host's corpse.&lt;ref name="Winston"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jody Duncan|author2=James Cameron|last-author-amp=yes|title=The Winston Effect: The Art and History of Stan Winston Studio|date=2007|page=336|isbn=1-84576-150-2|publisher=Titan|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept would be abandoned in ''Alien: Resurrection'', but return in ''Alien: Covenant''.

When a chestburster erupts from the body of its host, it is less than {{convert|30|cm|ft}} tall. However, it soon undergoes a dramatic growth spurt, reaching adult size in a matter of hours; in ''Alien'', the chestburster had grown to {{convert|2|m|ft}} in height by the time the ''Nostromo'' crew located it again.&lt;ref group=NB&gt;In ''Aliens'', Ripley claims that the creature killed the entire crew in 24 hours, so the growth stage must be under one day&lt;/ref&gt; The chestburster is shown to have molted before reaching maturity.&lt;ref name="A1"/&gt; In ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'', Alien warriors are shown who are still growing, showing shedding skin. In the unrated cut, the [[#Predalien|Predalien]] is shown wiping off its final molted skin at the film's start.

==Alternative forms==
{{main|List of Alien morphs in the Alien franchise}}
Aliens take on various forms depending on the characteristics of their hosts. Most of the Aliens seen to date have been human-spawned, but a number of Aliens born from other hosts have also been seen. Some of these are also a different variants or species altogether such the Neomorph and Deacon.

==="Dragon"===
[[File:Aliens (1992) - Alien.jpg|thumb|The quadrupedal Alien variant from ''Alien 3'']]
The "Dog Alien" or "Ox Alien",  (also known as "Runner Alien" in [[List of castes from the Alien expanded universe|the expanded universe stories]]) and referred to in-film as "Dragon", was introduced in ''[[Alien 3]]''. The creature itself shares the same basic physical configuration and instincts as the other Aliens shown in the previous films, although there are several differences due to the host it was spawned from (a dog in the theatrical cut, an [[ox]] in the DVD assembly cut). The dog Alien in its chestburster form is a miniature version of the adult, unlike the larval human- and Predator-spawned chestbursters. The adult is primarily [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]], has [[digitigrade]] hind legs, and lacks the dorsal tubes of the human-spawned variety. The only differences behavior-wise was that this Alien behaved more like a dog or another quadrupedal animal that generally is prone to using its mouth instead of its front legs as its primary weapon to attack and maul its victims with its teeth. This Alien, even when actively provoked, would not attack or kill Ripley, due to the queen growing inside her. This, however, changed towards the movie's climax, at which point the monster, after surviving a torrent of molten lead, burst from the liquid and went into a rampage, pursuing Ripley and presumably attempting to kill her until she destroyed it by showering it with freezing water, causing it to explode from [[thermal shock]].

====Concept and credit controversy====
Originally, H. R. Giger was approached on July 28, 1990, by [[David Fincher]] and [[Tim Zinnemann]], and was asked to redesign his own creations for ''Alien 3''. Giger's new designs included an aquatic face-hugger and a four-legged version of the adult Alien. Giger said in an interview "I had special ideas to make it more interesting. I designed a new creature, which was much more elegant and beastly, compared to my original. It was a four-legged Alien, more like a lethal [[Felidae|feline]]—a [[Leopard|panther]] or something. It had a kind of skin that was built up from other creatures—much like a [[symbiosis]]." However, when Tom Woodruff and Alec Gillis of [[Amalgamated Dynamics]] told Giger that they had their own design, Giger expressed himself as "very upset" and that the creature he had especially designed was his "baby". Even after the production severed contact, Giger continued to fax suggestions to Fincher and made full-scale drawings and a sculpt of the Alien, all of which were rejected.

{{quote|text="David Fincher neglected to inform me that Woodruff and Gillis were also contracted to take care of the redesign of the Alien—I found out much later... I thought I had the job and that Woodruff and Gillis would work from my plans. On their side, they were convinced that it was their job and accepted my 'suggestions' with pleasure. They believed that all my effort was based on a huge love for the matter, because I worked hard even after my contract was over."}}

Giger would later be angered by the end credits of the released film presenting him as merely the creator of the original creature, and the fact that ADI personnel gave a series of interviews that minimized Giger's contribution. Fox eventually reimbursed Giger, but only after he refused to be interviewed for their behind-the-scenes documentary of ''Alien 3''.

However, Giger would comment that he thought the resulting film was "okay" and that the Alien was "better than in the second film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrgiger.com/frame.htm |title=The Official Website |publisher=HR Giger |accessdate=2009-03-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228100118/http://www.hrgiger.com/frame.htm| archivedate= February 28, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newborn===
[[File:Alien-Newborn.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The "Newborn", seen here with Ripley in ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'']]
In ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'', due to significant genetic tampering in an attempt to recover DNA from the deceased Ellen Ripley and the Alien queen within her, the resulting cloned Aliens show a number of minor human traits. The cloned queen inherits a perversion of a human womb, and as a result, it ceases to lay eggs and gives birth to a [[humanoid]] [[mutant]] hybrid. Physically, the human/Alien Newborn is very different from other alien young, being larger, with pale, translucent skin, a [[skull]]-shaped face with eyes, a human tongue, and a complete absence of a tail. The Newborn fails to bond with its Alien queen mother, killing it, and imprinting on the Ripley clone instead.

The Newborn creature was originally scripted by [[Joss Whedon]] as being an eyeless, ivory-white quadruped with red veins running along the sides of its head. It had an inner jaw, with the addition of a pair of pincers on the sides of its head. These pincers would have been used to immobilize its prey as it drained it of blood through the inner jaw. The creature was originally going to rival the queen in size, but [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]] asked ADI to make the human/Alien [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]], known as the Newborn, more human than Alien. The Newborn's eyes and nose were added to improve its expressions to make it a character, rather than just a "killing machine", and give it depth as a human-like creature.

===Predalien===
[[File:Alienvspredator-2-d-1.jpg|thumb|The Predalien as depicted in ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'']]
This variation is the result of a facehugger impregnating a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]]. The "Predalien" was first depicted in a painting by [[Dave Dorman]], and subsequently featured in the ''Aliens versus Predator'' comics and games. A Predalien chestburster debuted in the final scene of ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' (2004), but did not make a film appearance until ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' (2007).

The Predalien shares many characteristics with its hosts, such as long hair-like appendages, [[mandible]]s, skin color, and similar vocalizations. It is a large, bulky creature, and possesses physical strength greater than that of human-spawned Aliens. Like human-born Aliens, it is also shown to be stronger than its host species, as evidenced by its ability to pin, push, and knock a Predator away with ease.&lt;ref&gt;AVP-R: Crossbreed: Creating The PredAlien (DVD), Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem 2-disc ultimate combat edition, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deacon===
The dark-blue Deacon is a different species that makes an appearance in ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'', though it clearly shares traits similar to the Xenomorph, including a similar life-cycle. The Deacon is the result of a Trilobite, which is a large facehugger-like creature, attacking and impregnating an Engineer. After some time, it will burst out of its host, with the notable difference that it is "born" almost fully developed in regards to its limbs and structure. Its fate is unknown, though the tie-in comic book ''Prometheus: Fire and Stone'', also set on LV-223, features a mutated mountain, with acidic veins which are implied to be the heavily mutated Deacon.&lt;ref&gt;Wreckage and Rage: Making Alien 3 (DVD), Alien Quadrilogy (Alien 3) bonus disc, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neomorph===
The pale-white Neomorph is featured in ''[[Alien: Covenant]]''.&lt;ref name=neo/&gt; It was created through exposure to spores found growing on the Engineer homeworld. The embryonic Neomorph then gestates inside the host until it bursts out of its host's back, throat, or possibly other areas, using mostly its head, which is sharp and pointed, similar to the Deacon. Like the Xenomorph, the Neomorph has a tail which is strong enough to tear off a human jaw. The Neomorph is a less weaponized version of the Xenomorph and lacks the facial features and biomechanical traits of the latter. The Neomorph is far more feral than the traditional Xenomorph; they are voracious predators, often eating the corpses of their victims. Unlike the Xenomorph, the Neomorph appears to lack a hive structure since they propagate through mutated animal life.&lt;ref name=covenant/&gt;

==Cultural impact==
In the years since the release of ''Alien'', the Alien has become one of the world's most recognized movie monsters and a popular-cultural icon. In 2003, the Alien was voted as the 14th most memorable screen villain by the [[American Film Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 YEARS...100 HEROES &amp; VILLAINS |work=American Film Institute |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/handv.aspx |accessdate=2008-02-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023071414/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx |archivedate=October 23, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] co-founder [[Chris Stein]], who was a friend of Giger, pondered in an interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'd like to see someone even vaguely compile how many versions of the Alien are floating around the world in models and stuff; there must be close to 100,000–little toys, things. All the Japanese horror comics just plunder his style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Talented Mr Giger|author=Romy Ashby|work=space.com|url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/movies/giger_000330.html|date=2000|accessdate=2008-02-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515132506/http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/movies/giger_000330.html|archivedate=May 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of Alien-inspired works include the classic video games ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Contra|work=Gaming Target|url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=5592|accessdate=2008-02-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080310080309/http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=5592| archivedate= March 10, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Metroid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IGN Presents The History of Metroid|work=IGN|url=http://uk.games.ign.com/articles/815/815011p1.html|accessdate=2008-03-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202173922/http://uk.games.ign.com/articles/815/815011p1.html|archivedate=February 2, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aliens (both grown-up versions and facehuggers) also appear in the second-last stage of [[Turrican II: The Final Fight|''Turrican II'']] and as a boss figure in ''[[Mega Turrican]]''.

In the classic parody film ''[[Spaceballs]]'', in the final sequence, a chestbuster is born in a space restaurant and starts dancing and singing, while the 2009 film ''[[Planet 51]]'' features small dog-like Xenomorphs with acid urine.

Heinrich, the final boss in the 2001 comedic video game ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' (and its 2005 [[Video game remake|remake]] ''[[Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded]]''), is a parody of the Alien queen as it appeared in ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''. Heinrich not only looks very similar to the queen in design, but the reference is further alluded when [[Conker the Squirrel|Conker]] uses a yellow, mechanical exoskeleton to defeat it, as well as using the line "Get away from her, you bitch!" as Heinrich looked down upon Berri's body, which is a direct reference to [[Ellen Ripley]] battling the queen during the film's final act.

The Aliens have appeared in many [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]] (including a large number of [[intercompany crossover]]s) in comic books and other media such as novels, toys, and video games. The largest of these crossovers is the ''[[Alien vs. Predator]]'' franchise, in which the Aliens battle the [[Predator (fictional species)|Predators]]. This was an idea that came to comic book artist [[Chris Warner (comics)|Chris Warner]] in early 1989. He and other people at [[Dark Horse Comics]] were trying to come up with a good character combo for a new comics series. Dark Horse had been publishing ''[[Aliens (comic book)|Aliens]]'' comic book under license from [[20th Century Fox]] since 1987. In 1990, the first depiction of the idea in film appeared in ''[[Predator 2]]'', when an Alien skull, sculpted by Kevin Hudson,&lt;ref name="Winston"/&gt; appeared as one of the trophies in the Predator spacecraft.

In the 1995 film ''[[Toy Story]]'', one of the games at Pizza Planet, Whack-a-Alien, features aliens similar to the chestbursters.

Because Dark Horse possessed the rights to the franchise in comics, it has been able to feature likenesses of the alien in its other licensed comic books. For example, it did this in a mini-issue of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'' which was billed in the media as an ''Alien'' crossover and an ''[[Animaniacs]]'' episode also featured it. A variation of the alien appears in the ''[[Regular Show]]'' episode Terror Tales of the Park VI in the "Alien Roommate" segment. A new variation of an Alien is featured as a guest character in the 2015 [[fighting game]] ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'', opposite the [[Predator (fictional species)|Predator]]. This version uses retractable blades in its arms, similar to ''Mortal Kombat''{{'}}s Tarkatan species, due to having strains of Tarkatan's [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turi|first1=Tim|title=Report: Xenomorph And Leatherface Coming To Mortal Kombat X|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/12/03/xenomorph-and-leatherface-coming-to-mortal-kombat-x.aspx|website=Game Informer|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giger's Alien was iconic enough to have an [[audio-animatronic]] version of it appear in [[The Great Movie Ride]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] at [[Walt Disney World]]. The Alien appeared with the attraction's opening in 1989 until the rides closure in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdwinfo.com/wdwinfo/guides/mgm/st-movieride.htm |title=Great Movie Ride - Disney-Hollywood Studios |publisher=Wdwinfo.com |accessdate=2013-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allears.net/tp/mgm/m_movieride.htm |title=Great Movie Ride - Disney's Hollywood Studios |publisher=Allears.net |accessdate=2013-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''Alien''-based attraction at the [[Magic Kingdom]] entered early development stages before being reworked into [[ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The Alien has a brief cameo in an episode of ''[[Zig and Sharko]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMP7KeCsHbw&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Alive''''' is a 1993 American [[biographical film|biographical]] [[survival film|survival]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on [[Piers Paul Read]]'s 1974 book ''[[Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors]]'', which details a Uruguayan rugby team's crash aboard [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]] into the [[Andes|Andes mountains]] on Friday, October 13, 1972.

Filmed on location in the [[Purcell Mountains]] in [[British Columbia]], the film was directed by [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]], written by [[John Patrick Shanley]], and narrated by [[John Malkovich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CE5D71239F936A25752C0A965958260|title=Reviews/Film; Tasteful Cannibalism As Upbeat Viewing|first=Janet|last=Maslin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features an ensemble cast including [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]], [[Vincent Spano]], [[Bruce Ramsay]], [[John Haymes Newton]], [[Illeana Douglas]], and [[Danny Nucci]]. One of the survivors, [[Nando Parrado]] (portrayed by Hawke in the film), served as the technical advisor for the film.

==Plot==
The film opens with a collection of photographs of the [[Stella Maris College (Montevideo)|Stella Maris College]]'s [[Old Christians Club|Old Christians Rugby Team]]. [[Carlitos Páez]] points out several members of the team and reflects on the accident in a brief monologue.

[[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]] flies over the [[Andes]] on October 13, 1972. The raucous rugby players and a few of their relatives and friends are eagerly looking forward to an upcoming match in Chile.

Upon emerging from clouds, the plane encounters turbulence and collides with a mountain. The wings and tail are separated from the fuselage, which slides down a mountain slope before coming to a stop. Six passengers and one flight attendant are ejected from the plane and die. Antonio, the team captain, coordinates efforts to help the injured. [[Roberto Canessa]] and [[Gustavo Zerbino]], both medical students, aid the injured. Another six passengers soon die, including both pilots and Nando's mother, Eugenia. Nando, who sustained a head injury, falls into a coma, and his sister Susana has suffered harsh internal injuries.

As the sun sets, the survivors make preparations for the night. Canessa discovers that the seat covers can be unzipped and used as blankets. The survivors go inside the fuselage and curl up beside one another to stay warm. Antonio, [[Roy Harley]], and Rafael Cano plug the gaping hole at the end of the fuselage with luggage to keep out the wind. Two passengers die overnight. With nothing to hunt or gather on the mountain, Antonio declares they will use rationing when the survivors find a tin of chocolates and a case of wine. After seeing a plane fly past, they think it dips its wing, and the survivors celebrate. Expecting to be rescued the next day, everyone except Javier, his wife Liliana, and Antonio eat the remaining chocolates. This causes a quarrel among Antonio and several others.

Nando regains consciousness. After learning of his mother's death, Nando watches over Susana vigilantly. Knowing she will die of her injuries within a few days, he vows to set off on foot and find a way out of the mountains. When Carlitos reminds him that he will need food, Nando suggests eating the flesh of the deceased pilots to give him the strength to survive the journey to find help. Susana dies from her injuries. The survivors listen to a radio for word of their rescue but are devastated to hear the search called off after nine days.

After great debate, the starving passengers decide to eat the flesh of their dead relatives and friends. Zerbino, Rafael, and Juan Martino set off to search for the tail of the plane in hopes of finding batteries for the plane's radio to transmit their location. Among pieces of the wreckage, the teammates find additional corpses, but return to the group with news that the tail of the plane is likely a little farther away. Later in the week, an avalanche strikes the plane and fills much of the interior with snow. Eight of the survivors are smothered by the snow or freeze to death. A second team, made up of Nando, Canessa, and [[Antonio Vizintin|Antonio "Tintin" Vizintin]], sets out and find the tail of the plane. Unable to bring the batteries to the fuselage, they return to the fuselage to get Roy, who is thought to have experience with electrical equipment. They bring him to the tail of the plane to see whether he can fix the radio. When Roy is unsuccessful, the team returns to the fuselage.

Federico and Alberto die from their injuries, as does Rafael, leading Nando to convince a reluctant Canessa to search for a way out of the mountains, taking Tintin with them. Two days into the journey, they send Tintin back to the fuselage so they can appropriate his rations and continue on their own. After a 12-day trek, the two escape the mountains and alert the authorities of their companions' location. As helicopters land on the mountain, the remaining 14 survivors celebrate.

In the present, Carlitos describes how the survivors later returned to the site of the crash and buried the corpses under a pile of stones, marked with a cross. The memorial to the 29 deceased and 16 survivors is shown.

==Reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 64% of 25 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.3/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1042538-alive/ | title=Alive Movie Reviews - Rotten Tomatoes| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate = 2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' said that, while, "Piers Paul Read's acclaimed book ... paid special attention to the social structure that evolved among the group ... Marshall ... downplays the fascinating sociological details—and the ambiguities of character—in favor of action, heroism and a vague religiosity that's sprinkled over the story like powdered sugar."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/116009 | title=Hot And Cold Survival Skills Newsweek.com | publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' |date= January 18, 1993 | first=David | last=Ansen  | accessdate =2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Ray Green, praised the tactful nature of the film stating that, "despite the potential for lurid sensationalism, Marshall manages to keep his and the film's dignity by steering an effectively downbeat course through some grim goings on thanks in no small manner to the almost allegorical ring of Shanley's stylized dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;Green, Ray. "Alive." ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Box Office]]'' (March 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  Green continues by describing the film as, "thrilling and engrossing as it is at times, ''Alive'' is more than an action film—in its own way it is also a drama of ideas, and of the human spirit as well."

[[Roger Ebert]] wrote "There are some stories you simply can't tell. The story of the Andes survivors may be one of them."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19930115/REVIEWS/301150301/1023 | title=Alive Review | publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |date= January 15, 1993 | first=Roger | last=Ebert  | accessdate =2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also questioned the realism of how normal the actors' bodies looked after portraying two months of near starvation.&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt;

==Documentary==
A companion documentary, ''[[Alive: 20 Years Later]]'', was released at the same time as the film. It includes interviews with the survivors, as well as documentary footage of the rescue. The 30th Anniversary Edition of ''Alive: The Miracle of the Andes'' (on DVD) includes this documentary in the ''Extras'' section.

'''Betty Jane Cornett''' (November 24, 1932 – March 18, 2006) was an [[infielder]] and [[pitcher]] who played in the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]]. Listed at 5' 5", 125&amp;nbsp;lb., she batted and threw right handed.&lt;ref name=AAGPBL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aagpbl.org/index.cfm/profiles/cornett-betty-jane/245 |title= All-American Girls Professional Baseball League official website – Betty Jane Cornett profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary'' – [[W.C.

Born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], Betty Jane Cornett was the youngest of 11 children of Francis T. and Stella ([[née]] Bentz) Cornett.  She attended St. Ambrose, St. Mary's, Latimer and Allegheny high schools. In her spare time, she went to Cowley Recreation Center on [[Troy Hill]] enjoying [[basketball]], [[softball]], swimming and [[ice skating]]. As a teenager, she was a member of the Pittsburgh Rockets basketball team, even though her favorite pastime was playing softball. She joined the league in 1950 with the [[Rockford Peaches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aagpbl.org/index.cfm/teams/1950/rockford-peaches/55 1950 Rockford Peaches]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[spring training]] camp, Rockford decided that Cornett was not ready for the league and sent her to the [[Springfield Sallies]] rookie touring team to acquire more experience. In 1951 she was promoted to the [[Kalamazoo Lassies]] and was dealt to the [[Battle Creek Belles]] before the 1952 season.&lt;ref name=Women&gt;''The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary'' – [[W.C.

Originally an infielder, the Belles turned her into a pitcher for a couple of games with little success, as she posted an 11.26 [[earned run average]] in eight [[innings pitched|innings]] of work. She was best suited for the [[third base]] job, but she hit a paltry .147 [[batting average|average]] in 47 games and Battle Creek did not offer her a contract the next season.&lt;ref name=AAGPBL/&gt;&lt;ref name=Women/&gt;

″Curly″, as her teammates called her for her drooping hair, still wanted to play, so she had to wait five years to regain her amateur status again. Then she played successfully in [[Northwest Ohio]], [[West Virginia]] and [[Pennsylvania]] softball leagues until 1970.&lt;ref name=Women/&gt;

'''''Bionic Commando: Elite Forces''''' is a [[video game]] released in 2000 for the [[Game Boy Color]]. Though the game is part of the ''[[Bionic Commando]]'' series of games by [[Capcom]], ''Elite Forces'' is the only game in the series to be published by [[Nintendo]], and was the first title to be developed by its [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]]-based first-party studio [[Nintendo Software Technology]]. It is the sequel to the [[Game Boy]] version of ''[[Bionic Commando (Game Boy)|Bionic Commando]]'', which launched worldwide in 1992, though it was only ever released in North America and Australia; however, in November 2014, the game launched for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Virtual Console]] service in Europe, again published by Nintendo.

==Gameplay==
{{expand section|date=September 2013}}
Though it borrows some elements from its predecessors, ''Elite Forces'' is different from the rest of the ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic Commando]]'' series; among the changes are a different plot, new moves for the main characters - unnamed female and male commandos - and the ability to utilize a sniper rifle in some segments of the game.

==Plot==
The peaceful land of Karinia is being terrorized by an evil man named Arturus. He is the leader of an evil army called the Avars, who have terrorized Karinia for years. As the Elite Forces fight the Avars, they receive a fragmented communication from Commander Joe (presumably [[Commando (video game)|Super Joe]]), an ally who had infiltrated their territory. Joe's message revealed that Arturus was planning to launch the Albatross Project. After that, communication with Cmdr. Joe was lost. The Bionic Corps contacted the Elite Forces to help stop the Avars, prevent the fall of Karinia, and rescue Joe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4U1U3d5ook | title=Good Game Mondays #15: Bionic Commando Elite Forces GBC | author = MegaScorcher.com | website = [[YouTube]] | publisher = [[Alphabet Inc.]] | date = April 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is essentially a repeat of the events of the 1988 ''[[Bionic Commando (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Bionic Commando]]'', except with a different twist by the end - rather than the resurrection of a long-dead dictator, it is revealed that the Albatross was originally a wrecked space vessel of unknown origin that can give its owner mutant powers.

In [[Chinese alchemy]], elixir poisoning refers to the [[toxicity|toxic effects]] from [[elixir of life|elixirs of immortality]] that contained metals and minerals such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[arsenic]]. The official ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' record numerous [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperors]], [[Chinese nobility|nobles]], and [[scholar-officials|officials]] who died from taking elixirs in order to prolong their lifespans. The first emperor to die from elixir poisoning was likely [[Qin Shi Huang]] (d. 210 BCE) and the last was [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yongzheng]] (d. 1735). Despite common knowledge that immortality potions could be [[metal toxicity|deadly]], [[fangshi]] and [[Daoist]] alchemists continued the elixir-making practice for two millennia.

==Terminology==
The [[etymology]] of English [[elixir]] derives from [[Medieval Latin]] ''[[wikt:elixir#Latin|elixir]]'', from [[Arabic]] [[wikt:إكسير|إكسير]] (''al-ʾiksīr''), probably from [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:ξήριον|ξήριον]] (''xḗrion'' "a desiccative powder for wounds"). ''Elixir'' originated in [[Alchemy#Medieval Europe|medieval European alchemy]] meaning "A preparation by the use of which it was sought to change metals into gold" ([[elixir stone]] or [[philosopher's stone]]) or "A supposed drug or essence with the property of indefinitely prolonging life" ([[elixir of life]]). The word was [[Literal and figurative language|figuratively]] extended to mean "A sovereign remedy for disease. Hence adopted as a name for quack medicines" (e.g., [[Daffy's Elixir]]) and "The quintessence or soul of a thing; its kernel or secret principle". In modern usage, ''elixir'' is a [[pharmacy|pharmaceutical]] term for "A sweetened aromatic solution of alcohol and water, serving as a vehicle for medicine" (''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd ed., 2009). Outside of Chinese cultural contexts, English ''elixir poisoning'' usually refers to accidental contamination, such as the 1937 [[elixir sulfanilamide]] mass poisoning in the United States.

''Dān'' 丹 "cinnabar; vermillion; elixir; alchemy" is the [[Keyword (linguistics)|keyword]] for Chinese immortality elixirs. The red mineral [[cinnabar]] (''dānshā'' 丹砂 lit. "cinnabar sand") was anciently used to produce the pigment [[vermilion]] (''zhūhóng'' 朱紅) and the element [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (''shuǐyín'' 水銀 "watery silver" or ''gǒng'' 汞).

According to the ''ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese'', the [[etymology]] of [[Modern Standard Chinese]] ''dān'' from [[Old Chinese]] ''*tān'' (&lt; *''tlan'' ?) 丹 "red; vermillion; cinnabar", ''gān'' 矸 in ''dāngān'' 丹矸 from *''tân-kân'' (&lt; *''tlan-klan'' ?) "cinnabar; vermillion ore", and ''zhān'' from *''tan'' 旃 "a red flag" derive from [[Kam–Sui languages|Proto-Kam-Sui]] *''h-lan'' "red" or [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Proto-Sino-Tibetan]] *''tja-n'' or *''tya-n'' "red". The *''t-'' initial and *''t-'' or *''k-'' [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] indicate that Old Chinese borrowed this item. (Schuessler 2007: 204).

[[File: 丹-oracle.svg|thumb|[[Oracle script]] for 丹 "cinnabar"]]
Although the word ''dan'' 丹 "cinnabar; red" frequently occurs in [[oracle script]] from the late [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600–1046 BCE) and [[bronzeware script]] and [[seal script]] from the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045–256 BCE), [[Palaeography|paleographers]] disagree about the graphic origins of the [[Chinese character|logograph]] 丹 and its ancient [[variant Chinese character|variants]] 𠁿 and 𠕑. Early scripts combine a 丶 dot or ⼀ stroke (depicting a piece of cinnabar) in the middle of a surrounding frame, which is said to represent: 
*''jǐng'' 井 "well" represents the mine from which the cinnabar is taken" (''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'')
*"the crucible of the Taoist alchemists" ([[Léon Wieger]])
*"the contents of a square receptacle" ([[Bernhard Karlgren]])
*"placed in a tray or palette to be used as red pigment" (Wang Hongyuan 王宏源)
*"mineral powder on a stretched filter-cloth" (Needham and Lu).

Many Chinese elixir names are [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] of ''dan'', such as ''jīndān'' 金丹 (with "gold") meaning "golden elixir; elixir of immortality; [[potable gold]]" and ''xiāndān'' 仙丹 (with "[[Xian (Taoism)|Daoist immortal]]") "elixir of immortality; panacea", and ''shéndān'' 神丹 (with "spirit; god") "divine elixir". ''Bùsǐ zhī yào'' 不死之藥 "drug of deathlessness" was another early name for the elixir of immortality. Chinese alchemists would ''liàndān'' 煉丹 (with "smelt; refine") "concoct pills of immortality" using a ''dāndǐng'' 丹鼎 (with "[[Ding (vessel)|tripod cooking vessel; cauldron]]") "furnace for concocting pills of immortality". In addition, the ancient Chinese believed that other substances provided longevity and immortality, notably the ''[[Lingzhi mushroom|língzhī]]'' 靈芝 "''[[Ganoderma]]'' mushroom".

The transformation from chemistry-based ''[[waidan]]'' 外丹 "external elixir/alchemy" to physiology-based ''[[neidan]]'' 內丹 "internal elixir/alchemy" gave new analogous meanings to old terms. The human body metaphorically becomes a ''[[Ding (vessel)|ding]]'' "cauldron" in which the adept forges the [[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three Treasures]] (essence, life-force, and spirit) within the ''jindan'' Golden Elixir within the ''[[Dantian|dāntián]]'' 丹田 (with "field") "lower part of the abdomen".

In early China, alchemists and pharmacists were one and the same. [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] also used less concentrated cinnabar and mercury preparations, and ''dan'' means "pill; medicine" in general, for example, ''dānfāng'' 丹方 [[semantic change|semantically changed]] from "prescription for elixir of immortality" to "medical prescription". ''Dan'' was [[Lexicalization|lexicalized]] into medical terms such as '' dānjì'' 丹劑 "pill preparation" and ''dānyào'' 丹藥 "pill medicine".

The Chinese names for immortality elixirs have parallels in other cultures and languages, for example, [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Indo-Iranian]] ''[[Soma (drink)|soma]]'' or ''[[haoma]]'', [[Sanskrit]] ''[[amrita]]'', and Greek ''[[ambrosia]]''.

==History==
In [[history of China|Chinese history]], the alchemical practice of concocting elixirs of immortality from metallic and mineral substances began circa the 4th century BCE in the late [[Warring states period]], reached a peak in the 9th century CE [[Tang dynasty]] when five emperors died, and, despite common knowledge of the dangers, elixir poisoning continued until the 18th century [[Qing dynasty]].

===Warring States period===
The earliest mention of alchemy in China occurs in connection with ''[[fangshi]]'' ("masters of the methods") specialists in cosmological and esoteric arts employed by rulers from the 4th century BCE (De Woskin 1981: 19).

The 3rd-century BCE ''[[Zhanguo Ce]]'' and ''[[Han Feizi]]'' both record a story about [[King Qingxiang of Chu]] (r. 298–263 BCE) being presented a ''busi zhi yao'' 不死之藥 "immortality medicine". As the chamberlain was taking the elixir into the palace, a guard asked if it was edible and when he answered yes, the guard grabbed and ate it. The king was angered and condemned the guard to death. A friend of the guard tried to persuade the king, saying, "After all the guard did ask the chamberlain whether it could be eaten before he ate it. Hence the blame attaches to the chamberlain and not to him. Besides what the guest presented was an elixir of life, but if you now execute your servant after eating it, it will be an elixir of death (and the guest will be a liar). Now rather than killing an innocent officer in order to demonstrate a guest's false claim, it would be better to release the guard." This logic convinced the king to let the guard live (Needham and Ho 1970: 316).

===Qin dynasty===
[[Qin Shi Huang]], the founder of the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BCE), feared death and spent the last part of his life seeking the [[Qin Shi Huang#Elixir of life|elixir of life]], and reportedly died from  elixir poisoning (Wright 2001: 49). The first emperor also sent [[Xu Fu]] to sail an expeditionary fleet into the Pacific in order to find the legendary [[Mount Penglai]] where the ''busi zhi shu'' 不死之樹 "tree of deathlessness" grew, but they never returned.

===Han dynasty===
Interest in elixirs of immortality increased during the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD). [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] (156–87 BCE)  employed many ''fangshi'' alchemists who claimed they could produce the legendary substance. The ''[[Book of Han]]'' says that around 133 BCE the ''fangshi'' [[Li Shaojun]] said to Emperor Wu, "Sacrifice to the stove [''zao'' 竈] and you will be able to summon ' things ' [i.e. spirits]. Summon spirits and you will be able to change cinnabar powder into yellow gold. With this yellow gold you may make vessels to eat and drink out of. You will then increase your span of life. Having increased your span of life, you will be able to see the [''xian'' 仙] of [Penglai] that is in the midst of the sea. Then you may perform the sacrifices ''feng'' [封] and ''shan'' [禅], and escape death." (tr. Waley 1930: 2).

[[Wei Boyang]]'s c. 142 ''[[Cantong qi]]'', which is regarded as the oldest complete alchemical book extant in any culture, influenced developments in elixir alchemy. It listed mercury and lead as the prime ingredients for elixirs, which limited later potential experiments and resulted in numerous cases of poisoning. It is quite possible that "many of the most brilliant and creative alchemists fell victim to their own experiments by taking dangerous elixirs" (Needham et al. 1976: 74). There is a famous story about [[animal testing]] of elixirs by Wei Boyang. Wei entered the mountains to prepare the elixir of immortality, accompanied by three disciples, two of whom were skeptical. When the alchemy was completed he said, "Although the gold elixir is now accomplished we ought first to test it by feeding it to a white dog. If the dog can fly after taking it then it is edible for man; if the dog dies then it is not." The dog fell over and died, but Wei and his disciple Yu took the medicine and immediately died, after which the two cautious disciples fled. Wei and Yu later revived, rejoiced in their faith, took more of the elixir and became immortals (Needham and Ho 1970: 322).

Elixir ingestion is first mentioned in the c. 81 BCE ''[[Discourses on Salt and Iron]]'' (Pregadio 2000: 166).

===Six dynasties===
During the turbulent [[Six dynasties]] period (220–589), [[self-experimentation]] with drugs became commonplace, and many people tried taking poisonous elixirs of immortality as well as the [[psychoactive drug]] [[Cold-Food Powder]]. At this time, Daoist alchemists began to record the often fatal side effects of elixirs. In an unusual case of involuntary elixir poisoning, Empress [[Jia Nanfeng]] (257–300) was forced to commit suicide by drinking "jinxiaojiu" 金屑酒 "wine with gold fragments" (Needham and Ho 1970: 326).

The Daoist scholar [[Ge Hong]]'s c. 320 ''[[Baopuzi]]'' lists 56 chemical preparations and elixirs, 8 of which were poisonous, with visions from mercury poisoning the most commonly reported symptom (Needham et al. 1976: 89–96).

The individuals who experimented with Six Dynasties alchemy often had different understandings and intentions. A single alchemical formula could be interpreted as being "suicidal, therapeutic, or symbolic and contemplative", and its implementation might be "a unique, decisive event or a repeated, ritual phantasmagoria" (Strickmann 1979: 192).

[[Emperor Ai of Jin]] (r. 361–365) died at the age of twenty-five, as the result of his desire to avoid growing old. The ''[[Book of Jin]]'' says the emperor practiced ''[[bigu (avoiding grains)|bigu]]'' "grain avoidance" and consumed alchemical elixirs, but was poisoned from an overdose and "no longer knew what was going on around him" (Needham and Ho 1970: 317). In a sardonic sense, the emperor fulfilled his desire since the elixir "did actually prevent him from growing any older" (Ho 2000: 184).

[[Emperor Daowu of Northern Wei|Emperor Daowu]] (r. 371–409), founder of the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty, was cautiously interested in alchemy and used condemned criminals for [[clinical trials]] of immortality elixirs (like [[Mithridates VI of Pontus#Mithridates.27 antidote|Mithridates VI of Pontus]] r. 120–63 BCE) . The ''[[Book of Wei]]'' records that in 400, he instituted the office of the Royal Alchemist, built an imperial laboratory for the preparation of drugs and elixirs, and reserved the Western mountains for the supply of firewood (used in the alchemical furnaces). "Furthermore, he ordered criminals who had been sentenced to death to test (the products) against their will. Many of them died and (the experiments gave) no decisive result." (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 321).

Many texts from the Six dynasties period specifically warned about the toxicity of elixirs. For instance, the [[Shangqing School]] Daoist pharmacologist [[Tao Hongjing]]'s 499 ''[[Zhen'gao]]'' (真誥, Declarations of the Perfected) describes taking a White Powder elixir.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When you have taken a spatulaful of it, you will feel an intense pain in your heart, as if you had been stabbed there with a knife. After three days you will want to drink, and when you have drunk a full ''hu'' [[wikt:斛|斛]] [about 50 liters] your breath will be cut off. When that happens, it will mean that you are dead. When your body has been laid out, it will suddenly disappear, and only your clothing will remain. Thus you will be an immortal released in broad daylight by means of his waistband. If one knows the name of the drug [or, perhaps, the secret names of its ingredients] he will not feel the pain in his heart, but after he has drunk a full ''hu'' he will still die. When he is dead, he will become aware that he has left his corpse below him on the ground. At the proper time, jade youths and maidens will come with an azure carriage to take it away. If one wishes to linger on in the world, he should strictly regulate his drinking during the three days when he feels the pain in his heart. This formula may be used by the whole family. (tr. Strickmann 1979: 137–138) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Within this context, Strickmann says a prospective Daoist alchemist must have been strongly motivated by faith and a firm confidence in his posthumous destiny, in effect, "he would be committing suicide by consecrated means." Tao Hongjing's disciple Zhou Ziliang 周子良 (497–516) had repeated visions of Maoshan divinities who said his destiny was to become an immortal, and instructed him to commit [[ritual suicide]] with a poisonous elixir composed of mushrooms and cinnabar (Strickmann 1994: 40). In 517, Tao edited the ''Zhoushi mingtong ji'' 周氏冥通記 (Records of Mr. Zhou's Communications with the Unseen) detailing his disciples visions.

The [[Liang dynasty]] founder [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] (r. 502–549) was cautious about taking elixirs of immortality. He and Tao Hongjing were old friends, and the ''[[History of the Southern Dynasties]]'' says the emperor requested him to study elixir alchemy. After Tao had learned the secret art of making elixirs, he was worried about the shortage of materials. "So the emperor supplied him with gold, cinnabar, copper sulphate, realgar, and so forth. When the process was accomplished the elixirs had the appearance of frost and snow and really did make the body feel lighter. The emperor took an elixir and found it effective." (tr. Needham et al. 1976: 120). Tao spent his last years working on different elixirs and presented three to the emperor, who had refused immortality elixirs from Deng Yu 鄧郁 (who claimed to have lived 30 years without food, only consuming pieces of mica in stream water).

[[Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi|Emperor Wenxuan]] (r. 550–559) of the [[Northern Qi]] dynasty was an early skeptic about immortality elixirs. He ordered alchemists to make the ''jiuhuan jindan'' 九還金丹 (Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir), which he kept in a jade box, and explained, "I am still too fond of the pleasures of the world to take flight to the heavens immediately—I intend to consume the elixir only when I am about to die." (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 320).

===Tang dynasty===
At least five [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) emperors were incapacitated and killed by immortality elixirs. In the 9th century Tang imperial [[order of succession]], two father-son emperor pairs died from elixirs: first Xianzong (r. 805–820) and Muzong (r. 820–824), then Wuzong (r. 840–846) and Xuanzong (r. 847–859). In [[historic recurrence]]s, the newly enthroned emperor understandably executed the Daoist alchemists whose elixirs had killed his father, and then subsequently came to believe in other charlatans enough to consume their poisonous elixirs (Ho 2000: 184).

[[Emperor Xianzong of Tang|Emperor Xianzong]] (r. 805–820) indirectly lost his life due to elixir poisoning. The ''Xu Tongzhi'' (Supplement to the Historical Collections) says, "Deluded by the sayings of the alchemists, [Xianzong] ingested gold elixirs and his behaviour became very abnormal. He was easily offended by those officials whom he daily met, and thus the prisons were left with little vacant space." (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 317). In response, an official wrote an 819 [[memorial to the throne]] that said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Of late years, however, (the capital) has been overrun by a host of pharmacists and alchemists ... recommending one another right and left with ever wilder and more extravagant claims. Now if there really were immortals, and scholars possessing the Tao, would they not conceal their names and hide themselves in mountain recesses far from the ken of man? ... The medicines of the sages of old were meant to cure bodily illnesses, and were not meant to be taken constantly like food. How much less so these metallic and mineral substances which are full of burning poison! ... Of old, as the ''[[Book of Rites|Li Chi]]'' says, when the prince took physic, his minister tasted it first, and when a parent was sick, his son did likewise. Ministers and sons are in the same position. I humbly pray that all those persons who have elixirs made from transformed metals and minerals, and also those who recommend them, may be compelled to consume (their own elixirs) first for the space of one year. Such an investigation will distinguish truth from falsehood, and automatically clarify the matter by experiment. (abridged, tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 318) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
After the emperor rejected this appeal, the palace [[eunuchs]] [[Wang Shoucheng]] and Chen Hongzhi 陳弘志 assassinated him in 820.

When Xianzong's son and successor [[Emperor Muzong of Tang|Emperor Muzong]] (r. 820–824) came to the throne, he executed the alchemists who had poisoned his father, but later began to take immortality elixirs himself. An official wrote Muzong an 823 memorial that warned:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Medicines are for use against illnesses, and should not be taken as food. … Even when one is ill medicines must be used with great circumspection; how much more so when one is not ill. If this is true for the common people how much more so will it be for the emperor! Your imperial predecessor believed the nonsense of the alchemists and thus became ill; this your majesty already knows only too well. How could your majesty still repeat the same mistake? (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 319) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The emperor appreciated this reasoning but soon afterwards fell ill and died from poisoning. Palace eunuchs supposedly used poisonous elixirs to assassinate Muzong's young successor [[Emperor Jingzong of Tang|Emperor Jingzong]] (r. 824–827) (Needham et al. 1976: 151, 182).

The next Tang emperor to die from elixir poisoning was [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Wuzong]] (r. 840–846). According to the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', "The emperor [Wuzong] favoured alchemists, took some of their elixirs, cultivated the arts of longevity and personally accepted (Taoist) talismans. The medicines made him very irritable, losing all normal self-control in joy or anger; finally when his illness took a turn for the worse he could not speak for ten days at a time." [[Chancellor of the Tang dynasty|Chancellor]] [[Li Deyu]] and others requested audiences with the emperor, but he refused and subsequently died in 846 (Needham and Ho 1970: 319).

Wuzong's successor [[Emperor Xuānzong of Tang|Emperor Xuānzong]] (r. 846–849) astonishingly also died of elixir poisoning. Xuānzong made himself the patron of some Daoists who concocted immortality elixirs of vegetable origin, possibly because his father Wuzong had died from metallic and mineral elixir poisoning (Needham et al. 1976: 146). The ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' records that the emperor received a wine tincture of ivy (常春藤, ''[[Hedera helix]]'') that the Daoist adept Jiang Lu 姜攎 claimed would turn white hair black and provide longevity. However, when the emperor heard that many people died a violent death after drinking ivy tincture, he stopped taking it. Jiang was publicly shamed and the emperor granted his request to search in the mountains for the right plant, but he never appeared again (Needham et al. 1976: 147). According to the 890 ''Dongguan zuoji'' (Record of Memorials from the Eastern Library), "A medical official, Li [Xuanbo], presented to the emperor [Xuanzong] cinnabar which had been heated and subdued by fire, in order to gain favour from him. Thus the ulcerous disease of the emperor was all attributable to his crime." (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 319).

Besides emperors, many Tang [[Scholar-official|literati]] were interested in alchemy. Both [[Li Bai]] (Waley 1950: 55–56) and [[Bai Juyi]] (Ho, Goh, and Parker 1974) wrote poems about the ''Cantong qi'' and alchemical elixirs. Other poets, including [[Meng Haoran]], [[Liu Yuxi]], and [[Liu Zongyuan]] also referred to elixir compounding in their works (Pregadio 2000: 171).

The influential Tang physician and alchemist [[Sun Simiao]]'s c. 640 alchemical ''Taiqing zhenren dadan'' 太清真人大丹 (Great Purity Essentials of Elixir Manuals for Oral Transmission) recommends 14 elixir formulas he found successful, most of which seem poisonous, containing mercury and lead, if not arsenic, as ingredients (Needham et al. 1976: 133). Sun's medical c. 659 ''Qianjin yifang'' 千金要方 (Supplement to the Thousand Golden Remedies) categorically states that mercury, realgar, orpiment, sulphur, gold, silver, and vitriol are poisonous, but prescribed them in much larger amounts for elixirs than for medicines. In contrast to drinking soluble arsenic (as in [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|groundwater]]), when powdered arsenic is eaten "astonishing degrees of tolerance can be achieved", and Sun Simiao might have thought that when human beings reached to a level "approaching that of the immortals their bodies would no longer be susceptible to poison" (Needham et al. 1976: 135).

Tang alchemists were well aware of elixir poisoning. The c. 8th–9th century ''Zhenyuan miaodao yaolüe'' 真元妙道要略 (Synopsis of the Essentials of the Mysterious Dao of the True Origin) lists 35 common mistakes in elixir preparation: cases where people died from eating elixirs made from cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver; cases where people suffered from boils on the head and sores on the back by ingesting cinnabar prepared by roasting together mercury and sulphur, and cases where people became seriously ill through drinking melted "liquid lead" (Needham and Ho 1970: 330). The c. 850 ''Xuanjie lu'' 玄解錄 (Record of Mysterious Antidotes)—which is notable as the world's oldest printed book on a scientific subject—recommends a potent herbal composition that serves both as an elixir and as an antidote for common elixir poisoning (Needham and Ho 1970: 335). The procedure to make ''Shouxian wuzi wan'' 守仙五子丸 (Five-herbs Immortality-safeguarding Pills) is to take 5 ounces each of [[Phyllanthus emblica|Indian gooseberry]], [[Rubus coreanus|wild raspberry]], [[Cuscuta japonica|dodder]], [[Schisandra chinensis|five-flavor berry]], and [[Plantago major|broadleaf plantain]] and pound them into flour. Mix it with [[Lycium chinense|boxthorn]] juice and [[Eclipta prostrata|false daisy]] juice and dry. Heat almonds and good wine in a silver vessel, and add ''[[Rehmannia glutinosa|foxglove]]'', tofu, and "deer glue". Combine this with the five herbs, and dry into small pills. The usual dosage is 30 pills a day taken with wine, but one should avoid eating pork, garlic, mustard, and turnips when taking the medicine (Needham and Ho 1970: 335).

During the Tang period, Chinese alchemists divided into two schools of thought about elixir poisoning. The first altogether ignored the poison danger and considered the unpleasant symptoms after taking an elixir as signs of its efficacy. The c. 6th century ''Taiqing shibi ji'' 太清石壁記 (Records of the Rock Chamber) described away the side effects and recommended methods of bringing relief. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;After taking an elixir, if your face and body itch as though insects were crawling over them, if your hands and feet swell dropsically, if you cannot stand the smell of food and bring it up after you have eaten it, if you feel as though you were going to be sick most of the time, if you experience weakness in the four limbs, if you have to go often to the latrine, or if your head or stomach violently ache—do not be alarmed or disturbed. All these effects are merely proofs that the elixir you are taking is successfully dispelling your latent disorders. (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 283) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many of these symptoms are characteristic of metallic poisoning: [[formication]], [[edema]], and weakness of the extremities, later leading to infected boils and ulcers, nausea, vomiting, gastric and abdominal pain, diarrhea, and headaches (Needham and Lu 1974: 283). For relieving the side-effects when the elixir takes effect, the ''Taiqing shibi ji'' recommends that one should take hot and cold baths, and drink a mixture of scallion, soy sauce, and wine. If that does not bring relief, then one should combine and boil a hornets' nest, [[spurge]], [[Polygonatum|Solomon's seal]], and [[ephedra]] into a medicine and take one dose (Needham and Ho 1970: 331).

The second school of alchemists, admitted that some metal and mineral elixir constituents were poisonous and tried either to neutralize them or to replace them with less dangerous herbal substances (Needham et al. 1976: 182). For instance, the 8th-century ''Zhang zhenren jinshi lingsha lun'' 張真人金石靈沙論 (The Adept Zhang's Discourse on Metals, Minerals, and Cinnabar) emphasized the poisonous nature of gold, silver, lead, mercury, and arsenic, and described witnessing many cases of premature death brought about by consuming cinnabar. Zhang believed however that the poisons could be rendered harmless by properly choosing and combining [[adjuvant]] and complimentary ingredients; for example gold should always be used together with mercury, while silver can only be used when combined with gold, [[Basic copper carbonate|copper carbonate]], and realgar for the preparation of the ''jindan'' Golden Elixir (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 331). Many Tang alchemical writers returned to the fashion of using obscure synonyms for ingredients, perhaps because of the alarming number of elixir poisonings, and the desire to dissuade amateur alchemists from experimenting on themselves (Needham et al. 1976: 138). By the end of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), the more cautious alchemists had generally changed the elixirs ingredients from minerals and metals to plants and animals (Ho and Lisowski 1997: 39).

The late Tang or early Song ''Huangdi jiuding shendan jingjue'' 黄帝九鼎神丹經訣 (Explanation of the Yellow Emperor's Manual of the Nine-Vessel Magical Elixir) says, "The ancient masters (lit. sages) all attained longevity and preserved their lives (lit. bones) by consuming elixirs. But later disciples (lit. scholars) have suffered loss of life and decay of their bones as the result of taking them." The treatise explains the secret ancient methods for rendering elixir ingredients harmless by treating them with wine made from ''[[Vitex negundo|chastetree]]'' leaves and roots, or with [[saltpeter]] and vinegar. Another method of supposedly removing the poison from mercury was to put it in three-year-old wine, add [[sal ammoniac]] and boil it for 100 days (Needham and Ho 1970: 332–3).

===Five dynasties===
Two rulers died from elixir poisoning during the [[Five Dynasties]] period (907–979) of political turmoil after the overthrow of the Tang dynasty. [[Zhu Wen]] or Emperor Taizu (r. 907–912), the founder of the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang dynasty]], became seriously incapacitated as a result of elixir poisoning, and fell victim to an assassination plot. [[Li Bian]] or Emperor Liezu (r. 937–943), the founder of the [[Southern Tang]] kingdom, took immortality elixirs that made him irritable and deathly ill (Needham et al. 1976: 180).

The Daoist adept [[Chen Tuan]] (d. 989) advised two emperors that they should not worry about elixirs but direct their minds to improving the state administration, [[Chai Rong]] or Emperor Shizong of [[Later Zhou]] in 956, and then [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] in 976 (Needham et al. 1976: 194).

===Song dynasty===
After its heyday in the Tang dynasty Daoist alchemy continued to flourish during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) period. However, since six Tang emperors and many court officials died from elixir poisoning, Song alchemists exercised more caution, not only in the composition of the elixirs themselves, but also in attempts to find pharmaceutical methods of counteracting the toxic effects. The number of ingredients used in elixir formulas was reduced and there was a tendency to return to the ancient and difficult terminology of the ''Cantongqi'', perhaps to conceal the processes from rash and ignorant operators. Psycho-physiological ''neidan'' alchemy became steadily more popular than laboratory ''waidan'' alchemy (Needham et al. 1976: 208).

During the Song dynasty, the practice of consuming metallic elixirs was not confined to the imperial court and expanded to anyone wealthy enough to pay. The author and official [[Ye Mengde]] (1077–1148) described how two of his friends had died from elixirs of immortality in one decade. First, Lin Yanzhen, who boasted about his health and muscular strength, took an elixir for three years, "Whereupon ulcers developed in his chest, first near the hairs as large as rice-grains, then after a couple of days his neck swelled up so that chin and chest seemed continuous." Lin died after ten months of suffering, and his doctors discovered cinnabar powder had accumulated in his pus and blood. Second, whenever Xie Renbo "heard of anyone who had some cinnabar subdued by fire he went after it, caring nothing about the distance, and his only fear was that he would not have enough." He also developed ulcers on the chest. Although his friends noticed changes in his appearance and behavior, Xie did not recognize that he had been poisoned, "till suddenly it came upon him like a storm of wind and rain, and he died in a single night." (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 320)

The scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]]'s 1088 ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' suggested that mercury compounds might be medicinally valuable and needed further study—foreshadowing the use of metallic compounds in modern medicine, such as mercury in [[salvarsan]] for [[syphilis]] or [[antimony]] for [[visceral leishmaniasis]]. Shen says his cousin once transformed cinnabar into an elixir, but one of his students mistakenly ate a leftover piece, became delirious, and died the next day.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now cinnabar is an extremely good drug and can be taken even by a newborn baby, but once it has been changed by heat it can kill an (adult) person. If we consider the change and transformation of opposites into one another, since (cinnabar) can be changed into a deadly poison why should it not also be changed into something of extreme benefit? Since it can change into something which kills, there is good reason to believe that it may have the pattern-principle [''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]]''] of saving life; it is simply that we have not yet found out the art (of doing this). Thus we cannot deny the possibility of the existence of methods for transforming people into feathered immortals, but we have to be very careful about what we do. (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 327). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Su Shi]] (1037–1101), the Song dynasty scholar and pharmacologist, was familiar with the life-prolonging claims of alchemists, but wrote in a letter that, "I have recently received some cinnabar (elixir) which shows a most remarkable colour, but I cannot summon up enough courage to try it." (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 320).

The [[forensic medicine|forensic medical]] expert [[Song Ci]] was familiar with the effects of metal poisoning, and his c. 1235 ''[[Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified]]'' handbook for [[coroners]] gives a test for mercury poisoning: plunge a piece of gold into the intestine or tissues and see if a superficial [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] forms. He also describes the colic, cramps, and discharge of blood from arsenic poisoning, and gives several antidotes including emetics.

===Ming dynasty===
[[File:Chinese woodcut; Daoist internal alchemy (9) Wellcome L0038979.jpg|thumb|[[Woodblock printing#Early printed books in China and Korea|Chinese woodblock]] illustration of a ''[[neidan]]'' practice "Putting the miraculous elixir into the ''ding'' tripod", 1615 ''Xingming guizhi'' 性命圭旨 (Pointers on Spiritual Nature and Bodily Life)]]
[[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) authorities strongly disapproved of immortality elixirs, but the [[Jiajing Emperor]] (r. 1521–1567) supposedly died from consuming them. The emperor was interested in the art of immortality and put great confidence in Daoist physicians, magicians, and alchemists. One named Wang Jin 王金, who was appointed a Physician-in-Attendance in the Imperial Academy of Medicine, convinced the emperor that eating and drinking from vessels made of alchemical gold and silver would bring about immortality, but it only resulted in his death. Wang fled but was caught and exiled to the frontiers in 1570 (Needham et al. 1976: 212).

[[Li Shizhen]]'s classic 1578 ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'' discusses the historical tradition of producing gold and cinnabar elixirs, and concludes, "(the alchemists) will never realise that the human body, which thrives on water and the cereals, is unable to sustain such heavy substances as gold and other minerals within the stomach and intestines for any length of time. How blind it is, in the pursuit of longevity, to lose one's life instead!" (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 325–326). In another section, Li criticizes alchemists and pharmacologists for perpetuating the belief in mercury elixirs.
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not able to tell the number of people who since the Six Dynasties period (3rd to 6th centuries) so coveted life that they took (mercury), but all that happened was that they impaired their health permanently or lost their lives. I need not bother to mention the alchemists, but I cannot bear to see these false statements made in pharmacopoeias. However, while mercury is not to be taken orally, its use as a medicine must not be ignored. (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 325–326) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Qing dynasty===
The [[Qing dynasty]] [[Yongzheng Emperor]] (r. 1722–1735) was the last Chinese ruler known to die from elixir poisoning. He was a superstitious man, affected by portents and omens, and a firm believer in Daoist longevity techniques. Taking immortality elixirs is thought to have caused his sudden death in 1735 (Zelin 2002: 229).

===Historical interpretations===
The Chinese tradition of using toxic [[heavy metals]] in elixirs of immortality has historical parallels in [[Ayurvedic medicine]]. [[Rasa shastra]] is the practice of adding metals and minerals to herbal medicines, [[rasayana]] is an alchemical tradition that used mercury and cinnabar for lengthening lifespan, [[raseśvara]] is a tradition that advocated the use of mercury to make the body immortal, and [[Samskara (ayurvedic)|samskara]] is a process said to detoxify heavy metals and toxic herbs.

The [[History of science and technology in China|historians of Chinese science]] [[Joseph Needham]] and Ho Peng-Yoke wrote a seminal article about poisonous alchemical elixirs (1959, 1970). Based upon early Chinese descriptions of elixir poisoning, they decisively demonstrated a close correspondence with the known medical symptoms of [[mercury poisoning]], [[lead poisoning]], and [[arsenic poisoning]]. Compare the historical descriptions of Jin Emperor Ai (d. 365) who "no longer knew what was going on around him" and Tang Emperor Wuzong (d. 846) who was "very irritable, losing all normal self-control in joy or anger ... he could not speak for ten days at a time" with the distinctive psychological effects of mercury poisoning: progressing from "abnormal irritability to idiotic, melancholic, or manic conditions" (1970: 327). Needham and his collaborators further discussed elixir poisoning in the ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' series, particularly Needham and [[Lu Gwei-djen]] (1974), and Needham, Ho, and Lu (1976).

Although Chinese elixir poisoning may lead some to dismiss Chinese alchemy as another example of human follies in history, Ho Peng-Yoke and F. Peter Lisowski note its positive aspect upon Chinese medicine. The caution given to elixir poisoning later led Chinese alchemy to "shade imperceptibly" into [[iatrochemistry]], the preparation of medicine by chemical methods, "in other words [[chemotherapy]]" (1997: 39).

A recent study found that Chinese emperors lived comparatively short lives, with a mean age at death of emperors at 41.3, which was significantly lower than that of [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] at 66.9 and [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese doctors]] at 75.1. Causes of imperial death were natural disease (66.4%), homicide (28.2%), drug toxicity (3.3%), and suicide (2.1%). Homicide resulted in a significantly lower age of death (mean age 31.1) than disease (45.6), suicide (38.8), or drug toxicity (43.1, mentioning Qin Shi Huang taking mercury pills of immortality). Lifestyles seem to have been a determining factor, and 93.2% of the emperors studied were overindulgent in drinking alcohol, sexual activity, or both (Zhao et al. 2006: 1295). The study does not refer to the Chinese belief that the arsenic sulphides realgar and orpiment, frequently used in immortality elixirs, had aphrodisiac properties (Needham and Lu 1974: 285).

==Hypothetical explanations==
A significant question remains unanswered. If the insidious dangers of alchemical elixir poisoning were common knowledge, why did people continue to consume them for centuries? Joseph Needham and his collaborators suggested three hypothetical explanations, and Michel Strickmann proposed another.

===Initial exhilaration===
Needham and Lu's first explanation is that many alchemical mineral preparations were capable of giving an "initial exhilaration" or transient sense of well-being, usually involving [[weight loss]] and [[aphrodisiac|increased libido]]. These preliminary tonic effects could have acted as a kind of "bait" inveigling an elixir-taker deeper into [[substance intoxication]], even to the point of death (1974: 282). Chinese medical texts recorded that [[realgar]] (arsenic disulphide) and [[orpiment]] (arsenic trisulphide) were aphrodisiacs and stimulated fertility, while cinnabar and sulphur elixirs increased longevity, averted hunger, and "lightened the body" (namely, ''qīngshēn'' 輕身, which is a common description of elixir effects) (1974: 285).

Wine, as mentioned above, was both prescribed to be drunk when taking elixir pills and to relieve the unpleasant side-effects of elixir poisoning. Needham and Lu further suggest the possibility that elixir alchemy included [[hallucinogenic drug]]s, tentatively identifying the ''busi zhi yao'' 不死之藥 "drug of deathlessness" as [[Amanita muscaria|fly-agaric]] and ''busi zhi shu'' 不死之樹 "tree of deathlessness" as [[birch]] (1974: 117). The elixir that Tao Hongjing's disciple Zhou Ziliang took to commit suicide "probably had hallucinogenic and toxic mushrooms" (1974: 296). In the present day, [[realgar wine]] is traditionally consumed as part of the [[Dragon Boat Festival]].

===Incorruptibility===
[[File:Si lü yu yi.JPG|thumb|[[Jade burial suit]] of [[Nanyue]] King [[Zhao Mo]] (d. 122 BCE)]]
[[File:Xin Zhui 3.JPG|thumb|The preserved body of [[Xin Zhui]] (d. 163 BCE)]]
The apparent [[incorruptibility]] of an elixir-taker's corpse is Needham and Lu's second explanation for the persistent belief in immortality elixirs. They suggest that in some cases a body did not decompose because the deceased had died from mercury or arsenic poisoning, which is [[forensic medicine|forensically]] known to often preserve a corpse from decay. For a believer in Daoist immortality drugs, even when an elixir-taker had unmistakably died, if the corpse was comparatively undecomposed, that could be interpreted as proof that the adept had become a ''xian'' immortal, as well as evidence for the alchemical elixir's efficacy. (1974: 298).

Terminal incorruptibility was an ancient Chinese belief associated with jade, gold, and cinnabar. The ''[[Baopuzi]]'' says, "When gold and jade are inserted into the nine orifices, corpses do not decay. When salt and brine are absorbed into flesh and marrow, dried meats do not spoil. So when men ingest substances which are able to benefit their bodies and lengthen their days, why should it be strange that (some of these) should confer life perpetual?" The abolition of decay was believed to demonstrate the power of elixirs, "the corruptible had put on incorruptibility" (Needham and Lu 1974: 284). Chinese [[jade burial suit]]s are a better known example of using a mineral to preserve corpses.

There is a possibility that Sun Simiao (above) died from taking mercury elixirs (Needham and Ho 1970: 330). According to Sun's hagiography in the 10th-century ''Xuxian zhuan'' 續仙傳 (Further Biographies of the Immortals), after his death in 682 there was no visible sign of putrefaction, "After more than a month had passed there was no change in his appearance, and when the corpse was raised to be placed in the coffin it was as light as (a bundle of) empty clothes." (tr. Needham and Lu 1974:298).

The incorruptibility stories about elixir users were not all myth, and recent archeological evidence showed that the ancient Chinese knew how "to achieve an almost perpetual conservation". The 1972 excavation of a tomb at [[Mawangdui]] discovered the extremely well-preserved body of [[Xin Zhui]] or Lady Dai, which resembled that of "a person who had died only a week or two before" (Needham and Lu 1974: 303–304). A subsequent autopsy on her corpse found "abnormally high levels" of mercury and lead in her internal organs (Brown 2002: 213).

===Temporary death===
Needham and Lu's third justification for taking poisonous elixirs is a drug-induced "temporary death", possibly a trance or coma. In the classic legend (above) about Wei Boyang drinking an elixir of immortality, he appears to die, subsequently revives, and takes more elixir to achieve immortality.

The ''[[Baopuzi]]'' describes a [[Cold-Food Powder#Six Dynasties|Five Mineral]]-based multicolored Ninefold Radiance Elixir that can bring a corpse back to life: "If you wish to raise a body that has not been dead for fully three days, bathe the corpse with a solution of one spatula of the blue elixir, open its mouth, and insert another spatula full; it will revive immediately." (tr. Ware 1966:82).

A Tang Daoist text prescribes taking an elixir in doses half the size of a millet grain, but adds, "If one is sincerely determined, and dares to take a whole spatula-full all at once, one will temporarily die [''zànsǐ'' 暫死] for half a day or so, and then be restored to life like someone waking from sleep. This however is perilous in the extreme." (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 295).

===Ritual suicide===
Michel Strickmann, a scholar of Daoist and Buddhist studies, analyzed the well-documented [[Shangqing School]]'s alchemy in the [[Maoshan]] revelations and in the life of Tao Hongjing, and concluded that scholars need to reexamine the Western stereotype of "accidental elixir poisoning" that supposedly applied to "misguided alchemists and their unwitting imperial patrons". Since Six Dynasties and Tang period Daoist literature thoroughly, "even rapturously", described the deadly toxic qualities of many elixirs, and Strickmann proposed that some of the recorded alchemical deaths were intentional [[ritual suicide]] (1979: 191). Two reviewers disagreed about Strickmann's conclusions. The first questions why he defends the logic of alchemical suicide rather than simply accepting the idea of accidental elixir poisoning, and says Tao Hongjing never experimented with alchemy seriously enough to achieve suicide himself—but fails to mention Strickmann's prime example: Tao's disciple Zhou Ziliang whom Shangqing deities reportedly instructed to prepare a poisonous elixir and commit suicide in order to achieve immortality (Chen 1981: 547). The second describes Strickmann's chapter as "one of the most thorough and useful" in the volume, and says he proves that it is "almost ludicrous to assume that a Taoist (commoner or emperor) could have died from ''accidental'' elixir poisoning" (Cass 1982: 92–93).

'''Chip budding''' is a [[grafting]] technique.

A chip of wood containing a [[bud]] is cut out of scion with desirable properties (tasty fruit, pretty flowers, etc.). A similarly shaped chip is cut out of the [[rootstock]], and the scion bud is placed in the cut, in such a way that the [[cambium]] layers match. The new bud is usually fixed in place using grafting tape.&lt;ref name="rhs"&gt;https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=400&lt;/ref&gt;

Chip budding can be done in mid- to late summer, unlike most grafting which takes place in the early spring.&lt;ref name="rhs" /&gt; Depending on sap flow, the bud may not begin growing until the following spring, though you can determine if the grafting succeeded before that by seeing whether the bud swells or shrivels.&lt;ref&gt;https://simpson.ca.uky.edu/files/reproducing_fruit_trees_by_graftage_budding_and_grafting.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The next spring, all other shots than that from the scion bud are removed, which will then become the source for the new top of the plant.

'''Computational creativity''' (also known as '''artificial creativity''', '''mechanical creativity''', '''creative computing''' or '''creative computation''') is a multidisciplinary endeavour that is located at the intersection of the fields of [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[the arts]].

The goal of computational creativity is to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one of several ends:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* To construct a [[computer program|program]] or [[computer]] capable of human-level [[creativity]].
* To better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans.
* To design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves.

The field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity. Theoretical work on the nature and proper definition of creativity is performed in parallel with practical work on the implementation of systems that exhibit creativity, with one strand of work informing the other.

==Theoretical issues==
As measured by the amount of activity in the field (e.g., publications, conferences and workshops), computational creativity is a growing area of research.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} But the field is still hampered by a number of fundamental problems. Creativity is very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to define in objective terms.  Is it a state of mind, a talent or ability, or a process?   Creativity takes many forms in human activity, some ''eminent'' (sometimes referred to as "Creativity" with a capital C) and some ''mundane''.

These are problems that complicate the study of creativity in general, but certain problems attach themselves specifically to ''computational'' creativity:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* Can creativity be hard-wired? In existing systems to which creativity is attributed, is the creativity that of the system or that of the system's programmer or designer?
* How do we evaluate computational creativity? What counts as creativity in a computational system? Are [[natural language generation]] systems creative? Are [[machine translation]] systems creative? What distinguishes research in computational creativity from research in [[artificial intelligence]] generally?
* If eminent creativity is about rule-breaking or the disavowal of convention, how is it possible for an algorithmic system to be creative? In essence, this is a variant of [[Ada Lovelace]]'s objection to machine intelligence, as recapitulated by modern theorists such as Teresa Amabile.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The social psychology of creativity|first = Teresa|last = Amabile|year = 1983|publisher = New York, NY: Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a machine can do only what it was programmed to do, how can its behavior ever be called ''creative''?

Indeed, not all computer theorists would agree with the premise that computers can only do what they are programmed to do&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Why programming is a good medium for expressing poorly understood and sloppily formulated ideas|first=Marvin|last=Minsky|booktitle=Design and Planning II-Computers in Design and Communication|year=1967|pages=120–125|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7511/307c10790f077e66844efd1e37e4f084dd1b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a key point in favor of computational creativity.

==Defining creativity in computational terms==

Because no single perspective or definition seems to offer a complete picture of creativity, the AI researchers Newell, Shaw and Simon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The process of creative thinking  | first = Shaw, J. G., and Simon, Herbert A.  |last =  Newell, Allen | year = 1963 | publisher =  H. E. Gruber, G. Terrell and M. Wertheimer (Eds.), Contemporary Approaches to Creative Thinking, pp 63 – 119. New York: Atherton }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the combination of novelty and usefulness into the cornerstone of a multi-pronged view of creativity, one that uses the following four criteria to categorize a given answer or solution as creative:

# The answer is novel and useful (either for the individual or for society)
# The answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted
# The answer results from intense motivation and persistence
# The answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague

Whereas the above reflects a "top-down" approach to computational creativity, an alternative thread has developed among "bottom-up" computational psychologists involved in artificial neural network research. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, such generative neural systems were driven by [[genetic algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, P. M. (1991) [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/140338/ NEUROGEN, musical composition using genetic algorithms and cooperating neural networks], Second International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks: 309-313.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments involving recurrent nets&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Todd | first1 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = A connectionist approach to algorithmic composition | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 27–43 | doi=10.2307/3679551}}&lt;/ref&gt; were successful in hybridizing simple musical melodies and predicting listener expectations.

Concurrent with such research, a number of computational psychologists took the perspective, popularized by [[Stephen Wolfram]], that system behaviors perceived as complex, including the mind's creative output, could arise from what would be considered simple algorithms. As neuro-philosophical thinking matured, it also became evident that language actually presented an obstacle to producing a scientific model of cognition, creative or not, since it carried with it so many unscientific aggrandizements that were more uplifting than accurate. Thus questions naturally arose as to how "rich," "complex," and "wonderful" creative cognition actually was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thaler | first1 = S. L. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging intelligence and its critical look at us | url = http://newdualism.org/nde-papers/Thaler/Thaler-Journal%20of%20Near-Death%20Studies_1998-17-21-29.pdf | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 21–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial neural networks==

Before 1989, [[artificial neural network]]s have been used to model certain aspects of creativity. Peter Todd (1989) first trained a neural network to reproduce musical melodies from a training set of musical pieces. Then he used a change algorithm to modify the network's input parameters.  The network was able to randomly generate new music in a highly uncontrolled manner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bharucha | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Todd | first2 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 44–53 | doi=10.2307/3679552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M., and Loy, D.G. (Eds.) (1991). Music and connectionism. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, Todd&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M. (1992). A connectionist system for exploring melody space. In Proceedings of the 1992 International Computer Music Conference (pp. 65-68). San Francisco: International Computer Music Association.&lt;/ref&gt;
extended this work, using the so-called distal teacher approach that had been developed by
Paul Munro,&lt;ref&gt;A dual backpropagation scheme for scalar-reward learning. P Munro - Ninth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Werbos]],&lt;ref&gt;Neural networks for control and system identification. PJ Werbos - Decision and Control, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  D. Nguyen and [[Bernard Widrow]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee373b/truckbackerupper.pdf The truck backer-upper: An example of self-learning in neural networks]. D Nguyen, B Widrow -  IJCNN'89, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Michael I. Jordan]] and [[David Rumelhart]].&lt;ref&gt;Forward models: Supervised learning with a distal teacher. MI Jordan, DE Rumelhart - Cognitive Science, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In the new approach there are two neural networks, one of which is supplying training patterns to another. 
In later efforts by Todd, a composer would select a set of melodies that define the melody space, position them on a 2-d plane with a mouse-based graphic interface, and train a connectionist network to produce those melodies, and listen to the new "interpolated" melodies that the network generates corresponding to intermediate points in the 2-d plane.

More recently a neurodynamical model of [[semantic network]]s has been developed to study how the connectivity structure of these networks relates to the richness of the semantic constructs, or ideas, they can generate. It was demonstrated that [[semantic neural network]]s  that have richer semantic dynamics than those with other connectivity structures may provide insight into the important issue of how the physical structure of the brain determines one of the most profound features of the human mind – its capacity for creative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Marupaka, Nagendra, and Ali A. Minai. "Connectivity and creativity in semantic neural networks." Neural Networks (IJCNN), The 2011 International Joint Conference on. IEEE, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key concepts from the literature==
Some high-level and philosophical themes recur throughout the field of computational creativity.{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}

===Important categories of creativity===
Margaret Boden&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Creative Mind: Myths and Mechanisms  | first = Margaret  |last =  Boden | year = 1990 | publisher = London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Computational models of creativity. | first = Margaret |last = Boden | year = 1999 | publisher = Handbook of Creativity, pp 351&amp;ndash;373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  refers to creativity that is novel ''merely to the agent that produces it'' as "P-creativity" (or "psychological creativity"), and refers to creativity that is recognized as novel ''by society at large'' as "H-creativity" (or "historical creativity"). Stephen Thaler has suggested a new category he calls "V-" or "Visceral creativity" wherein significance is invented to raw sensory inputs to a Creativity Machine architecture, with the "gateway" nets perturbed to produce alternative interpretations, and downstream nets shifting such interpretations to fit the overarching context. An important variety of such V-creativity is consciousness itself, wherein meaning is reflexively invented to activation turnover within the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creative computing|url=http://www.apaonline.org/404.asp?aspxerrorpath=/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx#Thaler|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=16 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115232433/http://www.apaonline.org/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx|archivedate=15 November 2012|location=Wayback machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploratory and transformational creativity===
Boden also distinguishes between the creativity that arises from an exploration within an established conceptual space, and the creativity that arises from a deliberate transformation or transcendence of this space. She labels the former as ''exploratory creativity'' and the latter as ''transformational creativity'', seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical, challenging, and rarer than the former. Following the criteria from Newell and Simon elaborated above, we can see that both forms of creativity should produce results that are appreciably novel and useful (criterion 1), but exploratory creativity is more likely to arise from a thorough and persistent search of a well-understood space (criterion 3) -- while transformational creativity should involve the rejection of some of the constraints that define this space (criterion 2) or some of the assumptions that define the problem itself (criterion 4).  Boden's insights have guided work in computational creativity at a very general level, providing more an inspirational touchstone for development work than a technical framework of algorithmic substance. However, Boden's insights are more recently also the subject of formalization, most notably in the work by Geraint Wiggins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Preliminary Framework for Description, Analysis and Comparison of Creative Systems | first = Geraint   |last =  Wiggins | year = 2006 | publisher = Journal of Knowledge Based Systems 19(7), pp. 449-458  |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.581.5208&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generation and evaluation===
The criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases, generation and evaluation. In the first phase, novel (to the system itself, thus P-Creative)  constructs are generated; unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage. This body of potentially creative constructs are then evaluated, to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not. This two-phase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke, Ward and Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creative cognition: Theory, research and applications | first =  Ward, T., and Smith, S. |last = Finke, R.  | year = 1992 | publisher = Cambridge: MIT press.|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/oldmodelling/hi/theses/paulness/appendixd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity.

===Combinatorial creativity===
A great deal, perhaps all, of human creativity can be understood as a novel combination of pre-existing ideas or objects {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Common strategies for combinatorial creativity include:
*Placing a familiar object in an unfamiliar setting (e.g., [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'') or an unfamiliar object in a familiar setting (e.g., a fish-out-of-water story such as ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'')
*Blending two superficially different objects or genres (e.g., a sci-fi story set in the Wild West, with robot cowboys, as in ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'', or the reverse, as in ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''; Japanese [[haiku]] poems, etc.)
*Comparing a familiar object to a superficially unrelated and semantically distant concept (e.g., "Makeup is the Western [[Burqa|burka]]"; "A [[zoo]] is a gallery with living exhibits")
*Adding a new and unexpected feature to an existing concept (e.g., adding a [[scalpel]] to a [[Swiss Army knife]]; adding a [[camera phone|camera]] to a [[mobile phone]])
*Compressing two incongruous scenarios into the same narrative to get a joke (e.g., the [[Emo Philips]] joke "Women are always using me to advance their careers. Damned anthropologists!")
*Using an iconic image from one domain in a domain for an unrelated or incongruous idea or product (e.g., using the [[Marlboro Man]] image to sell cars, or to advertise the dangers of smoking-related impotence).
The combinatorial perspective allows us to model creativity as a search process through the space of possible combinations. The combinations can arise from composition or concatenation of different representations, or through a rule-based or stochastic transformation of initial and intermediate representations. [[Genetic algorithm]]s and [[neural network]]s can be used to generate blended or crossover representations that capture a combination of different inputs.

====Conceptual blending====
{{Main article|Conceptual blending}}
Mark Turner and Gilles Fauconnier&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Way We Think|first =  Turner, Mark|last =  Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Conceptual Integration Networks|first =Turner, Mark|last =Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Cognitive Science, 22(2) pp 133–187  }}&lt;/ref&gt; propose a model called Conceptual Integration Networks that elaborates upon [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ideas about [[The Act of Creation|creativity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title={The act of creation}|last=Koestler|first=Arthur|year=1964|publisher=London: Hutchinson, and New York: Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more recent work by Lakoff and Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|title=Metaphors we live by
|last=Lakoff
|first=George

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; by synthesizing ideas from Cognitive Linguistic research into [[mental space]]s and [[conceptual metaphors]]. Their basic model defines an integration network as four connected spaces:

*A first input space (contains one conceptual structure or mental space)
*A second input space (to be blended with the first input)
*A ''generic space'' of stock conventions and image-schemas that allow the input spaces to be understood from an integrated perspective
*A ''blend space'' in which a selected projection of elements from both input spaces are combined; inferences arising from this combination also reside here, sometimes leading to emergent structures that conflict with the inputs.

Fauconnier and Turner describe a collection of optimality principles that are claimed to guide the construction of a well-formed integration network. In essence, they see blending as a compression mechanism in which two or more input structures are compressed into a single blend structure. This compression operates on the level of conceptual relations.  For example, a series of similarity relations between the input spaces can be compressed into a single identity relationship in the blend.

Some computational success has been achieved with the blending model by extending pre-existing computational models of analogical mapping that are compatible by virtue of their emphasis on connected semantic structures.&lt;ref name="Veale2007"&gt;{{citation|title = Computation and Blending  | first = O'Donoghue, Diarmuid  |last = Veale, Tony  | year = 2007 | publisher =  Cognitive Linguistics, 11(3-4), special issue on Conceptual Blending }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Francisco Câmara Pereira&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creativity and Artificial Intelligence: A Conceptual Blending Approach | first = Francisco Câmara  |last = Pereira  | year = 2006 | url=http://eden.dei.uc.pt/~camara/AICreativity | publisher =  Applications of Cognitive Linguistics. Amsterdam: Mouton de Gruyter }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented an implementation of blending theory that employs ideas both from [[GOFAI]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to realize some aspects of blending theory in a practical form; his example domains range from the linguistic to the visual, and the latter most notably includes the creation of mythical monsters by combining 3-D graphical models.

==Linguistic creativity==
Language provides continuous opportunity for creativity, evident in the generation of novel sentences, phrasings, [[pun]]s, [[neologism]]s, [[rhyme]]s, [[allusion]]s, [[sarcasm]], [[irony]], [[simile]]s, [[metaphor]]s, [[analogy|analogies]], [[witticism]]s, and [[joke]]s. Native speakers of morphologically rich languages  frequently create new [[Word form|word-forms]] that are easily understood, although they will never find their way to the dictionary. The area of [[natural language generation]] has been well studied, but these creative aspects of everyday language have yet to be incorporated with any robustness or scale.

===Story generation===
Substantial work has been conducted in this area of linguistic creation since the 1970s, with the development of James Meehan's TALE-SPIN
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=TALE-SPIN|first=James|last=Meehan|year=1981|publisher=Shank, R. C. and Riesbeck, C. K., (eds.), ''Inside Computer Understanding: Five Programs plus Miniatures''. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system. TALE-SPIN viewed stories as narrative descriptions of a problem-solving effort, and created stories by first establishing a goal for the story's characters so that their search for a solution could be tracked and recorded. The MINSTREL&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Creative Process: A Computer Model of Storytelling|first = S.R.|last=Turner|year=1994|publisher =Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system represents a complex elaboration of this basis approach, distinguishing a range of character-level goals in the story from a range of author-level goals for the story. Systems like Bringsjord's BRUTUS&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity. Inside the Mind of BRUTUS, a Storytelling Machine.   | first = Ferrucci, D. A.  |last =  Bringsjord, S. | year = 2000 | publisher = Hillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates }}&lt;/ref&gt; elaborate these ideas further to create stories with complex inter-personal themes like betrayal. Nonetheless, MINSTREL explicitly models the creative process with a set of Transform Recall Adapt Methods (TRAMs) to create novel scenes from old. The MEXICA&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = MEXICA: A computer model of a cognitive account of creative writing  | first = Sharples, Mike  |last = Pérez y Pérez, Rafael  | year = 2001 | publisher =  Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 13, pp 119-139 |url=http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~dan/673/papers/perezyperez.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; model of Rafael Pérez y Pérez and Mike Sharples is more explicitly interested in the creative process of storytelling, and implements a version of the engagement-reflection cognitive model of creative writing.

The company [[Narrative Science]] makes computer generated news and reports commercially available, including summarizing team sporting events based on statistical data from the game.  It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103192105/http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |archivedate=2011-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphor and simile===
Example of a metaphor: ''"She was an ape."''

Example of a simile: ''"Felt like a tiger-fur blanket.''"
The computational study of these phenomena has mainly focused on interpretation as a knowledge-based process. Computationalists such as [[Yorick Wilks]], James Martin,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Computational Model of Metaphor Interpretation | first =  James |last =  Martin | year = 1990 | publisher =  Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Fass, John Barnden,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Belief in Metaphor: Taking Commonsense Psychology Seriously  | first =  John  |last = Barnden  | year = 1992 | publisher =   Computational Intelligence 8, pp 520-552}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Lee have developed knowledge-based approaches to the processing of metaphors, either at a linguistic level or a logical level. Tony Veale and Yanfen Hao have developed a system, called Sardonicus, that acquires a comprehensive database of explicit similes from the web; these similes are then tagged as bona-fide (e.g., "as hard as steel") or ironic (e.g., "as hairy as a [[bowling ball]]", "as pleasant as a [[endodontic therapy|root canal]]"); similes of either type can be retrieved on demand for any given adjective. They use these similes as the basis of an on-line metaphor generation system called Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Comprehending and Generating Apt Metaphors: A Web-driven, Case-based Approach to Figurative Language|first=Hao, Yanfen|last=Veale, Tony|year=2007|publisher=Proceedings of AAAI 2007, the 22nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vancouver, Canada|url=http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-233.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can suggest lexical metaphors for a given descriptive goal (e.g., to describe a supermodel as skinny, the source terms "pencil", "whip", "[[whippet]]", "rope", "[[Phasmatodea|stick-insect]]" and "snake" are suggested).

===Analogy===
The process of analogical reasoning has been studied from both a mapping and a retrieval perspective, the latter being key to the generation of novel analogies. The dominant school of research, as advanced by [[Dedre Gentner]], views analogy as a structure-preserving process; this view has been implemented in the [[structure mapping engine]] or SME,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The structure-mapping engine: Algorithm and examples | first = Forbus, Ken and Gentner, Dedre  |last =  Falkenhainer, Brian | year = 1989 | url = http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/papers/Files/smeff2(searchable).pdf| publisher =   Artificial Intelligence, 20(41) pp 1–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MAC/FAC retrieval engine (Many Are Called, Few Are Chosen), ACME ([[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]]) and ARCS ([[Analogical Retrieval Constraint System]]). Other mapping-based approaches include Sapper,&lt;ref name="Veale2007" /&gt; which situates the mapping process in a semantic-network model of memory. Analogy is a very active sub-area of creative computation and creative cognition; active figures in this sub-area include [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Paul Thagard]], and [[Keith Holyoak]]. Also worthy of note here is Peter Turney and Michael Littman's [[machine learning]] approach to the solving of [[SAT]]-style analogy problems; their approach achieves a score that compares well with average scores achieved by humans on these tests.

===Joke generation===
{{main article|Computational humor}}

Humour is an especially knowledge-hungry process, and the most successful joke-generation systems to date have focussed on pun-generation, as exemplified by the work of Kim Binsted and Graeme Ritchie.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Children's evaluation of computer-generated punning riddles|first=Pain, H., and Ritchie, G.|last=Binsted, K.|year=1997|publisher=''Pragmatics and Cognition'', 5(2), pp 309&amp;ndash;358|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Helen_Pain/publication/2337083_Children%27s_Evaluation_of_Computer--Generated_Punning_Riddles/links/0fcfd5100419c21c7c000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work includes the [[JAPE (software)|JAPE]] system, which can generate a wide range of puns that are consistently evaluated as novel and humorous by young children. An improved version of JAPE has been developed in the guise of the STANDUP system, which has been experimentally deployed as a means of enhancing linguistic interaction with children with communication disabilities. Some limited progress has been made in generating humour that involves other aspects of natural language, such as the deliberate misunderstanding of pronominal reference (in the work of Hans Wim Tinholt and Anton Nijholt), as well as in the generation of humorous acronyms in the HAHAcronym system&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=HAHAcronym: Humorous agents for humorous acronyms|first=Strapparava, Carlo|last=Stock, Oliviero|year=2003|publisher=Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 16(3) pp 297–314|url=https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/5127042/twlt20.pdf#page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Oliviero Stock and Carlo Strapparava.

===Neologism===
The blending of multiple word forms is a dominant force for new word creation in language; these new words are commonly called "blends" or "[[portmanteau word]]s" (after [[Lewis Carroll]]). Tony Veale has developed a system called ZeitGeist&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Tracking the Lexical Zeitgeist with Wikipedia and WordNet | first = Tony  |last = Veale  | year = 2006 | publisher =Proceedings of ECAI'2006, the 17th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; that harvests neological [[headword]]s from [[Wikipedia]] and interprets them relative to their local context in Wikipedia and relative to specific word senses in [[WordNet]]. ZeitGeist has been extended to generate neologisms of its own; the approach combines elements from an inventory of word parts that are harvested from WordNet, and simultaneously determines likely glosses for these new words (e.g., "food traveller" for "gastronaut" and "time traveller" for "[[wikt:chrononaut|chrononaut]]"). It then uses [[Web search]] to determine which glosses are meaningful and which neologisms have not been used before; this search identifies the subset of generated words that are both novel ("H-creative") and useful. [[Neurolinguistics|Neurolinguistic]] inspirations have been used to analyze the process of novel word creation in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Creativity and the Brain, In: A Handbook of Creativity for Teachers. Ed. Ai-Girl Tan|first=Wlodzislaw|last=Duch|year=2007|publisher=World Scientific Publishing, Singapore, pp 507–530|url=http://cogprints.org/5356/1/06-Creativity-Brain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; understand neurocognitive processes responsible for intuition, insight, imagination and creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Intuition, Insight, Imagination and Creativity|first=Wlodzislaw|last=Duch|year=2007|publisher=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 2(3) pp 40–52|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duch_Wlodzislaw/publication/3455552_Intuition_Insight_Imagination_and_Creativity/links/0046352b15de1ce647000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to create a server that invents novel names for products, based on their description.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Experiments with computational creativity|first=Duch Wlodzislaw|last=Pilichowski Maciej|year=2007|publisher=Neural Information Processing – Letters and Reviews, 11(4-6) pp 123-133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the system Nehovah&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Nehovah: A Neologism Creator Nomen Ipsum|first=Hintze, R. S., and Ventura, D.|last=Smith, M. R.|year=2014|publisher=Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC 2014), pp 173-181 | url = http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/06//10.1_Smith.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; blends two source words into a neologism that blends the meanings of the two source words. Nehovah searches WordNet for synonyms and TheTopTens.com for pop culture hyponyms. The synonyms and hyponyms are blended together to create a set of candidate neologisms. The neologisms are then scored based on their word structure, how unique the word is, how apparent the concepts are conveyed, and if the neologism has a pop culture reference. Nehovah loosely follows conceptual blending.

===Poetry===
&lt;div style="float:right; border:1px solid gray; padding:5px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; text-align:right; background:lightyellow"&gt;
More than iron, more than lead, more than gold I need electricity.&lt;br&gt;I need it more than I need lamb or pork or lettuce or cucumber.&lt;br&gt;I need it for my dreams.
&lt;small&gt;Racter, from ''The Policeman's Beard Is Half Constructed''&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Like jokes, poems involve a complex interaction of different constraints, and no general-purpose poem generator adequately combines the meaning, phrasing, structure and rhyme aspects of poetry. Nonetheless, Pablo Gervás&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = An expert system for the composition of formal Spanish poetry|first=Pablo|last=Gervás|year=2001|publisher=Journal of Knowledge-Based Systems 14(3-4) pp 181&amp;ndash;188|url=http://nil.fdi.ucm.es/sites/default/files/gervasjkbs2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a [[case-based reasoning]] (CBR) approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a case-base of existing poems. Each poem fragment in the ASPERA case-base is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment, and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment. [[Meter (poetry)|Metrical]] rules are then used to combine these fragments into a well-formed poetic structure. [[Racter]] is an example of such a software project.

==Musical creativity==
Computational creativity in the music domain has focused both on the generation of musical scores for use by human musicians, and on the generation of music for performance by computers. The domain of generation has included classical music (with software that generates music in the style of [[Mozart]] and [[Bach]]) and [[jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A Functional Taxonomy of Music Generation Systems

EMI's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human-generated to a high level of competence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ Triumph of the Cyborg Composer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226121804/http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ |date=February 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of contemporary classical music, [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] is the first computer that composes from scratch, and produces final scores that professional interpreters can play. The [[London Symphony Orchestra]] played a piece for full orchestra, included in [[Iamus (album)|Iamus' debut CD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Iamus' debut CD|year = 2012|publisher = Melomics Records}}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv4y_BRJokM&amp;feature=relmfu]&lt;/ref&gt; which ''[[New Scientist]]'' described as "The first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Computer composer honours Turing's centenary| journal= New Scientist| date =5 July 2012| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melomics]], the technology behind Iamus, is able to generate pieces in different styles of music with a similar level of quality.

Creativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and the cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent: reasoning about time, remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played, and planning ahead for what might be played next.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  The robot Shimon, developed by Gil Weinberg of Georgia Tech, has demonstrated jazz improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121763193|title=A Robot Named Shimon Wants To Jam With You|date=22 December 2009|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual improvisation software based on machine learning models of musical style include OMax, SoMax and PyOracle, are used to create improvisations in real-time by re-injecting variable length sequences learned on the fly from live performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1 = Shlomo | last1 = Dubnov | first2 = Greg | last2 = Surges | title = Delegating Creativity: Use of Musical Algorithms in Machine Listening and Composition | publisher = Newton Lee (Ed.), Digital Da Vinci, Springer | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a Creativity Machine architecture (see above) was able to generate 11,000 musical hooks by training a synaptically perturbed neural net on 100 melodies that had appeared on the top ten list over the last 30 years. In 1996, a self-bootstrapping Creativity Machine observed audience facial expressions through an advanced machine vision system and perfected its musical talents to generate an album entitled "Song of the Neurons"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagination-engines.com/iei_son.php|title=Song of the Neurons|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of musical composition, the patented works&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Article de presse : [http://www.realcomposer.com/Medal%20-%20RevuePresse.htm « Génération automatique d'œuvres numériques », article sur l'invention Medal de Béatrice Perret du Cray] », ''[[Science et Vie Micro]]''&lt;/ref&gt; by [[René-Louis Baron]] allowed to make a robot that can create and play a multitude of orchestrated melodies so-called "coherent" in any musical style. All outdoor physical parameter associated with one or more specific musical parameters, can influence and develop each of these songs (in real time while listening to the song). The patented invention ''[[René-Louis Baron#Inventor.27s path|Medal-Composer]]'' raises problems of copyright.

==Visual and artistic creativity==
Computational creativity in the generation of visual art has had some notable successes in the creation of both abstract art and representational art. The most famous program in this domain is [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]'s [[AARON]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Aaron's Code.|first = Pamela|last=McCorduck|author-link=Pamela McCorduck|year=1991|publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been continuously developed and augmented since 1973. Though formulaic, Aaron exhibits a range of outputs, generating black-and-white drawings or colour paintings that incorporate human figures (such as dancers), potted plants, rocks, and other elements of background imagery. These images are of a sufficiently high quality to be displayed in reputable galleries.

Other software artists of note include the NEvAr system (for "[[neuroevolution|Neuro-Evolutionary]] Art") of Penousal Machado.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Art of Artificial Evolution: A Handbook on Evolutionary Art and Music|first= Machado, Penousal (eds.)|last=Romero, Juan|year = 2008|publisher =  Natural Computing Series. Berlin: Springer Verlag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypdCBD6JrAsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEvAr uses a genetic algorithm to derive a mathematical function that is then used to generate a coloured three-dimensional surface. A human user is allowed to select the best pictures after each phase of the genetic algorithm, and these preferences are used to guide successive phases, thereby pushing NEvAr's search into pockets of the search space that are considered most appealing to the user.

[[The Painting Fool]], developed by [[Simon Colton]] originated as a system for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting styles, colour palettes and brush types. Given its dependence on an input source image to work with, the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool raised questions about the extent of, or lack of, creativity in a computational art system. Nonetheless, in more recent work, The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images, much as [[AARON]] does, from its own limited imagination. Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests, which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user (e.g., these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more color-saturated, while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller). Artistically, the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron, though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former (constraint satisfaction, etc.) may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter.

The artist Krasimira Dimtchevska and the software developer Svillen Ranev have created a computational system combining a rule-based generator of English sentences and a visual composition builder that converts sentences generated by the system into abstract art.&lt;ref&gt;"Methods, systems and software for generating sentences, and visual and audio compositions representing said sentences" Canadian Patent 2704163&lt;/ref&gt; The software generates automatically indefinite number of different images using different color, shape and size palettes. The software also allows the user to select the subject of the generated sentences or/and the one or more of the palettes used by the visual composition builder.

An emerging area of computational creativity is that of video games. ANGELINA is a system for creatively developing video games in Java by Michael Cook.

In July 2015 [[Google]] released ''[[DeepDream]]'' – an [[Open-source software|open source]]&lt;ref name=github&gt;{{Github|google/deepdream}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer vision program, created to detect faces and other patterns in images with the aim of automatically classifying images, which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic [[pareidolia]], thus creating a dreamlike [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christian |last1=Szegedy  |first2=Wei |last2=Liu |first3=Yangqing |last3=Jia|first4=Pierre |last4=Sermanet|first5=Scott |last5=Reed|first6=Dragomir |last6=Anguelov|first7=Dumitru |last7=Erhan|first8=Vincent |last8=Vanhoucke|first9=Andrew |last9=Rabinovich|title = Going Deeper with Convolutions|journal= Computing Research Repository|year=2014 |arxiv= 1409.4842|bibcode=2014arXiv1409.4842S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=codexample&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708233542/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|archivedate=2015-07-08|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|title=DeepDream - a code example for visualizing Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 researchers from [[Tübingen, Germany]] created a convolutional neural network that uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images which is able to turn images into stylistic imitations of works of art by artists such as a [[Picasso]] or [[Van Gogh]] in about an hour. Their algorithm is put into use in the website [[DeepArt]] that allows users to create unique artistic images by their algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McFarland|first1=Matt|title=This algorithm can create a new Van Gogh or Picasso in just an hour|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/08/31/this-algorithm-can-create-a-new-van-gogh-or-picasso-in-just-an-hour/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Culpan|first1=Daniel|title=This algorithm can create an imitation Van Gogh in 60 minutes|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/01/art-algorithm-recreates-paintings|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GitXiv - A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|url=http://gitxiv.com/posts/jG46ukGod8R7Rdtud/a-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style|website=gitxiv.com|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Gatys|first1=Leon A.|last2=Ecker|first2=Alexander S.|last3=Bethge|first3=Matthias|title=A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|arxiv=1508.06576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, a global team of researchers explained how a new computational creativity approach known as the Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate (DSNS) could be used to generate original chess puzzles that were not derived from endgame databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Iqbal |first1=Azlan |last2=Guid  |first2=Matej |last3=Colton |first3=Simon |last4=Krivec |first4=Jana |last5=Azman |first5=Shazril |last6=Haghighi |first6=Boshra |series=SpringerBriefs in Cognitive Computation |title=The Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate: A New Approach to Computational Creativity |publisher=Springer |location=Switzerland |date=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-28078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSNS is able to combine features of different objects (e.g. chess problems, paintings, music) using stochastic methods in order to derive new feature specifications which can be used to generate objects in any of the original domains. The generated chess puzzles have also been featured on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvub4ug2bM9nlx7VbF5nWhw Chesthetica's YouTube Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creativity in problem solving==
Creativity is also useful in allowing for unusual solutions in [[problem solving]]. In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], this research area is called [[creative problem solving]]. The Explicit-Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity has recently been implemented using a [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION]]-based computational model that allows for the simulation of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]] in problem solving.&lt;ref name ="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Helie | first1 = S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis of this computational creativity project is not on performance per se (as in [[artificial intelligence]] projects) but rather on the explanation of the psychological processes leading to human creativity and the reproduction of data collected in psychology experiments. So far, this project has been successful in providing an explanation for incubation effects in simple memory experiments, insight in problem solving, and reproducing the overshadowing effect in problem solving.

==Debate about "general" theories of creativity==

Some researchers feel that creativity is a complex phenomenon whose study is further complicated by the plasticity of the language we use to describe it. We can describe not just the agent of creativity as "creative" but also the product and the method. Consequently, it could be claimed that it is unrealistic to speak of a ''general theory of creativity''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Nonetheless, some generative principles are more general than others, leading some advocates to claim that certain computational approaches are "general theories". Stephen Thaler, for instance, proposes that certain modalities of neural networks are generative enough, and general enough, to manifest a high degree of creative capabilities. Likewise, the Formal Theory of Creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990-2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a simple computational principle published by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J. 1991"&gt;Schmidhuber, J. (1991), [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/170605/ Curious model-building control systems]. In Proc. ICANN, Singapore, volume 2, pp 1458-1463. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory postulates that creativity and [[curiosity]] and [[selective attention]] in general are by-products of a simple [[algorithm]]ic principle for measuring and [[optimizing]] learning progress.

==Criticism of Computational Creativity==
{{Weasel|reason=Broad claims are made which contradict much of the rest of this article, without specific attribution|date=December 2018}}

Traditional computers, as mainly used in the computational creativity application, do not support creativity, as they fundamentally transform a set of discrete, limited domain of input parameters into a set of discrete, limited domain of output parameters using a limited set of computational functions  {{Citation needed|reason=This does not seem to line up with current approaches in generative AI. What does "limited set of computational functions" mean?|date=November 2018}}. As such, a computer cannot be creative, as everything in the output must have been already present in the input data or the algorithms {{Citation needed|reason=This seems like an opinion, one that uses a very specific definition of creativity, a very narrow definition of "traditional computer", and a fairly fundamental misunderstanding of how generative models actually work|date=November 2018}}. For some related discussions and references to related work are captured in some recent work on philosophical foundations of simulation&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, A. (2013). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31140-6_1 Truth, Trust, and Turing–Implications for Modeling and Simulation]. In: Ontology, Epistemology, and Teleology for Modeling and Simulation, pp. 1-26. Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mathematically, the same set of arguments against creativity has been made by Chaitin&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin, G. J. (1987). Algorithmic information theory. Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Similar observations come from a Model Theory perspective. All this criticism emphasizes that computational creativity is useful and may look like creativity, but it is not real creativity, as nothing new is created, just transformed in well defined algorithms.

[[Nucleotide]]s (bases) are matched to synthesize the new partner strands into two new double helices.]]
In [[molecular biology]], '''DNA replication''' is the [[biological process]] of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original [[DNA]] molecule. This process occurs in all [[life|living organisms]] and is the basis for [[heredity|biological inheritance]]. The cell possesses the distinctive property of division, which makes replication of DNA essential.

DNA is made up of a [[nucleic acid double helix|double helix]] of two [[Complementary DNA|complementary]] [[DNA strand|strands]]. During replication, these strands are separated.  Each strand of the original DNA molecule then serves as a template for the production of its counterpart, a process referred to as [[semiconservative replication]]. As a result of semi-conservative replication, the new helix will be composed of an original DNA strand as well as a newly synthesized strand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/Semi-Conservative-DNA-Replication-Meselson-and-Stahl-421|title=Semi-Conservative DNA Replication; Meselson and Stahl|last=Pray|first=Leslie A.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellular [[Proofreading (Biology)|proofreading]] and [[Error checking|error-checking]] mechanisms ensure near perfect [[fidelity]] for DNA replication.&lt;ref name="Berg"&gt;Imperfect DNA replication results in [[mutation]]s. {{cite book |vauthors=Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L, Clarke ND |title=Biochemistry |year=2002 |chapter=[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fc,kgi?rid=stryer.chapter.3740 Chapter 27: DNA Replication, Recombination, and Repair] |publisher=W.H.

In a [[cell (biology)|cell]], DNA replication begins at specific locations, or [[origin of replication|origins of replication]], in the [[genome]].&lt;ref name="origins"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L, Clarke ND | title=Biochemistry| year=2002 | chapter=[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bofghoks/bv.fcvbngi?rid=stayer.section.3794 Chapter 27, Section 4: DNA Replication of Both Strands Proceeds Rapidly from Specific Start Sites] | publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company| isbn=0-7167-3051-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unwinding of DNA at the origin and synthesis of new strands, accommodated by an enzyme known as helicase, results in [[replication fork]]s growing bi-directionally from the origin. A number of [[protein]]s are associated with the replication fork to help in the initiation and continuation of [[DNA synthesis]]. Most prominently, [[DNA polymerase]] synthesizes the new strands by adding [[nucleotide]]s that complement each (template) strand. DNA  replication occurs during the S-stage of [[interphase]].

DNA replication (DNA amplification) can also be performed ''[[in vitro]]'' (artificially, outside a cell). DNA polymerases isolated from cells and artificial DNA primers can be used to initiate DNA synthesis at known sequences in a template DNA molecule. [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[ligase chain reaction]] (LCR), and [[transcription-mediated amplification]] (TMA) are examples.

==DNA structure==
DNA exists as a double-stranded structure, with both strands coiled together to form the characteristic [[double-helix]]. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of [[nucleotide]]s. Nucleotides in DNA contain a [[deoxyribose]] sugar, a [[phosphate]], and a [[nucleobase]]. The four types of [[nucleotide]] correspond to the four [[nucleobase]]s [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], and [[thymine]], commonly abbreviated as A, C, G and T. Adenine and guanine are [[purine]] bases, while cytosine and thymine are [[pyrimidine]]s. These nucleotides form [[phosphodiester bonds]], creating the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone of the DNA double helix with the nucleobases pointing inward (i.e., toward the opposing strand). Nucleobases are matched between strands through [[hydrogen bonding|hydrogen bonds]] to form [[base pair]]s. Adenine pairs with thymine (two hydrogen bonds), and guanine pairs with cytosine (three hydrogen bonds).

[[Directionality (molecular biology)|DNA strands have a directionality]], and the different ends of a single strand are called the "3' (three-prime) end" and the "5' (five-prime) end". By convention, if the base sequence of a single strand of DNA is given, the left end of the sequence is the 5' end, while the right end of the sequence is the 3' end. The strands of the double helix are anti-parallel with one being 5' to 3', and the opposite strand 3' to 5'. These terms refer to the carbon atom in deoxyribose to which the next phosphate in the chain attaches. Directionality has consequences in DNA synthesis, because DNA polymerase can synthesize DNA in only one direction by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of a DNA strand.

The pairing of complementary bases in DNA (through [[hydrogen bonding]]) means that the information contained within each strand is useless. phosphoodiester (intra-strand) bonds are stronger than hydrogen (inter-strand) bonds.  This allows the strands to be separated from one another.  The nucleotides on a single strand can therefore  be used to reconstruct nucleotides on a newly synthesized partner strand.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts, B., et al., ''Molecular Biology of the Cell,'' Garland Science, 4th ed., 2002, pp. 238–240 {{ISBN|0-8153-3218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA polymerase==
{{Main article|DNA polymerase}}

[[Image:DNA polymerase.svg|thumb|250px|right| DNA polymerases adds nucleotides to the 3' end of a strand of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Lizabeth A. ''Fundamental Molecular Biology''. Blackwell Publishing. 2007. p.112 {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0379-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a mismatch is accidentally incorporated, the polymerase is inhibited from further extension. Proofreading removes the mismatched nucleotide and extension continues.]]

[[DNA polymerase]]s are a family of [[enzyme]]s that carry out all forms of DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L, Clarke ND | title=Biochemistry| year=2002| publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company| isbn=0-7167-3051-0}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=stryer.section.3769 Chapter 27, Section 2: DNA Polymerases Require a Template and a Primer]&lt;/ref&gt;  DNA polymerases in general cannot initiate synthesis of new strands, but can only extend an existing DNA or RNA strand paired with a template strand. To begin synthesis, a short fragment of RNA, called a [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]], must be created and paired with the template DNA strand.

DNA polymerase adds a new strand of DNA by extending the 3' end of an existing nucleotide chain, adding new [[nucleotide]]s matched to the template strand one at a time via the creation of [[phosphodiester bond]]s. The energy for this process of DNA polymerization comes from hydrolysis of the [[high-energy phosphate]] (phosphoanhydride) bonds between the three phosphates attached to each unincorporated [[nucleotide|base]].  Free bases with their attached phosphate groups are called [[nucleotide]]s; in particular, bases with three attached phosphate groups are called [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. When a nucleotide is being added to a growing DNA strand, the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the proximal phosphate of the nucleotide to the growing chain is accompanied by hydrolysis of a high-energy phosphate bond with release of the two distal phosphates as a [[pyrophosphate]]. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the resulting pyrophosphate into inorganic phosphate consumes a second high-energy phosphate bond and renders the reaction effectively irreversible.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The [[energetics]] of this process may also help explain the directionality of synthesis—if DNA were synthesized in the 3' to 5' direction, the energy for the process would come from the 5' end of the growing strand rather than from free nucleotides. The problem is that if the high energy triphosphates were on the growing strand and not on the free nucleotides, proof-reading by removing a mismatched terminal nucleotide would be problematic: Once a nucleotide is added, the triphosphate is lost and a single phosphate remains on the backbone between the new nucleotide and the rest of the strand. If the added nucleotide were mismatched, removal would result in a DNA strand terminated by a monophosphate at the end of the "growing strand" rather than a high energy triphosphate. So strand would be stuck and wouldn't be able to grow anymore. In actuality, the high energy triphosphates hydrolyzed at each step originate from the free nucleotides, not the polymerized strand, so this issue does not exist.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, DNA polymerases are highly accurate, with an intrinsic error rate of less than one mistake for every 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; nucleotides added.&lt;ref name="pmid18166979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCulloch|first1=Scott D|last2=Kunkel|first2=Thomas A|title=The fidelity of DNA synthesis by eukaryotic replicative and translesion synthesis polymerases|journal=Cell Research|date=January 2008|volume=18|issue=1|pages=148–161|doi=10.1038/cr.2008.4|pmid=18166979|pmc=3639319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, some DNA polymerases also have proofreading ability; they can remove nucleotides from the end of a growing strand in order to correct mismatched bases. Finally, post-replication mismatch repair mechanisms monitor the DNA for errors, being capable of distinguishing mismatches in the newly synthesized DNA strand from the original strand sequence. Together, these three discrimination steps enable replication fidelity of less than one mistake for every 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; nucleotides added.&lt;ref name="pmid18166979"/&gt;

The rate of DNA replication in a living cell was first measured as the rate of phage T4 DNA elongation in phage-infected ''E. coli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCarthy|first1=David|last2=Minner|first2=Charles|last3=Bernstein|first3=Harris|last4=Bernstein|first4=Carol|title=DNA elongation rates and growing point distributions of wild-type phage T4 and a DNA-delay amber mutant|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=October 1976|volume=106|issue=4|pages=963–981|doi=10.1016/0022-2836(76)90346-6|pmid=789903}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37&amp;nbsp;°C, the rate was 749 nucleotides per second.

General Features of Chromosomal Replication: Three Common Features of Replication Origins]&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the origin has been located, these initiators recruit other proteins and form the [[pre-replication complex]], which unwinds the double-stranded DNA.

===Elongation===
DNA polymerase has 5′–3′ activity.
All known DNA replication systems require a free 3' [[hydroxyl]] group before synthesis can be initiated (note: the DNA template is read in 3′ to 5′ direction whereas a new strand is synthesized in the 5′ to 3′ direction—this is often confused). Four distinct mechanisms for DNA synthesis are recognized:
#All cellular life forms and many DNA [[virus]]es, [[phage]]s and [[plasmid]]s use a [[primase]] to synthesize a short RNA primer with a free 3′ OH group which is subsequently elongated by a DNA polymerase.  
#The retroelements (including [[retrovirus]]es) employ a transfer RNA that primes DNA replication by providing a free 3′ OH that is used for elongation by the [[reverse transcriptase]]. 
#In the [[adenovirus]]es and the φ29 family of [[bacteriophage]]s, the 3' OH group is provided by the side chain of an amino acid of the genome attached protein (the terminal protein) to which nucleotides are added by the DNA polymerase to form a new strand.  
#In the single stranded DNA viruses—a group that includes the [[circovirus]]es, the [[geminivirus]]es, the [[parvovirus]]es and others—and also the many phages and [[plasmid]]s that use the rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism, the RCR endonuclease creates a nick in the genome strand (single stranded viruses) or one of the DNA strands (plasmids). The 5′ end of the nicked strand is transferred to a [[tyrosine]] residue on the nuclease and the free 3′ OH group is then used by the DNA polymerase to synthesize the new strand.

The first is the best known of these mechanisms and is used by the cellular organisms. In this mechanism, once the two strands are separated, [[primase]] adds RNA primers to the template strands. The leading strand receives one RNA primer while the lagging strand receives several. The leading strand is continuously extended from the primer by a DNA polymerase with high [[processivity]], while the lagging strand is extended discontinuously from each primer forming [[Okazaki fragments]]. [[RNase]] removes the primer RNA fragments, and a low processivity DNA polymerase distinct from the replicative polymerase enters to fill the gaps. When this is complete, a single nick on the leading strand and several nicks on the lagging strand can be found. [[Ligase]] works to fill these nicks in, thus completing the newly replicated DNA molecule.

The primase used in this process differs significantly between [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]/[[eukaryote]]s. Bacteria use a primase belonging to the [[DnaG]] protein superfamily which contains a catalytic domain of the TOPRIM fold type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

This structure is also found in the catalytic domains of [[topoisomerase]] Ia, topoisomerase II, the OLD-family nucleases and DNA repair proteins related to the RecR protein.

The primase used by archaea and eukaryotes, in contrast, contains a highly derived version of the [[RNA recognition motif]] (RRM). This primase is structurally similar to many viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, cyclic nucleotide generating cyclases and DNA polymerases of the A/B/Y families that are involved in DNA replication and repair.  In eukaryotic replication, the primase forms a complex with Pol α.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frick|first1=David|last2=Richardson|first2=Charles|title=DNA Primases|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|date=July 2001|volume=70|pages=39–80|url=http://www.annualreviews.org.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.39?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed|doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.39|pmid=11395402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple DNA polymerases take on different roles in the DNA replication process. In ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', [[Pol III|DNA Pol III]] is the polymerase enzyme primarily responsible for DNA replication. It assembles into a replication complex at the replication fork that exhibits extremely high processivity, remaining intact for the entire replication cycle. In contrast, [[Pol I|DNA Pol I]] is the enzyme responsible for replacing RNA primers with DNA. DNA Pol I has a 5′ to 3′ [[exonuclease]] activity in addition to its polymerase activity, and uses its exonuclease activity to degrade the RNA primers ahead of it as it extends the DNA strand behind it, in a process called [[nick translation]]. Pol I is much less processive than Pol III because its primary function in DNA replication is to create many short DNA regions rather than a few very long regions.

In [[eukaryote]]s, the low-processivity enzyme, Pol α, helps to initiate replication because it forms a complex with primase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barry|first1=Elizabeth R.|last2=Bell|first2=Stephen D.|title=DNA Replication in the Archaea|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|date=8 December 2006|volume=70|issue=4|pages=876–887|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00029-06|pmid=17158702|pmc=1698513}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In eukaryotes, leading strand synthesis is thought to be conducted by Pol ε; however, this view has recently been  challenged, suggesting a role for Pol δ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stillman|first1=Bruce|title=Reconsidering DNA Polymerases at the Replication Fork in Eukaryotes|journal=Molecular Cell|date=July 2015|volume=59|issue=2|pages=139–141|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2015.07.004|pmid=26186286|pmc=4636199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Primer removal is completed Pol δ&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/1802/6537 Distinguishing the pathways of primer removal during Eukaryotic Okazaki fragment maturation] Contributor Author Rossi, Marie Louise.

As DNA synthesis continues, the original DNA strands continue to unwind on each side of the bubble, forming a [[replication fork]] with two prongs. In bacteria, which have a single origin of replication on their circular chromosome, this process creates a "[[theta structure]]" (resembling the Greek letter theta: θ). In contrast, eukaryotes have longer linear chromosomes and initiate replication at multiple origins within these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huberman|first1=Joel A.|last2=Riggs|first2=Arthur D.|title=On the mechanism of DNA replication in mammalian chromosomes|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=March 1968|volume=32|issue=2|pages=327–341|doi=10.1016/0022-2836(68)90013-2|pmid=5689363}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replication fork===
[[Image:Replication fork.svg|right|thumb|Scheme of the replication fork.&lt;br&gt;a: template, b: leading strand, c: lagging strand, d: replication fork, e: primer, f: [[Okazaki fragments]]]]
[[Image:DNA replication.svg|thumb|300px|right|Many enzymes are involved in the DNA replication fork.]]
The replication fork is a structure that forms within the nucleus during DNA replication. It is created by helicases, which break the hydrogen bonds holding the two DNA strands together. The resulting structure has two branching "prongs", each one made up of a single strand of DNA. These two strands serve as the template for the leading and lagging strands, which will be created as DNA polymerase matches complementary nucleotides to the templates; the templates may be properly referred to as the leading strand template and the lagging strand template.

'''DNA is always synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction.''' Since the leading and lagging strand templates are oriented in opposite directions at the replication fork, a major issue is how to achieve synthesis of nascent (new) lagging strand DNA, whose direction of synthesis is opposite to the direction of the growing replication fork.

====Leading strand====
The leading strand is the strand of nascent DNA which is being synthesized in the same direction as the growing replication fork. This sort of DNA replication is continuous.

====Lagging strand====
The lagging strand is the strand of nascent DNA whose direction of synthesis is opposite to the direction of the growing replication fork. Because of its orientation, replication of the lagging strand is more complicated as compared to that of the leading strand.  As a consequence, the DNA polymerase on this  strand is seen to "lag behind" the other strand.

The lagging strand is synthesized in short, separated segments. On the lagging strand ''template'', a [[primase]] "reads" the template DNA and initiates synthesis of a short complementary [[RNA]] primer. A DNA polymerase extends the primed segments, forming [[Okazaki fragment]]s. The RNA primers are then removed and replaced with DNA, and the fragments of DNA are joined together by [[DNA ligase]].

====Dynamics at the replication fork====
[[Image:1axc tricolor.png|thumb|200px|The assembled human DNA clamp, a [[trimer (biochemistry)|trimer]] of the protein [[PCNA]].]]
As helicase unwinds DNA at the replication fork, the DNA ahead is forced to rotate. This process results in a build-up of twists in the DNA ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P | title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | year=2002| publisher=Garland Science| isbn=0-8153-3218-1}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.754#787 DNA Replication Mechanisms: DNA Topoisomerases Prevent DNA Tangling During Replication]&lt;/ref&gt;    This build-up forms a torsional resistance that would eventually halt the progress of the replication fork. Topoisomerases are enzymes that temporarily break the strands of DNA, relieving the tension caused by unwinding the two strands of the DNA helix; topoisomerases (including [[DNA gyrase]]) achieve this by adding negative [[DNA supercoil|supercoils]] to the DNA helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reece|first1=Richard J.|last2=Maxwell|first2=Anthony|last3=Wang|first3=James C.|title=DNA Gyrase: Structure and Function|journal=Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|date=26 September 2008|volume=26|issue=3-4|pages=335–375|doi=10.3109/10409239109114072|pmid=1657531}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bare single-stranded DNA tends to fold back on itself forming [[Biomolecular structure#Secondary structure|secondary structures]]; these structures can interfere with the movement of DNA polymerase. To prevent this, [[single-strand binding protein]]s bind to the DNA until a second strand is synthesized, preventing secondary structure formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P | title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | year=2002| publisher=Garland Science| isbn=0-8153-3218-1}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.754#774 DNA Replication Mechanisms: Special Proteins Help to Open Up the DNA Double Helix in Front of the Replication Fork]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DNA clamp|Clamp proteins]] form a sliding clamp around DNA, helping the DNA polymerase maintain contact with its template, thereby assisting with processivity. The inner face of the clamp enables DNA to be threaded through it. Once the polymerase reaches the end of the template or detects double-stranded DNA, the sliding clamp undergoes a conformational change that releases the DNA polymerase. Clamp-loading proteins are used to initially load the clamp, recognizing the junction between template and RNA primers.&lt;ref name = Alberts/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:274-5&lt;/sup&gt;

===DNA replication proteins===
At the replication fork, many replication enzymes assemble on the DNA into a complex molecular machine called the [[replisome]]. The following is a list of major DNA replication enzymes that participate in the replisome:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Griffiths A.J.F. |author2=Wessler S.R. |author3=Lewontin R.C. |author4=Carroll S.B. | title=Introduction to Genetic Analysis| year=2008| publisher=W.

=== Replication machinery ===
'''Replication machineries''' consist of factors involved in DNA replication and appearing on template ssDNAs. Replication machineries include primosotors are replication enzymes; DNA polymerase, DNA helicases, DNA clamps and DNA topoisomerases, and replication proteins; e.g. single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB). In the replication machineries these components coordinate. In most of the bacteria, all of the factors involved in DNA replication are located on replication forks and the complexes stay on the forks during DNA replication. These replication machineries are called '''[[replisome]]s''' or '''DNA replicase systems'''. These terms are generic terms for proteins located on replication forks. In eukaryotic and some bacterial cells the replisomes are not formed.

Since replication machineries do not move relatively to template DNAs such as factories, they are called a '''replication factory'''.&lt;ref name="watson237"&gt;James D. Watson et al. (2008), "Molecular Biology of the gene", Pearson Education: 237&lt;/ref&gt; In an alternative figure, DNA factories are similar to projectors and DNAs are like as cinematic films passing constantly into the projectors. In the replication factory model, after both DNA helicases for leading strands and lagging strands are loaded on the template DNAs, the helicases run along the DNAs into each other. The helicases remain associated for the remainder of replication process. Peter Meister et al. observed directly replication sites in [[budding yeast]] by monitoring [[green fluorescent protein]](GFP)-tagged DNA polymerases α. They detected DNA replication of pairs of the tagged loci spaced apart symmetrically from a replication origin and found that the distance between the pairs decreased markedly by time.&lt;ref name="in&amp;out"&gt;Peter Meister, Angela Taddei1, Susan M. Gasser(June 2006), "In and out of the Replication Factory", ''Cell'' '''125''' (7): 1233–1235&lt;/ref&gt; This finding suggests that the mechanism of DNA replication goes with DNA factories. That is, couples of replication factories are loaded on replication origins and the factories associated with each other. Also, template DNAs move into the factories, which bring extrusion of the template ssDNAs and nascent DNAs. Meister’s finding is the first direct evidence of replication factory model. Subsequent research has shown that DNA helicases form dimers in many eukaryotic cells and bacterial replication machineries stay in single intranuclear location during DNA synthesis.&lt;ref name="watson237"/&gt;

The replication factories perform disentanglement of sister chromatids. The disentanglement is essential for distributing the chromatids into daughter cells after DNA replication. Because sister chromatids after DNA replication hold each other by '''[[Cohesin]]''' rings, there is the only chance for the disentanglement in DNA replication. Fixing of replication machineries as replication factories can improve the success rate of DNA replication. If replication forks move freely in chromosomes, catenation of nuclei is aggravated and impedes mitotic segregation.&lt;ref name="in&amp;out"/&gt;

===Termination ===
Eukaryotes initiate DNA replication at multiple points in the chromosome, so replication forks meet and terminate at many points in the chromosome.  Because eukaryotes have linear chromosomes, DNA replication is unable to reach the very end of the chromosomes.  Due to this problem, DNA is lost each replication cycle from the end of the chromosome.  [[Telomeres]] are regions of repetitive DNA close to the ends and help prevent loss of genes due to this shortening. Shortening of the telomeres is a normal process in [[somatic cell]]s.  This shortens the telomeres of the daughter DNA chromosome.  As a result, cells can only divide a certain number of times before the DNA loss prevents further division. (This is known as the [[Hayflick limit]].)  Within the [[germ cell]] line, which passes DNA to the next generation, [[telomerase]] extends the repetitive sequences of the telomere region to prevent degradation. Telomerase can become mistakenly active in somatic cells, sometimes leading to [[cancer]] formation. Increased telomerase activity is one of the hallmarks of cancer.

Termination requires that the progress of the DNA replication fork must stop or be blocked. Termination at a specific locus, when it occurs, involves the interaction between two components: (1) a termination site sequence in the DNA, and (2) a protein which binds to this sequence to physically stop DNA replication. In various bacterial species, this is named the DNA replication terminus site-binding protein, or [[Ter protein]].

Because bacteria have circular chromosomes, termination of replication occurs when the two replication forks meet each other on the opposite end of the parental chromosome. ''E. coli'' regulates this process through the use of termination sequences that, when bound by the [[Tus protein]], enable only one direction of replication fork to pass through. As a result, the replication forks are constrained to always meet within the termination region of the chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= TA Brown| title=Genomes| year=2002| publisher=[[BIOS Scientific Publishers]]| isbn=1-85996-228-9}}[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=genomes.section.8121#8156 13.2.3.

==Regulation==
{{Main|Cell division|Cell cycle}}

[[Image:Cell Cycle 2.svg|thumb|150px|The cell cycle of eukaryotic cells.]]

===Eukaryotes===
Within eukaryotes, DNA replication is controlled within the context of the [[cell cycle]]. As the cell grows and divides, it progresses through stages in the cell cycle; DNA replication takes place during the S phase (synthesis phase). The progress of the eukaryotic cell through the cycle is controlled by [[cell cycle checkpoint]]s. Progression through checkpoints is controlled through complex interactions between various proteins, including [[cyclin]]s and [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P | title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | year=2002| publisher=Garland Science| isbn=0-8153-3218-1}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.3214#3215 Intracellular Control of Cell-Cycle Events: S-Phase Cyclin-Cdk Complexes (S-Cdks) Initiate DNA Replication Once Per Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike bacteria, eukaryotic DNA replicates in the confines of the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Genomes|last = Brown|first = TA|publisher = Wiley-Liss|year = 2002|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = |edition = 2nd|chapter = 13|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21113/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The G1/S checkpoint (or restriction checkpoint) regulates whether eukaryotic cells enter the process of DNA replication and subsequent division. Cells that do not proceed through this checkpoint remain in the G0 stage and do not replicate their DNA.

Replication of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes occurs independently of the cell cycle, through the process of [[D-loop replication]].

==== Replication focus ====
In vertebrate cells, replication sites concentrate into positions called '''replication foci'''.&lt;ref name="in&amp;out"/&gt; Replication sites can be detected by immunostaining daughter strands and replication enzymes and monitoring GFP-tagged replication factors. By these methods it is found that replication foci of varying size and positions appear in S phase of cell division and their number per nucleus is far smaller than the number of genomic replication forks.

P. Heun et al.(2001) tracked GFP-tagged replication foci in budding yeast cells and revealed that replication origins move constantly in G1 and S phase and the [[Molecular dynamics|dynamics]] decreased significantly in S phase.&lt;ref name="in&amp;out"/&gt; Traditionally, replication sites were fixed on spatial structure of chromosomes by [[nuclear matrix]] or [[lamin]]s. The Heun’s results denied the traditional concepts, budding yeasts don't have lamins, and support that replication origins self-assemble and form replication foci.

By firing of replication origins, controlled spatially and temporally, the formation of replication foci is regulated. D. A. Jackson et al.(1998) revealed that neighboring origins fire simultaneously in mammalian cells.&lt;ref name="in&amp;out"/&gt; Spatial juxtaposition of replication sites brings '''clustering''' of replication forks. The clustering do '''rescue of stalled replication forks''' and favors normal progress of replication forks. Progress of replication forks is inhibited by many factors; collision with proteins or with complexes binding strongly on DNA, deficiency of dNTPs, nicks on template DNAs and so on. If replication forks stall and the remaining sequences from the stalled forks are not replicated, the daughter strands have nick obtained un-replicated sites. The un-replicated sites on one parent's strand hold the other strand together but not daughter strands. Therefore, the resulting sister chromatids cannot separate from each other and cannot divide into 2 daughter cells. When neighboring origins fire and a fork from one origin is stalled, fork from other origin access on an opposite direction of the stalled fork and duplicate the un-replicated sites. As other mechanism of the rescue there is application of '''dormant replication origins''' that excess origins don't fire in normal DNA replication.

===Bacteria===
[[File:Hemimethylation.svg|thumb|200px|Dam methylates adenine of GATC sites after replication.]]
Most bacteria do not go through a well-defined cell cycle but instead continuously copy their DNA; during rapid growth, this can result in the concurrent occurrence of multiple rounds of replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Obligate Human Pathogen, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Is Polyploid|vauthors=Tobiason DM, Seifert HS | journal=PLoS Biology| year=2006| volume=4| issue=6| doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040185| pages=e185| pmid=16719561| pmc=1470461}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''E. coli'', the best-characterized bacteria, DNA replication is regulated through several mechanisms, including: the hemimethylation and sequestering of the origin sequence, the ratio of [[Adenosine triphosphate|adenosine triphosphate (ATP)]] to [[Adenosine diphosphate|adenosine diphosphate (ADP)]], and the levels of protein DnaA. All these control the binding of initiator proteins to the origin sequences.

Because ''E. coli'' [[DNA methylation|methylates]] GATC DNA sequences, DNA synthesis results in hemimethylated sequences. This hemimethylated DNA is recognized by the protein [[SeqA protein domain|SeqA]], which binds and sequesters the origin sequence; in addition, DnaA (required for initiation of replication) binds less well to hemimethylated DNA. As a result, newly replicated origins are prevented from immediately initiating another round of DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slater|first1=Steven|last2=Wold|first2=Sture|last3=Lu|first3=Min|last4=Boye|first4=Erik|last5=Skarstad|first5=Kirsten|last6=Kleckner|first6=Nancy|title=E. coli SeqA protein binds oriC in two different methyl-modulated reactions appropriate to its roles in DNA replication initiation and origin sequestration|journal=Cell|date=September 1995|volume=82|issue=6|pages=927–936|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90272-4|pmid=7553853}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

ATP builds up when the cell is in a rich medium, triggering DNA replication once the cell has reached a specific size. ATP competes with ADP to bind to DnaA, and the DnaA-ATP complex is able to initiate replication. A certain number of DnaA proteins are also required for DNA replication — each time the origin is copied, the number of binding sites for DnaA doubles, requiring the synthesis of more DnaA to enable another initiation of replication.

==Polymerase chain reaction==
{{Main article|Polymerase chain reaction}}
Researchers commonly replicate DNA ''in vitro'' using the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). PCR uses a pair of [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] to span a target region in template DNA, and then polymerizes partner strands in each direction from these primers using a thermostable [[DNA polymerase]]. Repeating this process through multiple cycles amplifies the targeted DNA region. At the start of each cycle, the mixture of template and primers is heated, separating the newly synthesized molecule and template. Then, as the mixture cools, both of these become templates for annealing of new primers, and the polymerase extends from these. As a result, the number of copies of the target region doubles each round, [[exponential growth|increasing exponentially]].&lt;ref name="Saiki2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saiki|first1=Randall|last2=Gelfand|first2=David H.|last3=Stoffel|first3=Susanne|last4=Scharf|first4=Stephen J.|last5=Higuchi|first5=Russell|last6=Horn|first6=Glenn T.|last7=Mullis|first7=Kary B.|last8=Erlich|first8=Henry A.|title=Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase|journal=Science|date=29 January 1988|volume=239|issue=4839|pages=487–491|doi=10.1126/science.2448875|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/239/4839/487.long|accessdate=7 April 2016|pmid=2448875|bibcode=1988Sci...239..487S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muammar Gaddafi]], the deposed leader of [[Libya]], was captured and killed on 20 October 2011 during the [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|Battle of Sirte]]. Gaddafi was found hiding in a [[culvert]] west of Sirte and captured by [[National Transitional Council]] forces. He was killed shortly afterwards. The NTC initially claimed he died from injuries sustained in a firefight when loyalist forces attempted to free him, although a graphic video of his last moments show rebel fighters beating him and one of them sodomizing him with a bayonet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/20/muammar-gaddafi-killing-witnesses |title=Gaddafi's last moments: 'I saw the hand holding the gun and I saw it fire' |author=Martin Chulov |website=theguardian.com |date=20 October 2012 &lt;!--Last modified on Sunday 21 October 2012 --&gt; |quote=one fighter crouched in the dirt behind the frightened captive and sodomised him with a bayonet |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before he was shot several times as he pleaded for his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2054344/Gaddafis-killers-trial-mob-execution-vow-Libyas-new-rulers.html|title=Gaddafi's killers will be put on trial over mob execution, vow Libya's new rulers|work=Daily Mail|date=28 October 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011|location=London|first=Sam|last=Greenhill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
After the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|fall of Tripoli]] to forces of the opposition [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) in August 2011, Gaddafi and his family escaped the Libyan capital. He was widely rumoured to have taken refuge in the south of the country.  In fact, though, Gaddafi had fled in a small convoy to [[Sirte]] on the day Tripoli fell. His son [[Mutassim Gaddafi]] followed in a second convoy.&lt;ref name="startribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/world/132383263.html |work=Star Tribune |date=22 October 2011 |author=Kareem Fahim |accessdate=23 October 2011 |title=In his last days, Gadhafi survived on pasta and delusions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024203209/http://www.startribune.com/world/132383263.html |archivedate=24 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2011, Libya's prime minister [[Mahmoud Jibril]] said that the former leader was believed to be in the southern desert, reestablishing his government among pro-Gaddafi tribes in the region. By that point the NTC had just taken control of the pro-Gaddafi town of [[Bani Walid]] and were close to taking control of Gaddafi's home town, the tribal heartland of [[Sirte]] east of Tripoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi 'is recruiting fighters from other African countries'|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=20 October 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/20/gaddafi-recruiting-fighters-african-countries |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to most accounts, Gaddafi had been with heavily armed regime loyalists in several buildings in Sirte for several months as NTC forces took the city.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44971257/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/libyas-moammar-gadhafi-killed-hometown-battle/|title=Libya's Moammar Gadhafi killed in hometown battle|accessdate=20 October 2011|agency=Associated Press|publisher=MSNBC|date=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mansour Dhao]], a member of Gaddafi's inner circle and leader of the regime's [[People's Guard (Libya)|People's Guard]], said that Gaddafi was "very delusional" and complained about the lack of electricity and water. Attempts to persuade him to flee the country and give up power were ignored.&lt;ref name="startribune" /&gt; As [[Battle of Sirte (2011)#Final assault|the last loyalist district of Sirte fell]], Gaddafi and other members of the government attempted to flee.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Kareem|last1=Fahim|first2=Rick|last2=Gladstone|first3=Anthony|last3=Shadid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/world/africa/qaddafi-is-killed-as-libyan-forces-take-surt.html|title=Violent End to an Era as Qaddafi Dies in Libya|work=The New York Times|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=29 October 2011|location=Misrata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 01:30  local time (03:30 [[UTC]]) on 20 October 2011, Gaddafi, his army chief [[Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr]], his security chief [[Mansour Dhao]], and a group of loyalists attempted to escape the violence in a convoy of 75 vehicles.&lt;ref name="nytimesfahim"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/world/africa/in-his-last-days-qaddafi-wearied-of-fugitives-life.html|work=The New York Times|first=Kareem|last=Fahim|title=In His Last Days, Qaddafi Wearied of Fugitive’s Life|date=22 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8839964/Col-Gaddafi-killed-convoy-bombed-by-drone-flown-by-pilot-in-Las-Vegas.html|title=Col Gaddafi killed-convoy bombed by drone flown by pilot in Las Vegas |work=The Telegraph |date=20 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011|location=London|first=Thomas|last=Harding}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Royal Air Force]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]] spotted the convoy moving at high speed, after NATO forces intercepted a satellite phone call made by Gaddafi.&lt;ref name="spon"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,793179,00.html|title=Wie die Nato Gaddafi jagte |language=German|work=Der Spiegel|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO aircraft then fired on 21 of the vehicles, destroying one. A U.S. [[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] operated from a base near [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; fired the first missiles at the convoy, hitting its target about {{convert|3|km|0}} west of Sirte. Moments later, [[French Air Force]] [[Rafale]] fighter jets continued the bombing.&lt;ref name="Dailymail"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2051782/How-NATO-air-strike-finished-Gaddafi.html|title=How a NATO air strike finished off Gaddafi|work=Daily Mail|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=21 October 2011|location=London|first=David |last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NATO bombing immobilized much of the convoy and killed dozens of loyalist fighters. Following the first strike, some 11 vehicles broke away from the main group and continued moving south. A second NATO airstrike damaged or destroyed 20 of these vehicles.{{Contradict-inline|reason=How can 20 vehicles be destroyed when only 11 broke away?|date=August 2017}} Rebel units on the ground also struck the convoy.&lt;ref name="Blitz"&gt;James Blitz and Hugh Carnegy. "[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/af362fc0-fb2e-11e0-8756-00144feab49a.html Confusion over Nato role in Gaddafi death]" (20 October 2011). ''Financial Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to their statement, NATO was not aware at the time of the strike that Gaddafi was in the convoy. NATO stated that in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|Security Council Resolution 1973]], it does not target individuals but only military assets that pose a threat. NATO later learned, "from [[Open source intelligence|open sources]] and Allied [[Military intelligence|intelligence]]", that Gaddafi was in the convoy and that the strike likely contributed to his capture.&lt;ref name="Blitz"/&gt;

After the airstrike, which destroyed the vehicle in front of Muammar Gaddafi's car, he and his son Mutassim, and former defence minister [[Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr]], took shelter in a nearby house, which was then shelled by NTC forces.

Mutassim then took 20 fighters and went to look for undamaged cars, having persuaded his father to come too. "The group belly-crawled to a sand berm," a UN report, released in March 2012  said, and then through two drainage pipes and set up a defensive position.

One of Gaddafi's guards threw a grenade at advancing rebels on the road above, but it hit a concrete wall above the pipes and fell in front of Gaddafi. The guard tried to pick it up, but it exploded, killing both the guard and Yunis Jabr.&lt;ref name="in.reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/03/02/libya-gaddafi-idINDEE8210HI20120302| agency=Reuters|title=Gaddafi wanted to stage last stand in desert - U.N. report|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture and death===

Gaddafi took refuge in a large [[Culvert|drainage pipe]] with several loyalist bodyguards. A nearby group of NTC fighters opened fire, wounding Gaddafi with gunshots to his leg and back. According to one unnamed NTC fighter, one of Gaddafi's own loyalists also shot him, apparently to spare him from being captured.&lt;ref name="Guardian - Gaddafi killed"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2011/oct/20/gaddafi-killed-sirte-falls-live|title=Gaddafi killed as Sirte falls|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011 |first=Adam |last=Gabbatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Martin – [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/10/20/eveningnews/main20123436.shtml "Who shot Qaddafi? Was it his own bodyguards?"] – ''CBS News'' – 20 October 2011. Retrieved 21 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if NATO aircraft were involved in helping secure Gaddafi's capture by Libyan forces on the ground.&lt;ref name="Blitz"/&gt; A group of rebels approached the pipe where Gaddafi was hiding and ordered him to come out, which he slowly did. He was then dragged up to his feet as rebels shouted "Muammar, Muammar!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/20/muammar-gaddafi-killing-witnesses|title=Gaddafi's last moments: 'I saw the hand holding the gun and I saw it fire'|author=Martin Chulov|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a UN report released in March 2012 revealed a different account of Gaddafi's capture. Gaddafi was wounded by grenade fragmentation, from a grenade thrown by one of his own men, that bounced off a wall and fell in front of Gaddafi, that shredded his [[flak jacket]]. He sat on the floor dazed and in shock, bleeding from a wound in the left temple. Then one of his group waved a white turban in surrender.&lt;ref name="in.reuters.com"/&gt;

Gaddafi was killed shortly afterwards. There are conflicting reports; according to one report, Gaddafi said "Please don't shoot!" prior to being shot,&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite news|title="Don't shoot": Qaddafi's last moments|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20123183-503543.html|accessdate=20 October 2011|newspaper=CBS News|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when questioned by Misratan rebel fighters about the damage done to [[Misrata]] by his forces, denied any involvement, and begged his captors not to hit him or kill him. One fighter demanded Gaddafi stand up, but he struggled to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15889840|date=28 November 2011|accessdate=8 December 2011|publisher=BBC News|title=Libyan fighter: I spoke to Gaddafi before he died}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi can be heard in one video saying "God forbids this" and "Do you know right from wrong?" when being shouted at by his captors.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/23/us-libya-gaddafi-finalhours-idUSTRE79M02W20111023|agency=Reuters|title=Clues to Gaddafi's death concealed from public view|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Raymond A.

Several videos related to the death were broadcast by news channels and circulated via the Internet. The first shows footage of Gaddafi alive, his face and shirt bloodied, stumbling and being dragged toward an ambulance by armed militants chanting "[[Takbir|God is great]]" in [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The video shows Gaddafi being sodomized with a bayonet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GlobalPost: Qaddafi apparently sodomized after capture|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20124758-503543/globalpost-qaddafi-apparently-sodomized-after-capture/ |quote=a GlobalPost analysis of video footage suggests a Libyan fighter sodomized the former dictator after he was captured near Sirte. |publisher=CBS |accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = SHersh&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seymour Hersh |authorlink=Seymour Hersh |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n01/seymour-m-hersh/military-to-military |title=Military to Military: Seymour M.

Although an NTC spokesman said Gaddafi's body would be returned to his family with a directive to keep his burial site secret after an [[autopsy]] had determined the cause of death,&lt;ref name="nytimesfahim"/&gt; the semi-autonomous military council in Misrata said it would be buried quickly instead, vetoing the idea of an autopsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/Gaddafi-family-demands-body-NATO-ends-Libya-war/articleshow/10452972.cms|work=The Times of India|title=Muammar Gaddafi family demands body, Nato ends Libya war|date=22 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-oct-22-2011-2041|publisher=Al Jazeera|title=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] called for an independent autopsy and an investigation into how Gaddafi died,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/10/21/does_it_really_matter_if_qaddafi_was_executed|work=Foreign Policy|first=Blake|last=Hounshell|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011|title=Does it really matter if Qaddafi was executed?}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Jibril said neither step was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8843756/Libya-to-greet-dawn-of-new-era.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=22 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011|title=Libya to greet dawn of new era|first=Damien|last=McElroy|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October, NTC representatives announced that Gaddafi's body had been buried in an unknown location in the desert early that morning, together with those of his son [[Mutassim Gaddafi]] and the regime's defense minister [[Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi buried in unknown location, reports say|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/25/muammar-gaddafi-buried-libya|work=The Guardian|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=25 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-25/gaddafi-buried-in-secret-location-at-dawn/3600098|title=Gaddafi buried in secret location at dawn|publisher=ABC News|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/10/2011102573231228800.html|title=NTC says Gaddafi buried in secret grave|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dubai-based satellite TV channel [[Al Aan TV]] showed amateur footage of the funeral taking place at an unknown location where Islamic prayers were read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mousa|first=Jenan|script-title=ar:تجهيز جثمان القذافي للدفن في الصحراء الليبية - صور حصرية|url=http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/Processing-Gaddafi-body-burial-Libyan-desert/|accessdate=28 October 2011|newspaper=Akhbar Alaan|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi Funeral Video: Footage Claims To Show Secret Ceremony|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/26/gaddafi-funeral-video_n_1032728.html|accessdate=28 October 2011|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=26 October 2011|first=Clare|last=Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libya's Minister for Information [[Mahmoud Shammam]] said that a [[fatwa]] had declared that "Gaddafi should not be buried in Muslim cemeteries and should not be buried in a known place to avoid any sedition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15441867 |title=Col Gaddafi 'buried in secret, desert grave at dawn'|publisher=BBC|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign involvement===
====United States====
{{further|American involvement in the 2011 Libyan Civil War}}
Moments after it was reported that Gaddafi was killed, [[Fox News]] published an article titled "U.S. Drone Involved in Final Qaddafi Strike, as Obama Heralds Regime's 'End'",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/10/20/obama-qaddafi-death-ends-long-and-painful-chapter-in-libya.html|title=U.S. Drone Involved in Final Qaddafi Strike, as Obama Heralds Regime's 'End'|work=Fox News|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that a U.S. Predator drone was involved in the airstrike on Gaddafi's convoy in the moments before his death. An anonymous US official subsequently described their policy in hindsight as "lead[ing] from behind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-15393497|title=Gaddafi killed: A new kind of US foreign policy success|work=BBC News|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Libyan rebels had consistently told American government officials that they did not want overt foreign military assistance in toppling Gaddafi, [[Covert operation|covert military assistance]] was used (including arms shipments to opposition). The plan following Gaddafi's death was to immediately begin flowing humanitarian assistance to eastern Libya and later western Libya, as the symbolism would be critically important. US sources stressed it as important that they would "not allow [[Turkey]], [[Italy]] and others to steal a march on it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/6604|title=WikiLeaks|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concurrent capture or death of relatives and associates ==
National Transitional Council officials also announced that one of Gaddafi's sons, [[Mutassim Gaddafi]], once the Libyan national security advisor, was killed in Sirte the same day. A video later surfaced showing Mutassim's body lying in an ambulance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd0_S25NlIA&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player&amp;skipcontrinter=1 |title=Mutassim's body |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A video aired on [[Arrai TV|Al Arrai television]] showed Mutassim alive and talking to his captors. The circumstances of his death are unclear.&lt;ref name="aj22" /&gt;

Another son, [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], was captured almost a month after his father's death, whilst trying to flee to Niger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/20111119111936535209.html |title=Saif al-Islam Gaddafi arrested in Libya |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=19 November 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage had emerged earlier on 20 October of the body of Gaddafi's defence minister, [[Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr]]. Abdul Hakim Al Jalil, the commander of the NTC's 11th brigade, stated that former Gaddafi spokesman [[Moussa Ibrahim]] had been captured near Sirte. Reports indicate that Ahmed Ibrahim, one of Gaddafi's cousins, was also captured.&lt;ref name="Al-Jazeera"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Muammar Gaddafi killed as Sirte falls | publisher=Al Jazeera | date = 20 October 2011 | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111020111520869621.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent events ==
=== Calls for investigation ===
Numerous organizations, including the [[United Nations]] and the U.S. and UK governments, have called for an investigation of the exact circumstances of Gaddafi's death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=156787|title=Calls grow for full investigation into Gaddafi’s death|author=Karin Laub|work=Business Day|location=South Africa|date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; amid controversy that it was an [[extrajudicial killing]] and a [[war crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-22/call-for-probe-into-gaddafi-death/3595198/?site=melbourne|title=Pressure grows for Gaddafi death investigation|date=22 October 2011|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN calls for probe into Gaddafi's death|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111021235116164421.html|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, had said there should be a full investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-15390980|title=Muammar Gaddafi: How he died|author=|work=BBC News|location=|date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UN Human Rights Office]] spokesperson said that he expects the UN commission already investigating potential human rights abuse in Libya would look into the case.&lt;ref name="aj22"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111021235116164421.html |title=UN calls for probe into Gaddafi's death |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=22 October 2011 |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waheed Burshan]], a member of the NTC, said that an investigation should happen.&lt;ref name="aj22-2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111022133513323321.html |title=Doubts cast on official Gaddafi death account |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=22 October 2011 |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2011, the NTC announced that it had ordered an investigation in response to the international calls&lt;ref name="aj24"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/2011102413358850809.html |title=Libya's NTC orders probe into Gaddafi killing  |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it would prosecute the killers if the investigation showed he died after his capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/north/Libya-Vows-to-Prosecute-Gadhafi-Killers-132700743.html|title=Libya Vows to Prosecute Gadhafi Killers |publisher= [[Voice of America]] |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Almost a year later, on 17 October 2012, new evidence was revealed by [[Human Rights Watch]] showing that mass killings occurred at the site of Gaddafi's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/16/libya-new-proof-mass-killings-gaddafi-death-site|title=Libya: New Proof of Mass Killings at Gaddafi Death Site|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional ramifications ===
In its immediate aftermath, the controversial killing of Gaddafi was thought to have significant implications in the Middle East, as a critical part of the wider '[[Arab Spring]]'.&lt;ref name="ASPO-H-06"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.periscopepost.com/2011/10/arab-spring-domino-effect-gaddafi-is-gone-will-syrias-al-assad-be-the-next-arab-autocrat-toppled/|title=Arab Spring domino effect: Gaddafi is gone, will Syria’s al-Assad be the next Arab autocrat toppled?|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASPO-H-07"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8839143/Arab-Spring-timeline-of-the-African-and-Middle-East-rebellions.html|title=Arab Spring: timeline of the African and Middle East rebellions|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=24 June 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former CIA analyst [[Bruce Riedel]] speculated that the death would intensify protesting in [[Syrian uprising (2011–present)|Syria]] and [[2011–2012 Yemeni revolution|Yemen]], and French officials stated that because of this they were "watching the [[2010–2012 Algerian protests|Algerian situation]]".&lt;ref name="Daily Beast Next"&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/10/20/qaddafi-s-death-send-clear-message-to-middle-east-dictators-run-will-algiers-be-next.html "Which Middle East Dictator Is Going Down Next?"] World News – ''The Daily Beast -'' 20 October 2011 – 20 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vengeance===
Omran Shaban, the Misrata fighter who discovered Gaddafi in the drain pipe and who had posed in photos with his golden gun, was captured by [[Gaddafi loyalism after the 2011 Libyan Civil War|Green Resistance]] soldiers in Bani Walid. He was then paralysed and severely tortured. The interim president of Libya secured his release but he died some days later from his wounds in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=George Grant |url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/09/25/libyan-revolutionary-who-captured-qaddafi-dies-in-paris/ |title=Libyan revolutionary who captured Qaddafi dies in Paris |publisher=[[Libya Herald]] |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}{{subscription needed}}

==Domestic reactions==
Prime Minister [[Mahmoud Jibril]] said he wished Gaddafi had remained alive so he could be tried for [[crimes against humanity]],&lt;ref name="autopsy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-20124313/autopsy-qaddafi-was-killed-by-shot-to-head/|work=CBS News|date=23 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011|title=Autopsy: Qaddafi was killed by shot to head}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying he had wanted to serve as Gaddafi's prosecutor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/86293,news-comment,news-politics,-libyan-prime-minister-mahmoud-jibril-i-wish-gaddafi-had-not-been-killed|work=The First Post|title=Libyan PM: I wish Gaddafi had not been killed|date=23 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now that he was dead, Libya would need a meticulous plan for the transition to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/international/remember_years_of_agony_in_libya_says_mahmoud_jibril_1_1925839|work=The Scotsman|title=Remember years of agony in Libya, says Mahmoud Jibril|date=22 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unelected head of state said, "Our forces' resistance to Gaddafi ended well, with the help of God." He declared Libya to be "liberated" at a ceremony in [[Benghazi]] on 23 October, three days after Gaddafi's death.&lt;ref name="declib"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f459749a-fd86-11e0-a9db-00144feabdc0.html|title=Libya declares liberation after Gaddafi's death|date=23 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011|first=Borzou|last=Daragahi|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NTC official [[Ali Tarhouni]] said on 22 October that he had instructed the military council in Misrata to keep Gaddafi's body preserved for several days in a commercial freezer "to make sure that everybody knows he is dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailynews.co.zw/index.php/news/34-news/4813-libya-delays-burial-plans-for-dictator.html|publisher=BBC News|title=Libya delays burial plans for dictator|date=22 October 2011|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Tarhouni admitted that there had been human rights abuses in the Battle of Sirte, which he said the NTC condemned, and claimed the Executive Board "did not want to put an end to that tyrant's life before bringing him to trial and making him answer questions that have always haunted Libyans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2011/10/26/feature-01|work=Magharebia|title=NTC vows to probe rights abuses, control arms|date=26 October 2011|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesman for the Misrata military council, [[Fathi Bashagha]], stated the council was confident Gaddafi was dead and that he had died of wounds sustained during fighting before his capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2011/s3345172.htm|publisher=ABC News|title=Misurata militia says it still has Gaddafi's body|first=Peter|last=Cave|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saadi Gaddafi]], one of Muammar Gaddafi's surviving sons in exile in [[Niger]], said through an attorney that he was "shocked and outraged by vicious brutality" toward his father and his brother, [[Mutassim Gaddafi]], and that the killing showed that the new Libyan leadership could not be trusted to hold fair trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-oct-24-2011-0002|work=Al Jazeera Blogs|title=Sun, 23 Oct 2011, 21:02 GMT+3 - Libya|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reactions==

Many leaders and foreign ministers of [[Europe]]an countries, as well as fellow [[Western world|Western]] countries like [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]], made statements hailing Gaddafi's death as a positive development for Libya. The [[city-state]] of [[Vatican City]] responded to the event by declaring it recognised the [[National Transitional Council]] as Libya's legitimate government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/world-looks-warily-to-1206420.html|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|title=World looks warily to Libya's future post-Gadhafi|first=Raphael|last=Satter|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; World leaders such as [[Italy|Italian]] Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=News of Gadhafi's Death Met With Relief |agency=[[Associated Press]] [[Thomson Reuters|Reuters]] |work=[[Voice of America|VOA News]] |date=20 October 2011 |url= http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Reports-of-Gadhafis-Death-Met-with-Relief--132240193.html |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-21/gillard-abbott-on-gaddafi-death/3590956|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|title=Gaddafi death brings 'relief' to Libya: Gillard|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the death of Gaddafi meant the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] was over.

The video reportedly left a particularly strong, and consequential, impression on Russia's [[Vladimir Putin]]. A senior diplomat who had served at the US embassy in Moscow under the Obama administration reportedly claimed that "Putin had been appalled by Gaddafi’s fate"&lt;ref name=Hersh&gt;[[Seymour Hersh]], [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n01/seymour-m-hersh/military-to-military 'Military to Military,'] [[London Review of Books]], Vol. 38 No. 1,7 January 2016 pp.11-14. Retrieved 13 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; to the extent that "Putin had watched a video of Gaddafi’s savage death three times, a video that shows him being sodomised with a bayonet."&lt;ref name=Hersh/&gt; Referring to the U.S. coalition's lobbying efforts for the airstrikes at the U.N., the U.S. diplomat is quoted as saying that a later U.S. intelligence assessment concluded that "Putin blamed himself for letting Gaddafi go, for not playing a strong role behind the scenes" and that the video may have even influenced Putin's decision to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war since "Putin believed that unless he got engaged Bashar would suffer the same fate – mutilated – and he’d see the destruction of his allies in Syria."&lt;ref name=Hersh/&gt;
Putin also lashed out at the [[United States|U.S.]] for the illegal killing of Gaddafi and asked "They showed to the whole world how he (Gaddafi) was killed; there was blood all over. Is that what they call a democracy?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Deng Shasha |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2011-12/15/c_131309049.htm |title=Putin slams U.S. on Gaddafi killing |publisher=Xinhua |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO===
{{main|International reactions to the death of Muammar Gaddafi#Intergovernmental organizations}}

Immediately after Gaddafi's death, [[NATO]] released a statement denying it knew beforehand that Gaddafi was travelling in the convoy it struck. Admiral [[James G. Stavridis]], NATO's top officer, said the death of Gaddafi meant that NATO would likely wind down [[Operation Unified Protector|its operations in Libya]].&lt;ref name=Stavridis&gt;"[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-20123633/nato-commander-to-recommend-libya-mission-end/ NATO commander to recommend Libya mission end]" (21 October 2011).

'''Etan Kalil Patz''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|t|ɑː|n|_|ˈ|p|eɪ|t|s}}; October 9, 1972 – May 25, 1979;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/etan_patz_was_strangled_to_dea.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[declared death in absentia|declared legally dead]] in 2001) was an American boy who was six years old on May 25, 1979, when he disappeared on his way to his [[school bus]] stop in the [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] neighborhood of [[Lower Manhattan]]. His disappearance helped launch the [[Child abduction|missing children movement]], which included new legislation and new methods for tracking down missing children. Several years after he disappeared, Patz was one of the first children to be profiled on the "[[photo on a milk carton]]" campaigns of the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toppo|first1=Greg|title=Etan Patz – boy on the milk carton – gets justice: Man convicted in 1979 murder|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/02/14/nyc-jury-reaches-verdict-etan-patz-murder-case/97894676/|accessdate=March 26, 2018|work=[[USA Today]]|date=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, President [[Ronald Reagan]] designated May 25—the anniversary of Etan's disappearance—as [[National Missing Children's Day]] in the United States.

Decades later, it was determined that Etan had been abducted and murdered the same day that he went missing. The case was reopened in 2010 by the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney]]'s office. In 2012, the [[FBI]] excavated the basement of the alleged crime scene near the Patz residence but discovered no new evidence. Pedro Hernandez—a suspect who confessed— was charged and indicted later that year on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping. In 2014, the case went through a series of hearings to determine whether or not Hernandez's statements before he received his [[Miranda warning|Miranda rights]] were legally admissible at trial. His trial began in January 2015 and ended in a mistrial that May, when one of the 12 jurors held out. The retrial began on October 19, 2016, and concluded on February 14, 2017, after nine days of deliberations, when the jury found Hernandez guilty of [[murder]] and [[kidnapping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement from John F.

==Disappearance==
On the morning of May 25, 1979, Etan left his [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] apartment at 113 Prince Street by himself for the first time, planning to walk two blocks to board a school bus at [[West Broadway]] and Prince Street.&lt;ref name=TimesMay28&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/05/27/120970566.pdf |title=Police and Neighbors Join in a SoHo Search For Missing Schoolboy |date=May 27, 1979 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=May 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was wearing a black "Future Flight Captain" pilot cap, a blue corduroy jacket, blue jeans and blue [[sneakers]] with fluorescent stripes. He never got on the bus.&lt;ref name=TimesMay30&gt;{{cite news |last=Kihss |first=Peter |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/05/30/111031936.pdf |title=Boy Missing From SoHo Was on Own First Time |date=May 30, 1979 |newspaper=The New York Times |quote=He never made the last half block ... to the corner where another mother waited for him until 8:20 ... |accessdate=May 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At school, Etan's teacher noticed his absence but did not report it to the principal. When Etan did not return home after school, his mother Julie called the police. At first, detectives considered the Patzes to be possible suspects but quickly determined they had no involvement. An intense search began that evening, using nearly 100 police officers and a team of [[bloodhound]]s. The search continued for weeks. Neighbors and police canvassed the city and placed missing-child posters featuring Etan's portrait, but this resulted in few leads.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18188241 |title=Etan Patz death: Man confesses to NYC killing in 1979 |date=May 25, 2012 |work=BBC News |accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AbdChanged&gt;{{cite news|author=Ramirez, Jessica |date=January 29, 2007|title=The Abductions That Changed America|work=[[Newsweek]]|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etan's father Stanley was a professional photographer and had a collection of photographs he had taken of his son. His photos of Etan were printed on countless missing-child posters and milk cartons. They were also projected on screens in [[Times Square]].&lt;ref name=ABCNews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/etan-patz-missing-boy-case-reopened-31-years/story?id=10749565 |title=Etan Patz Case Reopened 31 Years Later|last1=Berman |first1=Thomas |last2=Sher |first2=Lauren |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |work=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations against Jose Ramos==
Assistant [[United States Attorney]] Stuart R. GraBois received the case in 1985 and identified Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted [[child sexual abuse]]r who had been a friend of Etan's former babysitters, as the primary suspect. In 1982, multiple boys had accused Ramos of trying to lure them into a [[Storm drain|drain pipe]] in the area where Ramos was living. When police searched the drain pipe, they found photographs of Ramos and young boys who resembled Etan. GraBois eventually found out that Ramos had been in custody in [[Pennsylvania]] in connection with an unrelated child molestation case. In 1990, GraBois was deputized as a deputy state attorney general in Pennsylvania to help prosecute a case against Ramos for sexually abusing children and to obtain further information about Etan's case. When first questioned by GraBois, Ramos stated that, on the day when Etan disappeared, he had taken a young boy back to his apartment to [[rape]] him. Ramos said that he was "90 percent sure" it was the boy whom he later saw on television. However, Ramos did not use Etan's name. He also claimed he had "put the boy on a subway".{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 1991, while Ramos was incarcerated, a [[Informant#Jailhouse informants|jailhouse informant]] told GraBois and FBI agent Mary Galligan that Ramos had told him he knew what had happened to Etan. Ramos even drew a map of Etan's school bus route, indicating that he knew that Etan's bus stop was the third one on the route.&lt;ref name="ABCNews" /&gt; In a special feature on missing children, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported on October 21, 1999, that Ramos was the prime suspect in Etan's  disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Weiss, Murray (October 21, 1999|title=Where are these kids? NYPD creates a new squad to investigate unsolved missing kid cases|work=New York Post|page=32}} "Investigators now believe a pedophile in prison in Pennsylvania for abusing two children there is the prime suspect in Patz's disappearance, but he has never been charged in the New York case." Accessed via [[LexisNexis]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ramos had been known by the Patz family and was the prime suspect all along, but in the early 1980s authorities were unable to prosecute Ramos.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Etan's body was never found; he was declared [[legally dead]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="nymag"/&gt; Stan and Julie Patz pursued and won a [[civil case]] against Ramos in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/nyregion/judge-rules-that-convicted-molester-now-prison-responsible-for-etan-patz-s-death.html|title=Judge Rules That a Convicted Molester, Now in Prison, Is Responsible for Etan Patz's Death|last=Saulny|first=Susan|date=May 5, 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were awarded a symbolic sum of $2 million, which they have [[judgment proof|never collected]].&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Etan-Patz-Case-SoHo-Search-FBI-NYPD-148088675.html|title=FBI, NYPD Resume Search for Etan Patz, Boy Who Disappeared in 1979|last=Prokupecz|first=Shimon|date=April 19, 2012|work=[[NBC]]|accessdate=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramos has never been criminally prosecuted for the murder of Etan. Every year, on Etan's birthday and the anniversary of his disappearance, Stan Patz sent Ramos a copy of his son's missing-child poster. On the back, he typed the same message: "What did you do to my little boy?"&lt;ref name=ABCNews/&gt;&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/56441/ |title=What happened to Etan Patz |last=Cohen|first=Lisa R. |date=May 3, 2009 |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cityroom"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/a-new-horror-recalls-another/ |title=A New Horror Recalls Another |last=Haberman |first=Clyde |date=July 14, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramos has denied that he killed Etan.&lt;ref name=ABCNews/&gt;  He served a 20-year prison sentence in the [[State Correctional Institution – Dallas|State Correctional Institution]] in [[Dallas, Pennsylvania]], for child molestation.&lt;ref name="cityroom"/&gt; He was released from prison on November 7, 2012. Soon after his release he was arrested on a [[Megan's Law]] violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Longtime Etan Patz Suspect Released, Then Held |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/longtime-suspect-etan-patz-case-be-released-0 |first=Michael |last=Rubinkam |work=Associated Press |date=November 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110064444/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/longtime-suspect-etan-patz-case-be-released-0 |archivedate=November 10, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stan and Julie Patz had the 2004 judgment against Ramos dismissed after the 2015 trial of Pedro Hernandez convinced them that Ramos was not responsible for their son's death.&lt;ref name=ny1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/09/12/jury-selection-begins-in-re-trial-of-man-accused-of-killing-etan-patz.html |title=Jury Selection Begins in Re-Trial of Man Accused of Killing Etan Patz |first=Michael |last=Herzenberg |work=NY1 News |date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case reopened==

Manhattan District Attorney [[Cyrus Vance, Jr.]] officially reopened the case on May 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Manhattan D.A.

This residence had been newly refurbished shortly after Etan's disappearance in 1979, and the basement had been the workshop and storage space of a handyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/nyregion/etan-patz-inquiry-returns-to-a-prince-street-basement-and-an-old-handyman.html |title=Search for Boy's Body Returns to Cellar That Looked Uneven Decades Earlier |last1=Baker |first1=Al |last2=Rashbaum |first2=William K. |date=April 20, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a four-day search, investigators announced that there was "nothing conclusive found."&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/22/etan-patz-search-nothing-conclusive-found_n_1444466.html |title=Etan Patz Search: Investigators Looking For Clues In Boy's 1979 Disappearance Find 'Nothing Conclusive' In New York Basement |last1=Nichols |first1=Michelle |last2=Allen |first2=Jonathan |date=April 22, 2012 |agency=Reuters|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confession===
On May 24, 2012, New York Police Commissioner [[Raymond Kelly]] announced that a man was in custody who had implicated himself in Etan's disappearance.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |last=Candiotti |first=Susan |date=May 24, 2012 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/24/justice/new-york-etan-patz/ |title=Man in custody in 1979 Etan Patz case|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', a law enforcement official identified the man as 51-year-old Pedro Hernandez of [[Maple Shade Township, New Jersey|Maple Shade, New Jersey]], and said that he had confessed to strangling the child.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rashbaum |first1=William K. |first2=Joseph |last2=Goldstein |date=May 24, 2011 |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/man-claims-role-in-disappearance-of-etan-patz-police-say/ |title=Man Confesses to Strangling Etan Patz, Police Say |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated in his written confession to police, "I’m sorry, I shoke [sic] him."&lt;ref name="New York Post"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2012/05/25/etan-patz-killer-charged-with-second-degree-murder-in-hospital-arraignment/|title=Etan Patz ‘killer’ charged with second-degree murder in hospital arraignment|date=2012-05-25|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2009 book about the case, ''[[After Etan]]'', Etan had a dollar and had told his parents he planned to buy a soda to drink with his lunch.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; At the time of Etan's disappearance, Hernandez was an 18-year-old [[convenience store]] worker in a neighborhood [[Convenience store|bodega]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldstein |first1=Joseph |last2=Rashbaum |first2=William K. |date=May 24, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/nyregion/man-claims-he-strangled-etan-patz-police-say.html |title=After 33 Years, Police Make Arrest in Case of Etan Patz |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez said that he later threw Etan's remains into the garbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Celona |first1=Larry |last2=Margolin |first2=Josh |date=May 24, 2012 |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/person_in_custody_in_patz_disappearance_eEcUgDAqlekvwMV0B4QMyJ |title=Person in Custody In Patz Disappearance |newspaper=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez was charged with second-degree murder.&lt;ref name="New York Post"/&gt;  According to a ''New York Times'' report from May 25, 2012, the police at that time had no physical evidence to corroborate his confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rashbaum |first1=William K. |first2=Gregory |last2=Kia |date=May 25, 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/26/nyregion/suspect-in-etan-patz-case-charged-with-second-degree-murder.html |title=At Arraignment in Etan Patz Case, Mental Illness Claim |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corroborating evidence===
In 2012 a man from New Jersey, Jose Lopez, reached out to investigators: He believed that Hernandez, Lopez's brother-in-law, was in fact responsible for Etan's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite News|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/nyregion/what-happened-to-etan-patz.html |title=What Happened to Etan Patz?

According to Hernandez's sister, it was an "open family secret that he had confessed in the church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/nyregion/worshiper-recalls-admission-by-patz-suspect-decades-ago.html |title=Worshiper Recalls Admission by Patz Suspect Decades Ago |first1=Michael |last1=Wilson |first2=Kia |last2=Gregory |first3=Nate |last3=Schweber |date=May 27, 2012 |accessdate=May 30, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A New York [[grand jury]] indicted Hernandez on November 14, 2012, on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping.&lt;ref name=nbc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Etan-Patz-Suspect-Pedro-Hernandez-Grand-Jury-Charges-Indictment-179304281.html |title=Etan Patz Suspect Indicted on Murder, Kidnapping Charges |first1=Jonathan |last1=Dienst|first2=Shimon |last2=Prokupecz|work=[[NBC]] New York |date=November 14, 2012 |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lawyer has stated that Hernandez was diagnosed with [[schizotypal personality disorder]], which includes [[hallucination]]s.&lt;ref name=nbc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Killer-of-first-milk-carton-boy-formally-charged/tabid/417/articleID/276798/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ| title= Killer of first 'milk carton' boy formally charged| first1 = Jennifer | last1 = Peltz | first2 = Tom | last2 = Hayes | date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyer has also said his client has a low [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) of around 70, "at the border of intellectual disability."&lt;ref name=MSN-2014.09.14/&gt;

===Trials and conviction===
On December 12, 2012, Hernandez pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder and one count of kidnapping in a New York court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Etan Patz murder suspect pleads not guilty |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/12/justice/new-york-etan-patz-pedro-hernandez/ | first = David | last = Ariosto | date = December 13, 2012 | work=CNN |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, Harvey Fishbein, Hernandez's [[legal aid]] criminal defense lawyer, filed a motion to dismiss the case, citing that Hernandez's "confession in one of the nation's most notorious child disappearances was false, peppered with questionable claims and made after almost seven hours of police questioning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/pedro-hernandez-etan-patz_n_3105116.html | work= Huffington Post| title= Pedro Hernandez's Lawyer Asks Court To Toss Etan Patz Killing Confession | first = Jennifer | last = Peltz | date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, however, [[New York Supreme Court]] Justice Maxwell Wiley ruled that the evidence was "legally sufficient to support the charges" and that the case could move forward. He also ordered a hearing to determine whether the defendant's statements could be used at trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/15/pedro-hernandez-etan-patz-murder-case-trial_n_3278117.html | work= Huffington Post| title= Pedro Hernandez, Charged With Murder Of Etan Patz, To Face Trial | first = Jennifer | last = Peltz | date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hernandez had a hearing in September 2014 about whether his statements made prior to police giving him his [[Miranda warning|Miranda rights]] were legally admissible at trial. This would be influenced by whether or not he felt free to leave during the time before he was informed of his Miranda rights. The hearing was also to determine whether or not he understood the significance of the Miranda rights and was competent to waive them when he did so.

==Aftermath==

In 1983, the May 25 anniversary of Etan Patz's disappearance was designated [[National Missing Children's Day]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=AbdChanged/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helpbringthemhome.org.au/ "May 25 – International Missing Children's Day"], Help Bring Them Home&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojjdp.gov/programs/postercontest/ "National Missing Children's Day"], Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the tribute spread worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=13375 "International Missing Childrens Day May 25, 2014"], An Garda Síochána, May 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=241279&amp;Cat=5&amp;dt=5/28/2010 |title=Missing Children's Day passes unnoticed |date=May 26, 2010 |work=The News International, Pakistan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209084614/http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=241279&amp;Cat=5&amp;dt=5%2F28%2F2010 |archivedate=December 9, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] (ICMEC) coordinates the "Help Bring Them Home" campaign in 22 countries in conjunction with International Missing Children's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingpersons.gov.au/awareness/campaigns/youthchildrens-day.aspx |title=Missing Persons: International Missing Children's Day: May 25 |publisher=Australian Federal Police |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206213340/http://www.missingpersons.gov.au/awareness/campaigns/youthchildrens-day.aspx |archivedate=December 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstalk.ie/Today-marks-International-Missing-Childrens-Day|title=Today marks International Missing Children's Day; It is estimated 8 million children are reported missing each year|first=Jack|last=Quann|date=May 25, 2014|work=newstalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grreporter.info/en/2012_311_children_went_missing_greece/9354|title=In 2012, 311 children went missing in Greece|publisher=GR Reporter|date=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to5Q_S8t-3A "Missing Children Day May 25, 2011"], YouTube (video), DontYouForgetAboutMe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&amp;PageId=5055 " Countries around the world honor International Missing Children's Day on May 25"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214143407/http://icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&amp;PageId=5055 |date=December 14, 2014 }}, ICMEC&lt;/ref&gt;

The extensive media attention given to Etan's disappearance has been credited with creating greater attention to missing children, resulting in changes such as less willingness to allow children to walk to school, photos of missing children being printed on milk cartons, and promotion of the concept of "[[stranger danger]]", the idea that all adults not known to the child must be regarded as potential sources of danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/03/hey-parents-leave-those-kids-alone/358631/ |title=The Overprotected Kid |author=Rosin, Hanna |date=March 19, 2014 |magazine=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Essentialism''' is the view that every [[entity]] has a set of attributes that are necessary to its [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Richard L.|title=Some Remarks on Essentialism|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|year=1968|volume=65|issue=20|pages=615–626|jstor=2024315|doi=10.2307/2024315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Western thought [[Platonic idealism|Plato's idealism]] held that all things have such an "essence"—an [[Theory of Forms|"idea" or "form"]]. In [[Categories (Aristotle)|''Categories'']], Aristotle similarly proposed that all objects have a [[Substance theory|substance]] that, as [[George Lakoff]] put it "make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not ''that'' kind of thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Janicki|2003|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contrary view—[[non-essentialism]]—denies the need to posit such an "essence'".

Essentialism has been controversial from its beginning. Plato, in the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides Dialogue]]'', depicts Socrates questioning the notion, suggesting that if we accept the idea that every beautiful thing or just action partakes of an essence to be beautiful or just, we must also accept the "existence of separate essences for hair, mud, and dirt" .&lt;ref name="platostanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-parmenides/|title=Plato's Parmenides|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biology and other natural sciences, essentialism provided the rationale for [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] at least until the time of [[Charles Darwin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ereshefsky|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the role and importance of essentialism in biology is still a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hull|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[gender studies]] the essentialist idea that men and women are fundamentally different continues to be a matter of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Women and Men|publisher=Basic Books|year=1992|isbn=978-0465047925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"&gt;Suzanne Kelly, Gowri Parameswaran, and Nancy Schniedewind, ''Women: Images &amp; Realities: A Multicultural Anthology'', 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
An ''[[essence]]'' characterizes a [[substance theory|substance]] or a [[Substantial form|form]], in the sense of the forms and ideas in [[Platonic idealism]]. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal, is and present in every possible world. Classical [[humanism]] has an essentialist conception of the human, in its endorsement of the notion of an eternal and unchangeable [[human nature]]. This has been criticized by [[Kierkegaard]], [[Marx]], [[Heidegger]], [[Sartre]], and many other [[Existentialism|existential]] and [[Historical materialism|materialist]] thinkers.

In [[Plato]]'s philosophy (in particular, the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and the ''[[Philebus]]''), things were said to come into being by the action of a [[demiurge]] who works to form [[substance theory|chaos]] into ordered entities. Many definitions of ''essence'' hark back to the ancient Greek [[hylomorphic]] understanding of the formation of the things. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artefact produced by a craftsperson. The craftsperson requires ''hyle'' (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in her own mind, according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (''morphe''). Aristotle was the first to use the terms ''hyle'' and ''morphe''. According to [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|his explanation]], all entities have two aspects: "matter" and "form". It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity—its [[quiddity]] or "whatness" (i.e., its "what it is").

Plato was one of the first essentialists, postulating the concept of ideal forms—an [[abstract entity]] of which individual objects are mere facsimiles. To give an example: the ideal form of a circle is a perfect circle, something that is physically impossible to make manifest; yet the circles we draw and observe clearly have some ''idea'' in common—the ideal form. Plato proposed that these ideas are eternal and vastly superior to their manifestations, and that we understand these manifestations in the material world by comparing and relating them to their respective ideal form. Plato's forms are regarded as patriarchs to essentialist dogma simply because they are a case of what is intrinsic and a-contextual of objects—the abstract properties that makes them what they are. (For more on forms, read [[Plato's allegory of the cave|Plato's parable of the cave]].)

[[Karl Popper]] splits the ambiguous term ''[[Philosophical realism|realism]]'' into ''essentialism'' and ''realism''. He uses ''essentialism'' whenever he means the opposite of [[nominalism]], and ''realism'' only as opposed to [[idealism]]. Popper himself is a realist as opposed to an idealist, but a methodological nominalist as opposed to an essentialist. For example, statements like "a puppy is a young dog" should be read from right to left, as an answer to "What shall we call a young dog"; never from left to right as an answer to "What is a puppy?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysical essentialism===
Essentialism, in its broadest sense, is any philosophy that acknowledges the primacy of ''essence''. Unlike [[existentialism]], which posits "being" as the fundamental reality, the essentialist [[wikt:ontology|ontology]] must be approached from a metaphysical perspective. Empirical knowledge is developed from experience of a relational universe whose components and attributes are defined and measured in terms of intellectually constructed laws. Thus, for the scientist, reality is explored as an evolutionary system of diverse entities, the order of which is determined by the principle of causality.

[[Plato]] believed that the universe was perfect and that its observed imperfections came from man's limited perception of it. For Plato, there were two realities: the "essential" or ideal and the "perceived". [[Aristotle]] (384–322 B.C.) applied the term ''essence'' to that which things in a category have in common and without which they cannot be members of that category (for example, ''rationality'' is the essence of man; without rationality a creature cannot be a man). In his critique of Aristotle's philosophy, [[Bertrand Russell]] said that his concept of essence transferred to metaphysics what was only a verbal convenience and that it confused the properties of language with the properties of the world. In fact, a thing's "essence" consisted in those defining properties without which we could not use the ''name'' for it.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concept of essence was "hopelessly muddled" it became part of every philosophy until modern times.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt;

The Egyptian-born philosopher [[Plotinus]] (204–270 CE) brought [[idealism]] to the [[Roman Empire]] as [[Neoplatonism]], and with it the concept that not only do all existents emanate from a "primary essence" but that the mind plays an active role in shaping or ordering the objects of perception, rather than passively receiving empirical data.

Despite the metaphysical basis for the term, academics in science, [[aesthetics]], [[heuristics]], [[psychology]], and gender-based sociological studies have advanced their causes under the banner of essentialism. Possibly the clearest definition for this philosophy was offered by gay/lesbian rights advocate [[Diana Fuss]], who wrote: "Essentialism is most commonly understood as a belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the 'whatness' of a given entity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fuss|2013|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysical essentialism stands diametrically opposed to existential realism in that finite existence is only differentiated appearance, whereas "ultimate reality" is held to be absolute essence.

Among contemporary essentialists, what all existing things have in common is ''the power to exist'', which defines their "uncreated" Essence.&lt;ref&gt;Levina, Tatiana (Moscow 2013) Realism in Metaphysics: Analytic Questions and Continental Answers (p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==
In 2010, an article by [[Gerald B. Folland]] in the ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'' stated, "It is a truth universally acknowledged that almost all mathematicians are Platonists, at least when they are actually doing mathematics …" This refers to their implicit embrace of essentialism, which he finds revealed in mathematicians peculiar use of language. Whereas physicists define [[Lie algebra]] as a rule they can apply to facts, mathematicians define it as an essence of a structure, independent of any circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/201009/rtx100901121p.pdf Gerald B. Folland, October 2010, Notices of the AMS, p. 1121 "Speaking with the Natives: Reﬂections on Mathematical Communication"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==
[[File:Toronto Maple Leafs bild.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] attempts to explain why people will pay more in an auction for the clothing of celebrities if the clothing is unwashed. He believes the answer to this and many other questions is that people cannot help but think of objects as containing a sort of "essence" that can be influenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_the_origins_of_pleasure.html Paul Bloom, July 2011 Ted talk, "The Origins of Pleasure"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There is a difference between metaphysical essentialism (see above) and psychological essentialism, the latter referring not to an actual claim about the world but a claim about a way of representing entities in cognitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medin|first=D. L.|title=Conceptes and conceptual structure|journal=American Psychologist|year=1989|volume=44|issue=12|pages=1469–1481|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.44.12.1469}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Medin, 1989). Influential in this area is [[Susan Gelman]], who has outlined many domains in which children and adults construe classes of entities, particularly biological entities, in essentialist terms—i.e., as if they had an immutable underlying essence which can be used to predict unobserved similarities between members of that class.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gelman, S. ''The essential child: Origins of essentialism in everyday thought''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toosi|first=N. R.|author2=Ambady, N.|title=Ratings of essentialism for eight religious identities|journal=International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1080/10508619.2011.532441|pmid=21572550|pmc=3093246}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Toosi &amp; Ambady, 2011). This causal relationship is unidirectional; an observable feature of an entity does not define the underlying essence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dar-Nimrod|first=I.|author2=Heine, S. J.|title=Genetic essentialism: On the deceptive determinism of DNA|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2011|volume=137|issue=5|pages=800–818|doi=10.1037/a0021860|pmid=21142350|pmc=3394457}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, 2011).

===In developmental psychology===
Essentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly [[developmental psychology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gelman|first=S. A.|author2=Kremer, K. E.|title=Understanding natural causes: Children's explanations of how objects and their properties originate|journal=Child Development|year=1991|volume=62|issue=2|pages=396–414|doi=10.2307/1131012|pmid=2055130|jstor=1131012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelman and Kremer (1991) studied the extent to which children from 4–7 years old demonstrate essentialism. Children were able to identify the cause of behaviour in living and non-living objects. Children understood that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Participants could correctly describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects as a result of an adult influencing the object's actions. This is a biological way of representing essential features in cognitions. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rangel|first=U.|author2=Keller, J.|title=Essentialism goes social: Belief in social determinism as a component of psychological essentialism|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=6|pages=1056–1078|doi=10.1037/a0022401|pmid=21319911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rangel and Keller, 2011).
Younger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in [[cognitive development]]. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demoulin|first=Stéphanie|last2=Leyens |first2=Jacques-Philippe |last3=Yzerbyt |first3=Vincent|title=Lay Theories of Essentialism |journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|year=2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=25–42|doi=10.1177/1368430206059856}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Demoulin, Leyens &amp; Yzerbyt, 2006).

There are four key criteria which constitute essentialist thinking. The first facet is the aforementioned individual causal mechanisms (del Rio &amp; Strasser, 2011). The second is innate potential: the assumption that an object will fulfill its predetermined course of development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanovsky|first=M.|title=Essentialism and folksociology: Ethnicity again|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=241–281|doi=10.1163/156853707X208503|citeseerx=10.1.1.411.7247}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kanovsky, 2007). According to this criterion, essences predict developments in entities that will occur throughout its lifespan. The third is immutability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holtz|first=P.|author2=Wagner, W.|title=Essentialism and attribution of monstrosity in racist discourse: Right-wing internet postings about africans and jews|journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=19|issue=6|pages=411–425|doi=10.1002/casp.1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Holtz &amp; Wagner, 2009). Despite altering the superficial appearance of an object it does not remove its essence. Observable changes in features of an entity are not salient enough to alter its essential characteristics. The fourth is inductive potential&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birnbaum|first=D.|author2=Deeb, I. |author3=Segall, G. |author4=Ben-Eliyahu, A. |author5=Diesendruck, G. |title=The development of social essentialism: The case of Israeli children's inferences about Jews and Arabs |journal=Child Development |year=2010 |volume=81|issue=3|pages=757–777|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624-2010.01432.x|pmid=20573103|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Birnbaum, Deeb, Segall, Ben-Aliyahu &amp; Diesendruck, 2010). This suggests that entities may share common features but are essentially different. However similar two beings may be, their characteristics will be at most analogous, differing most importantly in essences.

The implications of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals have been found to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=T. A.|author2=Hornsey, M. J. |author3=Postmes, T. |title=Shifting ground: The variable use of essentialism in contexts of inclusion and exclusion|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=48|issue=1|pages=35–59|doi=10.1348/014466607X270287|pmid=18171502}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Morton, Hornsey &amp; Postmes, 2009).

==In ethics==
Classical essentialists claim that some things are wrong in an absolute sense. For example murder breaks a universal, objective and natural moral law and not merely an advantageous, socially or ethically constructed one.

Many modern essentialists claim that right and wrong are moral boundaries that are individually constructed; in other words, things that are ethically right or wrong are actions that the individual deems to be beneficial or harmful, respectively.

==In biology==

One possibility is that before [[evolution]] was developed as a [[scientific theory]], there existed an essentialist view of [[biology]] that posited all species to be unchanging throughout time. The historian Mary P. Winsor has argued that biologists such as [[Louis Agassiz]] in the 19th century believed that taxa such as species and genus were fixed, reflecting the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowler |first1=Peter J. |title=Evolution. The History of an Idea |date=1989 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-06386-0 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[creation-evolution controversy|religious opponents of evolution]] continue to maintain this view of biology.

Recent work by historians of [[systematics|systematic biology]] has, however, cast doubt upon this view of pre-Darwinian thinkers. Winsor, Ron Amundson and Staffan Müller-Wille have each argued that in fact the usual suspects (such as [[Linnaeus]] and the Ideal Morphologists) were very far from being essentialists, and it appears that the so-called "essentialism story" (or "myth") in biology is a result of conflating the views expressed by philosophers from [[Aristotle]] onwards through to [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[William Whewell]] in the immediately pre-Darwinian period, using biological examples, with the use of terms in biology like species.&lt;ref&gt;Amundson, R.

== Gender essentialism ==
{{main|Gender essentialism}}

In [[feminist theory]] and [[gender studies]], '''gender essentialism''' is the attribution of a fixed essence to women. Women's essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These ideas of femininity are usually biologized and are often preoccupied with psychological characteristics, such as nurturance, empathy, support, and non-competitiveness, etc. Feminist theorist [[Elizabeth Grosz]] states in her 1995 publication ''Space, time and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies'' that essentialism "entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women's essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change—it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization."&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Grosz|first1 = Elizabeth|title =Space, Time, and Perversion: Essays on the Politics of Bodies |date = 1995|publisher = Routledge|location = New York|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Space_Time_and_Perversion.html?id=Htf7y-rcVFwC |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 March 2017|isbn = 9780415911375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender essentialism is pervasive in popular culture, as illustrated by the #1 ''New York Times'' best seller ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus'', HarperCollins, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; but this essentialism is routinely critiqued in introductory women studies textbooks such as ''Women: Images &amp; Realities''.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"/&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, some feminist writers have put forward essentialist theories about gender and science. [[Evelyn Fox Keller]],&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Fox Keller, ''Reflections on Gender and Science'', Yale University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Harding]],
&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Harding, ''The Science Question in Feminism'', Cornell University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nancy Tuana]]
&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Tuana, ''The Less Noble Sex'', Indiana University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the modern scientific enterprise is inherently patriarchal and incompatible with women's nature.  Other feminist scholars, such as [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "A historian looks at gender and science," ''International Journal of Science Education'', vol. 9 (1987), p. 399-407.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenore Blum]],&lt;ref&gt;Lenore Blum, "AWM's first twenty years: The presidents' perspectives," in Bettye Anne Case and Anne M. Leggett, eds., ''Complexities: Women in Mathematics'', Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Gray (scholar)|Mary Gray]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Gray, "Gender and mathematics: Mythology and Misogyny," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Beth Ruskai,&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Ruskai, "Why women are discouraged from becoming scientists," ''The Scientist'', March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram&lt;ref&gt;Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram, "Introduction," ''Uneasy Careers and Intimate Lives: Women in Science, 1789-1979'', Rutgers University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized those theories for ignoring the diverse nature of scientific research and the tremendous variation in women's experiences in different cultures and historical periods.

== In historiography ==
Essentialism in history as a field of study entails discerning and listing essential cultural characteristics of a particular nation or culture, in the belief that a people or culture can be understood in this way. Sometimes such essentialism leads to claims of a praiseworthy national or cultural identity, or to its opposite, the condemnation of a culture based on presumed essential characteristics. [[Herodotus]], for example, claims that Egyptian culture is essentially feminized and possesses a "softness" which has made Egypt easy to conquer.&lt;ref&gt;DeLapp 177.&lt;/ref&gt; To what extent Herodotus was an essentialist is a matter of debate; he is also credited with not essentializing the concept of the Athenian identity,&lt;ref&gt;Lape 149-52.&lt;/ref&gt; or differences between the Greeks and the Persians that are the subject of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentialism had been operative in [[colonialism]] as well as in critiques of colonialism.

[[Postcolonialism|Post-colonial]] theorists such as [[Edward Said]] insisted that essentialism was the "defining mode" of "Western" historiography and ethnography until the nineteenth century and even after, according to [[Touraj Atabaki]], manifesting itself in the historiography of the Middle East and Central Asia as [[Eurocentrism]], over-generalization, and reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians reject essentialism because it "dehistoricizes the process of social and cultural changes" and tends to see non-Western societies as historically unchanging; in India this led to the anti-essentialist (even anti-historiographical) school of [[Subaltern Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7254">'''Flavr Savr''' (also known as '''CGN-89564-2'''; pronounced "flavor saver"), a [[genetically modified tomato]], was the first commercially grown [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] food to be granted a license for human consumption. It was produced by the Californian company [[Calgene]], and submitted to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Redenbaugh, Keith, Bill Hiatt, Belinda Martineau, Matthew Kramer, Ray Sheehy, Rick Sanders, Cathy Houck and Don Emlay|year=1992|title=Safety Assessment of Genetically Engineered Fruits and Vegetables: A Case Study of the Flavr Savr Tomato|publisher=CRC Press|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Brad|title=The Flavr Savr Arrives|url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BA/Flavr_Savr_Arrives.php|accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the FDA completed its evaluation of the Flavr Savr tomato and the use of APH(3')II, concluding that the tomato "is as safe as tomatoes bred by conventional means" and "that the use of aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase II is safe for use as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, [[rapeseed oil]], and cotton intended for food use." It was first sold in 1994, and was only available for a few years before production ceased in 1997.&lt;ref name="fray"&gt;Weasel, Lisa H. 2009. ''Food Fray.'' Amacom Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Calgene made history, but mounting costs prevented the company from becoming profitable, and it was eventually acquired by [[Monsanto Company]].

== Characteristics ==

Through genetic engineering, Calgene hoped to slow down the ripening process of the tomato and thus prevent it from softening, while still allowing the tomato to retain its natural colour and flavour.&lt;ref name="fray"/&gt; The tomato was made more resistant to [[Decomposition|rotting]] by adding an [[antisense]] [[gene]] which interferes with the production of the [[enzyme]] [[polygalacturonase]]. The enzyme normally degrades [[pectin]] in the [[plant cell wall|cell wall]]s and results in the softening of fruit which makes them more susceptible to being damaged by [[fungal]] infections. Some unmodified tomatoes are picked before fully ripened and are then artificially ripened using [[ethylene]] gas which acts as a [[plant hormone]]. Picking the fruit while unripe allows for easier handling and extended shelf-life. Flavr Savr tomatoes, on the other hand, could be allowed to [[Ripening|ripen]] on the [[vine]], without compromising their shelf-life. The intended effect of slowing down the softening of Flavr Savr tomatoes would allow the vine-ripe fruits to be harvested like green tomatoes without greater damage to the tomato itself. The Flavr Savr turned out to disappoint researchers in that respect, as the antisensed PG gene had a positive effect on shelf life, but not on the fruit's firmness, so the tomatoes still had to be harvested like any other unmodified vine-ripe tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;Martineau, Belinda. 2001. ''First Fruit: The Creation of the Flavr Savr Tomato and the Birth of Biotech Food''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; An improved flavor, later achieved through traditional breeding of Flavr Savr and better tasting varieties, would also contribute to selling Flavr Savr at a premium price at the supermarket.

The FDA stated that special labeling for these modified tomatoes was not necessary because they have the essential characteristics of non-modified tomatoes. Specifically, there was no evidence for health risks, and the nutritional content was unchanged.&lt;ref name="fray"/&gt;

The failure of the Flavr Savr has been attributed to Calgene's inexperience in the business of growing and shipping tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Dan. 2001. ''Lords of The Harvest''. Perseus Publishing. 144-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tomato paste ==

In the UK, [[Zeneca]] produced a tomato paste that used technology similar to the Flavr Savr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Center for Environmental Risk Assessment|title=GM Crop Database:Tomato|publisher=International Life Sciences Institute|url=http://cera-gmc.org/index.php?evidcode=&amp;hstIDXCode=11&amp;gType=&amp;AbbrCode=&amp;atCode=&amp;stCode=&amp;coIDCode=&amp;action=gm_crop_database&amp;mode=Submit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Grierson (geneticist)|Don Grierson]] was involved in the research to make the genetically modified tomato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=108313&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=A puree genius at his work |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=1998-07-17 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the characteristics of the tomato, it was cheaper to produce than conventional tomato paste, resulting in the product being 20% cheaper. Between 1996 and 1999, 1.8 million cans, clearly labelled as genetically engineered, were sold in the major [[supermarket]] chains [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Safeway UK]]. At one point the paste outsold normal tomato paste but sales fell in the autumn of 1998.

The [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] published a report in which they stated that the decline in sales during this period was linked to changing consumer perceptions of genetically modified crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=House of Commons Science |author2=Technology Committee | title = Scientific Advisory System: Genetically Modified Foods | date=May 18, 1999 | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmsctech/286/28605.htm | accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report identified several possible factors, including product labeling and perception of choice, lobbying campaigns, and media attention. It concluded that the tone of media reports on the subject underwent a "fundamental shift" in response to a high-profile incident in which Dr. [[Arpad Pusztai]], a researcher for Rowett Research Institute, was fired after making a televised claim about detrimental health effects in lab rats fed a diet of genetically modified potatoes (see the [[Pusztai affair]]). Subsequent peer review and testimony by Dr. Pusztai led the House Science and Technology Select Committee to conclude that his initial claim was "contradicted by his own evidence." In the intervening period, Sainsbury's and Safeway both pledged that none of their house brand products would contain genetically modified ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucanr.org/repository/CAO/landingpage.cfm?article=ca.v054n04p6&amp;fulltext=yes The case of the FLAVR SAVR tomato] G.

'''George McInvale Grant''' (July 11, 1897 – November 4, 1982) was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[US House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Alabama]].

==Early life==
Grant was born in [[Louisville, Alabama]]. He obtained a law degree from [[University of Alabama]] in 1922. He was [[admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] the same year and opened a law practice in [[Troy, Alabama]], near [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].

He was a private and aviation cadet in the aviation section of the Signal Corps of the [[United States Army]] in 1918 and 1919. He was county solicitor ([[district attorney]]) of [[Pike County, Alabama]] from 1927 to 1937.

==Political career==
When Representative [[Lister Hill]] was appointed to the [[US Senate]] in 1938, Grant won the Democratic nomination to succeed him in the special election. Then, Democratic nomination was [[tantamount to election]] in Alabama, and he took office on June 14. He won a full term that November and was reelected 11 more times from the Montgomery-based district. In 1957, he voted against the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/85-1957/h42&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Grant faced his first credible opponent in the Democratic primary when former [[Rear Admiral]] [[John G. Crommelin]] challenged him. Crommelin ran well to Grant's right, giving speeches full of [[racism|racist]] and [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] rhetoric. Grant managed to fend him off, but in November, he faced a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for the first time ever in [[William Louis Dickinson]]. Grant lost by a shocking 25-point margin, which was all the more remarkable since most of the district's living residents had never been represented by a Republican. However, most of the 2nd's residents turned against the Democrats because of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], a major factor behind [[Barry Goldwater]] carrying the state that year. The 2nd District remained in Republican hands until 2008 and regained it in 2010.

==Later life==
Grant returned to his law practice in Troy, but later moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] and became a lobbyist. He lived in Washington until the time of his death on November 4, 1982, at sea, aboard the Queen Elizabeth II. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery, [[Arlington, Virginia]].

&lt;!-- Genre according to references cited --&gt;
'''''Gravity''''' is a 2013 [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[thriller film]] directed, co-written, co-edited, and produced by [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. It stars [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[George Clooney]] as American [[astronaut]]s who are stranded in [[outer space|space]] after the mid-orbit destruction of their [[space shuttle]], and their subsequent attempt to return to [[Earth]].

Cuarón wrote the screenplay with his son [[Jonás Cuarón|Jonás]] and attempted to develop the film at [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. Later, the distribution rights were acquired by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. [[David Heyman]], who previously worked with Cuarón on ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004), produced the film with him. ''Gravity'' was produced entirely in the [[United Kingdom]], where British [[visual effects]] company [[Framestore]] spent more than three years creating most of the film's visual effects, which make up over 80 of its 91 minutes.

''Gravity'' opened the [[70th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 28, 2013 and had its North American premiere three days later at the [[Telluride Film Festival]]. Upon its release, ''Gravity'' was met with critical acclaim. Particular praise was given to [[Emmanuel Lubezki]]'s cinematography, [[Steven Price (composer)|Steven Price]]'s musical score, Cuarón's direction, Bullock's performance, [[Framestore]]'s visual effects, and its use of [[3D film|3D]]. Considered one of the best films of 2013, it appeared on numerous critics' year-end lists, and was selected by the [[American Film Institute]] in their annual ''Movies of the Year'' list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hammond |first=Pete|url=http://deadline.com/2013/12/afi-awards-2013-film-winners-full-list-649223/ |title=AFI Awards 2013: Top 10 Films List Is Good News For Major Studios |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=December 9, 2013 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film became the [[2013 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth highest-grossing film of 2013]] with a worldwide gross of over $723 million, against a production budget of $100 million.

The film earned accolades from numerous critics and guilds. At the [[86th Academy Awards]], ''Gravity'' received ten nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Bullock and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won seven awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. The film was also awarded six [[BAFTA Awards]], including [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film|Outstanding British Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]], seven [[Critics' Choice Movie Award]]s, and the 2013 [[Ray Bradbury Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfwa.org/2014/02/2013-nebula-nominees-announced/ 2013 Nebula Nominees Announced], SFWA, Feb 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!--- PLOTS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400–700 WORDS PER [[WP:FILMPLOT]] ---&gt;
[[NASA]] Space Shuttle ''Explorer'', commanded by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, is in Earth [[orbit]] on mission STS-157 to service the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Dr. Ryan Stone is aboard on her first space mission as a mission specialist, her job being to perform a set of hardware upgrades on the Hubble. During a [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]], [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in [[Houston]] warns ''Explorer's'' crew about a Russian [[Anti-satellite weapon|missile strike on a defunct satellite]], which has inadvertently caused a [[Kessler syndrome|chain reaction]] forming a rapidly-expanding cloud of [[space debris]], ordering the crew to return to Earth immediately. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter as more and more communication satellites are knocked out by the debris.

High-speed debris strikes the ''Explorer'' and Hubble, tearing Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]] (MMU), rescues Stone, and they return to the ''Explorer'', soon discovering that the Shuttle has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew are dead. Stone and Kowalski decide to use the MMU to reach the [[International Space Station]], which is in orbit about {{convert|900|mi||-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} away, Kowalski estimating that they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again.

On their way to the International Space Station (ISS), the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the station, they see that the ISS's crew has evacuated into one of its two [[Soyuz-TMA|Soyuz spacecraft]], the remaining Soyuz's parachute being prematurely deployed, rendering it unable to return to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese space station ''[[Tiangong program|Tiangong]]'', {{convert|100|km|-1|abbr=on}} away, in order to board its [[Shenzhou spacecraft]] and return safely to Earth in the re-entry [[space capsule|capsule]]. Out of air and maneuvering fuel, the two try to grab onto the ISS; Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite Stone's protests, Kowalski detaches himself from the tether to save her from drifting away with him. Stone is pulled back towards the ISS, while Kowalski floats away.

Stone enters the space station via the [[airlock]] of the [[Pirs Docking Compartment]]. She cannot re-establish communication with Kowalski nor Earth and concludes that she is now the sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing her to rush to the Soyuz. As she maneuvers the Soyuz away from the ISS, the tangled parachute tethers snag, preventing the spacecraft from leaving; Stone performs a spacewalk to cut the cables, succeeding just as the debris field returns, destroying the station. Stone angles the Soyuz towards ''Tiangong'', but soon discovers that the Soyuz's engine has no fuel.

After a poignant attempt at radio communication with an [[Eskimo]] on Earth, Stone resigns herself to her fate and shuts down the cabin's oxygen supply to commit suicide. As she begins to lose [[consciousness]], Kowalski enters the capsule, scolding her for giving up. He tells her to rig the Soyuz's [[Retrorocket|soft landing rockets]] to propel the capsule toward ''Tiangong'' before disappearing. Realizing Kowalski's appearance was a hallucination, Stone regains the will to go on, restoring the spacecraft's oxygen flow and rigging the landing rockets to propel the capsule towards ''Tiangong''.

Unable to dock with Tiangong, Stone ejects herself from the Soyuz and uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel to the rapidly deorbiting ''Tiangong''. Stone manages to enter ''Tiangong's'' Shenzhou spacecraft just as the station enters the upper [[atmosphere]], unlocking its re-entry capsule just in time.

The [[Shenzhou (spacecraft)|''Shenzhou'']] capsule re-enters the atmosphere successfully; however, during the descent it is damaged by debris from the disintegrating Tiangong and a fire starts inside the capsule. The capsule lands in a lake, but dense smoke forces Stone to evacuate immediately after [[splashdown]], shedding her spacesuit and swimming ashore. Stone shakily takes her first steps back on land.

== Themes ==
Although ''Gravity'' is often referred to in the media as a science fiction film,&lt;ref name="Reelviews-20131003"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2670 | title=Gravity – A Movie Review | work=[[ReelViews]] | date=October 3, 2013 | accessdate=October 7, 2013 | last=Berardinelli | first=James | authorlink=James Berardinelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuarón told [[BBC]] that he sees the film rather as "a drama of a woman in space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26381335 | title=Oscars: Gravity 'not sci-fi', says Alfonso Cuaron | publisher=BBC | date=February 28, 2014 | accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the main theme of the film was "adversity"&lt;ref name="TG"/&gt; and he uses the debris as a metaphor for this.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

Despite being set in space, the film uses motifs from shipwreck and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience in the aftermath of a catastrophe.&lt;ref name="Seitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gravity-2013 |last=Zoller Seitz |first=Matt |date=October 4, 2013 |title=Review: Gravity |publisher=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodriguez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hornaday"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/gravity-works-as-both-thrilling-sci-fi-spectacle-and-brilliant-high-art/2013/10/02/cffa11bc-2a03-11e3-97a3-ff2758228523_story.html |title="Gravity" works as both thrilling sci-fi spectacle and brilliant high art |last=Hornaday |first=Ann |date=October 3, 2013 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/movies/gravity-stars-sandra-bullock-and-george-clooney.html |title=Between Earth and Heaven |last=Scott |first=A.O. |date=October 3, 2013 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless [[Murphy's law]].&lt;ref name="Reelviews-20131003" /&gt; The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.com/039gravity039-pg-13-article |title=Gravity |work=The Miami Herald |date=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Gravity-review-powerful-images-and-drama-4866080.php|title="Gravity" review: powerful images – and drama |last=LaSalle |first=Mick |date= October 4, 2013|work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of scenes is heightened by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives, the warm face of the Earth and the depths of dark space, the chaos and unpredictability of the debris field, and silence in the vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/gravity/review/615139 |title=Gravity: Venice Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film uses very long, uninterrupted shots throughout to draw the audience into the action, but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-gravity-movie-review-20131004,0,4375763.story? |title=Review: "Gravity" has powerful pull thanks to Sandra Bullock, 3-D |work=Los Angeles Times |last=Turan |first=Kenneth |date= October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human [[evolution]] and the resilience of life may also be seen as key themes of ''Gravity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woerner|first=Meredith|title=Gravity's ending holds a deeper meaning, says Alfonso Cuaron|url=http://io9.com/gravitys-ending-holds-a-deeper-meaning-says-alfonso-c-1442690788|publisher=io9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="giantfreakinrobot.com"&gt;[http://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/scifi/alfonso-cuarn-talks-gravitys-visual-metaphors-george-clooney-clarifies-writing-credit.html Alfonso Cuarón Talks Gravity’s Visual Metaphors, And George Clooney Clarifies His Writing Credit].

Roger Ebert. Retrieved May 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The film opens with the exploration of space{{mdash}}the vanguard of human civilization{{mdash}}and ends with an [[allegory]] of the dawn of mankind when Dr. Ryan Stone fights her way out of the water after the crash-landing, passing a frog, grabs the soil, and slowly regains her capacity to stand upright and walk. Director Cuarón said, "She's in these murky waters almost like an [[amniotic fluid]] or a [[primordial sea|primordial soup]], in which you see [[amphibians]] swimming. She crawls out of the water, not unlike early creatures in evolution. And then she goes on all fours. And after going on all fours she's a bit curved until she is completely erect. It was the evolution of life in one, quick shot".&lt;ref name="giantfreakinrobot.com" /&gt; Other imagery depicting the formation of life includes a scene in which Stone rests in an [[embryo]]nic position, surrounded by a rope strongly resembling an [[umbilical cord]]. Stone's return from space, accompanied by [[meteorite]]-like debris, may be seen as a hint that elements essential to the development of life on Earth may have come from outer space in the form of meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/weltall/meteorit-sutter-s-mill-lieferte-kohlenstoff-verbindungen-a-921410.html Meteorit Sutter's Mill lieferte Kohlenstoff-Verbindungen - SPIEGEL ONLINE]. Spiegel.de. September 10, 2014. Retrieved May 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
The film also suggests themes of humanity's ubiquitous strategy of [[existential]] resilience; that, across cultures, individuals must postulate meaning, beyond material existence, wherever none can be perceived.

Some commentators have noted possible religious themes in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/08/gravity-film-philosophy_n_4059899.html|title='Gravity' film Philosophizes About Existence for the 'Nones'|first=Jeffrey|last=Weiss|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-reviewers-call-new-film-gravity-an-allegory-for-god-jesus-106290/|title=Christian Reviewers Call New Film 'Gravity' an Allegory for God, Jesus|first=Tyler|last=O'Neil|publisher=Christian Post|date=October 9, 2013|accessdate=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://wordonfire.org/WOF-TV/Commentaries-New/Gravity-A-Commentary-by-Fr-Barron-spoiler-alert.aspx |title=Gravity: A Commentary |first=Robert |last=Barron |date=October 8, 2013 |accessdate=November 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109033805/http://wordonfire.org/WOF-TV/Commentaries-New/Gravity-A-Commentary-by-Fr-Barron-spoiler-alert.aspx |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicregister.org/arts/item/17074-gravity-opens-the-door-to-the-reality-of-god |title=Gravity opens the door to the reality of God |first=Robert |last=Barron |publisher=The Catholic Register |date=October 17, 2013 |accessdate=November 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104201719/http://www.catholicregister.org/arts/item/17074-gravity-opens-the-door-to-the-reality-of-god |archivedate=November 4, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Fr. Robert Barron]] in ''[[The Catholic Register]]'' summarizes the tension between ''Gravity'''s technology and religious symbolism. He said, "The technology which this film legitimately celebrates ... can't save us, and it can't provide the means by which we establish real contact with each other. The [[Ganges]] in the sun, the [[Saint Christopher|St. Christopher]] icon, the statue of [[Budai]], and above all, a visit from a denizen of [[heaven]], signal that there is a dimension of reality that lies beyond what technology can master or access&amp;nbsp; ... &amp;nbsp;the reality of [[God]]".&lt;ref name="barron" /&gt;

At that time his grandmother bought a new color TV in order to be able to see the moon landing that was in black and white.&lt;ref name="THR2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alfonso-cuaron-how-angelina-jolie-681003|title=Alfonso Cuaron on How Angelina Jolie and Robert Downey Jr. Almost Starred in 'Gravity' (Video)|author=Tim Appelo|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=February 18, 2014|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He watched space films like ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' (1902) and was further drawn to films featuring the technology of space exploration, and trying to honor the [[laws of physics]] such as ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'' (1969) and ''[[Woman in the Moon]]'' (1929).&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; After Cuarón and his son, Jonás finished the screenplay, Cuarón attempted to develop his project at [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], where it stayed in development for several years. After the rights to the project were sold, it began development at Warner Bros.&lt;ref name="sandra"/&gt;

===Writing===
Cuarón co-wrote the [[screenplay]] with his son Jonás Cuarón.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/10/center_of_gravity/|title=Why Gravity Director Alfonso Cuarón Will Never Make a Space Movie Again|author=Caitlyn Roaper|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cuarón never intended to make a space film. Before conceiving the story, he started out with a theme; the theme of adversity. He would discuss survival scenarios with Jonás in hostile, isolated locations, such as the desert (Jonás wrote a desert film, ''[[Desierto]]'', which was released in 2015).&lt;ref name="TG"/&gt; Finally, he decided to take it to an extreme place where there's nothing, "I had this image of an astronaut spinning into space away from human communication. The [[metaphor]] was already so obvious."&lt;ref name="TG"/&gt;

===Casting===
For the female lead, no fewer than ten actresses were considered to play the role before finally the choice of [[Sandra Bullock]] in October 2010.&lt;ref name="Casting1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2010/09/angelina-jolie-pass-puts-gravity-in-shaky-orbit-for-warner-bros-64414/|title=Angelina Jolie Pass Puts 'Gravity' In Shaky Orbit For Warner Bros|author=Mike Fleming Jr|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=September 1, 2010|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Angelina Jolie]], who had rejected a sequel to ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'' (2008), was in contact with Warner Bros. to star in the film.&lt;ref name="sandra"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2010/film/news/sandra-bullock-in-talks-for-gravity-1118025288/ | title=Sandra Bullock in talks for 'Gravity' | date=October 6, 2010 | last=Kroll | first=Justin | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/02/angelina_jolie_wanted_2_out.html | title=Angelina Jolie Says No to ''Wanted 2'', Killing the Sequel | work=''Vulture''.

In March, [[Robert Downey Jr.]] entered discussions to be cast in the male lead role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rosenberg | first=Adam | url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/03/15/robert-downey-jr-gravity-alfonso-cuaron/ | title=Robert Downey Jr. In Talks To Star In 'Children of Men' Director Alfonso Cuaron's 'Gravity' | publisher=MTV.

=== Filming ===
[[File:Lake Powell03.jpg|thumb|The landing scene was filmed at [[Lake Powell]], Arizona.]]
Made on a production budget of {{nowrap|$100 million}}, ''Gravity'' was filmed digitally on multiple [[Arri Alexa]] cameras.  [[Computer graphics|CG]] elements were shot at [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] and [[Shepperton Studios]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravity {{!}} Pinewood filming locations|url=http://www.pinewoodgroup.com/production/gravity|work=Pinewood Group|publisher=[[Pinewood Studios]]|accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landing scene was filmed at [[Lake Powell]], Arizona{{mdash}}where the astronauts' landing scene in ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) was also filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What Is The Mind Blowing Connection Between GRAVITY And PLANET OF THE APES? | publisher = badass digest| url = http://badassdigest.com/2013/10/14/what-is-the-mind-blowing-connection-between-gravity-and-planet-of-the-apes/ | accessdate = November 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Principal photography began in London in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dang |first=Simon |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/producer_mark_heyman_says_alfonso_cuarons_gravity_will_shoot_this_may/ |title=Producer David Heyman Says Alfonso Cuarón's 3D Sci-Fi Epic 'Gravity' Will Shoot This May |work=The Playlist |publisher=[[IndieWire]] |date=April 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026122503/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/producer_mark_heyman_says_alfonso_cuarons_gravity_will_shoot_this_may |archivedate=October 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film contains 156 shots, with an average length of 45 seconds{{mdash}}fewer and longer shots than in most films of its length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raup|first=Jordan|title=Alfonso Cuaron's 2-Hour 'Gravity' Revealed; 17-Minute Opening Take Confirmed|url=http://thefilmstage.com/news/average-shot-length-in-alfonso-cuarons-2-hour-gravity-revealed-17-minute-opening-take-confirmed/|publisher=The Film Stage|accessdate=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the first [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] had audible explosions and other sounds, these scenes are silent in the finished film. Cuarón said, "They put in explosions [in the trailer]. As we know, there is no sound in space. In the film, we don't do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Child | first=Ben | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/22/comic-con-2013-five-things-we-learned | title=Comic-Con 2013: five things we learned | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=July 22, 2013 | accessdate=July 22, 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack in the film's space scenes consists of the musical score and sounds astronauts would hear in their suits or in the space vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Observations on film art|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2013/11/12/gravity-part-2-thinking-inside-the-box/|accessdate=November 28, 2014|publisher=davidbordwell.net|date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of Bullock's shots, she was placed inside a giant, mechanical rig.&lt;ref name="Alfonzoreturns" /&gt; Getting into the rig took a significant amount of time, so Bullock chose to stay in it for up to 10 hours a day, communicating with others through a headset.&lt;ref name="Alfonzoreturns" /&gt; Costume Designer Jany Temime said the spacesuits were fictitious – "no space suit opens up at the front – but we had to do that in order for her to get out. So I had to redesign it and readapt all the functions of the suit for front opening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://filmdoctor.co.uk/2015/10/25/spectre-costume-designer-jany-temime-in-conversation/ | title=Spectre and Gravity costume designer Jany Temime in conversation.| work=Film Doctor | date=October 2015 | accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuarón said his biggest challenge was to make the set feel as inviting and non-claustrophobic as possible. The team attempted to do this by having a celebration each day when Bullock arrived. They nicknamed the rig "Sandy's cage" and gave it a lighted sign.&lt;ref name="Alfonzoreturns" /&gt; Most of the film was shot digitally using [[Arri Alexa]] Classics cameras equipped with wide Arri Master Prime lenses. The final scene, which takes place on Earth, was shot on an [[Arri|Arri 765]] camera using [[65mm film]] to provide the sequence with a visual contrast to the rest of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theasc.com/ac_magazine/November2013/Gravity/page2.php | title=Emmanuel Lubezki, ASC, AMC and his collaborators detail their work on Gravity, a technically ambitious drama set in outer space.| work=The American Society of Cinematographers | date=November 2013 | accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting long scenes in a [[Weightlessness|zero-g environment]] was a challenge. Eventually, the team decided to use [[computer-generated imagery]] for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes.&lt;ref name="Alfonzoreturns"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=David S|last2=McNary|first2=David|date=September 3, 2013|title=Alfonso Cuaron Returns to the Bigscreen After Seven Years With 'Gravity'|work=Variety|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/alfonso-cuaron-returns-to-the-bigscreen-after-seven-years-with-gravity-1200596518/|accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed.&lt;ref name="Alfonzoreturns" /&gt; It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took four and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/06/sandra-bullock-pain-gravity-oscars-george-clooney-2014|title=Sandra Bullock: the pain of Gravity|author=Steve Rose|work=the Guardian|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinematography===
[[File:ISS-42 Earth from the ISS.jpg|thumb|The uninterrupted 13 minute opening scene, which started with a clear view of brightly lit [[Earth]] and ended with the destruction of the ''Explorer'', took many months to design and years to shoot.]]

Cuarón wanted to do [[tracking shot]]s, in part because the producers wanted to film it like an [[IMAX]]-style [[Discovery Channel]] documentary.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; Like his previous films, [[Emmanuel Lubezki]] did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on ''Gravity''. Instead, he carried out a search of images from [[NASA]] and [[Roscosmos State Corporation|Roscosmos]]. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the film.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel as deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and [[two dimensional]] feeling.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3807510/behind-the-moving-image-the-cinematography-of-gravity/|title=Behind the Moving Image: The Cinematography of Gravity|author=Paul Moakley|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 28, 2014|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuarón asked Lubezki to start the film with a brightly lit Earth.&lt;ref name="THR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/gravity-cinematographer-emmanuel-lubezki-reveals-680310|title='Gravity' Cinematographer Reveals How He Got Those Astonishing Shots|author=Carolyn Giardina|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scene was challenging for the team to shoot because the light was constantly changing from one frame to the other with the earth and ISS moving, and the sun changing its position all simultaneously. It took many months to design it and years to shoot it.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; When the team designed the sequence, Lubezki had in mind one of his favorite cinematographers, [[Vittorio Storaro]], and how he utilized lighting in his films.&lt;ref name="THR1"/&gt;

===Visual effects===
[[File:Framestore offices London March 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Framestore]] office exterior in London, March 2014, after ''Gravity'' [[BAFTA Award|BAFTA]] wins]]
Visual effects were supervised by [[Tim Webber]] at the London-based VFX company [[Framestore]], which was responsible for creating most of the film's visual effects{{mdash}}except for 17 shots. Framestore was also heavily involved in the art direction and, along with The Third Floor, the [[previsualization]]. Tim Webber stated that 80 percent of the film consisted of CGI{{mdash}}compared to James Cameron's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009), which was 60 percent CGI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framestore.com/work/coming-soon-gravity |title=Gravity |publisher=Framestore |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To simulate the authenticity and reflection of unfiltered light in space, a manually controlled lighting system consisting of 1.8 million individually controlled LED lights was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/10/07/tech-breakthroughs-in-film-from-house-of-wax-to-gravity/|title=Tech Breakthroughs in Film: From House of Wax to Gravity|work=TIME.com|accessdate=November 14, 2014|date=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3D imagery was designed and supervised by Chris Parks. The majority of the 3D was created by [[Stereoscopy|stereo rendering]] the CGI at Framestore. The remaining footage was [[2D to 3D conversion|converted into 3D]] in post-production{{mdash}}principally at Prime Focus, London, with additional conversion work by Framestore. Prime Focus's supervisor was Richard Baker.

Cuarón has stated that ''Gravity'' is not always scientifically accurate and that some liberties were needed to sustain the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravity|publisher=Space.com|url=http://www.space.com/23062-gravity-movie-science-fiction-fact.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is not a documentary," Cuarón said. "It is a piece of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/07/showbiz/movies/gravity-scientists/ |title=5 things that couldn't happen in 'Gravity' |publisher=CNN.com |author=Lisa Respers France|date=October 8, 2013 | accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been praised for the realism of its premises and its overall adherence to physical principles, despite several inaccuracies and exaggerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/bestoftv/2013/09/28/exp-science-behind-gravity.cnn.html|title=What's behind the science of 'Gravity'?|publisher=CNN|date=September 28, 2013|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCLA"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jean-Luc |last=Margot|title=How realistic is 'Gravity'?|url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jlm/epo/gravity.html|publisher=UCLA|date=September 28, 2013|accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScottParazynski"&gt;{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Gwynne|title=An Astronaut Fact-checks Gravity|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/astronaut-fact-checks-gravity.html|publisher=Vulture|accessdate=October 12, 2013|date=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to NASA Astronaut [[Michael J. Massimino]], who took part in Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions [[STS-109]] and [[STS-125]], "nothing was out of place, nothing was missing. There was a one-of-a-kind wirecutter we used on one of my spacewalks and sure enough they had that wirecutter in the movie."&lt;ref name="spacesafetymagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/2013/10/04/gravity-ripped-headlines/|title=Gravity: Ripped from the Headlines?|work=Space Safety Magazine|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] called the visual effects "remarkable", and said, "I was so extravagantly impressed by the portrayal of the reality of zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft."&lt;ref name="Aldrin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gravity-review-by-astronaut-buzz-639883|title='Gravity' Review by Astronaut Buzz Aldrin|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former NASA astronaut [[Garrett Reisman]] said, "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, ''Gravity'' uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly is a testament to the verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/10/17/what-does-a-real-astronaut-think-of-gravity/ |title=What Does A Real Astronaut Think Of 'Gravity'? |first= Garrett |last=Reisman |work=Forbes |accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], astronomer and skeptic [[Phil Plait]], and veteran NASA astronaut and spacewalker [[Scott E. Parazynski]] have offered comments about some of the most "glaring" inaccuracies.&lt;ref name="ScottParazynski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/10/neil-degrasse-tyson-gravity/|title=Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson Fact-Checks Gravity on Twitter|work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|date=October 7, 2013|accessdate=October 8, 2013|first=Angela|last=Watercutter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BadAstronomy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Plait |first=Phil |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/10/04/ba_movie_review_gravity.html |title=Bad Astronomy Movie Review: Gravity |work=Slate |date=October 4, 2013 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Dissolve]]'' characterized these complaints as "absurd", problems "only an astrophysicist would find".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedissolve.com/features/one-year-later/799-one-year-later-gravity/|title=One Year Later: Gravity|work=The Dissolve|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of differences from reality include:
* Several observers (including Plait and Tyson) said that in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need to tug the tether gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dewey|first=Caitlin|title=Here's what 'Gravity' gets right and wrong about space|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/21/heres-what-gravity-gets-right-and-wrong-about-space/|newspaper=Washington Post|date=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By the time the first module of Tiangong-1, the Chinese space station, was launched in 2011, the US Space Shuttles had been retired from service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131027-why-gravity-is-junk-science|title=Why Gravity is junk science|first=Quentin|last=Cooper|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stone is shown not wearing [[Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment|liquid-cooled ventilation garments]] or even socks, which are always worn under the EVA suit to protect against extreme temperatures in space. Neither was she shown wearing [[Maximum Absorbency Garment|space diapers]].&lt;ref name="ScottParazynski" /&gt;  
* Stone's tears first roll down her face in micro-gravity, and are later seen floating off her face. After being pushed from her eye by her eyelid, the [[surface tension]] is not sufficient for the tears to continue adhering to her jawline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/20597-how-astronauts-cry-space-video.html |title=How Astronauts Cry in Space (Video) |first=Chris |last=Hadfield |publisher=Space.com |date=April 11, 2013 |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film correctly portrays the spherical nature of drops of liquid in a micro-gravity environment.&lt;ref name="UCLA" /&gt;
* The Hubble Space Telescope, which is being repaired at the beginning of the film, previously had an altitude of about {{convert|559|km|mi}} and an [[orbital inclination]] of 28.5 degrees. As of the release of the film, the ISS had an altitude of around {{convert|420|km|mi}} and an orbital inclination of 51.65 degrees. The significant differences between orbital parameters would have made it impossible to travel between the two spacecraft without precise preparation, planning, calculation, the appropriate technology, and a large quantity of fuel at the time.&lt;ref name="UCLA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScottParazynski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BadAstronomy" /&gt;
* Kowalski's use of the MMU as his personal jet pack zipping around the spacewalking scene was criticized by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'''s Jeffery Kluger as being unrealistic. NASA's spacewalks are strictly choreographed in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://science.time.com/2013/10/01/what-gravity-gets-right-and-wrong-about-space/ | work=Time | title='Gravity' Fact Check: What the Season's Big Movie Gets Wrong | date=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the inaccuracies in ''Gravity'', Tyson, Plait and Parazynski said they enjoyed watching the film.&lt;ref name="ScottParazynski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BadAstronomy" /&gt; Aldrin said he hoped that the film would stimulate the public to find an interest in space again, after decades of diminishing investments into advancements in the field.&lt;ref name="Aldrin" /&gt;

He was born at [[Zürich]], 1725, and adopted medical profession by his learning and intelligence. He distinguished himself in lecturing on theory and practice of medicine, including instructions to female accoucheurs. He was one of the principal founders of [[Helvetic Society]] in 1726, others were - [[Isaak Iselin]], [[Salomon Gessner]], and some 20 others.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;

He translated the works of ''Tissot'' into [[German language|German]]; subsequently, published a ''Treatise on Rural Economy'', in acquaintance with a Swiss farmer, who is distinguished for his agriculture industry and skill, Caspar Hirzel conceived the notion of publishing the result of this man's[Swiss farmer] experience in his agricultural occupation, including facts and observations from other sources. This undertaking was published as a work entitled ''The Rustic Socrates'', which had been later translated into [[English language]] by [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]], and into other languages of [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hans |first= Caspar Hirzel|author2=Arthur Young |author3=B.

[[File:Burial_marker_for_the_heart_of_Thomas_Hardy.jpg|thumbnail|right|Burial site of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s heart]]

'''Heart-burial''' is a type of [[burial]] in which the [[heart]] is [[interred]] apart from the [[Cadaver|body]]. This is a very ancient practice, and the special reverence shown towards the heart is doubtless due to its early association with the soul, affections, courage and conscience of man.
 
In medieval Europe heart-burial was fairly common. Some of the more notable cases of this include:

*[[Robert the Bruce]], whose body lies in [[Dunfermline Abbey]], but heart is at [[Melrose Abbey]] in [[Roxburghshire]].  He wished his heart to rest at [[Jerusalem]] in the church of the [[Holy Sepulchre]], and on his deathbed entrusted the fulfilment of his wish to [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]]. The latter broke his journey to join the [[Spaniards]] in their war with the [[Nasrid dynasty|Moorish kings]] of [[Granada]], and was killed in battle. He had kept the heart of Bruce enclosed in a silver casket hanging round his neck. The heart was subsequently recovered and buried in the Abbey.
*[[Richard I of England|Richard I]], whose heart, preserved in a casket, was placed in the [[Cathedral]] in [[Rouen]], [[Normandy]]
*[[Henry I of England|Henry I]], whose body was buried in [[Reading Abbey]], but his heart, along with his bowels, brains, eyes &amp; tongue, is interred at the [[Cathedral]] in [[Rouen]], [[Normandy]]
*[[Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester]], died at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] 1219, heart returned to [[Garendon Abbey]] and there interred
*[[Eleanor of Castile]], Queen of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], whose body is interred in [[Westminster Abbey]], but whose heart is buried at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] and her other viscera in [[Lincoln Cathedral]]
*[[John II Casimir Vasa]], King of Poland, heart buried at [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] (of which he was latterly abbot), body interred at the [[Wawel]] in Kraków
* [[Ebrach Abbey]], Germany, heart burials of the [[Bishopric of Würzburg|Bishops of Würzburg]]: beginning in the 13th century, the bishops of Würzburg had their hearts brought to the monastery in Ebrach (with their entrails going to the [[Marienkirche, Würzburg|Marienkirche]], and their bodies to [[Würzburg Cathedral]]). About 30 hearts of bishops, some of which had been desecrated during the [[German Peasants' War]], are said to have found their final resting place at Ebrach. The prince-bishop [[Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn]] (d. 1617) broke with this tradition and had his heart buried in the [[:de:Neubaukirche (Würzburg)|Neubaukirche]].

A more modern example is that of [[Thomas Hardy]] whose ashes were interred in [[Poets' Corner]] of [[Westminster Abbey]] whilst his heart was buried in his beloved [[Wessex]] alongside his first wife. A recent biography of Hardy details the arguments over the decision, and addresses the long-standing rumour that the heart was stolen by a pet cat so that a pig's heart had to be used as a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2101-2378266.html{{deadlink|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another is [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute]], scholar, art patron and Catholic convert, whose heart was buried in 1900 on the [[Mount of Olives]] in Jerusalem.

Another famous heart-burial figure is music composer [[Frédéric Chopin]]. Before the funeral, pursuant to his dying wish, his heart was removed. It was preserved in alcohol (perhaps brandy) to be returned to his homeland, as he had requested. His sister smuggled it in an urn to Warsaw, where it was later sealed within a pillar of the Holy Cross Church on Krakowskie Przedmieście, beneath an epitaph sculpted by Leonard Marconi, bearing an inscription from Matthew VI:21: "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." Chopin's heart has reposed there – except for a period during World War II, when it was removed for safekeeping – within the church that was rebuilt after its virtual destruction during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. The church stands only a short distance from Chopin's last Polish residence, the Krasiński Palace at Krakowskie Przedmieście.

The most recent notable case of heart burial was of [[Otto von Habsburg]], former head of the [[House of Habsburg]], whose heart was buried at the [[Pannonhalma Archabbey]] in [[Hungary]] in 2011.

In the 1994 movie ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'', the character Samuel ([[Henry Thomas]]) is killed while serving in the Canadian army in [[World War I]].  His brother ([[Brad Pitt]]) cuts the heart out of the body and sends it home to be buried on his father's ranch in [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/legends-of-the-fall-script.html |title=Legends of the fall Script |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2583">'''Henry Cairns Westenra, 4th Baron Rossmore''' (14 November 1851 – 28 March 1874), was an [[Anglo-Irish]] soldier and [[peerage of the United Kingdom|peer]] who was briefly a member of the [[House of Lords]] before his death at the age of 22 in a riding accident.

==Life==
The son of [[Henry Westenra, 3rd Baron Rossmore|The 3rd Baron Rossmore]] (1792–1860) by his second marriage to Josephine Julia Helen Lloyd, the daughter of Henry Lloyd of [[County Tipperary]] and of Harriet Amelia Carden, Rossmore was born in 1851. He had two sisters and three brothers: Frances Kathleen (died 1925), Norah Josephine Harcourt (died 1934), [[Derrick Westenra, 5th Baron Rossmore]] (1853–1921), Richard Hamilton (1854–1880), and Peter Craven (1855–1932).&lt;ref name=burke&gt;Charles Mosley, ed., ''Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knightage'', 107th edition in 3 volumes, vol. 3 (Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003), p. 3408&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 1860, when he was only nine, his father died and he succeeded to the titles of [[Baron Rossmore]] in the [[peerage of Ireland]] and Baron Rossmore in the [[peerage of the United Kingdom]], the second giving him a seat in the [[House of Lords]] as soon as he reached the age of twenty-one.&lt;ref name=burke/&gt; He also inherited large estates in [[County Monaghan]], and from his father's first wife, Anne Douglas-Hamilton (c. 1796–1844), a natural daughter of [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 8th Duke of Hamilton|The Duke of Hamilton and Brandon]] (1756–1799), a further estate in the [[Aran Islands]].

Lord Rossmore joined the [[1st Regiment of Life Guards|1st Life Guards]], a [[cavalry]] [[regiment]] of the [[British Army]]. He died in a riding accident on 28 March 1874 and was buried in the family vault at [[Rossmore Castle|Rossmore Park]]. His younger brother Derrick thus succeeded unexpectedly to the titles and estates. The house was abandoned in the 1940s, fell into a ruin, and was demolished in 1975. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Early life==
Sternberg was born in [[New York City|New York]] to parents of [[Austria]]n and [[Russia]]n descent. He studied at the [[Juilliard School]], the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and [[New York University]], obtaining a B.A. in [[musicology]] in 1939. He also attended the Graduate School of Arts and Science at NYU and [[Harvard]] from 1939 to 1940. After the war he spent time studying under [[Léon Barzin]] and [[Pierre Monteux]].&lt;ref name="CG" /&gt;

==Career==
Sternberg's conducting debut took place on December 7, 1941 at the helm of the [[National Youth Administration Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="Oron"/&gt; Shortly thereafter he entered military service in the [[US Army]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An American in Vienna|url=http://www.temple.edu/boyer/documents/TheRecordCollectorArticleonJSWinter2012.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2017|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and at the end of the war he became conductor of the [[Shanghai Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="Cornebise"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornebise|first=Alfred Emile|title=The Shanghai Stars and Stripes: Witness to the Transition to Peace, 1945-1946|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fgcHHRxyD4C|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786447565|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the US he traveled to Austria, where in 1947 he made his debut conducting the [[Vienna Symphony|Vienna Symphony Orchestra]]. He was the conductor on the first recording by the pianist Alfred Brendel of Prokofiev's ''Fifth Concerto''. Around this time Sternberg collaborated with [[H.C. Robbins Landon]], assisting in the search for music manuscripts all over Europe. Robbins Landon later founded the [[Haydn Society]], prompting Sternberg to produce a series of recordings of Haydn and Mozart pieces, including the [[Nelson Mass]] and [[Posthorn Serenade]].&lt;ref name="Oron"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,856339,00.html|title=Music: New Records, Nov. 21, 1949|date=Nov 21, 1949|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year of conducting the [[Symphony Nova Scotia|Halifax Symphony Orchestra]], Sternberg directed the [[Royal Flemish Opera]] for five years, subsequently returning to the US to become music director and conductor of the [[Harkness Ballet]]. He also served as musical director of the [[Atlanta Opera|Atlanta Opera and Ballet]], and accepted a visiting professorship of conducting at the [[Eastman School of Music]], a position that he also later held at [[Temple University]], where he remained for 20 years.&lt;ref name="CG" /&gt; He also served as a judge of conducting for [[The American Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanprize.org/judges.html|title=Judges|publisher=The American Prize|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg remained active throughout his life as a lecturer, conductor, and mentor. His wife, the English-German painter [[Ursula Sternberg-Hertz]], died in 2000. A biography of Sternberg was later published by [[Tricorn Press]] (2014). In May 2018 Sternberg died of heart failure at the age of 98 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/05/prweb15479341.htm Jonathan Sternberg, American Conductor, Musical Director and Professor, Dies at 98]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schildkraut was born in [[Vienna]], Austria, the son of Erna (née Weinstein) and stage (and later motion picture) actor [[Rudolph Schildkraut]].&lt;ref name=whos&gt;{{cite book| title=Who's Who in the Theatre| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3w3AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Rudolph+Schildkraut+Erna| volume=3| last=Parker| first=John| publisher=Pittman| year=1916| accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was [[Austrian Jews|Jewish]].&lt;ref name=jta&gt;{{cite news| title=Joseph Schildkraut, Noted American Jewish Actor, Dead; Was 68| url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1964/01/23/3075866/joseph-schildkraut-noted-american-jewish-actor-dead-was-68| date=23 January 1964| newspaper=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]| accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Schildkraut moved to the United States in the early 1900s. He appeared in many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions. Among the plays that he starred in was a notable production of ''[[Peer Gynt]]''.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/joseph-schildkraut/|title=Joseph Schildkraut - Hollywood Star Walk |work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Schildkraut played the title role in the first American stage production of [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s ''[[Liliom]]'', the play that would eventually become the basis for [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/liliom-9062|title=Liliom – Broadway Play – Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/70355/Carousel/screenplay-info.html|title=Carousel (1956) - Screenplay Info - TCM.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then began working in [[silent movies]], although he did return to the stage occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/joseph-schildkraut-p63650|title=Joseph Schildkraut - Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos - AllMovie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had early success in film as the Chevalier de Vaudrey in [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Orphans of the Storm]]'' with [[Lillian Gish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/04/98966257.pdf|title=New-York Times, 4 January 1922|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he was featured in [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s epic 1927 film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'', as [[Judas Iscariot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-king-of-kings-v27430|title=The King of Kings (1927) - Cecil B.

Schildkraut received an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role as [[Alfred Dreyfus]] in ''[[The Life of Emile Zola]]'' (1937).&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He gained further fame for playing the ambitious duc d'Orléans in the historical epic ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' (1938), opposite [[Norma Shearer]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[John Barrymore]] and [[Robert Morley]], and gave a notable performance as the villainous [[Nicolas Fouquet]] in ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' (1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/marie-antoinette-v31437|title=Marie Antoinette (1938) - W.S.

Schildkraut is perhaps best remembered today for playing the role of Otto Frank in both the [[The Diary of Anne Frank (play)|original stage production]] and film version of ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959).&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He was also an active [[character actor]] and appeared in guest roles on several early television shows, including the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'', in which he played Claudius in the 1953 television production of ''[[Hamlet]]'', with [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b72301155|title=Hamlet (1953)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schildkraut also hosted and starred in ''[[Joseph Schildkraut Presents]]'', a short-lived series on the [[DuMont Television Network]] from October 1953 to January 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/joseph-schildkraut-presents/202429/|title=Joseph Schildkraut Presents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, during the 3rd season of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', he made his first appearance on episode 9, "[[Deaths-Head Revisited]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-twilight-zone/episode-9-season-3/deaths-head-revisited/100555/|title=The Twilight Zone|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later played an elderly man in "[[The Trade-Ins]]" in season 3, episode 31 of the same show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b77ea896c|title=The Trade-ins (1962)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, he was nominated for a Best Actor [[Emmy Award]] for his performance in a guest starring role on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Sam Benedict]]'' [[legal drama]] which starred [[Edmond O'Brien]] and [[Richard Rust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1963|title=Nominees/Winners|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Schildkraut was married three times. His first marriage was to actress Elise Bartlett in 1923; they divorced in 1931. He married Mary McKay in 1932, until her death on February 17, 1962. In 1963, Schildkraut married Leonora Rogers, who survived him.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; Schildkraut died at his home in [[New York City]] of a [[heart attack]]. His father also died at the same age, also of a heart attack.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news|title=Joseph Schildkraut, Actor, Dies|work=The New York Times|date=January 22, 1964|accessdate=January 13, 2017|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/22/joseph-schildkraut-actor-dies.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his contributions to the motion picture industry, Schildkraut has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6780 Hollywood Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/joseph-schildkraut |title=Walk of Fame Stars-Joseph Schildkraut |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=October 13, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403085302/http://walkoffame.com/joseph-schildkraut |archivedate=April 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is interred in the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Thomas E.|title=Where They're Buried: A Directory Containing More Than Twenty Thousand Names of Notable Persons Buried in American Cemeteries, With Listings of Many Prominent People Who Were Cremated|location=Baltimore, Md.|publisher=Clearfield Co.|date=1998|isbn=9780806348230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eLWao2lIGTEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|page=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series deals with the experiences on Earth of a man named Prot (rhymes with "wrote").&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; It is written in the [[first person narrative|first person]] from the point of view of Prot's psychiatrist.

''K-PAX'' was adapted into a [[K-PAX (film)|theatrical film of the same name]], released in 2001.

==Synopsis==
In 1990, a white male is picked up by the [[New York City Police Department|New York Police]] after being found bending over the victim of a mugging at [[Grand Central Terminal]] in midtown [[Manhattan]]. After responding to the police questions with somewhat strange answers, he is transferred to [[Bellevue Hospital]] for evaluation. Although not physically ill, he is found to harbour the strange delusion that he is from a planet called K-PAX in the [[constellation]] of [[Lyra]]. The patient, who calls himself "prot" (intentionally lower-case to reflect the insignificance of an individual life form in the universe), is eventually transferred to the [[Manhattan]] [[Psychiatric]] Institute (MPI), where he becomes the patient of Dr. [[Gene Brewer]].

Prot (capitalized here to begin a sentence) is extremely fond of fruit, including banana skins and apple cores, which he eats during each session. He tells Brewer that he is 337 (Earth) years old, that he has visited Earth often, and that on this visit he has traveled to most of the world's countries for the past 4 years and 9 months. He exhibits a sense of humor: during their first session, he says to Brewer, "But don't worry - I'm not going to leap out of your chest,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brewer| first = Gene| title = K-PAX| date = 1995| publisher = A Wyatt Book for St. Martin's Press| location = New York| isbn = 0-312-11840-6| page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an allusion to the film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''. Brewer discovers that prot is also a [[Savant syndrome|savant]] who possesses arcane information about astronomy that excites a group of astronomers who meet him. Prot states that he possesses at least rudimentary conversational knowledge of most human languages as well as the languages of animals, including [[Whale vocalization|whale song]], and the apparent gibberish of some of the patients with [[schizophrenia]].

Though prot's dialogue is usually satirical, he turns out to be highly [[Suggestion|suggestible]] and easily [[Hypnosis|hypnotized]]. Once Brewer learns this, he begins more serious therapy.

Brewer, with the help of a journalist named Giselle Griffin, discovers that prot may be an alter ego (the result of [[Dissociative identity disorder]]) of Robert Porter, whose life was devastated by the murder of his wife and child and his subsequent killing of the perpetrator. Brewer speculates that the name prot is derived from Porter's surname.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, ''K-PAX'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

When prot "returns" to his own planet, Robert Porter is left in a [[catatonic]] state. However, Bess, another patient prot had promised to take with him, disappears along with a box of souvenirs prot has been collecting.

Prot promises to return in "about five of your years."

==K-PAXian==
{{plot|date=May 2018}}
K-PAXian is the term used in the books to refer to the inhabitants of the planet K-PAX. Their language is pax-o. In the book, all knowledge of K-PAX and its attendant species comes from the individual known as prot.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, ''K-PAX'', p. 6: "I discovered in due course that prot tended to capitalize the names of planets, stars, etc., but not those of persons, institutions, even countries. For the sake of consistency, and to better depict the character of my patient, I have adopted that convention throughout this report."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the books, prot notes that [[Jane Goodall]], [[John Lennon]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] and [[Albert Schweitzer]] are among the most K-PAXian (famous) humans on Earth.

K-PAXians' forefathers were something like worms and lived in the ground, whereas humans' forefathers were fish and other aquatic beings.

===Physiology===
The conditions on the planet K-PAX are used in the books to explain a number of Prot's oddities.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

K-PAX is seated far from the two stars it orbits: K-MON and K-RIL. Thus, K-PAXians experience an eternal dusk as K-PAX orbits in a helix around the two celestial bodies. These stars are also not like the Sun because they are not main sequence stars. From the descriptions in the novel it is assumed that they are [[protostar]]s nearing their inevitable collapse. The constant phase shift of light on K-PAX and the lack of light made it necessary to evolve the ability to detect shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, i.e., ultraviolet. This explains prot's need to wear his sunglasses in all but very dim conditions. In the book, when Prot is questioned as to why a K-PAXian appears human on Earth, he responds, "Why is a soap bubble round?" He explains that  K-PAXians appear human because the humanoid form is the most efficient shape to explore the planet. The method of reproduction of the dremers (prot's species, a term used in the book), unlike human [[sexual intercourse]], is considered extremely unpleasant, due to intense feelings of pain and horrible smells, among other unpleasant sensations. Prot is completely uninterested in [[flirtation]]. Prot can age to a thousand years, like his parents, who are in their late six-hundreds. Prot's age contributes to his knowledge base, and on Earth, prot is considered a savant, although it is never specified whether dremer intelligence is inherent or a result of K-PAXian society. Prot makes it clear that dremers make every attempt to improve and disseminate their understanding of truth. Prot ultimately communicates that sentient beings on K-PAX have such a universal awareness of life that it would seem a majority of human endeavor is benign, but he is excited for us because our race has a bright future if only we disregard our primitive misconceptions of our surroundings.

===Society===
In K-PAXian society, sex is considered unpleasant (although not by all species), [[veganism]] is preferred, [[speciesism]] has been overcome. Eating [[meat]] is never considered and there are no formal [[law]]s (e.g. police officers), [[government]]s (in other words - [[anarchy]]), schools, or [[religion]]. The anarchy on K-PAX is a non-destructive, non-violent, and peaceful one; it's a self-harmonizing, ordered anarchy. The beings reason with those beings who engage in destructive or immoral behaviour, although such instances are extremely rare. All living beings, from worm-beings to the more humanoid dremers (prot's kind), are regarded as civilized parts of the planet's community. Some readers view this as a more advanced society, or [[utopia]], with individuals living in peace and harmony with each other, without the need for law. K-PAXians have [[no fixed abode]] and instead live a sort of nomadic life, drifting between certain settlements/villages where food, clothing, and other things are stored. K-PAXians do not have a set occupation; day-to-day tasks such as cleaning, infrastructure maintenance, and harvesting food are handled by all K-PAXians when they need to be done. Children may or may not know their parents, but this is unimportant as they are raised by their society as a whole. K-PAXians do not develop strong interpersonal bonds, but view all beings with great compassion. Despite a lack of major cities, K-PAX does feature a number of large library type structures for the dissemination of knowledge. K-PAXians are far more technologically advanced than humans. K-PAXian society seems very similar to that described by Sir [[Thomas More]] in his novel ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]].''

It seems that truth, with its absolute nature, is very desirable for prot. Readers can infer that knowledge of truth is something like a divine state of being for the K-PAXian society, considering prot's vast knowledge, scientific aptitude, and admiration for the arts. In this light, truth becomes as important to prot as it was for [[Mohandas Gandhi]]. Besides truth's revered status in K-PAXian society, the notion of "God" (anthropomorphic) or "gods" is seen as illusive and false conformity. It can thus be assumed that K-PAXian society is [[agnostic]]. K-PAXian society does not have a need for jokes or games, because life on K-PAX is considered to be fun and interesting anyway. Prot also mentions that our planet just arrived at a minor stage of planetary evolution - he thinks we are as yet children. The K-PAXians arrived at "K" on an alphabetic development-scale (A-K), meaning perfect stability and peace, whereas Earth is a class "B" planet. Class "A" planets used to be "B" planets but were destroyed by their own inhabitants.

Prot even says that humans do not have a good sense of humor; games and jokes are seen as obsolete on K-PAX and even as mindless by prot (to some degree). K-PAXians enjoy time with meditative walks in the woods, community needs, the arts (sculpturing, painting, music, etc.), scientific observations, conversation about ideas and information, and journeys to other planets.

The whole civilization of K-PAX despises and does not use any kind of violent or revengeful punishment or ostracism, as prot states, the mystery of life contains non-violence. K-PAXians do not [[domesticate]] each other (for example, dremers do not domesticate the ruli species, nor amps the worm beings).

===Technology===
Despite living a fairly [[agrarianism|agrarian]] lifestyle, K-PAXians are highly technologically advanced. Most notable is their ability to travel [[Faster-than-light|faster than the speed of light]] both around and between planets. K-PAXians have developed computers with complete holography. These computers engage all senses and reproduce events of the history of K-PAX or other inhabited planets. K-PAXian villages contain laboratories in which the components of herbs and other plants are analyzed for medicine, resulting in cures of every existing ailment. K-PAXians do not need to synthesize these components into new products, as they have mastered chemistry to gain any needed substance directly from the plants. They do not have the need to create genetically new forms either. K-PAXians use two types of solar energy, having moved beyond their previous use of bacterial decay, gravitational energy and muscle force as energy. Prot describes Nuclear Fusion and Solar Energy as the only viable types of energy, as together they balance out each other's side effects. Prot warns Gene Brewer about the use of [[nuclear fission]], informing him that it creates too much dangerous waste product.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
The 2001 film ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-PAX]]'' was directed by [[Iain Softley]] and is based on the first book in this series. [[Kevin Spacey]] portrays Prot, and [[Jeff Bridges]] plays the psychiatrist.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

===Play===
''K-PAX'' was made into a stage play, also written by Gene Brewer, and has been performed at the Lion and Unicorn Theatre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actprovocateur.net/newwritings.html|title=Act Provocateur New Writings|accessdate=2008-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827174908/http://www.actprovocateur.net/newwritings.html|archivedate=2008-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Victor Sobchak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actprovocateur.net/kpaxreviews.html |author=Waites, Aline |title=Ham &amp; High reviews |work=Hampstead and Highgate Express |accessdate=2008-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008025631/http://www.actprovocateur.net/kpaxreviews.html |archivedate=2008-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the play made its North American debut at The Geneva Underground Playhouse in Geneva, Illinois directed by Eric Peter Schwartz.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Reception==
''[[Booklist]]'' called the novel "fascinating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Beatty, William |title= K-PAX |journal= [[Booklist]] |date= March 1, 1995 |page= 1177 |volume= 91 |number= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist Allan Beveridge wrote that the novel is a good example of "why psychiatrists should read fiction", saying that it shows "how to approach moral quandaries and decision-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/182/5/385.full |author= Beveridge, Allan |title= Should psychiatrists read fiction? |journal= [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |date= 2003 |volume= 182 |pages= 385–387 |doi=10.1192/bjp.182.5.385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction scholar David Ketterer compares it with the novel ''[[Star-Begotten]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/review_essays/ketterer108.htm |author= Ketterer, David |title= The "Martianized" H.G. Wells? |journal= [[Science Fiction Studies]] |date= July 2009 |volume= 36, Part 2 |number= 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Michael Berry wrote, "There aren't many possible denouements for a book like this, and Brewer steers a middle course between the extremes of outright fantasy and predictable mundaneness. ''K-PAX'' displays the mildly off-putting attitude found in such movies as ''[[Rain Man]]'' and ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', that we all can learn so much about ourselves from the simple-minded, but one can't deny that some of the story's episodes are genuinely funny and touching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Thrillers-Killers-and-the-Cosmos-3041626.php#page-2 |author= Berry, Michael |title= Thrillers, Killers and the Cosmos |newspaper= San Francisco Chronicle |date= March 12, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Lisa Koosis wrote that Prot "is one of the more extraordinary characters found in current science fiction" and that the author, "without actually having the characters set foot on another planet, manages to bring an alien world to life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.rusbiz.com/article_index.html?cat=214&amp;id=36433 |author= Koosis, Lisa |title= One Remarkable Journey: A Review of "K-PAX" |publisher= www.rusbiz.com |date= July 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erick Lee Purkhiser''' (October 21, 1946 – February 4, 2009), better known by the stage name '''Lux Interior''', was an American singer and a founding member of the American [[punk rock]] band [[The Cramps]] from 1972&lt;ref name="sacto"/&gt; until his death in 2009 at age 62.

==Early life==
Born in [[Akron, Ohio]], he grew up in its nearby suburb of [[Stow, Ohio|Stow]] and graduated from [[Stow-Munroe Falls High School|Stow High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Appreciation: Akron-born garage rocker Lux Interior was the king of trash-culture |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/entertainment/2009/02/appreciation_akronborn_garage.html |first=John |last=Petkovic |date=February 5, 2009 |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |accessdate=October 16, 2009 |quote=But the Stow High School grad came up with the idea for the band while watching late-night TV in Northeast Ohio. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913000230/http://blog.cleveland.com/entertainment/2009/02/appreciation_akronborn_garage.html |archivedate=September 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He met his wife [[Poison Ivy (musician)|Kristy Wallace]], better known as Poison Ivy, a.k.a. Ivy Rorschach, in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] in 1972, when he and a friend picked her up when she was hitchhiking.&lt;ref name="sacto"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/ticket/archives/019288.html |title=Cramps singer Lux Interior dies at 60 |date=February 4, 2009 |first=Rachel |last=Leibrock |newspaper=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208152157/http://sacbee.com/static/weblogs/ticket/archives/019288.html |archivedate=February 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astral"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/lux-interiors-astral-ascension-jonny-whitesides-report-from-the-ceremony-2411543 |title=Lux Interior's Astral Ascension |first=Jonny |last=Whiteside |newspaper=[[LA Weekly]] |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple founded the band after they moved from California to Ohio in 1973, and then to New York in 1975, where they soon became part of the flourishing punk scene.&lt;ref name="sacto" /&gt;

==Style==
Lux Interior's name came "from an old car commercial", having previously flirted with the names Vip Vop and Raven Beauty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Johnston |title=The Wild Wild World of The Cramps |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his wife's name change was inspired by "a vision she received in a dream".&lt;ref name="sacto" /&gt; The couple called their musical style [[psychobilly]], originally claiming it to have been inspired by a [[Johnny Cash]] song, "[[One Piece at a Time]]", and later saying that they were just using the phrase as "carny terms to drum up business."

Interior was known for a frenetic and provocative stage show that included high heels, near-nudity and sexually suggestive movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Male |first=Andrew |title=Lux Interior: October 21, 1946 - February 4, 2009 |url=http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2009/02/lux_interior_october_21_1946_f.html |magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521155253/http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2009/02/lux_interior_october_21_1946_f.html |archivedate=May 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His speciality was the microphone [[Fellatio|blow job]], where he could get the entire head of an [[Shure SM58|SM-58]] microphone into his mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gorgonetta.tumblr.com/post/26906076774/b-w-photo-of-lux-interior-on-stage-fellating-a |title=Gorgonetta: B/w photo of Lux Interior on stage, fellating a microphone |website=Gorgonetta.tumblr.com |date=July 10, 2012 |accessdate=April 2, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703184227/http://gorgonetta.tumblr.com/post/26906076774/b-w-photo-of-lux-interior-on-stage-fellating-a |archivedate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gearslutz.com/board/attachments/so-much-gear-so-little-time/5710d1109389678-sexy-microphone-pictures-microfono.jpg |title=Sexy Microphone Pictures |website=Gearslutz.com |year=2005 |accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cramps gave their last show in November 2006.&lt;ref name="latimes-obit"&gt;{{cite news |first=August |last=Brown |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Lux Interior dies at 60; founder, front man of punk band the Cramps |date=February 4, 2009 |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-lux-interior5-2009feb05-story.html |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked why he continued to play live well into middle age, he told the ''[[LA Times]]'' 
{{cquote|It's a little bit like asking a junkie how he's been able to keep on dope all these years--it's just so much fun. You pull into one town and people scream, 'I love you, I love you, I love you.' And you go to a bar and have a great rock 'n' roll show and go to the next town and people scream, 'I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.' It's hard to walk away from all that.&lt;ref name="latimes-obit" /&gt;}}

In 2002 Lux Interior performed the voice of a character on ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' – the lead singer of an all-bird rock band called the Bird Brains.&lt;ref name="nytimes-obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lux Interior, 62, Singer in the Punk-Rock Era, Is Dead |first=Ben |last=Sisario |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 5, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/arts/music/06interior.html |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Kenny]], who voices SpongeBob, attended his memorial ceremony in 2009.&lt;ref name="astral" /&gt;

Interior was also a painter (mainly in his college years) and [[visual artist]]. In particular he was a [[Stereo camera|3D camera]] collector and enthusiast with which he created artworks and collages.&lt;ref name="guardian-obit"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/13/lux-interior-cramps-obituaries-2009 |title=Obituaries 2009: Lux Interior |first=James |last=Sclavunos |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=December 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Lux Interior died at 4:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on February 4, 2009, at Glendale Memorial Hospital in [[California]].  The cause of death was [[aortic dissection]].  He was survived by his wife Ivy and two brothers, Michael Purkhiser&lt;ref name="cleveland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index_story.ssf?/music/more/local/timeline/1980/1980postpunk.html |title=1980s: A New Scene Takes Hold - Post-Punk |website=Cleveland.com |year=2015 |accessdate=April 2, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702065213/http://www.cleveland.com/music/index_story.ssf?%2Fmusic%2Fmore%2Flocal%2Ftimeline%2F1980%2F1980postpunk.html |archivedate=July 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ronald "Skip" Purkhiser. The memorial service for Lux was held on February 21 at the Windmill Chapel of the [[Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine]]. Lux's brother Michael also provided insight into his relationship with Lux in a newspaper article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ohio.com/entertainment/malcolm-x-abram-sibling-recalls-lux-interior-punk-icon-1.103323 |title=Sibling recalls Lux Interior, punk icon |first=Malcolm X |last=Abram |website=Ohio.com |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/lux-interior-in-memoriam/ |title=Lux Interior : In Memoriam |magazine=Trebuchet |year=2013 |accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major general|Maj. Gen.]] [[Highness|HH]] [[Maharaja]] [[Sawai (title)|Sawai]] [[Shri]] [[Sir]] '''Man Singh II''' [[GCSI]] [[GCIE]] (b. [[Sawai (title)|Sawai]] Mor Mukut Singh; 21 August 1912 – 24 June 1970) was the last ruling [[Maharaja]] of [[Jaipur State]] belonging to [[Kachwaha]] clan of [[Rajputs]]. He ruled the [[princely state]] between 1922 and 1949, when the state acceded unto the [[Dominion of India]]. Thereafter, he held office as [[Rajpramukh]] of [[Rajasthan]] between 1949 and 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rajassembly.nic.in/govphoto.htm |title=Former Governors of Rajasthan |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= Rajasthan Legislative Assembly |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later life, he served as Ambassador of India to Spain. He was also a notable sportsman and celebrated [[polo]] player.

==Early life==
[[File:Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh.jpg|right|thumb|Maharaja Sawai [[Madho Singh II]]]]
Sawai Man Singh II, was born Mor Mukut Singh, the second son of [[Thakur (Indian title)|Thakur]] Sawai Singh of Isarda by his wife Sugan Kunwar, a lady from Kotla village in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. His father was a nobleman belonging to the Kachwaha clan of Rajputs. Mor Mukut grew up in the dusty, walled township of Isarda, a chief [[Thikana]] of the Rajawat sub-clan which lies between the towns of [[Sawai Madhopur]] and Jaipur in present-day Rajasthan. His family was connected to the ruling house of Jaipur and [[Kotah]] (where his father's sister was married). The then-Maharaja of Jaipur, Sawai [[Madho Singh II]], had been born the son of a former Thakur of Isarda and had been adopted into the ruling family of Jaipur. After giving him up for adoption, Madho Singh's actual father had in turn lacked for an heir. He adopted the son of a distant kinsman and was succeeded by that lad as Thakur of Isarda. That lad was Sawai Singh, father of Mor Mukut Singh. In this manner, Mor Mukut could be reckoned near kin to Maharaja Madho Singh II of Jaipur.

After being adopted to become Maharaja of Jaipur, Madho Singh II had numerous (no less than 65) children by various concubines, but the highly superstitious Maharaja was warned by a sage against having legitimate heirs and thus took great care not to impregnate his five wives. On 24 March 1921, Madho Singh II adopted Mor Mukut to be his son and heir. The boy was given the name "Man Singh" upon his adoption. Madho Singh II died on 7 September 1922 and was succeeded by Man Singh as Maharaja of Jaipur and head of the Kachwaha clan of Rajputs. The new Maharaja was ten years old.

==Maharaja of Jaipur==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sawai Man Singh II, Inspecting the Jaipur State forces.jpg|right|thumb|The Maharaja inspecting Jaipur State forces during [[World War II]]]] --&gt;
Upon obtaining his ruling powers, Man Singh embarked on a programme of modernisation, creating infrastructure and founding numerous public institutions that would later result in Jaipur being selected the capital of Rajasthan. At the time of India's Independence in 1947, the maharaja acceded Jaipur to the Dominion of India and in March 1949 he merged the princely state with the new state of Rajasthan, surrendering his sovereignty and accepting the appointment of Rajpramukh of that state until the office was abolished when the Indian states were further re-organised in 1956. Although the Indian princes had relinquished their ruling powers, they remained entitled to their titles, privy purses and other privileges until the adoption of the 26th amendment to the [[Constitution of India]] on 28 December 1971. Accordingly, [[Sir]] Man Singh II remained Maharaja of Jaipur until his death.

In 1958, Sir Man Singh was one of several rulers who realised the potential of [[tourism]] in Rajasthan, turning [[Rambagh Palace]] into a luxury hotel. Under his rule various laws of land reform were first introduced in his state, such as the Jaipur Tenancy Act.  Later in 1956, the ''Jagidari'' ([[feudal]]) form of political administration were abolished during the government of the Congress Party in India. In 1962 he was elected to Council of States, the Rajya Sabha the Upper House of Indian Parliament with term till 1968,&lt;ref name="rajya-sabha"&gt;{{cite web|title=SINGH, SHRI SAWAI MAN - RAJYA SABHA MEMBERS BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES 1952 - 2003|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/pre_member/1952_2003/s.pdf|publisher=Rajya Sabha Secretariat|accessdate=21 November 2017|page=34|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; however in 1965, the Indian government appointed Sawai Man Singh, Indian Ambassador to Spain. Utilising his various contacts in Europe, he spent much of his time in Europe to ensue new military technology and arms-deal for the Indian army (Crewe).

He was especially noted as an enthusiastic (10-Goal) [[polo]] player, winning among other trophies the World Cup in 1933. During the 1950s, Man Singh owned [[Saint Hill Manor]] in [[East Grinstead]], [[West Sussex]], which was sold to [[L. Ron Hubbard]], founder of [[Scientology]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sainthillmanor.org.uk/manor.html|title=Visit Historic Saint Hill Manor |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Saint Hill Manor |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
Man Singh II was married three times, and his three wives lived in the same household together, as per Indian custom. His first two marriages were to suitable brides chosen from the royal family of [[Jodhpur]], whose Rajput heritage and social ranking were similar to his own. The senior Maharani, known within the palace as 'First her Highness,' was Marudhar Kunwar, sister of Sumer Singh, Maharaja of Jodhpur. She was about twelve years older than him and bore him two children, first a daughter, Prem Kumari and then his eldest son and heir, [[Bhawani Singh of Jaipur|Bhawani Singh]]. His second wife was Maharani Kishore Kanwar, niece of his first wife and daughter of Maharaja Sumer Singh of Jodhpur. She was five years younger than him and bore him two sons.

She may become the first [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] saint in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Information Service of Ukraine Portal News, in Ukrainian''&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria, being of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] descent, was born in 1959, in [[Joaquim Távora]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], Brazil.

When a school caught fire in 1986, Maria refused a chance to leave the building, instead she stayed inside and assisted her pupils in escaping. Berushko assisted in saving the lives of 5 children, but 8 children died together with the teacher in the fire.

The Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Latin America already placed the issue of Maria's beatification to the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;''Orthodoxy in Ukraine Portal, 15.10.2007, Ukrainian language''&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected the final decision to be made within three years.

A street in the Brazilian town of [[Curitiba]] has already been named after Maria Berushko (rua Maria Aparecida Beruski).

His first and best known book, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927), though unfinished, is one of the central philosophical works of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lackey | first1 = Douglas | year = 1999 | title = What Are the Modern Classics? The Baruch Poll of Great Philosophy in the Twentieth Century | url = | journal = Philosophical Forum | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 329–46 | doi=10.1111/0031-806x.00022}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first part, Heidegger attempted to turn away from "[[ontic]]" questions about beings to [[ontological]] questions about [[Being]], and recover the most fundamental philosophical question: the question of Being, of what it means for something to be. Heidegger approached the question through an inquiry into the being that has an understanding of Being, and asks the question about it, namely, Human being, which he called ''[[Dasein]]'' ("being-there"). Heidegger argued that ''Dasein'' is defined by Care, its practically engaged and concernful mode of [[Heideggerian terminology#Being-in-the-world|being-in-the-world]], in opposition to such [[Rationalist]] thinkers as [[René Descartes]] who located the essence of man in his thinking abilities.

For Heidegger thinking is thinking ''about'' things originally discovered in our everyday practical engagements. The consequence of this is that our capacity to think cannot be the most central quality of our being because thinking is a reflecting upon this more original way of discovering the world. In the second part of his book, Heidegger argues that human being is even more fundamentally structured by its [[Temporality]], or its concern with, and relationship to [[time]], existing as a structurally open "possibility-for-being". He emphasized the importance of [[Authenticity (philosophy)|Authenticity]] in human existence, involving a truthful relationship to our [[thrownness]] into a world which we are "always already" concerned with, and to our [[Heideggerian terminology#Being-toward-death|being-towards-death]], the Finitude of the time and being we are given, and the closing down of our various possibilities for being through time.&lt;ref name="JR"&gt;John Richardson, ''Heidegger'', Routledge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger also made critical contributions to philosophical conceptions of [[truth]], arguing that its original meaning was [[Aletheia|unconcealment]], to philosophical analyses of [[art]] as a site of the revelation of truth, and to philosophical understanding of [[language]] as the "house of being."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger. "Brief über den »Humanismus«" ("Letter on 'Humanism'"). Frankfurt a.M.: Klostermann, 1949. p. 5: "Die Sprache ist das Haus des Seins."&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's later work includes criticisms of [[technology]]'s instrumentalist understanding in the [[Western mystery tradition|Western tradition]] as "[[enframing]]", treating all of [[Nature]] as a "standing reserve" on call for human purposes.&lt;ref name="JR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, Martin. ''Poetry, Language, Thought''. (New York: Harper Modern Perennial Classics, 2001.), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger is a controversial figure, largely for [[Martin Heidegger and Nazism|his affiliation with Nazism]], as [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[University of Freiburg]] for 11 months, before his resignation in April 1934, for which he neither apologized nor publicly expressed regret.&lt;ref name=CI&gt;The 1966 interview published in 1976 after Heidegger's death as {{cite web |title=Only a God Can Save Us |url=https://archive.org/stream/MartinHeidegger-DerSpiegelInterviewenglishTranslationonlyAGodCan/Heidegger-derSpiegelInterview1966 |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=1976-05-31 |pages=193–219 |translator=William J.

Heidegger was born in rural [[Meßkirch]],  [[Baden-Württemberg]], the son of Johanna (Kempf) and Friedrich Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIrWZajVZuwC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Johanna+Kempf+Heidegger&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FAi2Rz21CY&amp;sig=x1hdIANAzkk5WYHbOAnA23szHhc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2pqTyr-POAhVLGx4KHd2YDikQ6AEIHDAE|title=Heidegger: The Man and the Thinker|first=Thomas|last=Sheehan|date=31 December 2011|publisher=Transaction Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised a [[Roman Catholic]], he was the son of the [[Sexton (office)|sexton]] of the village church that adhered to the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1870, which was observed mainly by the poorer class of Meßkirch. His family could not afford to send him to university, so he entered a [[Jesuit]] [[seminary]], though he was turned away within weeks because of the health requirement and what the director and doctor of the seminary described as a [[psychosomatic]] heart condition. Heidegger was short and sinewy, with dark piercing eyes. He enjoyed outdoor pursuits, being especially proficient at skiing.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Philipse, ''Heidegger's Philosophy of Being'' p. 173, Notes to Chapter One, Martin Heidegger, ''Supplements'', trans. John Van Buren p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studying theology at the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität|University of Freiburg]] while supported by the church, later he switched his field of study to philosophy. Heidegger completed his doctoral thesis on [[psychologism]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;''Die Lehre vom Urteil im Psychologismus. Ein kritisch-theoretischer Beitrag zur Logik'' [''The Doctrine of Judgment in Psychologism: A Critical-theoretical Contribution to Logic''] (1914). Source: Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert, "Martin Heidegger", ''Theologische Realenzyklopädie'', XIV, 1982, p. 562. Now his thesis is included in: M. Heidegger, ''Frühe Schriften'', Frankfurt-am-Main: Vittorio Klostermann, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by [[Neo-Thomism]] and [[Neo-Kantianism]], directed by [[Arthur Schneider (philosopher)|Arthur Schneider]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Kockelmans, ''Phenomenology and the Natural Sciences: Essays and Translations'', Northwestern University Press, 1970, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, he finished his ''[[venia legendi]]'' with a [[habilitation thesis]] on [[Duns Scotus]]&lt;ref&gt;Note, however, that it was discovered later that one of the two main sources used by Heidegger was not by Scotus, but by [[Thomas of Erfurt]]. Thus Heidegger's 1916 habilitation thesis, ''Die Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus'' [''Duns Scotus's Doctrine of categories and Meaning''], should have been entitled, ''Die Kategorienlehre des Duns Scotus und die Bedeutungslehre des Thomas von Erfurt''. Source: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/erfurt ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'': "Thomas Erfurt"].&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Heinrich Rickert]]&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Luft (ed.), ''The Neo-Kantian Reader'', Routledge 2015, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; and influenced by [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Alfieri, ''The Presence of Duns Scotus in the Thought of Edith Stein: The Question of Individuality'', Springer, 2015, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the two years following, he worked first as an unsalaried [[Privatdozent]] then served as a soldier during the final year of [[World War I]]; serving "the last ten months of the war" with "the last three of those in a meteorological unit on the [[Western Front (World War I)|western front]]".&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;

===Marburg===
In 1923, Heidegger was elected to an [[Professor#Main positions 2|extraordinary Professorship]] in Philosophy at the [[University of Marburg]]. His colleagues there included [[Rudolf Bultmann]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]], and [[Paul Natorp]]. Heidegger's students at Marburg included [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Gerhard Krüger (philosopher)|Gerhard Krüger]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]], [[Günther Anders|Gunther (Stern) Anders]], and [[Hans Jonas]]. Following on from [[Aristotle]], he began to develop in his lectures the main theme of his philosophy: the question of the sense of being. He extended the concept of subject to the dimension of history and concrete [[existence]], which he found prefigured in such Christian thinkers as [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Martin Luther|Luther]], and [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]. He also read the works of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], Husserl, [[Max Scheler]],&lt;ref&gt;Gethmann-Siefert, 1982, p. 563&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

===Freiburg===
In 1927, Heidegger published his main work ''Sein und Zeit'' (''Being and Time''). When Husserl retired as Professor of Philosophy in 1928, Heidegger accepted Freiburg's election to be his successor, in spite of a counter-offer by Marburg. Heidegger remained at [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] for the rest of his life, declining a number of later offers, including one from [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. His students at Freiburg included Arendt, [[Günther Anders]], [[Hans Jonas]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Charles Malik]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Ernst Nolte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolin|first=Richard|author-link= Richard Wolin|title=Heidegger's Children: Hannah Arendt, Karl Löwith, Hans Jonas, and Herbert Marcuse |publisher=[[Princeton University]] Press |date=2015 |pages=|chapter= |isbn=9780691168616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=|first=|editor-last= Fleischacker  |editor-first= Samuel  |title=Heidegger's Jewish Followers: Essays on Hannah Arendt, Leo Strauss, Hans Jonas, and Emmanuel Levinas  |publisher=[[Duquesne University]] Press |date=August 2008 |pages=|chapter= |isbn=978-0820704128}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emmanuel Levinas]] attended his lecture courses during his stay in Freiburg in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinfels|first=Peter |date=27 December 1995|title=Emmanuel Levinas, 90, French Ethical Philosopher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/27/world/emmanuel-levinas-90-french-ethical-philosopher.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger was elected rector of the University on 21 April 1933, and joined the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' (Nazi) Party]] on 1 May.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Bambach, Heidegger’s Roots (Cornell University Press, 2003, page 82)&lt;/ref&gt; In his inaugural address as rector on 27 May he expressed his support of a German revolution, and in an article and a speech to the students from the same year he also supported Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref name=young/&gt;{{rp|3}}{{rp|11}}  

In November 1933, Heidegger signed the ''[[w:de:Bekenntnis der deutschen Professoren zu Adolf Hitler|Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State]]''. He resigned the rectorate in April 1934, but remained a member of the Nazi Party until 1945 even though (as Julian Young asserts) the Nazis eventually prevented him from publishing.&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{cite book |last=Young|first=Julian |author-link=Julian Young|title=Heidegger, Philosophy, Nazism  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1998|chapter= |isbn=978-0521644945}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} In the autumn of 1944, Heidegger was drafted into the ''[[Volkssturm]]'', assigned to dig anti-tank ditches along the [[Rhine]].&lt;ref name=fell&gt;{{cite news |last=Inwood |first=Michael |date=12 April 2014 |title=Martin Heidegger: the philosopher who fell for Hitler|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10739165/Martin-Heidegger-the-philosopher-who-fell-for-Hitler.html |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Richard J. Evans]], Heidegger was not only a member of the Nazi Party, but "enthusiastic" about participating. He wanted to position himself as the philosopher of the Party, but the highly abstract nature of his work and the opposition of [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who himself aspired to act in that position, limited Heidegger's role. His resignation from the rectorate owed more to his frustration as an administrator than to any principled opposition to the Nazis, according to historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Evans |first=Richard J.|author-link=Richard J.

Heidegger's ''[[Black Notebooks]]'', written between 1931 and 1941 and first published in 2014, contain several expressions of [[anti-semitic]] sentiments, which have led to a re-evaluation of [[Martin Heidegger and Nazism|Heidegger's relation to Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Das vergiftete Erbe|last=Assheuer|first=Thomas|author-link=:de:Thomas Assheuer  |url= http://www.zeit.de/2014/12/heidegger-schwarze-hefte-veroeffentlicht|newspaper=[[Die Zeit]] |work= |date=21 March 2014|language=German|trans-title=The poisoned heritage|access-date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war===
In late 1946, as France engaged in ''[[épuration légale]]'' in its [[Occupation of Germany|Occupation zone]], the French military authorities determined that Heidegger should be blocked from teaching or participating in any university activities because of his association with the Nazi Party.&lt;ref&gt;Provisional ruling October 5, 1946; final ruling December 28, 1946; Hugo Ott, Martin Heidegger: A Political Life, (Harper Collins, 1993, page 348)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[denazification]] procedures against Heidegger continued until March 1949 when he was finally pronounced a ''[[Mitläufer]]'' (the second lowest of five categories of "incrimination" by association with the Nazi regime). No punitive measures against him were proposed.&lt;ref name="Rüdiger Safranski" /&gt; This opened the way for his readmission to teaching at Freiburg University in the winter semester of 1950–51.&lt;ref name="Rüdiger Safranski"&gt;Rüdiger Safranski, Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil (Harvard University Press, 1998, page 373)&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted emeritus status and then taught regularly from 1951 until 1958, and by invitation until 1967.

===Personal life===
[[File:Heideggerrundweg0009.JPG|thumb|left|Heidegger's stone-and-tile chalet clustered among others at Todtnauberg]]

Heidegger married Elfride Petri on 21 March 1917, in a Catholic ceremony officiated by his friend {{Interlanguage link multi|Engelbert Krebs|de|lt=Engelbert Krebs}}, and a week later in a Protestant ceremony in the presence of her parents. Their first son, Jörg, was born in 1919. Elfride then gave birth to {{Interlanguage link multi|Hermann Heidegger|de|lt=Hermann}} in 1920. Heidegger knew that he was not Hermann's biological father but raised him as his son. Hermann's biological father, who became godfather to his son, was family friend and doctor Friedel Caesar. Hermann was told of this at the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0745641369.html|title=Letters to his Wife: 1915 - 1970|date=11 December 2009|website=Wiley.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermann became a historian and would later serve as the executor of Heidegger's will.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Es ist wieder da|url = http://www.zeit.de/2014/05/martin-heidegger-schwarze-hefte/komplettansicht|newspaper = Die Zeit|date = 30 January 2014|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger had a long romantic relationship with [[Hannah Arendt]] and a steamy affair (over many decades) with [[Elisabeth Blochmann]], both students of his. Arendt was [[Jewish]], and Blochmann had one Jewish parent, making them subject to severe [[History of the Jews in Germany|persecution by the Nazi authorities]]. He helped Blochmann emigrate from Germany before the start of World War II and resumed contact with both of them after the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Martin Heidegger / Elisabeth Blochmann.

Marbach am Neckar: Deutsches Literatur-Archiv, 1989, 2nd edn. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's letters to his wife contain information about several other affairs of his.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Heidegger spent much time at his vacation home at [[Todtnauberg]], on the edge of the [[Black Forest]]. He considered the seclusion provided by the forest to be the best environment in which to engage in philosophical thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/25/durantaye.php Being There], a Spring 2007 article on Heidegger's vacation home for ''[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months before his death, he met with Bernhard Welte, a Catholic priest, Freiburg university professor and earlier correspondent. The exact nature of the conversation is not known, but what is known is that it included talk of Heidegger's relationship to the [[Catholic Church]] and subsequent Christian burial at which the priest officiated.&lt;ref&gt;Emad, Parvis.

==Philosophy==
{{Confusing section|reason=the language is obfuscatory and the logical sequence between one sentence and the next is obscure throughout|date=September 2018}}

===Being, time, and ''Dasein''===
Heidegger's philosophy is founded on the attempt to conjoin what he considers two fundamental insights: the first is his observation that, in the course of over 2,000 years of history, philosophy has attended to all the beings that can be found in the world (including the world itself), but has forgotten to ask what Being itself is. Heidegger thought the presence of things for us is not their being, but merely them interpreted as equipment according to a particular system of meaning and purpose. For instance, when a hammer is efficiently used to knock in nails, we cease to be aware of it. This is termed "ready to hand", and Heidegger considers it an authentic mode, saying that the given ("past") has presence in an oversimplified way when reduced to possible future usefulness to us.

Heidegger claimed philosophy and science since ancient Greece had reduced things to their presence, which was a superficial way of understanding them. One crucial source of this insight was Heidegger's reading of [[Franz Brentano]]'s treatise on Aristotle's manifold uses of the word "being", a work which provoked Heidegger to ask what kind of unity underlies this multiplicity of uses. Heidegger opens his magnum opus, ''Being and Time'', with a citation from [[Plato]]'s ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]''&lt;ref&gt;For a study on Heidegger's reading of the ''Sophist'' and his less central interest in Plato's ''Timaeus'' and its conception of ''space'' qua ''khôra'': see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], "''On kai khôra'': Situating Heidegger between the ''Sophist'' and the ''Timaeus''", ''Studia Phaenomenologica'', Vol. IV, Issue 1–2 (2004), pp. 73–98.  This study is also closely connected with an investigation of Heidegger's later reflections on 'dwelling' as set in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger’s Reflections on Dwelling', Environment, Space, Place 3 (2011), pp. 47–71.  Refer also to other aspects of this research under the section of 'Heidegger and Eastern Thought', and also the influence on architectural thinking in the main body of the text above&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that Western philosophy has neglected Being because it was considered too obvious to question. Heidegger's intuition about the question of Being is thus a historical argument, which in his later work becomes his concern with the "history of Being", that is, the history of the forgetting of Being, which according to Heidegger requires that philosophy retrace its footsteps through a productive [[Heideggerian terminology|destruction]] of the history of philosophy.

The second intuition animating Heidegger's philosophy derives from the influence of [[Edmund Husserl]], a philosopher largely uninterested in questions of philosophical history. Rather, Husserl argued that all that philosophy could and should be is a description of experience (hence the phenomenological slogan, "to the things themselves"). But for Heidegger, this meant understanding that experience is [[world disclosure|always already situated in a world]] and in ways of being. Thus Husserl's understanding that all consciousness is "[[intentionality|intentional]]" (in the sense that it is always intended ''toward'' something, and is always "about" something) is transformed in Heidegger's philosophy, becoming the thought that all experience is grounded in "care". This is the basis of Heidegger's "existential analytic", as he develops it in ''Being and Time''. Heidegger argues that describing experience properly entails finding the being for whom such a description might matter. Heidegger thus conducts his description of experience with reference to "''[[Dasein]]''", the being for whom Being is a question. In everyday German, "''Dasein''" means "existence." It is composed of "''Da''" (here/there) and "''Sein''" (being). ''Dasein'' is transformed in Heidegger's usage from its everyday meaning to refer, rather, to that being that is ''there'' in its world, that is, the being for whom being matters.{{Incomprehensible inline|date=September 2018}} In later publications Heidegger writes the term in hyphenated form as ''Da-sein'', thus emphasizing the distance from the word's ordinary usage.

In ''Being and Time'', Heidegger criticized the abstract and metaphysical character of traditional ways of grasping human existence as rational animal, person, man, soul, spirit, or subject. ''Dasein'', then, is not intended as a way of conducting a [[philosophical anthropology]], but is rather understood by Heidegger to be the condition of possibility for anything ''like'' a philosophical anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida describes this in the following terms: "We can see then that Dasein, though ''not'' man, is nevertheless ''nothing other'' than man." Jacques Derrida, "The Ends of Man", ''Margins of Philosophy'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dasein'', according to Heidegger, ''is'' care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blair|first1=Michael|title="Heidegger and Aquinas on the Self as Substance", in Postmodernism and Christian Philosophy edited by Roman Theodore Ciapalo|date=1997|publisher=Amer Maritain Assoc|location=Mishawaka IN|isbn=978-0813208817|pages=39–46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQneikLwaMoC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Dasein,+according+to+Heidegger,+is+care&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjM8sHa6MXTAhUmxoMKHXXlDqwQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Dasein%2C%20according%20to%20Heidegger%2C%20is%20care&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of his existential analytic, Heidegger argues that ''Dasein'', who finds itself [[thrownness|thrown into the world]] (''Geworfenheit'') amidst things and with others, is thrown into its possibilities,{{Incomprehensible inline|date=September 2018}} including the possibility and inevitability of one's own mortality. The need for ''Dasein'' to assume these possibilities, that is, the need to be responsible for one's own existence, is the basis of Heidegger's notions of authenticity and resoluteness—that is, of those specific possibilities for ''Dasein'' which depend on escaping the "vulgar" temporality of calculation and of public life.

The marriage of these two observations depends on the fact that each of them is essentially concerned with time. That ''Dasein'' is thrown into an already existing world and thus into its mortal possibilities does not only mean that ''Dasein'' is an essentially temporal being; it also implies that the description of ''Dasein'' can only be carried out in terms inherited from the Western tradition itself. For Heidegger, unlike for Husserl, philosophical terminology could not be divorced from the history of the use of that terminology, and thus genuine philosophy could not avoid confronting questions of language and meaning. The existential analytic of ''Being and Time'' was thus always only a first step in Heidegger's philosophy, to be followed by the "dismantling" (''Destruktion'') of the history of philosophy, that is, a transformation of its language and meaning, that would have made of the existential analytic only a kind of "limit case" (in the sense in which special relativity is a limit case of general relativity).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

That Heidegger did not write this second part of ''Being and Time'', and that the existential analytic was left behind in the course of Heidegger's subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of ''individual'' experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the ''collective'' human adventure that he understands the Western philosophical tradition to be. And this would in turn raise the question of whether this failure is due to a flaw in Heidegger's account of temporality, that is, of whether Heidegger was correct to oppose vulgar and authentic time.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Bernard Stiegler]], "Technics of Decision: An Interview", ''Angelaki'' 8 (2003), pp. 154–67, and cf. the discussion of Stiegler's reading of Heidegger in the sub-section "Bernard Stiegler" below.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also recent critiques in this regard that were directed at Heidegger's focus on time instead of primarily thinking about being in relation to place and space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = El-Bizri | first1 = Nader | authorlink = Nader El-Bizri | year = 2004 | title = On Kai [[Khora]]'': Situating Heidegger between the ''Sophist'' and the ''Timaeus'' | url = | journal = Studia Phaenomenologica | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 73–98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the notion of dwelling,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger’s Reflections on Dwelling', ''Environment, Space, Place'' 3 (2011), 47–71&lt;/ref&gt; with connections too to [[architectural theory]] as impacted by [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = El-Bizri | first1 = Nader | authorlink = Nader El-Bizri | year = 2015 | title = On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology | url = http://studia.ubbcluj.ro/download/pdf/920.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Studia UBB Philosophia | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 5–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Being and Time''===
[[File:Heideggerrundweg0013.JPG|thumb|left|View from Heidegger's vacation chalet in Todtnauberg. Heidegger wrote most of ''Being and Time'' there.]]
{{Main|Being and Time}}

''Being and Time'' (German title: ''Sein und Zeit''), published in 1927, was Heidegger's first academic book. He had been under pressure to publish in order to qualify for Husserl's (to whom he dedicated the work) chair at the [[University of Freiburg]] and the success of this work ensured his appointment to the post.

In ''Being and Time'', Heidegger investigates the question of [[Being]] by asking about the being for whom Being is a question. Heidegger names this being ''Dasein'' (see above), and he pursues his investigation through themes such as mortality, [[Heideggerian terminology#Care or Concern|care]], anxiety, temporality, and historicity. It was Heidegger's original intention to write a second half of the book, consisting of a "''Destruktion''" of the history of philosophy—that is, the transformation of philosophy by re-tracing its history—but he never completed this project.

''Being and Time'' influenced many thinkers, including such existentialist thinkers as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (although Heidegger distanced himself from [[existentialism]]—see below).

Such is the case with the work of [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] and the philosopher-architect [[Nader El-Bizri]].)&lt;ref&gt;Refer to a recent study on [[Heidegger]]'s conception of "dwelling" as set in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]]', [http://studia.ubbcluj.ro/download/pdf/920.pdf ''Studia UBB Philosophia'' 60 (2015): 5-30].

For example, in 2011 [[Mark Wrathall]]&lt;ref&gt;Wrathall, Mark:  Heidegger and Unconcealment: Truth, Language, and History, Cambridge University Press, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Heidegger pursued and refined the central notion of unconcealment throughout his life as a philosopher. Its importance and continuity in his thinking, Wrathall states, shows that he did not have a "turn". A reviewer of Wrathall's book stated: "An ontology of unconcealment [...] means a description and analysis of the broad contexts in which entities show up as meaningful to us, as well as the conditions under which such contexts, or worlds, emerge and fade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/heidegger-and-unconcealment-truth-language-and-history/|title=Review of Heidegger and Unconcealment: Truth, Language, and History|first=Stephan|last=Käufer|date=2 July 2011|publisher=|via=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger focuses less on the way in which the structures of being are revealed in everyday behavior, and more on the way in which behaviour itself depends on a prior "openness to being." The essence of being human is the maintenance of this openness.{{Incomprehensible inline|date=September 2018}} Heidegger contrasts this openness to the "will to power" of the modern human subject, which is one way of forgetting this originary openness.

Heidegger understands the commencement of the history of Western philosophy as a brief period of authentic openness to being, during the time of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]], especially [[Anaximander]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Parmenides]]. This was followed, according to Heidegger, by a long period increasingly dominated by the forgetting of this initial openness, a period which commences with [[Plato]], and which occurs in different ways throughout Western history.

Two recurring themes of Heidegger's later writings are poetry and technology. Heidegger sees poetry and technology as two contrasting ways of "[[world disclosure|revealing]]." Poetry reveals being in the way in which, if it is genuine poetry, it commences something new. Technology, on the other hand, when it gets going, inaugurates the world of the dichotomous subject and object, which modern philosophy commencing with Descartes also reveals. But with ''modern'' technology a new stage of revealing is reached, in which the subject-object distinction is overcome even in the "material" world of technology. The essence of modern technology is the conversion of the whole universe of beings into an undifferentiated "standing reserve" (''Bestand'') of energy available for any use to which humans choose to put it.{{Incomprehensible inline|date=September 2018}} Heidegger described the essence of modern technology as ''[[Gestell]]'', or "enframing." Heidegger does not unequivocally condemn technology: while he acknowledges that modern technology contains grave dangers, Heidegger nevertheless also argues that it may constitute a chance for human beings to enter a new epoch in their relation to being. Despite this, some commentators have insisted that an agrarian nostalgia permeates his later work.&lt;ref&gt;Refer in this context to reflections on [[Heidegger]]'s conception of "dwelling" against the background of ''Gestell'' as set in:{{cite journal | last1 = El-Bizri | first1 = Nader | authorlink = Nader El-Bizri | year = 2015 | title = On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology | url = http://studia.ubbcluj.ro/download/pdf/920.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Studia UBB Philosophia | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 5–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1950 lecture he formulated the famous saying "[[Language speaks]]", later published in the 1959 essays collection ''Unterwegs zur Sprache'', and collected in the 1971 English book ''Poetry, Language, Thought''.&lt;ref name="Lyon06"&gt;Lyon, James K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vB_Tv7A9oI8C ''Paul Celan and Martin Heidegger: an unresolved conversation, 1951–1970''], pp. 128–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Philipse98"&gt;Philipse, Herman (1998) ''Heidegger's philosophy of being: a critical interpretation'', p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger (1971) ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', translation and introduction by Albert Hofstadter, pp. xxv and 187ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger's later works include ''Vom Wesen der Wahrheit'' ("On the Essence of Truth", 1930), ''Der Ursprung des Kunstwerkes'' ("[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]", 1935), ''Einführung in die Metaphysik'' ("[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Heidegger)|Introduction to Metaphysics]]", 1935),  ''Bauen Wohnen Denken'' ("Building Dwelling Thinking", 1951), and ''Die Frage nach der Technik'' ("[[The Question Concerning Technology]]", 1954) and ''Was heisst Denken?'' (''[[What Is Called Thinking?]]'' 1954). Also  ''Beiträge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis)'' (''[[Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)]]''), composed in the years 1936–38 but not published until 1989, on the centennial of Heidegger's birth.

===Heidegger and the ground of History===
Heidegger believed the Western world to be on a trajectory headed for total war,&lt;ref name=War&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=Michael Allen|title=Hegel, Heidegger, and the Ground of History|year=1984|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|location=The start of the 3rd paragraph|isbn=0-226-29377-7|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the brink of profound [[nihilism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=Michael Allen|title=Hegel, Heidegger, and the Ground of History|year=1984|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=2nd half|isbn=0-226-29377-7|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the rejection of all religious and moral principles),&lt;ref name=Nihilism&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary|year=1991|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Bottom of page|isbn=  978-0198612483|pages=984|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Oxford-Encyclopedic-English-Dictionary/dp/0198612486}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be the purest and highest revelation of Being itself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=Michael Allen|title=Hegel, Heidegger, and the Ground of History|year=1984|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=End of 1st paragraph|isbn=0-226-29377-7|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering a horrifying crossroads of either salvation or the end of [[metaphysics]] and [[modernity]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=Michael Allen|title=Hegel, Heidegger, and the Ground of History|year=1984|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=End of 2nd paragraph|isbn=0-226-29377-7|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; rendering the West a wasteland populated by tool-using brutes, characterized by an unprecedented ignorance and barbarism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=Michael Allen|title=Hegel, Heidegger, and the Ground of History|year=1984|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Near end of 3rd paragraph.|isbn=0-226-29377-7|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which everything is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=Michael Allen|title=Hegel, Heidegger, and the Ground of History|year=1984|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Halfway through 2nd paragraph|isbn=0-226-29377-7|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He envisaged this abyss to be the greatest event in the West's history because it would enable Humanity to comprehend Being more profoundly and primordially than the [[Pre-Socratics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=Michael Allen|title=Hegel, Heidegger, and the Ground of History|year=1984|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=End of 1st paragraph|isbn=0-226-29377-7|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===

====St. Augustine of Hippo====
Recent scholarship has shown that Heidegger was substantially influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] and that ''Being and Time'' would not have been possible without the influence of Augustine's thought. Augustine's  ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' was particularly influential in shaping Heidegger's thought.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Influence of Augustine on Heidegger: The Emergence of an Augustinian Phenomenology'', ed. Craig J. N. de Paulo (Lewiston: The Edwin Mellen Press, 2006.) and also ''Martin Heidegger's Interpretations of Augustine: Sein und Zeit und Ewigkeit'', ed. Frederick Van Fleteren (Lewiston: The Edwin Mellen Press, 2005.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine viewed time as relative and subjective, and that being and time were bound up together.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo (2008). ''Confessions''. Chadwick, Henry transl. New York: Oxford University Press, Book XI&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger adopted similar views, e.g. that time was the horizon of Being: ' ...time temporalizes itself only as long as there are human beings.'&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Metaphysics'', trans. by Gregory Fried and Richard Polt (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aristotle and the Greeks====
Heidegger was influenced at an early age by Aristotle, mediated through Catholic [[theology]], [[medieval philosophy]] and [[Franz Brentano]]. Aristotle's ethical, logical, and metaphysical works were crucial to the development of his thought in the crucial period of the 1920s. Although he later worked less on Aristotle, Heidegger recommended postponing reading Nietzsche, and to "first study Aristotle for ten to fifteen years".&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, ''[[What is Called Thinking?]]'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1968), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In reading Aristotle, Heidegger increasingly contested the traditional Latin translation and scholastic interpretation of his thought. Particularly important (not least for its influence upon others, both in their interpretation of Aristotle and in rehabilitating a neo-Aristotelian "practical philosophy")&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2007). {{pages needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was his radical reinterpretation of Book Six of Aristotle's ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and several books of the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''. Both informed the argument of ''Being and Time''. Heidegger's thought is original in being an authentic retrieval of the past, a repetition of the possibilities handed down by the tradition.&lt;ref name="Sikka1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sonya Sikka|title=Forms of Transcendence: Heidegger and Medieval Mystical Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNYIDrA0zrYC&amp;pg=PA265|year=1997|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3345-4|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of asking about [[being]] may be traced back via Aristotle to [[Parmenides]]. Heidegger claimed to have revived the question of being, the question having been largely forgotten by the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] tradition extending from [[Plato]] to [[Descartes]], a forgetfulness extending to the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and then to modern science and technology. In pursuit of the retrieval of this question, Heidegger spent considerable time reflecting on [[Greek philosophy|ancient Greek thought]], in particular on Plato, [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]], and Anaximander, as well as on the tragic playwright [[Sophocles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.alfredstate.edu/library/Antigone/Antigone.The%20Ode%20on%20Man.pdf "The Ode on Man in Sophocles' Antigone"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611205518/http://web.alfredstate.edu/library/Antigone/Antigone.The%20Ode%20on%20Man.pdf |date=2012-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dilthey====
Heidegger's very early project of developing a "hermeneutics of [[Facticity|factical]] life" and his hermeneutical transformation of phenomenology was influenced in part by his reading of the works of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ROCKMORE|first=Tom|year=2003|title=DILTHEY AND HISTORICAL REASON|jstor=23955847|journal=Revue Internationale de Philosophie|volume=57|pages=477–494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the influence of Dilthey, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] writes the following: "As far as Dilthey is concerned, we all know today what I have known for a long time: namely that it is a mistake to conclude on the basis of the citation in ''Being and Time'' that Dilthey was especially influential in the development of Heidegger's thinking in the mid-1920s. This dating of the influence is much too late." He adds that by the fall of 1923 it was plain that Heidegger felt "the clear superiority of [[Paul Yorck von Wartenburg|Count Yorck]] over the famous scholar, Dilthey." Gadamer nevertheless makes clear that Dilthey's influence was important in helping the youthful Heidegger "in distancing himself from the systematic ideal of Neo-Kantianism, as Heidegger acknowledges in ''Being and Time''."&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Gadamer, "Martin Heidegger's One Path", in Theodore Kisiel &amp; John van Buren (eds.), ''Reading Heidegger from the Start: Essays in His Earliest Thought'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), pp. 22–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Heidegger's earliest lecture courses, in which Heidegger already engages Dilthey's thought prior to the period Gadamer mentions as "too late", scholars as diverse as [[Theodore Kisiel]] and [[David Farrell Krell]] have argued for the importance of Diltheyan concepts and strategies in the formation of Heidegger's thought.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Genesis of Heidegger's Being and Time'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), Theodor Kisiel designates the first version of the project that culminates in ''Being and Time'', "the Dilthey draft" (p. 313). David Farrell Krell comments in ''Daimon Life: Heidegger and Life-Philosophy'' (Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1992) that "Heidegger's project sprouts (in part, but in ''good'' part) from the soil of Dilthey's philosophy of factical-historical life" (p. 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Gadamer's interpretation of Heidegger has been questioned, there is little doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a ''gestalt'' formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the [[hermeneutic circle]] offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Eric S.|title="Heidegger and Dilthey: Language, History, and Hermeneutics", in Horizons of Authenticity in Phenomenology, Existentialism, and Moral Psychology, edited by Hans Pedersen and Megan Altman|date=2014|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-9401794411|pages=109–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Husserl====
There is disagreement over the degree of influence that [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] had on Heidegger's philosophical development, just as there is disagreement about the degree to which Heidegger's philosophy is grounded in phenomenology. These disagreements centre upon how much of Husserlian phenomenology is contested by Heidegger, and how much this phenomenology in fact informs Heidegger's own understanding.

On the relation between the two figures, Gadamer wrote: "When asked about phenomenology, Husserl was quite right to answer as he used to in the period directly after World War I: 'Phenomenology, that is me and Heidegger'." Nevertheless, Gadamer noted that Heidegger was no patient collaborator with Husserl, and that Heidegger's "rash ascent to the top, the incomparable fascination he aroused, and his stormy temperament surely must have made Husserl, the patient one, as suspicious of Heidegger as he always had been of [[Max Scheler]]'s volcanic fire."&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Gadamer, "Martin Heidegger—75 Years", ''Heidegger's Ways'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert J. Dostal understood the importance of Husserl to be profound:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Heidegger himself, who is supposed to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, we will not be able to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in ''Being and Time'' or why he left it unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Dostal, "Time and Phenomenology in Husserl and Heidegger", in Charles Guignon (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Daniel O. Dahlstrom saw Heidegger's presentation of his work as a departure from Husserl as unfairly misrepresenting Husserl's own work. Dahlstrom concluded his consideration of the relation between Heidegger and Husserl as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Heidegger's silence about the stark similarities between his account of temporality and Husserl's investigation of internal time-consciousness contributes to a ''misrepresentation'' of Husserl's account of intentionality. Contrary to the criticisms Heidegger advances in his lectures, intentionality (and, by implication, the meaning of 'to be') in the final analysis is not construed by Husserl as sheer presence (be it the presence of a fact or object, act or event). Yet for all its "dangerous closeness" to what Heidegger understands by temporality, Husserl's account of internal time-consciousness does differ fundamentally. In Husserl's account the structure of protentions is accorded neither the finitude nor the primacy that Heidegger claims are central to the original future of ecstatic-horizonal temporality.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel O. Dahlstrom, "Heidegger's Critique of Husserl", in Theodore Kisiel &amp; John van Buren (eds.), ''Reading Heidegger from the Start: Essays in His Earliest Thought'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Kierkegaard====
Heideggerians regarded [[Søren Kierkegaard]] as, by far, the greatest philosophical contributor to Heidegger's own existentialist concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Hubert. ''Being-in-the-world: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I.''  (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1991), Sec. Appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's concepts of anxiety (''[[Angst]]'') and mortality draw on Kierkegaard and are indebted to the way in which the latter lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence, and the importance of passionate affirmation of one's individual [[being-in-the-world]].&lt;ref&gt;A recent study touches specifically on the ontological aspects of angst from a Heideggerian standpoint and the nuances that distinguish it in a radical way from the take on ''anguish'' in Kierkegaard's thought, see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], ‘Variations ontologiques autour du concept d’angoisse chez Kierkegaard’, in ''Kierkegaard notre contemporain paradoxal'' (Beirut, 2013), pp. 83–95&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hölderlin and Nietzsche====
[[Friedrich Hölderlin]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were both important influences on Heidegger,&lt;ref&gt;Historical Dictionary of Heidegger's Philosophy, By Frank Schalow, Alfred Denker&lt;/ref&gt; and many of his lecture courses were devoted to one or the other, especially in the 1930s and 1940s. The lectures on Nietzsche focused on fragments posthumously published under the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', rather than on Nietzsche's published works. Heidegger read ''The Will to Power'' as the culminating expression of Western metaphysics, and the lectures are a kind of dialogue between the two thinkers.

The fundamental differences between the philosophical delineations of Heidegger and [[Adorno]] can be found in their contrasting views of Hölderlin's poetical works and to a lesser extent in their divergent views on [[German romanticism]] in general. For Heidegger, Hölderlin expressed the intuitive necessity of metaphysical concepts as a guide for ethical paradigms, devoid of reflection. Adorno, on the other hand, pointed to the dialectic reflection of historical situations, the sociological interpretations of future outcomes, and therefore opposed the liberating principles of intuitive concepts because they negatively surpassed the perception of societal realities.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Garbrecht (1999). (Dissertation Universität München). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1SlXtJuuOYwC&amp;pg=PA287 ''Rationalitätskritik der Moderne – Adorno und Heidegger'']. p. 269. Herbert Utz Verlag – Wissenschaft. {{ISBN|3-89675-652-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was Heidegger's rationalization and later work on Hölderlin's poems as well as on [[Parmenides]] ("For to be aware and to be are the same," [[Diels–Kranz numbering|DK]] B 3) and his consistent understanding of Nietzsche's thought that formed the foundation of [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger (1954). Was heisst denken? p. 6-86. Max Niemeyer Verlag Tübingen. {{ISBN|3-484-70029-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also the case for the lecture courses devoted to the poetry of Friedrich Hölderlin, which became an increasingly central focus of Heidegger's work and thought. Heidegger grants to Hölderlin a singular place within the history of being and the history of Germany, as a herald whose thought is yet to be "heard" in Germany or the West. Many of Heidegger's works from the 1930s onwards include meditations on lines from Hölderlin's poetry, and several of the lecture courses are devoted to the reading of a single poem (see, for example, ''[[Hölderlin's Hymn "The Ister"]]'').

===Heidegger and Eastern thought===
Some writers on Heidegger's work see possibilities within it for dialogue with traditions of thought outside of Western philosophy, particularly East Asian thinking. Despite perceived differences between Eastern and Western philosophy, some of Heidegger's later work, particularly "A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer", does show an interest in initiating such a dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer", in ''On the Way to Language'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger himself had contact with a number of leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the [[Kyoto School]], notably [[Hajime Tanabe]] and [[Kuki Shūzō]].  It has also been claimed that a number of elements within Heidegger's thought bear a close parallel to Eastern philosophical ideas, particularly [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]]. Reinhard May refers to Chang Chung-Yuan who stated "Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands Tao, but has intuitively experienced the essence of it as well."&lt;ref&gt;''Tao - A New Way Of Thinking: A Translation of the Tao Tê Ching with an Introduction and Commentaries'' by Chung-yuan Chang, p. 8. 1977. London and Philadelphia: Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; May sees great influence of Taoism and Japanese scholars in Heidegger's work, although this influence is not acknowledged by the author. He asserts: "The investigation concludes that Heidegger’s work was significantly influenced by East Asian sources. It can be shown, moreover, that in particular instances Heidegger even appropriated wholesale and almost verbatim major ideas from the German translations of Daoist and Zen Buddhist classics. This clandestine textual appropriation of non-Western spirituality, the extent of which has gone undiscovered for so long, seems quite unparalleled, with far-reaching implications for our future interpretation of Heidegger’s work."&lt;ref&gt;''Heidegger's hidden sources: East Asian influences on his work'' by Reinhard May, p. XV. Translated, with a complementary essay, by Graham Parkes. 1996. London and New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
Heidegger has been influential in research on the relationship between Western philosophy and the history of ideas in [[Islam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsozkult.de/event/id/termine-30611|title=Heidegger in the Islamicate World|website=H-Soz-Kult. Kommunikation und Fachinformation für die Geschichtswissenschaften}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for some scholars interested in Arabic philosophical medieval sources. These include the [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] philosopher and architectural theorist [[Nader El-Bizri]],&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: [[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest between [[Avicenna]] and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000); [[Nader El-Bizri]], '[[Avicenna]] and Essentialism', ''Review of Metaphysics'' 2001; 54, 753–778; [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Being and Necessity: A Phenomenological Investigation of Avicenna's Metaphysics and Cosmology', in ''Islamic Philosophy and Occidental Phenomenology on the Perennial Issue of Microcosm and Macrocosm'', ed.

El-Bizri has also taken a new direction in his engagement in 'Heidegger Studies' by way of probing the Arab/Levantine Anglophone reception of ''Sein und Zeit'' in 1937 as set in the Harvard doctoral thesis of the 20th century Lebanese/Arab thinker and diplomat [[Charles Malik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nightofphilosophy.com/wege-nicht-werke-a-levantine-reception-of-heidegger/|title=Nader El-Bizri, ‘A Levantine Reception  of Heidegger’, Night of Philosophy UNESCO Paris 16 November 2018|website=nightofphilosophy.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also claimed that the works of counter-enlightenment philosophers such as Heidegger, along with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]], influenced Iran's [[Shia]] Islamist scholars, notably [[Ali Shariati]]. A clearer impact of Heidegger in Iran is associated with thinkers such as [[Ahmad Fardid]] and [[Reza Davari Ardakani]] who have been closely associated with the unfolding of philosophical thinking in a Muslim modern theological legacy in Iran. This included the construction of the ideological foundations of the [[Iranian Revolution]] and modern political Islam in its connections with theology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=S95R7trHf9oC&amp;dq "Political Islam, Iran, and the Enlightenment: Philosophies of Hope and Despair"], Ali Mirsepassi.

===Heidegger and architecture===
{{main|Phenomenology (architecture)}}
Heidegger's thought influenced some architectural theorists in a direct manner, or through an impact via his reflections on 'dwelling', the 'origin of the work of art', 'the essence of technology', and the unfolding of a broad interest in [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] within the contemporary circles of [[architectural theory]]. This is for instance evident in the works and profiles of theorists such as [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], [[Dalibor Vesely]], [[Nader El-Bizri]], [[Karsten Harries]], [[Neil Leach]], Adam Sharr, etc., within what is known as Architectural [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] and in contemporary [[architectural theory]] in general.

===The rectorate===
[[File:Universität Freiburg Kollegiengebäude I (Altbau).jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Freiburg]], where Heidegger was Rector from April 21, 1933, to April 23, 1934]]
[[Adolf Hitler]] was sworn in as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] on January 30, 1933. Heidegger was elected [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Freiburg]] on April 21, 1933, and assumed the position the following day. On May 1, he joined the [[Nazi Party]].

Heidegger delivered his inaugural address, the ''Rektoratsrede'', on "Die Selbstbehauptung der Deutschen Universität" ("The Self-assertion of the German University") on 27 May.

His tenure as rector was fraught with difficulties from the outset. Some National Socialist education officials viewed him as a rival, while others saw his efforts as comical. Some of Heidegger's fellow National Socialists also ridiculed his philosophical writings as gibberish. He finally offered his resignation on 23 April 1934, and it was accepted on 27 April. Heidegger remained a member of both the academic faculty and of the Nazi Party until the end of the war.&lt;ref name="Thomas Sheehan"&gt;[[Thomas Sheehan (academic)|Thomas Sheehan]], [https://religiousstudies.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/34-1988-HEIDEGGER-AND-THE-NAZIS-Best.pdf "Heidegger and the Nazis"] ({{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107062318/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/relstud/faculty/sheehan/pdf/88-nazi.PDF |date=2011-11-07}}), a review of Victor Farias' ''Heidegger et le nazisme''. Original article: {{cite news |title=Heidegger and the Nazis |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1988/06/16/heidegger-and-the-nazis |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=16 June 1988 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=38–47 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical historian [[Hans Sluga]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though as rector he prevented students from displaying an anti-Semitic poster at the entrance to the university and from holding a book burning, he kept in close contact with the Nazi student leaders and clearly signaled to them his sympathy with their activism.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Sluga, ''Heidegger's Crisis: Philosophy and Politics in Nazi Germany'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, &amp; London: Harvard University Press, 1993), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1945, Heidegger wrote of his term as rector, giving the writing to his son Hermann; it was published in 1983:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The rectorate was an attempt to see something in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "The Rectorate 1933/34: Facts and Thoughts", in Günther Neske &amp; Emil Kettering (eds.), ''Martin Heidegger and National Socialism: Questions and Answers'' (New York: Paragon House, 1990), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Treatment of Husserl===
Beginning in 1917, German-Jewish philosopher [[Edmund Husserl]] championed Heidegger's work, and helped him secure the retiring Husserl's chair in Philosophy at the University of Freiburg.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f3l7S-ZTK4YC&amp;pg=PA120 Seyla Benhabib, ''The Reluctant Modernism Of Hannah Arendt''] (Rowman and Littlefield, 2003, p. 120.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.essayempire.com/examples/criminal-justice/martin-heidegger-essay/|title=Martin Heidegger Essay ⋆ Criminal Justice Essay Examples ⋆ EssayEmpire|date=2017-05-29|work=EssayEmpire|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 1933, the [[Reichskommissar]] of [[Baden]] Province, Robert Wagner, suspended all Jewish government employees, including present and retired faculty at the University of Freiburg. Heidegger's predecessor as Rector formally notified Husserl of his "enforced leave of absence" on 14 April 1933.

Heidegger became Rector of the University of Freiburg on 22 April 1933. The following week the national Reich law of 28 April 1933, replaced Reichskommissar Wagner's decree.  The Reich law required the firing of Jewish professors from German universities, including those, such as Husserl, who had converted to Christianity. The termination of the retired professor Husserl's academic privileges thus did not involve any specific action on Heidegger's part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonreview.net/BR24.5/benhabib.html#5 Seyla Benhabib, ''The Personal is not the Political''] (October/November 1999 issue of Boston Review.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger had by then broken off contact with Husserl, other than through intermediaries.  Heidegger later claimed that his relationship with Husserl had already become strained after Husserl publicly "settled accounts" with Heidegger and [[Max Scheler]] in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "Der Spiegel Interview", in Günther Neske &amp; Emil Kettering (eds.), ''Martin Heidegger and National Socialism: Questions and Answers'' (New York: Paragon House, 1990), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger did not attend his former mentor's cremation in 1938. In 1941, under pressure from publisher Max Niemeyer, Heidegger agreed to remove the dedication to Husserl from ''Being and Time'' (restored in post-war editions).&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil'' (Cambridge, Mass., &amp; London: Harvard University Press, 1998), pp. 253–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger's behavior towards Husserl has evoked controversy. Arendt initially suggested that Heidegger's behavior precipitated Husserl's death. She called Heidegger a "potential murderer." However, she later recanted her accusation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elzbieta Ettinger]],''Hannah Arendt – Martin Heidegger'', (New Haven, Conn., &amp; London: Yale University Press, 1995), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, only a year after Husserl's death, Heidegger wrote in his ''[[Black Notebooks]]'': "The more original and inceptive the coming decisions and questions become, the more inaccessible will they remain to this [Jewish] 'race'. (Thus, Husserl’s step toward phenomenological observation, and his rejection of psychological explanations and historiological reckoning of opinions, are of enduring importance—yet it never reaches into the domains of essential decisions",&lt;ref&gt;GA 96: 46-47 (from Überlegungen XII, 24) (1939?)&lt;/ref&gt; seeming to imply that Husserl's philosophy was limited purely because he was Jewish.

===Post-rectorate period===
After the failure of Heidegger's rectorship, he withdrew from most political activity, without canceling his membership in the NSDAP (Nazi Party). References to National Socialism continued to appear in his work.

The most controversial such reference occurred during a 1935 lecture which was published in 1953 as part of the book ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Heidegger)|Introduction to Metaphysics]]''. In the published version, Heidegger refers to the "inner truth and greatness" of the National Socialist movement (''die innere Wahrheit und Größe dieser Bewegung''), but he then adds a qualifying statement in parentheses: "namely, the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity" (''nämlich die Begegnung der planetarisch bestimmten Technik und des neuzeitlichen Menschen''). However, it subsequently transpired that this qualification had not been made during the original lecture, although Heidegger claimed that it had been. This has led scholars to argue that Heidegger still supported the Nazi party in 1935 but that he did not want to admit this after the war, and so he attempted to silently correct his earlier statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Habermas | first1 = Jürgen | authorlink = Jürgen Habermas | year = 1989 | title = Work and ''Weltanschauung'': the Heidegger Controversy from a German Perspective | url = | journal = [[Critical Inquiry]] | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 452–54 }} See also [[J. Habermas]], "Martin Heidegger: on the publication of the lectures of 1935", in [[Richard Wolin]], ed., ''The Heidegger Controversy'' ([[MIT Press]], 1993). The controversial page of the 1935 manuscript is missing from the Heidegger Archives in [[Marbach am Neckar|Marbach]]; however, Habermas's scholarship leaves little doubt about the original wording.&lt;/ref&gt;

In private notes written in 1939, Heidegger took a strongly critical view of Hitler's ideology;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Mindfulness'' (Continuum, 2006), section 47.&lt;/ref&gt; however, in public lectures, he seems to have continued to make ambiguous comments which, if they expressed criticism of the regime, did so only in the context of praising its ideals. For instance, in a 1942 lecture, published posthumously, Heidegger said of recent German classics scholarship:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the majority of "research results," the Greeks appear as pure National Socialists. This overenthusiasm on the part of academics seems not even to notice that with such "results" it does National Socialism and its historical uniqueness no service at all, not that it needs this anyhow.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, ''[[Hölderlin's Hymn "The Ister"]]'' (Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: [[Indiana University Press]], 1996), pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important witness to Heidegger's continued allegiance to National Socialism during the post-rectorship period is his former student [[Karl Löwith]], who met Heidegger in 1936 while Heidegger was visiting Rome. In an account set down in 1940 (though not intended for publication), Löwith recalled that Heidegger wore a swastika pin to their meeting, though Heidegger knew that Löwith was Jewish. Löwith also recalled that Heidegger "left no doubt about his faith in [[Hitler]]", and stated that his support for National Socialism was in agreement with the essence of his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Löwith, "My last meeting with Heidegger in Rome", in R. Wolin, ''The Heidegger Controversy'' (MIT Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war period===
After the end of World War II, Heidegger was summoned to appear at a [[denazification]] hearing. Heidegger's former lover [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] spoke on his behalf at this hearing, while [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]] spoke against him. He was charged on four counts, dismissed from the university and declared a "follower" (''[[Mitläufer]]'') of Nazism.&lt;ref name="Thomas Sheehan"/&gt; Heidegger was forbidden to teach between 1945 and 1951. One consequence of this teaching ban was that Heidegger began to engage far more in the French philosophical scene.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dominique Janicaud]], ''Heidegger en France'' vol. 1 (Paris: Albin Michel, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his postwar thinking, Heidegger distanced himself from Nazism, but his critical comments about Nazism seem "scandalous" to some since they tend to equate the Nazi war atrocities with other inhumane practices related to [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] and [[industrialisation]], including the treatment of animals by [[factory farming]]. For instance in a lecture delivered at Bremen in 1949, Heidegger said: "Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs."&lt;ref name="Thomas Sheehan"/&gt;

In 1967 Heidegger met with the Jewish poet [[Paul Celan]], a concentration camp survivor. Celan visited Heidegger at his country retreat and wrote an enigmatic poem about the meeting, which some interpret as Celan's wish for Heidegger to apologize for his behavior during the Nazi era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===''Der Spiegel'' interview===
On 23 September 1966, Heidegger was interviewed by Rudolf Augstein and Georg Wolff for ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine, in which he agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously. (It was published five days after his death, on 31 May 1976.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Rudolf|last1=Augstein|first2=Georg|last2=Wolff|first3=Martin|last3=Heidegger|title=''Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten''|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41238349.html|journal=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=31 May 1976|pages=193–219|accessdate=2013-06-14}} [http://www.ditext.com/heidegger/interview.html English translation] by [[William J. Richardson]] in {{cite book|title=Heidegger. The Man and the Thinker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIrWZajVZuwC&amp;pg=PA45|editor-first=Thomas|editor-last= Sheehan|year=1981|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|location=[[Piscataway, New Jersey]]|pages=45–67|isbn=978-1-412-81537-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview, Heidegger defended his entanglement with National Socialism in two ways: first, he argued that there was no alternative, saying that he was trying to save the university (and science in general) from being politicized and thus had to compromise with the Nazi administration. Second, he admitted that he saw an "awakening" (''Aufbruch'') which might help to find a "new national and social approach," but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, largely prompted by the violence of the [[Night of the Long Knives]].

In his interview Heidegger defended as [[double-speak]] his 1935 lecture describing the "inner truth and greatness of this movement." He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by "movement" he meant National Socialism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was no eulogy for the NSDAP. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthetical clarification later added to ''Introduction to Metaphysics'' (1953), namely, "the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity."

The Löwith account from 1936 has been cited to contradict the account given in the ''Der Spiegel'' interview in two ways: that he did not make any decisive break with National Socialism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement. The ''Der Spiegel'' interviewers did not bring up Heidegger's 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps. In fact, the interviewers were not in possession of much of the evidence now known for Heidegger's Nazi sympathies.&lt;ref name=CI/&gt; ''Der Spiegel'' journalist Georg Wolff had been an [[Hauptsturmführer|SS-Hauptsturmführer]] with the [[Sicherheitsdienst]], stationed in Oslo during World War II, and had been writing articles with antisemitic and racist overtones in ''Der Spiegel'' since war’s end.

==Influence and reception in France==
Heidegger was one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, and his ideas have penetrated into many areas, but in France there is a very long and particular history of reading and interpreting his work which in itself resulted in deepening the impact of his thought in Continental Philosophy.  He influenced [[Jean Beaufret]], [[:fr:François Fédier|François Fédier]], [[Dominique Janicaud]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[:fr:Jean-François Courtine|Jean-François Courtine]] and others.

===Existentialism and pre-war influence===
Heidegger's influence on French philosophy began in the 1930s, when ''Being and Time'', "What is Metaphysics?" and other Heideggerian texts were read by Jean-Paul Sartre and other existentialists, as well as by thinkers such as [[Alexandre Kojève]], [[Georges Bataille]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]].&lt;ref&gt;On the history of the French translation of Heidegger's "What is Metaphysics?", and on its importance to the French intellectual scene, cf. Denis Hollier, "Plenty of Nothing", in Hollier (ed.), ''A New History of French Literature'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1989), pp. 894–900.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Heidegger's discussion of ontology (the study of being) is rooted in an analysis of the mode of existence of individual human beings (''Da-sein'', or there-being), his work has often been associated with existentialism. The influence of Heidegger on Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' is marked, but Heidegger felt that Sartre had misread his work, as he argued in later texts such as the "[[Letter on Humanism]]" In that text, intended for a French audience, Heidegger explained this misreading in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sartre's key proposition about the priority of ''existentia'' over ''essentia''  [that is, Sartre's statement that "existence precedes essence"] does, however, justify using the name "existentialism" as an appropriate title for a philosophy of this sort. But the basic tenet of "existentialism" has nothing at all in common with the statement from ''Being and Time'' [that "the 'essence' of Dasein lies in its existence"]—apart from the fact that in ''Being and Time'' no statement about the relation of ''essentia'' and ''existentia'' can yet be expressed, since there it is still a question of preparing something precursory.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "Letter on Humanism". ''Pathmarks'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 250–1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Letter on 'Humanism'" is often seen as a direct response to Sartre's 1945 lecture "[[Existentialism Is a Humanism]]". Aside from merely disputing readings of his own work, however, in the "Letter on Humanism" Heidegger asserts that "Every humanism is either grounded in a metaphysics or is itself made to be the ground of one."  Heidegger's largest issue with Sartre's existential humanism is that, while it does make a humanistic 'move' in privileging existence over essence, "the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement." From this point onward in his thought, Heidegger attempted to think beyond metaphysics to a place where the articulation of the fundamental questions of ontology were fundamentally possible: only from this point can we restore (that is, re-give [redonner]) any possible meaning to the word "humanism".

===Post-war forays into France===
After the war, Heidegger was banned from university teaching for a period on account of his activities as Rector of Freiburg University. He developed a number of contacts in France, where his work continued to be taught, and a number of French students visited him at [[Todtnauberg]] (see, for example, [[Jean-François Lyotard]]'s brief account in ''Heidegger and "the Jews"'', which discusses a Franco-German conference held in Freiburg in 1947, one step toward bringing together French and German students). Heidegger subsequently made several visits to France, and made efforts to keep abreast of developments in French philosophy by way of correspondence with [[Jean Beaufret]], an early French translator of Heidegger, and with Lucien Braun.

===Derrida and deconstruction===
[[Deconstruction]] came to Heidegger's attention in 1967 by way of Lucien Braun's recommendation of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s work ([[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] was present at an initial discussion and indicated to Heidegger that Derrida's work came to his attention by way of an assistant). Heidegger expressed interest in meeting Derrida personally after the latter sent him some of his work. There was discussion of a meeting in 1972, but this failed to take place.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Heidegger's interest in Derrida is said by Braun to have been considerable (as is evident in two letters, of September 29, 1967 and May 16, 1972, from Heidegger to Braun). Braun also brought to Heidegger's attention the work of [[Michel Foucault]]. Foucault's relation to Heidegger is a matter of considerable difficulty; Foucault acknowledged Heidegger as a philosopher whom he read but never wrote about. (For more on this see ''Penser à Strasbourg,'' Jacques Derrida, et al., which includes reproductions of both letters and an account by Braun, "À mi-chemin entre Heidegger et Derrida").

Derrida attempted to displace the understanding of Heidegger's work that had been prevalent in France from the period of the ban against Heidegger teaching in German universities, which amounted to an almost wholesale rejection of the influence of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and existentialist terms. In Derrida's view, deconstruction is a tradition inherited via Heidegger (the French term "déconstruction" is a term coined to translate Heidegger's use of the words "Destruktion"—literally "destruction"—and "Abbau"—more literally "de-building"). According to Derrida, Sartre's interpretation of Dasein and other key Heideggerian concerns is overly psychologistic, anthropocentric, and misses the historicality central to ''Dasein'' in ''Being and Time''.

===The Farías debate===
Jacques Derrida, [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], among others, all engaged in debate and disagreement about the relation between Heidegger's philosophy and his Nazi politics. These debates included the question of whether it was possible to do without Heidegger's philosophy, a position which Derrida in particular rejected. Forums where these debates took place include the proceedings of the first conference dedicated to Derrida's work, published as "Les Fins de l'homme à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 août 1980", Derrida's "Feu la cendre/cio' che resta del fuoco", and the studies on [[Paul Celan]] by Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida which shortly preceded the detailed studies of Heidegger's politics published in and after 1987.

When in 1987 [[Víctor Farías]] published his book ''Heidegger et le nazisme'', this debate was taken up by many others, some of whom were inclined to disparage so-called "deconstructionists" for their association with Heidegger's philosophy. Derrida and others not only continued to defend the importance of reading Heidegger, but attacked Farías on the grounds of poor scholarship and for what they saw as the sensationalism of his approach. Not all scholars agreed with this negative assessment: [[Richard Rorty]], for example, declared that "[Farías'] book includes more concrete information relevant to Heidegger's relations with the Nazis than anything else available, and it is an excellent antidote to the evasive apologetics that are still being published."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/618_reg_print.html Richard Rorty, review of ''Heidegger and Nazism'' in the New Republic, quoted on the Temple University Press promotional page for ''Heidegger and Nazism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bernard Stiegler===
More recently, Heidegger's thought has considerably influenced the work of the French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]]. This is evident even from the title of Stiegler's multi-volume ''magnum opus'', ''La technique et le temps'' (volume one translated into English as ''[[Technics and Time, 1|Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Stiegler,'' Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), part 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Stiegler offers an original reading of Heidegger, arguing that there can be no access to "originary temporality" other than via material, that is, technical, supports, and that Heidegger recognised this in the form of his account of world historicality, yet in the end suppressed that fact. Stiegler understands the existential analytic of ''Being and Time'' as an account of psychic [[individuation]], and his later "history of being" as an account of collective individuation. He understands many of the problems of Heidegger's philosophy and politics as the consequence of Heidegger's inability to integrate the two.

===Giorgio Agamben===
Heidegger has been very influential on the work of Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]. Agamben attended seminars in France led by Heidegger in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Durantaye, Leland de la. (2009). Giorgio Agamben. A Critical Introduction. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Heidegger's influence upon 20th century [[continental philosophy]] is unquestioned and has produced a variety of critical responses.

===Early criticisms===
According to Husserl, ''Being and Time'' claimed to deal with ontology but only did so in the first few pages of the book. Having nothing further to contribute to an ontology independent of human existence, Heidegger changed the topic to ''Dasein''. Whereas Heidegger argued that the question of human existence is central to the pursuit of the question of being, Husserl criticized this as reducing phenomenology to "philosophical anthropology" and offering an abstract and incorrect portrait of the human being.&lt;ref&gt;See Edmund Husserl, ''Psychological and transcendental phenomenology and the confrontation with Heidegger (1927–1931)'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neo-Kantian]] [[Ernst Cassirer]] and Heidegger engaged in an influential debate located in [[Davos]] in 1929, concerning the significance of Kantian notions of freedom and rationality (see [[Cassirer–Heidegger debate]]). Whereas Cassirer defended the role of rationality in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Heidegger argued for the priority of the imagination.

Dilthey's student [[Georg Misch]] wrote the first extended critical appropriation of Heidegger in ''Lebensphilosophie und Phänomenologie. Eine Auseinandersetzung der Diltheyschen Richtung mit Heidegger und Husserl'', Leipzig 1930 (3rd ed. Stuttgart 1964).

===Left-Hegelianism and critical theory===
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]-influenced Marxist thinkers, especially [[György Lukács]] and the [[Frankfurt School]], associated the style and content of Heidegger's thought with German irrationalism and criticized its political implications.

Initially members of the Frankfurt School were positively disposed to Heidegger, becoming more critical at the beginning of the 1930s. Heidegger's student Herbert Marcuse became associated with the Frankfurt School. Initially striving for a synthesis between Hegelian Marxism and Heidegger's phenomenology, Marcuse later rejected Heidegger's thought for its "false concreteness" and "revolutionary conservativism." [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote an extended critique of the ideological character of Heidegger's early and later use of language in the ''Jargon of Authenticity''. Contemporary social theorists associated with the Frankfurt School have remained largely critical of Heidegger's works and influence. In particular, [[Jürgen Habermas]] admonishes the influence of Heidegger on recent French philosophy in his polemic against "postmodernism" in ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' (1985). However, recent work by philosopher and critical theorist [[Nikolas Kompridis]] tries to show that Heidegger's insights into [[world disclosure]] are badly misunderstood and mishandled by Habermas, and are of vital importance for critical theory, offering an important way of [[reflective disclosure|renewing that tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'' MIT Press, 2006.{{page needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09672550500169125 |title=Disclosing Possibility: The Past and Future of Critical Theory1 |journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=325–51 |year=2005 |last1=Kompridis |first1=Nikolas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception by analytic and Anglo-American philosophy===
Criticism of Heidegger's philosophy has also come from [[analytic philosophy]], beginning with [[logical positivism]]. In "The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language" (1932), [[Rudolf Carnap]] accused Heidegger of offering an "illusory" ontology, criticizing him for committing the fallacy of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] and for wrongly dismissing the logical treatment of language which, according to Carnap, can only lead to writing "nonsensical pseudo-propositions."

The British logical positivist [[A. J. Ayer]] was strongly critical of Heidegger's philosophy. In Ayer's view, Heidegger proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence, which are completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. For Ayer, this sort of philosophy was a poisonous strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.

[[Bertrand Russell]] commented, expressing the sentiments of many mid-20th-century analytic philosophers, that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Highly eccentric in its terminology, his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''Wisdom of the West'' (New York: Crescent Books, 1989), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roger Scruton]] stated that:  "His major work ''Being and Time'' is formidably difficult—unless it is utter nonsense, in which case it is laughably easy. I am not sure how to judge it, and have read no commentator who even begins to make sense of it".&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Collins, ''Introducing Heidegger'' (Thriplow, Cambridge: Icon Books, 1998), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analytic tradition values clarity of expression. Heidegger, however, has on occasion appeared to take an opposing view, stating for example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;those in the crossing must in the end know what is mistaken by all urging for intelligibility: that every thinking of being, all philosophy, can ''never'' be confirmed by "facts," i.e., by beings. Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy. Those who idolize "facts" never notice that their idols only shine in a borrowed light. They are also meant not to notice this; for thereupon they would have to be at a loss and therefore useless. But idolizers and idols are used wherever gods are in flight and so announce ''their'' nearness.&lt;ref name="MartinHeidegger"&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)'' (Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1999), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Apart from the charge of [[obscurantism]], other analytic philosophers considered the actual content of Heidegger's work to be either faulty and meaningless, vapid or uninteresting. However, not all analytic philosophers have been as hostile. [[Gilbert Ryle]] wrote a critical yet positive review of ''Being and Time''. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] made a remark recorded by [[Friedrich Waismann]]: "To be sure, I can imagine what Heidegger means by being and anxiety"&lt;ref&gt;''Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle: Conversations Recorded by Friedrich Waismann'', Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1979, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; which has been construed by some commentators&lt;ref&gt;James Luchte, ‘Under the Aspect of Time ("sub specie temporis"): Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and the Place of the Nothing,’ Philosophy Today, Volume 53, Number 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; as sympathetic to Heidegger's philosophical approach. These positive and negative analytic evaluations have been collected in Michael Murray (ed.), ''Heidegger and Modern Philosophy: Critical Essays'' (Yale University Press, 1978). Heidegger's reputation within English-language philosophy has slightly improved in philosophical terms in some part through the efforts of [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Richard Rorty]], and a recent generation of analytically oriented phenomenology scholars. Pragmatist Rorty claimed that Heidegger's approach to philosophy in the first half of his career has much in common with that of the latter-day Ludwig Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, Rorty asserted that what Heidegger had constructed in his writings was a myth of being rather than an account of it.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Collins, ''Introducing Heidegger'' (Thriplow, Cambridge: Icon Books, 1998), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that Heidegger's writing is "notoriously difficult", possibly because his thinking was "original" and clearly on obscure and innovative topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/heidegge/#SH8a|title=Heidegger, Martin  - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary European reception===
Even though Heidegger is considered by many observers to be the most influential philosopher of the 20th century in continental philosophy, aspects of his work have been criticised by those who nevertheless acknowledge this influence, such as [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. Some questions raised about Heidegger's philosophy include the priority of ontology, the status of animals, the nature of the religious, Heidegger's supposed neglect of ethics (Levinas), the body ([[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]), sexual difference ([[Luce Irigaray]]), or space ([[Peter Sloterdijk]]).

Levinas was deeply influenced by Heidegger, and yet became one of his fiercest critics, contrasting the infinity of the good beyond being with the immanence and totality of ontology. Levinas also condemned Heidegger's involvement with National Socialism, stating: "One can forgive many Germans, but there are some Germans it is difficult to forgive. It is difficult to forgive Heidegger."&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Levinas, ''Nine Talmudic Readings'' (Indiana University Press, 1990), p. xxv, translated by Annette Aronowicz&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger's defenders, notably Arendt, see his support for Nazism as arguably a personal " 'error' " (a word which Arendt placed in quotation marks when referring to Heidegger's Nazi-era politics).&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''Martin Heidegger At 80'', New York Review of Books, 17/6, (Oct. 21, 1971), 50–54; repr. in ''Heidegger and Modern Philosophy'' ed. M. Murray  (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1978), 293–303&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders think this error was irrelevant to Heidegger's philosophy. Critics such as Levinas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11052004-163310/unrestricted/Gauthier_dis.pdf "Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and the Politics of Dwelling"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223914/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11052004-163310/unrestricted/Gauthier_dis.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }} by David J.

Richard Wolin, the author of several books on Heidegger and a close reader of the Faye book, said he is not convinced Heidegger’s thought is as thoroughly tainted by Nazism as Mr. Faye argues. Nonetheless he recognizes how far Heidegger’s ideas have spilled into the larger culture." ''An Ethical Question: Does a Nazi Deserve a Place Among Philosophers?'' by Patricia Cohen. New York Times.

==In film==
* ''Being in the World'' draws on Heidegger's work to explore what it means to be human in a technological age.  A number of Heidegger scholars are interviewed, including [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Mark Wrathall]], Albert Borgmann, John Haugeland and Taylor Carman.
* ''[[The Ister (film)|The Ister]]'' (2004) is a film based on Heidegger's [[Hölderlin's Hymn "The Ister"|1942 lecture course]] on [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], and features [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], Bernard Stiegler, and [[Hans-Jürgen Syberberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theister.com/credits.html|title=The Ister: Credits|last=|first=|date=|website=The Ister|publisher=Black Box Sound and Image|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209221829/http://www.theister.com/credits.html|archive-date=9 February 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theister.com/intro_extended.html|title=The Ister: Introduction|last=|first=|date=|website=The Ister|publisher=Black Box Sound and Image|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209221826/http://www.theister.com/intro_extended.html|archive-date=9 February 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film director [[Terrence Malick]] translated Heidegger's 1929 essay ''Vom Wesen des Grundes'' into English. It was published under the title ''The Essence of Reasons'' (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1969, bilingual edition). It is also frequently said of Malick that his cinema has Heideggerian sensibilities. See for instance: Marc Furstenau and Leslie MacAvoy, "Terrence Malick's Heideggerian Cinema: War and the Question of Being in The Thin Red Line" In ''The cinema of Terrence Malick: Poetic visions of America'', 2nd ed. Edited by Hanna Patterson (London: Wallflower Press 2007): 179–91. See also: Stanley Cavell, ''The World Viewed: Reflections on the Ontology of Film'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1979): XV.
* The 2006 experimental short ''Die Entnazifizierung des MH'' by [[James T. Hong]] imagines Heidegger's denazification proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zukunftsmusik.com/zm/mh.html|title=ZUKUNFTSMUSIK -- DIE ENTNAZIFIZIERUNG DES MH|website=www.zukunftsmusik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 2012 film ''[[Hannah Arendt (film)|Hannah Arendt]]'', Heidegger is portrayed by actor Klaus Pohl.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12899">'''Oja's learning rule''', or simply '''Oja's rule''', named after Finnish computer scientist [[Erkki Oja]], is a model of how neurons in the brain or in [[artificial neural networks]] change connection strength, or learn, over time. It is a modification of the standard Hebb's Rule (see [[Hebbian learning]]) that, through multiplicative normalization, solves all stability problems and generates an algorithm for [[principal components analysis]]. This is a computational form of an effect which is believed to happen in biological neurons.

==Theory==
Oja's rule requires a number of simplifications to derive, but in its final form it is demonstrably stable, unlike Hebb's rule. It is a single-neuron special case of the [[Generalized Hebbian Algorithm]]. However, Oja's rule can also be generalized in other ways to varying degrees of stability and success.

===Formula===
Oja's rule defines the change in presynaptic weights {{math|'''w'''}} given the output response &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of a neuron to its inputs {{math|'''x'''}} to be

:&lt;math&gt;\,\Delta \mathbf{w} ~ = ~ \mathbf{w}_{n+1}-\mathbf{w}_{n} ~ = ~ \eta \, y_{n} (\mathbf{x}_{n} - y_{n}\mathbf{w}_{n}),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''η''}} is the ''learning rate'' which can also change with time. Note that the bold symbols are [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] and {{math|''n''}} defines a discrete time iteration. The rule can also be made for continuous iterations as

:&lt;math&gt;\,\frac{d\mathbf{w}}{d t} ~ = ~ \eta \, y(t) (\mathbf{x}(t) - y(t)\mathbf{w}(t)).&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation===
The simplest learning rule known is Hebb's rule, which states in conceptual terms that ''neurons that fire together, wire together''. In component form as a difference equation, it is written

:&lt;math&gt;\,\Delta\mathbf{w} ~ = ~ \eta\, y(\mathbf{x}_n) \mathbf{x}_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, 
or in scalar form with implicit  {{math|''n''}}-dependence,
:&lt;math&gt;\,w_{i}(n+1) ~ = ~ w_{i} + \eta\, y(\mathbf{x}) x_{i}&lt;/math&gt;,

where {{math|''y''('''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is again the output, this time explicitly dependent on its input vector {{math|'''x'''}}.

Hebb's rule has synaptic weights approaching infinity with a positive learning rate. We can stop this by normalizing the weights so that each weight's magnitude is restricted between 0, corresponding to no weight, and 1, corresponding to being the only input neuron with any weight. We do this by normalizing the weight vector to be of length one:

:&lt;math&gt;\,w_i (n+1) ~ = ~ \frac{w_i + \eta\, y(\mathbf{x}) x_i}{\left(\sum_{j=1}^m [w_j + \eta\, y(\mathbf{x}) x_j]^p \right)^{1/p}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that in Oja's original paper,&lt;ref name="Oja82"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oja |first=Erkki |authorlink=Erkki Oja |date=November 1982 |title=Simplified neuron model as a principal component analyzer |journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=267–273 |id=BF00275687 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u9u6120r003825u1/ |accessdate= 2007-11-22 |quote= |doi=10.1007/BF00275687 |pmid=7153672 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|''p''{{=}}2}}, corresponding to quadrature (root sum of squares), which is the familiar [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] normalization rule. However, any type of normalization, even linear, will give the same result [[without loss of generality]].

For a small learning rate &lt;math&gt;| \eta | \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; the equation can be expanded as a [[Power series]] in &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Oja82"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\,w_i (n+1) ~ = ~ \frac{w_i}{\left( \sum_j w_j^p \right)^{1/p}} ~ + ~ \eta \left( \frac{y x_i}{\left(\sum_j w_j^p \right)^{1/p}} - \frac{w_i \sum_j y x_j w_j}{\left(\sum_j w_j^p \right)^{(1 + 1/p)}} \right) ~ + ~ O(\eta^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

For small {{math|''η''}}, our [[Big-O notation|higher-order terms]] {{math|''O''(''η''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} go to zero. We again make the specification of a linear neuron, that is, the output of the neuron is equal to the sum of the product of each input and its synaptic weight, or

:&lt;math&gt;\,y(\mathbf{x}) ~ = ~ \sum_{j=1}^m x_j w_j &lt;/math&gt;.

We also specify that our weights normalize to {{math|1}}, which will be a necessary condition for stability, so

:&lt;math&gt;\,| \mathbf{w} | ~ = ~ \left( \sum_{j=1}^m w_j^p \right)^{1/p} ~ = ~ 1&lt;/math&gt;,

which, when substituted into our expansion, gives Oja's rule, or

:&lt;math&gt;\,w_i (n+1) ~ = ~ w_i + \eta\, y(x_i - w_i y)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Stability and PCA===
In analyzing the convergence of a single neuron evolving by Oja's rule, one extracts the first ''principal component'', or feature, of a data set. Furthermore, with extensions using the [[Generalized Hebbian Algorithm]], one can create a multi-Oja neural network that can extract as many features as desired, allowing for [[principal components analysis]].

A principal component {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is extracted from a dataset {{math|'''x'''}} through some associated vector {{math|'''q'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;⋅'''x'''}}, and we can restore our original dataset by taking

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} ~ = ~ \sum_j a_j \mathbf{q}_j&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case of a single neuron trained by Oja's rule, we find the weight vector converges to {{math|'''q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or the first principal component, as time or number of iterations approaches infinity. We can also define, given a set of input vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, that its correlation matrix {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} has an associated [[eigenvector]] given by {{math|'''q'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with [[eigenvalue]] {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The [[variance]] of outputs of our Oja neuron {{math|σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') {{=}} ⟨y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')⟩}} then converges with time iterations to the principal eigenvalue, or

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sigma^2(n) ~ = ~ \lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;.

These results are derived using [[Lyapunov function]] analysis, and they show that Oja's neuron necessarily converges on strictly the first principal component if certain conditions are met in our original learning rule. Most importantly, our learning rate {{math|''η''}} is allowed to vary with time, but only such that its sum is ''divergent'' but its power sum is ''convergent'', that is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \eta(n) = \infty, ~~~ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \eta(n)^p &lt; \infty, ~~~ p &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Our output [[activation function]] {{math|''y''('''x'''(''n''))}} is also allowed to be nonlinear and nonstatic, but it must be continuously differentiable in both {{math|'''x'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} and have derivatives bounded in time.&lt;ref name="Haykin98"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haykin |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Haykin |title=Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation |edition=2 |year=1998 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= |isbn=0-13-273350-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalizations===
Recently, in the context of associative learning, it has been shown that the Hebbian rule, which is similar to Oja's rule, can be generalized using an Ising-like model:&lt;ref&gt;Jakub M. Tomczak, [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-01857-7_28 Associative learning using Ising-like model], in Advances in Systems Science, (eds.) Jerzy Świątek, Adam Grzech, Paweł Świątek, Jakub M. Tomczak, Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing, Vol. 240, Springer-Verlag, 2014, pp. 295-304, [http://www.ii.pwr.wroc.pl/~tomczak/PDF/icss2013_jt.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The main idea of the generalization is based on formulating energy function like in Ising model and then applying stochastic gradient descent algorithm to this energy function. The energy function and the update rule corresponding to following the derivative are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;E(\mathbf{w}) = - h\mathbf{w} - b \mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{V} \mathbf{w}  - c \mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x} y &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}_{n+1} = \mathbf{w}_{n} + \eta ( h + b (\mathbf{V} + \mathbf{V}^{\top}) \mathbf{w}_{n} + c \mathbf{x}_{n+1} y_{n+1} )&lt;/math&gt;,

where:
&lt;math&gt;y \in \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the coupling among inputs, &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is the correlation strength between the model and the output, &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the presence of an external magnetic field, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V} \in \{0,1\}^{D\times D}&lt;/math&gt; determines the connections among inputs.

Then, for &lt;math&gt;h=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c = 1&lt;/math&gt; we get the Hebbian rule, and for &lt;math&gt;h=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b=-0.5&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; is an identity matrix, introduce weight decay. The formula then reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}_{n+1} = \mathbf{w}_{n} + \eta (  2 b \mathbf{w}_{n} + \mathbf{x}_{n+1} y_{n+1} )&lt;/math&gt;,

==Applications==
Oja's rule was originally described in Oja's 1982 paper,&lt;ref name="Oja82"/&gt; but the principle of self-organization to which it is applied is first attributed to [[Alan Turing]] in 1952.&lt;ref name="Haykin98"/&gt; PCA has also had a long history of use before Oja's rule formalized its use in network computation in 1989. The model can thus be applied to any problem of [[self-organizing map]]ping, in particular those in which feature extraction is of primary interest. Therefore, Oja's rule has an important place in image and speech processing. It is also useful as it expands easily to higher dimensions of processing, thus being able to integrate multiple outputs quickly. A canonical example is its use in [[binocular vision]].&lt;ref name="Intrator07"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nin/Courses/NC06/Hebb_PCA.ppt |title=Unsupervised Learning |accessdate=2007-11-22 |last=Intrator |first=Nathan |year=2007 |work=Neural Computation lectures |publisher=[[Tel-Aviv University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology and Oja's subspace rule===
There is clear evidence for both [[long-term potentiation]] and [[long-term depression]] in biological neural networks, along with a normalization effect in both input weights and neuron outputs. However, while there is no direct experimental evidence yet of Oja's rule active in a biological neural network, a [[biophysics|biophysical]] derivation of a generalization of the rule is possible. Such a derivation requires retrograde signalling from the postsynaptic neuron, which is biologically plausible (see [[neural backpropagation]]), and takes the form of

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta w_{ij} ~ \propto ~ \langle x_i y_j \rangle - \epsilon \left\langle \left(c_\mathrm{pre} * \sum_k w_{ik} y_k \right) \cdot \left(c_\mathrm{post} * y_j \right) \right\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where as before {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the synaptic weight between the {{math|''i''}}th input and {{math|''j''}}th output neurons, {{math|''x''}} is the input, {{math|''y''}} is the postsynaptic output, and we define {{math|''ε''}} to be a constant analogous the learning rate, and {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;pre&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;post&lt;/sub&gt;}} are presynaptic and postsynaptic functions that model the weakening of signals over time. Note that the angle brackets denote the average and the ∗ operator is a [[convolution]]. By taking the pre- and post-synaptic functions into frequency space and combining integration terms with the convolution, we find that this gives an arbitrary-dimensional generalization of Oja's rule known as '''Oja's Subspace''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oja |first=Erkki |authorlink=Erkki Oja |year=1989 |title=Neural Networks, Principal Components, and Subspaces |journal=[[International Journal of Neural Systems]] (IJNS) |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=61–68 |doi=10.1142/S0129065789000475 |url=http://www.worldscinetarchives.com/cgi-bin/details.cgi?id=pii:S0129065789000475&amp;type=html |accessdate= 2007-11-22 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; namely

Accessed 5 July 2018. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of dementia is not the true form and does not result from the same cognitive changes. Once the depression is properly treated or the medication therapy is changed, the cognitive impairment can be effectively reversed. True dementia involves a steady and irreversible cognitive decline. In addition, diminished mental capacity and social withdrawal are commonly identified as symptoms in the elderly but oftentimes is due to symptoms of depression.&lt;ref name="Tabers"&gt;Venes, Donald. Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary.Philadelphia: F.A.

If effective medical treatment for depression is given, this can aid in the distinction between pseudodementia and dementia. Antidepressants have been found to assist in the elimination of cognitive dysfunction associated with depression, whereas cognitive dysfunction associated with true dementia continues along a steady gradient.  In cases where antidepressant therapy is not well tolerated, patients can consider electroconvulsive therapy as a possible alternative. &lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt; However, studies have revealed that patients who displayed cognitive dysfunction related to depression eventually developed dementia later on in their lives.

The development of treatments for dementia has not been as fast as those for depression. Thus far, cholinesterase inhibitors is the most popular drug used to combat dementia and provides improvement in cognitive function.&lt;ref name="Gale2"&gt;Swartout-Corbeil, Deanna M., and Rebecca J. Frey. "[http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/CX2760400298/GVRL?u=cuny_laguardia&amp;sid=GVRL&amp;xid=9b8469b6 Dementia]."

==History and controversy of term==
The term was first coined in 1961 by psychiatrist [[Leslie Gordon Kiloh|Leslie Kiloh]], who noticed patients with cognitive symptoms consistent with dementia who improved with treatment. Reversible causes of true dementia must be excluded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His term was mainly descriptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kiloh |first=Leslie Gordon |authorlink=Leslie Gordon Kiloh |year=1961 |title=Pseudodementia |journal= [[Acta Psychiatr Scand]] |volume=37 |pages=336–51 |pmid=14455934 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1961.tb07367.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical phenomenon, however, was well-known since the late 19th century as melancholic dementia.&lt;ref name=pmid3889224&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.48.5.393 |author=Berrios GE |title="Depressive pseudodementia" or "Melancholic dementia": a 19th century view |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=393–400 |date=May 1985 |pmid=3889224 |pmc=1028324 |url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3889224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doubts about the classification and features of the syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McAllister |first=TW |date=May 1983 |title=Overview: Pseudodementia |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=140 |issue=5 |pages=528–33 |pmid=6342420|doi=10.1176/ajp.140.5.528}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the misleading nature of the name, led to proposals that the term be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poon |first=Leonard W |year=1991 |title=Toward an understanding of cognitive functioning in geriatric depression |journal=International Psychogeriatrics |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=241–66 |doi=10.1017/S1041610292001297 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=272114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents argue that although it is not a defined singular concept with a precise set of symptoms, it is a practical and useful term which has held up well in clinical practice, and also highlights those who may have a treatable condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dementia: Presentations, Differential Diagnosis, and Nosology |editor1=V.

==Presentation and differential==
The history of disturbance in pseudodementia is often short and abrupt onset, while dementia is more often insidious. Clinically, people with pseudodementia differ from those with true dementia when their memory is tested. They will often answer that they don't know the answer to a question, and their attention and concentration are often intact, and they may appear upset or distressed. Those with true dementia will often give wrong answers, have poor attention and concentration, and appear indifferent or unconcerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wells |first=CE |date=May 1979 |title=Pseudodementia |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=136 |issue=7 |pages=895–900 |pmid=453349 |doi=10.1176/ajp.136.7.895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation and application of existing collaborative care models such as DICE can aid in avoiding misdiagnosis. Comorbidities (such as vascular, infectious, traumatic, autoimmune, idiopathic, or even malnourishment) have the potential to mimic symptoms of dementia.&lt;ref name="Kverno"&gt;Kverno, Karan S. and Roseann Velez. “Comorbid Dementia and Depression: The Case for Integrated Care.” Journal for Nurse Practitioners Volume 14, Issue 3, March 2018, Pages 196-201. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nurpra.2017.12.032&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, studies have also shown a relationship between depression and its cognitive effects on everyday functioning and distortions of memory. &lt;ref name="memory"&gt;Sjunaite, Karolina, Claudia Lanza, and Matthias W. Riepe. “Everyday false memories in older persons with depressive disorder.” Psychiatry Research 261 (2018): 456-463. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2018.01.030&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[SPECT]] imaging of the brain show reduced blood flow in areas of the brain in people with [[Alzheimer's disease]], compared with a more normal blood flow in those with pseudodementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Melancholia: A disorder of movement and mood: A phenomenological and neurobiological review |last=Parker |first=Gordon |authorlink= Gordon Parker (psychiatrist) |author2=Dusan Hadzi-Pavlovic |author3=Kerrie Eyers  |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-47275-X |pages=273–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public execution''' is a form of [[capital punishment]] which "members of the general public may voluntarily attend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/capital-punishment |title=Capital punishment |first=Roger |last=Hood |access-date=3 October 2018 |journal=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition excludes the presence of a small number of witnesses randomly selected to assure executive accountability.&lt;ref name=blum&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blum |first=Steven A. |date=Winter 1992 |title=Public Executions: Understand the "Cruel and Unusual Punishments" Clause |url=http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V19/I2/Blum.pdf |journal=Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly |publisher= |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=415 |doi= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326225628/http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V19/I2/Blum.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While today most countries regard public executions with distaste, in the past they were preferred to executions behind closed doors because they allowed the convicted the opportunity to make a final speech, gave the state the chance to display its power in front of those who fell under its jurisdiction, and granted the public what was considered to be a great spectacle.&lt;ref name=Cawthorne&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawthorne |first=Nigel |date=2006 |title=Public Executions: From Ancient Rome to the Present Day |url= |location= |publisher= |pages=6–7 |isbn=978-0-7858-2119-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public executions also permitted the state to project its superiority over political opponents.&lt;ref name=Cawthorne/&gt; Thus, when [[Charles I of England]] was beheaded, the reduced height of the block meant that he could not assume the normal kneeling pose, but was forced to lie in a face-down position considered to be especially humiliating.&lt;ref name=Cawthorne/&gt;

In Europe and in the northern U.S., the 19th and early 20th centuries saw a shift away from the spectacle of public capital punishment and toward administration of punishment via the deprivation of liberty.&lt;ref name=chambliss&gt;{{cite book|author=William J. Chambliss|title=Corrections|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NMF1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some reformers opposed capital punishment, public executions remained common throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=chambliss/&gt; Social historians note that beginning in the 20th century in the U.S. and western Europe death in general became increasingly shielded from public view, occurring more and more behind the closed doors of the hospital.&lt;ref name=chambliss/&gt; Executions were likewise moved behind the walls of the penitentiary.&lt;ref name=chambliss/&gt; The last formal public executions occurred in 1868 in Britain, in 1936 in the U.S. and in 1939 in France.&lt;ref name=chambliss/&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], in 2012 "public executions were known to have been carried out in [[Public executions in Iran|Iran]], [[Public executions in North Korea|North Korea]], [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] and [[Somalia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rogers |first=Simon |last2=Chalabi |first2=Mona |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/29/death-penalty-countries-world |title=Death penalty statistics, country by country |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2013-12-13 |accessdate=2015-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] does not include Syria, Afghanistan, and Yemen in their list of public execution countries, but there have been reports of public executions carried out there by state and non-state actors, such as [[ISIS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/01/08/isis-extremist-executes-his-mother-in-syria-for-urging-him-to-flee-group.html |title=ISIS extremist reportedly kills his mother in public execution in Syria |publisher=Fox News |date=2016-01-08 |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/08/world/isis-fast-facts/index.html |title=ISIS Fast Facts |author=CNN Library |date=3 September 2018 |access-date=9 October 2018 |work=[[Cable News Network]] |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=Tamara |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1197900/Justice-Yemen-style-Paedophile-raped-boy-11-shot-head-hundreds-spectators.html |title=Justice Yemen-style: Paedophile who raped boy, 11, shot in the head in front of hundreds of spectators &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-07-07 |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Updated 6:21 AM ET, Mon July 9, 2012 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/08/world/asia/afghanistan-public-execution/ |title=Video: Taliban shoot woman 9 times in public execution as men cheer |publisher=CNN |date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executions which can be classified as public were also carried out in the U.S. states of Florida and Utah as of 1992.&lt;ref name=blum/&gt;

'''Major Rawshan Yazdani Bhuiyan''' (died 1981) was a [[Bangladesh]]i freedom fighter. He was accused by [[Government of Bangladesh]] for taking part in the [[Assassination of Ziaur Rahman|assassination of president Ziaur Rahman]], and was hanged in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=106746|title=Death anniversary of 13 executed army officers observed|work=The Daily Star|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/2009/09/24/79599.html|title=Families observe death anniversary|work=The Financial Express|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Rowshan was graduated from [[Faujdarhat Cadet College]]. He wanted to be involved into farming, and so after graduation from the Faujdarhat Cadet College when most of his classmates went to military or engineering, he went to [[Bangladesh Agricultural University]], [[Mymensingh]].

== Liberation war ==
However, during the [[Bangladesh liberation war]] in 1971, he joined the liberation war and after independence, Rowshan was given a commission in the Bangladesh Army. As he had joined the army much later, he was still a Major when his college classmates were already Colonels or Brigadiers in the army.

== Role in assassination of Ziaur Rahman ==
{{Main|Assassination of Ziaur Rahman}}
Rowshan’s role in the assassination is unclear. He was not one of the members of the group who had gone to the Circuit House that night.

However, Rowshan was arrested in the remote Chittagong village, while he was with [[Abul Manzoor|General Manzoor's]] wife and family, trying to find a secure place for them. By that time, with General Manzoor's had already being killed. According to Rowshan’s close friends, “when others had conveniently left Manzoor and joined hands with then CAS [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]], Rowshan took it up on his shoulder the responsibility of saving the family of the fallen General.”

==Death==
Rowshan was found guilty by Military Tribunal.

Rowshan's closest friend in Cadet College was Brigadier General Ashraf who was then Chief of NSI and was personal secretary to the then CAS [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]]. Rowshan's another close friend Amin (CSP) was PS to the President [[Ziaur Rahman]] and was present during the killing in the same Chittagong Circuit House.

As Rowshan’s last wish, the jail authorities allowed him to send a short telegram to the person he possibly still considered his closest friend. Rowshan send a telegram to Brigadier General Ashraf which said "Save Life". Brigadier General Ashraf did confirm receiving the telegram.

Brigadier General Ashraf also confirmed that till the last moment Yazdani was fighting and tried to climb the well with his tied up legs thus prolonging his death and suffering.

'''Robert Boyd''' (1808–1883),&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Nick Hervey, 'Boyd, Robert (1808–1883)', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3114  accessed 4 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; was a physician and writer on mental illness, who, in 1870 became president of the [[Medico-Psychological Association]]&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; (now the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]]).

==Life==
Boyd became a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1830, and in the following year graduated M.D. in the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 1836 he became a licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians]], and in 1852 was elected to the fellowship of the college. For some time he was resident physician at the Marylebone workhouse infirmary, and afterwards physician and superintendent of the [[Somerset]] county lunatic asylum. He then became proprietor and manager of the Southall Park private asylum, which was destroyed in August 1883 by a fire; he lost his life after re-entering the burning building to rescue thepatients.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; 

In the various positions in which he was placed he utilised to the utmost his opportunities for original research. He was also a Fellow of the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]] and also an antiquarian.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Writings==
He published the annual ''Reports on the Pauper Lunatics'' at the St. Marylebone infirmary and the Somerset county asylum, and contributed numerous independent papers to the literature of [[pathology]] and psychological medicine. He was the author of pathological contributions to the ''Royal Medical and Chirurgical Transactions'', vols. xxiv. and xxxii., and to the ''Edinburgh Medical Journal'', vols. lv. to lxxii.; of ''Tables of the Weights of the Human Body and Internal Organs'', in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]''; and of a paper, ''The Weight of the Brain at different Ages and in various Diseases''. 

He contributed no fewer than sixteen papers to the ''Journal of Mental Science'' on "Treatment of the Insane Poor", "Diseases of the Nervous System", "Statistics of Pauper Insanity", and cognate subjects, the most important being that on "[[General paresis of the insane|General Paralysis of the Insane]]" in the ''Journal of Mental Science'' for May and October 1871, the result of 155 [[post-mortem]] examinations of persons who had died from that disease in the Somerset county asylum. He was also the author of three papers on "[[vital signs|vital statistics]]", "[[Insanity]]", and "The Pauper Lunacy Laws", published in ''[[The Lancet]]''.

'''SS ''Creekirk''''' was a cargo [[steamship]] that was built in [[Scotland]] in 1912 and sunk with all hands by a German submarine in 1940. At her launch in 1912 she was named '''SS ''Mariston'''''. In her 28-year career she was renamed '''SS ''Milcovul''''' in 1913, '''SS ''Hyphaestos''''' in 1933 and SS ''Creekirk'' in 1938.&lt;ref name=LR38/&gt;

==Building and first owner==
Robert Duncan and Company of [[Port Glasgow]] built the ship for W.S. Miller's Ellaston Steam Ship Company&lt;ref name=Mariners&gt;

==Changes of owner and name==
In 1913 ''Mariston''{{'}}s owners sold her to Romania Prima Naţională de Navigație Maritimă,&lt;ref name=Mariners/&gt; who renamed her ''Milcovul'' and registered her in [[Port of Brăila|Brăila]]&lt;ref name=LR30/&gt; on the River [[Danube]]. In August 1916 Romania entered the First World War, and by the end of the year ''Milcovul'' had been requisitioned as a transport ship for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]].&lt;ref name=Mariners/&gt; In 1918 [[German Empire]] forces captured her but that November the [[Central Powers]] [[Armistice with Germany|conceded defeat]] to the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] and ''Milcovul''{{'}}s owners recovered her.&lt;ref name=Mariners/&gt;

''Milcovul'' was in Romania Prima Naţională de Navigație Maritimă's fleet for two decades. When the Russian émigré Alexandre Vlasov took over the company in 1933, ''Milcovul'' was sold to Ant. G. Yannoulatos and Sons, who renamed her ''Hyphaestos'' and registered her in [[Port of Piraeus|Piraeus]].&lt;ref name=LR35/&gt; Yannoulatos ran ''Hyphaestos'' for five years and then sold her in 1938 to the Cree Steam Ship Company Ltd of London.&lt;ref name=LR38/&gt; Cree renamed the ship ''Creekirk'', registered her in [[Port of London|London]] and appointed Muir, Young Ltd to manage her.&lt;ref name=LR38/&gt;

==Convoy SC-7 and loss==
In autumn 1940 ''Creekirk'' loaded 5,900 tons of iron ore at [[Wabana, Newfoundland and Labrador|Wabana]] and [[Conception Bay]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and then sailed to [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=U609/&gt; There she joined [[Convoy SC-7]], which on 5 October sailed for [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool]]. ''Creekirk'' was typical of SC 7's 35 merchant ships: old, slow (one source says she could manage only {{convert|8.5|kn|km/h}})&lt;ref&gt;

''Creekirk'' had only one [[Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships|DEMS]] professional military gunner:&lt;ref name=U609/&gt; her armament would have been operated largely by members of her own [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] crew. At first the convoy had but one escort ship, the {{sclass-|Hastings|sloop}} {{HMS|Scarborough|L25|6}}.

On 16 October a [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf pack]] of [[U-boat]]s found SC 7 and quickly overwhelmed its inadequate defences. The attack continued for several days, and on 18 October it intensified as the number of U-boats increased. At 2112 hrs ''Creekirk'' was in the [[Western Approaches]] northwest of [[Rockall]] when [[Fritz Frauenheim]]'s {{GS|U-101|1940|2}} torpedoed her.&lt;ref name=U609/&gt; She sank quickly with the loss of all hands: her [[Sea captain|Master]] Elie Robilliard, 34 crew and her one DEMS gunner.&lt;ref name=U609/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10415">'''Selective reduction''' is the practice of reducing the number of [[fetus]]es in a [[multiple pregnancy]], say [[quadruplets]], to a [[twin]] or singleton pregnancy. The procedure is also called '''multifetal reduction'''.&lt;ref name=ACOG2017&gt;{{cite web |title=Opinion Number 719: Multifetal Pregnancy Reduction |url=https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Ethics/Multifetal-Pregnancy-Reduction |publisher=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ Committee on Ethics. |date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The procedure is most commonly done to reduce the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy to a safe number, when the multiple pregnancy is the result of use of [[assisted reproductive technology]]; outcomes for both the mother and the babies are generally worse, the higher the number of fetuses.&lt;ref name=Legendre2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2013.02.004 |pmid=23518032 |title=Differences between selective termination of pregnancy and fetal reduction in multiple pregnancy: A narrative review |journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=542–54 |year=2013 |last1=Legendre |first1=Claire-Marie |last2=Moutel |first2=Grégoire |last3=Drouin |first3=Régen |last4=Favre |first4=Romain |last5=Bouffard |first5=Chantal }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure is also used in multiple pregnancies when one of the fetuses has a serious and incurable disease, or in the case where one of the fetuses is [[ectopic pregnancy|outside the uterus]], in which case it is called '''selective termination'''.&lt;ref name=Legendre2013/&gt;

The procedure generally takes two days; the first day for testing in order to select which fetuses to reduce, and the second day for the procedure itself, in which [[potassium chloride]] is injected into the heart of each selected fetus under the guidance of ultrasound imaging.&lt;ref name=Evans2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=MI |last2=Andriole |first2=S |last3=Britt |first3=DW |title=Fetal reduction: 25 years' experience. |journal=Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy |date=2014 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=69–82 |doi=10.1159/000357974 |pmid=24525884}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Risks of the procedure include bleeding requiring transfusion, rupture of the uterus, [[retained placenta]], infection, a miscarriage, and [[prelabor rupture of membranes]]. Each of these appears to be rare.&lt;ref name=Legendre2013/&gt;

Selective reduction was developed in the mid-1980s, as people in the field of assisted reproductive technology became aware of the risks that multiple pregnancies carried for the mother and for the fetuses.&lt;ref name=WaPO&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mundy |first1=Liza |title=Too Much to Carry? |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/15/AR2007051501730_pf.html |work=Washington Post Magazine |date=May 20, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405010648/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/15/AR2007051501730_pf.html |archivedate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=The Two-Minus-One Pregnancy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/magazine/the-two-minus-one-pregnancy.html|publisher=New York Times Magazine|first=Ruth|last=Padawer|date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use==
Selective reduction is used when a mother is carrying an unsafe or undesirable number of fetuses in a [[multiple pregnancy]], which are common in [[assisted reproductive technology|medically-assisted pregnancies]], in order to reduce the number of fetuses to a number that is relatively safe for the mother and the remaining fetuses.&lt;ref name=ACOG2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zipori2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zipori |first1=Y |last2=Haas |first2=J |last3=Berger |first3=H |last4=Barzilay |first4=E |title=Multifetal pregnancy reduction of triplets to twins compared with non-reduced triplets: a meta-analysis. |journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online |date=September 2017 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=296–304 |doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2017.05.012 |pmid=28625760}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans2014/&gt; It is also used in cases of multiple pregnancy where at least one of the fetuses is [[ectopic pregnancy|implanted outside the uterus]] to preserve the life of the mother and the fetus in the uterus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yeh |first1=J |last2=Aziz |first2=N |last3=Chueh |first3=J |title=Nonsurgical management of heterotopic abdominal pregnancy. |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |date=February 2013 |volume=121 |issue=2 Pt 2 Suppl 1 |pages=489–95 |doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182736b09 |pmid=23344419|doi-broken-date=2018-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and when one or more of the fetuses has a serious and incurable disease.&lt;ref name=Legendre2013/&gt;

While the data is weak, due to the small sizes of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials, as of 2017 it appeared that when short term perinatal outcomes in multiple pregnancies reduced to twins are compared to those of non-reduced triplets, there were fewer deaths among the reduced babies, the twins were born later and were less likely to be [[Preterm birth|premature]], and had higher birthweight.&lt;ref name=Zipori2017/&gt; As of 2017 longterm outcomes were not well understood.&lt;ref name=Zipori2017/&gt; A 2015 Cochrane review found no randomized clinical trials to evaluate.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dodd|first1=JM|last2=Dowswell|first2=T|last3=Crowther|first3=CA|title=Reduction of the number of fetuses for women with a multiple pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=4 November 2015|volume=11|issue=11|pages=CD003932|pmid=26544079|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003932.pub3}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally selective reduction reduces the risk of preterm birth, leading to better outcomes for both mothers and the newborns.&lt;ref name=Obican2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Običan |first1=S |last2=Brock |first2=C |last3=Berkowitz |first3=R |last4=Wapner |first4=RJ |title=Multifetal Pregnancy Reduction. |journal=Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology |date=September 2015 |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=574–84 |doi=10.1097/GRF.0000000000000119 |pmid=26083128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outcomes===
Generally selective reduction reduces the risk of preterm birth, leading to better outcomes for both mothers and the newborns.&lt;ref name=Obican2015/&gt;

It appears that reduction of triplets, where each triplet is in its own placenta, to twins results in a lower risk of preterm birth and does not increase the risk of miscarriage. In triplets where two of the fetuses share a placenta and each has its own amniotic sac, it appears, with less certainty, that there is also a lower risk of preterm birth and no increase in the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anthoulakis |first1=C |last2=Dagklis |first2=T |last3=Mamopoulos |first3=A |last4=Athanasiadis |first4=A |title=Risks of miscarriage or preterm delivery in trichorionic and dichorionic triplet pregnancies with embryo reduction versus expectant management: a systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=Human Reproduction (Oxford, England) |date=1 June 2017 |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=1351–1359 |doi=10.1093/humrep/dex084 |pmid=28444191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse effects==
Risks of the procedure include bleeding requiring transfusion, rupture of the uterus, [[retained placenta]], infection, a miscarriage, and [[prelabor rupture of membranes]]. Each of these appears to be rare.&lt;ref name=Legendre2013/&gt;

==Procedure==
The reduction procedure is generally carried out during the first trimester of pregnancy.  The procedure often takes two days; the first day is for testing, and the procedure happens on the second day. The fetuses are evaluated, first by [[Abdominal ultrasonography|ultrasound]], then often by [[amniocentesis|testing the amniotic fluid]] and [[chorionic villus sampling]]; these tests help determine which fetuses are accessible for the procedure, and whether any fetuses are unhealthy. Once the specific fetuses to be reduced are identified, [[potassium chloride]] is injected into the heart of each selected fetus under the guidance of ultrasound imaging; the heart stops and the fetus dies as a result. Generally, the fetal material is reabsorbed into the woman's body.&lt;ref name=Evans2014/&gt;

==History==
Selective reduction was developed in the mid-1980s, as people in the field of [[assisted reproductive technology]] became aware of the risks that multiple pregnancies carried for the mother and for the fetuses.&lt;ref name=WaPO/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  The procedure was somewhat controversial from the beginning, and drew some attention from anti-abortion activists.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; 

A set of ethical guidelines was developed in collaboration with a bioethicist from NIH and was published in 1988; it justified reducing pregnancies with more than three fetuses to two or three.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=MI |last2=Fletcher |first2=JC |last3=Zador |first3=IE |last4=Newton |first4=BW |last5=Quigg |first5=MH |last6=Struyk |first6=CD |title=Selective first-trimester termination in octuplet and quadruplet pregnancies: clinical and ethical issues. |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |date=March 1988 |volume=71 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=289–96 |pmid=3347412 |url=https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/1988/03000/Selective_First_Trimester_Termination_in_Octuplet.1.aspx}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, more and more women sought to become pregnant when they were older, having the first child when they were over forty years old. At the same time, the field of ART matured, and massively multiple pregnancies became more rare. Both trends led to more women asking for reduction to one fetus, which was very controversial at first, but has gradually become more accepted.  [[Sex-selective abortion|Sex-selective reduction]] is widely considered to be unethical in making decisions about which fetus to keep.&lt;ref name=ACOG2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

The '''Shanti Sena''' or "Peace army" was made up of [[Gandhi]]'s [[non-violence|non-violent]] followers in India.&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;Thomas Weber: Gandhi's Peace Army: The Shanti Sena and Unarmed Peacekeeping, Syracuse Univ Pr.1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Other movements have developed, inspired by this one, sometimes also using the name used by Gandhi's group.&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt; These may include [[World Peace Brigade]], [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]], [[Swaraj Peeth]], the organisation [[Peace Brigades International]] and participants in the [[Rainbow Gathering]], and have served as a basis for the practice of [[Third Party Non-violent Intervention]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

"Shanti Sena" is a term first coined by Gandhi when he conceptualized a nonviolent volunteer peacekeeping program dedicated to minimizing communal violence within the Indian populace. The words "Shanti" and "Sena" both come from [[Sanskrit]]. Shanti means peace and Sena means army, or a drilled band of men. The word "Sena" has been criticized for its connection to militarism, but for Gandhi, it had strong metaphorical and spiritual qualities connected to its use in the Hindu [[vedas]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

In the aftermath of the Gandhian era, Shanti Sena has appeared in various incarnations. Two Gandhian followers developed separate groups based on their interpretations of it: [[Vinoba Bhave]] established a Shanti Sena that prioritized Gandhi's spiritual approach towards the program, while JP established a program that focused more on the political motivations of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weber: The Shanti Sena: Philosophy, History and Action, Orient Blackswan, New Delhi 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Shanti Sena program also became institutionalized into India's [[Gandhigram Rural University]], where it was incorporated into the university's constitution. Currently Shanti Sena is also very active in Sri Lanka as a part of the organization [[Sarvodaya]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

'''Slim Smith''' (born Keith Smith; 1948 in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] &amp;ndash; 1973) was a [[ska]], [[rocksteady]] and [[reggae]] singer. In their book ''Reggae: The Rough Guide'' (1997), Steve Barrow and Peter Dalton described Smith as "the greatest vocalist to emerge in the rocksteady era".&lt;ref name="Barrow"&gt;Barrow, Steve &amp; Dalton, Peter: "Reggae: The Rough Guide", 1997, Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-85828-247-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Smith first came to prominence as a member of the Victors Youth Band, who were highly praised at the 1964 Jamaican Festival.&lt;ref name="Larkin"&gt;{{cite book | last=Larkin | first=Colin | title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae| year=1998 | publisher=Virgin Books | isbn=0-7535-0242-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became a founding member and lead vocalist of [[The Techniques]], who recorded primarily with [[Duke Reid]] for his Treasure Isle label. In 1964 they recorded several songs for [[Byron Lee]], two of which, "Don't Do It" and "No One", were included on the LP ''The Real Jamaica Ska'' released by Epic Records and co-produced by [[Curtis Mayfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bradley | first=Lloyd | title=This Is Reggae Music:The Story Of Jamaica's Music | publisher=Grove Press | year=2001 | page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Techniques disbanded in 1965, he formed [[The Uniques (Jamaican group)|The Uniques]], who released a handful of singles including the R&amp;B influenced "Do Me Good" released on [[Ken Lack]]'s Caltone records in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Pete Holdsworth, Article on Caltone's Jamaican 45's 1966-69, published with CD, Pressure Sounds, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Slim Smith commenced recording for [[Prince Buster]] and [[Coxsone Dodd]]'s [[Studio One (record label)|Studio One]] label, the main rival to Duke Reid. His Studio One recordings brilliantly highlight his passionate, soulful voice, which had an almost manic edge, and confirm him as one of Jamaica's greatest singers. His hits from this period include "The New Boss", "Hip Hug" and "Rougher Yet", many of which were later compiled for the album ''Born To Love''. In 1967 he formed a new version of The Uniques, and commenced his association with producer [[Bunny Lee]]. They topped the Jamaican hit parade with "Let Me Go Girl", but after recording one album, ''Absolutely The Uniques'', Smith left the group, staying with Lee to concentrate on a solo career.

He had a hit almost immediately with "Everybody Needs Love". An album of the same name quickly followed, as did many further hits. By 1972 personal problems led to him being detained at Bellevue sanatorium.&lt;ref name="Observer1"&gt;"[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Slim-Smith--the-influential-singer_12307436 Slim Smith, the influential singer: Unsung]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 17 August 2012, retrieved 1 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith died in 1973. Unable to gain entry to his parents' house, he broke a window, badly lacerating his arm. He bled to death before he could receive treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressure.co.uk/item/PS21/ The Pressure Sounds Website | The Uniques — Watch This Sound]&lt;/ref&gt; His death stunned Jamaica. Still widely regarded as one of Jamaica's great vocalists, his enduring popularity has resulted in the reissue of the bulk of his work.

'''Stephen Boyd''' (4 July 1931&amp;nbsp;– 2 June 1977) was a [[Northern Irish]] actor.

He received his second  [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for ''[[Billy Rose's Jumbo]]'' (1962).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Stephen Boyd – real name William Millar – was born in a house, long demolished, at the corner of the Doagh Road, Whitehouse on July 4, 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daggy.name/cop/bkofdead/99999989.htm Profile], daggy.name/cop/bkofdead; accessed 28 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd was the youngest of nine siblings born to Irish/Canadian parents, James Alexander Millar and his wife Martha Boyd. At a very early age, William, or Billy as he was known, moved with the family to live in Glengormley. Boyd attended the local Public Elementary School and [[Ballyclare High School]], but at the age of fourteen Boyd quit school to take up other jobs to help support his family. He eventually joined the Ulster Group Theater where he learned the behind the scenes tasks of the theater. He became well known in Belfast for his contributions as a gravel-voiced policeman on the Ulster Radio program "The McCooeys", the story of a Belfast family written by Joseph Tomelty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Journal News - White Plains New York, 09 Jul 1969''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsletter.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/blue-plaque-honour-for-ulster-born-hollywood-star-stephen-boyd-1-8552887|title=Blue plaque honour for Ulster-born Hollywood star Stephen Boyd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd eventually worked his way up to character parts and then starring roles. By nineteen he had toured Canada with summer stock companies. In 1950 he made a coast to coast tour of America with the [[Clare Tree Major]] Company,&lt;ref&gt;''Stephen Boyd, The Man Who Never Wants to Pour Another Coffee, by John Neal''&lt;/ref&gt; 1956 performing ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' &lt;ref&gt;''Daily News, NY, NY May 5, 1963''&lt;/ref&gt; in the lead role as [[Stanley Kowalski]]. Boyd would later recall this as "the best performance I ever gave in my life." &lt;ref&gt;''Movieland Magazine interview December of 1962''&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time he was twenty, Boyd had a wide range of theater experience, but he longed for the big stage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Movie Screen'' Stephen Boyd Interview, June 1960&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 Boyd moved to London and worked in a cafeteria and busked outside a cinema in Leicester Square to get money as he was literally close to starvation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Boyd caught his first break as a doorman at the Odeon Theatre. The Leicester Square Cinema across the street recruited him to usher attendees during the British Academy Awards in the early 1950s. During the awards ceremony he was noticed by actor Sir [[Michael Redgrave]], who used his connections to introduce Boyd to the director of the Windsor Repertory Group.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At this point Boyd's stage career in the U.K. began to flourish with performances in "The Deep Blue Sea" and "Barnett's Folly" &lt;ref&gt;Movieland" Magazine, Dec 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early roles===
Boyd's first role which brought him acclaim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19560405&amp;id=X7cxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dOQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7080,904122&amp;hl=en |title=Irish-Canadian Film Actor Gains Stardom in Big Part |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen |page=28 |date=5 April 1956 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was as an Irish spy in the movie ''[[The Man Who Never Was]]'', based on the book by [[Ewen Montagu]]. The movie was released in April 1956.

Shortly thereafter he signed a ten-year contract with [[20th Century Fox]] studios,&lt;ref&gt;''Hedda Hopper, Los Angeles Times, May 29, 1956''&lt;/ref&gt; who began prepping him for Hollywood. But it would be a while until Boyd actually set foot on a Hollywood back-lot. Boyd's next stop was Portugal to make ''[[A Hill in Korea|Hell in Korea]]'', which also featured future stars [[Michael Caine]] and [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Caine, "What's it all About?, page 114-115''&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1956, Boyd was cast in the nautical, ship-wreck adventure ''[[Seven Waves Away|Abandon Ship!]]'' for Columbia Studios starring [[Tyrone Power]]. This was filmed in the summer of 1956 in London where the British Navy  built a huge 35,000 gallon water tank for the movie.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Louis Dispatch July 14, 1956''&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1956, for Twentieth Century Fox, Boyd traveled to the [[British West Indies]] as part of a large ensemble cast in [[Darryl Zanuck]]'s racially provocative film ''[[Island in the Sun (film)|Island in the Sun]]'', based on the [[Alec Waugh]] novel.&lt;ref&gt;''The Corpus Christi Caller, Nov 27, 1956''&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd portrayed a young English aristocrat who becomes the lover of [[Joan Collins]]. Boyd would be loaned out to the [[J. Arthur Rank]] production of ''[[Seven Thunders (film)|Seven Thunders]] (Beast of Marseilles)'', a [[World War II]] romance set in Nazi-occupied Marseilles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Los Angeles Times, March 23, 1957''&lt;/ref&gt; This movie was filmed on location in [[Marseilles]] and at [[Pinewood Studios]] in London in the spring of 1957 &lt;ref&gt;''https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050174/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt''&lt;/ref&gt;  and featured Boyd in his most prominent starring film role yet.

Around the same time French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] was given the opportunity to cast her own leading man in her next movie after her success in [[Roger Vadim]]'s ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]'', and she chose Boyd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19580504&amp;id=g3dWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8eQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3095,1129485&amp;hl=en |last=Lambert |first=John |title=Bardot Picks a Co-Star |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=4 May 1958 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From August to October 1957,&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Inquirer August 29, 1957''&lt;/ref&gt; Bardot, Boyd and [[Alida Valli]] filmed the lusty romance ''[[The Night Heaven Fell]]'', directed by [[Roger Vadim]] in Paris and in the region of [[Málaga]], [[Spain]], specifically the small, white-washed town of Mijas.&lt;ref&gt;''Ottawa Citizen Feb 15, 1958''&lt;/ref&gt; Being in the Bardot spotlight added much to Boyd's film credit, in addition to bringing him notice in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;The Salt Lake Tribune, 24 June 1958,  ''Ireland's Boyd- A Man Apart&amp;nbsp;— And all Because of Bardot''&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Boyd finally arrived in Hollywood in January 1958 to take on his first true Hollywood role as the leader of a quartet of renegade outlaws in the Twentieth Century Fox western ''[[The Bravados]]'', which starred [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Joan Collins]]. Even though this was a Hollywood production, the actual filming took place in [[Morelia]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;''Lee Belser, Lubbock Evening Journal, February 28, 1958''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ben-Hur''===
After the filming of ''[[The Bravados]]'' was complete in late March 1958, Stephen Boyd returned to Hollywood to audition for the coveted role of Messala in [[MGM]]'s upcoming epic ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''. Many other actors, including [[Victor Mature]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Leslie Nielsen]] and [[Stewart Granger]] had been considered for the part,&lt;ref&gt;''The Los Angeles Times, April 17, 1958''&lt;/ref&gt; but Stephen Boyd's screen test convinced director [[William Wyler]] that he had found the perfect villain for his epic, as Wyler had also admired Boyd's performance in ''[[The Man Who Never Was]]'' the previous year. Boyd was hurried off to join actor [[Charlton Heston]] in Rome in May 1958 to learn the chariot racing aspect of his role. Heston had already been practicing behind the chariot for weeks, so Boyd needed to learn quickly. Boyd was also required to wear brown contact lenses as Messala, which irritated his eyes and caused vision problems for a few months after the movie was completed. Despite this, Boyd described the filming experience of ''Ben-Hur'' (which took place in [[Cinecittà]] Studios in Rome), as the most exciting experience of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19581204&amp;id=zjkxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5wAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7405,6177173&amp;hl=en |title=Stephen Boyd Endures Agony for Art's Sake |last=Heffernan |first=Harold |newspaper=Toledo Blade |date=4 December 1958 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years after the movie was released, interim ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' screenwriter and novelist [[Gore Vidal]] revealed that Boyd had portrayed his famous character [[Messala (Ben-Hur)|Messala]] in ''Ben-Hur'' with an underlying homosexual energy, as instructed to by [[Gore Vidal]] when he greets Ben-Hur [[Charlton Heston]] in the opening sequence. In Gore Vidal's autobiography "Palimpsest,"&lt;ref name="Gore Vidal pages 303"&gt;''Palimpsest by Gore Vidal, pages 303 to 307, published in 1996''&lt;/ref&gt; Vidal describes his discussion first with director [[William Wyler]], concerning Messala's underlying motivation, namely that Messala and Judah Ben-Hur had previously been lovers.  This was based on an idea by Vidal to enhance the tension between the two main antagonists. Wyler specifically told Vidal, "You talk to Boyd. But don't ''you'' say a word to Chuck or he'll fall apart." &lt;ref&gt;(Palimpsest, by Gore Vidal, Page 306)&lt;/ref&gt; In "Palimpsest", Vidal said, "Over the next few years, whenever we met (William Wyler), we quarreled amiably over what I had put in the scene and what Steven Boyd is clearly playing."  Vidal would later come into conflict with actor [[Charlton Heston]] about his version of the Messala/Ben-Hur relationship and the implications surrounding [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]].&lt;ref name="Gore Vidal pages 303"/&gt;

After the filming of ''Ben-Hur'' was completed Boyd returned to Hollywood in early 1959 to star with [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner [[Susan Hayward]] in the Canadian-based drama ''[[Woman Obsessed]]''. Some advertisements for this movie labeled Boyd as "The New Gable."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19580812&amp;id=TAUkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4QAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7250,1107861&amp;hl=en ''Toledo Blade''] 12 August 1958&lt;/ref&gt;  He was then part of another excellent ensemble cast in the adaptation of [[Rona Jaffe]]'s novel ''[[The Best of Everything (film)|The Best of Everything]]'', filmed in May and June 1959 at Fox Studios in Hollywood and on location in New York City.

''Ben-Hur'' was released in December 1959 and immediately made Boyd an international star. His portrayal of the Roman tribune Messala brought in rave reviews. Press columnist Erskine Johnson wrote, "A brass hat and the armor of a Roman warrior in ''Ben-Hur'' does for Stephen Boyd what a tight dress does for Marilyn Monroe."&lt;ref&gt;''The Odessa American'', 19 December 1959, "Actor Stephen Boyd Really Packs Wallop"&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Waterbury, in her Boyd feature in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, would describe Boyd's character as "the dangerously masculine and quite magnificent Messala."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19610715&amp;id=P8daAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NmwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4358,3443168&amp;hl=en |title=Boydie |last=Waterbury |first=Ruth |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=15 July 1961 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern Screen'' magazine in 1960 stated that Boyd's  ruthless Messala had "lost the chariot race but captured the sympathy and sex appeal of ''Ben-Hur''."&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Screen'', Stephen Boyd "Introducing the Sensational Star of Ben Hur and Best of Everything", October–December 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
Boyd was featured in the popular TV program ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' on 3 February 1960, which featured many of Boyd's family members and acquaintances (including Michael Redgrave) telling stories about his early life and film career. This should be some indication of how "Stephen Boyd fever" was catching. Newspaper columnists were getting swarmed with letters from female fans of all ages wanting to know more about Boyd.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19600309&amp;id=sQcvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bE4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7562,2549137&amp;hl=en "Maids, Matrons Here Cheering For Stephen Boyd"] ''Pittsburgh Press'' 9 March 1960&lt;/ref&gt; He was being sent dozens of starring roles, most of which he had to turn down due to other obligations. He opted out of the biblical epic ''[[The Story of Ruth]]'', which didn't please Fox studios, and he was one of the front-runners to star with [[Marilyn Monroe]] in her picture ''Let's Make Love''.&lt;ref&gt;''The News Review'' 24 March 1960, "Oscar Ground Rules Hazy For Supporting Actor Roles"&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1960 Boyd won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture]] for his performance in ''Ben-Hur''.&lt;ref name="IMDb profile"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000963/bio IMDb profile], imdb.com; accessed 28 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1960 Boyd made a guest appearance alongside the silent-era ''Ben-Hur'' stars [[Ramon Novarro]] and [[Francis X. Bushman]] on [[Hedda Hopper]]'s special television programme ''Hedda Hopper's Hollywood''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19600108&amp;id=Q3hhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3wQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6554,1304721&amp;hl=en "Hedda Hopper's Show on Sunday"] ''Ocala Star Banner'', 8 January 1960&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1960 he starred in the [[Playhouse 90]] television performance called ''The Sound of Trumpets'' with [[Dolores Hart]], which garnered good reviews. He also appeared as a singing guest on [[The Dinah Shore Chevy Show]] on March 13, 1960 where he performed two Irish folk songs with Dinah Shore, "The Leprechaun Song" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/irish-songs-ballads-lyrics/leprechaun_song.htm|title=Irish Music, Song and Ballad Lyrics for: Leprechaun Song|website=www.traditionalmusic.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Molly Malone", and an Irish step dance.&lt;ref&gt;(Arizona Republic, 13 March 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5d2sdr_dinah-shore-03-13-1960-stephen-boyd-shelley-berman_tv|title=Dinah Shore (03_13_1960) - STEPHEN BOYD, SHELLEY BERMAN - Video Dailymotion|date=24 February 2017|website=Dailymotion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd himself chose to do roles which he felt comfortable in. His next choice was ''[[The Big Gamble (1961 film)|The Big Gamble]]'', which featured [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]'s current paramour and French icon [[Juliette Gréco]]. It was filmed on the [[Ivory Coast]] of [[West Africa]], [[Dublin]] and the southern part of France in the spring and summer of 1961. The adventure of making this film almost outdid the adventure in the film itself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19600801&amp;id=YvkjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4QQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1488,3307578&amp;hl=en |title=Trout Fly With Sequins- That's French Fishing Flair |work=Ocala Star-Banner |page=5 |date=1 August 1960 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19601002&amp;id=sOhHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LoAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3018,3351049&amp;hl=en |title=Africa's Most Rabid Film Fans |last=Bacon |first=James |work=[[The Victoria Advocate]] |agency=Associated Press |location=London |page=11 |date=2 October 1960 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the crew slept in tents in the jungle that were guarded by natives on parole for cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19600925&amp;id=iokeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rswEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2690,3861205&amp;hl=en |title=She Slept with the Cannibals |newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal |page=5C |date=25 September 1960 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyd nearly drowned in the Ardèche river during the making of the film. Luckily he was saved by his co-star and excellent swimmer [[David Wayne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19600705&amp;id=Zl4xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eg8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2640,2510221&amp;hl=en |title=Wayne Saves Drowning Actor |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |date=5 July 1960 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd spoke about this incident during his appearance on the popular TV programme ''[[What's My Line?]]'' which aired on 11 December 1960.

Boyd was originally chosen to play [[Mark Antony]] opposite [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in 20th Century Fox's epic production of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' ([[1963 in film|1963]]) under the direction of [[Rouben Mamoulian]]. He began film work in September 1960 but eventually withdrew from the problem-plagued production after Elizabeth Taylor's severe illness postponed the film for months. (''Cleopatra'' was later directed by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], and the role of Mark Antony went to [[Richard Burton]].)&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0000963}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of waiting in April 1961 Stephen Boyd was sent to [[Cairo]], Egypt on a publicity tour by [[Twentieth Century Fox]] along with fellow actors [[Julie Newmar]] and [[Barbara Eden]] to attend the inaugural ceremony of the sound and light show at the pyramids of [[Giza]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Los Angeles Times,  13 Apr 1961, Thu,  Page 86''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Daily Tribune May 11, 1961''&lt;/ref&gt;

After several months without active work, Boyd was thrilled to finally get his first post-Cleopatra role.&lt;ref&gt;(The Bridgeport Post, July 11, 1961, "Stephen Boyd Ends Big Wait")&lt;/ref&gt; The film was ''[[The Inspector (1962 film)|The Inspector]]'', renamed ''Lisa'' for the American release. It was based on the novel by [[Jan de Hartog]] and co- starred actress [[Dolores Hart]]. The film was made in [[Amsterdam]] , London and Wales during the summer of 1961. On January 9, 1962, Boyd was featured in a television film from [[General Electric Theater]] called ''The Wall Between'', co-starring [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Gloria Talbott]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Herald, Provo Utah, 08 January 1962''&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, Boyd was again loaned out to MGM Studios to star with [[Doris Day]] in the circus musical ''[[Billy Rose's Jumbo]]'', filmed during the early part of 1962; the role earned Boyd a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].

Boyd flew to Rome in the summer of 1962 to act with Italian superstar [[Gina Lollobrigida]] in her long-time pet project ''[[Imperial Venus (film)|Imperial Venus]]'', a romantic epic about the many loves of [[Pauline Bonaparte]], the sister of [[Napoleon]]. This film was the first film to be banned by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] for male nudity. Boyd appeared in a humorous bedroom scene, naked, but covered by a sheet.&lt;ref&gt;''Ottawa Citizen'', 10 July 1964, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19640710&amp;id=Gr0yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Fe0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1232,2402566&amp;hl=en "Nude Movie Scenes…How about Lassie?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion of nudity was too much for the censors and the movie was never released in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19841204&amp;id=qNUvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CKYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6488,4632441&amp;hl=en |title=Names Etcetera |newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]] |agency=Knight-Ridder |page=30 |date=4 December 1984 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyd returned to the States briefly after finishing [[Imperial Venus]] where he appeared for the second time on [[The Dinah Shore Chevy Show]], which aired on November 11, 1962. For thus program Boyd was a last minute replacement for actor [[James Garner]] and joined Shore and entertainer [[Dean Martin]] for a few musical numbers.&lt;ref&gt;''Argus Leader (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), November 10, 1962''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Herald (Port Huron, Michigan), November 10, 1962.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd arrived in Spain in early 1963 to begin work on [[Samuel Bronston]]'s massive production of the''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', directed by [[Anthony Mann]]. This was filmed during a severely cold winter in Europe and the production in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] of Spain encountered several challenges with the snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19630205&amp;id=p7gqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pGUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7159,1061883&amp;hl=en |title=Some Portuguese See Their First Snow |agency=Associated Press |location=London |newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |page=10 |date=5 February 1963 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Rome in Madrid" (1964 Making of The Fall of the Roman Empire film), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnWkzdajxwQ''&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd's co-star was another Italian legend, Sophia Loren. Boyd also had the opportunity to ride another chariot in this film. Although the movie did well internationally when it was released in April 1964, it was a box office failure in the United States and signaled the end of Roman epics in the 1960s. More appreciated with the passing of time, ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' was also recognized by critics as being a major inspiration for Ridley Scott's [[Academy Award]] winning movie ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]].''

Boyd flew back to Hollywood in the summer to star in a [[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]] TV Program with [[Louis Jourdan]] called ''War of Nerves'', which aired on January 3, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjq2oXMBTpc|title=The Chrysler Theater: "War of Nerves" (1964)|first=|last=GR160289|date=10 July 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to Europe to film the suspenseful ''[[The Third Secret (film)]]'' starring  [[Pamela Franklin]] and [[Diane Cilento]].

On December 23, 1963, Stephen Boyd became a naturalized U.S. citizen during a ceremony at the Federal Building in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, Dec 25, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Boyd was originally cast as the lead in Anthony Mann's WWII drama "''The Unknown Battle''", which was set to film in early 1964 with co-stars [[Elke Sommer]] and [[Anthony Perkins]] in Norway. &lt;ref&gt;The Los Angeles Times, Jan 24, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;The Progress Index, Feb 24, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; After several weeks of waiting, studio funding for the project fell though.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury Park Press, July 2, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd sued Mann for $500,000 for a breach of contract, missed time and other lost film opportunities. &lt;ref&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer, April 25, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The project was finally completed by Mann a year later and released as ''[[Heroes of Telemark]]'' with [[Kirk Douglas]] replacing Boyd as the lead.  &lt;ref&gt;Looking at Hollywood: Steve Boyd Is Back After Stint Abroad Hopper, Hedda.

In 1964 Boyd continued to make films in Europe, traveling to [[Yugoslavia]] to star as the villain Jamuga in the epic ''[[Genghis Khan (1965 film)|Genghis Khan]]''. Boyd was the top billed and therefore the top paid star in the epic, and this apparently caused friction with up-and-coming star [[Omar Sharif]].&lt;ref&gt;''Miami News'' 25 June 1965, "More Dramatics than Spectacle in Genghis Khan"&lt;/ref&gt; After completing ''Genghis Khan'', Boyd trekked to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] for a brief appearance as the regal King [[Nimrod]] at [[The Tower of Babel]] in [[Dino de Laurentiis]]'s production of ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...|The Bible]]'', directed by [[John Huston]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 29 December 1964, "Steve Boyd Is Back After Stint Abroad"&lt;/ref&gt; 

After all this globe-trotting, the world weary Boyd was very happy to return to the United States to start work on the Twentieth Century Fox science fiction adventure ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'', co-starring with soon-to-be icon [[Raquel Welch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1774&amp;dat=19650318&amp;id=3uQhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oWUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2656,4646021&amp;hl=en |title=Movie Actor Seeks Hollywood Home |agency=UPI |location=Hollywood |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=18 March 1965 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was filmed in the early part of 1965. In the summer of 1965, Boyd joined German star [[Elke Sommer]] and music legend [[Tony Bennett]] to film the Hollywood drama ''[[The Oscar (film)|The Oscar]]'', based on the eponymous [[Richard Sale (director)|Richard Sale]] novel. The movie was a popular success, but maligned by film critics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Times News'', Burlington North Carolina, 1 August 1966, "Movie Argument Continues"&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd would make a 10-day visit to [[Iran]] in December 1965 to film his scenes for the [[United Nations]] film project ''[[The Poppy Is Also a Flower]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(Hedda Hopper, Chicago Tribune, December 31, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[James Bond]] creator [[Ian Fleming]].

In 1966 the producer of ''[[The Oscar (film)|The Oscar]]'', [[Joseph E. Levine|Joseph Levine]], hired Boyd for his next film project, ''[[The Caper of the Golden Bulls]]'', based on a [[William McGivern]] novel. This movie was partly filmed on location in Spain in the summer of 1966. The actors, including Boyd, took part in the famous Feria del Toro de San Fermin festival in [[Pamplona]] (known as the Running of the Bulls).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19660711&amp;id=4TQgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I1AEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6420,3584537&amp;hl=en |title=Sheilah Graham |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Press]] |page=23 |date=11 July 1966 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of Boyd's projects were ranked among the top twenty-five grossing films of 1966; ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...|The Bible]]'' at number one and  ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' at twenty-two.

Next, Boyd starred in a spy thriller ''[[Assignment K]]'' with Swedish model/actress [[Camilla Sparv]], which was filmed in Germany, Austria and London during February and March 1967.&lt;ref&gt;(The Los Angeles Times, January 10, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd grew a full beard &lt;ref&gt;(Arizona Republic June 12, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; for his next role as the iconic Irish playwright and critic [[George Bernard Shaw]] in the [[Off-Broadway]] play called ''The Bashful Genius'' written by Harold Callen. This was Boyd's first return to the stage since the mid-1950s, and the experience for Boyd was immensely rewarding on a personal level.&lt;ref&gt;(The Philadelphia Inquirer, July 30, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; He received excellent reviews for his nuanced performance of the multi-faceted Shaw.&lt;ref&gt;(The Philadelphia Enquirer, August 1, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;  The play had a very brief run during the summer of 1967 in Denver, Philadelphia and Falmouth, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;(News Journal Wilmington Delaware, September 9, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North Adams Transcript Massachusetts, August 25, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1968 Boyd was cast as the heavy opposite [[Sean Connery]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in the western adventure ''[[Shalako (film)|''Shalako'' (film)]]'', based on the [[Louis L'Amour]] novel.&lt;ref&gt;(Abilene Reporter-News Abilene, Texas Sun, May 26, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shalako'' was filmed in the early part of 1968 in [[Almería]], Spain. After returning to the United States, Boyd took the role of the cruel slave master Nathan MacKay in the Southern "Slavesploitation" drama ''[[Slaves (film)|Slaves]]'', also starring [[Ossie Davis]] and songstress [[Dionne Warwick]]. The film was loosely based on the famous [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. It was filmed during the summer of 1968 at the supposedly haunted Buena Vista plantation near Shreveport, Louisiana .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19680905&amp;id=6qUtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5J8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2688,534779&amp;hl=en |title=Film being made about slavery |work=[[Montreal Gazette]] |page=8 |date=5 September 1968 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hauntla.com/buenavista.html|title=The Buena Vista Plantation|website=www.hauntla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released during the volatile civil rights era and in May 1969 Boyd attended the premiere alongside Dionne Warwick in Baltimore, Maryland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2205&amp;dat=19690510&amp;id=CO9fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HwMGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1448,3593309&amp;hl=en |title=Opening Night |newspaper=[[Baltimore Afro-American]] |page=17 |date=10 May 1969 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely following ''Slaves'', Boyd starred in another story about racial tension, this time a World War II made-for-television drama called ''Carter's Army'' (or ''Black Brigade'') which aired in August 1970, featuring a young [[Richard Pryor]].

It was around this time that Boyd began his interest in [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s Church of [[Scientology]], which would make him one of the first Hollywood stars to be involved in it.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientology Auditor Magazine, 1968 article, https://mikemcclaughry.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/blast-from-the-past-ben-hur-actor-stephen-boyd-featured-in-scientology-auditor-mag-1968/"&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyd had always expressed an interest in esoteric religions.&lt;ref name=Loner&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19660906&amp;id=tMwwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-QUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3955,901669&amp;hl=en "Stephen Boyd; Loner Who Is Never Alone"] ''Ocala Star Banner'', 6 September 1966&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in August 1969 with the Detroit Free Press, Boyd explained that Scientology had helped him through the filming of ''Slaves'', and that to him Scientology was "a process used to make you capable of learning. Scientology is nothing. It means only what you want it to. It is not a church you go to pray, but a church that you go to learn. It is no good unless you apply it. It is the application."&lt;ref&gt;''Detroit Free Press'', 1 August 1969, "Screen Star Stephen Boyd, Since that Chariot Race"&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyd apparently had been elevated to a Scientology Status of OC 6, a position beneath that of [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]. Boyd would actually go on to star and narrate a Scientology recruiting film called ''Freedom'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;"Snapping America's Epidemic of Sudden Personality Change by Flo Conway, page 145 '...&amp;nbsp;it turned out to be a Scientology meeting. We heard a lecture and saw the introductory film, which was narrated by Stephen Boyd, the film star. It started out in a planetarium and he was standing there as if Scientology had found the stars or something.&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of this film can be found at the Library of Congress, but it is not available online via any Scientology resource,&lt;ref&gt;https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchArg=l+ron+hubbard+film+freedom&amp;searchCode=GKEY^*&amp;searchType=0&amp;recCount=25&amp;sk=en_US&lt;/ref&gt; which may indicate a falling out Boyd had with Scientology using his name for recruiting purposes. There is no documentation of his later involvement with Scientology after the early 1970s.

===1970s===
During the 1970s the demand for Boyd in Hollywood diminished, so he focused his attention on European films and several television pilots and shows.&lt;ref&gt;"Stephen Boyd Likes U.S. Best" Associated Press, March 1, 1973 Bob Thomas interview with Stephen Boyd&lt;/ref&gt; He made three films in Spain with director [[José Antonio Nieves Conde]], including ''[[Marta (film)|Marta]]'' in 1970, ''[[The Great Swindle]]'' in 1971, and ''Casa Manchada'' in 1975. He worked with cult director [[Romain Gary]] in the drug thriller ''[[Kill!]]'' in 1971. He also made several Westerns, including ''[[Hannie Caulder]]'' with Raquel Welch in 1971, ''[[The Man Called Noon]]'' in 1973, ''[[Those Dirty Dogs]]'' in 1973, and ''Potato Fritz'' in 1976. Boyd continued to travel to a wide variety of locations to work, including Australia for ''[[The Hands of Cormac Joyce]]'' in 1972, South Africa for ''Control Factor'' and ''The Manipulator'' in 1972-1973, Jamaica for the scuba diving adventure ''[[The Treasure of Jamaica Reef]]'' in 1972, Florida for the television pilot ''[[Key West]]'' in 1973, and Hawaii in his last acting stint as a guest star on the popular television show ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' in 1977. The episode ''Up the Rebels'' was the premiere episode of ''Hawaii Five-O''&amp;apos;s tenth season, and it aired after Boyd's death on 15 September 1977. His most critically acclaimed role during the 1970s was as a colourful Irish gangster in the UK crime thriller ''[[The Squeeze (1977 film)|The Squeeze]]'' in 1977.

A letter from film producer Euan Lloyd (who produced such films as ''Shalako'', ''The Man Called Noon'' and ''The Wild Geese''), states that "Stephen Boyd was one of the nicest, kindest people I have met in my lifetime, rare in this profession."&lt;ref&gt;Cushnan, Joe [https://archive.is/20140629144624/http://www.feedaread.com/books/Stephen-Boyd-From-Belfast-To-Hollywood-9781782990864.aspx ''Stephen Boyd: From Belfast To Hollywood''] {{ISBN|9781782990864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Boyd spent most of his adult life traveling abroad for film work, he made his permanent home in southern California. At one point in the 1960s, he had three homes there — one above the Sunset Strip, one in Tarzana and another in Palm Springs, where he enjoyed his favorite pastime, golf.&lt;ref name=Loner/&gt; He would make frequent trips back to his hometown of Belfast in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Reporter'', Dover, OH, 23 March 1968&lt;/ref&gt; to visit his family. On one particular visit to Belfast in 1971, Boyd exclaimed his dismay about the situation in Northern Ireland at that time: "Because of the divisiveness, the potential for displaying to the world all that is good in that lovely land is lost, perhaps even destroyed." Boyd was valued so highly by his native city of Belfast that during his visits he was always given a military escort from the airport to his home for security reasons during [[The Troubles]].&lt;ref name="Tower Ticker"&gt;Wiedrich, Bob. ''Chicago Tribune'' "Tower Ticker", 5 November 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and commemoration==
Boyd died suddenly of a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 2 June 1977 at the age of 45 while playing golf with his wife Elizabeth Mills at the Porter Valley Country Club in [[Northridge, Los Angeles|Northridge, California]]. "Stephen and Elizabeth were in a golf cart between the fifth and sixth tees when suddenly he said. 'I don't feel well. I don't think we should go on' and slumped over. Elizabeth dragged him out of the cart and gave him artificial respiration, but it was too late." &lt;ref&gt;''Detroit Free Press June 9, 1977''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was in talks to play the role of the [[Regimental sergeant major|Regimental Sergeant Major]] in [[Euan Lloyd]]'s ''[[The Wild Geese]]'' before his death.&lt;ref name="euanlloyd"&gt;Euan Lloyd interview, ''Cinema Retro'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd was cremated and his ashes were interred in [[Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth, California]]. His wife Elizabeth Mills Boyd was interred with him at the time of her death in 2007. Boyd is also remembered on his parents' grave in the Clandeboye Cemetery, Bangor, U.K.&lt;ref name="newsletter.co.uk"/&gt;

On July 4, 2018, the Ulster History Circle, a voluntary organization which erects plaques across the province of Ulster to celebrate people of achievement, commemorated Stephen Boyd with a [[Blue plaque#Northern Ireland|blue plaque]] close to his birthplace at 'Moygara', Shore Road, Whitehouse (Belfast, Northern Ireland).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44701189
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
''Silver Screen'' Magazine in 1960 wrote this about Boyd:

{{quote|A supreme individualist, like most Irishman, he has a wonderful actor's face that easily switches from an engaging smile to sinister menace. Far handsomer in person than on the screen&amp;nbsp;... Stephen Boyd is a lean (180 pounds), well built (six-foot-one) charmer of 31, with a dazzling dimple, light brown curly hair, fair skin and the kind of grey eyes which take on color from what he is wearing. A man of tremendous vitality, moody and volatile, a typical Celt, he veers from humor to anger in the wink of an eye. He dresses conservatively; speaks wittily, and extremely well, though he confesses that he's had almost no formal schooling; is genial and friendly ('I have my brooding hours which wipe that grin off my face').&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Screen'' Magazine, June 1960; "Stephen Boyd - Sex Appeal + Blarney" by Maxine Block&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Journalist [[Florabel Muir]] described Boyd's appeal in a feature from 1966. "I would think it has to be his ruggedly masculine good looks. Strong, even craggy features, a wide sympathetic mouth, firm chin, athletic build, wavy dark brown hair, roving 185-lb. frame – all that plus a musical voice and the savoir faire of a much-traveled fellow – his films have taken him to many places in the world, and a rolling stone acquires a high polish." &lt;ref&gt;Florabel Muir, Valley Morning Star, September 18, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Personally, Boyd was popular with Hollywood columnists, including his friend [[Hedda Hopper]], as well as fellow actors and other members of the entertainment industry because of his charm and sense of humor. "Boyd is the kind of a man who was born to make friends and he has been doing it most of his life...Boyd is a blue-eyed, curly-haired chunk of masculinity, who makes no attempt to hide the fact that he just plain likes people. On the set of "Ben-Hur" he rarely occupied the fancy portable dressing room set aside for his use. Instead, he spent his time between scenes sitting around and chatting with electricians, carpenters and his fellow actors. He will discuss any subject and enjoys a good argument. He can, like most Irishmen, sprinkle his talk with wit as well as sagacity." &lt;ref&gt;"The Evening Standard", Stephen Boyd Prefers Villain Role in 'Ben-Hur' Pennsylvania, October 14, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd was first married in 1958 to Italian-born MCA executive Mariella Di Sarzana during the filming of ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''. They separated after just three weeks. Concerning his short-lived marriage to Sarzana, Boyd would explain, "It was my fault. I'm an Irish so-and-so when I'm working. I hadn't been married a week when we both knew we had made a mistake. She is a nice girl but we were just not meant for each other. I suppose I wasn't ready for marriage. Maybe I was still too much of an adolescent." &lt;ref&gt;''Screen Album'', August–October 1960, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; They officially divorced in early 1959.&lt;ref&gt;''The Free Lance-Star'' 20 December 1958, "The Divorce Set"&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd lived as a bachelor for most of his life and was wary of marriage after his first experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19600428&amp;id=hQswAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_QAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5317,6024126&amp;hl=en "Stephen Boyd Serious In Romantic Ventures"] ''Toledo Blade'', 28 April 1960&lt;/ref&gt; His secretary Elizabeth Mills was a permanent resident at his Tarzana home during these years, though the two did not marry until 1974.&lt;ref&gt;''Movie Life Jan 1963'', article, "Let me tell you about Steve Boyd (his very best friend reveals all" and  The Courier Journal (Louisville Kentucky), Dec 30 1962, "Stephen Boyd is Glad he Escaped Cleopatra with Liz Taylor" : Excerpt, "There's an English girl who looks after his house in the Valley here, but marriage does not seem to be on their agenda."&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd had a deep and lasting friendship with actress and French icon [[Brigitte Bardot]]. Boyd starred in two movies with Bardot&amp;nbsp;— ''[[The Night Heaven Fell]]'' in 1958 and ''[[Shalako]]'' in 1968. During the filming of ''[[Shalako]]'' in Almeria, Spain, Bardot and Boyd's close relationship and open affection for each other sparked numerous rumors of a possible affair.&lt;ref name="Photoplay Film 1968"&gt;''Photoplay Film'', September 1968, "Boyd and Bardot- the Truth Behind Those Rumors"&lt;/ref&gt; It even caused Brigitte's husband at the time, [[Gunter Sachs]], to ask for a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;''The Milwaukee Journal'', 8 March 1968&lt;/ref&gt; In Bardot's autobiography, she described the events and states that Boyd "was never her lover, but a tender and attentive friend."&lt;ref&gt;"Stephen n'ayant jamais été mon amant, mais uniquement un ami tendre et attentionné!" Bardot, Brigitte. ''Initials B.B.'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''Photoplay Film'' in 1968, Boyd said, "Bardot is always Bardot. She's marvelous. She's an enormous star and she's a unique, marvelous woman. I adore her." &lt;ref name="Photoplay Film 1968"/&gt; Even though both actors denied the affair, the press was "convinced there was a romance afoot, that Brigitte and Boyd openly displayed their affection for each other, but that publication of the report on their romance cooled it." &lt;ref&gt;"Boyd on Bardot", Photolay Film Monthly, September 1968, Raymond Palmer Interviews Stephen Boyd&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dolores Hart en Stephen Boyd (1961).jpg|thumb|Hart and Boyd in 1961]]
Boyd also had a close relationship with actress [[Dolores Hart]]. Hart describes what would be her only romance with a co-star in her autobiography ''The Ear of the Heart''.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Dolores. ''The Ear of the Heart'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd eventually rejected her advances, but they remained close friends even after she turned to the cloistered life of a nun in 1963. He visited her in 1966 at the Abbey of Regina Laudis in Connecticut and remained in communication with her up until the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19660207&amp;id=N3ZQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rRAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4614,1215354&amp;hl=en "Stephen Boyd to Visit Dolores Hart, now Nun"] ''Milwaukee Sentinel'', 7 February 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Boyd's most passionate affair seems to have been with beautiful Austrian actress [[Marisa Mell]].&lt;ref&gt;http://marisa-mell.blogspot.com/2008/09/marta-or-dopo-di-che-uccide-il-maschio.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They met while filming the movie ''[[Marta (film)|Marta]]'' in 1970. Boyd initially dodged Marisa Mell's amorous advances, but during the second film they made together, ''[[The Great Swindle]]'', the two became inseparable lovers.&lt;ref name="Mell, Marisa. Coverlove, 1990"&gt;Mell, Marisa. ''Coverlove'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Schneider, Andre. ''Die Feuerblume: Über Marisa Mell und ihre Filme'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They married in a gypsy camp on the outskirts of  [[Madrid]] in late 1971. The ceremony included a wrist cutting exchange of blood to seal their bond.&lt;ref&gt;''The Record Argus'', 26 October 1971, "Boyd's Bride will be Blood Brother"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The marriage was not considered legal, but Marisa Mell said, "Who cares? In our minds it will be real."&lt;ref&gt;''The San Bernardino County Sun'', 10 November 1971&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marisa Mell, their affair was so intense that while living in Rome they made a trip to the Italian town of Sarsina for a ritual exorcism at the Cathedral of St. Vicinius.&lt;ref name="Mell, Marisa. Coverlove, 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Boyd abruptly broke off the affair after the intensity apparently became too much to bear.&lt;ref name="Mell, Marisa. Coverlove, 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In early 1972, after Boyd's departure, Mell had this to say about the break-up of their relationship: "We both believe in reincarnation, and we realized we've already been lovers in three different lifetimes, and in each one I made him suffer terribly."&lt;ref&gt;''The Akron Beacon Journal, June 16, 1972''&lt;/ref&gt; For her part, Mell would fondly remember Boyd many years later in her autobiography 'Cover Love' from 1990, dedicating a whole chapter to their affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marisa-mell.blogspot.com/search/label/Stephen%2BBoyd.|title=MARISA MELL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd's last marriage took place in 1974 to Elizabeth Mills,&lt;ref&gt;''Detroit Free Press June 9, 1977 'Just a few of the late Stephen Boyd's closest friends knew that three years ago in London he married Elizabeth Mills, whom he had been going with for many years''&lt;/ref&gt; a secretary at the British Arts Council, whom he had known since 1953. Elizabeth Mills followed Boyd to the United States in the late 1950s and was his personal assistant, friend and confidante for many years before marrying him in the mid- 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutstephenboyd.com/biography.htm Stephen Boyd infosite]; accessed 28 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16836">'''Synthetic biological circuits''' are an application of [[synthetic biology]] where biological parts inside a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] are designed to perform logical functions mimicking those observed in [[electronic circuit]]s. The applications range from simply inducing production to adding a measurable element, like [[Green Fluorescent Protein|GFP]], to an existing [[Gene regulatory network|natural biological circuit]], to implementing completely new systems of many parts.&lt;ref name="Kobayashi"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobayashi | first1 = H. | last2 = Kærn | first2 = M. | last3 = Araki | first3 = M. | last4 = Chung | first4 = K. | last5 = Gardner | first5 = T.

[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]].]]
The goal of synthetic biology is to generate an array of tunable and characterized parts, or modules, with which any desirable synthetic biological circuit can be easily designed and implemented.&lt;ref name="SynBioFaq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Synthetic Biology: FAQ|url=http://syntheticbiology.org/FAQ.html|work=SyntheticBiology.org|accessdate=21 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021212065409/http://syntheticbiology.org/faq.html|archivedate=12 December 2002|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These circuits can serve as a method to modify cellular functions, create cellular responses to environmental conditions, or influence cellular development. By implementing rational, controllable logic elements in cellular systems, researchers can use living systems as engineered "[[biological machine]]s" to perform a vast range of useful functions.&lt;ref name="Kobayashi"/&gt;

==History==
The first natural gene circuit studied in detail was the [[lac operon]]. In studies of [[diauxie|diauxic growth]] of ''[[E. coli]]'' on two-sugar media, [[Jacques Monod]] and [[Francois Jacob]]  discovered that ''E.coli'' preferentially consumes the more easily processed [[glucose]] before switching to [[lactose]] metabolism. They discovered that the mechanism that controlled the metabolic "switching" function was a two-part control mechanism on the lac operon. When lactose is present in the cell the [[enzyme]] [[β-galactosidase]] is produced to convert lactose into [[glucose]] or [[galactose]]. When lactose is absent in the cell the lac repressor inhibits the production of the enzyme β-galactosidase to prevent any inefficient processes within the cell.

The lac operon is used in the [[biotechnology]] industry for production of [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[proteins]] for therapeutic use.  The gene or genes for producing an [[exogenous]] protein are placed on a [[plasmid]] under the control of the lac promoter. Initially the cells are grown in a medium that does not contain lactose or other sugars, so the new genes are not expressed.  Once the cells reach a certain point in their growth, [[IPTG|Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)]] is added. IPTG, a molecule similar to lactose, but with a sulfur bond that is not hydrolyzable so that E. Coli does not digest it, is used to activate or "[[Regulation of gene expression#Inducible vs. repressible systems|induce]]" the production of the new protein.  Once the cells are induced, it is difficult to remove IPTG from the cells and therefore it is difficult to stop expression.

An early example of a synthetic biological circuit was published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 2000 by Tim Gardner, Charles Cantor, and [[James Collins (bioengineer)|Jim Collins]] working at [[Boston University]].  They were able to create a "bistable" switch in E. Coli.  The switch is turned on by heating the culture of bacteria and turned off by addition of IPTG.  They used GFP as a reporter for their system.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;Gardner, T.s., Cantor, C.R., Collins, J. Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli. ''Nature'' 403, 339-342 (20 January 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, synthetic circuits are a burgeoning area of research in [[systems biology]] with more publications detailing synthetic biological circuits published every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Purnick | first1 = Priscilla E. M. | last2 = Weis | first2 = Ron | year = 2009 | title = The second wave of synthetic biology: from modules to systems | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 410–422 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2698 | pmid=19461664}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been significant interest in encouraging education and outreach as well: the International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition&lt;ref&gt;International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGem) http://igem.org/Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt; manages the creation and standardization of [[BioBrick]] parts as a means to allow undergraduate and high school students to design their own synthetic biological circuits.

== Interest and goals ==
Both immediate and long term applications exist for the use of synthetic biological circuits, including different applications for [[metabolic engineering]], and [[synthetic biology]]. Those demonstrated successfully include pharmaceutical production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ro | first1 = D.-K. | last2 = Paradise | first2 = E.M. | last3 = Ouellet | first3 = M. | last4 = Fisher | first4 = K.J. | last5 = Newman | first5 = K.L. | last6 = Ndungu | first6 = J.M. | last7 = Ho | first7 = K.A. | last8 = Eachus | first8 = R.A. | last9 = Ham | first9 = T.S. | last10 = Kirby | first10 = J. | last11 = Chang | first11 = M.C.Y. | last12 = Withers | first12 = S.T. | last13 = Shiba | first13 = Y. | last14 = Sarpong | first14 = R. | last15 = Keasling | first15 = J.D. | year = 2006 | title = Production of the antimalarial drug precursor artemisinic acid in engineered yeast | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 440 | issue = | pages = 940–943 | doi=10.1038/nature04640 | pmid=16612385}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fuel production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fortman | first1 = J.L. | last2 = Chhabra | first2 = S. | last3 = Mukhopadhyay | first3 = A. | last4 = Chou | first4 = H. | last5 = Lee | first5 = T.S. | last6 = Steen | first6 = E. | last7 = Keasling | first7 = J.D. | year = 2008 | title = Biofuel alternatives to ethanol: pumping the microbial well | url = | journal = Trends Biotechnol | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 375–381 | doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2008.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However methods involving direct genetic introduction are not inherently effective without invoking the basic principles of synthetic cellular circuits. For example, each of these successful systems employs a method to introduce all-or-none induction or expression. This is a biological circuit where a simple [[repressor]] or [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]] is introduced to facilitate creation of the product, or inhibition of a competing pathway. However, with the limited understanding of cellular networks and natural circuitry, implementation of more robust schemes with more precise control and feedback is hindered. Therein lies the immediate interest in synthetic cellular circuits.

Development in understanding cellular circuitry can lead to exciting new modifications, such as cells which can respond to environmental stimuli. For example, cells could be developed that signal toxic surroundings and react by activating pathways used to degrade the perceived toxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keasling | first1 = J.D. | year = 2008 | title = Synthetic biology for [[synthetic chemistry]]. | url = | journal = ACS Chem Biol | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 64–76 | doi=10.1021/cb7002434}}&lt;/ref&gt; To develop such a cell, it is necessary to create a complex synthetic cellular circuit which can respond appropriately to a given stimulus.

Given synthetic cellular circuits represent a form of control for cellular activities, it can be reasoned that with complete understanding of cellular pathways, "plug and play"&lt;ref name="Kobayashi" /&gt; cells with well defined genetic circuitry can be engineered. It is widely believed that if a proper toolbox of parts is generated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lucks | first1 = Julius B | last2 = Qi | first2 = Lei | last3 = Whitaker | first3 = Weston R | last4 = Arkin | first4 = Adam P | year = 2008 | title = Toward scalable parts families for predictable design of biological circuits | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 567–573 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2008.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; synthetic cells can be developed implementing only the pathways necessary for cell survival reproduction. From this cell, to be thought of as a minimal [[genome]] cell, one can add pieces from the toolbox to create a well defined pathway with appropriate synthetic circuitry for an effective feedback system. Because of the basic ground up construction method, and the proposed database of mapped circuitry pieces, techniques mirroring those used to model computer or electronic circuits can be used to redesign cells and model cells for easy troubleshooting and predictive behavior and yields.

All promoters shown are inducible, activated by the displayed gene product. Each signal activates expression of a separate gene (shown in light blue). The expressed proteins then can either form a complete complex in [[cytosol]], that is capable of activating expression of the output (shown), or can act separately to induce expression, such as separately removing an inhibiting protein and inducing activation of the uninhibited promoter.]]

[[File:SynBioCirc-OrLogicGate.jpg|frame|c|center|x|The logical [[OR gate]].&lt;ref name="rocha" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buchler" /&gt; If Signal A '''OR''' Signal B are present, then the desired gene product will result. All promoters shown are inducible. Either signal is capable of activating the expression of the output gene product, and only the action of a single promoter is required for gene expression. Post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms can prevent the presence of both inputs producing a compounded high output, such as implementing a low binding affinity [[ribosome binding site]].]]

[[File:SynBioCirc-NandLogicGate.jpg|frame|c|center|x|The logical [[Negated AND gate]].&lt;ref name="rocha" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buchler" /&gt;  If Signal A '''AND''' Signal B are present, then the desired gene product will '''NOT''' result. All promoters shown are inducible. The activating promoter for the output gene is constitutive, and thus not shown. The constitutive promoter for the output gene keeps it "on" and is only deactivated when (similar to the AND gate) a complex as a result of two input signal gene products blocks the expression of the output gene.]]

===Engineered systems===
Engineered systems are the result of implementation of combinations of different logical control mechanisms. Gardner et al. used a cascading response of multiple control units to create an implementation of a toggle switch capable of controlling metabolism by a stepwise function.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; Elowitz et al. and Fung et al. created oscillatory circuits that use multiple self-regulating mechanisms to create a time-dependent oscillation of gene product expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elowitz | first1 = M.B. | last2 = Leibler | first2 = S. | year = 2000 | title = A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators | pmid = 10659856| journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = | pages = 335–338 | doi=10.1038/35002125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fung | first1 = E. | last2 = Wong | first2 = W.W. | last3 = Suen | first3 = J.K. | last4 = Bulter | first4 = T. | last5 = Lee | first5 = S. | last6 = Liao | first6 = J.C. | year = 2005 | title = A synthetic gene–metabolic oscillator | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = | pages = 118–122 | doi=10.1038/nature03508}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limited counting mechanism was implemented by a pulse-controlled gene cascade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friedland | first1 = A.E. | last2 = Lu | first2 = T.K | last3 = Wang | first3 = X. | last4 = Shi | first4 = D. | last5 = Church | first5 = G. | last6 = Collins | first6 = J.J. | year = 2009 | title = Synthetic Gene Networks That Count | url = | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5931| pages = 1199–1202 | doi=10.1126/science.1172005 | pmid=19478183 | pmc=2690711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and application of logic elements enables genetic "programming" of cells as in the research of Tabor et al., which synthesized a photosensitive bacterial edge detection program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tabor | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Salis | first2 = H.M. | last3 = Simpson | first3 = Z.B. | last4 = Chevalier | first4 = A.A. | last5 = Levskaya | first5 = A. | last6 = Marcotte | first6 = E.M. | last7 = Voigt | first7 = C.A. | last8 = Ellington | first8 = A.D. | year = 2009 | title = A Synthetic Edge Detection Program | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 137 | issue = | pages = 1272–1281 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circuit design ==
Recent developments in [[artificial gene synthesis]] and the corresponding increase in competition within the industry have led to a significant drop in price and wait time of gene synthesis and helped improve methods used in circuit design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthetic Biology: An Emerging Engineering Discipline|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150118|journal = Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering|date = 2012-01-01|pmid = 22577777|pages = 155–178|volume = 14|issue = 1|doi = 10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150118|first = Allen A.|last = Cheng|first2 = Timothy K.|last2 = Lu}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment, circuit design is improving at a slow pace because of insufficient organization of known multiple gene interactions and mathematical models. This issue is being addressed by applying computer-aided design (CAD) software to provide multimedia representations of circuits through images, text and programming language applied to biological circuits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Genetic Design Automation: Engineering Fantasy or Scientific Renewal?|last = Lux|first = Matthew W.|date = February 2012|journal = Trends in Biotechnology|doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2011.01.001|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Bramlett|first2 = Brian W.|last3 = Ball|first3 = David A.|last4 = Peccoud|first4 = Jean|pages = 120–126|volume = 30|pmc = 3073767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more well known CAD programs include GenoCAD, Clotho framework and j5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GenoCAD: CAD Software for Synthetic Biology|url = http://www.genocad.com/|website = www.genocad.com|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Clotho|url = https://www.clothocad.org/#!/|website = www.clothocad.org|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = J5|url = https://j5.jbei.org/index.php/Main_Page|website = j5.jbei.org|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; GenoCAD uses grammars, which are either opensource or user generated "rules" which include the available genes and known gene interactions for cloning organisms.

'''Tich Gwilym''' (10 September 1950 – 19 June 2005), born '''Robert Gwilliam''', was a Welsh rock guitarist who was most notable for his [[Jimmy Hendrix|Hendrix]] inspired version of the Welsh national anthem, ''[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=John |author2=Jenkins, Nigel  |title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press|page=364 |location=Cardiff |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered one of the most famous renditions of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtj.org.uk/index.php?id=5182&amp;L=0&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=103 |title=The first known recording of Hen Wlad fy Nhadau|accessdate=22 July 2012|publisher=gtj.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
Tich was born in [[Llwynypia]], in the [[Rhondda Valley]] on 10 September 1950. One of Tich's earliest bands was Kimla Taz, who he played with during the late 1960s. Although the band never gained any mainstream success, they were popular in South Wales and in 1969 played at the Croeso '69 Blues Festival at [[Abergavenny]], alongside the likes of [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/croeso-festival-1969.html Croeso Festival 1969] ukrockfestivals.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Tich found fame in the 1970s, when as part of [[Geraint Jarman|Geraint Jarman a'r Cynganeddwyr]], he recorded the Welsh national anthem on the electric guitar. The Jimi Hendrix inspired version, which first appeared on Jarman's 1978 album also called ''Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau'',&lt;ref name="Did Hendrix"/&gt; became synonymous with Tich and has appeared on compilation albums of Welsh artists. In 2006, an eight track recording of the Welsh national anthem was 'discovered' in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/lost_jimi_hendrix_song_found.html | title='Lost' Jimi Hendrix Song Found | work=ultimate-guitar.com | author= | date=1 April 2007 | accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was alleged that this was a lost version by Hendrix, though others claimed that it was a rendition by Tich.&lt;ref name="Did Hendrix"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6234341.stm | title=Did Hendrix record Welsh anthem? | work=BBC | author= | date=5 January 2007 | accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When approached, ex-band member Gerarint Jarman dismissed both claims, stating that 'It's definitely not Tich because his style was more like Hendrix's than the actual tape'.&lt;ref name="Did Hendrix"/&gt; It was later discovered that the version was a hoax, perpetrated by record producer Martin Davies and ex-guitarist of [[The Vibrators]], [[John Ellis (guitarist)|John Ellis]].&lt;ref name ="BBC Wales"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/halloffame/showbiz/titch_gwilym.shtml | title=Tich Gwilym: Acclaimed Welsh rock guitarist | work=BBC Wales | author= | accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Tich formed the Superclarkes with [[Burke Shelley]] of Welsh band [[Budgie (band)|Budgie]]. Burke played guitar and Peter Morgan played bass in the Superclarkes. The band lasted until 1993 when Morgan moved to the USA. In the 1990s Tich also played alongside Welsh folk singer [[Siân James (musician)|Siân James]], joining her on a tour of Japan in 1998.

==Death==
In 2005, Tich was staying in a house in [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]] in [[Cardiff]]. A fire broke out, after an unattended candle lit by the owner accidentally set clothes alight.&lt;ref name="inquest"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/5102910.stm | title=Rock guitarist 'trapped' in fire | work=BBC Wales | author= | date=21 June 2006 | accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tich became trapped in the attic and was overcome by thick smoke and poisonous gases. An inquest into the fire in 2006 recorded a verdict of accidental death.&lt;ref name="inquest"/&gt; A memorial concert was held for Tich at the [[Coal Exchange]] in Cardiff, and featured Welsh acts such as [[Man (band)|Man]] and [[Racing Cars]].&lt;ref name ="BBC Wales"/&gt;

'''''Tigerz''''' is a videogame in the [[Petz]] series, developed by French studio Magic Pockets and released by [[Ubisoft]] in February 2008 for the [[Nintendo DS]]. It was released after ''Petz 5'', and is therefore part of the second Petz series. Players take on the roles of Enzo and Anna, two young [[Animal training|animal trainers]] who travel the world, training animals to earn money for their family company.

'''Tigerz''' is also known as '''''Petz Wild Animals: Tigerz''''' in [[United States of America|North America]] or '''''Tigerz: Circus Adventures''''' in [[Europe]] (outside the [[United Kingdom|UK]]).

==Plot==
The game starts when Enzo and Anna, two young animal trainers, are given two [[tiger]]s by their grandfather. In order to save their family company of animal trainers from bankruptcy, they travel the world, training several show animals, to earn money.

==Gameplay==
The player's goal in the game is to train show animals, and care for the pair of tigers that have been given to the player. By use of the touchscreen and the built-in microphone, players can touch and talk to the animals to interact with them. The key part to the training is a combination of leading the animals in doing the tricks, and finding out what distracts the animals, to help them concentrate.

Besides the animal training, there is a bit of strategy that comes into play with running the animal training agency. Some people the player meet could use bad training methods with their animals or wish the player's training agency to close.

Eventually, the player works towards their own animal reserve step by step that will be able to help endangered animals all around the world.

==Missions==
There are 8 main missions, in which the player trains certain animals around the world, that are in trouble.
*The player starts with the two tigers given to them by their grandfather.
*In England the player helps a dog whose hat is too big and sometimes fall on its eyes during the performances.
*In Paris the player helps a cat that suffers from an itching crisis during the shows.
*In Russia the player helps a bear that has stomach problems while on stage.
*In San Francisco the player helps a football-team monkey.
*In India the player helps a jumping elephant.
*In New York the player helps a dancing lion.

'''Transhuman''', or '''trans-human''', is the concept of an intermediary form between [[human]] and [[Posthuman#Transhumanism|posthuman]].&lt;ref name="World Transhumanist Association 2002-2005"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Nick | last=Bostrom | authorlink=Nick Bostrom | publisher=[[World Transhumanist Association]] | title=The Transhumanist FAQ | date=2002–2005 | url=http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/FAQv21.pdf | format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate=27 August 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231225013/http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/FAQv21.pdf | archivedate=31 December 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a transhuman is a being that resembles a human in most respects but who has powers and abilities beyond those of standard humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Techno-human Shell-A Jump in the Evolutionary Gap | publisher=Sunbury Press | author=Carvalko, Joseph | year=2012 | isbn=978-1620061657}}&lt;/ref&gt; These abilities might include improved intelligence, awareness, strength, or durability. Transhumans sometimes [[Transhumanism in fiction|appear in science-fiction]] as [[cyborg]]s or [[Genetic enhancement#Genetic enhancement in humans|genetically-enhanced humans]].

== History of hypotheses ==
The use of the term "transhuman" goes back to French philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], who wrote in his 1949 book ''The Future of Mankind'':

{{Quote|Liberty: that is to say, the chance offered to every man (by removing obstacles and placing the appropriate means at his disposal) of 'trans-humanizing' himself by developing his potentialities to the fullest extent.&lt;ref name="Teilhard 1949"&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink=Pierre Teilhard | last=Teilhard | first=Pierre | title=The Future of Mankind | date=1949-02-02 | url=http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2287&amp;C=2177 | accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And in a 1951 unpublished revision of the same book:

{{Quote|In consequence one is the less disposed to reject as unscientific the idea that the critical point of planetary Reflection, the fruit of socialization, far from being a mere spark in the darkness, represents our passage, by Translation or dematerialization, to another sphere of the Universe: not an ending of the ultra-human but its accession to some sort of trans-humanity at the ultimate heart of things.&lt;ref name="Teilhard 1951"&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink=Pierre Teilhard | last=Teilhard | first=Pierre | title=The Future of Mankind | date=1950-04-27 | url=http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2287&amp;C=2182 | accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1957 book ''New Bottles for New Wine'', English evolutionary biologist [[Julian Huxley]] wrote:

{{Quote|The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself —not just sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in another way, but in its entirety, as humanity. We need a name for this new belief. Perhaps transhumanism will serve: man remaining man, but transcending himself, by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature.  "I believe in transhumanism": once there are enough people who can truly say that, the human species will be on the threshold of a new kind of existence, as different from ours as ours is from that of [[Peking man]]. It will at last be consciously fulfilling its real destiny.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1957"&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink=Julian Huxley | last=Huxley | first=Julian | title=Transhumanism | year=1957 | url=http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley | accessdate=13 January 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522082157/http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley | archivedate=22 May 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the first professors of [[futurology]], [[FM-2030]], who taught "new concepts of the Human" at [[The New School]] of New York City in the 1960s, used "transhuman" as shorthand for "transitional human". Calling transhumans the "earliest manifestation of new evolutionary beings", FM argued that signs of transhumans included physical and mental augmentations including [[prosthesis|prostheses]], [[reconstructive surgery]], intensive use of [[telecommunications]], a [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] outlook and a [[jet set|globetrotting]] lifestyle, [[androgyny]], [[reproductive technology|mediated reproduction]] (such as [[in vitro fertilisation]]), [[Eupraxsophy|absence of religious beliefs]], and a rejection of traditional [[family values]].&lt;ref name="FM-2030 1989"&gt;{{cite book | author=FM-2030 | author-link=FM-2030 | title=Are You a Transhuman?: Monitoring and Stimulating Your Personal Rate of Growth in a Rapidly Changing World | publisher=Viking Adult | year=1989 | isbn=0-446-38806-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FM-2030 used the concept of transhuman as an evolutionary transition, outside the confines of academia, in his contributing final chapter to the 1972 anthology ''Woman, Year 2000''.&lt;ref name="Vita-More 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink=Natasha Vita-More | last=Vita-More | first=Natasha | title=FM-2030 One of the Spearheading Transhumanists | year=2000 | url=http://www.transhuman.org/fm-2030story.htm | accessdate=16 February 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124193905/http://www.transhuman.org/fm-2030story.htm | archivedate=24 January 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, American [[cryonics]] pioneer [[Robert Ettinger]] contributed to conceptualization of "transhumanity" in his book ''Man into Superman''.&lt;ref name="Ettinger 1972"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ettinger | first=Robert | title=Man into Superman | year=1974 | url=http://www.cryonics.org/book2.html | publisher=Avon | isbn=0-380-00047-4 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828014330/http://www.cryonics.org/book2.html | archivedate=2013-08-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, American [[Natasha Vita-More]] authored a statement titled ''Transhumanist Arts Statement'' and outlined what she perceived as an emerging transhuman culture.&lt;ref name="Vita-More 1982"&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink=Natasha Vita-More | last=Vita-More | first=Natasha | title=Tranhumanist Arts Statement | origyear=1982| year=2003 | url=http://www.transhumanist.biz/transhumanistartsmanifesto.htm | accessdate=16 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Attali]], writing in 2006, envisaged transhumans as an altruistic vanguard of the later 21st century:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Vanguard players (I shall call them ''transhumans'') will run (they are already running) ''relational enterprises'' in which profit will be no more than a hindrance, not a final goal. Each of these transhumans will be altruistic, a citizen of the planet, at once nomadic and sedentary, his neighbor's equal in rights and obligations, hospitable and respectful of the world. Together, transhumans will give birth to planetary institutions and change the course of industrial enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2007, American physicist [[Gregory Cochran]] and [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] [[John D. Hawks|John Hawks]] published a study, alongside other recent research on which it builds, which amounts to a radical reappraisal of traditional views, which tended to assume that humans have reached an evolutionary endpoint. Physical anthropologist Jeffrey McKee argued the new findings of accelerated evolution bear out predictions he made in a 2000 book ''The Riddled Chain''. Based on computer models, he argued that evolution should speed up as a population grows because population growth creates more opportunities for new [[mutation]]s; and the expanded population occupies new environmental niches, which would drive evolution in new directions. Whatever the implications of the recent findings, McKee concludes that they highlight a ubiquitous point about evolution: "every species is a transitional species".&lt;ref name="World Science"&gt;{{cite journal | publisher=World Science | title=Human evolution, radically reappraised | date=27 March 2007 | url=http://www.world-science.net/exclusives/070326_evolution.htm | accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GCTC.jpg|thumb|right|The grounds of the Gagarin Cosmonauts Training Center]]

The '''Yuri A. Gagarin State Scientific Research-and-Testing Cosmonaut Training Center''' ('''GCTC'''; [[Russian language|Russian]]: Центр подготовки космонавтов имени Ю. А. Гагарина)&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-ru|Российский Государственный Научно-Исследовательский Испытательный Центр Подготовки Космонавтов (РГНИИЦПК) им. Ю. А. Гагарина}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|Rossiyskiy Gosudarstvenny Nauchno-Issledovatelsky Ispytatelny Tsentr Podgotovki Kosmonavtov (RGNIITsPK) im. Yu. A. Gagarina}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Russia]]n training facility responsible for training [[cosmonaut]]s for [[List of Russian manned space missions|their space missions]]. It is in [[Star City, Russia|Star City]] of [[Moscow Oblast]], a name which may refer to the facility itself or to its grounds.

==Formation==
The facility was originally known only as Military Unit 26266 or в/ч 26266, and was a secret training base for Soviet Cosmonaut candidates. The site was chosen for its proximity to Moscow and other infrastructure that would be essential for its function: Chkalovsky Airbase, and the Yaroslavl railroad.&lt;ref name=BHp30&gt;Burgess and Hall, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; The densely forested area was originally a radar range with some existing infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gctc.ru/main.php?id=242 Центр подготовки космонавтов]&lt;/ref&gt;

Military physician Colonel Yevgeny Karpov was appointed as the first chief of the cosmonaut training centre or ''Tsentr Podgotovki Kosmonavtov'' (TsPK) on February 24, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess and Hall, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; The centre was home to approximately 250 personnel divided into various departments who were responsible for the development of all aspects of the space program ranging from equipment to the well being of the cosmonauts. These included specialists in heat exchange and hygiene, survival clothing, surgery, and training staff. Initially cosmonaut candidates were housed at the nearby Frunze Central Airfield (Moscow), followed by an apartment block in Chkalovsky&lt;ref name=BHp30/&gt; before eventually moving to the newly built apartments on site where they would remain with their families throughout training&lt;ref&gt;[http://tass.ru/kosmos/4641336 Новым начальником Центра подготовки космонавтов стал Максим Харламов // ТАСС]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Civilian administration==
Until April 2009 the center was owned and operated by the [[Russian Ministry of Defense]] in cooperation with [[Roskosmos|Russian Federal Space Agency]]. On April 2009, Russia President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] signed a [[ukaz|presidential decree]] transferring the center from the Defence Ministry to the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (Roskosmos)&lt;ref&gt;Itar Tass, ''Medvedev demands hand over Cosmonauts Training Center to Roskosmos'', 10.4.09&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cosmonaut Training Center was inaugurated on January 11, 1960 in [[Star City, Russia|Star City]] outside [[Moscow]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} 
In 1969 it was named after [[Yuri Gagarin]], the first man to fly in [[Outer space|space]]. In 1995 the Cosmonaut Training Center and Air Force Test and Training regiment were merged and reorganized into its current form.{{Clarify|date=December 2010}}

==Key infrastructure==
The facility contains infrastructure essential for the training of cosmonauts across a wide range of experiences, including simulating g-loads, mission specific/suit training, medical observation/testing and astronavigation.

Key GCTC facilities include:
*Full-size [[mockup]]s of all major spacecraft developed since the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, including the [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] and [[Shuttle Buran|Buran]] vehicles, the [[TKS spacecraft|TKS modules]] and orbital stations of the [[Salyut Program]], [[Mir]], and [[International Space Station|ISS]]. These were co-existing or with time replaced one another inside two main training hangar halls of the Center. Room 1 houses the Salyut 4, 6, Mir (Don-17KS)  with Kvant (Don-37KE), Kvant 2 (Don-77KSD) and Kristall (Don-77KST) modules and a Soyuz 2 descent module simulators. Room 1A houses the Soyuz simulators (Don-7ST3 -old STK-7ST - for the Soyuz TMA;  TDK-7ST4 - old TDK-7TS2 for Soyouz TM - for the Soyuz TMM; Don-732M modified for Soyuz TM and the Pilot 732 - for the TORU docking system).Other rooms house the [[Salyut 7]], [[Spektr]] (Don-77KSO), [[Priroda]] (Don-77KSI), Buran, [[Zarya]] and [[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]] simulators.
*Zero-gravity training aircraft for simulating weightlessness (cf. [[Vomit Comet]]), including the [[MiG-15]] UTI, [[Tupolev Tu-104]] and later the [[IL-76]] MDK with internal volume of {{convert|400|m3|cuft}}. Training aircraft are based at the Russian Air Force base at [[Airport Chkalovskiy|Chkalovskiy airfield]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}
*A Medical observation clinic and testing facility.
*The original office of [[Yuri Gagarin]] and a number of monuments and busts to him and other cosmonauts.
