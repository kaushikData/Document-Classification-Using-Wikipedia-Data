'''Mr Alfred Hui Ting-hang''' (born 29 April 1988) is a male singer from [[Hong Kong people|Hong Kong]] . He is a contract-based male artist of [[TVB|Television Broadcast Limited]]. He has studied Secondary 1 to 5 at [[St. Joseph's College, Hong Kong|St. Joseph's College]] and Secondary 6 to 7 at [[German Swiss International School]] (German: Deutsch-Schweizerische Internationale Schule). He holds a bachelor's degree in Dentistry, [[The University of Hong Kong]], and holds dentistry license.  His father was the vice-chairman of Hong Kong Kidney Foundation.

In 2009, Alfred Hui participated in the first season of “[[The Voice (Hong Kong)|The Voice]]” (超級巨聲), a singing contest held by Television Broadcast Limited (TVB), the city's prominent television broadcaster, and formally began his singing career after signing a contract with the broadcaster. As one of the judges on "The Voice", [[Gary Chaw]] (曹格) is also a prominent and highly regarded singer in East Asia. His remark on how Alfred bears the resemblance of yet another fellow pop-star named [[Wu Chun]] (吳尊) from Brunei, whose record label and management is based in Taiwan, has led Alfred to gain extra publicity. Since then, Alfred was then referred to as the “Wu Chun of Tseung Kwan O” (將軍澳吳尊). Tseung Kwan O is where the broadcaster's studios are located. Alfred then joined [[Stars Shine]] (星煥國際) in 2011 and is pursuing an independent development in the pop-music circuit. Within half of the year, two individual CD albums of Alfred Hui’s songs were issued to the pop-music market.

His representational songs include “Departure” (出走) and “Ant” (螞蟻). Many music lovers cherish Alfred’s songs, and this enabled him to obtain Champions from several radio channels in Hong Kong. Later on, Alfred Hui obtained “The King of the Young Singer Award” in “The Four Major Music Media Prize-Giving Ceremony for the Hong Kong Pop Music Circuit” in 2011, “903 Music Gold Award for Young Singer” granted by [[Hong Kong Commercial Broadcasting Corporation Limited]] in 2011, "Gold Award for Young Singer" granted by “The 34th Ten Distinguished Chinese Golden Music Prize-Giving Concert” in Radio Television Hong Kong in 2011, and “[[2011 Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards|The Gold Award for the Most Favorite New Male Singer]]” granted by Television Broadcast Limited in 2011.

== Biography ==
In 2009, Alfred Hui joined "The Voice" singing contest organized by Television Broadcast Limited, which was a programme for selecting newly emerged young singers. During the contest, Alfred obtained "Award for the Highest Popularity". Then, he became a contract-based artist of Television Broadcast Limited. In 2010, Alfred sang "My Left Is Also A Kind Of Love" (我的離開也是愛) as a theme song for a TVB evening film called "[[Gun Metal Grey]]" (刑警), and this song was the first-ever composition in Alfred’s singing career. In the following year, he obtained “New Singer Recommendable Award for Emerging Excellence” in "Jade Solid Gold Prize-Giving Ceremony 2010" organized by Television Broadcast Limited.

[[File:Alfred Hui.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Alfred Hui in [[MegaBox (shopping mall)|Megabox]], [[Kowloon Bay]] (2011)]]
On 4 March 2011, Alfred Hui signed a contract with Stars Shine (星煥國際) as a Hong Kong male singer. On 28 June 2011, he issued his first personal CD-album called "A Trilogy of Departure" (出走三部曲). "Departure" (出走), a song from this CD-album, enabled him to obtain "New Singer Award" from "Champion Song From 903 Music Professional Recommendation" organized by Hong Kong Commercial Broadcasting Corporation Limited. On 16 August 2011, Alfred organized his first individual music concert, and he was regarded as a new singer who was capable to organize a concert within a short period of time after his career emergence. At the concert, Alfred announced that his CD-album was honoured as a "Golden Compact Disc". His song, called "Ant" (螞蟻), has even been selected by other singers for their performances, and these singers include [[William So]] and [[Jade Kwan]] Sum-yin . As his first CD-album received brilliant achievements, the Stars Shine (星煥國際) additionally issued a precious "CD + Live Plus DVD" version for the "A Trilogy of Departure" (出走三部曲) album on 20 October 2011.

With regards to his great reputation in "The Voice" and his remarkable music achievements, Alfred Hui further became an attractive idol among the young audiences. He obtained "The King of the Young Singer Award" in "The Four Major Music Media Prize-Giving Ceremony for the Hong Kong Pop Music Circuit" in 2011, "903 Music Gold Award for Young Singer" granted by Hong Kong Commercial Broadcasting Corporation Limited in 2011, "The 34th Ten Distinguished Chinese Golden Music Prize-Giving Concert" granted by Radio Television Hong Kong in 2011, and "The Gold Award for the Most Favorite New Male Singer" granted by Television Broadcast Limited in 2011. Excluding the RTHK, the rest of the three media channels consistently acknowledged Alfred with "Gold Awards for Young Singer", and this was a glamorous result during the initial stage of his singing career.

Half a year later, Alfred Hui issued his second CD-album, called "Blue" (藍調), on 12 January 2012. This is a rarely found phenomenon, that a newly emerged young singer can issue three CD-albums within a short period of time. On 6 February 2012, the Stars Shine (星煥國際) announced in its New Year Gathering, that Alfred’s CD-album had reached a good saleability, which corresponded to the "Golden Compact Disc" standard.

Alfred Hui represented Hong Kong to participate in the "[[ABU TV Song Festival 2012]]", which was scheduled to take place at the [[KBS Hall|KBS Concert Hall]], in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], on 14 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABU TV Song Festival 2012 Participants|url=http://esckaz.com/2012/abu_tv.htm|publisher=ESCKAZ.com|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABU TV Song Festival 2012 |url=http://www.abu2012seoul.com/s62.html |publisher=Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union |accessdate=17 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920085415/http://www.abu2012seoul.com/s62.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His third CD-album "Grandit" (長大), meaning "Growing-up" in French, was released in December 2012. The title song "Grandit" (重新長大) was released to radio on 5 September 2012 and managed to garner top places in music charts of RTHK, Metro Radio and TVB. However, it was the song "The Ode of Youth" (青春頌), which echoes the theme of the song "Grandit" and serves as the conclusion of the album, received critical acclaim. It was released to radio on 21 February 2013. Commercially, the song remained as No.1 on Commercial Radio's music chart for two consecutive weeks, breaking a record that was held for seven years. Alfred Hui was then invited to share his thoughts on a radio programme. In the programme, he revealed that the song was originally not slated for media release. The result was a surprise to him.&lt;ref name="Alfred Hui's Interview on Apr 22, 2013 on Commercial Radio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Hui's Interview on Apr 22, 2013 on Commercial Radio|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH_I_jxJhJw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Usc2013 Alfred Hui.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Alfred Hui in 2013]]
On 31 October 2013, Alfred Hui followed Herman Ho Chit-to (何哲圖), Chief Executive Officer of Stars Shine (星煥國際), to join the Voice Entertainment Group Limited (星夢娛樂). His contract was then transferred to the new company. On 20 December 2013, it was the first attempt for Alfred Hui to issue the first-ever album with a record of both his new songs and his former representational selections, and this individual album was called "The Times" (時光). On 28 and 29 December 2013, "The Times – Alfred Hui Solo Concert 2013" (許廷鏗時光演唱會2013) was organized at the Star Hall (匯星) of [[Kowloonbay International Trade &amp; Exhibition Centre]] (九龍灣國際展貿中心), which marked a historic breakthrough for Alfred's pop-music career.

==Etymology of the word ''Basque''==
[[File:Barscunes transparent.png|thumb|right|Barscunes coin, Roman period]]
The English word ''Basque'' may be pronounced {{IPAc-en|b|ɑː|s|k}} or {{IPAc-en|b|æ|s|k}} and derives from the French ''Basque'' ({{IPA-fr|bask}}), which is derived from [[Gascon language|Gascon]] ''Basco'' (pronounced {{IPA|/ˈbasku/}}), cognate with Spanish ''Vasco ''(pronounced {{IPA|/ˈbasko/}}). These, in turn, come from [[Latin]] ''Vasco'' (pronounced {{IPA|/wasko/}}), plural ''[[Vascones]]'' (see History section below). The Latin [[labial-velar approximant]] /w/ generally [[betacism|evolved into]] the [[bilabial]]s /b/ and /β̞/ in Gascon and Spanish, probably under the influence of Basque and [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]], a language related to old Basque and spoken in [[Gascony]] in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] (similarly the Latin /w/ evolved into /v/ in [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and other languages).

Several coins from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC found in the Basque Country bear the inscription ''barscunes''. The place where they were minted is not certain, but is thought to be somewhere near [[Pamplona]], in the heartland of the area that historians believe was inhabited by the ''Vascones''. Some scholars have suggested a Celtic etymology based on ''bhar-s-'', meaning "summit", "point" or "leaves", according to which ''barscunes'' may have meant "the mountain people", "the tall ones" or "the proud ones", while others have posited a relationship to a [[proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] root ''*bar-'' meaning "border", "frontier", "march".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/130014?idi=en&amp;clave=130014&amp;op=4&amp;primR=1&amp;regs=10&amp;EIKVOGEN=Barscunes&amp;pos=4&amp;epi=120849#mrc1 |title=Vascones - el nombre (Auñamendi Encyclopedia) |publisher=Euskomedia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Basque, people call themselves the ''euskaldunak'', singular ''euskaldun'', formed from ''euskal-'' (i.e. "Basque (language)") and ''-dun'' (i.e. "one who has"); ''euskaldun'' literally means a Basque speaker. Not all Basques are Basque-speakers. Therefore, the [[neologism]] ''euskotar'', plural ''euskotarrak'', was coined in the 19th century to mean a culturally Basque person, whether Basque-speaking or not. Alfonso Irigoyen posits that the word ''euskara'' is derived from an ancient Basque verb ''enautsi'' "to say" (cf. modern Basque ''esan'') and the suffix ''-(k)ara'' ("way (of doing something)"). Thus ''euskara'' would literally mean "way of saying", "way of speaking". One item of evidence in favour of this hypothesis is found in the Spanish book ''Compendio Historial'', written in 1571 by the Basque writer [[Esteban de Garibay]]. He records the name of the Basque language as ''enusquera''. It may, however, be a writing mistake.

In the 19th century, the Basque nationalist activist [[Sabino Arana]] posited an original root ''euzko'' which, he thought, came from ''eguzkiko'' ("of the sun", related to the assumption of an original [[Solar deity|solar religion]]). On the basis of this putative root, Arana proposed the name [[Basque Country (greater region)|Euzkadi]] for an independent Basque nation, composed of seven Basque historical territories. Arana's neologism ''Euzkadi'' (in the regularized spelling Euskadi) is still widely used in both Basque and Spanish, since it is now the official name of the [[Autonomous Community]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].

Since the Basque language is unrelated to Indo-European, it has long been thought to represent the people or culture that occupied Europe before the spread of Indo-European languages there. A comprehensive analysis of Basque genetic patterns has shown that Basque genetic uniqueness predates the [[Neolithic Revolution|arrival of agriculture]] in the Iberian Peninsula, about 7,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Basque tribes were mentioned in Roman times by Strabo and Pliny, including the [[Vascones]], [[Novempopulania|the Aquitani]], and others. There is enough evidence to support the hypothesis that at that time and later they spoke old varieties of the Basque language (see: [[Aquitanian language]]).

In the Early Middle Ages the territory between the [[Ebro]] and [[Garonne]] rivers was known as [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], a vaguely defined ethnic area and political entity struggling to fend off pressure from the Iberian [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Arab rule to the south]], as well as the [[Franks|Frankish]] push from the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Trask, R.L.| year = 1997 | title= The History of Basque | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lbLbAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14 | location=New York, USA | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-13116-2 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"&gt;{{cite book |title=

The Kingdom of Pamplona, a central Basque realm, later known as [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], underwent a process of feudalization and was subject to the influence of its much larger Aragonese, Castilian and French neighbours. Castile deprived Navarre of its coastline by conquering [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|key western territories]] (1199–1201), leaving the kingdom landlocked. The Basques were ravaged by the [[War of the Bands]], bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. Weakened by the Navarrese civil war, the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|bulk of the realm eventually fell]] before the onslaught of the Spanish armies (1512–1524). However, [[Lower Navarre|the Navarrese territory north of the Pyrenees]] remained beyond the reach of an increasingly powerful Spain. [[Lower Navarre]] became a province of France in 1620.

Nevertheless, the Basques enjoyed a great deal of self-government [[End of Basque home rule in France|until the French Revolution (1790)]] and the [[Carlist Wars]] (1839, 1876), when the Basques supported heir apparent [[Infante Carlos of Spain, Count of Molina|Carlos V]] and his descendants. On either side of the Pyrenees, the Basques [[End of Basque home rule in Spain|lost their native institutions and laws]] held during the ''[[Ancien régime]]''. Since then, despite the current limited self-governing status of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and Navarre as settled by the Spanish Constitution, many Basques have attempted higher degrees of self-empowerment (see [[Basque nationalism]]), sometimes by acts of violence. [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]], and [[Soule]] were integrated into the [[Departments of France|French department system]] (starting 1790), with Basque efforts to establish a region-specific political-administrative entity failing to take off to date. However, in January 2017, a single agglomaration community was established for the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country in France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Garicoix |first=Michel |date=2017-12-29|title=Le Pays basque se constitue en communauté d’agglomération|trans-title=The Basque Country is established as a agglomeration community|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/12/29/le-pays-basque-se-constitue-en-communaute-d-agglomeration_5055172_823448.html |language=French |work= |location= |access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Political and administrative divisions===
[[File:Ekialderantz Urkulutik.JPG|thumb|Mountains of the Basque Country]]
[[File:Leitza.JPG|thumb|[[Leitza]], in Navarre, Basque Country]]
The Basque region is divided into at least three administrative units, namely the [[Basque Autonomous Community]] and [[Navarre]] in Spain, and the [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissement]] of [[Bayonne]] and the [[cantons of France|cantons]] of [[Mauléon-Licharre]] and [[Tardets-Sorholus]] in the ''[[département]]'' of [[Pyrénées Atlantiques]], France.

The autonomous community (a concept established in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]) known as ''Euskal Autonomia Erkidegoa'' or EAE in Basque and as ''Comunidad Autónoma Vasca'' or CAV in Spanish (in English: ''Basque Autonomous Community'' or BAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.euskadi.net/euskalterm/ |title=See EUSKALTERM, the Basque Public Term Bank, maintained by the Basque Government for these and other terms and their common translations |publisher=.euskadi.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510193253/http://www1.euskadi.net/euskalterm/ |archivedate=May 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is made up of the three Spanish provinces of [[Álava]], [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]]. The corresponding Basque names of these territories are ''Araba'', ''Bizkaia'' and ''Gipuzkoa'', and their Spanish names are ''Álava'', ''Vizcaya'' and ''Guipúzcoa''.

The BAC only includes three of the seven provinces of the currently called historical territories. It is sometimes referred to simply as "the Basque Country" (or ''Euskadi'') by writers and public agencies only considering those three western provinces, but also on occasions merely as a convenient abbreviation when this does not lead to confusion in the context. Others reject this usage as inaccurate and are careful to specify the BAC (or an equivalent expression such as "the three provinces", up to 1978 referred to as "Provincias Vascongadas" in Spanish) when referring to this entity or region. Likewise, terms such as "the Basque Government" for "the government of the BAC" are commonly though not universally employed. In particular in common usage the French term ''Pays Basque'' ("Basque Country"), in the absence of further qualification, refers either to the whole [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] ("Euskal Herria" in Basque), or not infrequently to the [[Northern Basque Country|northern (or "French") Basque Country]] specifically.

Under Spain's present constitution, Navarre (''Nafarroa'' in present-day Basque, ''Navarra'' historically in Spanish) constitutes a separate entity, called in present-day Basque ''Nafarroako Foru Erkidegoa'', in Spanish ''Comunidad Foral de Navarra'' (the autonomous community of Navarre). The government of this autonomous community is the Government of Navarre. Note that in historical contexts Navarre may refer to a wider area, and that the present-day northern Basque province of [[Lower Navarre]] may also be referred to as (part of) ''Nafarroa'', while the term "High Navarre" (''Nafarroa Garaia'' in Basque, ''Alta Navarra'' in Spanish) is also encountered as a way of referring to the territory of the present-day autonomous community.

There are three other historic provinces parts of the Basque Country: [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]] and [[Soule]] (''Lapurdi, Nafarroa Beherea'' and ''Zuberoa'' in Basque; ''Labourd, Basse-Navarre'' and ''Soule'' in French), devoid of official status within France's present-day political and administrative territorial organization, and only minor political support to the Basque nationalists. A large number of regional and local nationalist and non-nationalist representatives have waged a campaign for years advocating for the creation of a separate Basque [[département]], while these demands have gone unheard by the French administration.

===Population, main cities and languages===
[[File:Olentzero, Beasain.jpg|thumb|[[Olentzero]] in [[Gipuzkoa]], Basque Country]]
There are 2,123,000 people living in the Basque Autonomous Community (279,000 in Alava, 1,160,000 in Biscay and 684,000 in Gipuzkoa). The most important cities in this region, which serve as the provinces' administrative centers, are [[Bilbao]] (in Biscay), [[San Sebastián]] (in Gipuzkoa) and [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] (in Álava). The official languages are Basque and Spanish. Knowledge of Spanish is compulsory under the Spanish constitution (article no. 3), and knowledge and usage of Basque is a right under the Statute of Autonomy (article no. 6), so only knowledge of Spanish is virtually universal. Knowledge of Basque, after declining for many years during [[Spain under Franco|Franco's dictatorship]] owing to official persecution, is again on the rise due to favorable official language policies and popular support. Currently about 33 percent of the population in the Basque Autonomous Community speaks Basque.

Navarre has a population of 601,000; its administrative capital and main city, also regarded by many nationalist Basques as the Basques' historical capital, is Pamplona (''Iruñea'' in modern Basque). Only Spanish is an official language of Navarre, and the Basque language is only co-official in the province's northern region, where most Basque-speaking Navarrese are concentrated.

About a quarter of a million people live in the [[French Basque Country]]. Nowadays Basque-speakers refer to this region as ''Iparralde'' (Basque for North), and to the Spanish provinces as ''Hegoalde'' (South). Much of this population lives in or near the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz (BAB) urban belt on the coast (in Basque these are ''Baiona'', ''Angelu'' and ''Miarritze''). The Basque language, which was traditionally spoken by most of the region's population outside the BAB urban zone, is today rapidly losing ground to French. The French Basque Country's lack of self-government within the French state is coupled with the absence of official status for the Basque language in the region. Attempts to introduce bilingualism in local administration have so far met direct refusal from French officials.

Large numbers of Basques have left the Basque Country to settle in the rest of Spain, France or other parts of the world in different historical periods, often for economic or political reasons. Historically the Basques abroad were often employed in shepherding and ranching and by maritime fisheries and merchants. Millions of Basque descendants (see [[Basque American]] and [[Basque Canadian]]) live in North America (the United States; Canada, mainly in the provinces of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Quebec]]), Latin America (in all 23 countries), South Africa, and Australia.

[[Miguel de Unamuno]] said: "There are at least two things that clearly can be attributed to Basques: the [[Society of Jesus]] and the [[Republic of Chile]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Pedro|last=Laín Entralgo|authorlink=Pedro Laín Entralgo|url=http://www.filosofia.org/hem/194/alf/ez2302a.htm|title=Chile al trasluz|trans-title=Chile held up to the light|language=es|publisher=Filosofia.org|date=January 1949|accessdate=2 November 2016|quote='La Compañía de Jesús y la República de Chile son las dos grandes hazañas del pueblo vascongado', solía decir don Miguel de Unamuno...

Basque place names are to be found, such as [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]] (now [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Durango]], Mexico), [[Biscayne Bay]] (Guatemala), and [[Aguereberry Point]] (United States).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basqueed.org/BEO%20Basque%20Culture%20Day%202007.htm |title=Basque Culture Day |publisher=Basqueed.org |date=2007-10-06 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nueva Vizcaya was the first province in the north of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Mexico) to be explored and settled by the Spanish. It consisted mostly of the area which is today the states of Chihuahua and Durango.

In Mexico most Basques are concentrated in the cities of [[Monterrey]], [[Saltillo]], [[Reynosa]], [[Camargo, Chihuahua|Camargo]], and the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Durango]], [[Nuevo León]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Coahuila]]. The Basques were important in the mining industry; many were ranchers and vaqueros ([[cowboy]]s), and the rest opened small shops in major cities such as [[Mexico City]], [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]] and [[Puebla]]. In [[Guatemala]], most Basques have been concentrated in [[Sacatepequez Department]], [[Antigua Guatemala]], [[Jalapa Department|Jalapa]] for six generations now, while some have migrated to [[Guatemala City]].

In Colombia, Basques settled mainly in [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] and the [[Colombian coffee growing axis|Coffee Axis]]. It is estimated that nearly 2,500,000 persons from all Antioquia (40% of this [[Departments of Colombia|department]]) have Basque ancestry, as well, in the 19th century about 10% of Colombia's total population were Basque descendants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/riev/32/32443444.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2016}} Antioquia has one of the biggest concentrations of Basques descendants around the world.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In 1955, Joaquín Ospina said: "Is there something more similar to the Basque people than the "''antioqueños''".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lehendakaritza.ejgv.euskadi.eus/r48-contcvpv/en/contenidos/informacion/03_andres_irujo/en_airujo/adjuntos/antioquia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Also, writer Arturo Escobar Uribe said in his book "''Mitos de Antioquia''" (Myths of Antioquia) (1950): "Antioquia, which in its clean ascendance predominates the peninsular farmer of the Basque provinces, inherited the virtues of its ancestors... Despite the predominance of the white race, its extension in the mountains... has projected over Colombia's map the prototype of its race; in [[Medellín]] with the industrial [[Paisa region|paisa]], entrepreneur, strong and steady... in its towns, the adventurer, arrogant, world-explorer... Its myths, which are an evidence of their deep credulity and an indubitable proof of their Iberian ancestor, are the sequel of the conqueror's blood which runs through their veins...".&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Escobar Uribe (1950).

The largest of several important Basque communities in the United States is in the area around [[Boise, Idaho]], home to the Basque Museum and Cultural Center, host to an annual Basque festival, as well as a festival for the Basque diaspora every five years. [[Reno, Nevada]], where the Center for Basque Studies and the Basque Studies Library are located at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]], is another significant nucleus of Basque population. [[Elko, Nevada]] sponsors an annual Basque festival that celebrates the dance, cuisine and cultures of the Basque peoples of Spanish, French and Mexican nationalities who have arrived in [[Nevada]] since the late 19th century.

[[Texas]] has a large percentage of Hispanics descended from Basques who participated in the conquest of [[New Spain]]. Many of the original [[Tejano]]s had Basque blood, including those who fought in the [[Battle of the Alamo]] alongside many of the other Texans. Along the Mexican/Texan border, many Basque surnames can be found. The largest concentration of Basques who settled on Mexico's north-eastern "frontera", including the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Durango]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo León]], and [[Tamaulipas]], also settled along Texas' [[Rio Grande River]] from [[South Texas]] to [[West Texas]]. Many of the historic ''hidalgos'', or noble families from this area, had gained their titles and land grants from Spain and Mexico; they still value their land. Some of North America's largest ranches, which were founded under these colonial land grants, can be found in this region.

[[California]] has a major concentration of Basques, most notably in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] between [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]. The city of Bakersfield has a large Basque community and the city has several Basque restaurants, including Noriega's which won the 2011 James Beard Foundation America's Classic Award. There is a history of Basque culture in [[Chino, California]]. In Chino, two annual Basque festivals celebrate the dance, cuisine, and culture of the peoples. The surrounding area of [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] has many Basque descendants as residents. They are mostly descendants of settlers from Spain and Mexico. These Basques in California are grouped in the group known as ''[[Californio]]s''.

Basques of European Spanish-French and Latin American nationalities also settled throughout the western U.S. in states like [[Louisiana]], [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

==Culture==
{{Basque culture}}

===Language===
{{Main article|Basque language}}
The identifying language of the Basques is called Basque or ''Euskara'', spoken today by 25%-30%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eke.org/euskara/soziolinguistika|title=Sociolinguistics|publisher=Eke.org|date=|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the region's population. An idea of the central place of the cultural terms in Basque nationalist politicians is given by the fact that, in Basque, Basques identify themselves by the term ''euskaldun'' and their country as ''Euskal Herria'', literally "Basque speaker" and "Country of the Basque Language" respectively. The language has been made a political issue by official Spanish and French policies restricting its use either historically or currently; however, this has not stopped the teaching, speaking, writing, and cultivating of this increasingly vibrant minority language. This sense of Basque identity tied to the local language does not exist in isolation. It is juxtaposed with an equally strong sense of national identity tied with the use of the Spanish and [[French language]]s among other Basques. As with many European states, a regional identity, be it linguistically derived or otherwise, is not mutually exclusive with the broader national one. For example, Basque [[France national rugby union team|rugby union]] player for France, [[Imanol Harinordoquy]], has said about his national identity:&lt;blockquote&gt;I am French and Basque. There is no conflict, I am proud of both. . . . I have friends who are involved in the political side of things but that is not for me. My only interest is the culture, the Euskera language, the people, our history and ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/france/2431544/France-look-to-Basque-prodigy.html |title=France look to Basque prodigy |first=Brendan |last=Gallagher |work=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |date=27 February 2002 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result of state language promotion, school policies, the effects of mass media and migration, today virtually all Basques (except for some children below school age) speak the official language of their state (Spanish or French). There are extremely few Basque monolingual speakers: essentially all Basque speakers are bilingual on both sides of the border. Spanish or French is typically the first language of citizens from other regions (who often feel no need to learn Basque), and Spanish or French is also the first language of many Basques, all of which maintains the dominance of the state tongues of both France and Spain. Recent Basque Government policies aim to change this pattern, as they are viewed as potential threats against mainstream usage of the minority tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Xabier|last=Aierdi Urraza|url=http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07/en_integraz/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07.html|title=Routes to linguistic and cultural integration for immigrants in the Basque Autonomous Community|publisher=euskara.euskadi.net|date=24 July 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302214808/http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07/en_integraz/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07.html|archivedate=2 March 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basque language is thought to be a [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] [[language isolate]] in contrast with other European languages, almost all of which belong to the broad [[Indo-European language family]]. Another peculiarity of Basque is that it has been spoken continuously ''[[in situ]]'', in and around its present territorial location, for longer than other modern European languages, which were all introduced in historic or prehistoric times through population migrations or other processes of cultural transmission.&lt;ref name="Trask1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trask|first=Robert Lawrence|authorlink=Larry Trask|title=The History of Basque|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OiemTo_t5r8C|accessdate=3 November 2016|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}

However, popular stereotypes characterizing Basque as "the oldest language in Europe" and "unique among the world's languages" may be misunderstood and lead to erroneous assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moreno Cabrera|first=Juan Carlos|url=http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik12_1_aurreiritziak_06_10/en_aurreiri/artik12_1_aurreiritziak_06_10.html|title=Misconceptions about Basque|publisher=euskara.euskadi.net|date=19 October 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302214757/http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik12_1_aurreiritziak_06_10/en_aurreiri/artik12_1_aurreiritziak_06_10.html|archivedate=2 March 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, Basque has remained in continuous contact with neighboring western European languages with which it has come to share numerous lexical properties and typological features; it is therefore misleading to exaggerate the "outlandish" character of Basque. Basque is also a modern language, and is established as a written and printed one used in present-day forms of publication and communication, as well as a language spoken and used in a very wide range of social and cultural contexts, styles, and registers.

===Land and inheritance===
[[File:ArangurenDorretxea.jpg|thumb|right|The Aranguren baserri in [[Orozko]], converted from a fortified tower]]
[[File:BaserriLizarralde.jpg|thumb|right|The Lizarralde baserri ([[Bergara]])]]
Basques have a close attachment to their home (''etxe(a)'' 'house, home'), especially when this consists of the traditional self-sufficient, family-run farm or ''[[baserri]](a)''. Home in this context is synonymous with family roots. Some [[Basque surnames]] were adapted from old ''baserri'' or [[habitation name]]s. They typically related to a geographical orientation or other locally meaningful identifying features. Such surnames provide even those Basques whose families may have left the land generations ago with an important link to their rural family origins: ''Bengoetxea'' "the house of further down", ''Goikoetxea'' "the house above", ''Landaburu'' "top of the field", ''Errekondo'' "next to the stream", ''Elizalde'' "by the church", ''Mendizabal'' "wide hill", ''Usetxe'' "house of birds" ''Ibarretxe'' "house in the valley", ''Etxeberria'' "the new house", and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[[Koldo Mitxelena|MITXELENA, Koldo]], ''Apellidos vascos'' (fifth edition), San Sebastián: Txertoa, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to surrounding regions, ancient Basque inheritance patterns, recognised in the ''[[fueros]],'' favoured survival of the unity of inherited land holdings. In a kind of primogeniture, these usually were inherited by either the eldest male or female. As in other cultures, the fate of other family members depended on the assets of a family: wealthy Basque families tended to provide for all children in some way, while less-affluent may have had only one asset to provide to one child. However, this heir often provided for the rest of the family (unlike in England, with strict primogeniture, where the eldest son inherited everything and often did not provide for others). Even though they were provided for in some way, younger siblings had to make much of their living by other means. Before the advent of industrialisation, this system resulted in the emigration of many rural Basques to Spain, France or the Americas. Harsh by modern standards, this custom resulted in a great many enterprising figures of Basque origin who went into the world to earn their way, from Spanish [[conquistador]]s such as [[Lope de Aguirre]] and Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, to explorers, missionaries and saints of the Catholic Church, such as [[Francis Xavier]].

A widespread belief that Basque society was originally [[matriarchal]] is at odds with the current, clearly [[patrilineal]] kinship system and inheritance structures. Some scholars and commentators have attempted to reconcile these points by assuming that patrilineal kinship represents an innovation. In any case, the social position of women in both traditional and modern Basque society is somewhat better than in neighbouring cultures, and women have a substantial influence in decisions about the domestic economy. In the past, some women participated in collective magical ceremonies. They were key participants in a rich folklore, today largely forgotten.

===Cuisine===
{{Main article|Basque cuisine}}
[[Basque cuisine]] is at the heart of Basque culture, influenced by the neighboring communities and the excellent produce from the sea and the land. A 20th-century feature of Basque culture is the phenomenon of [[gastronomical society|gastronomical societies]] (called ''[[txoko]]'' in Basque), food clubs where men gather to cook and enjoy their own food. Until recently, women were allowed entry only one day in the year. Cider houses ([[Sagardotegi]]ak) are popular restaurants in Gipuzkoa open for a few months while the cider is in season.

===Cultural production===
[[File:Artzaiak inudeak 2009 001.jpg|thumb|Artzaiak eta inudeak festival, [[Donostia]], Basque Country.]]
At the end of the 20th century, despite [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] violence (ended in 2010) and the crisis of heavy industries, the Basque economic condition recovered remarkably. They emerged from the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime with a revitalized language and culture. The Basque language expanded geographically led by large increases in the major urban centers of Pamplona, Bilbao, and Bayonne, where only a few decades ago the Basque language had all but disappeared. Nowadays, the number of Basque speakers is maintaining its level or increasing slightly.

===Music===
{{Main article|Basque music}}
[[File:Basque dance.JPG|thumb|Basque dance]]

===Religion===
Traditionally Basques have been mostly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. In the 19th century and well into the 20th, Basques as a group remained notably devout and churchgoing. In recent years church attendance has fallen off, as in most of Western Europe. The region has been a source of missionaries like [[Francis Xavier]] and [[Michel Garicoïts]]. [[Ignatius Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus]], was a Basque. [[California]] [[Franciscan]] [[Fermín Lasuén]] was born in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]]. Lasuén was the successor to Franciscan Padre [[Junípero Serra]] and founded 9 of the 21 extant [[California Missions]] along the coast.

A sprout of [[Protestantism]] in the continental Basque Country produced the first translation of the new Testament into Basque by [[Joanes Leizarraga]]. Queen [[Jeanne III of Navarre]], a devout [[Huguenot]], commissioned the translation of the New Testament into Basque and Béarnese for the benefit of her subjects. By the time [[Henry IV of France|Henry III of Navarre]] converted to Roman Catholicism in order to become king of France, Protestantism virtually disappeared from the Basque community.

[[Bayonne]] held a Jewish community composed mainly of [[Sephardi Jews]] fleeing from the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s. There were also important Jewish and [[Muslim]] communities in [[Navarre]] before the Castilian invasion of 1512-21.

Nowadays, according to one single opinion poll, only slightly more than 50% of Basques profess some kind of belief in [[God]], while the rest are either [[agnostic]] or [[atheist]]. The number of religious skeptics increases noticeably for the younger generations, while the older ones are more religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.com/argazki/forum_re/caracterizacion.pdf|title=Opinion poll on religion by GIZAKER|publisher=[[EITB]] the Basque Country's public broadcast service.|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=2010-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qYGtTnn7?url=http://www.eitb.com/argazki/forum_re/caracterizacion.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Roman Catholicism]] is, by far, the largest religion in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. In 2012, the proportion of Basques that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 58.6%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=La Vanguardia |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vangdata/20150402/54429637154/interactivo-creencias-y-practicas-religiosas-en-espana.html |title=Interactivo: Creencias y prácticas religiosas en España |publisher=Lavanguardia.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it is one of the most secularized communities of Spain: 24.6% were non-religious and 12.3% of Basques were [[atheist]].

====Pre-Christian religion and mythology====
{{Main article|Basque mythology}}
{{more footnotes|date=February 2016}}
[[File:Amboto 01.jpg|thumb|[[Anboto]] mountain is one of sites where [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]] was believed to dwell]]
[[File:Dolmen de Sorginetxe.jpg|thumb|Sorginetxe dolmen next to the stream and cave Lezao, home to legends featuring mythological character [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]]]]

[[Christianization|Christianisation]] of the Basque Country has been the topic of some discussion. There are broadly speaking two views. According to one, Christianity arrived in the Basque Country during the 4th and 5th centuries but according to the other, it did not take place until the 12th and 13th centuries. The main issue lies in the different interpretations of what is considered Christianisation. Early traces of Christianity can be found in the major urban areas from the 4th century onwards, a bishopric from 589 in Pamplona and three hermit cave concentrations (two in Álava, one in Navarre) were in use from the 6th century onwards. In this sense, Christianity arrived "early".

Pre-Christian belief seems to have focused on a goddess called [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]]. A number of place-names contain her name and would suggest these places were related to worship of her such as ''[[Anbotoko Mari]]'' who appears to have been related to the weather. According to one tradition, she travelled every seven years between a cave on Mount [[Anboto]] and one on another mountain (the stories vary); the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, dry when she was in [[Aloña]], or [[Supelegor]], or [[Gorbea]]. One of her names, ''Mari Urraca'' possibly ties her to an historical Navarrese princess of the 11th and 12th century, with other legends giving her a brother or cousin who was a Roman Catholic priest. So far the discussions about whether the name Mari is original and just happened to coincide closely with the Christian name María or if Mari is an early Basque attempt to give a Christian veneer to pagan worship have remained speculative. At any rate, Mari (Andramari) is one of the oldest worshipped Christian icons in Basque territories.

Mari's consort is [[Sugaar]]. This [[chthonic]] couple seem to bear the superior ethical power and also the power of creation and destruction. It's said that when they gathered in the high caves of the sacred peaks, they engendered the storms. These meetings typically happened on Friday nights, the day of historical [[Akelarre (witchcraft)|akelarre]] or [[coven]]. Mari was said to reside in Mount [[Anboto]]; periodically she crossed the skies as a bright light to reach her other home at mount [[Txindoki]].

Legends also speak of many and abundant genies, like ''[[jentilak]]'' (equivalent to [[giant (mythology)|giants]]), ''lamiak'' (equivalent to [[nymph]]s), ''[[mairu]]ak'' (builders of the cromlechs or stone circles, literally [[Moors]]), ''iratxoak'' ([[imp]]s), ''[[sorginak]]'' ([[witch]]es, priestess of Mari), and so on. [[Basajaun]] is a Basque version of the [[Woodwose]]. This character is probably an anthropomorphism of the bear. There is a [[trickster]] named ''[[San Martin Txiki]]'' ("St Martin the Lesser").

It has been shown that some of these stories have entered Basque culture in recent centuries or as part of Roman ''[[superstition]]''. It is unclear whether [[neolithic]] stone structures called [[dolmen]]s have a religious significance or were built to house animals or resting shepherds. Some of the dolmens and [[Stone circles|cromlechs]] are burial sites serving as well as border markers.
[[File:Ioaldunak 001.jpg|thumb|''Ioaldunak'' dancers of Navarre.]]
The ''jentilak'' ('[[Giant (mythology)|Giants]]'), on the other hand, are a legendary people which explains the disappearance of a people of [[Stone Age]] culture that used to live in the high lands and with no knowledge of the iron. Many legends about them tell that they were bigger and taller, with a great force, but were displaced by the ''ferrons'', or workers of ironworks foundries, until their total fade-out. They were pagans, but one of them, [[Olentzero]], accepted Christianity and became a sort of Basque [[Santa Claus]]. They gave name to several toponyms, as ''[[Jentilbaratza]]''.

===Society===
Historically, Basque society can be described as being somewhat at odds with Roman and later European societal norms.

[[Strabo]]'s account of the north of Spain in his ''[[Geographica]]'' (written between approximately 20 BC and 20 AD) makes a mention of "a sort of woman-rule—not at all a mark of civilization" (Hadington 1992), a first mention of the—for the period—unusual position of women. "Women could inherit and control property as well as officiate in churches. Combined with the issue of lingering pagan beliefs, this enraged the leaders of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], perhaps leading to [[Logroño trials|one of the largest witch hunts]] in the Basque town of [[Logroño]] in 1610".&lt;ref name="Hadingham"&gt;Hadingham 1992. Note that [[Logroño]] is not a Basque town, but it was the see of the [[diocese|diocesis]] covering [[Zugarramurdi]] in 1610. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] rarely acted against witches, devoting most of its attention to [[Judaizers]], [[Morisco]]s and Protestants.&lt;/ref&gt;

This preference for female dominance existed well into the 20th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...[[matrilineal]] inheritance laws, and agricultural work performed by women continued in Basque country until the early twentieth century. For more than a century, scholars have widely discussed the high status of Basque women in law codes, as well as their positions as judges, inheritors, and arbitrators through ante-Roman, medieval, and modern times. The system of laws governing succession in the French Basque region reflected total equality between the sexes. Up until the eve of the French Revolution, the Basque woman was truly ‘the mistress of the house', hereditary guardian, and head of the lineage.&lt;ref name="treilo"&gt;Gimbutas, M. ''The Living Goddesses'' University of California Press: 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the [[kingdom of Navarre]] did adopt feudalism, most Basques also possessed unusual social institutions different from those of the rest of feudal Europe. Some aspects of this include the [[elizate]] tradition where local house-owners met in front of the church to elect a representative to send to the ''juntas'' and ''[[Juntas Generales]]'' (such as the ''Juntas Generales de Vizcaya'' or ''Guipúzcoa'') which administered much larger areas. Another example was the fact that in the medieval period most land was owned by the farmers, not the Church or a king.&lt;ref name="Trask1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref name="oprmay"&gt;Collins, R. ''The Basques'' Blackwell: 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pelota===

The great family of ball games has its unique offspring among Basque ball games, known generically as [[pilota]] (Spanish: ''pelota''). Some variants have been exported to the United States and [[Macau]] under the name of [[Jai Alai]].

===Rural sports===

{{Main article|Basque rural sports}}
There are several sports derived by Basques from everyday chores. Heavy workers were challenged and bets placed upon them. Examples are:

===Bull runs and bullock games===
The [[encierro]] (bull run) in [[Pamplona]]'s [[festival|fiestas]] ''[[San Fermín|Sanfermines]]'' started as a transport of bulls to the ring. These encierros, as well as other bull and [[Cattle|bullock]] related activities are not exclusive to Pamplona but are traditional in many towns and villages of the Basque country.

===Football===
{{Main article|Basque Country national football team}}
There are several clubs within the Basque Country, such as [[Athletic Bilbao]], [[Real Sociedad]], [[Deportivo Alavés]], [[SD Eibar]] and, as Navarre club, the [[CA Osasuna]] (the only club in [[La Liga]] that has a Basque name — ''osasuna'' means "health"). In the 2016-2017 season these five clubs played together in La Liga, the first instance where five Basque clubs have reached that level at the same time. Athletic's [[Athletic Bilbao signing policy|recruitment policy]] has meant the club refuses to sign any non-Basque players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.athletic-club.eus/en/club.html | title = Athletic Club Official Site - Club overview including 'code'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real Sociedad also previously employed such a policy.

===Rugby union===
[[Rugby union]] is a popular sport among French Basques, with major clubs [[Biarritz Olympique]] and [[Aviron Bayonnais]] traditional powerhouses in the premier division of French Rugby (the [[Top 14]]). Biarritz regularly play [[Heineken Cup]] matches, especially knockout matches, at [[Estadio Anoeta]] in [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]]. Games between the Basque clubs and Catalan club [[USA Perpignan]] are always hard fought.

===Professional cycling===
Cycling is popular and the [[Euskaltel-Euskadi]] professional cycling team, partly sponsored by the Basque Government participated in the UCI World Tour division until 2014. Known for their orange tops and hill-climbing ability, their fans were famous for lining the famous Pyrenean climbs in the Tour de France, in support of their compatriots.

Each April the week-long [[Tour of the Basque Country]] showcases the beautiful rolling Basque countryside. [[Miguel Indurain]], born in [[Villava]] is one of the most celebrated cyclists in the world having won 5 consecutive [[Tour de France|Tours de France]].

While there is no independent Basque state, Spain's [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of the Basque Country, made up of the provinces of Álava (Araba), Biscay (Bizkaia) and Gipuzkoa, is primarily a historical consequence and an answer to the wide autonomy claim of its population.

Navarre has a separate statute of autonomy, a contentious arrangement designed during Spanish transition to democracy (the ''Amejoramiento'', an 'upgrade' of its previous status during dictatorship). It refers back to the kingdom status of Navarre (up to 1841) and their traditional institutional and legal framework ([[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|charters]]). Basque, the original and main language of Navarre up to the late 18th century, has kept family transmission especially in the northern part of Navarre and central areas to a lesser extent, designated as Basque speaking or mixed area in Navarrese law. Questions of political, linguistic and cultural allegiance and identity are highly complex in Navarre. Politically some Basque nationalists would like to integrate with the Basque Autonomous Community.

The [[French Basque Country]] today does not exist as a formal political entity and is officially simply part of the French [[department (country subdivision)|department]] of [[Pyrénées Atlantiques]], centered in [[Béarn]]. In recent years the number of mayors of the region supporting the creation of a separate Basque department has grown to 63.87%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maire-info.com/territoires/departements/64-des-maires-basques-favorables-un-departement-pays-basque-article-6264 |title=64% des maires basques favorables à un département Pays Basque |date=2 Nov 2005 |work= |publisher=Maire-info.com |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, their attempts have been unsuccessful.

==Political conflicts==

===Language===
{{Main article|Basque language}}
{{See also|Basque Country (greater region)#Language}}

Both the Spanish and French governments have, at times, suppressed Basque [[natural language|linguistic]] and cultural identity. The [[French Republics (disambiguation)|French Republics]], the epitome of the [[nation-state]], have a long history of attempting the complete cultural absorption of cultural minority groups. Spain has, at most points in its history, granted some degree of linguistic, cultural, and even political autonomy to its Basques, but under the [[Spain under Franco|regime of Francisco Franco]], the Spanish government reversed the advances of Basque nationalism, as it had fought in the opposite side of the [[Spanish Civil War]]: cultural activity in Basque was limited to folkloric issues and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

Today, the [[Southern Basque Country]] within Spain enjoys an extensive cultural and political autonomy. The majority of schools under the jurisdiction of the [[Basque education system]] use Basque as the primary medium of teaching. However, the situation is more delicate in the [[French Basque Country|Northern Basque Country]] within France, where Basque is not officially recognized, and where lack of autonomy and monolingual public schooling in French exert great pressure on the Basque language.

In Navarre, Basque has been declared an endangered language, since the anti-Basque and conservative government of [[Navarrese People's Union]] opposes the symbols of Basque culture,&lt;ref&gt;Resolution of the General Assembly of the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages, 13 September 2003 (Helsinki), on the situation of the Basque language in the Autonomous Community of Navarre. Reported in MERCATOR Butlleti 55: "Speakers of a regional or minority language should have the right to use their language in private and public life. Contrary to these principles, local authorities from Iruña/Pamplona (capital city of the Autonomous Community of [[Navarre]] in Spain) have been implementing a series of reforms to the Autonomous Community legislation limiting the use of the Basque language. Basque is the only endangered language in the Autonomous Community of Navarre..."&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting a Spanish identity for Navarre.

Basque is also spoken by immigrants in the major cities of Spain and France, in [[Australia]], in many parts of [[Latin America]], and in the [[United States]], especially in Nevada, Idaho, and California.&lt;ref name="Trask1997"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

===Political status and violence===
[[File:Muralbelfast2.jpg|thumb|A republican mural in [[Belfast]] showing solidarity with [[Basque nationalism]].]]

Since its articulation by Sabino Arana in the late 19th century, the more radical currents of [[Basque nationalism]] have demanded the right of [[self-determination]] and even [[independence]]. Within the Basque country, this element of Basque politics is often in balance with the conception of the Basque Country as just another part of the Spanish state, a view more commonly espoused on the right of the political spectrum. In contrast, the desire for greater autonomy or independence is particularly common among [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalists. The right of self-determination was asserted by the [[Basque Parliament]] in 2002 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/pp-and-pse-voted-against-basque-parliament-adopts-resolution-on-s?itemId=B24_18787&amp;cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&amp;idioma=en |title=EITB: ''Basque parliament adopts resolution on self-determination'' |publisher=Eitb24.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since self-determination is not recognized in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], a wide majority of Basques abstained (55%) and some even voted against it (23.5%) in the ratification referendum of December 6 of that year. However, it was approved by clear [[majority]] overall in Spanish (87%). The autonomous regime for the Basque Country was approved in a 1979 referendum but the autonomy of Navarre (''Amejoramiento del Fuero'': "improvement of the charter") was never subject to a referendum but only approved by the Navarrese Cortes (parliament).

==Classification==
As with their language, the Basques are clearly a distinct cultural group in their region. They regard themselves as culturally and especially linguistically distinct from their surrounding neighbours. Some Basques identify themselves as Basques only whereas others identify themselves both as Basque and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Euskobarómetro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehu.es/cpvweb/paginas/series_eusko/series_13.html|title=Evolución de la identidad nacional subjetiva de los vascos, 1981-2006|trans-title=Evolution of the subjective national identity of the Basques, 1981-2006|language=es|publisher=[[Euskobarómetro]]|date=2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622071009/http://www.ehu.es/cpvweb/paginas/series_eusko/series_13.html|archivedate=22 June 2007|postscript=: 33% of the Basque Autonomous Community in late 2006 identified as only being Basque.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Basques regard the designation as a "cultural minority" as incomplete, favouring instead the definition as a nation, the commonly accepted designation for the Basque people up to the rise of the nation-states and the definition imposed by the [[History of the Basque people#Revolution and war|1812 Spanish Constitution]].

In modern times, as a European people living in a highly industrialized area, cultural differences from the rest of Europe are inevitably blurred, although a conscious cultural identity as a people or nation remains very strong, as does an identification with their homeland, even among many Basques who have emigrated to other parts of Spain or France, or to other parts of the world.

The strongest distinction between the Basques and their traditional neighbours is linguistic. Surrounded by [[Romance languages|Romance-language]] speakers, the Basques traditionally spoke (and many still speak) a language that was not only non-Romance but non-Indo-European. The prevailing belief amongst Basques, and forming part of their national identity, is that their language has continuity with the people who were in this region since not only pre-Roman and pre-Celtic times, but since the Stone Age.

==Genetics==
[[File:06_laiatzen.jpg|thumb|Basque peasants [[Laia (tool)|ploughing]]]]
In 1920, [[H. G. Wells]] referred to the [[Mediterranean race]] as the ''Iberian race''. He regarded it as a fourth subrace of the Caucasian race, along with the ''Aryan'', ''Semitic'', and ''Hamitic'' subraces. He stated that the main [[ethnic group]] that most purely represented the racial stock of the Iberian race was the Basques, and that the Basques were the descendants of the [[Cro-Magnons]].&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H. G. ''[[The Outline of History]]'' New York: 1920, Doubleday &amp; Co., Volume I, Chapter XI "The Races of Mankind," Pages 131-144 See Pages 98, 137, and 139&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, in his book ''The History and Geography of Human Genes'', [[population geneticist]] [[L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] stated that "there is support from many sides" for the hypothesis that the Basques are the descendants of the original Cro-Magnons.&lt;ref&gt;^ Cavalli-Sforza, L. Luca; Menozzi, Paolo; and Piazza Alberto. ''The History and Geography of Human Genes'' Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jóvenes con trajes vascos en Zubieta (1 de 3) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|[[Basque people]] in 1927]]
Even before the development of modern [[genetics]] based on [[DNA sequencing]], Basques were already noted for distinctive genetic patterns, such as possessing the highest global apportion of the [[Rh blood group system|Rh-]] blood type (35% phenotypically, 60% genetically). Additionally, the Basque population has virtually no [[ABO blood group system|B blood type]], nor the related AB type. They have a high rate of O blood group but this is probably due to isolation.

Although they are genetically distinctive in some ways, the Basques are still very typically European in terms of their [[Y-DNA]] and [[mtDNA]] sequences, and in terms of some other genetic [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]. These same sequences are widespread throughout the western half of Europe, especially along the western fringe of the continent.&lt;ref name="Dupanloup2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pericic2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pericic|first=M.|author2=etal|title=High-Resolution Phylogenetic Analysis of Southeastern Europe Traces Major Episodes of Paternal Gene Flow Among Slavic Populations|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=22|issue=10|year=2005|pages=1964–1975|format=PDF|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/10/1964.full.pdf|doi=10.1093/molbev/msi185|pmid=15944443|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctiveness noted by studies of 'classical' genetic markers (such as blood groups) and the apparently "pre-Indo-European" nature of the Basque language has resulted in a popular and long-held view that Basques are "living fossils" of the earliest [[Anatomically modern humans|modern humans]] who colonized Europe.&lt;ref name="Alonso2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alonso|first=Santos|author2=etal|title=The place of the Basques in the European Y-chromosome diversity landscape|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|publisher=Springer Nature|volume=13|issue=12|year=2005|pages=1293–1302|format=PDF|url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v13/n12/pdf/5201482a.pdf|doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201482|pmid=16094307|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies of the [[Y-chromosome]] found that on their direct male lineages, the vast majority of modern Basques have a common ancestry with other Western Europeans, namely a marked predominance of [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup R1b]].&lt;ref name="Alonso2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=J.

Initially Haplogroup R1b was theorised to be that a Palaeolithic marker, introduced when Europe was repopulated after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], about 25,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/290/5494/1155.short |title=The Genetic Legacy of Paleolithic Homo sapiens sapiens in Extant Europeans: A Y Chromosome Perspective |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2000-11-10 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Basque populations were used as proxy representatives for the "Palaeolithic component" in admixture studies that tried to quantify the extent of Neolithic diffusions. Such studies concluded that the main components in the European genomes appear to derive from ancestors whose features were similar to those of modern Basques and people of the [[Near East]] (or Western Asia), with average values greater than 35% for both these parental populations, regardless of whether molecular information is taken into account or not. The smallest degree of both Basque and Near Eastern admixture is found in Finland, whereas the highest values are, respectively, 70% "Basque" in Spain and roughly 60% "[[Near East]]ern" in the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name="Dupanloup2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dupanloup|first=I.|author2=etal|format=PDF|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/7/1361.full.pdf|title=Estimating the Impact of Prehistoric Admixture on the Genome of Europeans|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=21|issue=7|year=2004|pages=1361–1372|doi=10.1093/molbev/msh135|pmid=15044595|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=p.1365 Table 3}} This theory encountered inconsistencies even prior to most recent chronological re-evaluations. That R1b should be a Palaeolithic marker was an ''ad hoc'' assumption suggested by Semino ''et al.'' (2000) and propagated by subsequent scholars without further analysis. Higher resolution [[STR analysis]] of R1b lineages from other western European populations (e.g. Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Y chromosome genetic variation in the Italian peninsula is clinal and supports an admixture model for the Mesolithic-Neolithic encounter|date=2013-01-30 |pmid=17275346 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.11.030 |volume=44 |journal=Mol.

More recent studies instead propose that R1b spread through Europe from southwest Asia in the Neolithic period or later, between 4,000 and 8,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Balaresque"&gt;{{Cite journal | first1=Patricia | last1=Balaresque | first2=Georgina R. | last2=Bowden | first3=Susan M. | last3=Adams | first4=Ho-Yee | last4=Leung | first5=Turi E. | last5=King | first6=Zoë H. | last6=Rosser | first7=Jane | last7=Goodwin | first8=Jean-Paul | last8=Moisan | first9=Christelle | last9=Richard | first10=Ann | last10=Millward | first11=Andrew G. | last11=Demaine | first12=Guido | last12=Barbujani | first13=Carlo | last13=Previderè | first14=Ian J. | last14=Wilson | first15=Chris | last15=Tyler-Smith | first16=Mark A. | last16=Jobling | display-authors = 5 | year = 2010 | title = A Predominantly Neolithic Origin for European Paternal Lineages | journal = [[PLOS Biology]] | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages=e1000285 | publisher = [[Public Library of Science]] | pmc=2799514 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000285 | pmid=20087410 | editor1-last=Penny | editor1-first=David | url = http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000285 | accessdate = August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crawford2007"&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|last1=Arredi|first1=Barbara|author2=Estella S Poloni|author3=Chris Tyler-Smith|editor=Michael H.

[[Autosome|Autosomal genetic]] studies have confirmed that Basques share:
* close genetic ties to other [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]], especially with [[Spaniards]], who have a common genetic identity of over 70% with Basques.&lt;ref name="Dupanloup2004"/&gt;
* homogeneity amongst both their Spanish and French populations, according to high-density SNP genotyping study done in May 2010,&lt;ref name="Dupanloup2004"/&gt; and;
* a genomic distinctiveness, relative to other European populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodríguez-Ezpeleta|first1=Naiara|author2=etal|title=High-density SNP genotyping detects homogeneity of Spanish and French Basques, and confirms their genomic distinctiveness from other European populations|journal=Human Genetics|volume=128|issue=1|pages=113–7|year=2010|pmid=20443121|doi=10.1007/s00439-010-0833-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ancient DNA samples have been recovered and amplified from Palaeolithic sites in the Basque region. The collection of mtDNA haplogroups sampled there differed significantly compared to their modern frequencies. The authors concluded that there is "discontinuity" between ancient and modern Basques.&lt;ref name="jogg.info"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ellen|last=Levy-Coffman|url=http://www.jogg.info/22/Coffman.htm|title=We Are Not Our Ancestors:  Evidence for Discontinuity between Prehistoric and Modern Europeans|publisher=Journal of Genetic Genealogy|date=17 August 2006|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, while Basques harbour some very archaic lineages (such as mtDNA Hg U8a),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=González|first=Ana M.|author2=Oscar García|author3=José M. Larruga|author4=Vicente M. Cabrera|title=The mitochondrial lineage U8a reveals a Paleolithic settlement in the Basque country|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=7|date=23 May 2006|issue=1|page=124|pmid=16719915|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-7-124|pmc=1523212}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are not of "undiluted Palaeolithic ancestry", nor are they ancestral to large parts of western Europe. Rather, their genetic distinctiveness is a result of centuries of low population size, genetic drift and endogamy.

===New genetic findings, 2015===
In 2015, a new scientific study of Basque DNA was published which seems to indicate that Basques are descendants of [[Neolithic]] farmers who mixed with local [[Mesolithic]] hunters before becoming genetically isolated from the rest of Europe for millennia.&lt;ref name="thescientist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Bob|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/43950/title/Ancient-DNA-Elucidates-Basque-Origins/|title=Ancient DNA Elucidates Basque Origins|publisher=the-scientist.com|date=9 September 2015|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mattias Jakobsson from Uppsala University in Sweden analysed genetic material from eight Stone Age human skeletons found in El Portalón Cavern in [[Atapuerca Mountains|Atapuerca]], northern Spain. These individuals lived between 3,500 and 5,500 years ago, after the transition to farming in southwest Europe. The results show that these early Iberian farmers are the closest ancestors to present-day Basques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34175224|title=Ancient DNA cracks puzzle of Basque origins|publisher=BBC News|date=7 September 2015|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official findings were published in ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' of the United States.&lt;ref name="GüntherValdiosera2015"/&gt; According to the study, the "results show that the Basques trace their ancestry to early farming groups from Iberia, which contradicts previous views of them being a remnant population that trace their ancestry to Mesolithic hunter-gatherer groups." These early Neolithic farmer ancestors of the Basques, however, additionally mixed with local southwestern hunter-gatherers, and "the proportion of hunter gatherer-related admixture into early farmers also increased over the course of two millennia." This admixed group was also found to be ancestral to other modern-day Iberian peoples, but while the Basques remained relatively isolated for millennia after this time, later migrations into Iberia led to distinct and additional admixture in all other Iberian groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-09-ancient-genomes-link-early-farmers.html|title=Ancient genomes link early farmers to Basques|publisher=phys.org|date=7 September 2015|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the high incidence of R1b among Basques can be attributed to an invasion by [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] warriors who intermarried with local women, who then raised the resulting children in their culture, not that of their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eupedia.com/genetics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- specific article? --&gt;

==Notable Basques==
{{Main article|List of Basques}}
Among the most notable Basque people are [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] (led the first successful expedition to circumnavigate the globe after [[Ferdinand Magellan]] died mid-journey); [[Sancho III of Navarre]]; and [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and [[Francis Xavier]], founders of the [[Society of Jesus]]. [[Diego de Gardoqui|Don Diego María de Gardoqui y Arriquibar]] (1735–1798) was Spain's first Ambassador to the United States. [[Miguel de Unamuno]] was a noted novelist and philosopher of the late 19th and the 20th century.

'''Bertha Gxowa''' (née '''Mashaba''' November 26, 1934 - November 19, 2010) was an anti-[[apartheid]] and [[women's rights]] activist and [[Trade union|trade unionist]] in [[South Africa]].

Gxowa took part in the [[Defiance Campaign]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gxowa was one of the founding members of the [[Federation of South African Women]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She also was one of the organizers for the [[Women's March (South Africa)|Women's March]] on the Union Building in 1956 which protested pass laws.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gxowa, along with [[Helen Joseph]], traveled across South Africa to collect signatures on 20,000 petitions which were presented at the march.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

She was eventually accused of treason in 1956 in the [[1956 Treason Trial|Treason Trial]] and remained on trial until 1959.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was banned under the [[Suppression of Communism Act, 1950|Suppression of Communism Act]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Calvin H. Borel''' (born November 7, 1966) is an [[Americans|American]] [[jockey]] in [[thoroughbred horse race|thoroughbred horse racing]] and rode the victorious mount in the [[2007 Kentucky Derby]], the [[2009 Kentucky Derby]] and the [[2010 Kentucky Derby]]. His 2009 Derby win with [[Mine That Bird]] was the [[Donerail|second biggest upset]] in Derby history, and Borel's winning margin of {{frac|6|3|4}} lengths was the greatest in Derby history since [[Assault (horse)|Assault]] won by 8 lengths in 1946.  On May 1, 2009, Borel won the [[Kentucky Oaks]] aboard  [[Rachel Alexandra]], only the second time since 1993 that a jockey has won the Oaks-Derby combo, and just the seventh time overall a jockey has accomplished this feat in the same year.&lt;ref name="kentucky1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Story |first=Mark |url=http://www.kentucky.com/2009/05/05/784501/rail-hugging-rides-are-borels.html |title=Rail-hugging rides are Borel's signature - Kentucky Derby |publisher=Kentucky.com |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2009, Borel won the 2009 [[Preakness Stakes]] at [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]] with thoroughbred filly [[Rachel Alexandra]].  In doing so, Borel became the first jockey to win the first two jewels of the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] on different mounts. Borel's nickname is "Bo'rail'" due to his penchant for riding close to the rail to save ground.

==Life and career==
Calvin Borel hails from south [[Louisiana]]: the heart of [[Cajun]] Country, and famous for having produced a number of top jockeys.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Like [[Randy Romero]], [[Kent Desormeaux]], [[Eddie Delahoussaye]] and [[Shane Sellers]].  Borel began racing horses in the [[bush track]]s near his hometown of Catahoula and started riding in match races at the age of eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/horse/triplecrown09/news/story?id=4231703|author=Marty McGee|title=A day in the life of Calvin Borel|publisher=ESPN|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his Cajun accent and bubbly and emotional personality, both of which were on full display during his post-victory interview after all three of his Kentucky Derby wins.

Borel's older brother, Cecil, had a brief career as a thoroughbred jockey but was not able to maintain his weight.  He turned to [[horse training|training horses]] at Delta Downs in [[Vinton, Louisiana]]. Calvin began his professional riding career at Delta Downs.

Over a career that has spanned 25 years, Borel has become known for his tireless work ethic as well as an ability to slip up the rail to save ground; his colleagues and racing fans therefore frequently refer to him as "Calvin Bo-rail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntra.com/stats_bios.aspx?id=21093 |title=Calvin Borel |publisher=NTRA |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504052757/http://www.ntra.com/stats_bios.aspx?id=21093 |archivedate=May 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2009/news/2009/01/24/beethoven-breezes-holy-bull |author=Brisnet Editorial |title=Beethoven breezes for Holy Bull &amp;#124; Kentucky Derby 135 |date=January 24, 2009 |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210080622/http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2009/news/2009/01/24/beethoven-breezes-holy-bull |archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borel is {{height|ft=5|in=4}} and {{convert|116|lb|kg}}.  He lives in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].
His riding career began to surge in June 2006 when he won the $750,000 [[Stephen Foster Handicap]] at Churchill Downs with 91–1 longshot Seek Gold, getting up in the final stride to win by a nose over [[Perfect Drift]] and paying $185.40 to win. That year was his big break when he won his first [[Breeders' Cup]] on Street Sense in the [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile]].

Borel then won the 2007 [[Kentucky Derby]] aboard [[Street Sense (horse)|Street Sense]], guiding the colt to a {{frac|2|1|4}} length victory over [[Hard Spun]]. He next had a close second-place finish aboard Street Sense in the Preakness Stakes to [[Curlin]].

On July 5, 2007, Borel became the sixth jockey in the history of Churchill Downs to win six races on a single race card.  With his victory in the July 5, 2008 [[Bashford Manor Stakes]], he became the thirty-fourth jockey in [[North American]] Thoroughbred racing history to win 4,500 races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=3474800|author=Marty McGee|title=Borel hits 4,500 with 18-1 shot - Horse Racing|publisher=ESPN|date=July 5, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May 2, 2009, saw Borel win the Kentucky Derby on [[Mine That Bird]], a 50–1 long shot, a day after winning the [[Kentucky Oaks]] aboard favorite [[Rachel Alexandra]]. It was only the second time since 1993 that a jockey has won the Oaks-Derby combo, and he was just the seventh jockey overall to accomplish this feat in the same year.&lt;ref name="kentucky1"/&gt;

On May 16, 2009, Borel won the Preakness Stakes on [[Rachel Alexandra]] (after that horse was sold following the Derby). This accomplishment marked the first time that a jockey won the first two legs of the Triple Crown on different horses, and Borel, with a win in the Belmont, could become the first Triple Crown winner since [[Steve Cauthen]] accomplished it in 1978 on Affirmed. A win would have made him only the second individual to win the Triple Crown by sweeping the races with different horses ([[D. Wayne Lukas]], a trainer, also did so in 1995). However, on June 6, 2009, Borel finished 3rd on Mine That Bird in the [[Belmont Stakes]], failing to accomplish a jockey Triple Crown.

On June 27, 2009, he guided Rachel Alexandra to a {{frac|19|1|4}} victory in the Mother Goose Stakes at Belmont Park, setting a new stakes record, the only horse to break a record held by the great filly [[Ruffian (horse)|Ruffian]]. Borel then rode her to a six-length victory over [[Belmont Stakes]] winner [[Summer Bird]] in the [[Haskell Invitational]].

On September 5 of the same year, he rode Rachel Alexandra to a historic victory in the Woodward Stakes. It was the first time a filly of any age had won that storied race.

Borel was named the winner of the 2010 George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award.

On May 1, 2010, he rode [[Super Saver (horse)|Super Saver]] to win his 3rd Kentucky Derby in a 4-year span, the first jockey ever to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pedulla|first=Tom|title=Jockey Calvin Borel makes Derby his old Kentucky home|work=USA Today|date=May 3, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/horses/2010-05-02-calvin-borel-derby-folo_N.htm|accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the race, Borel promised that he would win the Triple Crown in 2010, but  he lost the Preakness.

On June 4, 2010, Borel became only the second jockey to win 1,000 career races at Churchill Downs, joining Hall of Famer Pat Day.

On August 20, 2011, Borel was arrested in [[Evansville, Indiana]] for allegedly driving while intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Council|first=Jared|title=Derby-Winning Jockey Calvin Borel Faces DWI Charge|work=Evansville Courier &amp; Press|date=2011-08-21|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2011/aug/21/EV_jockey|accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2013, Borel earned his 5000th victory at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas while riding Hezunusual in the 6th race. He dedicated the win to his agent of over 20 years, Jerry Hissam who retired that year due to chronic pancreas issues after undergoing gall bladder surgery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drf.com/news/oaklawn-park-jockey-agent-jerry-hissam-retiring-due-illness|accessdate=2017-06-12{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Borel is the 26th North American jockey to reach 5000 victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jockey Calvin Borel claims career win No. 5,000|work=SF Gate|date=March 7, 2013|url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Jockey-Calvin-Borel-claims-career-win-No-5-000-4337278.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borel played himself in the 2014 feature film ''[[50 to 1]]'', about Mine that Bird's 2009 Kentucky Derby win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drf.com/news/borel-impresses-hollywood-co-stars-50-1 "Borel impresses Hollywood co-stars in '50 to 1'"]. ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'', March 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2016, Borel announced he would be retiring from horse racing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/horses/triple/derby/2016/03/30/report-kentucky-derby-winning-jockey-borel-retires/82418266/ Derby-winning jockey Calvin Borel retiring] ''[[The Courier Journal]]'', March 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on August 15, he came out of retirement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1599">'''Claude Moët''' (1683–1760) was a [[France|French]] [[Winemaker|vintner]] and [[wine]] merchant who founded the [[Champagne]] house that later became [[Moët &amp; Chandon|Moët et Chandon]]. Moët was the first winemaker in [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]] to exclusively produce [[sparkling wine]]. An expert salesman, Moët advocated the importance of personal contact with customers. During the 1730s, he networked extensively within the royal circles of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] and soon became one of few merchants accredited to serve the royal court. One of his most loyal customers was the [[Madame de Pompadour]].&lt;ref name="Kladstrup pg 47-48"&gt;D. &amp; P. Kladstrup ''Champagne'' pg 47-48 Harper Collins Publisher {{ISBN|0-06-073792-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death the champagne house went to the control of his grandson [[Jean-Rémy Moët]]. And soon after he died from a heart attack.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Family history==
The Moët family can trace its origins to a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] soldier named LeClerc who fought alongside [[Joan of Arc]] in fending off [[England|English]] attempts at preventing the crowning of [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]]. As a reward for his service, the King changed his name to Moët.&lt;ref name="Kladstrup pg 48"&gt;D. &amp; P. Kladstrup ''Champagne'' pg 48 Harper Collins Publisher {{ISBN|0-06-073792-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Debra Morgan''' (spelled '''Deborah''' in the novels) is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Jeff Lindsay (writer)|Jeff Lindsay]] for his ''Dexter'' book series. She also appears in the [[Dexter (TV series)|television series]], based on Lindsay's books, portrayed by [[Jennifer Carpenter]]. In Lindsay's novels, she first appeared in ''[[Darkly Dreaming Dexter]],'' and was featured in every novel in the series.

==Character history==

===Early life===
Debra was born to [[List of Dexter characters#Doris Morgan|Doris]] (Kathrin Lautner Middleton) and [[Harry Morgan (Dexter)|Harry Morgan]] ([[James Remar]]) on December 7, 1979.&lt;ref name="Every Silver Lining"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Every Silver Lining|episodelink=Dexter (season 8)#ep2|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=July 7, 2013|season=8|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later became foster sister to [[Dexter Morgan]] ([[Michael C. Hall]]). A tough, foul-mouthed tomboy, she craved her father's attention and envied Dexter for the amount of time Harry spent with him, unaware that Harry was training him to be a vigilante [[serial killer]].

At the age of 16, her mother died of cancer. From then on, she decided to become a detective, like her father. Debra learned to shoot taking her father's gun. Dexter found out and told Harry, who punished her. Hurt, Debra told Dexter that she wished that Harry had never brought him home. She was immediately remorseful for saying it, however, and apologized.

She was distraught at her father's death and, inspired by his career, joined the Miami-Metro Police Department. She spent three years in patrol and then another two years in vice before being promoted by [[List of Dexter characters#Tom Matthews|Captain Tom Matthews]] ([[Geoff Pierson]]) (a friend of her father), becoming a Homicide officer at the start of the first season.

Debra is characterized as smart and capable, yet unsure of herself, and so she relies upon Dexter's seemingly limitless expertise on murderers to solve difficult cases. Initially assigned to Vice, she is desperate to be transferred to Homicide. After Matthews promotes her, she starts to grow self-confident, relying less on Dexter's abilities and more on her own.

===Season one===
Newly promoted to the homicide department, Debra's first case is a series of murders committed by "The Ice Truck Killer", who preys on prostitutes and leaves their dismembered bodies in refrigerated trucks. She works hard on the case, but her progress is hampered by her own insecurity and her antagonistic relationship with Lieutenant [[Maria LaGuerta]] ([[Lauren Vélez]]).

She starts dating, and eventually falls in love with, [[List of Dexter characters#Brian Moser|Rudy Cooper]] ([[Christian Camargo]]); unbeknownst to her, he is actually the Ice Truck Killer, and is only dating her in order to get close to Dexter. At the end of the season, Rudy proposes to her and she accepts. Rudy &amp;mdash; who is actually Brian Moser, Dexter's biological brother &amp;mdash; then kidnaps her to reveal himself to Dexter. He binds her to a table in the same manner that Dexter kills his victims, while Dexter and Brian discuss her fate. Dexter ultimately saves her life, and reluctantly kills Brian to keep her safe.&lt;ref name="born"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Born Free|episodelink=Dexter (season 1)#ep12|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=December 16, 2006|season=1|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season two===
Debra is frail at the start of season two, still recovering from her ordeal with the Ice Truck Killer; she feels that she is not a good detective because she didn't spot that her fiancé was a serial killer. However, FBI agent [[Frank Lundy]] ([[Keith Carradine]]) reassures her otherwise and they, mid-season, develop a romantic relationship, which ends when he is called away from Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=There's Something About Harry|episodelink=Dexter (season 2)#ep10|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=December 2, 2007|season=2|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stays in Dexter's house while she deals with the trauma.

Debra is appalled when she finds out that Dexter is cheating on his girlfriend, [[Rita Bennett]] ([[Julie Benz]]), with his [[Narcotics Anonymous]] sponsor, [[List of Dexter characters#Lila Tournay|Lila Tournay]] ([[Jaime Murray]]), of whom she is immediately suspicious. Debra eventually threatens to have Lila deported upon finding out that she murdered her ex-boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Left Turn Ahead|episodelink=Dexter (season 2)#ep11|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=December 9, 2007|season=2|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the season finale, "[[The British Invasion (Dexter)|The British Invasion]]", she helps Dexter rescue Rita's two children from a fire that Lila had started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The British Invasion|episodelink=Dexter (season 2)#ep12|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=December 16, 2007|season=2|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the season, she has regained her confidence, and she is more determined than ever to improve her career and get a detective shield.

===Season three===
As season three begins, Debra has had her hair cut to shoulder length, and has "sworn off men, liquor and smokes". She is working with a new partner, Detective [[Joey Quinn]] ([[Desmond Harrington]]), but has been approached by [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] officer [[List of Dexter characters#Yuki Amado|Yuki Amado]] ([[Liza Lapira]]), who tells her that her partner is being investigated for corruption. She refuses to assist in the investigation, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Our Father|episodelink=Dexter (season 3)#ep1|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=September 28, 2008|season=3|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is originally part of the team investigating the murder of [[List of Dexter characters#Miguel Prado|Miguel Prado]]'s ([[Jimmy Smits]]) brother [[List of Dexter characters#Oscar Prado|Oscar]] (Nick Hermz), but because of her lack of tact and people skills she is removed from the case by the newly promoted [[Angel Batista]] ([[David Zayas]]). The case she has been assigned to, the murder of a young woman, is eventually found to have been connected to the ongoing case of a serial killer called "[[List of Dexter characters#Jorge Orozco|The Skinner]]" ([[Jesse Borrego]]), which she solves with the help of confidential informant [[List of Dexter characters#Anton Briggs|Anton Briggs]] ([[David Ramsey]]). The two begin a relationship after she saves his life. Because of her success on the Skinner case, Debra receives her detective shield at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Do You Take Dexter Morgan?|episodelink=Dexter (season 3)#ep12|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=December 14, 2008|season=3|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season four===
At the beginning of the season, Dexter tells Debra that Harry slept with one of his confidential informants. She investigates the files on Harry's informants and interviews them, hoping to find the one Harry slept with. One of the files is shown to be [[List of Dexter characters#Laura Moser|Laura Moser]] ([[Sage Kirkpatrick]]). Her relationship with Anton begins to suffer at this point, especially when Lundy returns to Miami to hunt the [[Arthur Mitchell (Dexter)|Trinity Killer]] ([[John Lithgow]]). They sleep together and renew their relationship, but the very same night they are both shot &amp;mdash; Lundy fatally &amp;mdash; by an unknown assailant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Dex Takes a Holiday|episodelink=Dexter (season 4)#ep4|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=October 8, 2009|season=4|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debra blames herself, and laments to Dexter that she is "broken".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Dirty Harry|episodelink=Dexter (season 4)#ep5|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=October 25, 2009|season=4|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She puts aside her grief when she comes to suspect that the Trinity Killer was the shooter, and opens an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=If I Had a Hammer|episodelink=Dexter (season 4)#ep6|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=November 1, 2009|season=4|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After consulting with forensics technician [[Vince Masuka]] ([[C. S. Lee]]), however, Debra deduces that Trinity could not have been the shooter. During a Thanksgiving dinner with Dexter's family, Debra remembers a conversation she had with reporter [[List of Dexter characters#Christine Hill|Christine Hill]] ([[Courtney Ford]]), and realizes Hill has knowledge of the shooting that no one outside the police department knew about, and concludes that she was the shooter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Hungry Man|episodelink=Dexter (season 4)#ep9|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=November 22, 2009|season=4|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is proven true in a later episode revealing that Hill is Trinity's daughter. Hill confesses to Debra that she killed Lundy, moments before she commits [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Hello, Dexter Morgan|episodelink=Dexter (season 4)#ep11|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=December 6, 2009|season=4|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debra then renews her search for Harry's mistress, and finds out about Laura Moser, and the fact that Dexter and the Ice Truck Killer are brothers. She tells Dexter the news (which he already knew), and then tells him that he is "the one consistently good thing" in her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Getaway|episodelink=Dexter (season 4)#ep12|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=December 13, 2009|season=4|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season five===
Debra begins an intimate relationship with Quinn while trying to support Dexter following Rita's murder (portrayed in the season four finale, "[[The Getaway (Dexter)|The Getaway]]"). She and Quinn are assigned to the "Barrel Girls" case, in which 13 women were [[rape]]d, [[torture]]d and murdered by a group of men, and left in barrels in a swamp. The police find [[DVD]]s the killers recorded of the crimes, and Debra is assigned to study them. She figures out that [[Jordan Chase]] ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]), a prominent public speaker, is involved with the group of men killing the girls, but cannot prove her suspicion because he never appears on the DVDs. However, she is able to track him down by the end of the season, and finds his body, moments after Dexter and [[Lumen Pierce]] ([[Julia Stiles]]) - one of the Barrel Girl killers' surviving victims and Dexter's lover and "protegé"- have killed him. She sees them at the crime scene through a wall of plastic sheeting, and tells them that she needs to call in the crime scene. She gives them an hour head start because she sympathizes with Lumen, but she never finds out that Dexter was involved.&lt;ref name="big"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Big One|episodelink=Dexter (season 4)#ep12|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=December 12, 2010|season=4|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the season, Debra finds out that Quinn, who believes that Dexter was involved in Rita's murder, has been investigating Dexter behind her back. Debra is very upset at Quinn and confronts him. Quinn decides that his relationship with Debra is more important than his (supposedly) unfounded suspicions about Dexter, and stops his investigation. At the end of the season, they have reconciled, and attend Dexter's son Harrison's birthday party together.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt;

===Season six===
At the start of the season, Quinn proposes to Debra, but she rejects him and ends their relationship.&lt;ref name="once"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Once Upon a Time...|episodelink=Dexter (season 6)#ep2|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=October 9, 2011|season=6|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing awkwardness is made worse when she is promoted to Lieutenant, thanks in part to LaGuerta's political machinations.&lt;ref name="once"/&gt; Debra earns the respect of the office, but struggles with the idea of some people not feeling 'open' to her anymore because of her new job. The job is also very stressful in itself, and she comes to doubt whether she can handle the responsibility. Her work and personal troubles weighing down on her, she begins to attend therapy. Matthews attempts to make a deal with her about covering up his involvement in the death of a prostitute, but before she can take any action, LaGuerta tells Matthews' superiors about his indiscretion and lets Debra take the fall for it. At the end of the season, her therapist helps her realize that she has been in love with Dexter all along. She finally makes peace with the idea &amp;mdash; on the same day that she catches Dexter in the act of murdering "Doomsday Killer" [[List of Dexter characters#Travis Marshall|Travis Marshall]] ([[Colin Hanks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=This is the Way the World Ends|episodelink=Dexter (season 6)#ep12|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=December 18, 2011|season=6|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season seven===
In [[Are You...?|the season premiere]], Debra witnesses Dexter murder Travis Marshall. Dexter claims that he went to collect evidence, and was surprised by Marshall; he then says that he "snapped" and killed him on impulse. Debra reluctantly helps him burn down the abandoned church where he killed Marshall, destroying the evidence of the crime. Later, Dexter comes home to Debra, who is surrounded by Dexter's victim's blood slides, a pack of knives, and other tools that Dexter uses to kill. Debra reluctantly asks Dexter if he is a serial killer. Dexter, taken aback, replies yes. Horrified, Debra recoils from Dexter as he admits that he is the "Bay Harbor Butcher", and that Harry taught him how to get away with murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Are You...?|episodelink=Dexter (season 7)#ep1|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=September 30, 2012|season=7|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reading Lundy's files on serial killers, Debra says she wants to help Dexter, and make sure he doesn't kill again. Dexter agrees, even though he doesn't really have a choice, as Debra (probably) would have arrested him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Sunshine and Frosty Swirl|episodelink=Dexter (season 7)#ep2|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=October 7, 2012|season=7|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dexter slips away from Debra long enough to dispose of Ray Speltzer ([[Matt Gerald]]), a serial killer she had tried and failed to send to prison. Debra admits that she understands why Dexter takes the law into his own hands, and tells him that she will not stop him as long as he does not tell her about it or interfere with Miami Metro investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Run|episodelink=Dexter (season 7)#ep1|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=October 21, 2012|season=7|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She even compromises her own professional ethics by falsifying evidence to mislead LaGuerta, who is trying to reopen the Bay Harbor Butcher case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Swim Deep|episodelink=Dexter (season 7)#ep5|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=October 28, 2012|season=7|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their truce is threatened when Dexter begins dating [[Hannah McKay]] ([[Yvonne Strahovski]]), a serial poisoner who Debra is intent on arresting for the murder of [[List of Dexter characters#Sal Price|Sal Price]] ([[Santiago Cabrera]]), a writer she had feelings for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Chemistry|episodelink=Dexter (season 7)#ep7|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=November 18, 2012|season=7|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debra eventually confesses her feelings for Dexter in a moment of frustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Argentina|episodelink=Dexter (season 7)#ep8|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=November 18, 2012|season=7|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debra gets into a near-fatal car accident after a confrontation with Hannah. She is convinced Hannah poisoned her, and Dexter is suspicious enough to order a toxicology screen on a bottle of water in Debra's car. The results prove that Hannah did indeed poison Debra, leaving Dexter with no choice but to give Debra evidence proving that Hannah killed Price. Debra is on hand to arrest Hannah, as a heartbroken Dexter looks on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Do You See What I See?|episodelink=Dexter (season 7)#ep11|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=December 9, 2012|season=7|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Surprise, Motherfucker!|season finale]], Debra rushes to Dexter's side when LaGuerta has him arrested for the Bay Harbor Butcher murders, and angrily confronts LaGuerta before being told to recuse herself. Dexter is released, however, thanks to the evidence that Debra tampered with. The next day, LaGuerta calls her into her office under the pretext of apologizing &amp;mdash; and confronts her with circumstantial evidence that she was near the church at the time it was destroyed. Debra talks her way out of immediate danger, but fears that LaGuerta will soon have definitive proof of what she and Dexter had done. Later, at Batista's New Year's Eve party, she learns that LaGuerta has gone in pursuit of Dexter, who she fears is in the act of killing Hector Estrada ([[Nestor Serrano]]), the man who ordered his mother's murder. She goes to the scene, where she finds Dexter poised to shoot an unconscious LaGuerta. As she pleads with Dexter not to do it, LaGuerta regains consciousness and urges Debra to kill her brother. Resigned, Dexter tells her to "do what you gotta do". Desperate to save Dexter, Debra shoots and kills LaGuerta, and breaks down in tears over her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Surprise, Motherfucker!|episodelink=Dexter (season 7)#ep12|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=December 16, 2012|season=7|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season eight===
Six months after LaGuerta's death, Debra's life has gone into a tailspin: She has quit her job, started abusing drugs and alcohol, and cut off all contact with Dexter. Now working as a private investigator, she is chasing after &amp;mdash; and sleeping with &amp;mdash; drug dealer Andrew Briggs ([[Rhys Coiro]]). Dexter shows up at her hotel and tells her that an assassin named El Sapo ([[Nick Gomez]]) is coming to kill her and Briggs; Debra responds that she doesn't care. When Briggs tries to scare Dexter off, Dexter kills him, and pleads with Debra to leave with him. Debra refuses, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=A Beautiful Day|episodelink=Dexter (season 8)#ep1|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=June 30, 2013|season=8|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Sapo finds Debra as she searches for Briggs' stolen merchandise and beats her up. In a state of shock, she shoots him dead. When Dexter finds out what Debra has done, she asks him to cover up the crime, which he does.&lt;ref name="Every Silver Lining"/&gt;

Debra is arrested for [[drunk driving]], and calls Quinn to bail her out. Quinn tells Dexter what happened, and Dexter insists on taking Debra to dinner to talk to her. At dinner, he shows Debra footage of her saving a man's life and tells her that she is still a good person. A few days later, Debra walks into Miami Metro, blind drunk, and confesses to Quinn that she killed LaGuerta. Thinking she doesn't know what she's saying, Quinn calls Dexter for help. Dexter arrives with Dr. Evelyn Vogel ([[Charlotte Rampling]]), an old friend of Harry's who knows that Dexter is a serial killer. Just as Debra is about to tell Quinn the truth about LaGuerta's death, Dexter renders her unconscious with the same tranquilizer he uses on his victims, and takes her back to his apartment. There, he asks Vogel to help her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=What's Eating Dexter Morgan?|episodelink=Dexter (season 8)#ep3|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=July 14, 2013|season=8|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vogel tells Debra that she had no other choice but to protect Dexter, and shows her recorded interviews with Harry expressing his guilt over training Dexter to kill; in these interviews, Debra learns the truth about her father's death. She reaches out to Dexter, asking him to take a drive with her so they can talk. Once on the road, Debra seizes the steering wheel and plunges the car into the bay, intent on killing herself and her brother. She is rescued, however, and saves Dexter's life by swimming to the car and pulling him out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Scar Tissue|episodelink=Dexter (season 8)#ep4|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=June 30, 2013|season=8|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debra goes to a resentful Dexter for help when Vogel is kidnapped. While the two of them track Vogel down, Debra tells Dexter that she had saved his life because she couldn't imagine hers without him in it. They find Vogel at the mercy of one of her former patients, serial killer A.J. Yates ([[Aaron McCusker]]); Dexter kills him to protect Debra. Dexter and Debra admit they need each other, and they reconcile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=This Little Piggy|episodelink=Dexter (season 8)#ep5|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=July 28, 2013|season=8|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debra and Dexter are both non-lethally poisoned by Hannah, who has escaped from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=A Little Reflection|episodelink=Dexter (season 8)#ep6|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=August 4, 2013|season=8|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debra demands that Dexter get her out of their lives, and starts surveilling her. When Dexter appears reluctant, Debra goes to her boss Jacob Elway ([[Sean Patrick Flanery]]) and offers to apprehend Hannah for a substantial reward. She tries to capture Hannah, who says the only reason she spared her life was because she didn't want to hurt Dexter. Debra reluctantly drops the case, and even allows Hannah to hide from the police in her apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Are We There Yet?|episodelink=Dexter (season 8)#ep8|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=August 18, 2013|season=8|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debra stops by her old precinct, and Batista offers to reinstate her as a detective. She wants the job, but she knows that she cannot do it while harboring a fugitive and turning a blind eye to Dexter's crimes. To further complicate the situation, she and Quinn, who is now in a relationship with Batista's sister Jamie ([[Aimee Garcia]]), share a kiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Make Your Own Kind of Music|episodelink=Dexter (season 8)#ep9|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=August 25, 2013|season=8|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dexter tells her that he, Hannah and Harrison are going to move to [[Argentina]]. Debra is saddened, but gives him her blessing when she sees how happy he is with his new family. The following day, she takes the job at Miami Metro, and renews her relationship with Quinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Goodbye, Miami|episodelink=Dexter (season 8)#ep10|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=September 8, 2013|season=8|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her first case, Debra helps Dexter catch Oliver Saxon (Darri Ingolfson), a serial killer known as "the Brain Surgeon". Dexter ultimately decides not to kill him, however, and asks her to arrest Saxon. Debra arrives just as Saxon is killing Deputy U.S. Marshall Cooper ([[Kenny Johnson]]), and draws her weapon. Saxon gets the drop on her, however, and shoots her in the abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Monkey in a Box|episodelink=Dexter (season 8)#ep11|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=September 15, 2013|season=8|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the series' final episode, "[[Remember the Monsters?]]", Debra is taken to the hospital, where she tells Quinn she loves him and wishes Dexter a happy life. Moments later, however, she suffers a massive stroke that leaves her in a [[persistent vegetative state]]. After killing Saxon, Dexter goes to see her in the hospital as it is being evacuated in the midst of a hurricane. He tearfully removes her life support, carries her body to his boat, and buries her at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Remember the Monsters?|episodelink=Dexter (season 8)#ep12|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=September 22, 2013|season=8|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic relationships==
Debra is known to have very bad relationships with men. Her first boyfriend on the series is a mechanic named Sean who turns out to be married.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Crocodile|episodelink=Dexter (season 1)#ep2|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=October 8, 2006|season=1|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then has a relationship with Rudy Cooper, who ends up kidnapping her and trying to kill her twice.

In Season two, she starts going out with a man named Gabriel whom she met at the gym, and whom she suspects (incorrectly) of trying to use her notoriety following the Ice Truck Killer case to jumpstart his writing career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Waiting to Exhale|episodelink=Dexter (season 2)#ep2|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=October 7, 2007|season=2|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that ends, she goes out with Frank Lundy, a man 25 years her senior who has to leave Miami at the end of season two, although she resumes her relationship with him in season four. She then starts a relationship with her Confidential Informant Anton Briggs. She breaks up with him to resume her relationship with Lundy, who is murdered. In the season five premiere she sleeps with her partner, [[Joey Quinn]], who tries unsuccessfully to move the relationship into something more than purely sexual. By the end of season 6, she comes to believe that she is in love with her adoptive brother, Dexter &amp;mdash; only to find out that he is a serial killer. In season 7, she has feelings for true crime writer Sal Price, but he is murdered as well.

==Differences from the novels==
In the books, the character's name is spelled "Deborah", and she is described as "voluptuous" in contrast to her slim appearance on the TV show. In the novel ''[[Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]'', Deborah finds out that Dexter is a [[serial killer]], and appears to accept it, although she is sometimes torn between her love for her brother and her duty as a cop. In the TV series, Debra remains unaware of Dexter's "hobby" until the final episode of season six, when she witnesses Dexter killing Travis Marshall.

At the conclusion of ''[[Dexter is Delicious]],'' Deborah is pregnant by her boyfriend, Kyle Chutsky, and in ''[[Double Dexter]]'' we learn that she gave birth to a son, Nicholas, and raises him alone.

In ''[[Dexter's Final Cut]]'', Deborah disowns Dexter after he cheats on Rita and unintentionally allows [[pedophile]] Robert Chase to kill Rita and kidnap Astor. In ''[[Dexter is Dead]]'', Deborah takes custody of Cody, Astor and Dexter's daughter Lily Ann after Dexter is imprisoned for Rita's murder; she knows that Dexter is innocent of that particular crime, but believes that he belongs in prison. After Dexter is freed thanks to his brother Brian's machinations, she refuses to let him see the children and communicates with him only to get him to sign the paperwork to finalize the adoption. However, she is forced to rely on him when Cody, Astor and Nicholas are kidnapped by a Mexican drug lord who is out to get Brian. The three of them team up to infiltrate the drug lord's yacht and rescue the children, and Deborah and Dexter repair their relationship. Deborah saves Dexter's life by killing the drug lord just as he has her wounded brother at his mercy. Moments later, however, Dexter is killed when the yacht explodes; in his final moments, he sees Deborah trying to save him.

==Reception==
Jennifer Carpenter's portrayal of Debra Morgan has received critical praise. Australian journalist [[Jack Marx]] describing her portrayal of "cool and clumsy" Debra as "so perfect that many viewers appear to have mistaken the character's flaws for the actor's."

For her portrayal of the character, she has been nominated for seven [[Saturn Award]]s for [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television|Best Supporting Actress on Television]], in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, winning in 2009 for her performance in season three. She has also been nominated four times as part of the ensemble cast for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]] in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.

'''Ineitha''' '''Lynnette Hardaway''' and '''Herneitha''' '''Rochelle Richardson''', popularly known as '''Diamond and Silk''', are American live-stream video bloggers, social media personalities, and political activists.  They are known for their commentary in support of United States President [[Donald Trump]]. 

The duo received media attention during the 2016 campaign and again in April 2018 when they alleged that [[Facebook]] had notified them they were "unsafe to the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Diamond-and-Silk-Testimony.pdf|title=Diamond and Silk Testimony to House Judiciary Committee|website=Judiciary Committee, US House of Representatives|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, they accused Facebook of blocking and censoring their Facebook page.  There is, however, no evidence that Facebook blocked or censored Diamond and Silk's Facebook page.  On April 23, 2018, [[Steve King|Rep.

==Personal life and history==
Formerly lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]],&lt;ref name="StuartRollingStone" /&gt; they became [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] soon after they saw Trump announce his candidacy on television.  According to Hardaway, "When he announced and we heard everything that he stood for, it was on and poppin’, and we’ve been on the Trump train ever since."&lt;ref name="AtlanticMonthly" /&gt;  They came to wider prominence in 2015 as Trump supporters after posting a video criticizing former [[Fox News]] host [[Megyn Kelly]] for asking what they considered irrelevant questions during the [[Republican Party presidential debates and forums, 2016|first Republican presidential debate]].&lt;ref name="youtube fox business" /&gt;

==Politics and appearances==
[[File:Louie Gohmert with Diamond And Silk.jpg|thumb|right|Diamond and Silk with [[Louie Gohmert]]]]
Although officially unaffiliated with the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]], they urged support for Trump via social media efforts and rallies and traveled to three states for the campaign.&lt;ref name="Newsweek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; The duo first joined Donald Trump as the "[[Stump speech (politics)|Stump]] for Trump Girls" on stage at his [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], rally on December 4, 2015.&lt;ref name="guardian 2015-12" /&gt; They later warmed up the crowd at the Trump rally on January 2, 2016, in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name="americanmirror 2016-01" /&gt;  They initiated a "Ditch and Switch" campaign to encourage Democrats to register as Republicans&lt;ref name="StuartRollingStone"/&gt; and created a website explaining to voters which states had [[Primary elections in the United States#Types of primaries|closed primaries]] and when the deadlines were for changing party affiliations.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

On November 2, 2016, Diamond and Silk appeared with [[Lara Trump]], wife of [[Eric Trump]], in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], on behalf of the Trump campaign.&lt;ref name="journalnow 2016-11" /&gt; They were paid $1,274.94 for field consulting work by the Trump campaign.&lt;ref name="FEC Trump Disbursements" /&gt;

They regularly appear on Fox News shows including ''[[Hannity]]'', ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', ''[[Watters' World]]'', and ''[[The Ingraham Angle]]'', and ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]].''&lt;ref name="NOLA" /&gt; In November 2018, Diamond and Silk were given a show on Fox Nation, which is an online Fox News streaming service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/418306-trump-supporters-diamond-silk-awarded-program-on-new-fox-news-streaming|title=Trump supporters Diamond &amp; Silk awarded program on new Fox News streaming service|last=Swanson|first=Ian|date=2018-11-26|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/diamond-silk-land-weekly-fox-nation-series/|title=Diamond &amp; Silk Get Their Own Weekly Fox Nation Series|date=2018-11-26|work=TheWrap|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were covered on ABC's ''[[Nightline]]''.&lt;ref name="ABC Nightline" /&gt;  Hardaway is notably more talkative, while Richardson often just expresses agreement.&lt;ref name="kansascity" /&gt;

===Racial views===
Following the controversial [[Unite the Right rally]] held in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], on August 11 and 12, 2017, Hardaway and Richardson, appearing on ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'', were critical of protesters on both sides in the event.  Hardaway criticized [[Neo-Nazi]] groups and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] for "spewing hate and&amp;nbsp;... creating violence" declaring "all of them should be condemned and denounced. Period".  In the same interview, she also said she does not "...&amp;nbsp; like [[Black Lives Matter]] and [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa]]."  They further noted that they feel statues of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Confederate States Army|Confederate soldiers]] should be kept in museums.&lt;ref name="FoxNewsInsider" /&gt;

Hardaway and Richardson, in December 2017, expressed support for [[Omarosa Manigault Newman]] following her controversial firing as [[White House]] liaison and assistant, faulting the treatment of her by African Americans and the media generally:  "What I find appalling, to my brothers and sisters [is] how you&amp;nbsp;... can laugh at, pick at, gloat at somebody because they either left the White House or you listened to a salacious story that Miss Piggy went around, running around telling everybody." In the same live-stream, they criticized ''[[Good Morning America]]'' anchor [[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]] for saying, "Bye, Felicia" to Newman during a segment on the ABC show which aired on December 14, 2017.&lt;ref name="BlackStar2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ByeFelicia" /&gt;  Addressing Roberts' remarks, Hardaway said, "How is it that you want the community to come up and then when a sister is sitting at the table, 'Well, she didn’t represent us'? Are you crazy?"&lt;ref name="BlackStar2"/&gt;

===Reception===
Artist and activist [[Bree Newsome]] has described Hardaway and Richardson as "a modern-day minstrel show" and stated in an interview that the pair's presentation relies on "stereotypical images of black women". [[Columbia University]] professor [[Keith Boykin]] argued that if the pair, "the way they speak, the way they talk and act and behave, were saying anything that was contradictory to Trump, the Trump supporters who defend them would be the first to attack them." Boykin argued that conservatives give attention to Hardaway and Richardson because they "only want to listen to the people who reaffirm their narrow, limited vision of what blackness is all about and how black people should perceive white people and specifically how they should perceive Donald Trump."&lt;ref name="nyt newsome boykin"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/14/us/politics/diamond-silk-facebook.html |title=Who Are Diamond and Silk? A Look at 2 Pro-Trump Social Media Stars |last=Stack |first=Liam |date=April 14, 2018 |website=nytimes.com |access-date=August 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===YouTube===
Hardaway and Richardson have asserted that YouTube has discriminated against them through [[Censorship by Google#Advertiser-friendly content|demonetization]] of their channel because of their support for Trump.&lt;ref name="FoxNewsInsider"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Outline" /&gt;

===Facebook===
In an April 2018 [[Twitter|tweet]] and Facebook post, Hardaway and Richardson reproduced a message from Facebook stating that the Diamond and Silk Facebook page's content and brand were deemed to be "unsafe to the community." According to Hardaway and Richardson, the message sent from the Facebook policy team concluded with: "This decision is final and it is not appeal-able in any way."  The pair stated that they believed that they had been victims of censorship by Facebook after receiving a communication from the social media website's policy team. According to Diamond and Silk, they had started questioning Facebook via phone calls, emails, and chat sessions as to their alleged "bias censorship and discrimination against D&amp;S brand page" in September 2017.  Both women have stated a reduction in reactions to their posts and videos since that time period and that followers no longer receive notifications about posts and videos.  As of April 2018, their Facebook page states they have nearly 1.3 million followers.&lt;ref name="Facebookpage" /&gt;

Diamond and Silk's censorship claims were repeated in right-wing media.&lt;ref name="cnn facebook" /&gt; According to CNN, Diamond and Silk's claims likely influenced an April 2018 congressional hearing which involved Mark Zuckerberg after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.&lt;ref name="cnn facebook" /&gt; Business Insider notes that Diamond and Silk were a "frequent topic" during that hearing.&lt;ref name="businessinsider congress" /&gt; [[Tennessee]] Republican [[Marsha Blackburn|Representative Marsha Blackburn]] finished her questioning of Zuckerberg by stating, "Let me tell you something right now, Diamond and Silk is not terrorism". [[Texas]] Republican [[Joe Barton|Representative Joe Barton]] asked Zuckerberg, "Why is Facebook censoring conservative bloggers such as Diamond and Silk?"  Zuckerberg responded that Facebook employees had made an error and they had contacted Hardaway and Richardson.&lt;ref name="CNET" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsweek3" /&gt;

While there is no evidence that Diamond and Silk were censored or that their page was blocked by Facebook, the pair continues to contend it was.&lt;ref name="cnn facebook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn congress hearing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thehill cuomo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost found fame" /&gt; Facebook's own analytics firm showed that the Diamond and Silk page had not lost a significant amount of influence on the social network.&lt;ref name="cnn facebook" /&gt; By the time that Diamond and Silk spoke at a congressional hearing about their censorship claims, news outlets such as [[CNN]] and [[Business Insider]] described their censorship claims as debunked.&lt;ref name="cnn congress hearing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="businessinsider congress" /&gt; At the hearing, experts testified that there was no evidence that Diamond and Silk had been targeted.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost found fame" /&gt; According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "the numbers do not bear out the argument that the sisters have been repressed."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost found fame" /&gt;

Diamond and Silk stated that Facebook had not contacted them. Facebook said they attempted contact via email, Twitter, phone, and Facebook Messenger.&lt;ref name="cnn facebook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="businessinsider congress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thehill cuomo" /&gt;  Diamond and Silk later said that messages sent to them through email should not be expected to be read, because they receive many emails.&lt;ref name="businessinsider congress" /&gt;

=== 2018 Congressional testimony ===
On April 26, 2018, they appeared at a [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] hearing on alleged filtering practices of social media platforms. Representative [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] asked the duo if they had ever received money from the Trump campaign, to which Hardaway responded, "We have never been paid by the Trump campaign." Representative [[Hakeem Jeffries]] suggested that they could be committing perjury and showed them a Federal Election Commission filing which reported that the Trump campaign paid them $1,275 on November 22, 2016 for "field consulting".&lt;ref name=SlateJeffries /&gt;&lt;ref name="thehill congress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews congress" /&gt; 

Diamond and Silk then stated that the payment was reimbursement for the cost of airplane tickets. Following their testimony, the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' reported that, according to Trump campaign treasurer Bradley Crate, the payment had been categorized incorrectly.  Crate stated, "The Campaign’s payment to Diamond and Silk for field consulting was based on an invoice they submitted reflecting their costs for air travel to a Campaign event. The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs." In the same ''Huffington Post'' article, it was reported that following a $7,025 payment from the campaign of [[Paul Ryan]] primary election challenger [[Paul Nehlen]], Hardaway and Richardson endorsed Nehlen.&lt;ref name="huffpo congress" /&gt;

'''Eugenius Aristides Nisbet''' (December 7, 1803 – March 18, 1871) was an American politician, [[jurist]], and lawyer.

==Biography==
[[Image:nisbet.jpg|thumb|175px|US Rep. Eugenius Aristides Nisbet 1803-1871]]

Nisbet was born near [[Union Point, Georgia]]. He attended the Powellton Academy in [[Hancock County, Georgia]] from 1815 to 1817, the [[University of South Carolina]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] from 1817 to 1819, and graduated from the [[University of Georgia]] in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]] with an Bachelor of Arts in 1821. Nisbet then attended the [[Litchfield Law School]] in [[Connecticut]].

After receiving admission in 1824 to the state bar by a special act of the [[Georgia General Assembly]] as he was not yet twenty-one, Nisbet began the practice of law in [[Madison, Georgia]].

Nisbet was elected to the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] in 1827 and served until 1830 when he was elected to the [[Georgia Senate]]. He served in the state senate until 1837. Nisbet unsuccessfully ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1836; however, he was elected to that body in 1838 and again in 1840.

Nisbet resigned from the U.S. House in 1841, due to "the condition of his private affairs and a growing distaste for political life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3186 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Eugenius A. Nisbet (1803-1871)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nisbet was later elected as one of the three initial justices of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] in 1845, and he served as an associate justice on that court until 1853. In 1861, Nisbet was a delegate to the [[Georgia General Assembly#Georgia Secession Convention|Georgia Secession Convention]] and signed the [[Ordinance of Secession]]. He also ran an unsuccessful campaign to become [[Governor of Georgia]] in that same year. Nisbet served as a trustee of UGA from 1864 until his death in 1871 in [[Macon, Georgia]]. He was buried in that city's [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Georgia)|Rose Hill Cemetery]].

'''Florence Barbara Seibert''' (October 6, 1897 – August 23, 1991)&lt;ref name=SSDI&gt;{{cite web|title=Florence B. Seibert|url=http://www.americanancestors.org/PageDetail.aspx?recordId=72206999|work=Social Security Death Index|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[Biochemistry|biochemist]]. She is best known for identifying the active agent in the [[antigen]] [[tuberculin]] as a [[protein]], and subsequently for isolating a pure form of tuberculin, [[purified protein derivative]] (PPD), enabling the development and use of a reliable [[tuberculosis|TB]] test. Seibert has been inducted into the [[Florida Women's Hall of Fame]] and the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].

==Early life and education==
Seibert was born on October 6, 1897, in [[Easton, Pennsylvania]], to George Peter Seibert and Barbara (Memmert) Seibert.&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt; At age three, Florence contracted [[polio]].&lt;ref name=Yost&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yost|first1=Edna|title=American Women of Science|date=1943|publisher=Frederick A. Stokes Company|location=Philadelphia and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had to wear leg braces&lt;ref name="Ogilvie"/&gt; and walked with a limp throughout her life.&lt;ref name=ChemEx/&gt; As a teenager, Seibert is reported to have read biographies of famous scientists which inspired her interest in science.

Seibert did her undergraduate work at [[Goucher College]] in Baltimore,&lt;ref name="Ogilvie"/&gt; graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1918.&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt; She and one of her chemistry teachers, Jessie E. Minor, did war-time work at the Chemistry Laboratory of the Hammersley Paper Mill in Garfield, New Jersey.&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt;

Dr. Seibert earned her [[Ph.D.]] in biochemistry from [[Yale University]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt; At Yale she studied the [[intravenous]] [[medical injection|injection]] of milk [[proteins]] under the direction of [[Lafayette Mendel]].&lt;ref name=APSPapers&gt;{{cite web|title=Florence Barbara Seibert papers, 1920-1977|url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/Mss.B.Se41-ead.xml|website=American Philosophical Society|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She developed a method to prevent these proteins from being contaminated with [[bacteria]]. She was a Van Meter Fellow from 1921 - 1922 and an American Physiological Society Porter Fellow from 1922 - 1923, both at Yale University.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34894324|title=Notable women in the physical sciences : a biographical dictionary|date=1997|publisher=Greenwood Press|others=Shearer, Benjamin F., Shearer, Barbara Smith.|isbn=0313293031|location=Westport, Conn.|oclc=34894324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional achievements and awards==
In 1923 Seibert worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Otho S.A. Sprague Memorial Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spragueinstitute.org/id2.html|title=History|website=www.spragueinstitute.org|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Chicago]]. She was financed by the Porter Fellowship of the [[American Philosophical Society]], an award that was competitive for both men and women. She went on to work part-time at the Ricketts Laboratory at the University of Chicago, and part-time at the Sprague Memorial Institute in Chicago.&lt;ref name=Yount&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yount|first1=Lisa|title=A to Z of women in science and math|date=2008|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=978-0816066957|pages=265–266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=428i2UdWRRAC&amp;pg=PA265|accessdate=26 October 2015}}{{unreliable source?|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, she received the University of Chicago’s Howard Taylor Ricketts Prize for work she began at Yale and continued in Chicago.&lt;ref name=Yount/&gt;  At Yale she reported a curious finding: intravenous injections often caused fever in patients. Dr. Seibert determined that the fevers were caused by toxins produced by the bacteria. The toxins were able to contaminate the distilled water when spray from the boiling water in the distillation flask reached the receiving flask.&lt;ref name=Yount/&gt; Seibert invented a new spray-catching trap to prevent contamination during the distillation process.&lt;ref name="CHF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Esmond R.

It was subsequently adopted by the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[National Institutes of Health]], and various pharmaceutical firms.&lt;ref name=Marker&gt;{{cite web|title=Search Tips advanced search magbottom   Dr. Florence Seibert Historical Marker|url=http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-3A8|website=Explore PA History|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was further recognized in 1962 with the John Elliot Memorial Award from the American Association of Blood Banks for her work on pyrogens.&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt;

Seibert served as an instructor in [[pathology]] from 1924-28 at the University of Chicago and was hired as an assistant professor in biochemistry in 1928. In 1927, her younger sister Mabel moved to Chicago to live and work with her, employed variously as her secretary and her research assistant.&lt;ref name=Gale&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Biography|date=2004|publisher=The Gale Group Inc.|chapter=Florence B. Seibert|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Florence_B._Seibert.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, she met Dr. Esmond R. Long MD PhD, who was working on tuberculosis. 
In 1932 she agreed to relocate, with Long, to the Henry Phipps Institute at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He became professor of pathology and director of laboratories at the Phipps Institute, while she accepted a position as an assistant professor in biochemistry. Their goal was the development of a reliable test for the identification of tuberculosis.  The previous tuberculin derivative, [[Robert Koch|Koch's]] substance, had produced false negative results in tuberculosis tests since the 1890s because of impurities in the material.&lt;ref name=CHF/&gt;

With Long's supervision and funding, Seibert identified the active agent in tuberculin as a protein. Seibert spent a number of years developing methods for separating and purifying the protein from ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'', obtaining [[purified protein derivative]] (PPD) and enabling the creation of a reliable test for tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="CHF"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dacso/&gt;

Her first publication on the purification of tuberculin appeared in 1934.&lt;ref name=ChemEx&gt;{{cite web|title=Florence Seibert, American Biochemist, 1897–1991|url=http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ru-Sp/Seibert-Florence.html|website=Chemistry Explained|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some sources credit her with successfully isolating the tuberculosis protein molecule during 1937–38,&lt;ref name=Windsor&gt;{{cite book|last1=Windsor|first1=Laura Lynn|title=Women in medicine : an encyclopedia|date=2002|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1576073926|pages=184–185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtZtkf35CF0C&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she visited the [[Uppsala University|University of Uppsala]], [[Sweden]], as a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim fellow]] to work with Nobel-prize winning protein scientist [[Theodor Svedberg]].&lt;ref name=Ogilvie&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ogilvie|first1=Marilyn|last2=Harvey|first2=Joy|title=The biographical dictionary of women in science|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92038-8|page=1173|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LTSYePZvSXYC&amp;pg=PA1173|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She developed methods for purifying a [[crystal]]line tuberculin derivative using filters of porous clay and nitric-acid treated cotton.&lt;ref name=CHF/&gt; In 1938, she was awarded the Trudeau Medal of the National Tuberculosis Association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 1940s, Seibert's purified protein derivative (PPD) became a national&lt;ref name=Marker/&gt; and international standard for tuberculin tests.&lt;ref name=Dacso&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dacso|first1=C.

In 1943, Seibert received the first Achievement Award from the [[American Association of University Women]].

She remained at the Henry Phipps Institute at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1932 to 1959. She was an assistant professor from 1932-1937, an associate professor from 1937-1955, a full professor of biochemistry from 1955-1959, and professor emeritus as of her official retirement in 1959.&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt;

She and her sister Mabel then moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, where Florence  continued to research the possible relationships between bacteria and types of cancers, working with Mound Park Hospital&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt; and with the Bay Pines V.A. Research Center.&lt;ref name="Marker"/&gt; She continued to publish scientific papers until 1977.

'''Francis O'Kelly''' (28 December 1938 – 28 February 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12176759/Frank-Kelly-actor-obituary.html|title=Frank Kelly, actor - obituary|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known by his stage name of '''Frank Kelly''', was an [[Irish people|Irish]] actor, singer and writer, whose career covered television, radio, theatre, music, screenwriting and film. He played [[Father Jack Hackett]] in the [[Channel Four]] sitcom ''[[Father Ted]]'', and was also the son of the cartoonist [[Charles E. Kelly (cartoonist)|Charles E. Kelly]].

==Early life and career==
Kelly was born, in 1938, in [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], south [[County Dublin]], where he lived most of his life. His parents were Cathleen and [[Charles E. Kelly (cartoonist)|Charles E. Kelly]], cartoonist and founder of the satirical magazine ''Dublin Opinion''. He studied law and tried journalism,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/28/frank-kelly-father-ted-foul-mouthed-priest-father-jack-dies|title=Frank Kelly, Father Ted's foul-mouthed priest, dies aged 77|first=Hannah|last=Ellis-Petersen|date=28 February 2016|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=23 April 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving on to acting. He worked at Dublin’s [[Eblana Theatre]] with [[Cecil Sheridan]] and as a feed to [[Jack Cruise|Cruise]]. Other work included [[pantomime]] and reviews.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Late Frank Kelly was loved by generations of Irish people|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/late-frank-kelly-was-loved-by-generations-of-irish-people-1.2552681|accessdate=29 February 2016|work=The Irish Times|date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly's first film role was as an uncredited prison officer in ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969), escorting Charlie Croker ([[Michael Caine]]) out of prison&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; in the film's opening sequence.

He starred in the popular [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] children's programme ''[[Wanderly Wagon]]'' alongside [[Eugene Lambert]] and Nora O'Mahoney from 1968 to 1982, playing a number of different characters and writing many of the scripts.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt; It was Kelly's work on ''[[Hall's Pictorial Weekly]]'' (1970–1982) that established him as one of Ireland's most recognisable faces. He memorably portrayed councillor Parnell Mooney, a send-up of a backwards local authority figure in rural Ireland. In 1974, Kelly won a [[Jacob's Award]] for his work on the series.

In the early 1980s, he was featured in the RTÉ TV programme for those learning Irish ''[[Anois is Aris]]''. At the end of the programme he spoke into a telephone, gradually introducing Irish phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED232437&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED232437|title=Learning Irish with "Anois is Aris." CLCS Occasional Paper No. 6, Winter 1982-3. A Report on the Background, Attitudes, Expectations, and Learning Experience of a Volunteer Group of Course Participants.|first=Devitt, S. M. |last=And Others|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he appeared in the Irish thriller film ''[[Taffin]]''.

==''Father Ted''==
Kelly was best known outside Ireland for playing [[Father Jack Hackett]] in the comedy series ''[[Father Ted]]'', which aired in the United Kingdom from April 1995 to May 1998. Father Jack is an old and offensively rambunctious priest who usually shouts only "[[feck]]!", "arse!", "drink!" and "girls!" and the occasional scream of "what!" and "women's knickers".

For his role in ''Father Ted'', he wore [[contact lens]]es (to show Father Jack's blank eye). People would not eat lunch with him during filming if he was in his Father Jack make-up&lt;ref name="scripts"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linehan|first1=Graham|last2=Mathews|first2=Arthur|title=Father Ted: the complete scripts|year=1999|page=120|publisher=Boxtree|location=London|isbn=0752218506}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the false flaky skin he was wearing would fall off into the food.

Interviewing Kelly in 1997 for ''[[The Irish Times]]'', Deirdre Falvey said of him: "In person he could not be further from Father Jack. Urbane, articulate, thoughtful, fit (he swims and hikes), charming company, full of stories, and quite serious, though his conversation is punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter—he is reputably a great slagger with colleagues, and is very well liked." Kelly himself said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I like humour — but I'm very suspicious of people who laugh all the time, because they never listen to what you're saying, they always — have another agenda and they generally have no sense of humour. The most untrustworthy body language I know is that of the person who laughs all the time. That terrifies me. People with no sense or a very limited sense of humour I am very wary of too, because it's not a sign of great intelligence to be without a sense of humour. If you've no sense of irony you haven't a great decision making capacity because you must see the possibilities of the downside of any decision. Without perspective you can't have any wisdom, so it frightens me when I meet captains of industry or whatever who have virtually no sense of humour. That's the kind of person I find dismaying.&lt;ref name=falvey&gt;{{cite web|author=Deirdre Falvey |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/jack-of-all-trades-1.28072 |title=JACK of all trades |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=1 February 1997 |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later career==
From 1999 to 2001, Kelly starred in ''[[Glenroe]]'' as Maurice and played Henry Doyle (father of [[Pierce Brosnan]]'s Desmond Doyle) in ''[[Evelyn (film)|Evelyn]]'' (2002). He appeared in the film ''Rat'' in 2000, as a priest called Father Pickle in the TV series ''[[Lexx]]'' (2001), and also in a short film, ''[[Yu Ming Is Ainm Dom]]'', in 2003. That same year, he had a major role as [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], leader of the Labour Party, in the UK Television drama ''[[The Deal (2003 film)|The Deal]]''.

In 2007, he acted in the [[TG4]] political drama ''Running Mate'', about an election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/whoswho/Producers/whoswhosub/filmproducers/?act1=record&amp;only=1&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4279794&amp;tpl=archnews&amp;force=|title=1 October Start For TG4's ‘Running Mate'|publisher=IFTN|date=25 Sep 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the TG4 series ''Paddywhackery''.

On 29 September 2010, it was announced that Kelly had joined [[ITV1]] soap ''[[Emmerdale]]'', playing the role of Dermot, [[Declan Macey]]'s father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a279434/emmerdale-reveals-new-home-farm-dynasty.html|title='Emmerdale' reveals new Home Farm dynasty|publisher=Digital Spy|date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly left the soap after five months of filming because he missed his family in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primetime.unrealitytv.co.uk/father-teds-frank-kelly-has-quit-emmerdale/|title=Father Ted's Frank Kelly has quit Emmerdale|publisher=Unreality TV|date=30 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504164148/http://primetime.unrealitytv.co.uk/father-teds-frank-kelly-has-quit-emmerdale/|archivedate=4 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A regular stage actor, Kelly toured extensively in the United States and Canada. He provided [[voice-overs]] and in his television advertising work, appeared with "Mr Tayto" in an advertising campaign for [[Tayto (Republic of Ireland)|Tayto]] crisps.

In 2014, he appeared as judge Justice Cannon in ''[[Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirsty Blake |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/its-back-to-the-parochial-house-for-ted-star-kelly-30140430.html |title=It's back to the parochial house for 'Ted' star Kelly |publisher=Independent.ie |date=31 March 2014 |accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Kelly published an autobiography called ''The Next Gig''. His reminiscences include those of acting colleagues including [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Michael Caine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currach.ie/index.php/the-next-gig.html|title=The Next Gig|publisher=currach.ie|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio comedy==
Many of his radio sketches originated from his weekday [[RTÉ Radio 1|RTÉ]] radio show ''The Glen Abbey Show'' in the 1970s until the 1990s. Kelly played the part of a [[culchie]], "Gobnait O'Lúnasa", the sketches typically started with the sound of him putting coins in an old freckle coin box, and when the phone rang and was answered, his words were, "Hello! Guess who? Is that you Nuala?" Kelly acted the part of an English [[BBC]] reporter interviewing rural inhabitants about local customs, such as watching bacon being sliced, or "ha-hooing" (shouting a [[Rebel yell]]) competitions. The village was called Ballykilferret and described by the BBC man as being in "the Republic of Eer-ah" (a mispronunciation of [[Éire]]).

==Music career==
In 1982, Kelly released a single, "Christmas Countdown", a [[Novelty song|comedy monologue]]  based on the Christmas song "[[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]" and credited to the  pseudonymic Gobnait O’Lúnasa. It reached number eight in the [[Irish Singles Chart]] in 1982, and peaked at #26 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1984. He performed the single live on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on 5 January of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=11272 |title=Frank Kelly – Christmas Countdown |publisher=Chart Stats |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplyeighties.com/frank-kelly---christmas-countdown.php#.WTxw2fnyvct]&lt;/ref&gt; The single was the opening track on the later album ''Comedy Countdown''.

In 2000 he released ''Comedy Countdown'', an album featuring some of his sketches taken from ''The Glen Abbey Show''. Tracks included the "Ayatollah Ceili Band" (a pun on [[The Tulla Céilí Band]]), "Magnum Farce", "Incoming Call", "Festive Spirit", "Hymn of Praise", "Call of the Wild", "Festive Note" and "Siege Mentality".

==Death==
Kelly died on 28 February 2016, after suffering a heart attack. He revealed he had [[Parkinson's disease]] in October 2015, and was recovering from [[Colorectal cancer|bowel cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-35682191 |title='Father Jack' actor Kelly dies aged 77 |publisher=BBC News |date=28 February 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously survived [[skin cancer]].&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/frank-kelly-rip-father-jack-2630816-Feb2016/ |title=Beloved actor Frank Kelly has died aged 77 |publisher=Thejournal.ie |date=28 February 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His death came exactly 18 years after the death of his ''Father Ted'' co-star [[Dermot Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1650208/father-jack-actor-frank-kelly-dies-aged-77 |title=Father Jack Actor Frank Kelly Dies Aged 77 |publisher=News.sky.com |date=28 February 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228190342/http://news.sky.com/story/1650208/father-jack-actor-frank-kelly-dies-aged-77 |archivedate=28 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/news/2016/0228/771346-acting-great-frank-kelly-dies-aged-77/ |title=Acting great Frank Kelly dies aged 77 - RTÉ Ten |publisher=Rte.ie |date= |accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at Kelly's funeral, [[Michael D. Higgins]], the President of Ireland, said, "He will forever be remembered for his roles in the theatre and will be recalled with great affection and fondness for his roles on television, including in ''Wanderly Wagon'', ''Glenroe'' and the much-loved ''Hall's Pictorial Weekly''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/actor-frank-kelly-s-funeral-underway-in-dublin-1.2556657|title=Actor Frank Kelly’s funeral underway in Dublin|website=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly was survived by Bairbre, his wife of 51 years who was a drama teacher, and by their five daughters, two sons and 17 grandchildren.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;

'''Frank Musselman Schoonmaker''' (August 20, 1905 – January 11, 1976) was an American [[travel guide]] writer, wine writer and wine [[merchant]]. He was born in [[Spearfish, South Dakota]], and attended two years at [[Princeton University]], after which he dropped out of in 1925 to live and travel in Europe. He wrote two travel guides, ''Through Europe on Two Dollars a Day'' and ''Come with me to France'', and, with the approaching end of [[Prohibition in the United States]], researched and wrote a series of articles for ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 616 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While involved in this latter project he met [[Raymond Baudoin]], the editor of the ''[[La Revue du vin de France]]'', who took him under his wing and taught him about wine, touring the various [[French wine|wine regions of France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McCoy | first = Elin | title = The Emperor of Wine: the Rise of Robert M. Parker, Jr. and the Rein of American Taste | location = New York | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-06-009369-2 | pages = 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schoonmaker also collaborated in the wine trade with [[Alexis Lichine]], another wine writer, and the pair was considered the two most influential wine writers in the US for several decades.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; In January 1976, Frank Schoonmaker died at his home at 50 East 72nd Street in New York City.

==Army service==
In 1939 Schoonmaker joined a new division of the [[U.S. Army]] known as the [[Office of Strategic Services]] or O.S.S, where he was stationed in Spain. He received the Bronze Star for his work with the O.S.S. After the war, Alexis Lichine negotiated a full partnership with Schoonmaker, but the wine partnership ended bitterly. In 1946, after many months of trying to find a compromise that would work for both, Lichine went to work as the import-export manager for [[United Distillers of America]].

==Wine writings and marketing==
Schoonmaker's importance was both as a writer, the author of the ''Complete Wine Book'' (1934) and later the classic ''Frank Schoonmaker's Encyclopedia of Wine'', and as a wine importer, who found American markets especially for small scale growers in [[Burgundy (wine)|Burgundy]]&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; such as [[Domaine Ponsot]] in [[Morey St Denis]] and the [[Marquis d'Angerville]] in [[Volnay (wine)|Volnay]]. Together with Baudoin, Schoonmaker played a seminal role in creating a market for wines bottled by the grower/winemaker rather than by a ''[[negotiant]]''' – a merchant/shipper.  He started "Frank Schoonmaker Selections" in 1936 in New York City.

In 1972 The 'Frank Schoonmaker Selections' company was purchased by a division of the [[Souverain]] wine conglomerate. It was owned by [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. In 1974 the Souverain wineries and the Frank Schoonmaker Import wine business were sold to [[St. Helena (wine)|St. Helena]]'s [[Freemark Abbey]] wine group, and was renamed [[Rutherford Hill Winery]]. The same year a group of 179 grape growers bought the [[Alexander Valley (wine)|Alexander Valley]] Souverain facility. It has since become the property of [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. The Frank Schoonmaker Selections division was [[liquidated]] in 1975.

==Consulting work==
As a consultant to such Californian wineries as [[Wente Vineyards|Wente]] and [[Almaden Vineyards|Almaden]], Schoonmaker introduced the idea of labeling wines using [[varietal]] names (such as [[Pinot noir]], [[Chardonnay]], or [[Riesling]]) rather than [[semi-generic]] names borrowed from European regions ("Burgundy", "Chablis", "Rhine", etc.).&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; Schoonmaker claimed that [[Terroir|"the more specific the name, the better the wine"]]. While Schoonmaker was promoting the practice in California already around 1940, it did not become truly widespread until the late 1960s and early 1970s. [[Robert Mondavi]] was one of the first to label the majority of his wines by varietal names and was tireless in promoting the practice. This has become the standard in [[New World wine]] and some European producers are adopting the practice because of consumer demand.

'''George Ayittey''' (born 13 October 1945) is a [[Ghana]]ian economist, author and president of the [[Free Africa Foundation]] in [[Washington DC]]. He is a professor at [[American University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/cas/econ/faculty/ayittey.htm Faculty page at American University]&lt;/ref&gt; and an associate scholar at the [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]].&lt;ref name=FPRI&gt;[http://www.fpri.org/about/people/ayittey.html Bio at Foreign Policy Research Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407195017/http://www.fpri.org/about/people/ayittey.html |date=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has championed the argument that "Africa is poor because she is not free", that the primary cause of African poverty is less a result of the oppression and mismanagement by [[colonialism|colonial powers]], but rather a result of modern oppressive native autocrats and [[socialism|socialist]] [[central planning]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;"Africa’s crisis is of modern socialist making and stems from the misrule, mismanagement and corruption of the elite." "[https://fee.org/resources/betrayal-why-socialism-failed-in-africa/ Betrayal: Why Socialism Failed in Africa]," adapted from a speech Ayittey delivered at "Evenings at FEE" in April 2005; accessed 01 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He also goes beyond criticism of the ''status quo'' to advocate for specific ways to address the abuses of the past and present; specifically he calls for [[Democracy|democratic government]], debt reexamination, modernized infrastructure, [[Free-market economics|free market economics]], and [[free trade]] to promote development.

==Life==
Ayittey holds a B.Sc. in Economics from the [[University of Ghana]], [[Legon]], an M.A. from the [[University of Western Ontario]] in [[Canada]], and a Ph.D. from the [[University of Manitoba]]. He has taught at [[Wayne State College]] and [[Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania]]. He held a National Fellowship at the [[Hoover Institution]] in 1988–89, and then joined [[The Heritage Foundation]] as a Bradley Resident Scholar.&lt;ref name=FPRI/&gt; He founded The Free Africa Foundation in 1993, to serve as a catalyst for reform in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freeafrica.org/|title=Free Africa Foundation|website=www.freeafrica.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Dr. Ayittey was listed by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' as one of the "[[Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll|Top 100 Public Intellectuals]]" who "are shaping the tenor of our time".&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4314#bios Top 100 Public Intellectuals], ''Foreign Policy''&lt;/ref&gt; He lives in [[Lorton, Virginia]].

==Political views==
Ayittey believes there are three keys to successfully rescuing Africa from oppressive despotism:
* First, he advocates forming coalitions consisting of small groups of "elders" who have no political ties and  monitor the activities of the various opposition groups. Ayittey explains "They must be able to reach out to all the opposition groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=mariam |first=al |title=Ayittey's War on African Dictators |url=http://open.salon.com/blog/almariam/2011/06/12/george_ayitteys_war_on_african_dictatorships |work=Online article |publisher=huffingpost |accessdate=2011-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903172333/http://open.salon.com/blog/almariam/2011/06/12/george_ayitteys_war_on_african_dictatorships |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The council should bring all of the opposition into an alliance ", which would prevent dictators from overpowering severely divided competition.
* Second, nations have to gain control of the civil service, security forces, judiciary, election centers, and national bank. Ayittey sees control of at least one of these resources as central to subverting dictatorial power in African countries. These organizations are currently staffed by cronies of dictators throughout Africa.
* Third, and finally, a nation has to use the correct sequence of reforms.

[[File:Germanic limes.jpg|thumb|Roman limes and modern boundaries.]]
The German term ''[[:wikt:Deutsche|Deutsche]]'' originates from the [[Old High German]] word ''[[diutisc]]'' (from ''diot'' "people"), referring to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] "language of the people". It is not clear how commonly, if at all, the word was used as an ethnonym in Old High German.

Used as a noun, ''ein diutscher'' in the sense of "a German" emerges in [[Middle High German]], attested from the second half of the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]. See [[Matthias von Lexer|Lexer]], ''Mittelhochdeutsches Handwörterbuch'' (1872–1878), s.v. "Diutsche".
The Middle High German [[Song of Roland]] (ca. 1170) has  ''in diutisker erde'' (65.6) for "in the German realm, in Germany".
The phrase ''in tütschem land'', whence the modern ''[[Deutschland]]'', is attested in the late 15th century (e.g. [[Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg]], [[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]], see Grimm, ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'', s.v. "Deutsch").&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old French]] term ''alemans'' is taken from the name of the [[Alamanni]]. It was loaned into [[Middle English]] as ''almains'' in the early 14th century. The word ''Dutch'' is attested in English from the 14th century, denoting continental West Germanic ("Dutch" and "German") dialects and their speakers.&lt;ref&gt;''OED'', s.v. [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/58711?rskey=gu9Opa] "Dutch, adj., n., and adv."&lt;/ref&gt;

While in most [[Romance languages]] the Germans have been named from the Alamanni (in what became [[Swabia]]) (some, like standard [[Italian language|Italian]] ''tedeschi'', retain an older borrowing of the [[exonym and endonym|endonym]], while the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] 'germani' stems from the historical correlation with the ancient region of [[Germania]]), the [[Old Norse]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] names for the Germans were taken from that of the [[Saxons]]. In [[Slavic languages]], the Germans were given the name of   ''{{lang|sla|němьci}} '' (singular ''{{lang|sla|němьcь}}''), originally with a meaning "foreigner, one who does not speak [Slavic]".

The English term ''Germans'' is only attested from the mid-16th century, based on the classical Latin term ''Germani'' used by [[Julius Caesar]] and later [[Tacitus]]. It gradually replaced ''Dutch'' and ''Almains'', the latter becoming mostly obsolete by the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schulze |first=Hagen |authorlink=Hagen Schulze |title=Germany: A New History |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=4 |year=1998 |isbn= 0-674-80688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t27.e6407 "German"], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology''.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Germany|Germanic peoples|Theodiscus}}
The Germans are a Germanic people, who as an ethnicity emerged during the Middle Ages. Originally part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], around 300 independent German states emerged during its decline after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 ending the [[Thirty Years War]]. These states eventually formed into [[German Empire|modern Germany]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Origins===
[[File:West Germanic Kingdoms 460.jpg|thumb|right|Germanic Kingdoms in Europe c. 500 AD]]

The concept of a German ethnicity is linked to Germanic tribes of antiquity in central Europe.&lt;ref name="Its Peoples 2009. Pp. 311"&gt;World and Its Peoples. Marshall Cavendish, 2009. Pp. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Germans originated on the [[North German Plain]] as well as southern Scandinavia.&lt;ref name="Its Peoples 2009. Pp. 311"/&gt; By the 2nd century BC, the number of Germans{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} was significantly increasing and they began expanding into eastern Europe and southward into Celtic territory.&lt;ref name="Its Peoples 2009. Pp. 311"/&gt; During antiquity these Germanic tribes remained separate from each other and did not have writing systems at that time.&lt;ref name="Yehuda Cohen 2010. Pp. 27"&gt;Yehuda Cohen. The Germans: Absent Nationality and the Holocaust. SUSSEX ACADEMIC PRESS, 2010. Pp. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Iron Age]] the area that is now Germany was divided into the ([[Celts|Celtic]]) [[La Tène culture|La Tène horizon]] in [[Southern Germany]] and the ([[Germanic peoples|Germanic]]) [[Jastorf culture]] in [[Northern Germany]]. By 55 BC, the Germans{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} had reached the Danube river and had either assimilated or otherwise driven out the Celts who had lived there, and had spread west into what is now Belgium and France.&lt;ref name="Yehuda Cohen 2010. Pp. 27"/&gt;

Conflict between the Germanic tribes and the forces of [[ancient Rome|Rome]] under [[Julius Caesar]] forced major Germanic tribes to retreat to the east bank of the [[Rhine]].&lt;ref name="Its Peoples 2009. Pp. 311-312"&gt;World and Its Peoples. Marshall Cavendish, 2009. Pp. 311–312.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman emperor [[Augustus]] in 12 BC ordered the conquest of the Germans{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}, but the catastrophic Roman defeat at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] resulted in the Roman Empire abandoning its plans to completely conquer [[Germania]].&lt;ref name="Its Peoples 2009. Pp. 311"/&gt; Germanic peoples in Roman territory were culturally Romanized, and although much of Germania remained free of direct Roman rule, Rome deeply influenced the development of German society, especially the adoption of Christianity by the Germans who obtained it from the Romans.&lt;ref name="Its Peoples 2009. Pp. 311-312"/&gt; In Roman-held territories with Germanic populations, the Germanic and Roman peoples intermarried, and Roman, Germanic, and Christian traditions intermingled.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret Jacob, James R. Jacob, Theodore H. Von Laue. ''Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society, Volume I: To 1789''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009. Pp. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of Christianity would later become a major influence in the development of a common German identity.&lt;ref name="Yehuda Cohen 2010. Pp. 27"/&gt;

The first major public figure to speak of a German{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} people in general, was the Roman figure [[Tacitus]] in his work ''Germania'' around 100 AD.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey E. Cole 2011. Pp. 172"&gt;Jeffrey E. Cole. Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2011. Pp. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; However an actual united German identity and ethnicity did not exist then, and it would take centuries of development of German culture until the concept of a German ethnicity began to become a popular identity.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=189}}

The Germanic peoples during the [[Migration Period|Migrations Period]] came into contact with other peoples; in the case of the populations settling in the territory of modern Germany, they encountered [[Celts]] to the south, and [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] towards the east. The ''[[Limes Germanicus]]'' was breached in AD 260. Migrating Germanic tribes commingled with the local [[Gallo-Roman]] populations in what is now [[Swabia]] and [[Bavaria]]. The arrival of the [[Huns]] in Europe resulted in Hun conquest of large parts of Eastern Europe, the Huns initially were allies of the Roman Empire who fought against Germanic tribes, but later the Huns cooperated with the Germanic tribe of the Ostrogoths, and large numbers of Germans lived within the lands of the [[Huns#Unified Empire under Attila|Hunnic Empire]] of [[Attila]].&lt;ref name="Ostrogoths Pp. 46"&gt;A History of the Ostrogoths. Pp. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Attila had both Hunnic and Germanic families and prominent Germanic chiefs amongst his close entourage in Europe.&lt;ref name="Ostrogoths Pp. 46"/&gt; The Huns living in Germanic territories in Eastern Europe adopted an [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic language]] as their ''[[lingua franca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sinor, Denis. 1990. The Hun period. In D. Sinor, ed., The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia.

Pavlac. A Concise Survey of Western Civilization: Supremacies and Diversities Throughout History. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2010. Pp. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The migration-period peoples who later coalesced into a "German" ethnicity were the Germanic tribes of the [[Saxons]], [[Franks|Franci]], [[Thuringii]], [[Alamanni]] and [[Bavarii]]. These five tribes, sometimes with inclusion of the [[Frisians]], are considered as the major groups to take part in the formation of the Germans.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} By the 9th century, the large tribes which lived on the territory of modern Germany had been united under the rule of the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]], known in German as Karl der Große.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa20|title=HISTORY OF CHARLEMAGNE|website=Historyworld.net|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/4892-charlemagne-changed-world.html|title=How Charlemagne Changed the World|work=LiveScience.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegelgeschichte/wie-karl-der-grosse-aachen-zur-kaiserlichen-metropole-ausbaute-a-872076.html|title=Wie Karl der Große Aachen zur kaiserlichen Metropole ausbaute|author=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany|date=26 November 2012|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwanitz |first=Dietrich |title=Bildung.

[[File:HRR 10Jh.jpg|thumb|upright|Extent of [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 972 (red line) and 1035 (red dots) with [[Kingdom of Germany]] marked in blue]]

A German ethnicity emerged in the course of the [[Middle Ages]], ultimately as a result of the formation of the [[Kingdom of Germany]] within [[East Francia]] and later the [[Holy Roman Empire]], beginning in the 9th century. The process was gradual and lacked any clear definition, and the use of exonyms designating "the Germans" develops only during the [[High Middle Ages]]. The title of ''rex teutonicum'' "[[King of the Germans]]" is first used in the late 11th century, by the chancery of [[Pope Gregory VII]], to describe the future Holy Roman Emperor of the German nation [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B84ZaAdGbS4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=rex+teutonicorum+Pope+Gregory+VII&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=srK_BlsK-U&amp;sig=FVtYWnojL0clzzxAioudhrwVBEE&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_Sc-UYDhGczV4QSnyYHYBA&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=rex%20teutonicorum%20Pope%20Gregory%20VII&amp;f=false|title=Germany|page=18|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natively, the term ''diutscher'' (German) was used for the people of Germany beginning in the 12th century.

After [[Christianization of the Germanic peoples|Christianization]], the Roman Catholic Church and local rulers led German expansion and settlement in areas inhabited by Slavs and Balts, known as [[Ostsiedlung]]. During the wars waged in the Baltic by the Catholic German [[Teutonic Knights]]; the lands inhabited by the ethnic group of the [[Old Prussians]] (the current reference to the people known then simply as the "Prussians"), were conquered by the Germans. The Old Prussians were an ethnic group related to the [[Latvians|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] Baltic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Ammon, Norbert Dittmar, Klaus J. Mattheier. ''Soziolinguistik: Ein Internationales Handbuch Zur Wissenschaft Von Sprache und Gesellschaft''. English translation edition. Walter de Gruyter, 2006. Pp. 1866.&lt;/ref&gt; The former German state of [[Prussia]] took its name from the Baltic Prussians, although it was led by Germans who had assimilated the Old Prussians; the old Prussian language was extinct by the 17th or early 18th century.&lt;ref name="Lang extinct"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica entry 'Old Prussian language'&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Slavs|Slavic]] people of the Teutonic-controlled Baltic were assimilated into German culture and eventually there were many intermarriages of Slavic and German families, including into Prussia's aristocracy known as the [[Junker]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1914"&gt;G. J. Meyer. ''A World Undone: The Story of the Great War 1914 to 1918''. Random House Digital, Inc., 2007. Pp. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Prussian military strategist [[Karl von Clausewitz]] is a famous German whose surname is of Slavic origin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1914"/&gt; Massive German settlement led to the assimilation of Baltic ([[Old Prussians]]) and Slavic ([[Wends]]) populations, who were exhausted by previous warfare.

At the same time, naval innovations led to a German domination of trade in the [[Baltic Sea]] and parts of Eastern Europe through the [[Hanseatic League]]. Along the trade routes, Hanseatic trade stations became centers of the German culture. [[German town law]] ''(Stadtrecht)'' was promoted by the presence of large, relatively wealthy German populations, their influence and political power. Thus people who would be considered "Germans", with a common culture, language, and [[worldview]] different from that of the surrounding rural peoples, colonized trading towns as far north of present-day Germany as [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] (in [[Norway]]), [[Stockholm]] (in [[Sweden]]), and [[Vyborg]] (now in Russia). The Hanseatic League was not exclusively German in any ethnic sense: many towns who joined the league were outside the Holy Roman Empire and a number of them may only loosely be characterized as ''German''. The Empire itself was not entirely German either. It had a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual structure, some of the smaller ethnicities and languages used at different times were Dutch, Italian, French, Czech and Polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/ausstellungen/heiliges-roemisches-reich/index_3.html|title=Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation|website=Dhm.de|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Middle Ages]], large numbers of [[Jews]] lived in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and had assimilated into German culture, including many Jews who had previously assimilated into French culture and had spoken a mixed Judeo-French language.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Ammon 2006"&gt;Ulrich Ammon, Norbert Dittmar, Klaus J. Mattheier. ''Soziolinguistik: Ein Internationales Handbuch Zur Wissenschaft Von Sprache und Gesellschaft''. English translation edition. Walter de Gruyter, 2006. Pp. 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon assimilating into German culture, the Jewish German peoples incorporated major parts of the German language and elements of other European languages into a mixed language known as [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref name="Ulrich Ammon 2006"/&gt; However tolerance and assimilation of Jews in German society suddenly ended during the [[Crusades]] with many Jews being forcefully expelled from Germany and Western Yiddish disappeared as a language in Germany over the centuries, with German Jewish people fully adopting the German language.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Ammon 2006"/&gt;

===Early Modern period===
[[File:Holy Roman Empire 1648.svg|thumb|left|The [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]

From the late 15th century, the Holy Roman Empire came to be known as the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German nation]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]], a series of conflicts fought mainly in the territory of modern Germany, weakened the coherence of the Holy Roman Empire, leading to the emergence of different, smaller German states known as ''[[Kleinstaaterei]]'' in [[18th-century Germany]].

The [[Napoleonic Wars]] were the cause of the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and ultimately the cause for the quest for a German [[nation state]] in 19th-century [[German nationalism]]. After the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Prussia]] emerged as two competitors. Austria, trying to remain the dominant power in Central Europe, led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna. The Congress of Vienna was essentially conservative, assuring that little would change in Europe and preventing Germany from uniting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colby.edu/personal/r/rmscheck/GermanyA3.html|title=Raffael Scheck's Web Page » Raffael Scheck's Home Page|website=Colby.edu|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms came to a sudden halt following the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolutions of 1848]] and the [[Crimean War]] in 1856, paving the way for [[German unification]] in the 1860s. By the 1820s, large numbers of Jewish German women had intermarried with Christian German men and had converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Sadie Hertz.

German nationalism became the sole focus of the [[German Question]] which was the question of how Germany was going to be best unified into a nation-state. The idea of unifying all German-speakers into one state was known as the Großdeutsche Lösung ("Greater German solution") which was propagated mostly by the Austrian Empire and the German Austrians. The other option, the Kleindeutsche Lösung ("Lesser German solution") only advocated unifying the northern German states without Austria and the German Austrians was supported predominantly in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite book|author=Dirk Verheyen|title=The German Question: A Cultural, Historical, and Geopolitical Exploration|date=30 July 1999|publisher=Avalon Publishing|isbn=978-0-8133-6878-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of including the Austrian Empire into a German nation-state was a problem because it included many non-German ethnic groups, as well as many of the areas it ruled had never been part of Germany and did not want to become part of a German nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Imanuel Geiss|title=The Question of German Unification: 1806-1996|date=16 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-18568-7|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, the [[Austro-Prussian War|feud between Austria and Prussia]] finally came to a head. In the final battle of the German war (''[[Battle of Königgrätz]]'') the Prussians successfully defeated the Austrians and succeeded in creating the [[North German Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/sierra/sevenweeks1866.htm |title=Austria-Hungary Prussia War 1866 |publisher=Onwar.com |date=16 December 2000 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, after France attacked Prussia, Prussia and its new allies in Southern Germany (among them Bavaria) were victorious in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. It created the [[German Empire]] in 1871 as a German [[nation-state]], effectively excluding the multi-ethnic Austrian [[Habsburg monarchy]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. Integrating the Austrian Germans nevertheless remained a strong desire for many people of Germany and Austria, especially among the liberals, the social democrats and also the Catholics who were a minority within the Protestant Germany.

During the 19th century in the German territories, rapid population growth due to lower death rates, combined with poverty, spurred millions of Germans to emigrate, chiefly to the United States. Today, roughly 17% of the United States' population (23% of the [[White American|white]] population) is of mainly German ancestry.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau, German ancestry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;-format=|title=American FactFinder - Search|website=Factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Census 2008 ACS Ancestry estimates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_DP2&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-format=|title=American FactFinder - Results|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=Factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="legis.state.pa.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2009&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=S&amp;billTyp=R&amp;billNbr=0141&amp;pn=1216|title=Regular Session 2009-2010 Senate Resolution 141 P.N. 1216 |website=Legis.state.pa.us|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Third Reich]], the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], led by Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler]], attempted to unite all the people they claimed were "Germans" (''[[Volksdeutsche]]'') under the slogan ''Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer'' ("One People, One Empire, One Leader"). This policy began in 1938 with Hitler's foreign policy ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' ("back home to the Reich") which aimed to persuade all Germans living outside of the Reich to return "home" either as individuals or regions to a Greater Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H.

The [[Swiss people|Swiss]] resisted the idea. They had viewed themselves as a distinctly separate nation since the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648.

After World War II, eastern European countries such as the [[Soviet Union]], [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] expelled the Germans from their territories. Many of those had inhabited these lands for centuries, developing a unique culture. Germans were also forced to leave the [[former eastern territories of Germany]], which were annexed by Poland ([[Silesia]], [[Pomerania]], parts of [[Brandenburg]] and southern part of [[East Prussia]]) and the [[Soviet Union]] (northern part of [[East Prussia]]). Between 12 and 16,5 million [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|ethnic Germans and German citizens]] were expelled westwards to [[allied-occupied Germany]].

After World War II, [[Austrians]] increasingly saw themselves as a separate nation from the German nation. In 1966, 47% people in Austria viewed themselves as Austrians. In 1990, the number increased to 79%.&lt;ref name="AUSTRIAN NATIONAL IDENTITY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/austria/61.htm|title=Austria - AUSTRIAN NATIONAL IDENTITY|website=Countrystudies.us|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent polls show that no more than 6% of the German-speaking Austrians consider themselves as "''Germans''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://iiss210.joanneum.at/demokratiezentrum2/media/pdf/bruckmueller.pdf.].

===1945 to present===
Before the [[collapse of communism]] and the [[reunification of Germany]] in 1990, Germans constituted the largest ''divided'' nation in Europe by far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toponline.org/books/kits/germany%20in%20europe/handout7.pdf|title=Europe's Rising Regionalism|website=Toponline.org|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stefanwolff.com/files/Germany%20and%20German%20Minorities%20in%20Europe.pdf|title=Germany and German Minorities in Europe|website=Stefanwolff.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Divided'' refers to relatively strong regionalism among the Germans within the Federal Republic of Germany. The events of the 20th century also affected the nation. As a result, the German people remain divided in the 21st century, though the degree of division is one much diminished after two world wars, the Cold War, and the German reunification.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1987, about 1.4&amp;nbsp;million ethnic Germans and their dependents, mostly from Poland and Romania, arrived in Germany under special provisions of [[Aussiedler|right of return]]. With the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] since 1987, 3 million "Aussiedler" – ethnic Germans, mainly from Eastern Europe and the former [[Soviet Union]] – took advantage of Germany's law of return to leave the ''"land of their birth"'' for Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?ID=201 |title=Fewer Ethnic Germans Immigrating to Ancestral Homeland |publisher=Migrationinformation.org |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 2 million, just from the territories of the former Soviet Union, have resettled in Germany since the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egms.de/en/meetings/gmds2005/05gmds163.shtml |title=External causes of death in a cohort of Aussiedler from the former Soviet Union, 1990–2002 |publisher=Egms.de |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, significant numbers of ethnic Germans have moved from Germany to other European countries, especially [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]], Britain, Spain and [[Portugal]].

In its ''State of World Population 2006'' report, the United Nations Population Fund lists Germany with hosting the third-highest percentage of the main international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 10 million of all 191 million migrants.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Population Fund: [http://www.unfpa.org/publications/detail.cfm?ID=294&amp;filterListType= State of World Population 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

People of German origin are found in various places around the globe. [[United States]] is home to approximately 50 million [[German Americans]] or one third of the German diaspora, making it the largest centre of German-descended people outside Germany. [[German Brazilians|Brazil]] is the second largest with 5 million people claiming German ancestry. Other significant centres are [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[South Africa]] and [[France]] each accounting for at least 1 million. While the exact number of German-descended people is difficult to calculate, the available data makes it safe to claim the number is exceeding 100 million people.&lt;ref name="Europe 2011 p. 171"/&gt;

German literature can be traced back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most notable authors of the period being [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]].
The ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', whose author remains unknown, is also an important work of the epoch, as is the ''[[Thidrekssaga]]''.  The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.

Theologian [[Martin Luther|Luther]], who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern "High German" language. Among the most admired German poets and authors are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]], [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]] and [[Arno Schmidt|Schmidt]].  Nine Germans have won the [[Nobel Prize in literature]]: [[Theodor Mommsen]], [[Paul von Heyse]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Nelly Sachs]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Heinrich Böll]], [[Günter Grass]], and [[Herta Müller]].

===Philosophy===
{{Main article|German philosophy}}

Germany's influence on philosophy is historically significant and many notable German philosophers have helped shape [[Western philosophy]] since the Middle Ages. The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]

[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies|Tönnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.

In the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John.

===Cinema===
{{Main article|Cinema of Germany}}
[[File:Diane Kruger at 2008 Venice Film Festival-01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Diane Krüger]], 2008]]

German cinema dates back to the very early years of the medium with the work of [[Max Skladanowsky]]. It was particularly influential during the years of the [[Weimar Republic]] with [[German expressionism|German expressionists]] such as [[Robert Wiene]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau]]. The [[Nazi era]] produced mostly propaganda films although the work of [[Leni Riefenstahl]] still introduced new aesthetics in film. From the 1960s, [[New German Cinema]] directors such as [[Volker Schlöndorff]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Wim Wenders]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] placed [[West Germany|West-German]] cinema back onto the international stage with their often provocative films, while the [[DEFA (film studio)|DEFA]] film studio controlled film production in the [[East Germany|GDR]].

More recently, films such as ''[[Das Boot]]'' (1981), ''[[The NeverEnding Story (film)|The Never Ending Story]]'' (1984) ''[[Run Lola Run]]'' (1998), ''[[Das Experiment]]'' (2001), ''[[Good Bye Lenin!]]'' (2003), ''[[Head-On (film)|Gegen die Wand (Head-on)]]'' (2004) and ''[[Der Untergang|Der Untergang (Downfall)]]'' (2004) have enjoyed international success. In 2002 the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film went to [[Caroline Link]]'s [[Nowhere in Africa]], in 2007 to [[Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck]]'s [[The Lives of Others]]. The [[Berlin International Film Festival]], held yearly since 1951, is one of the world's foremost film and cinema festivals.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070109173533/http://www.fiapf.org/pdf/2006accreditedFestivalsDirectory.pdf 2006 FIAPF accredited Festivals Directory], International Federation of Film Producers Associations.

The nation was particularly important in the early [[modern architecture|modern movement]] through the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] and the [[Bauhaus]] movement identified with [[Walter Gropius]].  The [[Nazi architecture|Nazis]] closed these movements and favoured a type of [[neo-classical architecture|neo-classicism]].

===Religion===
[[File:Martin Luther, 1529.jpg|upright|thumb|Portrait of [[Martin Luther]]]]

Roman Catholicism was the sole established religion in the Holy Roman Empire until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed this drastically. In 1517, Martin Luther challenged the Catholic Church as he saw it as a corruption of Christian faith. Through this, he altered the course of European and world history and established Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Plass, Ewald M., ''What Luther Says: An Anthology'', St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1959, 2:964.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history. The war was fought primarily in what is now Germany, and at various points involved most of the countries of Europe. The war was fought largely as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Frederick, ''History of the Thirty Years' War'', p.1, Harper Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Census in Germany|the latest nationwide census]], Roman Catholics constituted 29.5% of the total population of Germany, followed by the Evangelical Protestants at 27.9%. Other Christian denominations, other religions, atheists or not specified constituted 42.6% of the population at the time. Among "others" are Protestants not included in [[Evangelical Church of Germany]], and other Christians such as the [[Restorationist]] [[New Apostolic Church]]. Protestantism was more common among the citizens of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ergebnisse.zensus2011.de/auswertungsdb/download?pdf=00&amp;tableId=0&amp;locale=DE&amp;gmdblt=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525033109/https://ergebnisse.zensus2011.de/auswertungsdb/download?pdf=00&amp;tableId=0&amp;locale=DE&amp;gmdblt=1 |archivedate=25 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; The North and East Germany is predominantly Protestant, the South and West rather Catholic.

Historically, Germany had a substantial [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish minority]]. Only a few thousand people of Jewish origin remained in Germany after [[the Holocaust]], but the German Jewish community now has approximately 100,000 members, many from the former [[Soviet Union]]. Germany also has a substantial Muslim minority, most of whom are immigrants from [[Turkey]].

German theologians include [[Martin Luther|Luther]],  [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], and [[Rudolf Otto]]. Also Germany brought up many [[mysticism|mystics]] including [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Jakob Boehme]], and some popes (e.g. [[Benedict XVI]]).

During the last decade of the 20th century, Germany changed its attitude towards immigrants. Until the mid-1990s the opinion was widespread that Germany is not a country of immigration, even though about 20% of the population were of non-German origin. Today the government and a majority of the German society are acknowledging that immigrants from diverse ethnocultural backgrounds are part of the German society and that controlled immigration should be initiated based on qualification standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Friedrich | last = Heckmann | url = https://books.google.com/?id=l9yTtCAnQWwC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=cdu+immigrant+einwanderungsland#PPA53,M1 | title = The Integration of Immigrants in European Societies: national differences and trends of convergence| publisher=Lucius &amp; Lucius | location = Stuttgart |pages=51ff. | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-3-8282-0181-1 | accessdate =28 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the politics that ensued has been cited as the origins of German identity that arose in response to the spread of a common German language and literature.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=189}} Early German national culture was developed through literary and religious figures including [[Martin Luther]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]].{{sfn|Kesselman|2009|pp=180}} The concept of a German nation was developed by German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=189–190}} The popularity of German identity arose in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Jeffrey E.

Persons who speak German as their first language, look German and whose families have lived in Germany for generations are considered "most German", followed by categories of diminishing Germanness such as [[Aussiedler]] (people of German ancestry whose families have lived in Eastern Europe but who have returned to Germany), Restdeutsche (people living in lands that have historically belonged to Germany but which is currently outside of Germany), Auswanderer (people whose families have emigrated from Germany and who still speak German), German speakers in German-speaking nations such as [[Austrians]], and finally people of German emigrant background who no longer speak German.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, Diana. 1989. German identity and the problem of history. ''History and ethnicity'', p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

Pan-Germanism's origins began in the early 19th century following the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states. The new German nationalists, mostly young reformers such as Johann Tillmann of [[East Prussia]], sought to unite all the German-speaking and ethnic-German (Volksdeutsche) people.

By the 1860s the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] were the two most powerful nations dominated by German-speaking elites. Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire – like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] – was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] ("Second Reich") was created in 1871 as "Little Germany" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule. 

The creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire. [[German nationalism in Austria]] grew among all social circles of the empire, many wanted to be unified with the German Reich to form a [[Greater Germany]] and wanted policies to be carried out to enforce their German ethnic identity rejecting any Austrian pan-ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="DPSO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in Österreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German language | location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many German Austrians felt annoyed that they were excluded from the German Empire since it included various non-German ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Kurt |last=Bauer |title=Nationalsozialismus: Ursprünge, Anfänge, Aufstieg und Fall |publisher=Böhlau Verlag |year=2008 |page=41 |language=German language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9L1GyROMi0C&amp;pg=PA41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Austrian pan-Germans such as [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer]]  created pan-German movements which demanded the annexation of all ethnic German territories. Members of such movements often wore blue [[Centaurea cyanus|cornflowers]], known to be the favourite flower of German Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]], in their buttonholes, along with [[cockades]] in the German national colours (black, red, and yellow).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Eva |last=Giloi |title=Monarchy, Myth, and Material Culture in Germany 1750–1950 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |pages=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both symbols were temporarily banned in Austrian schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Daniel L. |last=Unowsky |title=The Pomp and Politics of Patriotism: Imperial Celebrations in Habsburg Austria, 1848–1916 |publisher=Purdue University Press |year=2005 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Populists such as the Viennese major [[Karl Lueger]] used anti-semitism and pan-Germanism for their own political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Hamann, Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Bismarck's victory over Austria in 1866 which ultimately excluded Austria and the German Austrians from the Reich, many Austrian pan-Germans idolized him.&lt;ref&gt; Suppan (2008). ′Germans′ in the Habsburg Empire.

Following the defeat in World War I, influence of German-speaking elites over [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe was greatly limited. At the [[Treaty of Versailles]] Germany was substantially reduced in size. Austria-Hungary was split up. The former German-speaking areas of Austria-Hungary was reduced to a rump state called the "[[Republic of German-Austria]]" (German: ''Deutschösterreich''). On November 12, the National Assembly declared the rump state a republic and Social Democrat [[Karl Renner]] as provisional chancellor. On the same day, it drafted a provisional constitution which stated that "German-Austria is a democratic republic" (Article 1) and "German-Austria is an integral part of the German reich" (Article 2) with the hope of joining Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred D. Low, The Anschluss Movement, 1918-1919, and the Paris Peace Conference, pp. 135-138&lt;/ref&gt; The name "German-Austria" and union with Germany were forbidden by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the Treaty of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Stackelberg, Hitler's Germany: Origins, Interpretations, Legacies, pp. 161-162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1920/3.html |title=Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Austria; Protocol, Declaration and Special Declaration [1920&amp;#93; ATS 3 |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; German-Austria lost the territories of the Sudetenland and German Bohemia to Czechoslovakia, South Tyrol to Italy, and southern Carinthia and Styria to Yugoslavia and the rump state was renamed "Republic of Austria". With these changes, the era of the [[First Austrian Republic]] began.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Margaret Ball, Post-war German-Austrian Relations: The Anschluss Movement, 1918-1936, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; These events are sometimes considered to be a pre-''[[Anschluss]]'' attempt.

During the 1920s, the constitutions of both the First Austrian Republic and the [[Wiemar Republic]] included the goal of union between the two countries which was supported by all different political parties. In the early 1930s, before the Nazis seized power, popularity for union between Austria and Germany remained strong and the Austrian government looked at the possibility of a [[customs union]] with Germany in 1931 but this was stopped by French opposition.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Patch, Heinrich Bruning and the Dissolution of the Weimar Republic, pp. 120, 166, 190&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, after Austrian-born Hitler came to power, support for an ''Anschluss'' grew. The [[Austrofascism]] era of [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Dollfuss]]/[[Kurt Schuschnigg|Schuschnigg]] between 1934-1938 accepted that Austrians were Germans and that Austria was a "German state" but was strongly opposed to Hitler's desire to annex Austria to the Third Reich and wished for Austria to remain independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vsl6mwMXl4YC&amp;pg=PA37|title=Constructing and Deconstructing National Identity: Dramatic Discourse in Tom Murphy's The Patriot Game and Felix Mitterer's In Der Löwengrube|first=Birgit|last=Ryschka|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Peter Lang|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' initiative (German: literally ''Home into the Reich'', meaning ''Back to Reich'', see [[Reich]]) was a policy pursued by [[Nazi Germany]] which attempted to convince people of German descent living outside of Germany (such as [[Sudetenland]]) that they should strive to bring these regions "home" into a greater Germany. This policy began in 1938 on 12 March when Hitler annexed Austria to the Third Reich.

[[Volga Germans]] living in the [[Soviet Union]] were interned in [[gulag]]s or forcibly relocated during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Volga Germans: In Russia and the Americas, from 1763 to the Present|author1=Fred C.

Nationalism and Pan-Germanism became almost taboo because they had been used so destructively by the Nazis. Indeed, the word "Volksdeutscher" in reference to ethnic Germans naturalized during WWII later developed into a mild epithet.

From the 1960s, Germany also saw increasing immigration, especially from Turkey, under an official programme aimed at encouraging "[[Gastarbeiter]]" or guestworkers to the country to provide labour during the post-war economic boom years. Although it had been expected that such workers would return home, many settled in Germany, with their descendants becoming German citizens.&lt;ref name="Spiegel"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/at-home-in-a-foreign-country-german-turks-struggle-to-find-their-identity-a-795299.html At Home in a Foreign Country: German Turks Struggle to Find Their Identity], Spiegel Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further information|German reunification}}

However, [[German reunification]] in 1990 revived the old debates. The fear of nationalistic misuse of Pan-Germanism nevertheless remains strong. But the overwhelming majority of Germans today are not chauvinistic in nationalism, but in 2006 and again in 2010, the [[German National Football Team]] won third place in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]s, ignited a positive scene of German pride, enhanced by success in sport.

For decades after the Second World War, any national symbol or expression was a taboo.&lt;ref name="Proud German"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/541844|title=Proud German? | work=The Economist | date=24 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Germans are becoming increasingly patriotic.&lt;ref name="Proud German"/&gt;&lt;ref name="generationaldynamics.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generationaldynamics.com/cgi-bin/D.PL?xct=gd.e060623 |title=Are Germans now proud to be the Germans? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129212013/http://www.generationaldynamics.com/cgi-bin/D.PL?xct=gd.e060623 |archivedate=29 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a study in 2009, in which some 2,000 German citizens age 14 and upwards filled out a questionnaire, nearly 60% of those surveyed agreed with the sentiment "I'm proud to be German." And 78%, if free to choose their nation, would opt for German nationality with "near or absolute certainty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/757-where-germans-dare |title=National Identity – Where Germans dare |publisher=Presseurop.eu |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in 2009, carried out by the Identity Foundation in Düsseldorf, showed that 73% of the Germans were proud of their country, twice more than 8 years earlier. According to Eugen Buss, a sociology professor at the University of Hohenheim, there's an ongoing normalisation and more and more Germans are becoming openly proud of their country.&lt;ref name="generationaldynamics.com"/&gt;

In the midst of the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], [[Radek Sikorski]], Poland's Foreign Minister, stated in November 2011, "I will probably be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so, but here it is: I fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity. You have become Europe's indispensable nation."&lt;ref name=Heilbrunn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heilbrunn|first=Jacob|title=All Roads Lead to Berlin|journal=The National Interest|date=November–December 2012|volume=Number 122|pages=41–47|url=http://nationalinterest.org/article/all-roads-lead-berlin-7622|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at [[The National Interest]], such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. "This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position at the center of the Continent."&lt;ref name="Heilbrunn"/&gt; Heilbrunn believes that the adage, "what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union" has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its [[Nazi]] past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="Heilbrunn"/&gt; The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister [[Radek Sikorski]]'s effusive praise for his country's western neighbor.&lt;ref name="Heilbrunn"/&gt; This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.

'''Harold Pinter and politics''' concerns the [[Ideology|political views]], [[civic engagement]], and [[political activism]] of British playwright [[Harold Pinter]] (1930–2008), the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Laureate in Literature]].

==Early political views==
In 1948–49, when he was 18, Pinter opposed the politics of the [[Cold War]], leading to his decision to become a [[conscientious objector]] and to refuse to comply with [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]].  But he was not a [[Pacifism|pacifist]].  He told Billington and others that, if he had been old enough at the time, he would have fought against the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in [[World War II]] (''Harold Pinter'' 21–24, 92, &amp; 286).  He seemed to express ambivalence about "politicians" in his 1966 ''[[The Paris Review|Paris Review]]'' interview conducted by [[Larry Bensky|Lawrence M. Bensky]]. Yet, he had actually been an early member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and also had supported the British [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] (1959–1994), participating in British artists' refusal to permit professional productions of their work in South Africa, by signing the "Public Declaration of Playwrights Against Apartheid" in 1963 (Hadley) and in subsequent related campaigns (Mbeki; Reddy).&lt;ref name=politics&gt;Discussion of Pinter's "political awareness" pertaining to his political development as a playwright and as a citizen appears in Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 234, 286–305 (Chap. 15: "Public Affairs"), 400–3, 412, 416–17, 423, &amp; 433–41 (a sec. on Pinter's Nobel Lecture, [[Art, Truth and Politics|"Art, Truth &amp; Politics"]], rpt. therein); Merritt, ''Pinter in Play'' xi–xii, xiv, 171–209 (Chap. 8: "Cultural Politics," espec. "Pinter and Politics"), 275; and Grimes; in sources that they cite; and in sources published in 1990 and afterward listed in the [[Swedish Academy]]'s [[#Bio-bibliography|"Bio-bibliography"]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later civic activities and political activism==
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], Pinter voted for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]s, led by [[Margaret Thatcher]], "as a protest against a strike at the National Theatre that was dogging a production he was directing." He later said of this that it was "the most shameful act of my life".&lt;ref name="guardian4-9-99"&gt;{{cite news

In his last twenty-five years, Pinter increasingly focused his essays, speeches, interviews, literary readings, and other public appearances directly on contemporary political issues. Pinter strongly opposed the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the 1999 [[NATO]] bombing campaign in [[Yugoslavia]] during the [[Kosovo War]], the United States' 2001 [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Invasion of Iraq]].  His political statements have elicited some strong public criticism and even, at times, provoked ridicule and personal attacks.&lt;ref name="HariPryce-Jones"&gt;See, e.g., responses to Pinter's winning the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in contemporaneous articles by Hari, Hitchens, and Pryce-Jones; [[cf.]] Allen-Mills, N. Cohen, and Kamm.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] (writing in the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'') defended Pinter against what he terms Pinter's "being berated by the belligerati" like Hari and others, who, unlike his supporters such as Edgar, [[Tom Stoppard|Sir Tom Stoppard]], [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]], and [[Václav Havel]], felt that Pinter did not "deserve" to win the Nobel Prize.&lt;ref name=PinterColossal&gt;See the text of Havel's and others' comments, excerpted and quoted in "&amp;nbsp;'A Colossal Figure'&amp;nbsp;", after his essay [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/pinter-torture-and-misery-in-name-of-freedom-510906.html "Pinter: Torture and Misery in the Name of Freedom"], adapted from his 2005 acceptance speech for the [[Wilfred Owen]] Award for poetry, rpt. in ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'', [[Independent News &amp; Media]], 16 October 2005, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 24 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In accepting an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Turin]] (27 November 2002), he stated: "I believe that [the United States] will [attack Iraq] not only to take control of Iraqi oil, but also because the American administration is now a bloodthirsty wild animal. Bombs are its only vocabulary."  Distinguishing between "the American administration" and American citizens, he added the following qualification: "Many Americans, we know, are horrified by the posture of their government but seem to be helpless" (''Various Voices'' [2005] 243). He was very active in the [[Peace movement|antiwar movement]] in the United Kingdom, speaking at rallies held by the [[Stop the War Coalition]] (StWC).&lt;ref name=Turinspeech&gt;An edited version of Pinter's Turin speech was published as an article with the explosive headline [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3585148/The-American-administration-is-a-bloodthirsty-wild-animal.html "The American administration is a bloodthirsty wild animal"], featuring Pinter's words from the speech without the internal quotation marks, in the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' on 11 December 2002.  Other versions of this speech are reprinted online with more generic headlines as "Harold Pinter Gives Honorary Doctorate Speech at Turin University—27 November 2002," in ''The Artists Network of [[Refuse and Resist|Refuse &amp; Resist!]]'', for example, and in print as "University of Turin Speech," in ''Various Voices'' (2005) 241–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his various public speeches and other appearances, describing former [[President of the United States]] [[George W. Bush]] as a "[[mass murder]]er" and former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair]] as both "mass-murdering" and a "deluded idiot", Pinter specified that, along with other past U.S. officials, under the [[Geneva Conventions]], they are "[[war crime|war criminals]]".&lt;ref name=War&gt;Rpt. in Pinter, ''War'' (n. pag.); qtd. in Chrisafis and Tilden.&lt;/ref&gt;  He compared the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]], in its striving to attain "world domination" through [[Full-spectrum dominance|"Full spectrum dominance"]]: "Nazi Germany wanted total domination of Europe and they nearly did it. The US wants total domination of the world and is about to consolidate that. … In a policy document, the US has used the term 'full-spectrum domination', that means control of land, sea, air and space, and that is exactly what's intended and what the US wants to fulfil. They are quite blatant about it."&lt;ref name=ChrisafisandTilden&gt;Qtd. in Chrisafis and Tilden.&lt;/ref&gt;  Referring to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], in a public reading presented in 2003, Pinter "blamed 'millions of totally deluded American people' for not staging a mass revolt" and "said that because of propaganda and control of the media, millions of Americans believed that every word Mr Bush said was 'accurate and moral'."&lt;ref name=ChrisafisandTilden/&gt;

==Official political statements==

On his official website, Pinter published his remarks to the mass peace protest demonstration held in London on 15 February 2003: "The United States is a monster out of control. Unless we challenge it with absolute determination American barbarism will destroy the world. The country is run by a bunch of criminal lunatics, with Blair as their hired Christian thug. The planned attack on Iraq is an act of premeditated mass murder" ("Speech at Hyde Park"). Those remarks anticipated his observation in his 2005 Nobel Lecture, "Art, Truth and Politics" that whereas Bush, like "all American presidents" had hypnotically enlisted "&amp;nbsp;'the American people to trust their president in the action he is about to take on behalf of the American people.'&amp;nbsp;"; nevertheless, "Many thousands, if not millions, of people in the United States itself are demonstrably sickened, shamed and angered by their government's actions, but as things stand they are not a coherent political force—yet. But the anxiety, uncertainty and fear which we can see growing daily in the United States is unlikely to diminish" (21).

In accepting the [[Wilfred Owen]] Award for Poetry, on 18 March 2005, wondering "What would Wilfred Owen make of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]? A bandit act, an act of blatant [[state terrorism]], demonstrating absolute contempt for the conception of [[international law]]?", Pinter concluded: "I believe Wilfred Owen would share our contempt, our revulsion, our nausea and our shame at both the language and the actions of the American and British governments" (''Various Voices'' [2005] 247–48).  The following year, in March 2006, upon accepting the [[Europe Theatre Prize]], in [[Turin]], Pinter exhorted the mostly European audience "to resist the power of the United States," stating, "I'd like to see Europe echo the example of Latin America in withstanding the economic and political intimidation of the United States. This is a serious responsibility for Europe and all of its citizens."&lt;ref name=AndersonBillington&gt;Qtd. in Anderson and Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinter was active in [[International PEN]], serving as a [[vice president]], along with American playwright [[Arthur Miller]]. In 1985, Pinter and Miller went to [[Turkey]], on a mission co-sponsored by International PEN and a [[Helsinki Watch]] committee to investigate and protest against the torture of imprisoned writers. There he met victims of political oppression and their families. At an American [[Diplomatic mission|embassy]] dinner in [[Ankara]], held in Miller's honour, at which Pinter was also an invited guest, speaking on behalf of those imprisoned Turkish writers, Pinter confronted the ambassador with (in Pinter's words) "the reality ... of electric current on your genitals": Pinter's outspokenness apparently angered their host, who asked Pinter to leave, and, in solidarity, Miller left the embassy with him. Recounting this episode for a tribute to Miller on his 80th birthday, Pinter concluded: "Being thrown out of the US embassy in Ankara with Arthur Miller—a voluntary exile—was one of the proudest moments in my life" ("Arthur Miller's Socks," ''Various Voices'' [2005] 56–57). Pinter's experiences in Turkey and his knowledge of the Turkish suppression of the [[Kurdish language]] "inspired" his 1988 play ''[[Mountain Language]]''.&lt;ref name=BillingtonGussow&gt;See Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 309–10; and Gussow, ''Conversations with Pinter'' 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also an active member of the [[Cuba Solidarity Campaign]], an organisation describing itself as one which "campaigns in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] against the [[United States|US]] blockade of [[Cuba]] and for the Cuban peoples' right to self-determination and sovereignty".&lt;ref name=CubaSolidarityCampaign&gt;[http://www.cuba-solidarity.org/aims.asp "Our Aims"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zu8yXplB?url=http://www.cuba-solidarity.org/aims.asp |date=3 July 2011 }}, official website, Cuba Solidarity Campaign, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 13 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although conceding that the former Serb leader was "ruthless and savage", in 2001 Pinter joined the International Committee to Defend [[Slobodan Milošević]] (ICDSM),&lt;ref&gt;Fiachra Gibbons [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/26/warcrimes.balkans1 "Free Milosevic, says Pinter"], ''The Guardian'', 26 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt; which appealed for the former Serbian leader to be given a fair trial and for his freedom, signing a related "Artists' Appeal for Milošević" in 2004.&lt;ref name=ICDSM&gt;ICDSM continued its presence on the [[World Wide Web|Web]] even after Milošević's death in 2006, still featuring the slogan "Free [[Slobodan Milošević]]!!!" on its official website.&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;http://www.icdsm.com/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Pinter's support of the appeal and his signing the petition received some condemnation in the [[mass media|public media]]; e.g., see Hari.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICDSMpetitionnames&gt;[http://www.icdsm.info/files/signedby.htm Signatures], ICDSM, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 13 June 2009.

It is filled with postings by anonymous users.  There are more reliable sources than email lists to use; restored earlier content endnote, with still-relevant contextual citations; it contains reference to Hari (list in Works cited).--&gt;

==Political activism in his final years==

In the last few years of his life, Pinter continued to contribute letters to the editor, essays, speeches, and poetry strongly expressing his artistic and political viewpoints, which were frequently published initially in British [[Periodical publication|periodical]]s, both in print and electronic media, and distributed and re-distributed extensively over the internet and throughout the [[blogosphere]]. These were distributed more widely after his winning the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 2005; his subsequent publications and related news accounts cite his status as a Nobel Laureate.  Later he continued to sign petitions on behalf of artistic and political causes that he supported.  He signed the mission statement of [[Jews for Justice for Palestinians]] in 2005 and its full-page advertisement, "What Is Israel Doing? A Call by Jews in Britain", published in ''[[The Times]]'' on 6 July 2006. He also co-signed an open letter about events in the Middle East dated 19 July 2006, distributed to the [[mass media|press]] on 21 July 2006, and posted on the website of [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref name=Chomskyetal&gt;See "Letter from Pinter, Saramago, Chomsky and Berger"; Chomsky, "Israel, Lebanon, and Palestine"; and "Palestinian Nation Under Threat".&lt;/ref&gt;  On 5 February 2007 ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that, along with historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], human rights lawyer [[Geoffrey Bindman]], fashion designer [[Nicole Farhi]], film director [[Mike Leigh]], and actors [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Zoë Wanamaker]], among others, Harold Pinter launched the organization [[Independent Jewish Voices]] in the United Kingdom "to represent British Jews ... in response to a perceived pro-Israeli bias in existing Jewish bodies in the UK", and, according to Hobsbawm, "as a counter-balance to the uncritical support for Israeli policies by established bodies such as the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]" (Hodgson; [[Independent Jewish Voices#IJV Declaration|IJV Declaration]]).  In March 2007 American television interviewer and journalist [[Charlie Rose]] conducted "A Conversation with Harold Pinter" on ''[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]]'', filmed at the [[Old Vic]], in London, and broadcast on television in the United States on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].  They discussed highlights of his career and the politics of his life and work. They debated his ongoing opposition to the [[Iraq War]], with Rose challenging some of Pinter's views about the United States. They also discussed some of his other public protests and positions in public controversies, such as that involving the [[New York Theatre Workshop]]'s cancellation of their production of ''[[My Name Is Rachel Corrie]]'', which Pinter viewed as an act of cowardice amounting to [[self-censorship]].  In mid-June 2008, opposing "a police ban on the George Bush Not Welcome Here" demonstration organized by the [[Stop the War Coalition]] (StWC), "Pinter commented, 'The ban on the Stop The War Coalition march in protest at the visit of President Bush to this country [England] is a totalitarian act.  In what is supposed to be a free country the Coalition has every right to express its views peacefully and openly.  This ban is outrageous and makes the term "democracy" laughable'."&lt;ref name=Protesters&gt;Qtd. in "Protesters Will Defy Ban."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retrospective perspective on political aspects of his early works==
[[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]]'s argument in "Pinter's Weasels" that "The idea that he was a dissenting figure only in later life ignores the politics of his early work," echoes Pinter's own retrospective perspective on it.  In "A Play and Its Politics", an interview conducted by [[Nick Hern Books|Nicholas Hern]] in February 1985 and published in the Methuen and Grove Press editions of ''[[One for the Road (Harold Pinter play)|One for the Road]]'', Pinter described his earlier plays retrospectively from the perspective of the politics of power and the dynamics of oppression.&lt;ref name=MerrittPandP&gt;Qtd. in Merritt, "Pinter and Politics," ''Pinter in Play'' 171–89.&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed such a perspective on his work when he participated in "Meet the Author" with Ramona Koval, at the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]], in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, on the evening of 25 August 2006. It was his first public appearance in Britain since he had won the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature and his near-death experience in hospital in the first week of December 2005, which had prevented him from going to Stockholm to give his Nobel Lecture in person. Pinter described how he felt while almost dying (as if he were "drowning"). After reading an interrogation scene from ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'', he explained that he "wanted to say that Goldberg and McCann represented the forces in society who wanted to snuff out dissent, to stifle Stanley's voice, to silence him," and that in 1958 "One thing [the critics who almost unanimously hated the play] got wrong ... was the whole history of stifling, suffocating and destroying dissent. Not too long before, the Gestapo had represented order, discipline, family life, obligation—and anyone who disagreed with that was in trouble."&lt;ref name=McDowell&gt;Qtd. in McDowell, who observes that Pinter's willingness to explain his work on this occasion was a "rare" occurrence.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both his writing and his public speaking, McDowell observes,{{quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;Pinter's precision of language is immensely political. Twist words like "democracy" and "freedom", as he believes Blair and Bush have done over Iraq, and hundreds of thousands of people die.&lt;br /&gt;
In [March 2006], when he was presented with the European [sic] Theatre Prize in [[Turin]], Pinter said he intended to spend the rest of his life railing against the United States. Surely, asked chair Ramona Koval, [at the Edinburgh Book Festival that August], he was doomed to fail?&lt;br /&gt;
"Oh yes—me against the United States!" he said, laughing along with the audience at the absurdity, before adding: "But I can't stop reacting to what is done in our name, and what is being done in the name of freedom and democracy is disgusting."&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

=="Politics" at ''HaroldPinter.org''==

In 2000 Harold Pinter launched his official website, which includes a section specifically devoted to his interest and activities in "Politics" with a hyperlinked subsection listing the political organisations and causes that he supported during his lifetime.  The site includes some hyperlinks to another section, containing Pinter's politically charged poetry.   Prior to his death, these parts of his official website were occasionally updated periodically by his various personal assistants.&lt;ref name=Merrittglobal&gt;For further discussion of the launching of this website as it pertains to Pinter's reputation as an "international playwright", see Merritt, "(Anti-)Global Pinter" 140–41.  Subsequent updating of Pinter's official website is the purview of Pinter's agent, Judy Daish and Associates, acting on behalf of his estate.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Harold Pinter Community Discussion Forum'' at ''HaroldPinter.org'' contains threads pertaining to Pinter and politics. Leading up to and after the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], these threads became more frequent and at times more heated in nature, particular in reference to Pinter's opposition to that [[Iraq War]], his other political activism and statements relating to it, and his winning of the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

==Approval of the election of U.S. President Barack Obama==
In the final months of his life, Pinter demonstrated his enthusiastic approval of the election of [[Barack Obama]] as [[President of the United States|U.S. President]].&lt;ref name=PinterObama&gt;Reported by Pinter's close friend actor and director [[Harry Burton (actor)|Harry Burton]] in remarks made in the panel discussion on "Pinter and Politics" at the [[PEN World Voices]] Tribute to Harold Pinter, held in [[New York City]] on 2 May 2009, which Burton curated and moderated.

'''Harry Andrew Jackson''' (April 18, 1924 – April 25, 2011), born '''Harry Aaron Shapiro Jr.''', was an American artist. He began his career as a Marine combat artist, then later worked in the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]], [[Realism (arts)|realist]], and American western styles.

==Early life and military career==

During his time in the [[meatpacking]] district, Jackson was fascinated by the cowboys he met there and developed an interest in the [[American frontier]] and [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre.]]

Harry Aaron Shapiro Jr. was born to Harry Shapiro and Ellen Jackson in [[Chicago]] on April 18, 1924.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of Harry Jackson|url=http://www.meeteetsemuseums.org/harry_jackson.pdf|publisher=Meeteetse Museum|accessdate=May 6, 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name was changed to Harry Andrew Jackson after his parents divorced.&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Grimes|first=William|title=Harry Jackson, Artist Who Captured the West, Dies at 87|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/arts/design/harry-jackson-artist-who-captured-the-west-dies-at-87.html?_r=0|accessdate=May 5, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=April 28, 2011}} Note: A version of this article appears in print on April 30, 2011, on page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: "Harry Jackson, 87, Artist of American West".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McLellan"&gt;{{cite news|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|title=Harry Jackson dies at 87; Western artist created famed John Wayne sculpture|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/01/local/la-me-harry-jackson-20110501|accessdate=May 5, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 1, 2011|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|issn=0458-3035|oclc=3638237}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Jackson sometimes skipped classes and wandered the streets of Chicago.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt; He worked in his mother's lunchroom in the [[Union Stock Yards]]. Jackson liked the cowboys he met there and developed an interest in the [[American frontier]] and [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre starting at a young age.

In 1942, when he was eighteen years old, Jackson enlisted in the [[Marines]] during [[World War II]] and became a [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]] artist for the Fifth Amphibious Corps.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt; He was wounded during the [[Battle of Tarawa]] in November 1943, and later in [[Saipan]].&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt; The injuries earned him two [[Purple Heart]]s and left Jackson suffering from [[epileptic seizure]]s, [[mood disorder]]s, and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StorrowAugust"&gt;{{cite news|last=Storrow|first=Benjamin|title=What will become of Harry Jackson's life work?|url=http://trib.com/lifestyles/home-and-garden/what-will-become-of-harry-jackson-s-life-work/article_7e19337d-ca46-5b25-b29b-55d6236dc21d.html|accessdate=May 6, 2016|work=Casper Star-Tribune|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Webb"&gt;{{cite news|last=Webb|first=Jaci|title=Work of Wyoming artist Harry Jackson up for sale|url=http://billingsgazette.com/entertainment/work-of-wyoming-artist-harry-jackson-up-for-sale/article_e93a2eb3-5820-544d-94dd-469778091f53.html|accessdate=May 6, 2016|work=[[Billings Gazette]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|date=April 24, 2014|issn=2372-868X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1944, Jackson returned to the United States and became the youngest ever Marine Corps [[War artist|combat artist]] at age twenty. He was stationed in [[Los Angeles]] and, in this role, drew and painted "[his] bloodiest close-combat experiences".&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt; Jackson was honorably [[Military discharge|discharged]] in October 1945. He spent the winter season at Pitchfork Ranch before relocating to New York in May 1946.&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt;

==Abstract expressionism to realism==
[[File:Red, Yellow, and Blue (1951), Harry Jackson.jpg|thumb|''Red, Yellow, and Blue'' (1951)]]
While in Los Angeles, Jackson's style was strongly influenced by [[Jackson Pollock]]'s painting ''The Moon-Woman Cuts the Circle'', which he said "shot the first crack of daylight into my blocked-off brain".&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt; Jackson recalled, "That single artwork caused me to relive (1943) Tarawa's bloody butchery; I knew that I had to meet Pollock face to face ASAP."&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt; He was also influenced by [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s work.&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt;

During this "artistic conversion", Jackson moved to [[New York City|New York]],&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; befriended Pollock, and began painting in the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] style.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt; He gained a following after art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] and art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] included Jackson in their "Talent 1950" exhibition at the Kootz Gallery.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt; Greenberg said that Jackson produced "the best first show since Jackson Pollock's".&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; For the next few years, he exhibited work at the [[Tibor de Nagy Gallery]], which is closely affiliated with the second generation of abstract expressionism.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;

Jackson's travels to Europe in the early 1950s influenced him to become a [[Realism (arts)|realist]] artist instead of an abstract expressionist painter. In 1956, ''Life'' profiled him in an eight-page [[photo-essay]] called "Painter Striving to Find Himself: Harry Jackson Turns to the Hard Way", describing Jackson as an "American painter of surging talent and ambition".&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; Jackson moved back to Wyoming in 1970.&lt;ref name="StorrowAugust"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schweizer|first=Micah|title=Sun May Set on the Collected Works of a Western Icon|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/12/14/250286312/sun-may-set-on-the-collected-works-of-a-western-icon|accessdate=May 6, 2016|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1980s, he was one of the highest-paid American artists.&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt;

Jackson later recalled of his time in New York and transition to realism: "After Cézanne a lot of artists made art for art's sake, and when I became an Abstract Expressionist in New York I was among them".&lt;ref name="Saar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saar|first=Meghan|title=Judgment of Paris: Coeur d'Alene's auction of Harry Jackson's estate recalls a sobering moment for the artist as a collector.|journal=[[True West Magazine]]|date=October 4, 2011|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/judgment-of-paris-2/|accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the New York school was "too removed from man" and "did not speak to the people I was born and raised with. ... [[John Wayne]] spoke for these people ... he was a wonderful embodiment of the timeless strength of the rugged individualist, the one-man majority I believe in with my entire being."&lt;ref name="Saar"/&gt;

From the late 1990s to 2006, Jackson returned to painting. His work harkened back to his abstract expressionist experiments and military experiences, and also include "more peaceful, even transcendental registers of feeling" in the "Quartet" paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucrossfoundation.org/files/2014/2687/9404/HarryJackson_8_panel.pdf|last=McConell|first=Gordon|date=2015|title=Well-Aimed Lightning: The Abstract Art of Harry Jackson|format=PDF|publisher=[[Ucross Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:The Range Burial (1963), Harry Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|''The Range Burial'' (1963)]]
Among Jackson's combat artworks were ''Betio Beachhead'' (1944), ''Marine in Battle'' (1944), and ''Charging Under Fire'' (1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combat Art|url=http://www.harryjacksonstudios.com/works-of-art/combat-art/|publisher=Harry Jackson Studios|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his first realist works was the large-scale painting ''The Italian Bar'' (1956),&lt;ref name="Other"&gt;{{cite web|title=Other Paintings|url=http://www.harryjacksonstudios.com/works-of-art/other-paintings/|publisher=Harry Jackson Studios|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts a tavern and its patrons on [[Little Italy]]'s [[Mulberry Street (Manhattan)|Mulberry Street]].&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt; The work has been called "one of the most important portrait paintings in American 20th century art".&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; In 1958, he was commissioned by Ambassador [[Robert Douglas Coe]] and the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]]'s Whitney Gallery of Western Art, in Cody, to create the sequential paintings ''The Stampede'' (1965) and ''The Range Burial'' (1963), which were installed in 1965.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt; Western influences are seen in these works, which depict a longhorn stampede dragging a cowboy off his horse, and his subsequent funeral.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WACC"&gt;{{cite web|title=A cowboy artist with roots in Courbet and Capone|url=http://www.williamstownart.org/artconservator/images/AC4.2.pdf|publisher=Williamstown Art Conservation Center|accessdate=May 9, 2016|work=Art Conservator|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson dedicated ''The Range Burial'' to Pollock. Both works were loaned to the Atlanta Art Conservation Center in 2009 for conservation.&lt;ref name="WACC"/&gt; The {{Convert|10|x|21|ft|m|adj=on}} paintings were also executed as bronzes and [[Lithography|lithographs]].&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt; In the mid-1960s, Jackson created a portrait of [[Bob Dylan]] during a transitional time in the singer's career.&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt;

In 1969, Jackson sculpted ''The Marshal'' for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', which depicted Wayne as [[Rooster Cogburn (character)|Rooster Cogburn]] in the film ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'', riding a horse and carrying a rifle.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt; Following Wayne's death in 1979, Jackson was commissioned by [[Great Western Bank (1919–97)|Great Western Savings &amp; Loan]] to create a sculpture of Wayne, who had appeared in a series of commercials for the company during his last two years, for the Great Western Savings &amp; Loan building (now Flynt Building) along [[Wilshire Boulevard]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]].&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt; Prior to ''The Horseman''{{'s}} debut, the Beverly Hills Architectural Commission requested multiple changes, including the removal of multicolored paint and a motor in its base that would have slowly rotated the sculpture.&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braund"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braund|first1=Simon|title=The Last Boy Scout|journal=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=November 1, 2008|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1903462991.html|accessdate=May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{Convert|21|ft|m|adj=on}}, {{Convert|6|t|kg|adj=on}} [[bronze sculpture]] was dedicated in 1984.&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt; In 1980, the monumental sculpture Sacagawea was dedicated at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://centerofthewest.org/2015/08/18/sculpture-guide-sacagawea/|title=Sculpture Guide: Sacagawea|publisher=Buffalo Bill Center of the West|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 2005 and May 2006, Jackson completed the first six of his "Quartet" paintings, which he said "indicate the blissfully liberating spirit of Kandinsky and Pollock".&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt; The first four are featured in the film ''Harry Jackson Talks About Art'', which is about the intersection of Jackson's abstract and realist work. His bronze sculpture ''Sacajawea Modified II'' (2005) was the featured work for the 2006 Buffalo Bill Art Show and Sale, for which Jackson was named "Honored Artist".&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt;

In 2007, [[California State University, Northridge]] opened the Washington Mutual Gallery in the campus' Redwood Hall, showcasing thirty Jackson sculptures on permanent display. The collection's bronzes, valued at $740,000, depict cowboys, Native Americans, and early Western life, and were donated by [[Washington Mutual]] in 2006 to commemorate the "profound role Cal State Northridge plays in the cultural life of the region".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Briefly|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9093483.html|accessdate=May 11, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=April 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington Mutual Bank Gives Harry Jackson Art Collection to Cal State Northridge|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1125879951.html|publisher=United States Federal News Service ([[HT Media]])|accessdate=May 11, 2016|date=April 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California State University, Northridge Opens Washington Mutual Gallery, New Home for Harry Jackson Bronze Collection|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1207745981.html|publisher=United States Federal News Service (HT Media)|accessdate=May 11, 2016|date=January 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal and later life==
[[File:Joan Baez Bob Dylan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joan Baez]] and [[Bob Dylan]] in 1963. Jackson performed with both at [[Carnegie Hall]] and, in the mid-1960s, created a portrait of Dylan during a transitional time in the singer's career.]]

Jackson did some acting on Hollywood radio and recorded songs he learned at Pitchfork Ranch for [[Folkways Records]] during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="WPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllMusic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Jackson: Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/harry-jackson-mn0002116113|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|accessdate=May 6, 2016|first=Bruce|last=Eder}}&lt;/ref&gt; His album ''The Cowboy: His Songs, Ballads and Brag Talk'' was released in 1959.&lt;ref name=iTunes&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cowboy: His Songs, Ballads and Brag Talk|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cowboy-his-songs-ballads-brag/id157031506|publisher=[[iTunes Store]]|accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded for [[Columbia Records]] in New York during the 1960s,&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; and even sang at [[Carnegie Hall]] with Dylan and [[Joan Baez]],&lt;ref name="WPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StorrowAugust"/&gt; and [[Pete Seeger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rhoten|first1=Josh|title=February 9, 2014|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-35678162.html|accessdate=May 11, 2016|work=[[Wyoming Tribune Eagle]]|date=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His repertory included songs like "The Pot Wrassler" and "[[Streets of Laredo (song)|Streets of Laredo]]", and were "all sung in an authentic, unadorned style far removed from popular music or the folk-pop of the period".&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt;

In 1954, Jackson purchased a series of 1860 sketches by [[Paul Cézanne]] for $80 from someone at [[Aix-en-Provence]] who claimed that his father was the artist's caretaker. Jackson tried to sell them in 1962, but they were deemed stolen and confiscated after a [[Louvre]] seal was found during the authentication process. He fought for ownership of the sketches for five years and withdrew his claim in 1967. He said, "I was mad. Darn mad. But now I have come full circle and am returning the drawings, which is what I would have done immediately if the FBI had not taken the drawings and I had just been notified by Rewald."&lt;ref name="Saar"/&gt;

He began a private journal, which eventually grew to more than 100 volumes, in March 1945.&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt; Jackson's journal entry about meeting Pollock read:

{{quote|On Monday Oct 11, 1948, I finally met Jackson Pollock who became my friend and mentor who deeply influenced my entire life's work to this day. A few days after Jack and I bonded, my wild White Figure painting volcanically erupted from my sealed-off blacked-out mind. It was far too revealing, so I didn't show it to anyone until my exhaustive Retrospective at the University of Wyoming Art Museum in 1987.&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt;}}

The two were friends during Wayne's final decade of life.]]

According to some sources, Jackson was married and divorced as many as six times.&lt;ref name="Storrow"/&gt; However, his official biography on the Harry Jackson Studios website states that he was married four times.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Jackson Bio|url=http://www.harryjacksonstudios.com/harry-jackson-bio/|publisher=Harry Jackson Studios|accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his marriages was to abstract expressionist painter [[Grace Hartigan]], which lasted for a year.&lt;ref name="Storrow"/&gt;

After leaving New York, Jackson lived in Wyoming and [[Camaiore]], Italy, where he had a foundry and studio.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt; According to the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, Jackson also resided in Meeteetse and Lost Cabin, Wyoming in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt;

Jackson was reportedly "fiercely loyal to his friends" and often worked with others he deemed were "fellow mavericks".&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; He and John Wayne became friends in the final decade of Wayne's life.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt; In addition to the brain injuries inflicted during his military service, he was diagnosed with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and, according to his son, "treated everyday like a life and death battle".&lt;ref name="StorrowAugust"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Jackson died at the Veterans Health Administration's medical center in Sheridan on April 25, 2011 at the age of 87, following several health issues during his final year.&lt;ref name="Dies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt; He was survived by three sons, two daughters, and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt; His oldest son,&lt;ref name="StorrowAugust"/&gt; Matt, manages the Jackson collection and estate in Cody.&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; In August 2013, the [[Wyoming Arts Council]] began developing a plan to preserve Jackson's work, which included the participation of the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, Nicolaysen Art Museum, and the University of Wyoming Art Museum.&lt;ref name="StorrowAugust"/&gt; Matt continued efforts to fundraise the $5 million needed to maintain the collection and found an institution, and he also organized traveling exhibits to showcase his father's work.&lt;ref name="WPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; His goal was to keep the collection together, preferably within Wyoming,&lt;ref name="StorrowAugust"/&gt; but the trust had to begin selling pieces after no offers to fund the preservation of the entire collection were received.&lt;ref name="WPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Storrow"&gt;{{cite news|last=Storrow|first=Benjamin|title=2013 Look Back: What will become of Harry Jackson's art?|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/look-back-what-will-become-of-harry-jackson-s-art/article_d623cc55-27c7-543f-8c34-fe81837e4b39.html|accessdate=May 6, 2016|work=Casper Star-Tribune|date=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reno's Coeur d'Alene Art Auction sold a series of his artworks on July 23, 2011.&lt;ref name="Saar"/&gt;

In 2014, after spending three years assembling and surveying their father's work following his death, Jackson's children searched for an institution to house the collection of more than 5,000 drawings, paintings, and sculptures Jackson had stored and displayed in his home in Cody and foundry in Italy.&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; One of his sons, who serves as trustee of the Harry Jackson Trust, said: "Harry Jackson's body of work can only be fully examined now that he has passed away and stopped creating. The collection tells the full story of an unparalleled artist's life, and it's unlike any other ... [The collection is] something the art world has never had the chance to fully examine, and now that he is absent, we're learning so much more about his invaluable contribution to American art."&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; The collection also included brushes, home videos, photographs, props, reference books, tools, Jackson's business and personal records, and more than 100 volumes of his journals.&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt;

The Nicolaysen Art Museum exhibited ''The Big Picture: A Look at the Life and Art of Harry Jackson'' from May to August, 2014.&lt;ref name="Nicolaysen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Exhibitions|url=http://www.thenic.org/index.php?/exhibitions/C3|publisher=Nicolaysen Art Museum|accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Harry Jackson Studios exhibited ''Betio: Light and War'', which consists of 56 paintings, for the first time and in conjunction with the Buffalo Bill Center of the West "Rendezvous Royale" fundraiser.

Jackson became most known for his abstract art and paintings and bronze sculptures of cowboys and Indians.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCW"/&gt; He has also been credited for mastering the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax]] method of bronze casting and reviving [[polychrome sculpture]].&lt;ref name="Dies"/&gt;

In 1980, ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[Hilton Kramer]] said that Jackson's Western-inspired works were "unlike any other in the recent history of American art".&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StorrowAugust"/&gt; Furthermore, Kramer said that the evolution of Jackson's style "has turned a well-known and highly praised but penurious young artist into one of the wealthiest 'unknown' artists in America — an artist unknown, that is, to the art world where his first reputation was made 30 years ago."&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt; Jackson received the Wyoming Arts Council Governor's Arts Award in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cody's Harry Jackson got his start as Marine combat artist|url=http://wyoarts.state.wy.us/codys-harry-jackson-got-his-start-as-marine-combat-artist/|accessdate=May 9, 2016|date=July 16, 2010|publisher=[[Wyoming Arts Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jackson's obituary, ''The New York Times'' described him as an "artist who captured the West".&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; In 2013, ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' contributor Jordan Carlton Schaul described Jackson as the "preeminent Western artist of his time" and "one of the most distinguished American sculptors and painters in history".&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schaul|first=Jordan Carlton|title=Legacy of Harry Jackson: the Preeminent Sculptor &amp; Painter of the Wild West|journal=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|date=September 23, 2013|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/09/23/legacy-of-harry-jackson-the-preeminent-sculptor-painter-of-the-wild-west/|accessdate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyndon Johnson]], [[Gerald Ford]], and [[Ronald Reagan]] each appreciated and displayed Jackson's works, and selected his sculptures as gifts to heads of state.&lt;ref name="McLellan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; In 1976, Ford gave [[Queen Elizabeth II]] a sculpture called ''Two Champs'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All the Presidents, Ma'am; A Debut for Obamas but Smiling Queen Has Seen US First Families Come and Go|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-197078694.html|accessdate=May 11, 2016|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=April 4, 2009|location=London|oclc=223228477}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts [[Clayton Danks]] hanging onto Steamboat, the stallion from [[Bucking Horse and Rider]] seen on [[Vehicle registration plates of Wyoming|Wyoming's vehicle registration plates]], to celebrate the [[United States Bicentennial]].&lt;ref name="StorrowAugust"/&gt; Reagan kept eight bronzes in the [[White House]].&lt;ref name="Storrow"/&gt;

'''Helen Hall Jennings''' (September 20, 1905 – October 4, 1966) was a social psychologist and a pioneer in the field of [[social network]]s in the early 20th century. She developed quantitative research methods used to study [[sociometry]], a quantitative method for measuring social relationships. This work is cited as being the birth of social network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56137876|title=The Development of Social Network Analysis: A Study in the Sociology of Science.|last=Freeman|first=Linton C.|date=2004|publisher=Empirical Press|year=|isbn=1594577145|location=Vancouver, BC|pages=|oclc=56137876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Jennings graduated from the [[New Jersey College for Women]] (now known as the [[Douglass Residential College]] at [[Rutgers University]]) in 1927 with a [[Bachelor of Letters]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc2.ark:/13960/t8sb4s81p?urlappend=;seq=573|title=Catalogue.  v. 1930/1931 1897.|website=HathiTrust|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.b4525470|title=Columbia university alumni register, 1754-1931|last=|first=|date=1932|publisher=New York|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findingaids.cul.columbia.edu/ead/nnc-ua/ldpd_6386066/dsc/1|title=Columbia University Libraries Finding Aids: Columbia University Archives|website=findingaids.cul.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennings pursued her graduate degree in [[psychology]] at [[Columbia University]] and specialized in empirical research design. While working in the lab of psychologist [[Gardner Murphy]], she met [[Jacob L. Moreno]]. Through her knowledge of quantitative research methods and [[statistics]], Jennings worked with Moreno to develop an empirical approach to social network research. Together they studied how "social relations affected psychological well-being” and “used quantitative methods for studying the structure of groups and the positions of individuals within groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Network Analysis: History, Theory and Methodology|last= Prell|first= Christina|publisher= SAGE Publications|year= 2011|isbn= 1446290131|pages=22|oclc=761366968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennings and Moreno's research at [[Sing Sing]] and the [[New York Training School for Girls]] (also known as Hudson School for the Girls) "involved systematic data collection and analysis" and resulted in two published works: ''Application of the Group Method to Classification'' in 1932, and ''Who Shall Survive? A New Approach to the Problem of Human Interrelations'' in 1934.

In 1931, Jennings received her Master of Arts degree from [[Columbia University]]. Her master’s thesis was entitled "The nature of the pathetic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/4312148|title=The nature of the pathetic - CLIO|website=clio.columbia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time she was living in Stelton, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc2.ark:/13960/t8sb4s81p?urlappend=;seq=573|title=Catalogue.  v. 1930/1931 1897.|website=HathiTrust|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Jennings completed her PhD thesis ''Leadership and Isolation: A Study of Personality in Interpersonal Relations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1937047|title=Leadership and isolation, a study of personality in interpersonal relations - CLIO|website=clio.columbia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published by Longman, Greens, and Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leadership and Isolation: A Study of Personality in Interpersonal Relations|last= Jennings|first= Helen Hall|publisher= Longman, Greens, and Company.|year= 1943|location= New York|oclc= 751858}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Leadership and Isolation'' strove to examine how often-chosen leaders and isolates arise in a population. It was a continuation of analysis from the data collected at the New York Training School for Girls. Research subjects were asked who they would like to work with and who they would like to live with. Eight months later, there was little change in the selected leaders and isolates.

[[Benjamin Karpman]], a psychiatrist, reviewed the first edition of ''Leadership and Isolation'' for the ''[[Journal of Clinical Psychology]]''. In his review, he describes the importance of Jennings' research. Karpman closes his review encouraging all psychiatrists to read Jennings’ book, stating "it offers the most profound analysis of leadership and isolation in the social process this reviewer has discovered in the field of social psychology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Karpman|first1=Benjamin|date=April 1945|title=Jennings, Helen H.

A second edition of ''Leadership and Isolation'' was published by Longman, Greens, and Company in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leadership and Isolation: A Study of Personality in Interpersonal Relations|last= Jennings|first= Helen Hall|publisher= Longman, Greens, and Company.|year= 1950|location= New York|oclc= 217786}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morris Janowitz]], a founder of [[military sociology]], reviewed the book for the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''. In his review, Janowitz wrote that ''Leadership and Isolation'' "can be viewed as an ingenious empirical study which helped fashion sociometry as a research tool."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Janowitz|first1= Morris|date= July 1951|title= ''Leadership and Isolation: A Study of Personality in Interpersonal Relations''. Helen Hall Jennings|journal= American Journal of Sociology|volume= 51|issue= 1|pages= 84–85|doi= 10.1086/220864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to structural [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Linton Freeman|Linton C. Freeman]], the empirical methods developed by Jennings and applied in Moreno’s sociometry studies laid the groundwork for future social network research: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Clearly, with a great deal of help from Jennings and Lazarsfeld, Moreno had developed an approach that included all of the defining properties of social network analysis. It was based on structural intuitions, it involved the collection of systematic empirical data, graphic imagery was an integral part of its tools and it embodied an explicit mathematical model. That structural perspective, moreover, was generalized to a range of phenomena. Thus, the group led by Moreno displayed all four of the features that define social network analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Development of Social Network Analysis: A Study in the Sociology of Science|last=Freeman|first=Linton C.|publisher=Empirical Press|year=2004|isbn=1594577145|location=Vancouver, BC|pages=39|oclc=56137876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Freeman draws the conclusion that Jennings was instrumental in the empirical research done in support of theories from Moreno:&lt;blockquote&gt;"My own suspicion is that Jennings's contributions were immense. Moreno had no research training at all, and until this point, he had shown absolutely no interest in systematic research. All of his earlier publications were couched in heavy mysticism. But his newer works–those produced during his collaboration with Jennings–were comparatively systematic and were, for the first time, empirically grounded. The obvious conclusion is that, though the intuitive ideas came from Moreno, the completed research and the publications drew heavily on the contributions of Jennings. Jennings, it seems, was not only a collaborator but she was, in Moreno's terms, a very powerful 'muse.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Development of Social Network Analysis: A Study in the Sociology of Science|last=Freeman|first=Linton C.|publisher=Empirical Press|year=2004|isbn=1594577145|location=Vancouver, BC|pages=36|oclc=56137876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Helge Palmcrantz''' (1842–1880), [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[inventor]] and [[industrialist]], was born in [[Hammerdal]], in the province of [[Jämtland]], the son of a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] in the [[Jämtland Ranger Regiment]]. He was enlisted as a cadet in his father's [[regiment]], where he worked on [[Topographic surveying and mapping|land survey]]. After a couple of years he left the regiment to study at the Technological Institute of Stockholm (later known as [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH]]).

In partnership with his brother-in-law, [[Theodor Winborg]], Palmcrantz founded a small [[workshop]] on Vollmar Yxkullsgatan 25, [[Södermalm]], [[Stockholm]]. As number of employees increased along with the production volume, he moved to a new [[factory]] on [[Kungsholmen]], [[Stockholm]], where they manufactured [[firearms]], [[reaping machine]]s, [[mower]]s and other [[agricultural]] equipment of their own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The Commissioners of patents' journal |chapter = patent 2309|publisher= Great Britain. Patent Office |year=1876 |page=2153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on there would be Palmcrantz &amp; Co factory on [[Lövholmen]], [[Stockholm]] as well; later called [[Palmcrantzska Fabriken]].

In 1868, the first version of his machine-gun was finished and a demonstration of its capacity was held on [[Ladugårdsgärdet]], [[Stockholm]] in front of the Swedish Defense Minister; G.R. Abel. After a couple of modifications and improvements, he patented the multi-barrel, lever-actuated, [[machine gun]] and it was bought into the Swedish army as [[Kulspruta m/1873]]. Same year, the machine-gun was shown on the [[1873 Vienna World's Fair]]. To reach international success, Palmcrantz met Nordenfelt in 1875 and the latter's company became his British agent. They agreed to market the [[machine-gun]] under the then well known Nordenfelt brand and his second model [[kulspruta m/1875]] would later be known as the ''[[Nordenfelt gun|Nordenfelt machine-gun]]'' after his financial backer, [[Thorsten Nordenfelt]]. . It was Nordenfelt who convinced Palmcrantz to increase the [[caliber]] of his [[gun]] to one inch, making it a suitable [[weapon]] for use against the growing threat of [[torpedo boat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Machine Gun: The Story of the Men and the Weapon That Changed the Face of War |first=Anthony |last=Smith| publisher= Macmillan|year= 2004 |page=69|ISBN = 978-0-312-93477-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Palmcrantz succumbed to an early death from a bleeding [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]], Winborg and Nordenfelt continued to develop and manufacture his guns in [[Sweden]], [[England]] and [[Spain]].

Helge Palmcrantz has a school named after him; [[Palmcrantzskolan]] in [[Östersund]]. The block names "Kulsprutan" and "Lavetten" on Kungsholmen is named after his factories at Hantverkargatan.

'''Ihab Amir''' ({{lang-ar|اهاب امير}}) is a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]], [[composer]] and [[guitarist]]. Born in 1994 in [[Safi, Morocco]] on the 14th of May, he rose to popularity as a contestant in the 11th season of ''[[Star Academy Arab World]]''. He made his commercial singing debut with two songs, "Nta li Bditi" ({{lang-ar|نتا لي بديتي}}) and "Taali Lia" ({{lang-ar|تعالي ليا}}), in July 2015.

==Star Academy 11==

Amir competed in the 11th season of [[Star Academy Arab World]]. He was the second Moroccan male ever to be accepted on to the show. Ihab won people's hearts from the get go, mainly due to his pride in showcasing the Moroccan dialect with the other candidates. Amir was never named by any of the show's judges for nomination up until the week of his exit when he was finally named a nominee. Amir was nominated only once on the show. During this nomination he was shown to have lost the public vote, which raised allegations that the show tampered with the results. Fans of Amir expressed their outrage through social media 01/01/2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldakhbar.com/culture-art/celebrity/45711.html|title=خروج المتسابق المغربي إهاب أمير من البرايم ال12 في ستار اكاديمي - اخبار - العالم اليوم|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310220516/http://www.worldakhbar.com/culture-art/celebrity/45711.html|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabic.cnn.com/world/2016/01/04/star-academy-moroccan-participant|title=CNN Arabic - حالات إغماء وضجة في المطار إبّان استقبال متسابق مغربي أٌقصي من "ستار أكاديمي"|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Return to Morocco==
After Ihab Amir's exclusion from the show, his fans were ready to welcome him in the airport of [[Casablanca]]. though it was a shock for all the Moroccans and the Arabs to see this huge number of fans in the airport for a candidate that was excluded from the show on his first nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telquel.ma/2016/01/22/donc-ihab-nouveau-justin-bieber-marocain_1479046|title=Mais qui est donc Ihab Amir, le nouveau Justin Bieber marocain ?|date=22 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slaati.com/2016/01/05/p453065.html|title=بالفيديو.. حالات اغماء في المغرب بعد عودة ايهاب امير وخروجه من ستار اكاديمي|date=5 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his arrival to Morocco the fans made him a huge welcoming not only in the airport but also in his city [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]] that lasted for a whole day and all the fans from other countries watched it from his [[Periscope]],  it was the talk of the press in the whole Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala7dath.com/2015/12/03/%d8%a5%d9%8a%d9%87%d8%a7%d8%a8-%d8%a3%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%b1-%d8%a5%d8%a8%d9%86-%d9%85%d8%af%d9%8a%d9%86%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d8%b3%d9%81%d9%8a-%d9%88-%d9%86%d8%ac%d9%85-%d8%b3%d8%aa%d8%a7%d8%b1-%d8%a3%d9%83%d8%a7/|title=إيهاب أمير إبن مدينة اسفي و نجم ستار أكاديمي - الأحداث أسفي|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this fame that was acquired in a very short time many Radio and TV channels invited Ihab for interviews such as [[Hit Radio (Morocco)|Hit Radio]], Chada FM, [[2M TV|2M]] and [[Medi 1 TV]] the latter made a report about his debut.

==His career after the academy==

During his interviews Amir talked about his new song that carry the title of "Célibataire" which means "single" in French language and he explained how he is working on his first video clip, not to mention that the song was already out since he made it while he was in the academy and the fans already put it in a [[Youtube]] channel and it gain more than one million views in a very short period. Ihab also add that he will attend the musical academy in [[Casablanca]] since he think he still need to learn more about music in order to fulfill his dream.

'''James Edward Oberg''' (born November 7, 1944), often known as '''Jim Oberg''', is an American space [[journalist]] and [[historian]], regarded as an expert on the [[Russian space program|Russian]] and [[Chinese space program]]s.&lt;ref name="omni"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.debunker.com/texts/soviet.html|title = Soviet Saucers|last = Oberg|first = James|date = April 1994|work = [[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]|publisher = General Media, Inc.|accessdate = June 23, 2009|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090207104956/http://debunker.com/texts/soviet.html|archivedate = February 7, 2009|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/Catscan_columns/catscan.14|title = Catscan 14: 'Memories of the Space Age'|last = Sterling|first = Bruce|authorlink = Bruce Sterling|work = [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|quote = Oberg is a recognized Soviet Space expert, sometime NOVA host on PBS, special consultant to the Sotheby's auction house for Soviet space memorabilia, and the author of the definitive tome RED STAR IN ORBIT (Random House 1981).|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091004115836/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/Catscan_columns/catscan.14|archivedate = 2009-10-04|df = }} Catscan archive homepage [http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/Catscan_columns/ here.]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004095737/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/Catscan_columns/ |date=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a 22-year career as a space engineer in [[NASA]] specializing in [[Space rendezvous|orbital rendezvous]]. Oberg is an author of ten books and more than a thousand articles on space flight. He gave many explanations of [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] phenomena in the popular press. He is also a consultant in spaceflight operations and safety.

== Early life and education ==
James Oberg was born in [[New York City]] on November 7, 1944.&lt;ref name = "JOCons"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Oberg|first1 = James|title = U.S./Russian Aerospace Consultancies|url = http://www.jamesoberg.com/resumeconsultancies.html|website = JamesOberg.com|accessdate = 2016-08-01|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160331100926/http://jamesoberg.com/resumeconsultancies.html|archivedate = 2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Mathematics]] from [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in 1966, a [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in [[Applied Mathematics]] ([[Orbital mechanics|Astrodynamics]]) from [[Northwestern University]] in 1969 (where he was also a NASA Trainee&lt;ref name = "JOProfile"/&gt;) and a M.S. in [[Computer Science]] from [[University of New Mexico]] in 1972.&lt;ref name = "JOCons"/&gt;

== US Air Force ==
At Northwestern University he started [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] work in Mathematics, but was called to active duty by the [[United States Air Force]] in 1970.&lt;ref name = "JOJourn"/&gt; There he worked with modeling [[laser]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s&lt;ref name = "JOJourn"/&gt; and in the years 1972–1975, while working in the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] Computer Institute, he helped design and test [[ARPANET]], ancestor of the Internet.&lt;ref name = "JOAerospace"/&gt;

== NASA ==
After service in the [[United States Air Force]], he joined [[NASA]] in 1975, where he worked until 1997&lt;ref name = "JOProfile"/&gt; at [[Johnson Space Center]] on the [[Space Shuttle program]]. He worked in the [[Mission Control Center]] for several [[Space Shuttle]] missions from [[STS-1]] on, specializing in [[Space rendezvous|orbital rendezvous]] techniques. This culminated in planning the orbit for the [[STS-88]] mission,&lt;ref name = "JOAerospace"/&gt; the first [[International Space Station]] (ISS) assembly flight.

During the 1990s, he was involved in NASA studies of the [[Soviet space program]], with particular emphasis on safety aspects;&lt;ref name = "JOAerospace"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Oberg|first1 = James|title = Aerospace Career Specialities|url = http://www.jamesoberg.com/resumeaerospace.html|website = JamesOberg.com|accessdate = 2016-08-02|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160331035215/http://jamesoberg.com/resumeaerospace.html|archivedate = 2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; these had often been covered up or downplayed, and with the advent of the ISS and the [[Shuttle–Mir Program|Shuttle–''Mir'']] programs, NASA was keen to study them as much as possible. He privately published several books on the Soviet (and later Russian) programs, and became one of the few Western specialists on Russian space history.

He has often been called to testify before the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] on the Russian space program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.houstonspacesociety.org/ist/oberg.html|title = Testimony of James Oberg|date = October 7, 1998|work = In Space Today|publisher = Houston Space Society|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990505182605/http://houstonspacesociety.org/ist/oberg.html|archivedate = May 5, 1999|accessdate = May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 he voluntarily resigned from NASA and started a full-time free-lance career.&lt;ref name = "JOFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Oberg|first1 = James|title = FAQ|url = http://www.jamesoberg.com/faq.html|website = JamesOberg.com|accessdate = 2016-08-02|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160505164235/http://www.jamesoberg.com/faq.html|archivedate = 2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently he works as a consultant in spaceflight operations and safety and as a space journalist.&lt;ref name = "JOFAQ"/&gt;

== Author and journalist ==
As a journalist, Oberg writes for several publications, mostly online; he was previously a space correspondent or commentator for [[United Press International|UPI]], [[ABC News]] and currently [[MSNBC]],&lt;ref name = "JOProfile"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Oberg|first1 = James|title = Profile|url = http://www.jamesoberg.com/profile.html|website = JamesOberg.com|accessdate = 2016-08-02|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160505164742/http://www.jamesoberg.com/profile.html|archivedate = 2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; often in an on-air role. He is a Fellow of the skeptical organization [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]]&lt;ref name = "JOCons"/&gt; and a consultant to its magazine ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''.

He authored more than a thousand magazine and newspaper articles,&lt;ref name = "JOCons"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "JOProfile"/&gt; including such magazines as ''[[The Wall Street Journal]], [[USA Today]], [[Scientific American]], [[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]], [[Popular Science]], [[Popular Mechanics]], [[New Scientist]], [[IEEE Spectrum]], Air Force Magazine, Star and Sky'', etc.&lt;ref name = "JOJourn"/&gt;

Oberg is also a space consultant and on-air commentator to [[NBC News]], [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Canada]] and the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name = "JOJourn"/&gt;

In December 1990, ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'', a British television science and philosophy television documentary program, aired a three-part series, "Red Star in Orbit," based on Oberg's book of the same name. [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] adapted the ''Horizon'' series for its ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' television science series, a three-part [[miniseries]] titled "The Russian Right Stuff," which aired in February 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/listseason/18.html|title = NOVA : Past Television Programs : Season 18: January–December 1991 : PBS|work = PBS Online|publisher = [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]|location = Boston, MA|accessdate = May 12, 2013|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131001184522/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/listseason/18.html|archivedate = October 1, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HBO]] has optioned ''Red Star in Orbit'' for a future production. Also in 1991, Oberg launched a battle for official recognition of [[Robert Henry Lawrence, Jr.]] (1935–1967) as a United States [[astronaut]];&lt;ref name = GSW195/&gt; the [[United States Air Force]] officially recognized Lawrence in January 1997, six years after Oberg had begun his campaign.&lt;ref name = GSW195&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Gubert|first1 = Betty Kaplan|last2 = Sawyer|first2 = Miriam|last3 = Fannin|first3 = Caroline M.|title = Distinguished African Americans in Aviation and Space Science|date = 2001|publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Oryx Press]]|location = Westport, CT|isbn = 978-1-57356-246-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Oberg authored ''Space Power Theory'', sponsored by [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]]&lt;ref name = H251&gt;{{cite book|last = Handberg|first = Roger|title = Seeking New World Vistas: The Militarization of Space|date = 2000|publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger Publishers]]|location = Westport, CT|isbn = 978-0-275-96295-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a part of an official campaign in changing perceptions of [[space warfare]], specifically deployment and use of weapons in outer space, and its political implications.&lt;ref name = H251/&gt; "In Oberg's view, space is not an extension of air warfare but is unique in itself."&lt;ref name = H251/&gt;

James Oberg is an author of ten books&lt;ref name = "JOCons"/&gt; in addition to several technical NASA publications.&lt;ref name = "JOBooksNASA"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Oberg|first1 = James|title = Books – NASA|url = http://www.jamesoberg.com/nasa.html|website = JamesOberg.com|accessdate = 2016-08-03|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160328135037/http://jamesoberg.com/nasa.html|archivedate = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote encyclopedia articles on space exploration in the ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]], [[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica]]'' yearbook, ''[[Grolier]]'' and ''[[Academic American Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref name = "JOCons"/&gt;

== Moon landing conspiracies ==
[[File:Apollo 11 Crew During Training Exercise - GPN-2002-000032.jpg|thumb|One of the photos taken during a simulation used by conspiracy theorists]]
Oberg was commissioned by NASA to write a [[rebuttal]] of [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[Moon landing conspiracy theories]]. However, NASA dropped the project after [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s World News Tonight program ran a story about it, claiming it was beneath NASA's dignity to respond to Moon landing [[Denialism|denialists]] claims.&lt;ref name=FMoon/&gt; Oberg has said that he still intends to pursue the project, "depending on successfully arranging new funding sources."&lt;ref name=FMoon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oberg|first=James|date=March–April 2003|title=Lessons of the 'Fake Moon Flight' Myth|journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|location=Amherst, NY|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|pages=23, 30|accessdate=April 27, 2013|url=http://www.jamesoberg.com/042003lessonsfake_his.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624135823/http://www.jamesoberg.com/042003lessonsfake_his.html|archivedate=June 24, 2013|df=}} Reprinted in [[Kendrick Frazier|Frazier, Kendrick]] (ed.) (2009). ''Science Under Siege: Defending Science, Exposing Pseudoscience''. Amherst, NY: [[Prometheus Books]]. {{ISBN|978-1-59102-715-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2424927.stm|accessdate=August 26, 2009|title=Nasa pulls Moon hoax book|date=November 8, 2002|first=David|last=Whitehouse|work=BBC News|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203053109/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2424927.stm|archivedate=February 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oberg writes that Moon landing conspiracy theories are fueled by resentment of American culture by some countries. He gives the example of [[Cuba]], where many school teachers claim the landing was a fraud.&lt;ref name=FMoon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Getting Apollo 11 Right|first=James|last=Oberg|authorlink=James Oberg|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC2000/abc2000science/oberg2000.html|accessdate=August 13, 2009|work=ABC News|publisher=ABC|location=New York|date=July 1999|quote=I'm told that this is official dogma still taught in schools in Cuba, plus wherever else Cuban teachers have been sent (such as [[Sandinista]] Nicaragua and Angola).|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402094521/http://abcnews.go.com/ABC2000/abc2000science/oberg2000.html|archivedate=April 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; But besides this, the new wave of conspiracy theorists appear to use alternative publication methods to publicize their claims.

Oberg says that belief in the conspiracy is not the fault of the hoaxists, but rather of educators and people (including NASA) who should provide information to the public.&lt;ref name=FMoon/&gt; NASA does not, in Oberg's opinion, provide an adequate reaction to the theorists' claims.

== North Korean satellite launch inspection ==
[[File:North Korean Unha-3 rocket at launch pad.jpg|thumb|North Korean Unha-3 space rocket]]
In April 2012 Oberg traveled to [[North Korea]] as a NBC space consultant&lt;ref name="Oberg 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47204491/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/what-we-learned-north-koreas-rocket-no-show/|title=What we learned from North Korea's rocket no-show|last=Oberg|first=James|date=2012-04-27|website=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=2016-08-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928001442/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47204491/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/what-we-learned-north-koreas-rocket-no-show/|archivedate=2016-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to observe the launching of the [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3]] satellite and determine whether it is a military launch. Together with a team of journalists&lt;ref&gt;[[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3#Media coverage]]&lt;/ref&gt; he inspected the [[Sohae Satellite Launching Station]], the [[Unha]] rocket and the satellite. According to Oberg, North Korea "showed everything but the important things"&lt;ref name="space_review_nkorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2262/1|title=Using "rocket science" to understand North Korea's space and missile efforts|last=Oberg|first=James|date=2012-12-03|newspaper=[[The Space Review]]|accessdate=2016-08-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914185744/http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2262/1|archivedate=2016-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not manage to demonstrate peaceful intent.

== UFO investigation ==
James Oberg often writes about alleged [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] sightings, giving scientific explanations to seemingly [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] phenomena, or otherwise debunking them as hoaxes.

Oberg categorized UFO sightings (excluding those identified as hoaxes) into one of three groups:&lt;ref name = "atlasobscura"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Giaimo|first1 = Cara|title = How One Man Has Explained Almost Every Internet UFO Theory|url = http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-one-man-has-explained-almost-every-internet-ufo-theory|website = Atlas Obscura|accessdate = 2016-08-04|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160804110917/http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-one-man-has-explained-almost-every-internet-ufo-theory|archivedate = 2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Pavlou|first1 = George|title = Former NASA Employee Explains Almost Every UFO Sighting|url = http://www.theladbible.com/more/interesting-former-nasa-employee-explains-almost-every-ufo-sighting-20160608|website = The LAD bible|accessdate = 2016-08-04|date = 2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mailonline 2016"&gt;{{cite web|title = Former Nasa employee explains what's REALLY behind conspiracy theories|website = Mail Online|date = 2016-06-07|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3628974/UFO-sightings-debunked-Former-Nasa-employee-explains-s-REALLY-popular-alien-conspiracies-theories.html|accessdate = 2016-08-04|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20160615023048/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3628974/UFO-sightings-debunked-Former-Nasa-employee-explains-s-REALLY-popular-alien-conspiracies-theories.html|archivedate = 2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InqUFO"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Didymus|first1 = Johnthomas|title = UFOs debunked?

# ''Super-High Plumes'' – rocket or missile plumes, especially lit by the sun on a dark sky;
# ''Space "Dandruff"'' – ice flakes, fragments of insulation, etc. flying alongside a space vehicle, especially seen by backward-facing cameras;
# ''Twilight Shadowing'' – objects that move from shadow into sunlight in space appear as if coming from behind the clouds or from beyond the edge of the Earth.

James Oberg wrote several articles as a publicity campaign to remove guns from the ISS.&lt;ref name = "NBC_guns"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Oberg|first1 = James|title = Russia has the corner on guns in space|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23131359/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/russia-has-corner-guns-space/|website = NBC news|accessdate = 2016-08-08|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160316151418/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23131359/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/russia-has-corner-guns-space/|archivedate = 2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "JObergGun"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Oberg|first1 = James|title = The Russian Gun at the International Space Station|url = http://www.jamesoberg.com/russiangun_tec.html|website = JamesOberg.com|accessdate = 2016-08-08|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160310105739/http://www.jamesoberg.com/russiangun_tec.html|archivedate = 2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[TP-82 Cosmonaut survival pistol]] was stowed in the [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] emergency landing survival kit and was added there for hunting and self-defense after landing in inhospitable environment. It had three barrels and a folding stock that doubled as a [[shovel]] and contained a [[machete]]. The gun was only carried by Russian members of the ISS. Oberg suggested that it might be an invitation to a future disaster and proposed it to be put in a compartment accessible only from outside, after landing.

In 2014 Oberg asked [[Samantha Cristoforetti]], an Italian ISS astronaut, about the pistol and she admitted the gun is removed from the list, or more precisely, it is still on the official list of kit contents, but the committee meets before every mission to review the list and vote to remove the pistol for the specific flight.&lt;ref name = "Spectrum_guns"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Oberg|first1 = James|title = How I Stopped Cosmonauts From Carrying Guns|url = http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/how-i-stop-cosmonauts-carrying-guns|website = IEEE SPECTRUM|accessdate = 2016-08-08|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160415193637/http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/how-i-stop-cosmonauts-carrying-guns|archivedate = 2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Greer is married to Dean E.

Greer grew up Catholic, although at the age of ten she convinced her parents to let her go to a Presbyterian church, claiming that she thought she would be closer to God there. The real reason was that she thought there were cuter boys at that church.&lt;ref name="colbert2017"/&gt; During a 2014 interview, Greer stated that she is no longer a practicing Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interviewly.com/i/judy-greer-apr-2014-reddit|title=Interviewly -Judy Greer April 2014 - reddit AMA|work=Interviewly|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, she told ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', "I had been wanting to try and learn how to meditate, and I did research on the different types of meditation. [[Transcendental Meditation technique|TM]] seemed the easiest, and I liked that it wasn't religious in any way."&lt;ref name=glam&gt;{{cite web|last=Radloff|first=Jessica|title=Judy Greer Has the Perfect Solution for Coping With Stress in Her New AOL Short|url=http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2014/05/judy-greer-has-the-perfect-sol.html|accessdate=14 May 2014|quote=Greer is adding director to her resume as she showcases why Transcendental Meditation has become such a huge part of her life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of '''last [[:wikt:scion|scion]]s''' or '''individuals who were the last member of a ruling house''', or other prominent family, where heredity is the prime form of inheritance. This may be the last person to rule a realm, sometimes leading to a political crisis, or a change in government; other times power has already passed from the patrilineal family, leaving it in a less important position when it reaches its extinction.

==House of Aviz==
The [[House of Aviz]], an illegitimate branch of its predecessor the [[House of Burgundy]], ruled Portugal from 1385 to 1580; its last member was ''[[Henry, King of Portugal|Henrique, Cardinal-King of Portugal]]'' (1512–1580), who succeeded his grand-nephew [[Sebastian of Portugal|King Sebastian]] late in life. [[António, Prior of Crato]] would briefly rule Portugal shortly thereafter, but his illegitimate birth contests his claim to be considered a member of the House of Aviz.

==House of Bourbon (main line)==
The main line of the [[House of Bourbon]], which had ruled France from 1589 to 1793 and from 1814 to 1830, became extinct with the death of ''[[Henri, comte de Chambord]]'' (1820–1883), grandson of [[Charles X of France|King Charles X]]. The comte de Chambord was the last male-line descendant of [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]], but many other lines of the house survive, including the [[Spanish Royal Family]], the [[Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg]], and pretenders to the thrones of numerous other European thrones, all descending from [[Henry IV of France]] and ultimately from [[Hugh Capet]] of the [[House of Capet]].

==House of Bruce==
The [[Clan Bruce]] ruled Scotland from 1306 to 1371. Its last royal member was ''[[David II of Scotland|King David II]]'' (1324–1371), upon whose death without issue the throne passed to his nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert Stewart]]. The Clan continues today through other lines that do not have patrilineal royal ancestry, although the current clan chief, [[Andrew Bruce, 11th Earl of Elgin]], is descended from [[Robert I of Scotland|King Robert Bruce]] in the female line.

==&lt;nowiki/&gt;House of Burgundy (Portuguese branch)==
A branch of the [[House of Burgundy]], itself a branch of the [[House of Capet]], was the first ruling house of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] in 1139. Its last male member was ''[[Ferdinand I of Portugal|King Ferdinand I]]'' (1345–1383), whose daughter ''[[Beatrice of Portugal|Beatrice]]'' (1372–1408) was the disputed queen for two years, as well as [[List of Castilian consorts|queen of Castile and León by marriage]]. Instead Ferdinand's illegitimate half-brother [[John I of Portugal|John, Grand Master of the Order of Aviz]] became king, forming the [[House of Aviz]].

==House of Dunkeld==
The last member of the [[House of Dunkeld]] was ''[[Alexander III of Scotland|King Alexander III]]'' (1241–1286), ending the family's rule over Scotland that had persisted since 1058. Alexander, the last male-line descendant of [[Duncan I of Scotland|King Donnchad I]], who ruled from 1034 to 1040, outlived his own children, leaving only his granddaughter (though his daughter) [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] as heir; her death a few years later plunged Scotland into an interregnum.

==House of Habsburg==
Male members of the [[House of Habsburg]] held many regnal titles in Europe from the twelfth to eighteenth centuries, most importantly those of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (and its German associate and [[predecessor state|predecessor titles]]) and [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]]. Its last male scion was ''[[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]]'' (1685–1740). His daughter ''[[Maria Theresa of Austria]]'' (1717–1780), who succeeded to some of her father's titles by inheritance and gained power of the rest of her father's domains when her husband was elected Emperor, was the last member of the royal house. Her descendants, the [[House of Lorraine]], continued to hold this power and were styled the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

==House of Lancaster==
The [[House of Lancaster]] or Lancaster branch of the [[House of Plantagenet]] ruled England from 1399 to 1461 and again briefly in 1470-1471; its last scion was ''[[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]]'', who outlived his only son [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]]. Henry VI also had [[English claims to the French throne|claims to the French throne]] through the parentage of his mother [[Catherine of Valois]] and the conquests of his father [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]].
See also ''[[#Houses of Plantagenet and York|House of Plantagenet]]''.

==House of Luxembourg==
Long before the present [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] was established, the [[House of Luxembourg]] was a powerful family in Germany, supplying several [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. The last of these was ''[[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]'' (1368–1437), also [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Bohemia|Bohemia]]. His daughter ''[[Elisabeth of Bohemia (1409–1442)]]'' survived him to become the last Luxembourg family monarch, ruling Hungary and Bohemia and also as [[german Queen|German queen consort]]. A non-imperial branch of the House descended from [[Henry V, Count of Luxembourg]] ruled as French nobles until the death of [[Charles II, Duke of Brienne]] in 1608.

==House of Orange-Nassau==
The [[House of Orange-Nassau]], which had ruled before the Napoleonic Wars as [[Prince of Orange|Princes of Orange]], served as [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Kings of the Netherlands]] and [[List of Grand Dukes of Luxembourg|Grand Dukes of Luxembourg]] from 1815. [[King-Grand Duke]] ''[[William III of the Netherlands|William III]]'' (1817–1890), who outlived his three sons, was the last male member of the house and the last person to rule both countries; his daughter ''[[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]]'' (1880–1962) succeeded him as Queen, while Luxembourg passed to the [[House of Nassau-Weilburg]]. The house became totally extinct in the male line with Wilhelmina's death, but the name is still used by her descendants, who continue to rule.

==Houses of Plantagenet and York==
The last male member of the [[House of Plantagenet]], which ruled England from 1154 to 1485 and had fluctuating control over parts of [[France]], was ''[[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]]'' (1475–1499), a nephew of [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]] and great-great-grandson of [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]]. His uncle [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]] had been killed and replaced by [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], who started his own royal dynasty and eventually had Warwick executed. The last legitimate male-line descendant of [[Henry II of England]], first Plantagenet king, was Warwick's sister ''[[Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury]]'' (1473–1541), who was executed by Henry Tudor's son [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]].

As descendants of the earliest [[Duke of York|Dukes of York]], Edward and Margaret may also be considered the last scions of the [[House of York]] or York branch of the House of Plantagenet, which ruled England specifically from 1461 to 1485 (with a brief pause in 1470-1471).

==House of Stuart==
The last member of the [[House of Stuart]] was ''[[Henry Benedict Stuart]]'' (1725–1807), a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]. He was the last legitimate male-line descendant of [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]], who became [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scots]] in 1371. The House of Stuart had ruled [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] since then and [[Kingdom of England|England]] since 1603, replaced temporarily from 1649 to 1660 by the [[Covenanter]]s and permanently in 1714 when [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] died without surviving children, although Henry Cardinal Stuart's grandfather [[James II of England|King James II &amp; VII]] had been dethroned in 1688 during the [[Glorious Revolution]]. The headship of the house is usually associated today with [[Franz, Duke of Bavaria]] of the [[House of Wittelsbach]], the senior heir-general of James II &amp; VII's sister [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|Henrietta Anna, Duchess of Orléans]]. Non-royal branches of the family still survive. The [[Earl of Galloway|Earls of Galloway]] are the senior surviving line of the Stuarts, they descend from a line which originated from the second son of [[Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland]].

==House of Tudor==
The last male member of the [[Tudor dynasty|House of Tudor]], which had ruled England since 1485, was ''[[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]]'' (1537–1553). His half-sister ''[[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]'' (1533–1603) took the throne in 1558 and ruled until her death, when the [[House of Stuart]] came to the throne in the person of [[James I of England|King James VI of Scotland]].

==House of York==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13686">This is a '''list of people who remarried each other''', usually after divorcing.

To qualify, at least one member of each marital pair must be considered notable enough to have their own Wikipedia page.

Of particular note are:
* [[Kid McCoy]], American prize fighter, who married and divorced ten times, but only from eight women, since '''three''' of those marriages were to the same spouse, Julia Woodruff
* [[Richard Pryor]], American comedian and actor, who was twice divorced from both Jennifer Lee and Flynn Belaine 
* Joyce Mathews, American actress, who was twice divorced from both [[Milton Berle]] and [[Billy Rose]]

'''Mahjoub Tobji''' ({{lang-ar|محجوب الطوبجي}}, born 1942 in [[Meknes]]) is a retired [[Commandant (rank)|Commandant]] of the [[Royal Moroccan Army]]. He commanded a battalion of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] soldiers during the [[Western Sahara war]] and was the [[Aide-de-camp]] of General [[Ahmed Dlimi]]. Upon the death of the latter he was arbitrarily detained during 20 months and was able escape prison and fled to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language = fr|title = Détenu depuis vingt mois, l'ancien aide de camp du général Dlimi s'est évadé de sa prison|url = http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1984/10/11/detenu-depuis-vingt-mois-l-ancien-aide-de-camp-du-general-dlimi-s-est-evade-de-sa-prison_3136438_1819218.html|journal = [[Le Monde]]|date= 11 October 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went back to Morocco after he succeeded in meeting [[Hassan II]] during his vacations in France at the Hotel Le Crillon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Les Officiers de Sa Majesté|date=2006|author=Mahjoub Tobji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he wrote a book ''({{lang-fr|Les Officiers de Sa Majesté}})'' about the Moroccan army and its operations during deployments in the [[Yom Kippur war]] and Western Sahara. In this book he singled out General [[Housni Benslimane]] as the most powerful man in Morocco, responsible for his imprisonment and other exactions against Moroccan dissidents which were blamed on [[Driss Basri]].&lt;ref name=tq&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahmed Dlimi.

After the publication of his book, he faced some intimidations in his exile in France. His pension was abruptly stopped in late 2012, and was only re-established after he went on a hunger-strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ghita Ismaili|title=France : Mahjoub Tobji, l’ancien militaire marocain, arrête sa grève de la faim|url=http://www.yabiladi.com/articles/details/17543/france-mahjoub-tobji-l-ancien-militaire.html|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Yabiladi|date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maria Josepha Hermengilde Esterházy de Galantha''' (born '''von Liechtenstein''', 13 April, 1768 — 8 August, 1845) was the daughter of [[Franz Josef I of Liechtenstein]]. On 15 September 1783 she married Prince [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterházy|Nikolaus II Esterházy de Galantha]], who in 1794 became the Prince of [[Esterházy]]. In 1785 she bore a son, [[Paul III Anton, Prince Esterházy|Paul Anton]] and in 1788 a daughter, Leopoldine.

==Patroness==
Like her husband Maria was a patron of artists, and especially of [[Joseph Haydn]], who from 1796 to 1802 was commissioned to write a yearly [[Mass (music)|Mass]] to be performed on her [[nameday]] (8 September, the [[Nativity of Mary|Nativity of the BVM]]&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Masses by Joseph Haydn]] gives the more plausible Sept. 12, [[The Most Holy Name of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]
&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus originated the ''[[Heiligmesse]]'' (1796), ''[[Paukenmesse]]'' (1797), ''[[Missa in Angustiis|Nelsonmesse]]'' (1798), ''[[Theresienmesse]]'' (1799), ''[[Schöpfungsmesse]]'' (1801) and ''[[Harmoniemesse]]'' (1802). For her 1807 nameday  [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] composed his ''[[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|''Mass in C major, op. 86'']].

[[Canonization|Blessed]] '''Thresia Chiramel Mankidiyan''' (usually known as '''Mariam Thresia'''; 26 April 1876 – 8 June 1926) was an [[Indian people|Indian]] [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syro-Malabar]] [[Nun|professed religious]] and the founder of the Congregation of the Holy Family.&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-mariam-thresia-chiramel-mankidiyan/|title=Blessed Mariam Thresia Chiramel Mankidiyan|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=4 June 2016|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thresia Mankidiyan became known for receiving frequent visions and ecstasies as well as even receiving the [[stigmata]] which she kept well-guarded.

Mariam Thresia|date=|publisher=Bl. Mariam Thresia|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II]] beatified the late nun on 9 April 2000.

==Life speech==

Thresia Chiramel Mankidiyan was born in [[Puthenchira]] in the [[Thrissur district]] on 26 April 1876 as the third of five children of Thoma and Thanda and was later [[baptized]] on 3 May 1876 at the church of Saint Mary; she was named in honor of [[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa of Ávila]]. Her paternal uncle Antony Chiramel Mankidiyan was her godfather and his wife Anna was the godmother. Her family was once rich though became poor when her grandfather married off seven daughters after selling property for each costly dowry; this led to her brothers and her father taking up drinking.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; Her mother was her father's second wife; her father's first wife Mariamkutty died during childbirth in 1872.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; She had two sisters and two brothers and were in exact order: Porinchu, Mariamkutty, Ouseph and Ittianam - she was born in between Mariamkutty and Ouseph.

In 1884 her mother tried in vain to dissuade the pious girl from her severe fasts and night vigils. Her mother died on 2 March 1888 after blessing her children who gathered at her deathbed. Her mother's death marked the conclusion of her studies and she instead dedicated herself to contemplation in her local parish church. She made a private vow to remain chaste in 1886.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; In 1891 she hatched a scheme to sneak from home to lead a life of penance in the hills but soon decided against this and instead returned home. Since 1904 she desired to be called "Mariam" under the belief she had a vision from the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] in which she was instructed to add it to her name.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; From 1902 to 1905 she was subjected to several exorcisms from [[Venerable]] [[Joseph Vithayathil]] - under the orders of the local bishop - and from 1902 it was Vithayathil who became her [[Spiritual direction|spiritual director]] until her death.

In 1903 she requested Mar [[John Menachery]] - the [[Archbishop of Thrissur]] - to build a house of retreat but it was turned down. This happened after she had formed a group with three other friends and engaged in apostolic work with poor families.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; Menachery instead suggested she make an effort to join a religious congregation and encouraged her to join the new Congregation of the Franciscan Clarists but left since she didn't fell called to it. Mankidiyan later accepted the mar's request in 1912 to join the [[Carmelites]] at [[Ollur]] and was there since November 26, 1912 until she left on 27 January 1913 because she did not feel drawn to them either. In 1913 she set up a house at [[Puthenchira]] and on 14 May 1914 founded the Congregation of the Holy Family to which she was professed in and vested in its habit; she was the first superior of the order. She was said to have had a range of spiritual experiences such as receiving the [[stigmata]] and hid this from public view; she first had this in 1905 though became more visible on 27 January 1909.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; She also purportedly suffered a series of demonic attacks.

In 1926 a falling object struck her on the leg and the wound soon festered. Mankidiyan was admitted to the local hospital though doctors deemed her condition fatal and she was moved by bullock cart back to her [[convent]] where on 7 June 1926 she received the final sacraments and the [[Viaticum]].&lt;ref name=MT/&gt;

She died at 10:00pm on 8 June 1926 from her leg wound that her [[diabetes]] exacerbated.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; Her final words were: "[[Jesus Christ|Jesus]], Mary and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]; I give you my heart and my soul" - she then closed her eyes and died.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; On the morning of her death she was laid on the floor on a mat at her request with her spiritual director and fellow religious huddled around her. Her funeral was celebrated on 9 June and in accordance with her wishes her remains were not washed prior to her funeral.

==Beatification==
The beatification process opened in [[Irinjalakuda]] on 12 July 1982 after the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints|C.C.S (Congregation for the Causes of Saints)]] titled her as a [[Servant of God]] and issued the official "[[nihil obstat]]" (nothing against) to the cause while the cognitional process opened on 14 May 1983 and concluded its business on 24 September 1983; the C.C.S. later validated the process after its conclusion in [[Rome]] on 8 November 1985 and received the [[Positio]] dossier from the postulation a decade later in 1997.

The board of historians met to assess the cause and to determine if historical obstacles existed before issuing their approval for the cause on 27 May 1997 at which point the theologians approved it on 9 October 1998 as did the C.C.S. on 19 April 1999. [[Pope John Paul II]] named the late religious as [[Venerable]] on 28 June 1999 after he confirmed that she had lived a life of [[heroic virtue]]. The investigation of the miracle required for beatification was held in the [[Trichur]] eparchy from 28 April 1992 to 26 July 1993 and was validated on 22 January 1999 before receiving the approval of the medical board on 16 November 1999. Theologians then voiced their own approval on 5 January 2000 . The miracle was that of the cure of one Mathew D. Pellissery, who was born in 1956 with congenital club feet. He could barely walk with great difficulty on the sides of his feet until he was fourteen. After 33 days of fasting and prayer by the whole family, invoking the help of Mariam Thresia, his right foot was straightened during sleep on the night of 21 August 1970. Similarly after 39 days of fasting and prayer his left foot was also straightened overnight during sleep on 28 August 1971. Since then, Mathew has been able to walk normally. This double healing was declared inexplicable in terms of medical science by as many as nine doctors in India and Italy and thus met the last canonical requirement for her beatification. It was declared a miracle obtained through the intercession of Mariam Thresia by the C.C.S. on 18 January 2000 before the Pope himself issued final approval on it on 27 January 2000. John Paul II beatified Mariam Thresia on 9 April 2000 in [[Saint Peter's Square]]. Mathew Pellissery was present there during the beatification ceremony at St. Peter's Square.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt;

The second miracle - and the one needed for her canonization - was investigated in the diocese of its origin and later received the formal validation of the C.C.S. in Rome on 24 June 2014. The miraculous healing of the child Christopher received approval from the medical board in Rome in March 2018 and theologians later confirmed it in October 2018.

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is the [[Jesuit]] priest George Nedungatt.

'''Martha Mason''' (May 31, 1937 &amp;ndash; May 4, 2009)&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite news|title=Martha Mason, Who Wrote Book About Her Decades in an Iron Lung, Dies at 71|first=Margalit|last=Fox|date=May 9, 2009|accessdate=May 10, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/us/10mason.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a writer born and based in [[Lattimore, North Carolina]] who spent 61 years in an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]].

==Early life==
Afflicted with [[polio]] at age eleven during the epidemic of 1948, Mason was sent home from the hospital in an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], in which she remained for the rest of her life. She preferred the iron lung to newer ventilators as it did not require [[intubation]], surgery, or hospitalization. Her brother, Gaston Mason, died of polio and it was only a few days after his funeral that her own polio symptoms began.

She completed high school with daily visits from her teachers, and graduated first in her class with highest honors.

Mason moved to [[Boiling Springs, NC|Boiling Springs]] with her parents to enroll in [[Gardner-Webb University|Gardner-Webb College]] (now University), earning an associate degree at age 21. She then attended (again with her parents' accompaniment) [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest College]] (also now University), earning a bachelor's degree in English in 1960. She was first in her classes at both colleges. She received an honorary doctorate from Gardner-Webb University in May 2004.

After her education, Mason returned to Lattimore and started work at a local newspaper; her mother took dictation of her work. Shortly after, her father was incapacitated by a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and her mother was unable to assist her in her work.

==Later life==
Mason returned to writing in the mid 1990s when advancements in [[speech recognition]] technology enabled her to operate a computer on her own, giving her the ability to dictate and edit, as well as to browse the [[Internet]].

This latter factor was particularly significant for Mason. While her highly social and independent lifestyle (she hosted dinner parties and managed her own household, for example) would probably have only been possible in a tight-knit community (Lattimore's current population is approximately 400), her broad interests were not in tune with small-town perspectives.

She wrote a memoir, ''Breath: Life in the Rhythm of an Iron Lung'', which was published in 2003. She was also the subject of ''Martha in Lattimore'' (2005), a [[documentary film]] by Mary Dalton. Mason also appeared in the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated documentary about polio ''[[The Final Inch]]'' (2009).

==Death==
She died in Lattimore shortly after dawn on Monday, May 4, 2009, one month shy of her 72nd birthday. She had lived 61 years in an iron lung before her death, longer than any other polio survivor in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shelbystar/obituary.aspx?n=martha-mason&amp;pid=126950930&amp;fhid=7697|title=Martha Mason's Obituary on Shelby Star|website=Shelby Star|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Towne Eastey''' (also spelled '''Esty''', '''Easty''', '''Estey''', '''Eastick''', '''Eastie''', or '''Estye)''' ([[baptism|bap.]] August 24, 1634&amp;nbsp;– September 22, 1692) was a defendant in the [[Salem witch trials]] in [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|colonial Massachusetts]]. She was [[executed]] by [[hanging]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] in 1692.

==Early life==
Mary Eastey was born Mary Towne to William Towne and Joanna Towne ([[née]] Blessing) in [[Great Yarmouth]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]]. She was one of eight children, among them her sisters and fellow Salem defendants [[Rebecca Nurse]] and [[Sarah Cloyce]]. Mary Towne and her family moved to [[United States|America]] around 1640. She married Isaac Estey, a farmer and barrel-maker, in 1655 in [[Topsfield, Massachusetts|Topsfield, Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Isaac was born in England on November 27, 1627; the couple had eleven children: Joseph (1657–1739), Sarah (1660–1749), John, Isaac (1662–1714), Hannah, Benjamin, Samuel, Jacob, Joshua, Jeffrey, and Mary.

Like her sister Rebecca Nurse, Eastey was a pious and respected citizen  of Salem, and her accusation came as a surprise. During the examination on April 22, 1692, when Eastey clasped her hands together, [[Mercy Lewis]], one of the afflicted, imitated the gesture and claimed to be unable to release her hands until Eastey released her own. Again, when Eastey inclined her head, the afflicted girls accused her of trying to break their necks. Mercy claimed that Eastey's specter had climbed into her bed and laid her hand upon her breasts.  In the face of  such public hysteria,  Mary  Eastey defended herself with remarkable eloquence: when she was  asked by the  magistrates [[John Hathorne]] and [[Jonathan Corwin]] how far she had complied with Satan, she replied, "Sir, I never complyed with Satan  but prayed against him all my dayes, I have no complyance with Satan, in this ... I will say it,  if it is my last time,  I am clear of this sin." Hathorne, showing a momentary doubt about  her guilt, went so far as to ask the girls if they were quite sure that  Mary Eastey was the woman who afflicted them.&lt;ref name="examinationbare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="examination"/&gt;

For reasons unknown, Eastey was released from prison on May 18 after two months. However, on May 20, Mercy Lewis claimed that Eastey's specter was afflicting her, a claim which other girls supported. A second warrant was issued that night for Eastey's arrest. She was taken from her bed and returned to the prison; Lewis ceased her fits after Eastey was chained. Eastey was tried and condemned to death on September 9.

[[Robert Calef]], in ''[[More Wonders of the Invisible World]]'', described Eastey's parting words to her family "as serious, religious, distinct, and affectionate as could be expressed, drawing tears from the eyes of almost all present." She was hanged on September 22, along with [[Martha Corey]], [[Ann Pudeator]], [[Alice Parker (Salem)|Alice Parker]], [[Mary Parker (Salem witch trials)|Mary Parker]], [[Wilmot Redd]], Margaret Scott, and Samuel Wardwell: [[Cotton Mather]],  to his later embarrassment, denounced them as "eight firebrands of Hell".  On the [[gallows]] she prayed for an end to the witch hunt. Of her two sisters, likewise charged with witchcraft, [[Rebecca Nurse]] was hanged on July 19, 1692, but [[Sarah Cloyce]]  was released in January 1693.

Calef also published Mary Eastey's  last petition to the Court, of which it has been said that no more moving document has ever been addressed to any judge. Mary pleaded not for her own life but for those of the others falsely accused: "I petition your honours not for my own life for I know I must die and my appointed time is set but the Lord he knows it is that no more innocent blood be shed.....the Lord above that is the searcher of all hearts knows that  as I shall answer at the Tribunal seat I never knew the least thing of witchcraft".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Frances ''Delusion of Satan- the Full Story of the Salem Witch Trials''  Hamish Hamilton London 1996  p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, after Eastey had been put to death, Mary Herrick gave testimony about Eastey. Herrick testified that she was visited by Eastey's ghost,  who told her she had been put to death wrongfully and was innocent of witchcraft, and that she had come to vindicate her cause. Eastey's family was compensated with 20 pounds from the government in 1711 for her wrongful execution. Her husband Isaac lived until June 11, 1712.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Mary Eastey's grandson Daniel Eastey fled the country and changed his name during his grandmother's trial, and then moved to [[Miramichi, New Brunswick]], [[Canada]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}

'''Roy G. Gardner''' (January 5, 1884 - January 10, 1940) was an American criminal active during the 1920s. He stole a total of more than $350,000 in cash and securities and several times escaped from custody. He is said to have been the most hunted man in Pacific Coast history, having had a $5,000 reward for his head three times in less than a year, and newspapers in the West referred to him as the "Smiling Bandit", the "Mail Train Bandit", and the "King of the Escape Artists".

==Early life==

Roy Gardner was born on January 5, 1884, in [[Trenton, Missouri]], and was raised in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. He was said to be attractive and charming, standing just under six feet tall, with short, curly auburn hair and blue eyes. He spent his early manhood as a drifter in the Southwest, learning the trades of [[farrier]] and miner. Supposedly he joined the U.S. Army but deserted in 1906 and drifted to Mexico. He was married and had a daughter.

Gardner began his criminal profession as a gunrunner around the time of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. He smuggled and traded arms and ammunition to the [[Venustiano Carranza]] forces until he was captured by soldiers from [[Victoriano Huerta]]'s army and was sentenced to death by firing squad; however, on March 29, 1909, he broke out of the [[Mexico City]] jail along with three other American prisoners after attacking the soldier guards. Back in the United States, Gardner became a [[prizefighter]] in the Southwest. He was good enough that he became a sparring partner for Heavyweight Champion [[James J. Jeffries|J. J. Jeffries]] at Ben Lemond Training Camp in [[Reno, Nevada]], during the summer of 1910.

Eventually, Gardner ended up in San Francisco, where he gambled all of his boxing money away and then robbed a jewelry store on [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]]. He was arrested and spent some time in [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]], but was paroled after he saved a prison guard's life during a riot. He then landed a job as an acetylene welder at the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]], married, fathered a daughter, and on [[Armistice Day]] in 1918 left and began his own welding company.

==Robbery career==

On a business trip to Mexico, Gardner gambled all his money away at the racetracks in Tijuana. Then on the night of April 16, 1920, outside San Diego, he robbed a U. S. Mail truck of about $80,000 in cash and securities. The job went smoothly, but he was arrested three days later while burying his loot. He was sentenced to 25 years at [[McNeil Island Corrections Center|McNeil Island Federal Penitentiary]] for the armed robbery, but vowed he would never serve the sentence. On June 5, 1920, he was being transported by train, accompanied by Deputy U. S. Marshals Cavanaugh and Haig. Some way outside [[Portland, Oregon]], he peered out of the train window and yelled, "Look at that deer!". The lawmen looked, and Gardner grabbed Haig's gun from his holster, then disarmed Cavanaugh at gunpoint, handcuffed the two together, and stole $200. He jumped off the train and made his way to Canada.

He slipped back into the United States the next year, and started robbing banks and mail trains across the country as a lone bandit. Returning to California, on May 19, 1921, he tied up the mail clerk on Train No. 10 eastbound from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and robbed the express car of $187,000. The next morning, he told the mail clerk of Train No. 20 to throw up his hands or he would blow his head off. When the train reached the Overland Limited at [[Roseville, California|Roseville]], he ran down the tracks with an armful of mail. The home office recognized the gunman as Roy Gardner, the train robber with a $5,000 reward on his head.

Gardner was recognized at the Porter House Hotel and while he was playing a game of cards in a pool hall, federal agents arrived and captured him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=970&amp;dat=19210602&amp;id=6-MmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ChQGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=522,1118572 |title=Mail Bandit Is Captured |newspaper=The Blair Press |location=[[Blair, Wisconsin]] |date=June 2, 1921 |page=2 }}&lt;!-- The adjacent column contains a story on his being sought for robbing Train #20. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to another 25 years at McNeil Island for armed robbery of the mail trains.

Trying to reduce his sentence, he told [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] detectives that he would lead them to the spot where he buried his loot. The officers found nothing, and Gardner announced, "I guess I have forgotten where I buried that money." He was heavily shackled, with the addition of an "Oregon Boot", and was once again transported on a train to McNeil Island, this time by U. S. Marshals Mulhall and Rinkell, both fast-shooting veterans. During the journey, Gardner asked to use the bathroom, in which an associate had earlier hidden a .32&amp;nbsp;caliber pistol. When he came out of the bathroom, Gardner pointed the gun at Mulhall and ordered another prisoner to handcuff the two lawmen to the seat. He relieved the officers of their weapons and cash before hopping onto another moving train outside [[Castle Rock, Washington]].

The largest manhunt in Pacific Coast history began after this. Gardner was described as a dangerous man who would shoot on sight and must be captured at all costs. He once again had a $5,000 reward on his head.

He arrived in [[Centralia, Washington]], where he was almost recognized by Jack Scuitto at the Olympic Club. Gardner plastered his face with bandages to hide his identity, leaving one eye slit, and told the Oxford Hotel staff that he had been severely burned in an industrial accident near [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]. Proprietor Gertrude Howell and Officer [[Louis Sonney]]&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0814430|Louis Sonney}}&lt;/ref&gt; became suspicious of the bandaged man, and when Sonney saw a firearm in Gardner's hotel room, he accused him of being the "Smiling Bandit". Gardner fought back, but was arrested and a doctor removed the bandages, confirming his identity. He was sentenced to another 25 years, and heavily chained, was finally brought to McNeil Island.

===Escape from McNeil Island===

After six weeks at the penitentiary, Gardner had convinced two other prisoners, Lawardus Bogart and Everett Impyn, that he had "paid off" the guards in the towers. On [[Labor Day]], September 5, 1921, at a prison baseball game, he said "Now!" during the fifth inning when someone hit a fly ball into center field, as the guards in the towers had their eyes on the ball and the runners. He, Bogart, and Impyn ran 300&amp;nbsp;yards to the high barbed-wire fence where Gardner cut a hole, and the three men ran to the pasture as bullets whirled about their heads. Gardner was wounded in his left leg, but escaped behind a herd of cattle near timber.&lt;!--following ref is for part of this paragaph--&gt;&lt;ref name = "McCabe"&gt;Scott McCabe, "'Smiling Bandit' makes daring escape off island", Crime History, ''The Washington Examiner'', September 5, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw Bogart fall, badly wounded. Impyn was shot dead; his dying words were, "Gardner told us those fellows in the towers couldn't hit the broad side of a barn." Bogart later said that Gardner had deceived them and used his companions as decoys to better his chances of escape.

Guards scoured the beaches and confiscated every boat on the shoreline, but were unable to find Gardner, who lived in the prison barn, drinking milk from the cows, and then swam to [[Fox Island, Washington|Fox Island]], where he lived off fruit in the orchards. Warden Maloney claimed Gardner was still on McNeil Island, but by that time Gardner had already left. A San Francisco newspaper published a letter from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19210926&amp;id=wzlXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5e8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6168,6218638 |title=Newspaper Claims Letter From Roy Gardner |newspaper=[[Eugene Daily Guard]] |location=Eugene, Oregon |date=September 26, 1921 |pages=1, 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recapture and Alcatraz===

[[File:Alcatraz Island.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Alcatraz Island in 2005]]
Gardner was now the "Most Wanted" criminal, and committed several crimes in [[Arizona]] before he was captured by a mail clerk during a train robbery in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in fall  1921. He was sentenced to an additional 25 years, this time at [[Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19211214&amp;id=8TZUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PzoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3684,6785930 |title=To Operate On Skull Of Roy Gardner |newspaper=[[Gettysburg Times]] |location=Gettysburg, Pennsylvania |date=December 14, 1921 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Headlines read: "Gangster Gardner brags, 'Leavenworth will never hold me'".

Now known as the "King of the Escape Artists", Gardner was transferred in 1925 to [[Atlanta Federal Prison]], then the toughest prison in the country. The following year, he tried to tunnel under the wall and saw through the bars in the shoe shop. Then in 1927, he led a prison break during which he held the captain and two guards hostage with two revolvers, but the escape failed and he was placed in solitary confinement for twenty months. When he was released from solitary confinement, he was placed in a mental hospital in Washington, D. C.

In 1929, the warden described Gardner as the "most dangerous inmate in the history of Atlanta Prison",&lt;ref name = "McCabe" /&gt; and that year he began a hunger strike protesting prison food and threatened suicide. He was then transferred to Leavenworth Annex Prison in 1930, and in 1934 he was transferred to [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]], where he was one of the first hardened criminals incarcerated there.&lt;ref name = "McCabe" /&gt;

Gardner's time in Alcatraz coincided with [[Al Capone]]'s. Capone was an unpopular prisoner. Supposedly, an unidentified inmate once threw a lead [[sash weight|sash]] at Capone, but Capone was only wounded in the arm because Gardner pushed him out of the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.co.uk/shows/alcatraz-search-for-the-truth/articles/famous-alcatraz-inmates |title=''Alcatraz: Search for the Truth'': Famous Alcatraz Inmates |publisher=[[History (European TV channel)|History]] |year=2015 |accessdate=October 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Gardner's time in Alcatraz, his wife divorced him. He worked and supervised at the mat shop with Ralph Roe and they planned an escape, but Gardner was paroled and released in 1938 after his appeal for clemency was approved.

==Final years==
In 1939 Gardner published his autobiography, titled ''Hellcatraz''.&lt;ref name = "McCabe" /&gt; He attended crime lectures, and he and Louis Sonney made one of the first re-enactments, a short film called ''You Can't Beat the Rap''. Gardner worked as a film salesman and an exposition barker. A 1939 movie called ''[[I Stole a Million]]'' was based on his life; it was a failure.

On the evening of January 10, 1940, in a hotel room in San Francisco, Gardner wrote four notes; one of them he attached to the door, warning: "Do not open door. Poison gas. Call police."&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward |first1=David A. |authorlink1= |last2=Kassabaum |first2=Gene G. |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Alcatraz: The Gangster Years |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2009 |month= |origyear= |publisher=University of California Press |location= |language= |isbn=9780520256071 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=187–88 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Alcatraz on Trial |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kV6KXrkQjTsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA187#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sealed the door from the inside, then killed himself by dropping [[cyanide]] into a glass of acid and inhaling the poison fumes.&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt;

'''Taavi Peetre''' (5 July 1983 – 11 September 2010)&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;[http://sport.postimees.ee/?id=311790 Taavi Peetre's obituary] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Estonia]]n [[shot put]]ter and [[discus throw]]er. He represented his country at two [[Olympic Games]] (in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]] and [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]) and also took part in the [[World Championships in Athletics]] on two occasions. His personal best shot put mark of 20.33&amp;nbsp;m is the second best by an Estonian thrower after [[Heino Sild]]. His personal best in discus throw was 60.84&amp;nbsp;m, achieved in April 2010 in [[Denton, Texas]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.team75plus.com/20109 Aleksander Tammert opened his season with 61.50 in Denton]&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 2010 after a boat accident.

==Career==
Born in [[Käina Parish]], his first major international competition was the [[1999 World Youth Championships in Athletics]], where he was tenth in the discus throw qualifiers of the competition's inaugural edition.&lt;ref name=IAAF&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/biographies/letter=0/athcode=171201/index.html Peetre Taavi]. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Peetre finished ninth in the shot put final at the [[2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics|2002 World Junior Championships]], having already thrown a national junior record of 17.71&amp;nbsp;m earlier that year, and also competed in the qualifiers of the discus contest.&lt;ref name=EA&gt;[http://www.european-athletics.org/general-news/estonian-shot-putter-taavi-peetre-dies-in-an-accident.html Estonian shot putter Taavi Peetre dies in an accident] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016101424/http://www.european-athletics.org/general-news/estonian-shot-putter-taavi-peetre-dies-in-an-accident.html |date=2010-10-16 }}. [[European Athletics]] (2010-09-13). Retrieved on 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; He improved his best shot put mark to 19.02&amp;nbsp;m the following year and made his first Olympic appearance at the [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's shot put|2004 Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=IAAF/&gt;

Having changed his focus to primarily the shot put, the 2005 season marked a further breakthrough into the senior ranks. He represented Estonia at the [[2005 European Athletics Indoor Championships]] and then at the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics – Men's shot put|2005 World Championships]] later in the season, but did not get past the qualifiers on either occasion.&lt;ref name=IAAF/&gt; He enjoyed success at lower level competitions, however, winning shot put [[silver medal]]s at the [[2005 European Athletics U23 Championships]], [[Athletics at the 2005 Summer Universiade|2005 Universiade]], and in the A League of the [[2005 European Cup (athletics)|2005 European Cup]].

He improved his indoor shot put best in February 2006, throwing 19.81&amp;nbsp;m, and was eleventh at the [[European Cup Winter Throwing]]. He retained his runner-up place in the A League section of the [[2006 European Cup (athletics)|2006 European Cup]], but managed only eleventh in the qualifiers of his first continental outdoor championships, the [[2006 European Athletics Championships]]. A low-key 2007 was highlighted by a win at the national championships and eighteenth in the qualifiers at the [[2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships]].&lt;ref name=IAAF/&gt;

He returned to top form in 2008, throwing over sixty metres in the discus for the first time and putting a season's best of 20.22&amp;nbsp;m in the shot just prior to the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]]. At his second [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's shot put|Olympic shot put competition]] he had a best mark of 19.57&amp;nbsp;m but failed to reach the final round. In 2009 he regained the national shot put title and gave his best performance at a global event at the [[2009 World Championships in Athletics]]: his mark of 19.91&amp;nbsp;m was the fifth best of his qualification group, but this was not enough to progress to the final.&lt;ref name=IAAF/&gt; He achieved a personal best in the shot put of 20.33&amp;nbsp;m in July 2010 in [[Viljandi]], Estonia. His last major international championships was the [[2010 European Athletics Championships]], where he threw 19.42&amp;nbsp;m for seventh place in the qualifying round.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt;

On 11 September 2010, Peetre drowned in [[Lake Tamula]] during a fishing trip with friends.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

[[File:Three Stooges 1937.jpg|right|thumb|Larry Fine, Curly Howard and Moe Howard in 1937]]
This is a complete list of [[short subjects]] and [[feature films]] that featured [[The Three Stooges]] released between 1930 and 1970.

*'''[[Moe Howard]]''', '''[[Larry Fine]]''' and '''[[Shemp Howard]]''' appeared in a single feature film with [[Ted Healy]] released by [[Fox Film Corporation]] entitled ''[[Soup to Nuts]]'' (1930). Shemp departed the act in 1932 to pursue a solo career and was replaced by younger brother '''[[Curly Howard]]'''. This incarnation of the team appeared in several shorts and feature films with Healy at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1933 and 1934.
*Moe and Shemp appeared without Larry or Healy in a 1929 [[Movietone News|Fox Movietone Newsreel]].
*Moe appeared without Larry, Curly, or Healy in the 1933 MGM PSA ''Give a Man a Job''.
*Moe and Curly appeared without Healy or Larry in the MGM feature film ''[[Broadway to Hollywood (film)|Broadway to Hollywood]]'' (1933).
*Moe and Curly appeared without Healy or Larry in the MGM short subject ''[[Jail Birds of Paradise]]'' (1934).
*Curly appeared in the MGM short subject ''[[Roast Beef and Movies]]'' (1934) without Healy, Moe, or Larry.
*Larry and Healy appeared without Moe or Curly in the MGM feature ''Stage Mother'' (1933).
*Curly and Healy appeared without Moe or Larry in the MGM feature ''[[Operator 13]]'' (1934).

Moe, Larry and Curly left Healy in 1934 and moved to [[Columbia Pictures]] to begin their successful series of 190 shorts, with their contract extended each year until the final one expired on December 31, 1957. The final 8 of the 16 shorts with '''[[Joe Besser]]''' were released afterwards over the next 1⅓ years. It is for these 190 short films, which have appeared on television in steady rotation since 1958, that the Stooges are best known. These films appear on this list in numbered format. The Stooges would continue afterwards with Moe, Larry, and '''[[Joe DeRita]]''' (as "Curly Joe"), and make several full-length feature films between 1959 and 1970.

Joe Besser never appeared with the Stooges in a feature film.

Three feature-length Columbia releases were actually packages of older Columbia shorts. ''Columbia Laff Hour'' (introduced in 1956) was a random assortment that included the Stooges among other Columbia comedians like [[Andy Clyde]], [[Hugh Herbert]], and [[Vera Vague]]; the content and length varied from one theater to the next. ''Three Stooges Fun-o-Rama'' (introduced in 1959) was an all-Stooges show capitalizing on their TV fame, again with shorts chosen at random for individual theaters. ''The Three Stooges Follies'' (1974) was similar to ''Laff Hour'', with a trio of Stooge comedies augmented by [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Vera Vague]] shorts, a [[Batman]] serial chapter, and a [[Kate Smith]] musical.

The '''Tockwogh''' were an [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribe first discovered by Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]]'s party after being informed about them by the [[Mingo|Massawomekes]] ([[Iroquois]]). The name Tockwogh is a variation of [[Wolfiporia extensa|tuckahoe]], a water plant with bulbous roots used for food. At their first meeting, Smith noticed they wore copper hatchets and beads which were traded with their allies, the [[Susquehannock]], mortal enemies of the Massawomeke. The Indians held a feast for Smith's party. Smith noticed that the Tockwogh [[wigwam]]s were very different from those of other [[Algonquian peoples]]: longer, larger, covered with bark, and shaped like ovals. About 20 made a village and villages were surrounded by fields of corn, squash, beans, tobacco. Before leaving the Tockwoghs, Smith traded blue beads, bells and hatchets for corn, pearls, meat, weapons and hides.

'''Álvaro Obregón Salido''' ({{IPA-es|ˈalβaɾo oβɾeˈɣon}}; February 19, 1880 – July 17, 1928) was a general in the [[Mexican Revolution]], who became [[President of Mexico]] from 1920 to 1924. He supported Sonora's decision to follow Governor of Coahuila [[Venustiano Carranza]] as leader of a revolution against the Huerta regime. Carranza appointed Obregón commander of the revolutionary forces in northwestern Mexico and in 1915 appointed him as his minister of war. In 1920, Obregón launched a revolt against Carranza, in which Carranza was assassinated; he won the subsequent election with overwhelming support.

Obregón's presidency was the first stable presidency since the Revolution began in 1910. He oversaw massive educational reform (with [[Mexican muralism]] flourishing), moderate land reform, and labor laws sponsored by the increasingly powerful [[Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers]]. In August 1923, he signed the [[Bucareli Treaty]] that clarified the rights of the Mexican government and U.S. oil interests and brought U.S. diplomatic recognition to his government.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Howard F. ''The United States and Mexico''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1961, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923–24, Obregón's finance minister, [[Adolfo de la Huerta]], launched a rebellion in part protesting the Bucareli Treaty; Obregón returned to the battlefield to crush the rebellion. In his victory, he was aided by the United States with arms and 17 U.S. planes that bombed de la Huerta's supporters.&lt;ref name="Cline, p. 208"&gt;Cline, ''U.S. and Mexico'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Obregón's fellow Northern revolutionary general and hand-picked successor, [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], was elected president, and although Obregón ostensibly retired to Sonora, he remained influential under Calles. Having pushed through constitutional reform to once again make reelection possible, Obregón won the 1928 election, but was assassinated by [[José de León Toral]], a Mexican offended by the government's anti-religious laws, before he could begin his second term. Toral's subsequent trial ultimately led to his execution by firing squad, and it also involved a Capuchin nun named María Concepción Acevedo de la Llata, "Madre Conchita", who was thought to be the mastermind behind Obregón's murder.&lt;ref&gt;Heilman, Jaymie. "The Demon Inside: Madre Conchita, Gender, and the Assassination of Obregon". ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', 18.1 (2002): 23–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years, 1880–1911==
Obregón was born in Siquisiva, [[Sonora]], Municipality of [[Navojoa]], the son of Francisco Obregón and Cenobia Salido. Francisco Obregón had once owned a substantial estate, but his business partner supported Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] during the [[French intervention in Mexico]] (1861–1867), and the family's estate was therefore confiscated by the Liberal government in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, Enrique (1997). {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|Mexico: Biography of Power, p. 374|page=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco Obregón died in 1880, the year of Álvaro Obregón's birth, leaving Álvaro to be raised in poverty by his mother and his older sisters Cenobia, María, and Rosa.&lt;ref name="krauze375"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 375|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his childhood, he worked on the family farm and became acquainted with the [[Mayo people]] who also worked there. He attended a school run by his brother José in [[Huatabampo]] and thus received an elementary education. He spent his teenage years working a variety of jobs, before finding permanent employment in 1898 as a [[lathe]] operator at the [[sugar mill]] owned by his maternal uncles in [[Navolato, Sinaloa]].&lt;ref name="krauze375"/&gt;

In 1903, he married Refugio Urrea and in 1904, he left the sugar mill to sell shoes [[door-to-door]], and then to become a [[tenant farmer]]. By 1906, he was in a position to buy his own small farm, where he grew [[chickpeas]]. The next year was tragic for Obregón as his wife and two of his children died, leaving him a [[widower]] with two small children, who were henceforth raised by his three older sisters. In 1909, Obregón invented a chickpea [[Combine harvester|harvester]] and soon founded a company to manufacture these harvesters, complete with a modern [[assembly line]]. He successfully marketed these harvesters to chickpea farmers throughout the [[Mayo Valley]].&lt;ref name="krauze375"/&gt;

==Military career, 1911–1915==

===Early military career, 1911–1913===
Obregón entered politics in 1911 with his election as [[municipal president]] of the town of [[Huatabampo]]. Obregón expressed little sympathy for the Anti-reelectionist movement launched by [[Francisco I. Madero]] in 1908–1909 in opposition to [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Porfirio Díaz]]. Thus, when Madero began the [[Mexican Revolution]] in November 1910 by issuing his [[Plan of San Luis Potosí]], Obregón did not join the struggle against Porfirio Díaz.&lt;ref name="krauze377"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 377|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madero succeeded in defeating Porfirio Díaz and thus became President of Mexico in November 1911.&lt;ref name="krauze377"/&gt;
[[Image:Pascual Orozco3.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Pascual Orozco]] (1882–1915), who fought with [[Francisco I. Madero]] (1873–1913) in 1910, only to launch a rebellion against him in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] in 1911. Obregón's first experience in the military was supporting pro-Madero forces under [[Victoriano Huerta]] (1850–1916) against Orozco's rebellion.]]

Obregón became a supporter of Madero shortly after Madero became President of Mexico. In March 1912, [[Pascual Orozco]], a general who had fought with Madero during the Mexican Revolution, but had grown disaffected with Madero, launched a revolt against Madero's regime in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] with the financial backing of [[Luis Terrazas]], a former [[Governor of Chihuahua]] and the largest landowner in Mexico.&lt;ref name="krauze377"/&gt;

In April 1912, Obregón volunteered to join the local Maderista forces, the Fourth [[Irregular military|Irregular]] [[Battalion]] of [[Sonora]], organized under the command of General Sanginés to oppose Orozco's revolt.&lt;ref name="krauze378"&gt;Krauze, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

This Battalion supported federal troops under the command of [[Victoriano Huerta]] sent by Madero to crush Orozco's rebellion. Within weeks of joining the Battalion, Obregón displayed signs of military genius. Obregón disobeyed his superior's orders but won several battles by luring his enemy into traps, surprise assaults, and encircling maneuvers.&lt;ref name="krauze378"/&gt;

Obregón was quickly promoted through the ranks and attained the rank of [[Colonel]] before resigning in December 1912, following victory over Orozco (with Orozco fleeing to the United States).&lt;ref name="krauze379"&gt;Krauze, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

Obregón had intended to return to civilian life in December 1912, but then in February 1913, the Madero regime was overthrown in a ''[[coup d'état]]'' (known to Mexican history as ''[[La decena trágica]]'') orchestrated by [[Victoriano Huerta]], [[Félix Díaz (politician)|Félix Díaz]], [[Bernardo Reyes]], and [[Henry Lane Wilson]], the [[United States Ambassador to Mexico]]. Huerta assumed the presidency.&lt;ref name="krauze379"/&gt;

Obregón immediately traveled to [[Hermosillo]] to offer his services to the government of [[Sonora]] in opposition to the Huerta regime. The Sonoran government refused to recognize the Huerta regime, and in early March 1913, Obregón was appointed chief of Sonora's War Department. In this capacity, he set out on campaign, and in a matter of days had managed to drive federal troops out of [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]], [[Cananea]], and [[Naco, Sonora|Naco]]. He soon followed up by capturing the port city of [[Guaymas]]. He squared off against federal troops in May 1913 at the battle of Santa Rosa through an encirclement of enemy forces. As commander of Sonora's forces, Obregón won the respect of many revolutionaries who had fought under Madero in 1910–11, most notably [[Benjamín G. Hill]].&lt;ref name="krauze379"/&gt;

===Struggle against the Huerta Regime, 1913–1914===
The Sonoran government was in contact with the government of [[Coahuila]], which had also refused to recognize the Huerta regime and entered a state of rebellion. A Sonoran delegation headed by [[Adolfo de la Huerta]] traveled to [[Monclova]] to meet with the [[Governor of Coahuila]], [[Venustiano Carranza]]. The Sonoran government signed on to Carranza's [[Plan of Guadalupe]], by which Carranza became "''primer jefe''" of the newly proclaimed [[Constitutional Army]]. On 30 September 1913, Carranza appointed Obregón [[commander-in-chief]] of the Constitutional Army in the Northwest, with jurisdiction over [[Sonora]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Durango]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], and [[Baja California]].&lt;ref name="krauze379"/&gt;

[[Image:Obregon and yaqui staff.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Gen. Obregón and staff of [[Yaqui]]s, {{circa|1913}}]]
In November 1913, Obregón's forces captured [[Culiacán]], thus securing the supremacy of the Constitutional Army in the entire area of Northwestern Mexico under Obregón's command.&lt;ref name="krauze379"/&gt;
[[File:Venustiano_Carranza_y_Álvaro_Obregón.jpg|thumb|right|Álvaro Obregón (center left) and grey-bearded "First Chief" of the Constitutionalists, [[Venustiano Carranza]].]]
Obregón and other Sonorans were deeply suspicious of Carranza's Secretary of War, [[Felipe Ángeles]], because they considered Ángeles to be a holdover of the old Díaz regime. At the urging of the Sonorans (the most powerful group in Carranza's coalition following Obregón's victories in the Northwest), Carranza downgraded Ángeles to the position of Sub-Secretary of War.&lt;ref&gt;Slattery, Matthew (1982). ''Felipe Ángeles and the Mexican Revolution'', pp. 59–60; Katz, Friedrich (1998). {{Google books|XAIcq6AJ3OwC|The Life and Times of Pancho Villa, p. 277|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of his demotion, Ángeles formulated the rebel grand strategy of a three-prong attack south to [[Mexico City]]: (1) Obregón would advance south along the western railroad, (2) [[Pancho Villa]] would advance south along the central railroad, and (3) [[Pablo González Garza]] would advance south along the eastern railroad.&lt;ref&gt;Slattery, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Obregón began his march south in April 1914. Whereas Pancho Villa preferred wild [[cavalry]] charges, Obregón was again more cautious. Villa was soon at odds with Carranza, and in May 1914, Carranza instructed Obregón to increase the pace of his southern campaign to ensure that he beat Villa's troops to Mexico City. Obregón moved his troops from [[Topolobampo, Sinaloa]], to [[blockade]] [[Mazatlán]], and then to [[Tepic]], where Obregón cut off the railroad from [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]], to [[Colima]], thus leaving both of these ports isolated.&lt;ref name="krauze380"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 380|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early July, Obregón moved south to Orendaín, Jalisco, where his troops defeated federal troops, leaving 8000 dead, and making it clear that the Huerta regime was defeated. Obregón was promoted to [[major general]]. He continued his march south. Upon Obregón's arrival in [[Teoloyucan, Mexico State]], it was clear that Huerta was defeated, and, on 11 August, on the [[mudguard]] of a car, Obregón signed the treaties that ended the Huerta regime. On 16 August 1914, Obregón and 18,000 of his troops marched triumphantly into [[Mexico City]]. He was joined shortly by Carranza, who marched triumphantly into Mexico City on 20 August.&lt;ref name="krauze380"/&gt;

In Mexico City, Obregón moved to exact revenge on his perceived enemies. He believed that the [[Mexican Catholic Church]] had supported the Huerta regime, and he therefore imposed a fine of 500,000 [[peso]]s on the church, to be paid to the Revolutionary Council for Aid to the People.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 382|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also believed that the rich had been pro-Huerta, and he therefore imposed special taxes on [[Capital (economics)|capital]], real estate, [[mortgages]], water, [[Road surface|pavement]], [[sanitary sewer|sewers]], [[carriages]], automobiles, bicycles, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|pp. 382–383|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special measure were also taken against foreigners. Some of these were deliberately humiliating: for example, he forced foreign businessmen to sweep the streets of Mexico City.&lt;ref name="krauze383"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 383|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Break with Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, 1914===
Tensions between Carranza and Pancho Villa grew throughout 1914, as Villa created a number of diplomatic incidents that Carranza was worried would invite outside intervention in the Mexican Revolution. On 8 July 1914, Villistas and Carrancistas had signed the Treaty of [[Torreón]], in which they agreed that after Huerta's forces were defeated, 150 generals of the Revolution would meet to determine the future shape of the country. However, Carranza disliked Villa's insubordination so much that he refused to let Villa march into Mexico City in August. In September, Villa and Carranza formally split, and during this time Obregón paid a visit to Villa that nearly resulted in Villa's having Obregón shot.&lt;ref name="krauze383"/&gt;

[[Image:Pancho Villa, el presidente provisional Eulalio Gutiérrez y Emiliano Zapata1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Eulalio Gutiérrez]] (1881–1939), flanked by [[Pancho Villa|Francisco "Pancho" Villa]] (1878–1923) and [[Emiliano Zapata]] (1879–1919). Gutiérrez was appointed provisional President of Mexico by the [[Convention of Aguascalientes]], a move that [[Venustiano Carranza]] (1859–1920) found intolerable. In the ensuing war, Obregón fought for Carranza against the Convention.]]
The Convention that the Carrancistas and Villistas had agreed to in the Treaty of Torreón went ahead at [[Aguascalientes City|Aguascalientes]] on 5 October 1914. Carranza did not participate in the [[Convention of Aguascalientes]] because he was not a general, but, as a general, Obregón participated. The Convention soon split into two major factions: (1) the Carrancistas, who insisted that the Convention should follow the promise of the Plan of Guadalupe and restore the [[1857 Constitution of Mexico]]; and (2) the Villistas, who sought more wide-ranging social reforms than set out in the Plan of Guadalupe. The Villistas were supported by [[Emiliano Zapata]], leader of the [[Liberation Army of the South]], who had issued his own [[Plan of Ayala]], which called for wide-ranging social reforms. For a month and a half, Obregón maintained neutrality between the two sides, and tried to reach a middle ground that would avoid a civil war.&lt;ref name="krauze384"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 384|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, it became clear that the Villistas/Zapatistas had prevailed at the Convention; Carranza, however, refused to accept the Convention's preparations for a "preconstitutional" regime, which Carranza believed was totally inadequate, and in late November, Carranza rejected the authority of the regime imposed by the Convention. Forced to choose sides, Obregón naturally sided with Carranza and left the Convention to fight for the ''Primer Jefe''. He had made many friends amongst the Villistas and Zapatistas at the Convention, and was able to convince some of them to depart with him. On December 12, 1914, Carranza issued his Additions to the Plan of Guadalupe, which laid out an ambitious reform program, including Laws of Reform, in conscious imitation of [[Benito Juárez]]'s Laws of Reform.&lt;ref name="krauze384"/&gt;

===Battle with the Conventionists, 1915===
[[Image:Alvaro Obregon.jpg|thumb|left|200px|General Obregón.]]
Once again, Obregón was able to recruit loyal troops by promising them land in return for military service. In this case, in February 1915, the Constitutionalist Army signed an agreement with the ''[[:es:Casa del Obrero Mundial|Casa del Obrero Mundial]]'' ("House of the World Worker"), the labor union with [[anarcho-syndicalist]] connections which had been established during [[Francisco I. Madero]]'s presidency. As a result of this agreement, six "Red Battalions" of workers were formed to fight alongside the Constitutionalists against the [[Conventionists (Mexico)|Conventionists Villa and Zapata]]. This agreement had the side effect of lending the Carrancistas legitimacy with the urban [[proletariat]].&lt;ref name="krauze384"/&gt;
[[File:Venustiano Carranza en La Cañada, Queretaro.JPG|260px|thumb|left| General Álvaro Obregón (left) shown with a cigar in his left hand and his right arm missing, lost in the [[Battle of Celaya]] in 1915. Center is First Chief [[Venustiano Carranza]]]]
Obregón's forces easily defeated Zapatista forces at [[Puebla]] in early 1915. However, the Villistas remained in control of large portions of the country. Forces under Pancho Villa were moving towards the [[Bajío]]; [[Felipe Ángeles]]' forces occupied [[Saltillo]] and thus dominated the northeast; the forces of Calixto Contreras and [[Rodolfo Fierro]] controlled western Mexico; and forces under [[Tomás Urbina]] were active in [[Tamaulipas]] and [[San Luis Potosí]].&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|pp. 384–385|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The armies of Obregón and Villa clashed in four battles, collectively known as the [[Battle of Celaya]], the largest military confrontation in [[Latin American]] history before the [[Falklands War]] of 1982. The first battle took place on 6 April and 7 April 1915 and ended with the withdrawal of the Villistas. The second, in [[Celaya]], [[Guanajuato]], took place between 13 April and 15 April, when Villa attacked the city of Celaya, but was repulsed. The third was the prolonged position battle of Trinidad and Santa Ana del Conde between 29 April and 5 June, which was the definitive battle. Villa was again defeated by Obregón, who lost his right arm in the fight.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, pp. 386–387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Villa made a last attempt to stop Obregón's army in Aguascalientes on 10 July, but without success. Obregón distinguished himself during the Battle of Celaya by being one of the first Mexicans to comprehend that the introduction of modern [[field artillery]], and especially [[machine guns]], had shifted the battlefield in favor of a defending force. In fact, while Obregón studied this shift and used it in his defense of Celaya, generals in the World War I trenches of Europe were still advocating bloody and mostly failing mass charges.&lt;ref name="krauze387"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 387|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obregón's arm===
[[File:Alvaro Obregón.jpg|thumb|left|200px|President Obregón in a business suit, showing that he lost his right arm fighting [[Pancho Villa]] in 1915. It earned him the nickname of ''El Manco de Celaya'' ("the one-armed man of Celaya").]]
[[File:MonumentAlvaroObrgonDF.JPG|thumb|right|Monument to Álvaro Obregón in which his lost arm was placed.]]
During the battles with Villa, Obregón had his right arm blown off. The blast nearly killed him, and he attempted to put himself out of his misery and fired his pistol to accomplish that.  The aide de camp who had cleaned his gun had neglected to put bullets in the weapon. In a wry story he told about himself, he joined in the search for his missing arm. "I was helping them myself, because it's not so easy to abandon such a necessary thing as an arm."  The searchers had no luck. A comrade reached into his pocket and raised a gold coin. Obregón concluded the story, saying "And then everyone saw a miracle: the arm came forth from who knows where, and come skipping up to where the gold ''azteca'' [coin] was elevated; it reached up and grasped it in its fingers--lovingly--That was the only way to get my lost arm to appear."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Dulles, John W.F. ''Yesterday in Mexico: A Chronicle of Revolution, 1919-1936''. Austin: University of Texas 1961, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchenau, Jürgen. "The Arm and Body of the Revolution: Remembering Mexico's Last Caudillo, Álvaro Obregón" in Lyman L. Johnson, ed. ''Body Politics: Death, Dismemberment, and Memory in Latin America''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2004, pp. 179–207.&lt;/ref&gt; The arm was subsequently embalmed and then put in the monument to Obregón on the site of where he was assassinated in 1928. Obregón always wore clothing tailored to show that he had lost his arm in battle, a visible sign of his sacrifice to Mexico.

== Early political career, 1915–1920 ==

===Minister of War in Carranza's Preconstitutional Regime, 1915–1916===
In May 1915, Carranza had proclaimed himself the head of what he termed a "Preconstitutional Regime" that would govern Mexico until a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] could be held. Carranza appointed Obregón as [[Minister of War]] in his new cabinet.&lt;ref name="krauze387"/&gt;

As Minister of War, Obregón determined to modernize and [[professionalize]] the [[Mexican military]] thoroughly. In the process, he founded a [[staff college]] and a school of [[military medicine]]. He also founded the Department of Aviation and a school to train pilots. [[Munitions]] factories were placed under the direct control of the military.&lt;ref name="krauze387"/&gt;

===Break with Carranza, 1917–1920===
In September 1916, Carranza convoked a Constitutional Convention, to be held in [[Querétaro, Querétaro]]. He declared that the liberal [[1857 Constitution of Mexico]] would be respected, though purged of some of its shortcomings.

However, when the Constitutional Convention met in December 1916, it contained only 85 conservatives and centrists close to Carranza's brand of liberalism, a group known as the ''bloque renovador'' ("renewal faction"). Against them were 132 more radical delegates who insisted that [[Land reform in Mexico|land reform]] be embodied in the new constitution.

Obregón now broke with Carranza and threw his considerable weight behind the radicals. He met with radical legislators, as well as the intellectual leader of the radicals, [[Andrés Molina Enríquez]], and came out in favor of all their key issues. In particular, unlike Carranza, Obregón supported the land reform mandated by [[Mexican constitution#Article 27|Article 27]] of the constitution. He also supported the heavily [[anticlerical]] Articles [[Mexican constitution#Article 3|3]] and [[Mexican constitution#Article 130|130]] that Carranza opposed.&lt;ref name="krauze387"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Shortly after swearing his allegiance to the new Constitution, Obregón resigned as Minister of War and retired to Huatabampo to resume his life as a chickpea farmer. He organized the region's chickpea farmers in a producer's league and briefly entertained the idea of going to France to fight on the side of the Allies in World War I. He made a considerable amount of money in these years, and also entertained many visitors. As the victorious general of the Mexican Revolution, Obregón remained enormously popular throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Buchenau, pp. 94–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1919, Obregón had determined to use his immense popularity to run in the presidential election that would be held in 1920. Carranza announced that he would not run for president in 1920, but refused to endorse Obregón, instead endorsing an obscure diplomat, [[Ignacio Bonillas]]. Obregón announced his candidacy in June 1919. In August, he concluded an agreement with [[Luis Napoleón Morones]] and the [[Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers]], promising that if elected, he would create a Department of Labor, install a labor-friendly Minister of Industry and Commerce, and issue a new labor law.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|pp. 375–389|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obregón began to campaign in earnest in November 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 389|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Carranza seemed determined to stop Obregón. At Carranza's behest, the Senate stripped Obregón of his military rank, a move which only increased Obregón's popularity. Then, Carranza orchestrated a plot in which a minor officer claimed that Obregón was planning an armed uprising against the Carranza regime. Obregón was forced to disguise himself as a railwayman and flee to [[Guerrero]], where one of his former subordinates, [[:es:Fortunato Maycotte|Fortunato Maycotte]], was [[Governor of Guerrero|governor]]. When the election was held, Bonillas defeated Obregón.&lt;ref name="krauze390"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 390|page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1920, Obregón issued a declaration in the town of [[Chilpancingo]] accusing Carranza of having used public money in support of Bonillas's presidential candidacy. He declared his allegiance to the [[Governor of Sonora]], [[Adolfo de la Huerta]], in revolution against the Carranza regime.&lt;ref name="krauze390"/&gt;

On 23 April, the Sonorans issued the [[Plan of Agua Prieta]], which triggered a military revolt against the president. Obregón's Sonoran forces were augmented by troops under General [[Benjamín G. Hill]] and the Zapatistas led by [[Gildardo Magaña]] and [[Genovevo de la O]].

The revolt was successful and Carranza was deposed. On 20 May 1920, Carranza was killed in the state of [[Puebla]] in an ambush led by General [[Rodolfo Herrero]] as he fled from [[Mexico City]] to [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] on horseback.

For six months, from 1 June 1920 to 1 December 1920, Adolfo de la Huerta served as provisional president of Mexico until elections could be held.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; When Obregón was declared the victor, de la Huerta stepped down and assumed the position of Secretary of the Treasury in the new government.

==President of Mexico, 1920–1924==
Obregón's election as president essentially signaled the end of the violence of the Mexican Revolution. The death of [[Lucio Blanco]] in 1922 and the assassination of Pancho Villa in 1923 would eliminate the last remaining obvious challenges to Obregón's regime. He pursued what seem to be contradictory policies during his administration.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Friedrich. ''The Life and Times of Pancho Villa'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1998, 730–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational reforms and cultural developments===
Obregón appointed [[José Vasconcelos]] (Rector of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] who had been in exile 1915–1920 because of his opposition to Carranza) as his [[Secretary of Public Education]].&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasconcelos undertook a major effort to construct new schools across the country. Around 1,000 rural schools and 2,000 public libraries were built.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Michael C. and Sherman, William L. ''The Course of Mexican History''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasconcelos was also interested in promoting artistic developments that created a narrative of Mexico's history and the Mexican Revolution. Obregón's time as president saw the beginning of the [[art movement]] of [[Mexican muralism]], with artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[Roberto Montenegro]] invited to create murals expressive of the spirit of the Mexican Revolution on the walls of public buildings throughout Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 394|page=394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obregón also sought to shape public perceptions of the Revolution and its place in history by staging elaborate celebrations in 1921 on the centenary of Mexico's independence from Spain.  There had been such celebrations in 1910 by the Díaz regime, commemorating the start of the insurgency by [[Miguel Hidalgo]]. The political fact of independence was achieved by former royalist officer [[Agustín de Iturbide]], who was more celebrated by conservatives in post-independence Mexico than liberals. However, 1921 provided a date for Obregon's government to shape historical memory of independence and the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, Michael J. "Imagining Mexico in 1921: Visions of the Revolutionary State and Society in the Centennial Celebration in Mexico City", ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'' vol. 25, (2) 2009, pp. 247–270.&lt;/ref&gt; After a decade of violence during the Revolution, the centennial celebrations provided an opportunity for Mexicans to reflect on their history and identity, as well as to enjoy diversions in peacetime. For Obregón, the centennial was a way to emphasize that revolutionary initiatives had historical roots and that like independence, the Revolution presented new opportunities for Mexicans.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, "Imagining Mexico in 1921", p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Obregón "intended to use the occasion to shore-up popular support for the government, and, by extension, the revolution itself."&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, "Imagining Mexico in 1921", p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the centennial celebrations in 1910, the one of 1921 had no monumental architecture to inaugurate.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, "Imagining Mexico in 1921", pp. 253–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor relations===
Obregón kept his August 1919 agreement with [[Luis Napoleón Morones]] and the [[Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers]] (CROM) and created a Department of Labor, installed a labor-friendly Minister of Industry and Commerce, and issued a new labor law.&lt;ref name="krauze395"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 395|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Luis napoleon morones.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|Luis N. Morones in 1925]]
Morones and CROM became increasingly powerful in the early 1920s and it would have been very difficult for Obregón to oppose their increased power. Morones was not afraid to use violence against his competitors, nearly eliminating the [[General Confederation of Workers (Mexico)|General Confederation of Workers]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="krauze395"/&gt;

CROM's success did not necessarily translate to success for all of Mexico's workers, and [[Constitution of Mexico#Article 123|Article 123]] of the [[Constitution of Mexico]] was enforced only sporadically. Thus, while CROM's right to strike was recognized, non-CROM strikes were broken up by the police or the army. And few Mexican workers got Sundays off with pay, or were able to limit their workday to eight hours.&lt;ref name="krauze395"/&gt;

===Land reform===
Land reform was far more extensive under Obregón than it had been under Carranza. Obregón enforced the constitutional land redistribution provisions, and in total, 921,627 hectares of land were distributed during his presidency.&lt;ref name="krauze395"/&gt; However, Obregón was a successful commercial chickpea farmer in Sonora, and "did not believe in socialism or in land reform" and was in agreement with Madero and Carranza that "radical land reform might very well destroy the Mexican economy and lead to a return to subsistence agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;Katz, ''The Life and Times of Pancho Villa'', p. 731.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mexican Catholic Church during Obregón's presidency===
Many leaders and members of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico were highly critical of the 1917 constitution. They especially criticized [[Mexican constitution#Article 3|Article 3]], which forbade religious instruction in schools, and [[Mexican constitution#Article 130|Article 130]], which adopted an extreme form of [[separation of church and state]], including a series of restrictions on priests and ministers of all religions to hold public office, canvass on behalf of political parties or candidates, or to inherit from persons other than close blood relatives, etc.&lt;ref name="krauze395"/&gt;

Although Obregón was suspicious of the Catholic Church, he was less anticlerical than his successor, [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], whose policies would lead to the [[Cristero War]] (1926–29). For example, he sent [[Pope Pius XI]] congratulations upon his election in 1922 and, in a private message to the pope, emphasized the "complementarity" of the aims of the Catholic Church and the Mexican Revolution.&lt;ref name="krauze395"/&gt;

In spite of Obregón's moderate approach, his presidency saw the beginnings of clashes between Catholics and supporters of the Mexican Revolution. Some bishops campaigned actively against land distribution and against the organization of workers into secular [[trade union|unions]]. [[Catholic Action]] movements were founded in Mexico in the wake of Pius XI's 1922 [[encyclical]] ''[[Ubi arcano Dei consilio]]'', and supporters of the Young Mexican Catholic Action soon found themselves in violent conflict with CROM members.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|pp. 395–396|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most serious [[diplomatic incident]] occurred in 1923, when [[Ernesto Filippi]], the [[Apostolic Nuncio to Mexico]], conducted an open air religious service in spite of the fact that it was illegal to hold a religious service outside a church. The government invoked [[Mexican Constitution#Article 33|Article 33]] of the constitution and expelled Filippi from Mexico.&lt;ref name="krauze396"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 396|page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico-U.S. relations===
As president, one of Obregón's top priorities was securing US [[diplomatic recognition]] of his regime, to resume normal [[Mexico–United States relations]]. Although he rejected the U.S. demand that Mexico rescind [[Mexican Constitution#Article 27|Article 27]] of the constitution, Obregón negotiated a major agreement with the United States, the [[Bucareli Treaty]] of August 1923 that made some concessions to the US in order to gain diplomatic recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, ''U.S. and Mexico'', pp. 207–208.&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly helpful when the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Mexican Supreme Court]], in a case brought by [[Texas Oil]], declared that Article 27 did not apply retroactively. Another important arena in which Obregón resolved issues with the U.S. and other foreign governments was the Mexican-United States General Claims Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, ''U.S. and Mexico'', pp. 208–210.&lt;/ref&gt; Finance Minister Adolfo de la Huerta signed a deal in which Mexico recognized a debt of $1.451&amp;nbsp;million to international bankers. Finally, at the Bucareli Conference, Obregón agreed to an American demand that Mexico would not [[expropriate]] any foreign oil companies, and in exchange, the U.S. recognized his government. Many Mexicans criticized Obregón as a sellout (''entreguista''), including [[Adolfo de la Huerta]] for his actions at the Bucareli Conference.&lt;ref name="krauze396"/&gt;

===The de la Huerta rebellion, 1923–24===
[[Image:Adolfo de la Huerta.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Adolfo de la Huerta]] (1881–1955), the former [[Governor of Sonora]] under whose banner Obregón purportedly fought in 1920, and who served as Obregón's Finance Minister before launching a rebellion in 1923.]]
In 1923, Obregón endorsed [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] for president in the 1924 election (in which Obregón was not eligible to run). Finance Minister Adolfo de la Huerta (who had served as interim president in 1920, before stepping aside in favor of Obregón) believed that he deserved to be the next president and that Obregón was repeating Carranza's mistake of imposing his own candidate on the country. De la Huerta therefore accepted the nomination of the Cooperativist Party to be its candidate in the presidential elections.&lt;ref name="krauze397"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 397|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De la Huerta then organized an uprising against Obregón. Over half of the army joined De la Huerta's rebellion, with many of Obregón's former comrades in arms now turning on him. Rebel forces massed in Veracruz and Jalisco.&lt;ref name="krauze397"/&gt;

In a decisive battle at [[Ocotlán, Jalisco]], Obregón's forces crushed the rebel forces. Diplomatic recognition by the United States following the signing of the 1923 [[Bucareli Treaty]] was significant in Obregón's victory over rebels. The U.S. supplied Obregón arms, but also aided him by sending 17 U.S. planes that bombed rebels in Jalisco.&lt;ref name="Cline, p. 208"/&gt; Obregón hunted down many of his former friends and had them executed.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 398|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the crushing of the rebellion, Calles was elected president of Mexico and Obregón stepped down from office.

==Later years, 1924–1928==
Following the election of Calles as president, Obregón returned to [[Sonora]] to farm. He led an "agricultural revolution" in the [[Yaqui Valley]], where he introduced modern [[irrigation]]. Obregón expanded his business interests to include a [[rice mill]] in [[Cajeme]], a seafood [[Fish processing|packing plant]], a soap factory, tomato fields, a [[car rental]] business, and a [[jute]] bag factory.&lt;ref name="krauze399"&gt;Krauze, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

Obregón remained in close contact with President Calles, whom he had installed as his successor, and was a frequent guest of Calles at [[Chapultepec Castle]]. This prompted fears that Obregón was intending to follow in the footsteps of [[Porfirio Díaz]] and that Calles was merely a puppet figure, the equivalent of [[Manuel González Flores|Manuel González]]. These fears became acute in October 1926, when the Mexican Congress repealed [[term limit]]s, thus clearing the way for Obregón to run for president in 1928.&lt;ref name="krauze399"/&gt;

Obregón returned to the battlefield for the period October 1926 to April 1927 to put down a rebellion led by the [[Yaqui]] people. This was somewhat ironic because Obregón had first risen to military prominence commanding Yaqui troops, to whom he promised land, and the 1926–27 Yaqui rebellion was a demand for land reform. In all likelihood, Obregón participated in this campaign in order to prove his loyalty to the Calles government, to show his continued influence over the military, and also to protect his commercial interests in the Yaqui Valley, which had begun to suffer as a result of the increasing violence in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Buchenau, pp. 150–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Obregón formally began his presidential campaign in May 1927. CROM and a large part of public opinion were against his re-election, but he still counted on the support of most of the army and of the National Agrarian Party.

Two of Obregón's oldest allies, General Arnulfo R. Gómez and General Francisco "Pancho" Serrano, opposed his re-election. Serrano launched an anti-Obregón rebellion and was ultimately assassinated. Gómez later called for an insurrection against Obregón, but was soon killed as well.&lt;ref name="krauze401"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 401|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-election and assassination===
Obregón won the 1928 Mexican presidential election, but months before assuming the presidency he was assassinated. Calles's harsh treatment of Roman Catholics had led to a rebellion known as the [[Cristero War]], which broke out in 1926. As an ally of Calles, Obregón was hated by Catholics and was assassinated in [[Parque de la Bombilla (Mexico City)|La Bombilla Café]]&lt;ref&gt;"P&amp;A Photos #173503" - New York Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; on July 17, 1928, shortly after his return to Mexico City, by [[José de León Toral]], a Roman Catholic opposed to the government's anti-Catholic policies.&lt;ref name="krauze403"&gt;Krauze, {{Google books|sMIUcsUVyzsC|p. 403|page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Álvaro Obregón was awarded Japan's [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]] at a special ceremony in Mexico City. On November 26, 1924, Baron Shigetsuma Furuya, Special Ambassador from Japan to Mexico, conferred the honor on the President.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1924/11/28/archives/japan-decorates-obregon-order-of-the-chrysanthemum-conferred-by.html?sq=order+of+the+chrysanthemum+&amp;scp=3&amp;st=p "Japan Decorates Obregon; Order of the Chrysanthemum is Conferred by Special Ambassador"], ''New York Times'', 28 November 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and posthumous recognition==
Although Obregón was a gifted military strategist during the Revolution and decisively defeated [[Pancho Villa]]'s [[Division of the North]] at the [[Battle of Celaya]] and went on to become President of Mexico, his posthumous name recognition and standing as a hero of the Revolution is nowhere near that of Villa's or Emiliano Zapata's. As president, he successfully gained recognition from the United States in 1923, settled for a period the dispute with the U.S. over oil via the [[Bucareli Treaty]], gain full rein to his Secretary of Public Education, [[José Vasconcelos]], who expanded access to learning for Mexicans by building schools, but also via public art of the [[Mexican muralism|Mexican muralists]]. Perhaps as with Porfirio Díaz, Obregón saw himself as indispensable to the nation and had the Constitution of 1917 amended so that he could run again for the presidency in Mexico. This bent and, in many people's minds, violated the revolutionary rule "no re-election" that had been enshrined in the constitution.

His assassination in 1928 before he could take the presidential office created a major political crisis in Mexico, which was solved by the creation of the National Revolutionary Party by his fellow Sonoran, General and former President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]].

An imposing monument to Álvaro Obregón is located in the [[Parque de la Bombilla (Mexico City)|Parque de la Bombilla]], Avenida Miguel Ángel de Quevedo at [[Avenida de los Insurgentes|Insurgentes]], [[San Ángel]], Mexico City. The area around it is now a political jurisdiction of Mexico City, [[Álvaro Obregón, D.F.]] The monument to Obregón is the largest to a single revolutionary. It was constructed in the place where Obregón was assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mytravelguide.com/attractions/profile-79071705-Mexico_Mexico_City_Monumento_al_General_Alvaro_Obregon.html "Monumento al General Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City", MyTravelGuide.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The monument held Obregón severed, and over the years, increasingly deteriorating right arm that he lost in 1915. The monument now has a marble sculpture of the severed arm, after the arm itself was incinerated in 1989. Obregón's body after his 1928 assassination is buried in [[Huatabampo]], Sonora, rather than the [[Monument to the Revolution]] in downtown Mexico City where other revolutionaries are now entombed. In Sonora, Obregón is honored with an equestrian statue, where he is shown as a vigorous soldier with two arms.

In Sonora, the second largest city, [[Ciudad Obregón]] is named for the revolutionary leader. Obregón's son [[Álvaro Obregón Tapia]] served one term as the governor of Sonora as a candidate for the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], founded following Obregón's assassination. The [[Álvaro Obregón Dam]], built near Ciudad Obregón, became operational during the gubernatorial term of Obregón's son.

Obregón is honored in the name of a [[genus]] of small cactus indigenous to Mexico – ''[[Obregonia denegrii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eggli, Urs ''et al.'' (2004). {{Google books|u2n5vusQ1DEC|Etymological Dictionary of Succulent Plant Names, pp. 169, 64|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the novel ''The Friends of Pancho Villa'' (1996) by [[James Carlos Blake]], Obregón is a major character.

Obregón is also featured in the novel ''Il collare spezzato'' by Italian writer [[Valerio Evangelisti]] (2006).

Obregón's legacy and lost limb are the subjects of Mexican-American singer-songwriter [[El Vez]]'s "The Arm of Obregón", from his 1996 album ''G.I. Ay! Ay! Blues''.&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0000079627|tab=review |label="El Vez: G.I. Ay! Ay! Blues" |first= Kembrew |last= McLeod |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
