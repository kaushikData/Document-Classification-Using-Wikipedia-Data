'''Bao Tong''' (born November 1932) is a Chinese writer and activist. He was former Director of the [[Central Policy Research Office|Office of Political Reform]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] and the Policy Secretary of [[Zhao Ziyang]], [[Chinese Premier]] from 1980 to 1987 and [[CPC General Secretary]] from 1987 to 1989. He was also Director of the Drafting Committee for the CPC 13th [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congresses]], known for its strong support for market reform and opening up under [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Prior to this, he was a committee member and then Deputy Director of the Chinese State Commission for Economic Reform.

==Biography==
Bao was born in [[Haining]], [[Zhejiang]] Province, but grew up in Shanghai. He currently lives in Beijing with his wife Jiang Zongcao, his daughter Bao Jian, and granddaughter Bao Yangyang. His son, Bao Pu, lives abroad.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Bao was Director of the [[Central Policy Research Office|Office of Political Reform]] of the [[CPC Central Committee]] and the Policy Secretary of [[Zhao Ziyang]], Chinese Premier from 1980 to 1987 and CPC General Secretary from 1987 to 1989. He was also Director of the Drafting Committee for the CPC 13th [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congresses]], prior to which he was a committee member and then Deputy Director of the Chinese State Commission for Economic Reform.

On May 28, 1989, he was arrested in Beijing just before the crushing of the democracy movement in [[Tiananmen Square]] on [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|June 4, 1989]]. Zhao Ziyang had resigned as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] in protest when [[Deng Xiaoping]] made the decision to crack down on the students. Bao Tong was a close associate of Zhao and the writer of his speeches and editorials supporting a democratic and legal approach to the student movement. Zhao was held under house arrest for the rest of his life, while Bao Tong was officially charged with "revealing state secrets and counter-revolutionary propagandizing", the highest government official to be charged in relation to the 1989 movement. He was publicly convicted in 1992 in a brief show trial and sentenced to 7 seven years' imprisonment with 2 years deprivation of political rights. He served his full sentence in isolation at [[Qincheng Prison]].

On May 27, 1996, when he was due to be released upon completing his prison sentence, he was instead held at a government compound in Xishan (outside Beijing) for an additional year, until his family agreed to move out of their apartment in town to one allocated for them by the authorities, where a 24-hour guarded gate and surveillance cameras were installed. Visitors were screened, the phone was tapped or cut off entirely, and Bao Tong was followed by an entourage of men the moment he stepped out of his home. Though he has moved to another apartment in Beijing, the system of surveillance and curtailing his phone calls, visitors and movements has followed him to his new home.

Bao Tong appealed for the restoration of civil and political rights of Zhao Ziyang from 1998 until Zhao's death. He was instrumental to the publication in May 2009 of Zhao Ziyang's memoir, based on audiotapes that Zhao made secretly while under house arrest and discovered after his death in 2005. Bao Tong's son Bao Pu, and daughter-in-law Renee Chiang, published the book ''Journey of Reform'' ([[:zh:改革历程|改革歷程]]) in Hong Kong and translated and edited (along with [[Adi Ignatius]]) an English version of this book entitled [[Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang]]. Bao Tong wrote an introduction for the Chinese version.

Bao Tong continues to write articles openly critical of the government and its policies. He supports further democratic development in Hong Kong and continues to voice the need for political reform in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.chinaaffairs.org/gb/ArticleList.asp?writerID=74 | title = Writers' columns - Bao Tong |accessdate = August 1, 2006  | publisher = Chinaaffairs.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a signer of the [[Charter 08]] manifesto and calls for the release of [[Liu Xiaobo]], an organiser of the charter who was arrested in December 2008.

On January 19, 2005, the Washington Post reported that Bao Tong and his wife were injured in attacks by more than 20 plainclothes security agents as they attempted to leave their home to pay their respect to the family of Zhao Ziyang, who died on January 17. The authorities would only allow him access to a doctor if he removed a white flower pinned to his vest. He refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiaamerica.org/Backup/ChinaInFocus.html |title=China in Focus #1 |date=January 20, 2005 |publisher=asiaamerica.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523032924/http://www.asiaamerica.org/Backup/ChinaInFocus.html |archivedate=May 23, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Note that the white flower is a traditional symbol of mourning'') His wife, pushed to the ground by a policeman, fractured a bone in her spine that had her hospitalized for 3 months.

On January 1, 2007, Reuters tested a new government relaxing of regulations on foreign reporters by visiting Bao Tong at his home, purportedly to conduct an interview about the Beijing Olympics. Since then, several foreign reporters have done the same. The guards sometimes attempt to intimidate or deny visitation, but are apparently allowing most foreign reporters to enter, if prior arrangements are made. Local Chinese reporters are not included in this new relaxation of regulations.
Sky News reporter Peter Sharp describes his visit to Bao Tong in his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://skynews6.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/01/in-the-tiananme.html| title = In A Tiananmen Rebel's Glass Prison | date = January 17, 2008  | publisher = sky.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their home telephone continues to be tapped and periodically cut off, especially when overseas callers ask to speak to Bao Tong. He is followed everywhere he goes, and is occasionally blocked from “sensitive” events or places, for example, the home of Zhao Ziyang while he was alive, and his funeral after his death in 2005. Bao has been allowed to leave Beijing on three occasions since his arrest in 1989, the last time in 2009 for a holiday by invitation and escort of the Public Security from May 22 to June 7, neatly avoiding the 20th anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Massacre]]. Visits from his son, Bao Pu, a resident of Hong Kong, are permitted by special arrangements only; under normal circumstances of application, he is unable to obtain a visa.

* On CPC leadership: "We must correct all of Deng Xiaoping's mistakes. This is the only way to truly uphold Deng Xiaoping's vision. This is what it truly means to carry on Deng Xiaoping's work. Only when they acknowledge his mistakes and correct his mistakes can they stand taller than Deng Xiaoping. Otherwise they have no right to call themselves Deng Xiaoping's successors. They can only call themselves the successors of Deng Xiaoping's mistakes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9906/02/tiananmen/MacKinnon/bao.tong.html | title = Former Community Party official: Last decade 'wasted' | date = June 2, 1999  | work = Rebecca McKinnon | publisher = CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* On mourning Zhao Ziyang: "[his] life formed part of a heroic and mighty task, that of pioneering the protection of human rights and democracy for the Chinese people...

* On the [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]]: "The tainted milk scandal shows us that the more dark secrets are exposed, the better. You can't cure the disease, or save the Chinese people, until you get to the root of the problem." "If the Chinese government tries to play down this incident, there will be no social stability in China, let alone harmony... It will mean that this government has lost the most basic level of trust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/milk-09232008075809.html?searchterm=None |title= Uproar Over China Milk Scandal |publisher= [[Radio Free Asia]]|date= September 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beatrice Long Visitor Holy Dance''' is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] spiritual [[American Indian elder|elder]] who is a member of the [[Oglala Lakota]] Tribe and comes from the [[Pine Ridge Reservation]] in South Dakota. Beatrice has gained international recognition through her work with the Council of the [[International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers]] - a group of women elders, [[Medicine man|medicine women]] and wisdom keepers founded in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Beatrice was sent to a [[Roman Catholic]] boarding school at age 7. She waited for her younger sister [[Rita Long Visitor Holy Dance|Rita]] to wed and the two enjoyed a double wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a "[[Native American Church]] elder, sundancer, and health worker for people with diabetes," and works on a Youth Ambassador program with her sister to connect young people with spirituality and the [[Sun Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

{{quote|Among Beatrice's themes in her talks is forgiveness, something she has experience with. As a child, she watched as Christian missionaries stamped out the Lakota faith, and the federal government rounded up Lakotas and placed them on reservations.

She also endured the murders of two of her children, one in 1994 and another in 2007. "I pray for the people who did that to them," Beatrice told me. "I pray that they have a clean soul and will someday be in the Creator's arms."&lt;ref name = "gazette"&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have to keep repeating the prayers over and over again. When I reflect on my life of 79 years, I see a flat road of destruction. Youths are dying of drugs and ozone layer is depleting. The most powerful tool with us is to pray and pray with other communities for world peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

== The International Council of 13 Grandmothers ==
{{Main|International Council of 13 Grandmothers}}
In 2004, Beatrice was approached by [[The Center for Sacred Studies]] to serve on the [[International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers]].&lt;ref&gt;Supriano, S, (2009-04-06)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] described her schedule with the Grandmothers as "hectic", noting that she traveled by "Greyhound bus or car, driven by her daughter Loretta Long Visitor."&lt;ref name = "gazette"/&gt;

In 2008, she joined the Grandmothers in delivering a petition to [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in [[Vatican City]] by hand, requesting the Pope to revoke the three papal bulls authorizing the conversion and subjugation of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Capriccioso, R, Jul 17, 2008 (Updated: Apr 24, 2009), [http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/28396744.html ''Indigenous grandmas nearly kicked out of Vatican'']. [[Indian Country Today Media Network|Indian Country Today]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Papal Bulls that the Grandmothers are demanding to be revoked are:
*[[Dum Diversas]], June 18, 1452
*[[Romanus Pontifex]], January 8, 1455
*[[Inter Caetera]], May 4, 1493&lt;ref&gt;Chittister (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Grandmothers received no response after this request.

However, the letter which Beatrice Long Visitor Holy Dance wrote on this topic was featured on the [[National Catholic Reporter]] website, under the title "The past is a very living thing: Try not to forget it."&lt;ref&gt;Chittister, J, April 24, 2009, Blog on [[National Catholic Reporter]] website, [http://ncronline.org/blogs/where-i-stand/past-very-living-thing-try-not-forget-it ''The past is a very living thing: Try not to forget it''].&lt;/ref&gt;

She was interviewed on her work with the Council by the Women Rising Radio Project in 2011.&lt;ref name = "womenrising"&gt;{{Cite web

Hedges received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in English from [[Colgate University]] in 1979. He received a [[Master of Divinity]] degree from [[Harvard Divinity School]] (where he studied under [[James Luther Adams]]) in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week622/hedges.html |title=Interview: Chris Hedges |publisher=PBS |date=January 31, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310151925/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week622/hedges.html |archivedate=March 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and studied [[Latin]] and [[Classical Greek]] at Harvard.&lt;ref name="Chrisbiotruthdig"/&gt;

== ''The New York Times'' ==

Hedges worked for 15 years as a foreign correspondent for ''[[The New York Times]]''. He was based in the Middle East for five years, serving for four of those years as the Middle East bureau chief. He covered the war in the former Yugoslavia as the Balkan bureau chief based in Sarajevo. He later covered [[Al Qaeda]] in Europe and the Middle East from Paris.

Three of Hedges' articles were based upon the stories of Iraqi defectors, who had been furnished to Hedges by the Information Collection Program of the U.S.-funded [[Iraqi National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0316-02.htm Jonathan S. Landay and Tish Wells, "Global Misinformation Campaign was Used to Build Case for War" ''Knight-Ridder'', March 16, 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117010917/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0316-02.htm |date=November 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program promoted stories to major media outlets in order to orchestrate U.S. intervention in Iraq in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]]. Most significant of his reports in this period was a November 8, 2001, front-page story about two former [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|Iraqi military commanders who claimed to have trained foreign mujahedeen]] how to hijack planes without using guns.&lt;ref name='alternet'&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.alternet.org/story/19210/ahmed_chalabi's_list_of_suckers | first = Douglas | last = McCollam | title = Ahmed Chalabi's List of Suckers: Judith Miller is only one of the many reporters from almost every blue-blooded news outfit in America who were played by the Iraqi exile | date = July 12, 2004| work = [[Alternet]] | accessdate = 2013-11-22 | quote = Chris Hedges of ''The New York Times'' wrote a page-one piece headlined "Defectors Cite Iraqi Training for Terrorism".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hedges quoted a man whom he believed to be an Iraqi general: "These Islamic radicals ... came from a variety of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco. We were training these people to attack installations important to the United States". The two defectors also asserted there was a secret compound in [[Salman Pak facility]] where a German scientist was producing biological weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/08/international/middleeast/08IRAQ.html%20| first = Chris | last = Hedges | title = Defectors Cite Iraqi Training for Terrorism | date = November 8, 2001 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'': "The impact of the article ... was immediate: Op-eds ran in major papers, and the story was taken to a wider audience through cable-TV talk shows. When [[Condoleezza Rice]], then George W. Bush's national security adviser, was asked about the report at a press briefing, she said, 'I think it surprises no one that Saddam Hussein is engaged in all kinds of activities that are destabilizing.{{'"}} As late as 2006, conservative magazines including ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' and ''[[National Review]]'' continued to use this article to justify the invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref name='heroes in error'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jack | last = Fairweather | title = Heroes in Error | date = March 2006 | url = https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/03/heroes-error | work = [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]| accessdate = 2013-11-17 | quote = How a fake general, a pliant media, and a master manipulator helped lead the United States into war.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It later was revealed that the story which Hedges reported was "an elaborate scam". The defector whom Hedges quoted, who had identified himself as Lt. General Jamal al-Ghurairy, was a former sergeant. The real Ghurairy had never left Iraq. Hedges said that he had taken on reporting this account at the request of [[Lowell Bergman]] of ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV program)|Frontline]]'', who wanted the defectors for his show but could not go to Beirut for the interview. The trip had been organized by [[Ahmed Chalabi]], whom Hedges considered to be unreliable. Hedges said he had done the piece as a favor to Bergman, explaining, "There has to be a level of trust between reporters. We cover each other's sources when it's a good story because otherwise everyone would get hold of it." Hedges had relied on the U.S. embassy in Turkey for further confirmation of the man's identity.&lt;ref name="heroes in error"/&gt;

Hedges wrote two more articles that year that were informed by Chalabi-coached defectors. The second one, claiming that Iraq still held 80 Kuwaitis captured in the 1991 Gulf War in a secret underground prison, was also found to be baseless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0316-02.htm |author1=Jonathan S.

==Political views and activism==
Hedges was an early critic of the [[Iraq War]]. In May 2003, Hedges delivered a commencement address at [[Rockford University|Rockford College]] in Rockford, Illinois, saying: "We are embarking on an occupation that, if history is any guide, will be as damaging to our souls as it will be to our prestige and power and security."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|SAWMgYyAtHU|Footage of the speech}}; Rockford College, May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; His speech was received with boos and his microphone was shut off three minutes after he began speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2003/5/21/new_york_times_reporter_chris_hedges|title=New York Times Reporter, Chris Hedges was Booed off the Stage and had his Microphone Cut Twice as he Delivered a Graduation Speech on War and Empire at Rockford College in Illinois |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=May 21, 2014 |accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'', his employer, criticized his statements and issued him a formal reprimand for "public remarks that could undermine public trust in the paper's impartiality".&lt;ref name="dallas"&gt;Hedges, Chris; [http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/DN-main_17rel.ART.State.Edition1.21b687c.html A Father's Gift], ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', 17 June 2006, accessed December 21, 2010 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the incident, Hedges left ''The New York Times'' to become a senior fellow at [[The Nation Institute]], and a columnist at [[Truthdig]], in addition to writing books and teaching inmates at a New Jersey correctional institution.&lt;ref name="dallas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationinstitute.org/fellows/1328/chris_hedges The Nation Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 United States presidential campaign, Hedges was a speech writer for candidate [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://progressive.org/chris_hedges_interview.html |author=David Barsamian |title=An Interview with Chris Hedges |date=August 2011 |work=The Progressive |accessdate=November 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204135757/http://www.progressive.org/chris_hedges_interview.html |archivedate=December 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his December 29, 2008, column for Truthdig, Hedges stated that "[t]he inability to articulate a viable socialism has been our gravest mistake. It will ensure, if this does not soon change, a ruthless [[Inverted totalitarianism|totalitarian capitalism]]".&lt;ref name=socialist/&gt; He elaborated upon this in a 2013 interview with The Real News, claiming that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the left has been destroyed, especially the [[Far-left politics|radical left]], quite consciously in the whole name of [[Anti-communism#United States|anti-communism]]", and "we have allowed ourselves to embrace an ideology which, at its core, states that all governance is about maximizing corporate profit at the expense of the citizenry. For what do we have structures of government, for what do we have institutions of state, if not to hold up all the citizenry, and especially the most vulnerable?".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/chris_hedges_the_left_has_been_destroyed_20130722/?ln Chris Hedges: 'The Left Has Been Destroyed'].

In a March 2009 column, Hedges warned that [[Human overpopulation|human over-population]] and [[Holocene extinction|mass species extinction]] are serious problems, and that any measures to save the ecosystem will be futile unless we cut population growth, and noted that, "As long as the Earth is viewed as the personal property of the human race, a belief embraced by everyone from born-again Christians to Marxists to free-market economists, we are destined to soon inhabit a biological wasteland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.truthdig.com/articles/we-are-breeding-ourselves-to-extinction/|title=We Are Breeding Ourselves to Extinction|last=Hedges |first=Chris |date=March 9, 2009|website= Truthdig|publisher= |access-date= January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2009, Hedges identified as a "radical Keynesian" during his lecture at [[The New School]], entitled "Empire of Illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EpeF1fcji0|title=Chris Hedges' Empire of Illusion {{!}} The New School|last=Hedges|first=Chris|date=December 16, 2009|website=''[[YouTube]]''|publisher=[[The New School]]|access-date=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2010, Hedges was arrested outside the White House along with [[Daniel Ellsberg]] and more than 100 activists who were protesting the war in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/hope_is_action_hedges_ellsberg_arrested_at_white_house_protest_20101217 |title='Hope Is Action': Hedges and Ellsberg Arrested at White House Protest|publisher=Truthdig|date=2010-12-17|accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/12/untitled-chris-hedges-interview/ | title=Exclusive: US empire could collapse at any time, Pulitzer winner tells Raw Story |publisher=[[The Raw Story]]|date=December 17, 2010|accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hedges appeared as a guest on an October 2011 episode of the [[CBC News Network]]'s ''[[Lang and O'Leary Exchange]]'' to discuss his support for the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests; co-host [[Kevin O'Leary]] criticized him, saying that he sounded "like a left-wing nutbar". Hedges said "it will be the last time" he appears on the show, and compared the CBC to [[Fox News]].&lt;ref&gt;James Crugnale (October 12, 2011).

On September 20, 2014, a day before the [[People's Climate March]], Hedges joined [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Bill McKibben]], and [[Kshama Sawant]] on a panel moderated by WNYC's [[Brian Lehrer]] to discuss the issue of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=12411&amp;updaterx=2014-09-21+13%3A06%3A09 "It's Time to Act on the Climate Crisis"].

On November 11, 2014, Hedges published an article explaining why he and his family have become [[Veganism|vegan]]. He explained that this is "the most important and direct change we can immediately make to save the planet and its species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/saving_the_planet_one_meal_at_a_time_20141109|title=Saving the Planet, One Meal at a Time|publisher=Truthdig|date=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a December 15, 2014, article, Hedges compared the actions of [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria|ISIS]] today to the way [[Israel]]'s founding fathers acted in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hedges|first1=Chris|title=ISIS-The New Israel|url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/isis_--_the_new_israel_20141214|website=TruthDig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hedges contended at the Left Forum in 2015 that with the "denouement of capitalism and the disintegration of globalism", [[Karl Marx]] has been "vindicated as capitalism's most prescient and important critic". He said that Marx "foresaw that capitalism had built within it the seeds of its own destruction. He knew that reigning ideologies—think [[neoliberalism]]—were created to serve the interests of the elites and in particular the economic elites."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Hedges (May 31, 2015).

On April 15, 2016, Hedges was arrested, along with 100 other protesters, during a sit-in outside the U.S. Capitol during [[Democracy Spring]] to protest the capture of the political system by corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcmediagroup.us/2016/04/15/rosario-dawson-arrested-100-democracy-spring-protesters-u-s-capitol|title=Rosario Dawson Among 100 Democracy Spring Protesters Arrested at U.S. Capitol|publisher=DCMediaGroup|date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the 2016 election during an interview on [[The Real News]], Hedges asserted that the modern American Left's embrace of neoliberalism resulted in a dysfunctional democracy and has given rise to a Trump presidency, which he characterizes as "[[Proto-fascism|proto-fascist]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=17650 Chris Hedges: The Surrender of the Liberal Left to Neoliberalism Gave Us Proto-fascism].

&lt;blockquote&gt;This resistance must also be accompanied by an alternative vision of a socialist, anti-capitalist society. Because the enemy in the end is not Trump or Bannon—it is corporate power. And if we do not stop corporate power, we will never dismantle fascism's seduction of the white working class and unemployed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/chris_hedges_enemy_donald_trump_or_steve_bannon_corporate_power_20170315 Chris Hedges: The Enemy Is Not Donald Trump or Steve Bannon—It Is Corporate Power (Video)] Truthdig.

==NDAA lawsuit==
{{Main|Hedges v. Obama}}

In 2012, after the Obama Administration signed the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012|National Defense Authorization Act]], or NDAA, Hedges sued members of the U.S. government, claiming that section 1021 of the law unconstitutionally allowed presidential authority for indefinite detention without ''[[habeas corpus]]''. He was later joined in the suit, ''[[Hedges v. Obama]]'', by activists including [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Daniel Ellsberg]]. In May 2012 Judge [[Katherine B. Forrest]] of the Southern District of New York ruled that the counter-terrorism provision of the NDAA is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kuipers|first=Dean|title=Federal judge blocks National Defense Authorization Act provision |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/environment/la-me-gs-national-defense-authorization-ruling-20120518,0,2046039.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Obama administration appealed the decision and it was overturned.

'''Dorothy Brooke''' (1 June 1883 – 10 June 1955) was the founder of The Old War Horse Memorial Hospital in 1934 in [[Cairo]] – renamed [[Brooke Hospital for Animals|The Brooke Hospital for Animals]] in 1961. Developing from a single operation in Cairo into one of the world’s largest [[horse|equines]] welfare organisations, at work in many countries, with headquarters in London, it is known today as Brooke.

==Early life==
Dorothy Brooke was born Dorothy Evelyn Gibson-Craig on 1 June 1883 in the Cathedral Close at [[Salisbury]], [[Wiltshire]], [[England]]. She was the daughter of Henry Vivian and Emily Dulcibella (Wilmot) Gibson-Craig. Her grandfather was the Rt. Hon. Sir [[William Gibson-Craig]] of [[Riccarton, Edinburgh|Riccarton]].&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mosley|editor1-first=Charles|title=Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knightage|date=2003|publisher=[[Burke's Peerage]] (Genealogical Books) Ltd|edition=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her childhood was spent in [[Scotland]], Wiltshire and [[Hampshire]]. By family and friends, she was always called Dodo.&lt;ref name=the_brooke&gt;{{cite web|title=Dorothy Brooke|url=http://www.thebrooke.org/about-us/our-history/dorothy-brooke|website=Brooke Hospital for Animals|publisher=Brooke Hospital for Animals|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was first married in 1905 to Lt.-Col. James Gerald Lamb Searight, The [[Royal Scots]] (Lothian Regiment). They were divorced in 1926.&lt;ref name=Burke /&gt;

In 1926 Brooke married again, to Major-General Geoffrey Francis Heremon Brooke, C.B., D.S.O., M.C. (1884–1966), 16th/5th Lancers.&lt;ref name=Burke /&gt; Geoffrey Brooke was a recognised horse expert and author. Among his many titles are Horse-Sense and Horsemanship of Today (1924); Horse Lovers (1927); Horsemanship: The Way of a Man with a Horse (1929); and Good Company (1954). He trained and rode his own [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]]rs, he was a [[polo|polo-player]] and [[Show jumping|show-jumper]]. He competed as a member of the British equestrian team in the [[Equestrian at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Summer Olympics]], although he had broken his collarbone a few days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;p204 Geoffrey Brooke, 'Good Company'&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooke had three children: Rodney Gerald Searight, born 1909; Pamela Searight, born 1915; and John Philip Searight, born 1917.

==Life in Cairo==
In 1930, Geoffrey Brooke was appointed to the command of the British Cavalry Brigade in Egypt. It was at this time that Dorothy Brooke realised she would have to search for the old war horses, whom “she hated to remember yet could not forget”.&lt;ref&gt;p. 4, pb ed., [[Glenda Spooner]] (edit.), For Love of Horses, Diaries of Mrs Geoffrey Brooke&lt;/ref&gt; She could not be in Egypt and fail to do so. She had been devoted to horses since her childhood.

==War Horses in Cairo==
In 1919, the cavalry, artillery and draught horses that had served in the British Army in the Egypt and Palestine campaigns of [[World War I]] had been sold in their many thousands to a life of continuous hard labour and a painful old age. Many had been requisitioned in England and had served in the [[British yeomanry during the First World War|British Yeomanry]]. Some had seen active service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] before being drafted as remounts to the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 166, Marquess of Anglesey, A HIstory of the British Cavalry, Vol. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Strict [[quarantine]] restrictions prevented the repatriation of the horses of the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Infantry.

During World War I, horses cast from the veterinary hospitals had initially been sold to Egyptian dealers. British residents in Cairo had protested so forcefully that this practice had been stopped.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 172-3, Maj.-Gen. Sir L.J. Blenkinsop and Lieut.-Col. J.W. Ramsey, History of the Great War based on Official Documents: Veterinary Services&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Armistice, however, with 22,000 horses, mostly in Palestine and Sinai, requiring transport or disposal, the Remounts Directorate of the [[War Office]] ordered the local sale of all animals of 12 years and under that were deemed up to some work. Those over 12 and the unsound were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 681-691, Blenkinsop, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving horses had not had an easy war. They had carried often far too much weight – up to {{convert|22|stone|kg}}. They had experienced rationing, withstood piercing cold, dust clouds and exhaustion. Some may also have suffered both severe and light wounds. They had covered great distances, and some had endured a summer in the heat of the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 94-95 &amp; 311-321, Lieut.-Col. R.M.P. Preston, The Desert Mounted Corps; pp. 188, 202-203, 233, 341, Anglesey, op. cit., Vol. 5; pp. 640-642, Capt. Cyril Falls, History of the Great War: Military Operations based on Official Documents, Egypt &amp; Palestine, Part II, Vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1930, twelve years later, the war horses, many now of an advanced age, had been lost to view, toiling for the very poorest owners, or at night to avoid the police and Egyptian [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|S.P.C.A.]], or in the stone [[quarry|quarries]]. Brooke had heard rumours from British residents who spoke of pitiful, emaciated creatures that they suspected were war horses. Their condition was said to be so bad that people could hardly bear to look at them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Glenda Spooner, For Love of Horses op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; She was advised there could be two hundred. Weeks passed before she found the first,&lt;ref&gt;Glenda Spooner,For Love of Horses op cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  but there were to be more than two hundred. In fact in the years from 1930 to 1934, she bought back 5,000 old army horses and mules.

==Campaign==
There were many challenges and obstacles throughout the early years of Brooke’s efforts. Progress was prolonged, and, as the wife of the senior cavalry officer in Egypt, she had strenuous social duties. Nevertheless, she acquired frail old horses when and where she found them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; She raised money from her friends and from her own pocket, got together a Committee, and set in motion the Old War Horse Campaign of Rescue.&lt;ref&gt;p. 222, Geoffrey Brooke, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1931, six months after her arrival in Egypt, she was writing to the Morning Post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dorothy Brooke's 1931 appeal|url=http://www.thebrooke.org/about-us/our-history/dorothy-brooke/dorothy-brookes-1931-appeal|website=Brooke Hospital for Animals|publisher=Brooke Hospital for Animals|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to appeal for funds. Thousands of readers responded. [[George V|King George V]] was one of her many supporters throughout the [[British Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 222, Geoffrey Brooke, op. cit.; Glenda Spooner, For Love of Horses op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, she used the premises of the Egyptian S.P.C.A., but this was to prove unrealistic in the long term, and it was difficult to find light, airy stables in Cairo – and to gain the necessary permission.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Glenda Spooner, For Love of Horses op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; However, she was persistent in working to raise money. During the first summer leave, she produced an 8-page pamphlet. There were further appeals in the press.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Almost all the old war horses were totally unfit to stand a voyage home. They were pathetically grateful for a drink and for somewhere to lie down.

“As their ill-shod misshapen hooves felt the deep tibbin [broken barley straw] bed beneath them, there would be another doubting disbelieving halt. Then gradually they would lower their heads and sniff as though they could not believe their own eyes or noses. Memories, long forgotten, would then return when some stepped eagerly forwards towards the mangers piled high with [[Trifolium alexandrinum|berseem]], while others, with creaking joints, lowered themselves slowly on to the bed and lay, necks and legs outstretched. There they remained, flat out, until hand fed by the syces.”&lt;ref&gt;quoting Dorothy Brooke, Glenda Spooner, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were given days of rest, and feed, and treated to kindness, and then put out of what was, for so many, their extreme misery. Very few were returned to England.

==Buying Committee==
Brooke had the services of a Buying Committee. It was composed largely of high-ranking British officers, where it is thought she the only woman. The Chairman was General Sir [[Charlton Spinks]], Sirdar of the Egyptian Army and fluent in Arabic. Other members included Major (later Brigadier) Roland Heveningham, R.A.V.C., who was to be first Veterinary Director of the Old War Horse Memorial Hospital, and Brigadier Geoffrey Brooke.&lt;ref&gt;Glenda Spooner, For Love of Horses op. cit.; p. 222, Geoffrey Brooke, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee was buying up to 60 or 70 animals every week, and scouts searched throughout Egypt. It was a grim task. Sometimes, one of the male committee members might be too anguished to remain at the table.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In the years 1930 to 1934, some 5,000 horses and old army [[mule]]s were found. They were identified by their conformation and army brands. The price paid represented the cost to the owner of a replacement.

On a Friday, ‘Black Friday’, the day after Buying Day – and for nine months of the year, every year for four years – Dorothy Brooke would select those to be destroyed, quietly and without alarm, by humane killer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Brooke never sought to blame the men and boys who through poverty and lack of knowledge, had failed their animals. The ‘tragic sight’ of the locally bred animals that appeared before the Buying Committee made her realise that a free hospital was needed – to which every poor owner could bring what might be his family’s sole earner, and obtain expert help and advice at the first signs of trouble instead of waiting hopelessly.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Brooke, For Love of Horses op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; She had set up a separate fund almost from the start. She called this The Animal Assistance Fund.

==Criticism==
Brooke attracted some criticism. Some of the British who were long familiar with Egypt felt that she was going too far in removing such a number of draught animals from a traditional economy. Others asserted that the Committee was buying frauds.&lt;ref&gt;Glenda Spooner, For love of Horses op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
At the end of four years, the war horse campaign could be closed. The Old War Horse Memorial Hospital was founded. Dorothy Brooke gained permission for the Hospital to place a drinking trough at the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids]]. The Cairo city authorities eventually adopted a policy of sanding the slippery stretches of street.

Geoffrey and Dorothy Brooke moved from Egypt to [[India]], where Geoffrey became Major-General of Cavalry. There Dorothy, besides giving her time and energy to the affairs of the Hospital, “threw herself into working to alleviate the suffering she saw all about her”. She managed to return to Cairo for an annual visit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Death==
The Brookes left India at the outbreak of [[World War II]]. After a gap – through precarious years for the Hospital – Dorothy Brooke was able to resume her trips to Egypt in 1946. In 1955, at their house in [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]], on the outskirts of Cairo, she was not well enough to travel back to Wiltshire. She is reported as having remarked to her husband, some weeks beforehand, “If I die – not that I am going to for ever so long – promise me you won’t go to my funeral service. I know it will only distress you and I shan’t be there myself.”&lt;ref&gt;p. 103, Glenda Spooner, For Love of Horses op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy Brooke died on 10 June 1955 and was buried in Cairo.&lt;ref name=the_brooke /&gt;

“Looking back on all she had accomplished,” remarks [[Glenda Spooner]], “one can feel certain that she thought little of her own share and a great deal of other people’s, for that was ever her way. She was indeed overwhelmed with gratitude to those who had made the rescue of the horses possible and it was no mean achievement.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

After his stepfather’s death in 1966, Major Philip Searight succeeded Geoffrey Brooke as Chairman. He guided the organisation through a period of expansion.&lt;ref&gt;obit. Philip Searight, www.telegraph.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Brooke’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren have maintained a tradition of service to The Brooke.&lt;ref name=the_brooke /&gt; Ann Searight, her granddaughter, served as a Trustee 1979-2011 and in 2014 is Honorary Vice-President.

Elizabeth Edmondson was born on 1 July 1950 in [[Perth, Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=perth-girl&gt;{{cite news|title=Gold Medals to Perth Girl|publisher=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]], [[Reuters]]|work=[[The Age]]|page=13|date=11 November 1964|location=Melbourne, Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 1951,&lt;ref name=Stinger&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westcoastswimclub.com.au/assets/stinger/2008/stinger_2008jun.pdf|accessdate=18 September 2011|title=My Story|first=Elizabeth|last=Edmondson|date=June 2008|work=The Stinger|publisher=West Coast Swim Club|format=PDF|location=Western Australia, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 15 months,&lt;ref name=perth-girl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stinger/&gt; she was diagnosed with [[Poliomyelitis|polio]].  She spent fifteen months in the hospital.  Her father made changes to the house to make it easier for her to get around, including the addition of parallel bars to help her learn to walk.  She started swimming when she was five years old,&lt;ref name=Stinger/&gt; at Crawley Baths in the Swan River.  The first strokes she learnt to swim were the backstroke, dog paddle and freestyle.&lt;ref name=newsletter-6&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hconc.org.au/publications/01%20Health%20Matters/Health%20Matters%20%20Issue%2081%20Pages%201-30.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2011|page=6|journal=Your Voice on Health|publisher=The Health Consumers‘ Council WA|issue=81|date=July–September 2010|title=The Jelly Bean Walk — My Story|last=Edmondson|first=Elizabeth|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; She learnt to swim without using her legs.&lt;ref name=newsletter-7&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hconc.org.au/publications/01%20Health%20Matters/Health%20Matters%20%20Issue%2081%20Pages%201-30.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2011|page=7|journal=Your Voice on Health|publisher=The Health Consumers‘ Council WA|issue=81|date=July–September 2010|title=The Jelly Bean Walk — My Story|last=Edmondson|first=Elizabeth|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; She first placed in a swimming competition during a competition in year one at school, where she finished third in a dog paddle swim.&lt;ref name=newsletter-7/&gt;

Her first [[orthotics|calliper]] did not allow her to bend her knee.&lt;ref name=Stinger/&gt; She was excited to receive her first calliper that allowed her knee to bend when she was ten years old. Edmondson had other issues with footwear as a youngster.  As her feet grew, she outgrew her custom-made footwear.  To extend the life of her shoes, the toes were cut out of them to provide more space for her own toes.&lt;ref name=newsletter-7/&gt;

When Edmonson was 14, her coach told her she had broken a world record while swimming at [[Beatty Park]] as a member of the Swimming Squad.&lt;ref name=newsletter-7/&gt; To qualify for the 1964 Summer Paralympics, she competed at the Third Australian Paraplegic Games held in Adelaide, South Australia.&lt;ref name=paragamesad&gt;{{cite book|title=Official programme, Third Australian Paraplegic Games, Adelaide, South Australia, September&amp;nbsp;10–12 1964|publisher=Royal Adelaide Hospital Paraplegic Unit|author1=The Paraplegic Association of South Australia|author2= The Paraplegic Sports Club of South Australia|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/33635960?q=%22paraplegic%22&amp;c=book}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the Australian Paraplegic Games in 1964, she broke a world record and a Commonwealth record.

Around the time that Elizabeth was starting to prepare for the Paralympics, she was a student at [[St Hilda's Anglican School for Girls]], a member of the West Perth Swimming Club, and an avid surfer.  Edmondson put her surfing on hold to spend more time training.&lt;ref name=girl-14/&gt;

Edmondson won a gold medal at the [[1968 Summer Paralympics]] in Tel Aviv in the 50 metre freestyle class 4 incomplete swimming event with a world record time of 0.44.1 and a gold medal in the 100 metre open freestyle swim event with a world record time of 1.33.0.

Edmondson competed with limited mobility in the water, during the Paralympics and the rest of her swimming career: She could only use her arms and shoulders to move through the water.

[[File:Lady Germain 1680 1769 Charles Philips.jpg|thumb|Lady Germain by [[C. E. S. Phillips|Charles Philips]]]]
'''Lady Elizabeth''' "'''Betty'''" '''Germain''' (1680 &amp;ndash; December 1769)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Grenville Papers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYhpAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA135|year=1852|pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a wealthy English aristocrat and courtier, a philanthropist and collector of antiquities, who corresponded with literary and political figures.

==Life==
Lady Elizabeth "Betty" Germain, ''née'' Berkeley, was second daughter of [[Charles Berkeley, 2nd Earl of Berkeley]] and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of [[Baptist Noel, 3rd Viscount Campden]]. In 1738, [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]] wrote of her that "notwithstanding the great pride of the [[Berkeley family]] she married an innkeeper's son," and maliciously adds in explanation that "she was very ugly, without a portion, and in her youth had an unlucky accident with one of her father's servants."&lt;ref name=DNB00&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Germain, Elizabeth|last=Courtney|first=William Prideaux|authorlink=William Prideaux Courtney|volume=21|quote=citing: [Suffolk Corresp.  i. 71-3, ii. 18-20, 43, 54-7, 159, 171-3, 213-15; Swift's Works (1884 ed.), xiv. 55-8, xvii. and xviii. passim, xix. 531; Pope's Letters, iii.

Lady Betty met Germain at the [[Hotwells|Hot Wells]], [[Bristol]], and they were shortly thereafter married in October 1706. He was a recent widower, having first married [[Mary Mordaunt|Mary Mordaunt, Baroness Mordaunt]], only child and heiress of the [[Henry Mordaunt, 2nd Earl of Peterborough|2nd Earl of Peterborough]], after her first husband, [[Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk]] had divorced her in 1700 over her love affair with Germain. Betty was thirty years younger than her husband, but her good sense made their union happy.

They had three children, two boys and a girl, all of whom died young, and in acknowledgment of her devotion in nursing them Germain left her the estate of Drayton in Northamptonshire, and the vast property which he had inherited from his first wife, who had died childless. On his deathbed, he expressed the wish that she would marry a young man and have children to succeed to her wealth, but hoped that otherwise her fortune might pass to a younger son of [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset]], who had married [[Elizabeth Sackville, Duchess of Dorset|Elizabeth]], daughter of Lieutenant-general Walter Philip Colyear, Germain's friend and colleague in the Dutch service. Though almost persuaded in later years to marry [[Lord Sidney Beauclerk]], a handsome and worthless fortune-hunter, she remained a widow for more than fifty years, and fulfilled her husband's wishes by leaving the estate of Drayton, with £20,000 in money and half the residue of her wealth, to the politician [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord George Sackville]], the Duke's second son, who in turn assumed the name of Germain.&lt;ref name="DNB00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

In 1730 she received a threatening anonymous letter left outside her London residence demanding £50 in return for her life. The Duke of Dorset showed the letter to the king, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] who ordered that Lady Betty was to have the protection of a file of musketeers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/GeorgianLords/status/1009413629580595200|title=The Georgian Lords on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lady Betty passed most of her widowhood in her own apartments at [[Knole House]], near [[Sevenoaks]] in west [[Kent]], the seat of her friends the Duke and Duchess of Dorset, or at her London town house in [[St. James's Square]] where she entertained politicians regardless of party or faction. She only occasionally visited [[Drayton House]], which she retained in much the condition her husband left it.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Anne Pimlott Baker, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10565  "Germain, Lady Elizabeth (Betty) (1680–1769)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009; accessed 4 Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Originally built in the 14th century and expanded over the centuries, Drayton had been lavishly remodelled in the early 18th century following Baroness Mordaunt's marriage to Germain. After her death, he continued to devote considerable attention to the estate, including his formal Dutch gardens, which Lady Betty maintained as they had been in his lifetime.&lt;ref name=VCH&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66294  'Parishes: Lowick'], ''A History of the County of Northampton: Volume 3'' (1930), pp. 231-243. Accessed 4 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

She died at her town house on 16 December 1769. Her elder sister married Thomas Chamber of Ilanworth, Middlesex, and had two daughters, who, as their parents died young, were brought up entirely under Lady Betty's guardianship. The elder niece, Mary, married [[Vere Beauclerk, 1st Baron Vere]]. The younger, Anne, became the wife of [[Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple]], a close political associate of his brother-in-law, [[William Pitt the Elder|William Pitt (the Elder), 1st Earl of Chatham]]. Most of the balance of Lady Betty's estate was left to Lady Vere,&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; and the disposition of her money is set out in a letter from Vere to Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Grenville Papers, iv. 490-3&lt;/ref&gt; She left £120,000 in the funds.&lt;ref name="DNB00"/&gt;

==Influence==
[[Horace Walpole]] paid a visit to Drayton in 1763, and found the house "covered with portraits, crammed with old china". Many of her curiosities were sold after her death, by auction. The [[cameo (carving)|cameos]] and [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglios]] collected by [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel]], were bequeathed to Germain by his first wife. Lady Betty offered the collection to the [[British Museum]] for £10,000, and, as the offer was declined, gave them in 1762 to her great-niece, Lady Mary Beauclerk, who married [[Lord Charles Spencer]], son of the [[3rd Duke of Marlborough]]. These gems were described in two folio volumes entitled ''Gemmarum antiquarum delectus quse in dactyliothecis Ducis Marlburiensis conservantur'', 1781–90; the engravings were chiefly by Bartolozzi, and the Latin text by [[Jacob Bryant]] and William Cole (1753–1806)&lt;!-- Notable --&gt;. The gems were part of the Marlborough collection sold in 1875 for £36,750.&lt;ref name="DNB00"/&gt;

She is acknowledged to have "outlived the irregularities of her youth, and she was esteemed for her kindness and liberality." She gave £500 to the [[Foundling Hospital]] in 1746. Her politics were indicated by a present of £100 to [[John Wilkes]] during his imprisonment.&lt;ref name="DNB00"/&gt;

[[Jonathan Swift]] was chaplain to her father from 1699 to 1701, while the Earl of Berkeley was lord justice in Ireland, and Lady Betty and Swift continued their friendship during the various times he spent in England. She added a stanza to the dean's ballad on the game of traffic, written at [[Dublin Castle]] in 1699, which produced from him in August 1702 a second ballad "to the tune of the Cutpurse."&lt;ref name="DNB00"/&gt; Her name is often mentioned in the ''[[Journal to Stella]]'', and as a vocal [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]], she often disputed with the dean on political topics. Many letters to and from her are included in Swift's ''Works'' and in the ''Suffolk Correspondence''.&lt;ref name=Suffolk&gt;''Letters to and from Henrietta, Countess of Suffolk, and her second husband, the Hon. George Berkeley''; from 1712 to 1767, with historical, biographical, and explanatory notes (London: J Murray) 1824, in 2 volumes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=NK8Zs_Yt6T8C  Vol. 1] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=mnIRAAAAYAAJ  Vol. 2]. Accessed 4 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Her spirited letter to Swift defending her friend [[Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk]] ([[George II of Great Britain|George II's]] mistress and Betty's future sister-in-law) against Swift's harsh censure is especially singled out as doing her "great honour". Though their correspondence appears to have ceased in 1737, she retained him in her affections, and a portrait of Swift still hangs in her rooms at Knole.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;  [[Edward Young]] dedicated to Lady Betty his sixth satire on women, and according to a correspondent in [[John Nichols (printer)|Nichols's]] ''Literary Anecdotes'',&lt;ref&gt;Vol ii. 11&lt;/ref&gt; she was credited with having written a satire on [[Alexander Pope]].&lt;ref name="DNB00"/&gt; The manuscripts at Drayton, which include communications to and from Lady Betty, are described in the [[Historical Manuscripts Commission]]'s report on the MSS of Mrs Stopford Sackville of Drayton House.&lt;ref name="HMC"&gt;Ninth report, Part 3, of the Historical Manuscripts Commission (1884) [MSS of Mrs Stopford Sackville of Drayton House, Northamptonshire], expanded and reprinted in two volumes, [https://archive.org/details/cu31924091753990  Vol. 1] (1904) and [https://archive.org/details/cu31924091754006  Vol. 2] (principally American matters, 1910).&lt;/ref&gt;

A brass plaque commemorating her is found at [[St Peter's Church, Lowick]], near to Sir John Germain's tomb.&lt;ref name="Lowick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowickchurch.com/history.html|title=History|year=2009|work=Lowick Church - St Peter's Church, Lowick, Northamptonshire|publisher=Lowick Parochial Church Council|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eroseanna “Sis” Robinson was an American social worker, track star, activist and member of the [[Peacemakers]] who organized for [[desegregation]] and against the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Riegle, Rosalie. Crossing the Line. Eugene, OR: Cascade Books, 2013, p.32; “Trio Ends Hunger Strike in Eatery Bias Case.” Jet Magazine, 12 Oct, 1961; “Tax Protest Turns to Jail Hunger Strike.” The Chicago Tribune, Jan. 29 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, she was an advocate of [[nonviolent resistance]] strategies. Robinson went on hunger strike or risked violence and arrest multiple times, but nonetheless won various victories for equality. Born in 1924, Robinson died at age in 52 in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;“Eroseanna Robinson.” The War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee Website, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her activism, Robinson was a successful track runner. These two interests collided when she was chosen to represent the [[United States]] in a track meet against [[Russia]] and refused to participate because she felt she was being used as a “political pawn” by appearing alongside white athletes, giving the international community the false impression that white and black people were treated equally inside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edmund. Cold War and the Income Tax: A Protest. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1963, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==

=== Integration of Skateland ===
In 1952, Eroseanna Robinson worked at a community center in [[Cleveland]] when she decided that she would help to desegregate a public skating facility called Skateland. In trying to accomplish this goal, she pursued a non-violent plan. In her first attempt to desegregate Skateland, she brought children—two black children and one white child—from the community center at which she worked to skate. White teenagers harassed the children. Over the next few days, Robinson returned with friends who supported her cause but was continually tripped and physically assaulted by white customers at Skateland. At one point, Robinson required urgent medical attention after she was shoved, causing her to break an arm. Skateland’s management and security teams did not intervene on Robinson’s behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Wolcott, Victoria W., Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters: The Struggle Over Segregated Recreation in America. Philadelphia, 2012, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War Tax Resistance ===
In early 1960, Robinson held another nonviolent protest by refusing to pay federal taxes as a way of showing her lack of support for the United States military. Her refusal to pay taxes caused her to be sentenced to a year of imprisonment, but she used the process as an opportunity to engage in nonviolent protest. When she was sentenced, Robinson has to be carried into the courtroom on a stretcher because she refused to walk. Once she was in prison, she held a three-month fast. She was force fed through a tube and then released nine months before her sentence was complete.&lt;ref&gt;Updegrove, R.L. "Refusing to Be the Other: Barbara Deming's Experiments with Nonviolence." Diss. Northern Arizona U, 2014, Print. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restaurant Integration ===
In 1961, Eroseanna Robinson travelled along [[Route 40 (MTA Maryland)|Route 40]] in Maryland with [[Wally Nelson|Wally]] and [[Juanita Morrow Nelson|Juanita Nelson]]. The three decided to stop for dinner in [[Elkton, Maryland]], but a diner refused to serve them. The trio refused to leave until police came and arrested them, putting them in county jail. In jail, they refused to appear in court or eat. Their story was picked up by local newspapers which dubbed them the “Elkton Three.” Since the trio refused to cooperate with the court proceedings, they were given $50 fines and released. Their case sparked a local movement for desegregation that ended up gaining then Maryland Governor [[J. Millard Tawes|Millar Tawes]]’ attention and led to eventual desegregation of restaurants along Route 40.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 204-210.”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Although not widely known amongst other African American civil rights activists, Robinson was instrumental in integrating several public spaces across the country in the early days of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. She is perhaps most remembered for her methods of nonviolent resistance, which were deployed in sit-ins and other pro-integration demonstrations throughout the latter part of the Civil Rights Movement.

Her work to integrate restaurants along Maryland’s Route 40 had international ramifications, as foreign diplomats would often travel the road in trips from [[Washington, D.C.]]. to [[New York City]]. In 1958, Kenyan politician [[Komla Agbeli Gbedemah|Komla Gbedema]] was denied service at a restaurant on Route 40, which embarrassed the [[Eisenhower]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 204.”&lt;/ref&gt; With the slogan “49 Miles of Highway and No Place to Stop and Eat,” Robinson, the Nelsons, and others were able to integrate these Maryland restaurants, which at the time hurt the United State’s international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 207-208.”&lt;/ref&gt; During several of Robinson’s [[hunger strike]]s, she also garnered headlines in African American publications, who lauded her relentless commitment to achieve racial justice.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 207-208.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson stands as an icon of the war tax resistance movement. The [[National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee]], a grassroots movement with the aim of educating American taxpayers of their rights to resist making tax contributions to war efforts, touts Robinson as a foundational figure in their movement.

Social work, as a profession, has a history of leadership within social justice movements that dates back to the work of activists like Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;Tricia B. Bent-Goodley; A Call for Social Work Activism. Soc Work 2015; 60 (2): 101-103. doi: 10.1093/sw/swv005, pg. 101.”&lt;/ref&gt; Today, social workers carry on this legacy of activism through grassroots movements such as RISE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diaz|first1=Fernanda|title=The New Generation of Activists: How Social Workers from RISE are Restoring Social Justice to their Profession|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fernanda-diaz/the-new-generation-of-act_b_781496.html|accessdate=13 April 2017|work=[[HuffPost]]|publisher=Oath Inc.|date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A photograph taken four minutes after her death by photography student Robert Wiles has become an iconic [[suicide]] photograph, referred to as "the most beautiful suicide".&lt;ref name="time_'The"&gt;{{Cite web |title='The Most Beautiful Suicide': A Violent Death, an Immortal Photo |author=Ben Cosgrove |work=TIME.com |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |url=http://time.com/3456028/the-most-beautiful-suicide-a-violent-death-an-immortal-photo/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyti_Cras"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Crashing to Earth, Again and Again |author=Page, Max |work=New York Times |date=April 23, 2006 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/nyregion/thecity/23scar.html?_r=1&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Evelyn McHale was born in [[Berkeley, California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/evelyn_f_mchale_born_1923_797875 |work=[[California Birth Index]] |title=The Birth of Evelyn Mchale |accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of nine children to Helen and Vincent McHale. Vincent was a [[bank examiner]] and relocated to [[Washington D.C.]] in 1930. Her mother suffered from undiagnosed and untreated depression, this led to a challenging marriage, and ultimately a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evelyn Mchale |url=http://www.codex99.com/photography/43.html |website=Codex99 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent gained custody of all children and moved to [[Tuckahoe (village), New York|Tuckahoe, New York.]]

After graduating from high school Evelyn joined the [[Women's Army Corps]], and was stationed in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]].

She later moved to [[Baldwin, Nassau County, New York|Baldwin, New York]] and was employed as a bookkeeper at the Kitab Engraving Company on [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]]. She met her fiance Barry Rhodes, a college student discharged from the United States Army Air Force.&lt;ref name="rare_TheM"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Most Beautiful Suicide: Evelyn McHale Leapt to Her Death from the Empire State Building, 1947 |author=Robert C.

===Death===
On April 30, 1947, McHale took a train from New York to [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] to visit Rhodes. The next day, after leaving Rhodes' residence, she returned to New York City and went to the Empire State Building where she jumped from the 86th floor observatory. A security guard was reportedly standing approximately ten feet from her just before she jumped.

Rhodes did not notice any indication of suicide before McHale left. Detective Frank Murray found her [[suicide note]] in a black pocketbook next to her neatly folded cloth coat over the observation deck wall which read:&lt;ref name="rare_TheM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="real_TheW"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Wild and Dark History of the Empire State Building, One of New York City's Most Recognized Landmarks, and Known for its Record-Breaking Height |last=Reporter |first=Staff |work=Realty Today |date=November 27, 2015 |accessdate=April 17, 2016 |url=http://www.realtytoday.com/articles/56503/20151127/wild-dark-history-empire-state-building-one-new-york-city.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her body was identified by her sister, Helen Brenner.

In accordance with her wishes, she was cremated with no memorial, service or grave.&lt;ref name="rare_TheM"/&gt;

Her then-fiance, Barry became an engineer before moving South, he died in Melbourne, Florida on October 9th 2007, unmarried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evelyn Mchale |url=http://www.codex99.com/photography/43.html |website=Codex99 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Evelyn McHale.jpg|thumb|The Robert Wiles photo]]

The photo of her body, taken by Robert Wiles, has been compared to the photograph by [[Malcolm Wilde Browne]] of the [[self-immolation]] of Vietnamese Buddhist monk [[Thích Quảng Đức]] who burned himself alive at a busy Saigon road intersection on June 11, 1963, which is widely regarded as among the most iconic suicide photographs. Ben Cosgrove of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the photo as "technically rich, visually compelling and ... downright beautiful". Cosgrove described her body as "resting, or napping, rather than ... dead" and appears as if she is "daydreaming of her beau".&lt;ref name="time_'The"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gawk_Spec"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Specter Detector: Courting the Empire State Building's Prettiest Ghost |last=Conaboy |first=Kelly |work=[[Gawker]] |date=September 25, 2015 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |url=http://gawker.com/specter-detector-courting-the-empire-state-buildings-p-1732169081 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425222325/http://gawker.com/specter-detector-courting-the-empire-state-buildings-p-1732169081 |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her picture was also used on the cover of [[Saccharine Trust]]'s album ''[[Surviving You, Always]]'', released in 1984 by [[SST Records]].

[[David Bowie]]'s 1993 video for the single "[[Jump They Say]]" includes a recreation of the image, with the singer splayed atop a smashed car.

The cover of the 1995 album ''[[Gilt (album)|Gilt]]'' by the Tucson band [[Machines of Loving Grace]] uses a color photo that recreates the original image.

The shot is also referenced at the start of Taylor Swift's 'Bad Blood' video.

{{commons|Plumed serpent}}
The '''Feathered Serpent''' was a prominent supernatural entity or deity, found in many [[Mesoamerica]]n religions.  It was called [[Quetzalcoatl]] among the [[Aztec Mythology|Aztec]]s, [[Kukulkan]] among the [[Maya mythology|Yucatec Maya]], and [[Q'uq'umatz]] and [[Tohil]]  among the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]]. The double symbolism used in its name is considered allegoric to the dual nature of the deity, where being feathered represents its divine nature or ability to fly to reach the skies and being a serpent represents its human nature or ability to creep on the ground among other animals of the Earth, a dualism very common in Mesoamerican deities.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest representations of feathered serpents appear in the [[Olmec]] culture ([[circa]] 1400-400 [[Common Era|BCE]]).&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 1.  Other authors give a slightly different dates.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most surviving representations in Olmec art, such as [[:File:La Venta Stele 19 (Delange).jpg|Monument 19]] at [[La Venta]] and a painting in the [[Juxtlahuaca]] cave (see below), show it as a [[Crest (feathers)|crested]] [[rattlesnake]], sometimes with feathers covering the body and legs, and often in close proximity to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Joralemon, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that Olmec supernatural entities such as the feathered serpent were the forerunners of many later Mesoamerican deities,&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, p. 62.  Joralemon, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; although experts disagree on the feathered serpent's importance to the Olmec.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 104 says that "its rarity suggests that it was a minor member of the Olmec pantheon".  Joralemon (1996) however, states that "the feathered serpent is a divinity of considerable importance in Olmec civilization", p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pantheon of the people of [[Teotihuacan]] (200 BCE – 700 CE) also featured a feathered serpent, shown most prominently on the [[Temple of the Feathered Serpent, Teotihuacan|Temple of the Feathered Serpent]] (dated 150–200 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Castro.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several feathered serpent representations appear on the building, including full-body profiles and feathered serpent heads.

Buildings in [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]], the capital of the later [[Toltec]]s (950–1150 CE), also featured profiles of feathered serpents.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aztec feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl is known from several [[Aztec codices]] such as the [[Florentine codex]], as well as from the records of the Spanish [[conquistador]]s.  Quetzalcoatl was a bringer of knowledge, the inventor of books, and associated with the planet [[Venus]].

The corresponding Mayan god Kukulkan was rare in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic era]] [[Maya civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the [[Popol Vuh]], the K'iche' feathered serpent god [[Tepeu]] [[Q'uq'umatz]] is the creator of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the feathered serpent deity, several other serpent gods existed in the pantheon of Mesoamerican gods with similar traits.

'''Galicians''' ({{lang-gl|galegos}}, {{lang-es|gallegos}}) are a [[nation]]al, cultural and [[ethnic group]] whose historic homeland is [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], in the north-west of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Recalde|first=Montserrat|title=La vitalidad etnolingüística gallega|year=1997|publisher=Centro de Estudios sobre Comunicación Interlingüistíca e Intercultural|location=València|isbn=9788437028958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Romance languages are widely spoken and official in Galicia: the native [[Galician language|Galician]] and, mainly because of [[language shift]], [[Castilian language|Castilian]].&lt;ref name="Use of Galician language 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ige.eu/estatico/html/gl/sociais/benestar/cvida/2003/modulo_especifico/T02_014.htm|title=Persoas segundo a lingua na que falan habitualmente. Ano 2003|website=Ige.eu|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology of the ethnonym==
[[File:Selection_of_carvings_from_the_Castro_de_Santa_Trega.jpg|thumb|left|[[Castro culture]] carved stones]]
The [[ethnonym]] Galicians (''Galegos'') derives from the Latin ''[[Gallaeci]]'' or ''Callaeci'', itself an adaptation of the name of a local Celtic tribe known to the Greeks as Καλλαϊκoί (''Kallaikoí''), who lived in what is now northern [[Portugal]] and who were conquered by the Roman General [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus]] in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name='Moralejo'&gt;{{cite book|last=Moralejo|first=Juan J.|title=Callaica nomina : estudios de onomástica gallega|year=2008|publisher=Fundación Pedro Barrié de la Maza|location=A Coruña|isbn=978-84-95892-68-3|pages=113–148|url=http://ilg.usc.es/agon/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Callaica_Nomina.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans later applied this name to all the people who shared the same [[Castro culture|culture]] and [[Gallaecian language|language]] in the northwest, from the [[Douro river|Douro River valley]] in the south to the [[Cantabrian Sea]] in the north and west to the [[Navia (river)|Navia River]], encompassing tribes as the [[Celtici]], the [[Artabri]], the [[Lemavi]] and the [[Albiones]], among others.

The etymology of the name has been studied since the 7th century by authors such as [[Isidore of Seville]], who wrote that "Galicians are called so because of their fair skin, as the Gauls", relating the name to the Greek word for milk. However, modern scholars &lt;ref name='Moralejo' /&gt; have derived the name of the ancient ''Callaeci'' either from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *''kal-n-eH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' 'hill', through a local relational [[suffix]] ''-aik-'', so meaning 'the highlanders'; or either from [[Proto-Celtic]] *''kallī''- 'forest', so meaning 'the forest (people)'.&lt;ref&gt;Curchin, Leonard A. (2008) [http://estudiosgallegos.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosgallegos/article/view/41 Estudios Gallegos''The toponyms of the Roman Galicia: New Study'']. CUADERNOS DE ESTUDIOS GALLEGOS '''LV''' (121): 111.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most recent proposal comes from linguist [[Francesco Benozzo]] after identifying the root ''gall-'' / ''kall-'' in a number of Celtic words with the meaning "stone" or "rock", as follows: ''gall'' (old Irish), ''gal'' (Middle Welsh), ''gailleichan'' (Scottish Gaelic), ''kailhoù'' (Breton), ''galagh'' (Manx) and ''gall'' (Gaulish). Hence, Benozzo explains the name ''Callaecia'' and its ethnonym ''Callaeci''  as being "the stone people" or "the people of the stone" ("those who work with stones"), in reference to the ancient [[megalith|megaliths]] and stone formations so common in Galicia.&lt;ref&gt;Benozzo, F. (2018) ''Uma paisagem atlântica pré-histórica. Etnogénese e etno-filologia paleo-mesolítica das tradições galega e portuguesa'', in proceedings of Jornadas das Letras Galego-Portuguesas 2015-2017, DTS, Università di Bologna and Academia Galega da Língua Portuguesa, pp. 159-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==

===Galician===
{{Main|Galician language}}

[[File:Percentage of Galician speakers (corrected).PNG|thumb|250px|A map of Galicia showing speakers of Galician as first language in 2001, Galician Institute of Statistics.]]
'''Galician''' is a [[Romance language]] belonging to the Western Ibero-Romance branch; as such, it derives from [[Latin]]. It has official status in [[Galicia (Iberian Peninsula)|Galicia]]. Galician is also spoken in the neighbouring autonomous communities of [[Asturias]] and [[Castile and León]], near theirs borders with Galicia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=glg|title=Galician|work=Ethnologue|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval or Old Galician, also known by linguists as [[Galician-Portuguese]], developed locally in the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula from [[Vulgar Latin]], becoming the language spoken and written in the medieval kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] (from 1230 united with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Leon|Leon]] and [[Kingdom of Castille|Castille]] under the same sovereign) and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. The Galician-Portuguese language developed a rich [[Galician-Portuguese lyric|literary tradition]] from the last years of the 12th century. During the 13th century it gradually substituted Latin as the language used in public and private charters, deeds, and legal documents, in Galicia, Portugal, and in the neighbouring regions in Asturias and Leon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Azevedo Maia|first=Clarinda|title=História do Galego-Português. Estado linguistico da Galiza e do Noroeste de Portugal desde o século XIII ao século XVI|year=1986|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Investigação Científica|location=Coimbra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galician-Portuguese diverged into two linguistic varieties - Galician and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] - from the 15th century on. Galician became a regional variety open to the influence of [[Castilian Spanish]], while Portuguese became the international one, as language of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. The two varieties are still close together, and in particular northern Portuguese dialects share an important number of similarities with Galician ones.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The official institution regulating the Galician language, backed by the Galician government and universities, the Royal Galician Academy, claims that modern Galician must be considered an independent Romance language belonging to the group of Ibero-Romance languages and having strong ties with Portuguese and its northern dialects.

However, the ''[[Galician Language Association|Associaçom Galega da Língua]]'' (Galician Language Association) and ''[[Galician Academy of the Portuguese Language|Academia Galega da Língua Portuguesa]]'' (Galician Academy of the Portuguese Language), belonging to the [[reintegrationist|Reintegrationist]] movement, support the idea that differences between Galician and Portuguese speech are not enough to justify considering them as separate languages: Galician is simply one variety of Galician-Portuguese, along with Brazilian Portuguese, African Portuguese, the Galician-Portuguese still spoken in Spanish Extremadura, (''Fala''), and other variations.
 
Nowadays, despite the positive effects of official recognition of the Galician language, Galicia's socio-linguistic development has experienced the growing influence of Spanish due the media as well as legal imposition of Spanish in learning.

Galicia also boasts a rich oral tradition, in the form of songs, tales, and sayings, which has made a vital contribution to the spread and development of the Galician language. Still flourishing today, this tradition shares much with that of Portugal.

===Castilianization===
{{Main|Castilianization}} 
Many Galician surnames have become [[Castilianization|Castilianized]] over the centuries, most notably after the forced submission of the Galician nobility obtained by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] in the last years of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mariño Paz|first=Ramón|title=Historia da lingua galega|year=1998|publisher=Sotelo Blanco|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=847824333X|pages=195–205|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflected the gradual spread of [[Spanish language]], through the cities, in [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[Lugo]], [[A Coruña]],  [[Vigo]] and [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]], in the last case due to the establishment of an important base of the [[Spanish navy]] there in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mariño Paz|first=Ramón|title=Historia da lingua galega|year=1998|publisher=Sotelo Blanco|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=847824333X|pages=225–230|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, surnames like ''Orxás'', ''Veiga'', ''Outeiro'', became ''Orjales'', ''Vega'', ''Otero''. Toponyms like ''[[Ourense]]'', ''[[A Coruña]]'', ''[[Fisterra]]'' became ''Orense'', ''La Coruña'', ''Finisterre''. In many cases this linguistic assimilation created confusion, for example ''Niño da Aguia'' (Galician: ''Eagle's Nest'') was translated into Spanish as ''Niño de la Guía'' (Spanish: the Guide's child) and ''Mesón do Bento'' (Galician: ''Benedict's house'') was translated as ''Mesón del Viento'' (Spanish: House of Wind).

===Ancient peoples of Galicia===
{{See also|Gallaeci|Gallaecia|Kingdom of Galicia}}
In pre-historic times Galicia was one of the primary foci of [[Atlantic Europe|Atlantic European]] [[Megalithic Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Benozzo, F. (2018): "Uma paisagem atlântica pré-histórica. Etnogénese e etno-filologia paleo-mesolítica das tradições galega e portuguesa", in proceedings of Jornadas das Letras Galego-Portugesas 2015-2017. Università de Bologna, DTS and Academia Galega da Língua Portuguesa. pp. 159-170&lt;/ref&gt; Following on that, the gradual emergence of a [[Celts|Celtic culture]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://milesio.wordpress.com/2016/03/23/a-galiza-e-o-norte-de-portugal-sao-a-origem-da-celticidade-europeia-f-benozzo/ Galicia and North Portugal are the origin of European celticity], interview with Prof. Francesco Benozzo, 13/03/2016&lt;/ref&gt; gave way to a well established material Celtic civilization known as the [[Castro Culture]]. Galicia suffered a relatively late and weak [[Ancient Rome|Romanisation]], although it was after this event when [[Latin language|Latin]], which is considered to be the main root of modern Galician, eventually replaced the old [[Gallaecian language]].

The decline of the Roman Empire was followed by the rule of Germanic tribes, namely the [[Suebi]], who formed a [[Kingdom of the Suebi|separate Galician kingdom]] in 409, and the [[Visigothic|Visigoths]]. In 718 the area briefly came under the control of the Moors after their conquest and dismantling of the Visigothic Empire, but the Galicians successfully rebelled against Moorish rule in 739, establishing a renewed [[Kingdom of Galicia]] which would become totally stable after 813 with the medieval popularization of the [[Camino de Santiago|"Way of St James"]].

===Political and administrative divisions===
The autonomous community (a concept established in the [[Spanish constitution]] of 1978) that is known as ''(a) Comunidade Autónoma Galega'' in Galician, and as ''(la) Comunidad Autónoma Gallega'' in Spanish (in English: ''Galician Autonomous Community''), is composed of the four Spanish provinces of [[Province of A Coruña|A Coruña]], [[Province of Lugo|Lugo]], [[Province of Ourense|Ourense]], and [[Province of Pontevedra|Pontevedra]].

The official languages are Galician and Spanish. Knowledge of Spanish is compulsory according to the Spanish constitution and virtually universal. Knowledge of Galician, after declining for many years owing to the pressure of Spanish and official persecution, is again on the rise due to favorable official language policies and popular support. Currently about 82% of Galicia's population can speak Galician&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ige.eu/estatico/html/gl/sociais/benestar/cvida/2003/modulo_especifico/T01_002.htm|title=Persoas segundo o grao de entendemento do galego falado.

=== Celtic revival and Celtic identity ===
{{See also|Castro culture|Gallaecian language|Celtic place names in Galicia|List of Galician words of Celtic origin}}
In the 19th century a group of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Nationalism|Nationalist]] writers and scholars, among them [[Eduardo Pondal]] and [[Manuel Murguía]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=González García|first=F. J. (coord.)|title=Los pueblos de la Galicia céltica|date=2007|publisher=[[Ediciones Akal]]|location=Madrid|isbn=9788446022602|pages=19–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; led a "Celtic revival" initially based on the historical testimonies of ancient Roman and Greek authors ([[Pomponius Mela]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Strabo]] and [[Ptolemy]]), who wrote about the Celtic peoples who inhabited Galicia; but they also based this revival in [[List of Galician words of Celtic origin|linguistic]] and [[Celtic place names in Galicia|onomastic]] data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=editor|first=John T.

During the late 19th and early 20th century this revival permeated Galician society: in 1916 ''[[Os Pinos]]'', a poem by Eduardo Pondal, was chosen as the lyrics for the new Galician hymn. One of the strophes of the poem says: ''Galicians, be strong / ready to great deeds / align your breast / for a glorious end / sons of the noble Celts / strong and traveler / fight for the fate / of the homeland of [[Breogán]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Galegos, sede fortes / prontos a grandes feitos / aparellade os peitos / a glorioso afán / fillos dos nobres celtas / fortes e peregrinos / luitade plos destinos / dos eidos de Breogán" Cf. {{cite web|title=Himno Gallego|url=http://www.himnogallego.com/ospinos_galego.htm|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Celtic past became an integral part of the self-perceived Galician identity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=González García|first=F.

(coord.)|title=Los pueblos de la Galicia céltica|date=2007|publisher=[[Ediciones Akal]]|location=Madrid|isbn=9788446022602|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result an important number of cultural association and sport clubs received names related to the Celts, among them [[Celta de Vigo]], [[Céltiga FC]], or [[A Coruña Fillos de Breogán|Fillos de Breogán]]. From the 1970s a series of Celtic music and cultural festivals were also popularized, being the most notable the ''Festival Internacional do Mundo Celta de [[Ortigueira]]'', at the same time that Galician folk musical bands and interpreters became usual participants in Celtic festivals elsewhere, as in the Interceltic festival of Lorient, where Galicia sent its first delegation already in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cabon|first=Alain|title=Le Festival Interceltique de Lorient : quarante ans au coeur du monde celte|date=2010|publisher=Éditions Ouest-France|location=Rennes|isbn=978-2-7373-5223-2|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anne Louise Germaine de Staël-Holstein''' ({{IPA-fr|stal|lang}}; née '''Necker'''; 22 April 1766{{snd}}14 July 1817), commonly known as '''Madame de Staël''', was a French woman of letters of [[Republic of Geneva|Genevan]] origin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F16051.php Staël, Germaine de], in the [[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]].&lt;/ref&gt; whose lifetime overlapped with the events of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic era]]. For many years she lived as an exile under the [[Reign of Terror]] and under Napoleonic persecution. Known as a witty and brilliant conversationalist, often dressed in flashy and revealing outfits, she participated actively in the political and intellectual life of her times. She was present at the first opening of the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] and at the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].&lt;ref name="bordoni2005"&gt;[https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/z-oldsites/crlc/documents/byronessays/lordbyronandgermainedestael.pdf Lord Byron and Germaine de Staël by Silvia Bordoni, The University of Nottingham 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Her intellectual collaboration with [[Benjamin Constant]] between 1795 and 1811 made them one of the most celebrated intellectual couples of their time. They discovered sooner than others the tyrannical character and designs of Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=6NE-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Last+View+on+Politics+and+Finance+Necker#v=onepage&amp;q=Last%20View%20on%20Politics%20and%20Finance%20Necker&amp;f=false Considerations on the Principal Events of the French Revolution ..., Band 2 by Madame de Staël, p. 46]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814 one of her contemporaries observed that "there are three great powers struggling against Napoleon for the soul of Europe: England, Russia, and Madame de Staël".&lt;ref&gt;''Mémoires de Madame de Chastenay, 1771–1815''&lt;/ref&gt; Her works, both novels and [[travel literature]], with emphasis on passion, individuality and oppositional politics made their mark on European [[Romanticism]]. 

==Childhood==
[[File:Carmontelle - Germaine Necker.JPG|thumb|left|Germaine Necker by [[Carmontelle]]]]

Germaine (or ''Minette'') was the only child of the prominent Genevan banker and statesman [[Jacques Necker]], who was the [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Director-General of Finance]] under King [[Louis XVI of France]]. Her mother was [[Suzanne Curchod]], also of Swiss birth, who hosted in [[Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin]] one of the most popular [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]s of Paris.{{sfn|Saintsbury|1911|p=750}} Mme Necker wanted to educate her daughter according to the principles of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and to endow her with the intellectual education and [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] discipline instilled in her by her pastor father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWLHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=germaine+de+stael+was+calvinist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vSsNI15JjE&amp;sig=3idg70qTcoQ1IJIgxThShIQPWkQ&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM4N6amt7SAhXJjpAKHbb-AesQ6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=germaine+de+stael+was+calvinist&amp;f=false|title=The Empire of Stereotypes: Germaine de Staël and the Idea of Italy|first=R.|last=Casillo|date=13 May 2006|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday she habitually brought Germaine as a young child to sit at her feet in her salon, where the guests took pleasure in stimulating the brilliant child.&lt;ref&gt;Celebrities such as the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]], [[Jean-François Marmontel]], [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Melchior Grimm]], [[Edward Gibbon]], the [[Abbé Raynal]], [[Jean-François de la Harpe]], [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]], [[Denis Diderot]], and [[Jean d'Alembert]] were frequent visitors.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of thirteen, she read Montesquieu, Shakespeare, Rousseau and Dante.&lt;ref name="swisscastles1"&gt;http://www.swisscastles.ch/Vaud/chateau/jouxtens.html&lt;/ref&gt; This exposure occasioned a nervous breakdown in adolescence, but the seeds of a literary vocation had been sown.

Her father "... is remembered today for taking the unprecedented step in 1781 of making public the country’s budget, a novelty in an [[absolute monarchy]] where the state of finances had always been kept a secret."&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/stael-and-the-french-revolution Stael and the French Revolution Introduction by Aurelian Craiutu]&lt;/ref&gt; Leading to his dismissal in May, the family eventually took up residence in 1784 at [[Coppet Castle|Château Coppet]], an estate her father purchased on [[Lake Geneva]]. The family returned to the Paris region in 1785, and Mlle Necker continued to write miscellaneous works, including the three-act romantic drama ''Sophie'' (1786) and the five-act tragedy, ''Jeanne Grey'' (1787).

==Marriage==
[[File:Paris Hôtel de Salm-Dyck 42.JPG|thumb|The Swedish Embassy, Hôtel de Ségur, later Hôtel de Salm-Dyck]]

At the age of eleven, Germaine proposed to marry [[Edward Gibbon]], who was fancied by her mother. Then he would always be around for her.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Maria Child (1836) The biography of Madame de Stael, p. 6.[https://books.google.nl/books?id=9eoKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=Robespierre+Commune+1792+september+Stael&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V58n3gl9fU&amp;sig=muJbLdKDkTAQ5steR4KGh5adpFM&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiI2qGX7IXdAhUM6KQKHUlIAoAQ6AEwBXoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Robespierre%20Commune%201792%20september%20Stael&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1783, she was courted by [[William Pitt the Younger]] and by the [[fop]] [[Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert|Comte de Guibert]], whose conversation, she thought, was the most far-ranging, spirited and fertile she had ever known.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schama (1990) Citizens, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; When she did not accept their offers Germaine's parents became impatient. Finally, a marriage was arranged with Baron [[Erik Magnus Staël von Holstein]], an attaché of the [[Embassy of Sweden, Paris|Swedish legation to France]]&lt;!--, and then minister after 1783 {{citation needed}} For a great heiress possessed of great ambition, the marriage did not seem brilliant, but Germaine had wealth and her future husband had considerable political and social standing.--&gt;. It took place on 14 January 1786 in the Swedish embassy at 97, [[Rue du Bac]]; Germaine was 20, her husband 37. On the whole, the marriage seems to have been acceptable to both parties, although neither seems to have had any or little affection for the other. The baron, a gambler, obtained great benefits as he received 80,000 [[French livre|pounds]] and was confirmed as lifetime ambassador to Paris, although his wife was almost certainly the more effective envoy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/13/biography.features Napoleon's nemesis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolutionary activities==
[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|right|On 4 and 5 May 1789 Germaine joined the meetings of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] in Versailles, where she met with the young [[Mathieu de Montmorency]].]]

In 1788, she published ''Letters on the works and character of J.J. Rousseau''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LgUaAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA353&amp;ots=pAAgEEGbBc&amp;dq=melchior%20Grimm%201789&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA353#v=onepage&amp;q=melchior%20Grimm%201789&amp;f=false ''Historical &amp; literary memoirs and anecdotes by Friedrich Melchior Grimm and Denis Diderot'', H. Colburn, 1815, p. 353.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this fervid [[panegyric]], at first written for a limited number of friends (in which she accused his housekeeper [[Thérèse Levasseur]] of having been unfaithful), she demonstrated evident talent, but little in the way of critical discernment. De Staël was at this time enthusiastic about a mixture of Rousseau's ideas about love and [[Montesquieu]] in politics. In December 1788 her father instigated the king to double the number of deputies from the [[Third Estate]] in order to gain enough support for raising the taxes as the support the revolutionaries in America had been too costly.

&lt;!--In January 1791 she went back to Paris.--&gt;The increasing disturbances caused by the Revolution made her privileges as the consort of an ambassador very important safeguards.

(Since 1 February France and Great Britain were at war.) Within a few weeks she got pregnant, apparently one of the reasons she caused a scandal in England.

In the summer of 1793, she returned to Coppet Castle perhaps while De Narbonne stopped loving her.

If she could only govern herself, she might have governed the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZYnJqRMaxrIC&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;ots=J4RCvZoOaj&amp;dq=swedish%20embassy%20paris%20address%20chapel%20Baron%20Sta%C3%ABl%20address%20location&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA304#v=onepage&amp;q=swedish%20embassy%20paris%20address%20chapel%20Baron%20Sta%C3%ABl%20address%20location&amp;f=false Mistress to an Age: A Life of Madame de Staël by J. Christopher Herold]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1804 she travelled to Italy, accompanied by her children, Schlegel and the historian [[Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi|Sismondi]]. She met with the poet [[Vincenzo Monti|Monti]] and the painter, [[Angelica Kauffman]]. "Her visit to Italy helped her to further develop her theory of the difference between northern and southern societies..."&lt;ref name="bordoni2005"/&gt;

She returned to Coppet in June 1805, moved to [[Meulan]] (Château d'Acosta) and spent nearly a year writing her next book on Italy's culture and history. In ''Corinne, ou L'Italie'' (1807) the female hero appears to have been inspired by the Italian poet [[Diodata Saluzzo Roero]].&lt;ref name="Letzia"&gt;{{cite book |first=Letizia |last=Panizza |first2=Sharon |last2=Wood |title=A History of Women's Writing in Italy |page=144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She showed all of Italy's works of art still in place, rather than plundered by Napoleon and taken to France.&lt;ref&gt;A. Goodden (2000), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The book's publication acted as a reminder of her existence, and Napoleon &lt;!--([[Joseph Fouché]]?)--&gt; sent her back to Coppet. &lt;!--She stayed there as usual for the summer.--&gt; Her house became, according to [[Stendhal]], "the general headquarters of European thought" and was a debating club hostile to Napoleon, "turning conquered Europe into a parody of a feudal empire, with his own relatives in the roles of [[vassal state]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Fontana, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Récamier, also banned by Napoleon, [[Prince Augustus of Prussia]], [[Charles Victor de Bonstetten]], and [[Chateaubriand]] all belonged to the "[[Coppet group]]".&lt;ref&gt;Herold, J.

Talking seemed to be everybody's chief activity. &lt;!--She invited the (obscure) Danish poet [[Friederike Brun]] to come and stay with her. --&gt;

For a time she lived with Constant in [[Auxerre]] (1806), Rouen (1807), [[Aubergenville]] (1807). Then she met with [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], whose wife [[Dorothea von Schlegel|Dorothea]] had translated ''Corinne'' into German.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel and Madame de Staël have endeavored to reduce [[Poetry#Western_traditions|poetry]] to two systems, classical and romantic.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word [[Romanticism]] was invented by Schlegel, but spread more widely across France through its persistent use by Madame de Staël.&lt;ref&gt;Ferber, Michael (2010) Romanticism: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-956891-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1807 she set out for Vienna and visited [[Maurice O'Donnell]].&lt;ref&gt;Madame de Staël et Maurice O’Donnell (1805–1817), d’apres des letters inedites, by Jean Mistler, published by Calmann-Levy, Editeurs, 3 rue Auber, Paris, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; She was accompanied by her children and August Schlegel who held his famous lectures. &lt;!--She was again at Coppet in the summer of--&gt;In 1808 &lt;!--Benjamin Constant was afraid to admit to her that he had got married in the meanwhile. "If men had the qualities of women", Staël wrote, "love would simply cease to be a problem."&lt;ref&gt;A. Goodden (2000), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;subsequently marrying Charlotte von Hardenberg).--&gt; De Staël set to work on her book about Germany - a country that did not exist until [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] - in which she presented the idea of Germany as an ethical and aesthetic model and praised German literature and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.klassik-stiftung.de/uploads/tx_lombkswdigitaldocs/Jahrbuch_2008_Olaf_Mueller.pdf, Olaf Müller: Madame de Staël und Weimar.

Göttingen: Wallstein Verlag 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange of ideas and literary and philosophical conversations with Goethe, Schiller, and [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]]  inspired de Staël to write one of the most influential books of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Fontana, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pretending she wanted to emigrate to the US, de Staël was given permission to re-enter France. Looking around in Chaumont-sur-Loire de Staël moved into the [[Château de Chaumont]] (1810) owned by the heirs of [[Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont]], but then moved on onto [[Fossé, Loir-et-Cher|Fossé]] and [[Vendôme]]. She was determined to publish ''De l'Allemagne'' in France, a book in which she called French political structures into question, so indirectly criticizing Napoleon busy promoting French culture and theatre. Constrained by censorship, she wrote the emperor a somewhat provocative and perhaps undignified letter.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The minister of police [[Anne Jean Marie René Savary|Savary]] had emphatically forbidden the publication of her book as being “un-French".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=wbQEAAAAYAAJ&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Departure%20for%20Germany%22&amp;f=false Ten Years of Exile, pt. II, chap. i, 101–10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fontana, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1810 de Staël was exiled again and had to leave France within three days. Also [[August Schlegel]] was ordered to leave [[Act of Mediation|Swiss Confederation]] as an enemy of the French literature. She found consolation in a wounded officer named [[Albert de Rocca]], twenty-three years her junior, to whom she got engaged privately in 1811 and would marry him publicly in 1816.&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt;

The operations of the French imperial police in regard to Mme de Staël are rather obscure. She was at first left undisturbed, but by degrees, the chateau itself became a source of suspicion, and her visitors found themselves heavily punished. [[François-Emmanuel Guignard, comte de Saint-Priest|François-Emmanuel Guignard]], De Montmorency and Mme Récamier were exiled for the crime of visiting her. She remained at home during the winter of 1811, planning to escape to England or Sweden with the manuscript. On 23 May 1812 she left Coppet almost secretly, and journeyed through Bern, Innsbruck and Salzburg on her way to Vienna, where she met with [[Metternich]]. There she obtained an Austrian passport up to the frontier, and after some trepidation and trouble, received a Russian passport in [[Brody]]. 

During [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]] de Staël, her two children and Schlegel, journeyed through the [[Habsburg empire]] from [[Brno]] to [[Łańcut]] where Rocca, having deserted the French army and having been searched by the French [[gendarmerie]], was waiting for her. The journey continued to [[Lemberg]], capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. On 14 July 1812 they arrived in [[Volhynia]]. In the meantime, Napoleon, who took a more northern route, had crossed the [[Neman|Niemen River]] with his army. In Kiev, she met [[Miloradovich]], governor of the city. De Staël hesitated to travel to [[Odessa]], [[Constantinople]], and onto Greece, and decided instead to go north. In Moscow, she was invited by the governor [[Fyodor Rostopchin]].&lt;ref&gt;According to de Staël, it was Rostopchin who ordered to set his mansion on fire, which spread to the city with its 1,600 churches. Ten Years' Exile, chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; She left only a few weeks before Napoleon arrived. Until the end of September, her party stayed in Saint Petersburg. She met twice with the tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]] who "related to me also the lessons a la [[Machiavelli]] which Napoleon had thought proper to give him." {{quote|"You see," said he, "I am careful to keep my ministers and generals at variance among themselves, in order that each may reveal to me the faults of the other; I keep up a continual jealousy by the manner I treat those who are about me: one day one thinks himself the favourite, the next day another, so that no one is ever certain of my favour."&lt;ref&gt;Ten Years' Exile, chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;}} For de Staël that was a vulgar and vicious theory.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Years' Exile, chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Kutuzov]] sent her letters from the [[Battle of Tarutino]]&lt;ref name="Tolstoy2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tolstoy|first=Leo|title=The Complete Works of Leo Tolstoy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HJODwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2583|accessdate=12 April 2018| date=21 June 2017|publisher=Musaicum Books| isbn=978-80-7583-455-3|pages=2583–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and before the end of that year he would succeed in chasing the [[Grande Armée]] out of Russia. 

After four months of travelling, she arrived in Sweden. The crossing of the [[Bothnian Gulf]] by boat frightened her. In [[Stockholm]] she started "Ten Years' Exile", giving details of whom she had met and explained what she had seen. She never finished the manuscript and after eight months she set out for England, without August Schlegel who had been appointed as secretary to general [[Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte|Bernadotte]]. (She supported Bernadotte as new ruler of France, who she hoped would introduce a [[constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Zamoyski (2007) Rites of Peace. The fall of Napoleon &amp; the Congress of Vienna, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;) In London she received a great welcome. She met with [[Lord Byron]] on the first evening (27 May). The next day they dined at Sir [[Humphry Davy]]'s, the chemist and inventor. In the evening de Staël had made ''very'' long speeches, according to Byron. She preached English politics to the first of our English [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politicians ... preached politics no less to our [[Tory]] politicians the day after."&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Miscellaneous Prose, p. 184-185. Ed. by Andrew Nicholson (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Her stay was marred by the death of her son Albert, who as a member of the Swedish army had fallen in a duel with a Cossack officer in [[Doberan]] as a result of a gambling dispute. In October [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] published ''De l'Allemagne'' both in a French and English translation, in which she reflected on nationalism and suggested a re-consideration on cultural rather than on natural boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Byron and Germaine de Staël by Silvia Bordoni, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1814, after [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] had been crowned ([[Bourbon Restoration]]) she returned to Paris. She undertook ''Considérations sur la révolution française'', based on Part One of "Ten Years' Exile". Again her salon became a major attraction both for Parisians and foreigners.

When news came of Napoleon's landing on the Côte d'Azur, between Cannes and Antibes, early in March 1815, she fled to Coppet, and never forgave Constant for approving of Napoleon's return.&lt;ref&gt;Fontana, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; Although she had no affection for the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] she succeeded in obtaining restitution for the loan Necker had made to the French state before the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Fontana, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; In October, after the Battle of Waterloo, she set out for Italy, not only for the sake of her own health but for that of her second husband, Rocca, who was suffering from tuberculosis. In May her 19-year-old daughter Albertine married [[Victor, 3rd duc de Broglie]] in [[Livorno]].

The whole family returned to Coppet in June, and [[Lord Byron]] a womanizer and a gambler in debt, left London in great trouble and frequently visited Mme de Staël during July and August. For Byron, she was Europe's greatest living writer, but ...with her pen behind her ears and her mouth full of ink". "Byron was particularly critical of de Staël's self-dramatizing tendencies..."&lt;ref name="erudit2000"&gt;[https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/ron/2000-n19-ron431/005941ar/ Joanne Wilkes, Lord Byron and Madame de Staël: Born for Opposition. London: Ashgate, 1999.] {{ISBN|1-84014699-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Byron was a supporter of Napoleon, but for de Staël "Bonaparte was not only a man but a system..." "Napoleon imposed standards of homogeneity on Europe that is, French taste in literature, art and the legal systems, all of which de Staël saw as inimical to her cosmopolitan point of view."&lt;ref name="erudit2000"/&gt; Byron wrote she was "... sometimes right and often wrong about Italy and England - but almost always true in delineating the heart, which is of but one nation of no country, or rather, of all."&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Miscellaneous Prose, p. 223-224. Ed. by Andrew Nicholson (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Despite her increasing ill-health, she returned to Paris for the winter of 1816–17. Constant argued with de Staël who had asked him to pay off his debts to her. A warm friendship sprang up between Madame de Staël and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], whom she had first met in 1814, and she used her influence with him to have the size of the [[Military occupation|Army of Occupation]] greatly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Longford, Elizabeth]] (1972) ''Wellington-Pillar of State'', p.38.  Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. London.&lt;/ref&gt; She had already become confined to her house at 40, rue des Mathurins, paralyzed since 21 February. She died on 14 July. Her deathbed conversion to Roman Catholicism, after reading [[Thomas a Kempis]], surprised many, including Wellington, who remarked that while he knew that she was greatly afraid of death, he had thought her incapable of believing in the [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Rocca survived her by little more than six months. "Yet although she insisted to the Duke of Wellington that she needed politics in order to live, her attitude towards the propriety of female political engagement varied: at times she declared that women should simply be the guardians of domestic space for the opposite sex, while at others, that denying women access to the public sphere of activism and engagement was an abuse of human rights. This paradox partly explains the persona of the “homme-femme” she presented in society, and it remained unresolved throughout her life."&lt;ref&gt;The Man-Woman and the Idiot: Madame de Staël's Public/Private Life Goodden, Angelica. Forum for Modern Language Studies, 2007, Vol. 43(1), pp.34-45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albertine Necker de Saussure]], married to her cousin, wrote her biography in 1821, published as part of the collected works. [[Auguste Comte]] included Mme de Staël in his ''Calendar of Great Men''. Her political legacy has been generally identified with a stern defence of "liberal" values:  equality, individual freedom and the limitation of power by constitutional rules.&lt;ref&gt;Fontana, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Comte's disciple [[Frederic Harrison]] wrote about de Staël that her novels&lt;!--and her works: "In ''Delphine'' a woman, for the first time since the Revolution, reopened the romance of the heart which was in vogue in the preceding century. Comte would daily recite the sentence from ''Delphine'', 'there is nothing real in the world but love.' (Pos. Pol. iv. 44). "Our thoughts and our acts", he said, "can only give us happiness through results: and results are not often in our own control. Feeling is entirely within our power and it gives us a direct source of happiness, which nothing outside can take away." Her works, Harrison wrote,--&gt; "precede the works of [[Walter Scott]], Byron, [[Mary Shelley]], and partly those of [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], their historical importance is great in the development of modern [[Romanticism]], of the romance of the heart, the delight in nature, and in the arts, antiquities, and history of Europe."

Beside two daughters, Gustava Sofia Magdalena (born July 1787) and Gustava Hedvig (died August 1789), who died in infancy, she had two sons, Ludwig August (1790–1827), Albert (November 1792–July 1813), and a daughter, Albertine, Baroness de Staël von Holstein (June 1797–1838). It is believed Louis, Comte de Narbonne-Lara was the father of Ludvig August and Albert, and Benjamin Constant the father of red-haired Albertine.&lt;ref&gt;Angelica Goodden. ''Madame de Staël: the dangerous exile.'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2008, p. 31?&lt;/ref&gt; With Albert de Rocca, de Staël then aged 46, had one son, the disabled Louis-Alphonse de Rocca (April 1812–1842), who would marry Marie-Louise-Antoinette de Rambuteau, daughter of [[Claude-Philibert Barthelot de Rambuteau]],&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt; and granddaughter of De Narbonne.&lt;ref&gt;L. Moore, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; Even as she gave birth, there were fifteen people in her bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Moore, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the death of her husband, Mathieu de Montmorency became the legal guardian of her children. Like August Schlegel he was one of her intimates until the end of her life.

[[File:Das Abonnement - A film by Ali Limonadi 1.png|thumb|Gudrun Ensslin in "Das Abonnement"]]
'''Gudrun Ensslin''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡuːdʁuːn ˈɛnsliːn|lang}}; 15 August 1940 – 18 October 1977) was a founder of the West German [[far-left]] militant group [[Red Army Faction]] (''Rote Armee Fraktion'', or RAF, also known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang). After becoming involved with co-founder [[Andreas Baader]], Ensslin was influential in the politicization of Baader's anarchistic beliefs.&lt;ref name="madness" /&gt; Ensslin was perhaps the intellectual head of the RAF.  She was involved in five bomb attacks, with four deaths, was arrested in 1972 and died on 18 October 1977 in what has been called [[Stammheim Prison]]'s ''Death Night''.

==Early life==
Ensslin, the fourth of seven children, was born in the village of [[Bartholomä]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]], Germany. Her father, Helmut, was a pastor of the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg|Evangelical Church in Württemberg]]. Ensslin was a well-behaved child who did well at school and enjoyed working with the Protestant Girl Scouts,&lt;ref&gt;"Als Jugendliche wird sie Gruppenführerin beim Evangelischen Mädchenwerk und aktive Gemeindehelferin, die die Bibelarbeit leistet", Gerd Koenen, ''Vesper, Ensslin, Baader'', Köln, Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch, 2003, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; and doing parish work such as organizing Bible studies. In her family, the social injustices of the world were often discussed, and Gudrun is said to have been sensitized to social problems in [[West Germany]] and the world as a whole.

At age eighteen, Ensslin spent a year in the United States, where she attended high school in [[Warren, Pennsylvania]]. She graduated in the Honor Group at Warren High School in 1959.  After returning home, she finished the remaining requirements for her [[Gymnasium (school)|German secondary education]].&lt;ref&gt;the Stuttgart Königin Katharine-Stift, Konen, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like her partner [[Bernward Vesper]] and other members of the [[Red Army Faction]] (such as [[Ulrike Meinhof]] and [[Horst Mahler]]) Ensslin had excellent exam scores and received a scholarship from the [[Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes|German National Academic Foundation]].  Studying at the [[University of Tübingen]], she read education, [[English Studies]], and [[German studies]]. Gudrun Ensslin also met Bernward Vesper in February, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Koenen, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vesper's father [[Will Vesper|Will]] had been a best-selling author before the First World War and joined the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (Nazis) in 1931.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  The senior Vesper kept a pro-Nazi stance until his death in 1962.  The son's life was largely shaped by his father's experiences. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Ensslin's politics harmonized with those of the Vespers,&lt;ref&gt;Koenen, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and the couple made a failed attempt to publish a collection of the senior Vesper's works {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

In Tübingen, together with two other students, Ensslin and Vesper organized a student workshop for new literature which led to a shoestring publishing business called ''Studio neue Literatur''. The first book produced was an anthology of poems against atomic weapons, with many well-known poets from all German-speaking countries&lt;ref&gt;''Gegen den Tod, Stimmen deutscher Schriftsteller gegen die Atombombe, Bernward Vesper, editor, Stuttgart-Cannstatt (Ensslin's parents address), 1964''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a bilingual edition of poems by [[Gerardo Diego]]. In 1963–1964, Gudrun Ensslin earned her elementary school teacher's diploma.  In the summer of 1964, the couple moved to [[West Berlin]] where Gudrun began her thesis on [[Hans Henny Jahnn]] at the Free University.

In 1965, Gudrun's younger sister Johanna married [[Günter Maschke]], then a revolutionary [[Marxist]] poet and member of the [[Situationist International]] group [[Subversive Aktion]], which included [[Rudi Dutschke]] as a member.  Maschke is now a leading conservative antidemocratic intellectual and editor of [[Carl Schmitt]].  Later that year, Gudrun and Bernward were engaged to be married. Both were active on the democratic left-wing, they had well-paid jobs working for the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].  The couple demonstrated together against new security laws, the [[Vietnam War]], an Allied Powers arms show, and for the right to demonstrate.&lt;ref&gt;Koenen, pp. 121, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Vesper neglected his studies, read voraciously, and in 1966 published, with a group of friends, a serious and important series of pamphlets and paperbacks, the ''Voltaire Flugschriften''. In May 1967, Ensslin gave birth to their son [[Felix Robert Ensslin]].

In July or August 1967 Gudrun met [[Andreas Baader]] and they soon began a love affair. Baader had come to Berlin in 1963, to escape ongoing troubles with the [[Munich]] justice system and also to avoid conscription. The young criminal who drifted in and out of [[youth detention center]]s and prison soon became the man of Ensslin's life.&lt;ref&gt;Koenen, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1968, Ensslin broke up with Vesper by phone, informing him that the relationship was already finished before Felix was born.&lt;ref&gt;Koenen, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; An artifact from this time is an experimental film Ensslin participated in entitled ''[[Das Abonnement]]'' (''The Subscription'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/blogs/schroederkalender/2006/10/02/making-of-pornography-15/ Schröder &amp; Kalender » Blog Archive » Making of Pornography (15)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614173916/http://www.taz.de/blogs/schroederkalender/2006/10/02/making-of-pornography-15/ |date=2008-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leader of the Red Army Faction==
In June 1967, Ensslin participated in [[political protest]]s against the [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] during his visit to Germany. Though Western governments viewed the Shah as a reformer, his regime has been criticized for oppression, brutality,&lt;ref name = "Harney 1998"&gt;Harney, ''The Priest'' (1998), pp. 37, 47, 67, 128, 155, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iran"&gt;''Iran Between Two Revolutions'' by Ervand Abrahamian, p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; corruption, and extravagance.&lt;ref name="Harney 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, ''Iranians'' (1998), pp. 236, 260.&lt;/ref&gt;  In what started as a peaceful demonstration at [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], fights broke out between pro-Shah and anti-Shah factions and an innocent young man by the name of [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was fatally shot in the back of the head by a police officer. The police officer, [[Karl-Heinz Kurras]], was revealed in 2009 to be an undercover [[Stasi]] ([[East Germany|East German]] State Security) agent. That night, Ensslin angrily denounced West Germany as a [[fascist]] state at a [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund]] meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Koenen, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Berlin's own urban guerrilla organization, [[Movement 2 June]], named itself after this event.

Kurras was charged with manslaughter and acquitted of the charge on 23 November 1967, which caused public outrage. Matters eventually cooled, which enraged Gudrun Ensslin. She had left Bernward Vesper and her child for good early in 1968 and now she, Andreas Baader and [[Thorwald Proll]] decided to escalate the fight against the system.  They left Berlin around 20 March, and in Munich decided to fire-bomb department stores in Frankfurt, where a [[Socialist German Student Union]] congress was taking place. Together with [[Horst Söhnlein]], they left for Frankfurt on 1 April.

On the night of 2 April 1968, two fires were set in two department stores in [[Frankfurt]]. Baader, Ensslin, Proll and Söhnlein remained in Frankfurt and were arrested three days later. In October 1968, they were sentenced to three years in prison for [[arson]].  After being released pending an appeal in June 1969,  Baader, Ensslin and Proll fled when the appeal was denied. Baader was arrested on 3 April 1970. Ensslin, [[Ulrike Meinhof]], who was at that time a well-known [[leftist]] journalist, and two other women freed him on 14 May 1970. One person was wounded. This was the beginning of the gang's violent actions, and the Red Army Faction. Ensslin became one of the most wanted people in Germany.

In May 1971, Bernward Vesper committed suicide and Felix was sent to live with [[foster parent]]s.&lt;ref name="madness" /&gt;

Ensslin was arrested in a boutique on 8 June 1972 in [[Hamburg]].

==Death==
[[Image:Grabstätte Baader, Raspe, Ensslin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Burial site of Baader, Raspe and Ensslin]]
The Red Army Faction's second generation made several attempts to free Ensslin and her comrades from prison. One attempt involved the kidnapping of [[Hanns-Martin Schleyer]] on 5 September 1977, and a proposed [[prisoner exchange]]. When this failed to work, the RAF orchestrated the [[Landshut Hijacking|hijacking of a Lufthansa airliner]] on 17 October. After the airplane was stormed by a German anti-terrorist unit, Schleyer was killed.

Hours later, in a night that became known as "Death Night", Ensslin, Baader and [[Jan-Carl Raspe]] were found dead in the high security block of [[Stammheim Prison]]. Like Meinhof, Ensslin was found [[hanging|dead by hanging]] in her cell. Andreas Baader and Jan-Carl Raspe were found shot. A fourth member, [[Irmgard Möller]], allegedly stabbed herself four times in the chest with a stolen knife. She recovered from her wounds and has since stated that the deaths were not suicides, but extrajudicial killings undertaken by the German government of the time, a claim strongly denied by the German governments former and present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/people_ensslin.html|title= Gudrun Ensslin (1940–1977)|last=Dugdale-Pointon|first=T.|date=29 August 2007|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One exhaustive study of the RAF by [[Stefan Aust]] (revised in 2009 as "Baader-Meinhof: the inside story of the RAF") seconds the state’s official ruling that the deaths were suicides.  On 27 October 1977, Ensslin was buried in a common grave with Baader and Raspe in the [[Dornhalde Cemetery]] in Stuttgart.

== In film ==
In 1981, [[Margarethe von Trotta]]'s feature film ''[[Marianne and Juliane]]'' presented a fictionalised portrayal of an incarcerated Ensslin ([[Barbara Sukowa]]) and her sister ([[Jutta Lampe]]). Five years later, Sabine Wegner played Ensslin in [[Reinhard Hauff]]'s ''[[Stammheim (film)|Stammheim]]'', a detailed account of the terror trial against Ensslin, Baader, Meinhof and others. Also in 1986, Corinna Kirchhoff played Ensslin in [[Markus Imhoof]]'s ''[[The Journey (1986 film)|The Journey]]'', based on the memoirs of Enssslin's companion Bernward Vesper. In 1997, Anya Hoffmann was Ensslin in Heinrich Breloer's award winning TV [[docudrama]] ''Todesspiel''. Ensslin was portrayed by [[Johanna Wokalek]] in [[Uli Edel]]'s 2008 film ''[[The Baader Meinhof Complex]]'',&lt;ref name=diewelt /&gt;&lt;ref name=azonline /&gt; an adaptation of the non-fiction book of the same name by [[Stefan Aust]].&lt;ref name="cnnBaader"/&gt; Wokalek's performance in the film was rewarded with a nomination for the 2009 [[German Film Awards]] and a [[Bambi (prize)|Bambi]] award as best German actress.&lt;ref name=azonline /&gt;&lt;ref name=Deutscher_Filmpreis_Baader /&gt; The film was chosen as Germany's submission to the [[81st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]], and was already nominated [[66th Golden Globe Awards#Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] for the [[66th Golden Globe Awards]].&lt;ref name="SpiegelGlobe"/&gt;&lt;ref name=german-films2/&gt;&lt;ref name="globes08"/&gt;

In February 2011, [[Andres Veiel]]'s feature film ''[[Wer wenn nicht wir]]'' (''If Not Us, Who?''), in which [[Lena Lauzemis]] plays Gudrun Ensslin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/programm/berlinale_programm/datenblatt.php?film_id=20113348|title=- Berlinale - Archive - Annual Archives - 2011 - Programme - Wer wenn nicht wir - If Not Us, Who|publisher=|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; won the Alfred Bauer Prize and the Prize of the German Art House Cinemas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/media/pdf_word/pm_1/61_berlinale/61_IFB_Awards_2011.pdf|title=- Berlinale -|publisher=|accessdate=13 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113161728/http://www.berlinale.de/media/pdf_word/pm_1/61_berlinale/61_IFB_Awards_2011.pdf|archivedate=13 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].

'''Ivan Bultinovich Kitanov''' (1858-1926) was a Buddhist priest of [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] origin who was born in the Beliavin aimak (''Beliaevskaia stanitsa'') in the Salsk District of the [[Don Cossack Host]].

Lama Kitanov was born in the lunar year of the sheep sometime in 1858. By the age of 27, he became the Baksha of the khurul in his native aimak. His flock knew him by his ecclesiastic name, "Gavang Arash." In 1920, Gavang Arash succeeded [[Shurguchi Nimgirov]] as the "Lama of the Don Kalmyks" and was the last person to officially hold that title. Gavang Arash held that position until 1925 when he was forced to resign due to the anti-religion policies of the Bolsheviks in the [[Don Host Oblast|Don Host]].

[[File:Earl of Clanbrassil.jpg|thumb|right|Clanbrassil]]
'''James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Clanbrassil''' (c.1618 – 20 June 1659), was an [[Ulster-Scots people|Ulster-Scots]] [[Cavalier|Royalist]] peer, soldier and politician.&lt;ref&gt;''Cracroft's Peerage: The Complete Guide to the British Peerage and Baronetage'' - 'Clanbrassill, Earl of (I, 1647 - 1675)' http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/clanbrassill1647.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Clanbrassil was the son of [[James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye|The 1st Viscount Claneboye]] and Jane Philips. His father had been an agent for [[James VI of Scotland]] and was granted a large amount of land in [[Ireland]] following James' accession to the English throne.

Clanbrassil sat in the [[Irish House of Commons]] as the Member of Parliament for [[Down (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Down]] between 1634 and 1635. Upon the outbreak of the [[English Civil War|civil war in England]], he raised a regiment of foot and a troop of horse in support of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. The force was maintained for eight years at Clanbrassil's own expense. He succeeded to his father's viscountcy in 1644.&lt;ref&gt;''Cracroft's Peerage: The Complete Guide to the British Peerage and Baronetage'' - 'Clanbrassill, Earl of (I, 1647 - 1675)' http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/clanbrassill1647.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Following the defeat of the king by the forces of [[Roundhead|Parliament]], Clanbrassil's estates were seized by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. On 7 June 1647, Charles I created him '''Earl of Clanbrassil''' in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] in recognition for his service.&lt;ref&gt;James Seaton Reid, ''The history of the Presbyterian church in Ireland'', Volume 2 (Waugh and Innes, 1837), 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Clanbrassil was one of a number of [[Protestant]] Royalists who were allowed to return to their estates under [[The Protectorate]], and did so in 1654 in return for a payment of £9,435. He was succeeded by his second son.&lt;ref&gt;''Cracroft's Peerage: The Complete Guide to the British Peerage and Baronetage'' - 'Clanbrassill, Earl of (I, 1647 - 1675)' http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/clanbrassill1647.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1638 he was betrothed to [[Mary Rich, Countess of Warwick|Lady Mary Boyle]], the 13-year-old  daughter of [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork|The 1st Earl of Cork]]. The  marriage, however, never took place, as Mary, despite intense pressure from her formidable father,  absolutely refused to marry him, on the unflattering  ground  that she found him  physically repulsive. This defiance of a father's wishes,  particularly in such  a young girl, was almost unprecedented at the time. Mary, however, was noted  from an early age for her extraordinary strength of character. Even her father ruefully admitted that he was unable to control "my unruly daughter", and since he was  genuinely fond of her  he  let the betrothal  lapse.&lt;ref&gt;Lenox-Conyngham, Melosina  ''Diaries  of Ireland''  Lilliput Press Dublin 1993 p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 Sep 1641, he married Lady Anne Carey.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Ohlmeyer, ''Making Ireland English: The Irish Aristocracy in the Seventeenth Century'' (Yale University Press, 2012), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had four children:
*Hon. James Hamilton, styled Viscount Claneboye (1642-1658)
*[[Henry Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Clanbrassill]] (1647–1675)
*Hon. Hans Hamilton
*Lady Jane Hamilton (died unmariried)

'''Jean-Luc Margot''' (born 1969) is a Belgian-born [[astronomer]] and a [[UCLA]] professor who specializes in [[planetary science]]s.

==Career==

Margot has discovered and studied several [[binary asteroid]]s with radar and optical telescopes. His discoveries include [[Romulus (moon)|(87) Sylvia I Romulus]], [[Linus (moon)|(22) Kalliope I Linus]], [[379 Huenna|S/2003 (379) 1]], [[702 Alauda|(702) Alauda I Pichi üñëm]], and the binary nature of [[69230 Hermes|(69230) Hermes]].

In 2000, he obtained the first  images of binary [[near-Earth asteroid]]s and described formation of the binary by a spin-up process.&lt;ref name=JPL2002/&gt;&lt;ref name="Margot2002" /&gt;  Margot and his research group have studied the influence of sunlight on the orbits and spins of asteroids, the [[Yarkovsky effect|Yarkovsky]] and [[Yarkovsky–O'Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack effect|YORP]] effects.&lt;ref name="NYT2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TaylorMargot2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NugentMargot2012" /&gt;

In 2007, Margot and collaborators determined that [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] has a molten core from the analysis of small variations in the spin rate of the planet.&lt;ref name="Reuters2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Margot2007" /&gt;  These observations also enabled a measurement of the size of the core based on a concept proposed by [[Stan Peale]].&lt;ref name="Peale1976" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MargotPeale2012" /&gt;

In 2012, Margot and graduate student Julia Fang analyzed ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'' data to infer the architecture of planetary systems.&lt;ref name="FangMargot2012" /&gt; They described planetary systems as "flatter than pancakes."&lt;ref name="exo" /&gt; They also showed that many planetary systems are dynamically packed.&lt;ref name="FangMargot2013" /&gt;

Since 2016, he has guided UCLA students in conducting searches for [[technosignature|technosignatures]] with large radio telescopes.&lt;ref name="UT2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Margot2018"/&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Margot was awarded the [[H. C. Urey Prize]] by the [[American Astronomical Society]] in 2004. The [[asteroid]] [[9531 Jean-Luc]] is named after him.

==Background==
Coussan's paternal grandfather, G. Louis Coussan, was a professor at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] and the dean of the college of education there. His grandmother, Mary B. Coussan, taught for the [[Lafayette Parish School Board]]. His father, Dr. George Coussan, a [[Radiology|radiologist]], [[quarterback]]ed the ULL [[Ragin' Cajuns]], when the team played in the [[Grantland Rice Bowl]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in 1970. His mother, the former Jo Ellen Becnel, is a [[real estate broker]] for Van Eaton &amp; Romero in Lafayette. Coussan and his wife, Jennifer Joy, have three children, and attend Our Lady of Fatima [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church]] in Lafayette.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;{{Self-published source|date=June 2017}}

Coussan graduated from the Catholic-affiliated [[St. Thomas More School (Louisiana)|St. Thomas More High School]] in Lafayette and then [[Louisiana State University]] and the [[Louisiana State University Law Center]], both in Baton Rouge.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coussan.com/meet-jean-paul/|title=About Jean-Paul|publisher=Coussan.com|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=June 2017}}

==Career==
A partner at the Lafayette real estate law firm, Andrus Boudreaux Complete Title, Coussan also co-founded Cougar Constructione. He was formerly affiliated with Ottinger Hebert, LLC, at which his clients came mainly from [[oil]] and [[natural gas]]. He  previously served on the commission overseeing the Lafayette [[Cajundome]]. His other affiliations include the [[Chamber of Commerce]], the Acadian Homebuilders Association, the [[Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society]], and the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;{{Self-published source|date=June 2017}}

Coussan won his seat in a [[runoff election]] held on November 21, 2015, over fellow Republican Andre' Comeaux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11212015/11212015_Legislative.html|title=Election Returns|date=November 21, 2015|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had emerged as the top two candidates from the October 24 [[primary election]] in which a third contender, Republican Jan Swift, was eliminated from further consideration.&lt;ref name=thelafadv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/2015/11/21/house-45-comeaux-coussan-tied-early-voting/76119758/|title=Jean-Paul Coussan wins House District 45 race|author=Claire Taylor|date=November 22, 2015|publisher=''Lafayette Daily Advertiser''|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his freshman term, Coussan has proved to be a competent negotiator in the Legislature, often working behind the scenes to affect change. He was part of the "Gang of Eight" as described by political columnist [https://lapolitics.com/ Jeremy Alford], who led the charge in 2016 to elect [[Taylor Barras]] as the first independent Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, bucking the tradition of supporting the governor's chosen leader. Later that same year, Coussan was among the "Gang of No" who voted repeatedly against proposed tax increases and other tax measures pushed by then newly-installed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[John Bel Edwards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://710keel.com/state-house-of-representatives-vote-to-increase-sales-tax/|title=State House of Representatives Vote to Increase Sales Tax|date=February 25, 2016|publisher=[[KEEL]]|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; working instead on compromise legislation to put a temporary sales tax increase in place set to expire in 2018, providing time to craft long-term fiscal reform to the state budget.

As a result of these and other voted during a series of special legislative sessions in his first year in office, Coussan was ranked the 12th most conservative member of the legislature by the American Conservative Union in 2016, which [http://acuratings.conservative.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/08/Louisiana_2016_web.pdf ranked legislators] who vote "most consistently with the ideals articulated in the U.S. Constitution: limited transparent government, individual rights, personal responsibility, and lasting cultural values."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acuratings.conservative.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/08/Louisiana_2016_web.pdf|title=2016 Ratings of Louisiana|website=Acuratings.conservative.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named a "Business Champion" at the [http://allianceswla.org/ Chamber SWLA]'s annual LegisGator Awards in 2016 and 2017. The Louisiana Association of Business and Industry gave him honorable mentions in 2016 and 2017 on its [http://www.labi.org/newsroom/an-inside-look-into-the-state-capitol-labi-releases-legislative-scorecard annual legislative scorecard], along with legislators who worked to advance "a platform of positive, pro-growth measures to improve Louisiana's economic climate." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.labi.org/newsroom/an-inside-look-into-the-state-capitol-labi-releases-legislative-scorecard|title=An Inside Look into the State Capitol: LABI Releases Legislative Scorecard – LABI: Louisiana Association of Business and Industry|website=Louisiana Association of Business and Industry|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in both of his two years serving in the House, Coussan maintained a 100% voting record&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfib.com/assets/Louisiana2017_VR_corrected.pdf|title=Voting Record Inside: Are Your Legislators Working for Small Business?|last=NFIB - Louisiana|first=|date=|website=Nfib.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the NFIB who named him a Guardian of Small Business.

'''John Edward Swindler''' ([[circa|''c.'']] 1944 &amp;ndash; June 18, 1990) was executed at the age of 46 by the State of [[Arkansas]] for the September 24, 1976, murder of Patrolman Randy Basnett, age 30.

== The murder == 

John Edward Swindler shot and killed Patrolman Randy Basnett in the afternoon of September 24, 1976. Officer Basnett had stopped at a service station at the Kelly Highway exit in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], when Swindler also stopped there in a stolen car with a [[South Carolina]] [[Vehicle registration plate|license plate]]. Swindler was returning to [[Leavenworth, Kansas]] to settle some personal grudges that had arisen when he had been imprisoned there. Passing the [[Interstate 540 (Arkansas)|I-540]] exit on [[Interstate 40|I-40]] near [[Van Buren, Arkansas]], the illiterate Swindler became confused and exited, driving across the [[Arkansas River]] and into Fort Smith. That morning, Basnett had been briefed to be on the lookout for Swindler, who was the suspect in the double murders of teenagers Gregory L. Becknell and Dorothy Ann Rhodes in South Carolina and other felonies in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and South Carolina. The briefing contained information about Swindler's description, the car he was thought to be driving, and the fact that he was considered to be armed and dangerous. After he noted Swindler and the stolen car, Basnett radioed dispatchers that Swindler was at the service station. Back-up officers were immediately dispatched to his location.

Before additional help arrived, officer Basnett approached Swindler's car and asked for identification. Without warning, Swindler pulled a revolver and shot Basnett twice in the chest.  Basnett, who was standing beside the car, returned fire before collapsing, slightly wounding Swindler. Swindler attempted to flee, but being unfamiliar with Fort Smith, took a road that trailed off into a dead end in a soybean field on the Arkansas River. He was captured there within minutes by police officers who had answered Basnett's call. When officers arrested Swindler, he had several weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his possession. 

Officer Randy Basnett died in the ambulance on the way to Sparks Regional Medical Center.

== Execution ==

A legislative act in 1983 made [[lethal injection]] the only method of execution in Arkansas. However, inmates who had been sentenced to death before the legislation was adopted were allowed to choose between lethal injection and [[electric chair|electrocution]]. When [[Charles Laverne Singleton]] chose lethal injection, John Edward Swindler earned the distinction of being the last inmate to die in Arkansas' electric chair. 

Swindler refused to choose between lethal injection and the electric chair, according to the Arkansas Department of Correction. By not choosing, Swindler effectively selected electrocution.  Warden David White said Swindler might have wanted the notoriety of being the last Arkansas inmate to die in the electric chair. His was also the only execution in the new electric chair constructed by the state in the 1970s.

Swindler was the first person executed by the state of Arkansas since ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|408|238|1972}}, after new capital punishment laws were passed in Arkansas and that came into force on March 23, 1973.

After the Swindler execution, electrocution was made available to inmates who chose it. Further legislation stipulated that electrocution is authorized, but only if lethal injection is found unconstitutional.

'''King Wallis Vidor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|iː|d|ɔr}}; February 8, 1894 – November 1, 1982) was an American film director, film producer, and screenwriter whose career spanned nearly seven decades. In 1979, he was awarded an [[Honorary Academy Award]] for his "incomparable achievements as a cinematic creator and innovator."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0896542/awards Award list for King Vidor]&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated five times for a [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director Oscar]], and won eight international film awards during his career. Vidor's best known films include ''[[The Big Parade]]'' (1925), ''[[The Crowd (1928 film)|The Crowd]]'' (1928), ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' (1937), and ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946). He is not related to fellow director [[Charles Vidor]].

==Early life and career==
Vidor was born in [[Galveston, Texas]], the son of Kate (Wallis) and Charles Shelton Vidor, a lumberman.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/02/obituaries/king-vidor-88-director-of-films-for-more-than-40-years-is-dead.html&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, Károly (Charles) Vidor, was a refugee of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], who settled in Galveston in the early 1850s. He survived the great [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]].  Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled "Southern Storm", for the May 1935 issue of [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'' magazine]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Erik Larson (author)|Larson, Erik]]|year=1999|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/isaacsstorm/book/index.html|title=Isaac's Storm|publisher=[[Random House]] Publishing|ISBN= 0-609-60233-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember now that it seemed as if we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea.  As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away.  I felt as if the sea was going to break over the edge of the bowl and come pouring down upon us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:King Vidor on a Hacker.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|King Vidor, with megaphone, and crew on a [[Hacker-Craft]] speedboat to film water sequences for his 1928 MGM&amp;nbsp;picture, ''[[The Patsy (1928 film)|The Patsy]]''.]]

A freelance [[newsreel]] cameraman and cinema [[projectionist]], Vidor made his debut as a director in 1913 with ''The Grand Military Parade''. In Hollywood from 1915, he worked as a screenwriter and as director of a series of at least ten&lt;ref name="VpR7J8Qd6z0C" &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VpR7J8Qd6z0C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24 King Vidor, American By Raymond Durgnat, Scott Simmon, page 24]&lt;/ref&gt; short juvenile-delinquency films for [[Judge Willis Brown]] before directing his first feature, ''[[The Turn in the Road]]'', in 1919. A successful mounting of ''[[Peg o' My Heart (1922 film)|Peg o' My Heart]]'' in 1922 won him a long-term contract with Goldwyn Studios (later to be absorbed into [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]).  Three years later he made ''[[The Big Parade]]'', among the most acclaimed war films of the silent era, and a tremendous commercial success.  This success established him as one of MGM's top studio directors for the next decade. In 1928, Vidor received his first Oscar nomination, for ''[[The Crowd (1928 film)|The Crowd]]'', widely regarded as his masterpiece and one of the greatest American silent films.  In the same year, he made the classic ''[[Show People]]'', a comedy about the film industry starring Marion Davies (in which Vidor had a cameo as himself), and his much-loved screwball comedy ''[[The Patsy (1928 film)|The Patsy]]'', which also starred Davies and was his last silent film.

Vidor's first sound film was ''[[Hallelujah (film)|Hallelujah]]'', a groundbreaking film featuring an African-American cast. He had no difficulty adjusting to sound and he continued making feature films until the late 1950s. Some of his better known sound films include ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'', ''[[Our Daily Bread (1934 film)|Our Daily Bread]]'', ''[[The Citadel (film)|The Citadel]]'', ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'', ''[[The Fountainhead (film)|The Fountainhead]]'', and ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]''. He directed the Kansas sequences in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (including "[[Over the Rainbow]]" and the [[tornado|twister]]) when director [[Victor Fleming]] had to replace [[George Cukor]] on ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', but did not receive screen credit.

[[File:The Family Honor (1920) - 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|King Vidor, February 21, 1920 ''Exhibitors Herald''.]]

In 1962, he was head of the jury at the [[12th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale 1962"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1962/04_jury_1962/04_Jury_1962.html |title=12th Berlin International Film Festival: Juries |accessdate=February 1, 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 he was a member of the jury at the [[6th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow1969"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://36.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff36/eng/archives/?year=1969 |title=6th Moscow International Film Festival (1969) |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |work=MIFF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vidor was entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for the longest career as a film director: beginning in 1913 with ''Hurricane in Galveston'' and ending in 1980 with ''The Metaphor'', a 36-minute documentary featuring the painter Andrew Wyeth. He was nominated five times for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] but never won in direct competition; he received an honorary award in 1979.

===William Desmond Taylor===
In 1967, Vidor researched the unsolved 1922 murder of fellow director [[William Desmond Taylor]] for a possible screenplay.  Vidor never published or wrote of this research during his lifetime, but biographer [[Sidney D. Kirkpatrick]] posthumously examined Vidor's notes. He alleged, in his 1986 book ''A Cast of Killers'', that Vidor had solved the sensational crime but kept his conclusions private to protect individuals still living at the time. The widely cited newsletter ''Taylorology'' later noted over 100&amp;nbsp;factual errors in ''Cast of Killers'' and strongly disputes Kirkpatrick's conclusions, but credits the book with renewing popular interest in the crime.

==Personal life==

In 1944 Vidor, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]],&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=EfI0AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&lt;/ref&gt; joined the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]].

Vidor published his autobiography, ''A Tree is a Tree'', in 1953. This book's title is inspired by an incident early in Vidor's Hollywood career. Vidor wanted to film a movie in the locations where its story was set, a decision which would have greatly added to the film's production budget. A budget-minded producer told him, "A rock is a rock. A tree is a tree. Shoot it in [[Griffith Park]]" (a nearby public space which was frequently used for film exterior shots).

King Vidor was a [[Christian Scientist]] and wrote occasionally for church publications, such as "The Bible" and the hit, "Truth Be Told."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vidor|first=King Wallis|title=THAT WHICH HATH BEEN IS NOW|url=http://journal.christianscience.com/issues/1961/3/79-3|work=Christian Science Journal, Vol. 79, Issue 3|publisher=Christian Science Publishing Society|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Big Brother 6'' housemates (UK)}}
{{Refimprove|date=June 2012}}
This is a list of the housemates of [[Big Brother 6 (UK)|sixth series]], broadcast in 2005, of the [[Big Brother (UK)|UK version of ''Big Brother'']], where they were observed by television viewers 24 hours a day, and each week one or more housemates were voted to be evicted by the general public until the winner, Anthony Hutton, was left.

There were sixteen housemates in total; thirteen housemates entered on day one and they were joined by three more on Day 29. They entered the ''Secret Garden'' which was decorated like a jungle, and the three secret housemates were initially only supplied with fig leaves to cover only the main essentials of their bodies. This created the idea of an Adam and Eve style jungle. With Makosi's help, they had to steal clothes and food from the main Big Brother House when the other housemates were asleep, and to make sure that the other housemates did not find out about them. At the end of their stay, Makosi had to choose two of the three secret housemates to enter the main house. She chose Orlaith and Eugene, although Kinga re-entered the house after Orlaith walked out on Day 65.

==Anthony==
{{main|Anthony Hutton}}
Anthony Hutton&lt;ref name="register1837"&gt;''Index of Births, Marriages and Deaths in England and Wales, 1837-1983.''&lt;/ref&gt; (born March 1982) is a 70s dancer and apprentice hairdresser from [[Consett]] in County Durham. Anthony won ''Big Brother 6'' with 57.2% of the vote, narrowly beating Eugene and walking away with £50,000.

Since leaving the house Anthony experienced a taste of fame, but this was short-lived and, despite the occasional television or public appearance, Anthony has now returned to his home town and returned to normal life.

Anthony became famous in the house for his variety of catchphrases, including "[[wiktionary:alreet|alreet!]]" (All right in his [[Geordie]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]]), "Mint" (meaning something is good), "Let's get it on", and shouting out "Taxi".
Anthony and Makosi were often seen as a potential couple, after a drunken night in the pool they both claimed nothing sexual happened between them, however less than 48 hours later Makosi stated that she was pregnant with Anthony's baby, although she never told him this, she later claimed she received her period and that she was not pregnant. On the final night, third placed Makosi told [[Davina McCall]] that she was telling the truth when she said she was pregnant, during Anthony's interview he looked shocked when McCall told him about Makosi's pregnancy claims and said that they never had sex, during this the crowd chanted 'Liar, Liar' at Makosi. However, the story has been backed up in print by [[List of Big Brother 6 housemates (UK)#Orlaith|Orlaith McAllister]]. Fellow housemate Maxwell believes they had sexual intercourse too, and Craig also thought this at the time, but later changed his story (it is not known when Craig changed his opinion on the matter), during Makosi's interview she said that she wouldn't believe what Craig is saying because "he probably wanted to shag Anthony." Makosi sold her story to the ''[[News of the World]]'' and claimed she did have sex with Anthony. The same day the story went on sale, both contestants appeared on the [[BBLB]] Reunion show. During his interview, incensed at Makosi stating she could prove it whilst Anthony was being interviewed, Anthony shouted over to her "You know you can't, you're an absolute liar!" and had to be told to calm down by the show's presenter, [[Dermot O'Leary]].

During Anthony's stay in the house he became close with a fellow contestant, gay hairdresser [[List of Big Brother 6 housemates (UK)#Craig|Craig Coates]]; it was widely spread amongst the fellow contestants and the media that Craig was obsessing over Anthony and this caused him to be branded with the "[[bunny boiler]]" image on the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.co.uk/archive/other/2005/07/31/watch-out-ant-craig-s-a-psycho-102039-15800443/|title=News: latest stories, exclusives, opinion &amp; analysis - Mirror Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his eviction from the house Craig was shocked that he had been branded a "bunny boiler" and refused to endorse it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Since leaving Big Brother, Anthony has refused to criticise Craig.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Craig has said in a radio interview that he is no longer friends with Anthony, although their friendship was the butt of jokes in the 17 August 2006 edition of ''[[Big Brother's Little Brother]]'', where Anthony was a phone-in guest.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Anthony appeared in the 2005 and 2006 series of [[Sky One]]'s The Match producing credited appearances noticed by the Legends his Celebrity squad faced. But most notably by the viewers who voted him to receive the Man of the Match award in both series he has appeared in show.

Upon leaving the house Anthony, like the vast majority of the other ex-housemates, received attention from the press and the public; this sustained Anthony as a celebrity for a short period of time, with Anthony making various public and television appearances, such as appearing on the Sky One reality television series, ''[[The Match (TV series)|The Match]]'', and various photo shoots (some naked) for magazines and [[tabloid newspaper]]s. Anthony also released a work-out video which revolved around his 70s disco dance movements; despite winning [[Big Brother UK series 6|Big Brother]], Anthony's work-out DVD failed to sell well.

In September 2007, he featured in the [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky TV]] production, ''[[Premier League All Stars]]'' football show representing [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

In September 2010, Anthony re-entered the house for [[Ultimate Big Brother]] as part of the retrospective task. He had a date with ex housemate [[Makosi Musambasi]].

==Craig==
Craig Jonathan Coates&lt;ref name="register1984" /&gt; (born October 1984) is a former hair stylist from Cromer, Norfolk. His two most recent hairdressing salons, one in Norwich, one in Cromer, have both failed financially.

During his time in the house Craig immediately created 'Team Britney' along with Lesley and Vanessa. When Lesley was evicted on Day 15 Craig began to align himself with Anthony, Maxwell and Saskia. Craig then developed what was interpreted by the media as an unsettling obsession with Anthony, which resulted in several awkward moments.

Craig finished fifth, and was evicted on Day 76 in a surprise final week eviction having received just 3.9% of the vote to win.

He has since been infamous for being recorded in a "Leslie Grantham" style video recorded on a web cam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holymoly.com&lt;/ref&gt;

He has recently begun working at an MTS assistant at the Tate Gallery.

Since leaving the BB house, Sully has presented the breakfast show on Mercury FM (Surrey &amp; Sussex) and appeared on ''[[Blue Peter]]'', ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the children's show ''[[Dick and Dom in da Bungalow]]'' as well as being a contestant on the BBC Two quiz show ''[[Eggheads (TV series)|Eggheads]]'' with a team he called "Eugenius", he has also carried out interviews on various radio stations and also appeared on ''Brainiac: Test Tube Baby'' where he set up experiments and was judged and got 20 out of 30 (2006). He also appeared on Channel 4's "''8 Out Of 10 Cats: Big Brother Special''" in August 2006, August 2007, and September 2010.

== Kinga ==
Kinga Karolczak ({{IPA-pl|ˈcĩŋɡa ˈkarɔlʧ̑ak|}}; born 19 April 1985) is a half Polish, half Kuwaiti market researcher from London. She initially entered into the house through the Secret Garden with fellow newcomers Eugene and Orlaith. She is most famous for masturbating with a wine bottle in the garden. One of her first actions was to expose one of her 34FF breasts out of her bikini top.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Makosi - who had received a secret mission to be the only original housemate to be aware of and interact between the two houses - chose Eugene and Orlaith to go into the main house over her.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

After Orlaith left the house, Kinga re-entered. During her relatively short stay in the house Kinga acted wildly. She developed a rather surprising bond with Derek, with each of them often singing serenades to one another, and Derek curiously fondling her breasts while the two were in the pool. Even though Kinga was only in the house for eleven days she etched herself into the public consciousness when she apparently masturbated using a wine bottle in the garden. She managed to receive more votes to win the show than fellow housemate Craig who was evicted during the final week after failing to receive enough votes to win the series, this secured Kinga a place in the final night. Kinga finished fourth and left on the final night. Kinga was signed up to an exclusive magazine deal rumoured to be worth a 6 figure sum.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
Since the house Kinga has featured in many newspaper and magazine articles. She has been a guest on shows including ''Trisha Goddard'', ''Big Brother's Little Brother'' and ''Big Brother's Big Mouth'', Friday and the ''Sunday Night Project'', ''The Charlotte Church Show'', ''Celebrity Moments'' and many more. In 2006 she played at the ''Celebrity World Cup Soccer Six Tournament''. In April 2011, she appeared in come dine with me (A Royal Wedding Special)
Kinga landed a part in the feature film ''[[Cash and Curry (film)|Cash and Curry]]'', starring [[Ameet Chana]], [[Faria Alam]] and [[Lee Latchford-Evans]], which was released in late 2007. In summer 2007 she was the ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' columnist for the ''[[Daily Sport]]'' newspaper. In October 2008 she made a guest appearance on the [[E4 (channel)|E4]] horror series ''[[Dead Set (TV series)|Dead Set]]'', in a cameo as herself. Kinga since leaving the house has lost over 3 stone and is barely recognisable with her recent{{When|date=July 2010}} glamour modelling shots done with the News of the World calling her one of the sexiest Big Brother babes ever{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and is still regularly seen in the media.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Lesley==
Lesley Anne Sanderson&lt;ref name="register1984" /&gt; (born 24 November 1985) was a sales assistant from [[Huddersfield]]. She was the second person to be evicted from the Big Brother house, on 10 June [[Big Brother UK series 6#Weeks 1 and 2|(Day 15)]], gaining 36% of the public vote, all housemates faced eviction in Week 2 as punishment for Vanessa's rule breaking, on this eviction night, housemates could hear the crowd cheering and booing their favourites and least favourites, Sanderson received the biggest boos, as viewers labelled her a bully. Whilst staying in the house she, along with Craig and Vanessa, were noted for bullying fellow housemate Sam, which angered housemates such as Anthony and Maxwell who both got involved in an argument with her over the way she was treating her. Despite getting told off for her nasty behaviour by Big Brother, she seemed genuinely shocked at hearing the crowd boo her on her eviction. In Autumn 2005, Sanderson was allegedly raped in a hotel in [[Leeds]].{{ref|uk.tv.yahoo.com.LS4}} Also she claims that since Big Brother she has struggled to cope with fame and developed a drinking problem.

After leaving the Big Brother House, Sanderson embarked on a singing career, which failed. She was due to record a single called "Hated" and plans to write a book about her experiences.{{ref|www.people.co.uk.LS8}} ''[[The People]]'' reported that she was paid £15,000 for Big Brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16364737%26method=full%26siteid=93463%26headline=exclusive%2d%2dbig%2dbro%2druined%2dme-name_page.html Big Bro Ruined Me] ''The People'', 13 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Lesley now works as a counsellor.

==Mary==
Mary O'Leary (born 30 May 1974) claims to be a psychic advisor, writer, and non-practising [[white witch]] who was born to a former priest and nun in Dublin, Ireland. She claims to remember a past life in [[Atlantis]] and that she has been [[alien abduction|abducted by aliens]] seven times. She wanted to leave the house just hours after entering, however she soon began to enjoy her time in the house, formed friendships and celebrated her 31st birthday by having a witch themed party. She accused Saskia of having breast implants and had an explosive row with her over this, she spent the following day lying in bed, refusing to get up and wanting to leave, she also insulted most of her housemates - branding them 'wannabes' and 'scum of the earth', Makosi - as part of her secret mission - secretly nominated Mary as a favour. She was the first to be evicted, and branded Makosi a snake in the grass for nominating her.

After Big Brother, Mary had aspirations to become an actress and later said that being a witch was a very minor part of her personality.  For a period she was also reportedly homeless and living on the streets.

She has since embarked on a successful falafel selling business.

==Maxwell==
Maxwell Trotter Ward (born 1981) is from [[Islington]], North London and supports [[Arsenal Football Club]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} He was noted for his chirpy [[cockney]] attitude and catchphrase; "off the hook". In the house he maintained a good friendship with fellow housemate Anthony. He had a reputation for his disproportionate top lip, his bad breath and his pranks. In Week 2, when all housemates faced eviction, he, along with Saskia received the biggest cheers from the crowd. They would go on to have a relationship, they were both nominated for eviction in Week 5 and isolated themselves from a number of housemates, and were involved in several arguments that week.  Maxwell was reprimanded by Big Brother for throwing water over Kemal after he accused them of  'trying to get a magazine deal.' He was the sixth evictee from the house, and left on 8 July, with 57% of the vote.

==Orlaith==
Orlaith McAllister (born 26 April 1979) is a model from [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]. She was runner up in the 1999 [[Miss Northern Ireland]] competition, losing out to [[Zöe Salmon]]. She entered the house on Day 29 and was directed to the Secret Garden with fellow new housemates Eugene and Kinga. Makosi chose Orlaith along with Eugene to enter the main house on Day 32. Orlaith was initially popular with housemates, she became known for allowing them to touch her surgically enhanced breasts, she was also involved in the infamous 'Poolnight' on Day 37. She became friends with Makosi and Vanessa, however they began bitching about her in Week 7, on Day 48, Makosi even threatened to have a [[cat fight]] with her whilst Kemal also made threats about her on the same night.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Orlaith began to feel unhappy in the house and expressed her desire to leave, despite this, the public did not choose to evict her, On Day 50 the public chose Makosi and Vanessa as the least popular of the six housemates who faced eviction that week, this meant that Orlaith along with Eugene were the first ever late entrants to survive a public vote.

On Day 52, Kemal began to isolate her and had an argument with her in the living room. On Day 54, Orlaith had a massive row with Science, and broke down in tears, she was comforted by her arch enemy Derek, later that day both Orlaith and Science were told that the housemates had chosen both of them to face eviction, Orlaith pleaded with the public to vote her out, although later that week she told housemates that she didn't think she will go - it is possible this was just a ploy to prompt viewers to vote her out. She narrowly survived eviction against Science - who got evicted with 50.5% of the vote - in what is the closest eviction in the history of ''Big Brother''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Orlaith was also the only female of this series to survive an eviction vote against a male housemate - not counting Kinga and Makosi who survived a winning vote against Craig.

Orlaith was given a secret mission on Day 59, in which she was given a vibrating device and had to give a hug to whoever was next to her when the device vibrated, however Makosi sussed her out, but Orlaith pretended she was given a phone as she was feeling so upset in the house. Later that week she was nominated for eviction against her rival Kemal, she survived him in another close vote (51.1%). When Kemal left the house he called Orlaith's bluff about wanting to leave, however the following morning (Day 65) she quit and was replaced by Kinga. She received a huge amount of media coverage after she left the house, appearing regularly in [[lads mags|lads' mags]] and on [[Page Three|Page 3]].

Orlaith gave birth to her first child, a daughter Eva in February 2007.  She gave birth to her second child, a son Anthony in April 2009.

==Sam==
Samantha Leanne Heuston&lt;ref name="register1837" /&gt; (born January 1982 in London, England) is a marketing student from [[Cheam]] in southwest London. Her time in the house is best remembered for her raunchy behaviour such as her choice of clothing, which mainly consisted of a bikini, the lapdance she performed for Anthony, her kiss with Makosi, telling Big Brother she was feeling horny and masturbating in a cardboard box.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} She also suffered continuous bullying by a number of housemates, mainly Lesley.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

She was the third person to be evicted from the Big Brother House, when faced against [[#Derek Laud|Derek]] and [[#Roberto Conte|Roberto]]. She received 59% of the public vote when she was voted out on 17 June [[#Weeks 3 and 4|(Day 22)]]. On her eviction, someone in the crowd threw water at her.

Whilst in the house she formed a relationship with Maxwell and friendships with Anthony, Sam, and later on Craig.

She had two open heart surgery operations which left scars under her breasts. These scars were then used by Mary and Lesley as "evidence" that Saskia had had a boob job, which she denied. Saskia's breasts require a 34FF bra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/article469896.ece "J cup boobs: M&amp;S produce first J cup bra"] The Sun, 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since leaving the house Saskia sustained a short career as a glamour model and regularly appeared in ''[[Nuts (magazine)|Nuts]]'' magazine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
She had been offered the part of 'Sigourney' in a remake of [[Chicken Park]], but declined after finding out that her character has her blouse removed and breasts licked and tickled by a giant [[cockerel]].
Saskia and Maxwell continued their relationship after they left the house for a short while. It was reported in [[OK!|''OK'' magazine]] in February 2007 that Maxwell and Saskia were no longer together and this was confirmed in May 2007 during a Channel 4 programme ''After They Were Housemates'', during which Maxwell confirmed that he was currently moving out after splitting up around six months before.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} She has a pet dog, a [[pug]], named Arthur.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

She was the seventh person to be evicted from the house on Day 50.

The housemates who did nominate were told that they faced eviction, however they didn't, on eviction night Makosi and Vanessa received the most public votes - Makosi (47%), Vanessa (26%) - the housemates had to choose which one to evict, all except for Kemal chose to evict Vanessa.

'''Ma Yize''' ([[Traditional Chinese|traditional]]: 馬依澤, [[Simplified Chinese|simplified]]: 马依泽, ca. 910 - 1005) was a [[Islam during the Song Dynasty|Muslim]] [[Hui Chinese]]
[[Chinese astronomy|astronomer and astronomer]] who worked as the chief official of the astronomical observatory  for the [[Song dynasty]].
{{Islam and China|figures}}
In the early 10th century, the Chinese emperor of the Song dynasty encouraged the advancement of the study of astronomy and its related disciplines. In 961, the Emperor Taizu (r. 960-976) appointed Ma Yize (910?-1005) as the chief official to take charge of the government observatory.

Ma Yize assisted Wang Chuna in compiling several important astrological works, including the [[Yingtianli]] (Calendar of Corresponding Heavens). His job was to provide observation, and computation of the regularities in celestial phenomena, using the [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic methods]]. His findings were used by Wang Chuna in the compilation of Yingtianli, which was completed in 963. The calculation, based on a 7-day week system similar to that in the Islamic calendar, was first adopted in this document, which was the most important occurrence in the Chinese history of calendrical methods.

Ma Yize might have consulted many works of Islamic mathematical astronomy into Chinese, including:
* Kitab al-Zij [Al-Battani sive Albatenni Opus astronomicum], 880, by Abu'Abdallah al-Battani [Latin: Albategni or Albatenius], 858-929
* al-Zij al-sabi [The Sabian Tables]
* Kitab Matali' al-Buruj [On the Ascensions of the Signs of the Zodiac]
* Kitab Aqdar al- Ittisalat [On the Quantities of the Astrological Applications]
It is possible that Ma was influenced by [[Al-Battani]] and [[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani|Al-Hamdani]]. Owing to Ma's contribution to the compilation of 'Yingtianli', Ma was made a hereditary noble and his sons later succeeded his position with the Imperial Observatory.

The '''Man in the Iron Mask''' (French: ''L'Homme au Masque de Fer''; c. 1640 – 19 November 1703) is the name given to an unidentified prisoner who was arrested in 1669 or 1670 and subsequently held in a number of [[Kingdom of France|French]] prisons, including the [[Bastille]] and the Fortress of Pignerol (modern [[Pinerolo]], [[Italy]]). He was held in the custody of the same jailer, [[Bénigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars]], for a period of 34 years. He died on 19 November 1703 under the name "Marchioly", during the reign of King [[Louis XIV of France]] (1643–1715). Since no one ever saw his face because it was hidden by a mask of black velvet cloth, the true identity of the prisoner remains a mystery; it has been extensively debated by historians, and various theories have been expounded in numerous books and films.

Among the leading theories are those proposed by writer and philosopher [[Voltaire]]: he claimed in the second edition of his ''Questions sur l'Encyclopédie'' (1771) that the prisoner wore a mask made of [[cast iron|iron]] rather than of cloth, and that he was the older, illegitimate brother of Louis XIV. What little is known about the historical Man in the Iron Mask is based mainly on correspondence between Saint-Mars and his superiors in Paris. Recent research suggests that his name might have been "Eustache Dauger", a man who was involved in several political scandals of the late 17th century, but this assertion still has not been completely proven.

The [[National Archives of France]] has made available (online) the original data relating to the inventories of the goods and papers of Saint-Mars (one inventory, of 64 pages, was drawn up at the [[Bastille]] in 1708; the other, of 68 pages, at the [[citadel of Sainte-Marguerite]] in 1691). These documents have been sought in vain for more than a century and were thought to have been lost. They were discovered in 2015, among the 100 million documents of the {{ill|Minutier central des notaires de Paris|fr}}.&lt;ref&gt;Archives nationales de France: salle des inventaires, Archives nationales (accessed 23 January 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Analyse et photographies des documents découverts, https://sergearoles-documents-archives.com/ [archive] (accessed 23 January 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; They show that some of the 800 documents in the possession of the jailer Saint-Mars were analysed after his death. These documents confirm the reputed avarice of Saint-Mars, who appears to have diverted the funds paid by the king for the prisoner. They also give a description of a cell occupied by the masked prisoner, which contained only a sleeping mat, but no luxuries, as was previously thought. With the scientific support of the [[National Library of France]] collections of ancient textiles, the accuracy of these notary documents discovered in 2015 has allowed the creation of the first virtual reconstruction of the prison of the man in the iron mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VylqakUOTwY |title=The jail cell of the most famous prisoner, the man in the iron mask. |publisher=YouTube |date=2017-10-18 |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Man in the Iron Mask has also appeared in many works of fiction, most prominently in the late 1840s by [[Alexandre Dumas]]. A section of his novel ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]]'', the final installment of his [[D'Artagnan Romances|D'Artagnan saga]], features the Man in the Iron Mask. Here the prisoner is forced to wear an iron mask and is portrayed as Louis XIV's [[identical twin]].&lt;ref name="BBCdocu" /&gt; Dumas also presented a review of the popular theories about the prisoner extant in his time in the chapter "L'homme au masque de fer" in the sixth volume of his non-fiction ''Crimes Célèbres''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/crimesclbres02dumagoog |title=Crimes célèbres : Alexandre Dumas : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The prisoner==
===Arrest and imprisonment===
The earliest surviving records of the masked prisoner are from late July 1669, when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s minister, the [[François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Marquis de Louvois]], sent a letter to [[Bénigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars]], governor of the prison of [[Pinerolo|Pignerol]], which at the time was part of France.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In his letter, Louvois informed Saint-Mars that a prisoner named "Eustache Dauger" was due to arrive in the next month or so.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
[[File:Pinerolo 001.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The town of [[Pinerolo]], previously Pignerol, in [[Piedmont]], Italy.]]

Louvois instructed Saint-Mars to prepare a cell with multiple doors, one closing upon the other, which were to prevent anyone from the outside listening in.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Saint-Mars himself was to see Dauger only once a day to provide food and whatever else he needed. Dauger was also to be told that if he, Dauger, spoke of anything other than his immediate needs he would be killed, but, according to Louvois, the prisoner should not require much since he was "only a [[valet]]".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Historians have noted that the name Eustache Dauger was written in a handwriting different from that used in the rest of the letter's text, suggesting that a clerk wrote the letter under Louvois' dictation, while someone else, very likely Louvois himself, added the name afterward.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Dauger was arrested by Captain Alexandre de Vauroy, garrison commander of [[Dunkirk]], and taken to Pignerol, where he arrived in late August. Evidence has been produced to suggest that the arrest was actually made in [[Calais]] and that not even the local governor was informed of the event – Vauroy's absence being explained away by his hunting for Spanish soldiers who had strayed into France via the [[Spanish Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Noone" /&gt;

The first rumours of the prisoner's identity (specifically as a [[Marshal of France]]) began to circulate at this point. According to many versions of the legend, the prisoner wore the mask at all times.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===The masked man serves as a valet===
[[File:La masque de fer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Illustration, c. 1872]]
[[File:Masque de fer selon Warin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''L'Homme au masque de fer'', by [[Jean-Joseph Regnault-Warin]]]]
The prison at Pignerol, like the others at which Dauger was later held, was used for men who were considered an embarrassment to the state and usually held only a handful of prisoners at a time.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Saint-Mars' other prisoners at Pignerol included Count [[Ercole Antonio Mattioli]], an Italian diplomat who had been kidnapped and jailed for double-crossing the French over the purchase of the important fortress town of [[Casale Monferrato|Casale]] on the Italian border.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} There was also [[Nicolas Fouquet]], Marquis of Belle-Île, a former superintendent of finances who had been jailed by Louis XIV on the charge of [[embezzlement]], and the [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Marquis de Lauzun]], who had become engaged to the [[Anne, Duchess of Montpensier|Duchess of Montpensier]], a cousin of the King, without the King's consent. Fouquet's cell was above that of Lauzun.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In his letters to Louvois, Saint-Mars describes Dauger as a quiet man, giving no trouble, "disposed to the will of God and to the king", compared to his other prisoners, who were either always complaining, constantly trying to escape, or simply mad.&lt;ref name="Noone" /&gt;

Dauger was not always isolated from the other prisoners. Wealthy and important ones usually had manservants; Fouquet for instance was served by a man called La Rivière. These servants, however, would become as much prisoners as their masters and it was thus difficult to find people willing to volunteer for such an occupation. Since La Rivière was often ill, Saint-Mars applied for permission for Dauger to act as servant for Fouquet.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 1675, Louvois gave permission for such an arrangement on condition that he was to serve Fouquet only while La Rivière was unavailable and that he was not to meet anyone else; for instance, if Fouquet and Lauzun were to meet, Dauger was not to be present.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

It is an important point that the man in the mask served as a [[valet]]. Fouquet was never expected to be released; thus, meeting Dauger was no great matter, but Lauzun was expected to be set free eventually, and it would have been important not to have him spread rumours of Dauger's existence. Historians have also argued that 17th-century protocol made it unthinkable that a man of royal blood would serve as a manservant, casting some doubt on speculation that Dauger was in some way related to the king.&lt;ref name="BBCdocu"&gt;''The Man in the Iron Mask'', [[Timewatch]] TV documentary presented by [[Henry Lincoln]], [[BBC]], 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

After Fouquet's death in 1680, Saint-Mars discovered a secret hole between Fouquet and Lauzun's cells. He was sure that they had communicated through this hole without detection by him or his guards and thus that Lauzun must have been made aware of Dauger's existence. Louvois instructed Saint-Mars to move Lauzun to Fouquet's cell and to tell him that Dauger and La Rivière had been released.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In fact, they were held in another cell in another part of the prison, their presence there being highly secret.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Other prisons===
[[File:Exilles02.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Fortress of Exilles]]]]
[[File:Lerins-iron mask prison.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Île Sainte-Marguerite]]]]
Lauzun was freed in 1681. Later that same year, Saint-Mars was appointed governor of the prison of the [[Exilles Fort|Exiles Fort]] (now [[Exilles]] in Italy). He went there, taking Dauger and La Rivière with him. La Rivière's death was reported in January 1687; in May, Saint-Mars and Dauger moved to [[Île Sainte-Marguerite|Sainte-Marguerite]], one of the [[Lérins Islands]], half a mile offshore from [[Cannes]].

It was during the journey to Sainte-Marguerite that rumours spread that the prisoner was wearing an iron mask. Again, he was placed in a cell with multiple doors.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

On 18 September 1698, Saint-Mars took up his new post as governor of the [[Bastille]] prison in Paris, bringing Dauger with him. He was placed in a solitary cell in the prefurnished third chamber of the Bertaudière tower. The prison's second-in-command, de Rosarges, was to feed him. Lieutenant du Junca, another officer of the Bastille, noted that the prisoner wore "a mask of black velvet".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The masked prisoner died on 19 November 1703 and was buried the next day under the name of "Marchioly". All of his furniture and clothing was reportedly destroyed afterward, the walls of his cell were scraped and whitewashed, and everything of metal which the man had possessed or used was melted down.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1711, King Louis's sister-in-law, [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine]], sent a letter to her aunt, [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], stating that the prisoner had "two [[musketeers]] at his side to kill him if he removed his mask". She described him as very devout, and stated that he was well treated and received everything he desired.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} However, the prisoner had already been dead for eight years by that point and the Princess had not necessarily seen him for herself; rather, she was quite likely reporting rumours she had heard at court.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Popular interest==
The fate of the mysterious prisoner – and the extent of the apparent precautions his jailers took – created significant interest in his story and gave birth to many legends.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Many theories exist and several books have been written about the case. Some were presented after the existence of the letters was widely known. Still later commentators have presented their own theories, possibly based on embellished versions of the original tale.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Theories about his identity popular during his time included that he was a Marshal of France; the English [[Henry Cromwell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dumas|first= Alexandre|title= Celebrated Crimes|volume= 6|page=2008 |date=1910|url= https://archive.org/details/celebratedcrimes06duma}}&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Oliver Cromwell]]; or [[François, Duke of Beaufort]]. Later, many people such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2751 |title=Gutenberg.org |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-09-22 |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested other theories about the man in the mask.

It has even been suggested that he was one of the other famous contemporary prisoners being held at Pignerol at the same time as Dauger.&lt;!--These assumptions may have since been discredited but they are theories that some have taken seriously, especially in the case of Mattioli--&gt;

==Candidates==

===King's relative===
[[Voltaire]] claimed that the prisoner was a son of [[Anne of Austria]] and [[Cardinal Mazarin]], and therefore an illegitimate half-brother of [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]. However, the sincerity of this claim is uncertain.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==== King's twin brother ====
In his history essay ''Le Masque de fer'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Masque de fer|last=Pagnol|first=Marcel|publisher=Éditions de Provence|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=chapters 11 &amp; 12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; French novelist [[Marcel Pagnol]], supporting his theory in particular on the circumstances of King Louis XIV's birth, claims that the Man in the Iron mask was indeed a twin but born second, and hence the younger, and would have been hidden in order to avoid any dispute over the throne holder.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The historians who reject this theory (including [[:fr:Jean-Christian Petitfils|Jean-Christian Petitfils]]), highlight the conditions of childbirth for the queen. It took place usually in public, in front of the main court's figures. But according to Marcel Pagnol, right after the birth of the future Louis XIV, King Louis XIII took his whole court to the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|''Château de Saint-Germain'']]'s chapel to celebrate a ''[[Te Deum]]'' in great pomp, in contrast to the common practice of celebrating it several days before childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;The event has been reported by [[Jean Dumont (publicist)|Jean Dumont]] in the ''Supplément au Corps Universel Diplomatique'', tome IV, page 176.&lt;/ref&gt; That would have allowed the queen to be left alone with her midwife to give birth to the second child.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

To make the context clearer, it should be remembered that there was a controversy at that time over which one of twins was the elder: the one born first or the one who, being born second, would have, as was then thought, been conceived first. In such a situation, the reigning twin would face a serious threat to his throne.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Also supporting the theory of King Louis XIV's twin, a thorough examination of the French Kings' genealogy shows many twin births, in the [[Capetian dynasty]], as well as in the [[House of Valois]], [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] and lastly the [[House of Orléans]].&lt;ref&gt;Yann Kermabon, « Courrier des lecteurs », ''[[:fr:Historia (revue)|Revue Historia]]'', octobre 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexandre Dumas]] explored a similar theory in his book ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'', where the prisoner was instead an [[identical twin]] of Louis XIV. This book has served as the basis – even if loosely adapted – for many [[The Man in the Iron Mask (film)|film versions]] of the story.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

According to Marcel Pagnol’s theory, this twin was then born in 1638, grew up on [[Jersey]] Island, being named [[James de la Cloche]]. Later he would have conspired against King Louis XIV besides [[Roux de Marcilly]], and would have been arrested in Calais in 1669 further to the execution of Roux, who would have denounced him when being tortured.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==== King's father ====
Hugh Ross Williamson&lt;ref name="Williamson2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Who Was The Man In the Iron Mask? and Other Historical Mysteries|first=Hugh Ross| last=Williamson|publisher=Penguin|year=2002|isbn=0-14-139097-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the man in the iron mask was the natural father of Louis XIV. According to this theory, the "miraculous" birth of Louis XIV in 1638 would have come after [[Louis XIII]] had been estranged from his wife [[Anne of Austria]] for 14 years. Furthermore, Louis XIII was old, weak, ill, and not expected to live much longer, and thus may have been impotent at the time, implying that he was not the father.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The theory then suggests that the King's minister, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], had arranged for a substitute, probably an illegitimate son or grandson of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], to become intimate with the queen and father an heir in the king's stead. At the time, the [[heir presumptive]] was Louis XIII's brother [[Gaston, Duke of Orléans]], who was Richelieu's enemy. If Gaston became King, Richelieu would quite likely have lost both his job as minister and his life, and so it was in his best interests to thwart Gaston's ambitions. Louis XIII also hated Gaston and might thus have agreed to the scheme; the queen would have had the same interest, as Gaston would have removed her from any influence.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Supposedly the substitute father then left for the [[New France|Americas]] but in the 1660s returned to France with the aim of extorting money for keeping his secret, and was promptly imprisoned. This theory would explain both the secrecy surrounding the prisoner, whose true identity would have destroyed the legitimacy of Louis XIV's claim to the throne had it been revealed, and also - because of the King's respect for his own father - his comfortable imprisonment and why he was not simply killed.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

This theory was first disputed by British politician [[Hugh Cecil, 1st Baron Quickswood]]. He said the idea has no historical basis and is hypothetical. Williamson held that to say it is a guess with no solid historical basis is merely to say that it is like every other theory on the matter, although it makes more sense than any of the other theories. There is no known evidence that is incompatible with it, even the age of the prisoner, which Cecil had considered a weak point; and it explains every aspect of the mystery.&lt;ref name="Williamson2002" /&gt;

===French general===
{{See also|Great Cipher#The Man in the Iron Mask}}

In 1890, Louis Gendron, a French military historian, came across some coded letters and passed them on to [[Étienne Bazeries]] in the French Army's cryptographic department. After three years Bazeries managed to read some messages in the [[Great Cipher]] of Louis XIV. One of them referred to a prisoner and identified him as General {{ill|Vivien de Bulonde|fr|Vivien l'Abbé de Bulonde}}. One of the letters written by Louvois made specific reference to de Bulonde's crime.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

At the [[Siege of Cuneo (1691)|Siege of Cuneo]] in 1691, Bulonde was concerned about enemy troops arriving from Austria and ordered a hasty withdrawal, leaving behind his munitions and wounded men. Louis XIV was furious and in another of the letters specifically ordered him "to be conducted to the fortress at Pignerol where he will be locked in a cell and under guard at night, and permitted to walk the battlements during the day with a 330 309." It has been suggested that the 330 stood for ''masque'' and the 309 for full stop. However, in 17th-century French ''avec un masque'' would mean "in a mask".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some believe that the evidence of the letters means that there is now little need of an alternative explanation for the man in the mask. Other sources, however, claim that Bulonde's arrest was no secret and was actually published in a newspaper at the time and that he was released after just a few months. His death is also recorded as happening in 1709, six years after that of the man in the mask.&lt;ref name="Noone"&gt;''The Man Behind the Iron Mask'' by John Noone, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===The valet===
In 1801, revolutionary legislator Pierre Roux-Fazillac stated that the tale of the masked prisoner was an amalgamation of the fates of two separate prisoners, [[Ercole Antonio Mattioli]] (see below) and an imprisoned valet named "Eustache D'auger".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Andrew Lang]], in his ''The Valet's Tragedy and Other Stories'' (1903), presented a theory that "Eustache Dauger" was a prison pseudonym of a man called "Martin", valet of the [[Huguenot]] [[Roux de Marcilly]]. After his master's execution in 1669 the valet was taken to France, possibly by capture or subterfuge, and imprisoned because he might have known too much about his master's affairs.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Son of Charles II===
In ''The Man of the Mask'' (1908), Arthur Barnes presents [[James de la Cloche]], the alleged illegitimate son of the reluctant Protestant [[Charles II of England]], who would have been his father's secret intermediary with the Catholic court of France. Louis XIV could have imprisoned him because he knew too much about French affairs with England.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

One of Charles's confirmed illegitimate sons, the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], has also been proposed as the man in the mask. A Protestant, he led [[Monmouth Rebellion|a rebellion]] against his uncle, the Catholic [[James II of England|King James II]]. The rebellion failed and Monmouth was executed in 1685. But in 1768, a writer named Saint-Foix claimed that another man was executed in his place and that Monmouth became the masked prisoner, it being in Louis XIV's interests to assist a fellow Catholic like James who would not necessarily want to kill his own nephew. Saint-Foix's case was based on unsubstantiated rumours and allegations that Monmouth's execution was faked.&lt;ref name="Noone" /&gt;

===Government minister===
Other popular suspects have included men known to have been held at Pignerol at the same time as Dauger. Fouquet himself has been considered, but the fact that Dauger is known to have served as his valet makes this unlikely.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Italian diplomat===
Another candidate, much favoured in the 1800s, was Fouquet's fellow prisoner Count [[Ercole Antonio Mattioli]] (or Matthioli). He was an Italian diplomat who acted on behalf of debt-ridden [[Charles IV, Duke of Mantua]] in 1678, in selling [[Casale Monferrato|Casale]], a strategic fortified town near the border with France. A French occupation would be unpopular, so discretion was essential, but Mattioli leaked the details to France's Spanish enemies, after pocketing his commission once the sale had been concluded, and they made a bid of their own before the French forces could occupy the town. Mattioli was kidnapped by the French and thrown into nearby Pignerol in April 1679. The French took possession of Casale two years later.&lt;ref name="Noone" /&gt;

The prisoner is known to have been buried under the name "Marchioly", and many believe {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} that this is proof enough that he was the man in the mask. The Hon. [[George Agar Ellis]] reached the conclusion that Mattioli was the state prisoner commonly called The Iron Mask when he reviewed documents extracted from French archives in the 1820s. His book,&lt;ref&gt;George Agar Ellis, The true history of the State Prisoner commonly called the Iron Mask, here identified with Count E. A. Mattioli, extracted from documents in the French archives (London, J. Murray, 1826)&lt;/ref&gt; published in English in 1826, was also translated into French and published in 1830. German historian Wilhelm Broecking came to the same conclusion independently seventy years later.  [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]' ''[[Chambers Book of Days|Book of Days]]'' supports the claim and places Matthioli in the Bastille for the last 13 years of his life. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Since that time, letters sent by Saint-Mars, which earlier historians missed, indicate that Mattioli was only held at Pignerol and Sainte-Marguerite and was not at Exiles or the Bastille and, therefore, it is argued that he can be discounted.&lt;ref name="BBCdocu" /&gt;

==Eustache Dauger de Cavoye==
In his letter to Saint-Mars announcing the imminent arrival of the prisoner who would become the "man in the iron mask," Louvois gave his name as "Eustache Dauger" and historians have found evidence that an Eustache Dauger was living in France at the time and was involved in scandalous and embarrassing events involving people in high places known as [[Affair of the Poisons|l'Affaire des Poisons]]. His full name was Eustache Dauger de Cavoye.&lt;ref name="Noone" /&gt;

Records indicate that he was born on 30 August 1637, the son of François Dauger, a captain in [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s guards. François was married to Marie de Sérignan and they had 11 children, nine of whom survived into adulthood. When François and his two eldest sons were killed in battle, Eustache became the nominal head of the family. Like them, he joined the army, where he came under the command of [[Armand de Gramont, Comte de Guiche]], a brave soldier, notorious playboy and bisexual.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Disgrace===
In April 1659, Eustache and Guiche were invited to an [[Easter weekend]] party at the castle of Roissy-en-Brie. By all accounts it was a debauched affair of merry-making, with the men involved in all sorts of sordid activities, including attacking a man who claimed to be [[Cardinal Mazarin]]'s attorney. It was also claimed,{{By whom|date=July 2010}} among other things, that a [[black mass]] was enacted, and that a pig was [[Baptism|baptized]] as [[carp]] in order to allow them to eat pork on [[Good Friday]]. Other activities, such as [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] sex, may also have taken place.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

When news of these events became public, an enquiry was held and the various perpetrators jailed or exiled. There is no record as to what happened to Dauger, but in 1665, near the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], he allegedly killed a young [[Page (occupation)|page boy]] in a drunken brawl involving the Duc de Foix. The two men claimed that they had been provoked by the boy, who was drunk, but the fact that the killing took place near a castle where the king was staying meant that this was not a good enough explanation and, as a result, Dauger was forced to resign his [[Commissioned officers|commission]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Dauger's mother died shortly afterwards. In her will, written a year previously, she passed over her eldest surviving sons, Eustache and Armand, leaving the bulk of the estate to their younger brother Louis. Eustache was restricted in the amount of money to which he had access, having built up considerable debts, and left with barely enough for "food and upkeep". As titular head of the family, he had come into some small estates, but gave these up to Louis, who provided him with an additional annual payment.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Affair of the Poisons===
{{main|Affair of the Poisons}}
In the 1930s, historian Maurice Duvivier linked Eustache Dauger de Cavoye to the [[Poison affair|Affair of the Poisons]], a notorious scandal of 1677–1682 in which people in high places were accused of being involved in [[black mass]] and poisonings. An investigation had been launched, but Louis XIV had instigated a cover-up when it appeared that his mistress, [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan|Madame de Montespan]] was involved.&lt;ref name="Noone" /&gt;

The records show that during the enquiry the investigators were told about a supplier of poisons, a surgeon named "Auger", and Duvivier became convinced that Dauger de Cavoye, disinherited and short of money, had become Auger, the supplier of poisons, and subsequently Dauger, the man in the mask.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In a letter sent by Louvois to Saint-Mars shortly after Fouquet's death while in prison (with Dauger acting as his valet), the minister adds a note in his own handwriting, asking how Dauger performed certain acts that Saint-Mars had mentioned in a previous correspondence (now lost) and "how he got the drugs necessary to do so". Duvivier suggested that Dauger may have poisoned Fouquet as part of a complex power struggle between Louvois and his rival [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Dauger in prison===
However, evidence has emerged that Dauger de Cavoye actually died in the [[Prison Saint-Lazare]], an asylum run by monks which many families used in order to imprison their "[[black sheep]]". Documents have survived indicating that Dauger de Cavoye was held at Saint-Lazare in Paris at about the same time that Dauger, the man in the mask, was taken into custody in Pignerol, hundreds of miles away in the south.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

These include a letter sent to Dauger de Cavoye's sister, the Marquise de Fabrègues, dated 20 June 1678, which is filled with self-pity as Eustache complains about his treatment in prison, where he has been held for 10 years, and how he was deceived by their brother Louis and Clérac, their brother-in-law and the manager of Louis' estate. A year later, he wrote a letter to the king, outlining the same complaints and making a similar request for freedom. The best the king would do, however, was to send a letter to the head of Saint-Lazare telling him that "M. de Cavoye should have communication with no one at all, not even with his sister, unless in your presence or in the presence of one of the priests of the mission". The letter was signed by the king and Colbert.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A poem written by Louis-Henri de Loménie de Brienne, himself an inmate at the time, indicates that Eustache Dauger de Cavoye died as a result of heavy drinking in the late 1680s. Historians consider all this proof enough that he was not involved in any way with the man in the mask.&lt;ref name="BBCdocu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Noone" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
* [[Alfred de Vigny]], "The Prison" (1821),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Prison_(Vigny) |title=La Prison (Vigny) - Wikisource |language=fr|publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; a long poem describing the final events in the life of the Man in the Iron Mask. An aged priest is called to offer the last rites of the Catholic Church to a mysterious prisoner. After an involved process to ensure the prisoner's anonymity, the priest is introduced to the dying prisoner, who is addressed as "my prince" by the jailer. The priest realizes in the dim light that the prisoner wears an iron mask, and recalls the tales he heard in his youth. The prisoner rejects the priest's efforts, even after the priest promises that his lifelong incarceration has already opened Heaven to him if he would only embrace God. The prisoner dies without relenting. The priest continues to pray for the man for several hours, and is horrified to see that the corpse continues to wear the mask underneath the shroud, denied release even in death.

The '''Munros of Auchinbowie''' (sometimes spelt Monro) are a distinguished branch of the [[Scotland|Scottish]], highland [[Clan Munro]]. From this family three Professors of Anatomy at the [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland were produced, as well as several other doctors and military officers.

==Lineage==
===17th century===
[[File:Monro_RCSEd.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[John Monro (surgeon)|John Monro]] the surgeon of Edinburgh University whose descendants later succeeded to the Auchinbowie property]]
The progenitor of the Munros of Auchinbowie is generally regarded as [[Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts]] who served as a major in an infantry regiment and saw action at the [[Battle of Worcester]] in 1651.  He later took up a career of politics. His ancestry can be traced to [[Munro of Milntown|Andrew Munro, 4th of Milntown]] who descends from [[Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis]] (d.1425), an early chief of the Clan Munro of Ross-shire, Scotland.

Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts had seven children:

#[[George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie]] (1666–1721) who was famed for his victory over the Jacobites at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]] in 1689.  He came into ownership of Auchinbowie, a property about four miles south of [[Stirling]] through his wife Margaret Bruce of Auchinbowie. Later as a Major in Sir Charles Graham's Regiment of Foot he fought at the [[Siege of Namur (1695)]].   
#Archibald Munro born in 1666 and died in 1697.
#[[John Monro (surgeon)|John Monro]] a surgeon at the [[University of Edinburgh]], whose descendants would later succeed to the estates of Auchinbowie.
#Margaret Munro.
#Lillias Munro.
#Jean Munro. Married William, second son of Sir William Sempil of Cathcart.
#Mary Munro.

===18th century===
George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie had three children:
[[File:Auchibowie House.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Auchinbowie House, near [[Stirling]], [[Scotland]]]]
#Alexander Munro, 2nd of Auchinbowie who married Anne, daughter of [[Stewart Baronets|Sir Robert Stewart, Lord Tillicoultry]] in 1719.
#[[George Monro (British Army officer)|George Monro]] (1700–1757) who was a British Army officer famed for his resolute but ultimately unsuccessful defense of [[Fort William Henry]] in 1757 during the [[Seven Years' War]] / [[French and Indian War]] which was made famous by the novel and later the film ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. However, when [[John Alexander Inglis]] wrote his history of the Monro of Auchinbowie family in 1911, he had not at that time identified the younger George Monro as a member of the family.&lt;ref name="Inglis2"&gt;Holden, James A. and Inglis, John Alexander. (1913). ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/42889472?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents The Lineage of Colonel George Monro - Proceedings of the New York State Historical Association]''. '''Volume 13'''. pp. 389 - 403.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Margaret Munro - born 1707.

Alexander Munro, 2nd of Auchinbowie (d.1742)  had nine children: 
#George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie (1721–1793) who was an army surgeon who served in the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd Highlanders]] otherwise known as the ''Black Watch'' under the chief of the Clan Munro; Colonel [[Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet]]. In 1750 George was Surgeon in [[William Maule, 1st Earl Panmure]]'s [[25th Regiment of Foot]]. He saw active service in Germany and afterwards in the war against the French in America. In 1781 he was appointed Physician General to the garrison in [[Menorca]] and went through six months siege by the French and Spanish.
#Alexander Munro, a writer in [[Edinburgh]]. (1724–1750).
#John Munro.
#Cecil Munro. (1719–1786)
#Five other children - all died young.

George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie had two sons:

#Major George Munro who married Elizabeth Aylmer. They had two sons and one daughter.
#[[Hector William Munro|Lieutenant-General Hector William Munro, 1st of Edmondsham]] (d. 1821) was [[List of Governors of Trinidad|Governor of Trinidad]] and who married Philadelphia Bower of [[Edmondsham]]. They had three sons and four daughters.

Although George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie had male heirs as mentioned above, he sold the Auchinbowie property to a cousin, [[Alexander Monro (primus)]] who was the son of [[John Monro (surgeon)]], who was in turn a younger brother of George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie. Alexander Monro (primus) was the founder of the [[Edinburgh Medical School]].  He was appointed lecturer on [[Anatomy]] by the Surgeons' Company at [[Edinburgh]] in 1719; two years later he became professor, and in 1725 was admitted to the [[University of Edinburgh|University]]. He was a principal promoter and early clinical lecturer in the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]. Alexander Monro (primus) had six children:

#[[John Monro (advocate)|John Monro, 5th of Auchinbowie]], advocate, born 5 November 1725 and married Sophia, eldest daughter of Archibald Inglis of Auchindinny. He died in May 1789.
#[[Donald Monro (doctor)|Dr Donald Monro]] (1728–1802), married Dorothea Maria Heineken.
#Jean Monro (1729–1731).
#Mary Monro - born 1730.

Alexander Monro (primus) was succeeded in the property of Auchibowie by his eldest son John Monro, 5th of Auchinbowie who was in turn succeeded by a daughter. However he was succeeded in his profession by his third son [[Alexander Monro (secundus)]] who was Professor of Anatomy in [[Edinburgh]]. He took his degree as Doctor of Medicine on 20 October 1775. He then proceeded to his studies abroad. He spent a short time in [[London]], where he attended the lectures of [[William Hunter (anatomist)|Dr William Hunter]]. He next visited [[Paris]] and on 17 September 1757 entered [[Leiden University]] where he formed a friendship with two famous anatomists, [[Bernhard Siegfried Albinus]] and [[Petrus Camper]]. However his foreign studies were principally prosecuted at [[Berlin]], where he worked under the celebrated Professor Meckel, in whose house he lived. Alexander spent some time in Edinburgh during early 1757 in order to fill the place of his father, who was confined to the house by illness. He finally was admitted a licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] on 2 May 1758 and as a Fellow on 1 May 1759. He had four children:

#Isabella Monro who married Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Cott of Gala. She died in 1801.
#[[Alexander Monro (tertius)]], 2nd of Craiglockhart and Cockburn. (1773–1859).

'''Rebecca Leigh Sandefur''' is an American sociologist who won a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur "Genius" Fellowship]] in 2018 for "promoting a new, evidence-based approach to increasing access to civil justice for low-income communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/1022/|title=Rebecca Sandefur: Sociologist and Legal Scholar|website=[[MacArthur Foundation]]|access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is Associate Professor of Sociology and the Law at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] and a faculty fellow of the [[American Bar Foundation]] (ABF).

== Contributions ==
Sandefur's research focuses on how low-income Americans consume legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Meet-the-Academics-Who-Nabbed/244720|title=Meet the Academics Who Nabbed This Year’s MacArthur ‘Genius’ Grants|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|first=Julian|last=Wylie|date=October 4, 2018|access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' described her research on alternative approaches to settling civil justice disputes over housing, employment, and family issues as the kind of scholarship that can sometimes "pass largely unnoticed by the broader culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-macarthur-genius-grant-winners-1005-story.html|title=Here are 2018's MacArthur 'genius grant' winners, including an Illinois legal scholar|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|first=Steve|last=Johnson|date=October 4, 2018|access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandefur is a faculty fellow of the [[American Bar Foundation]], where she leads a research program on access to justice and contributes to research following the career trajectories of people after they earn their [[Juris Doctor]] degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/american_bar_foundation_faculty_fellow_legal_luminaries_win_macarthur_fello|title=Access-to-justice work earns MacArthur 'genius grant' for American Bar Foundation faculty fellow

Sandefur is also known for her theoretical work on [[social capital]], including her most-cited publication, the 2000 book chapter "A Paradigm for Social Capital" co-written with [[Edward Laumann]], in which she argues that social capital should be understood in terms of benefits that realize people's goals, rather than only as resources to which people have access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Knowledge and Social Capital: Foundations and Applications|editor-last=Lesser|editor-first=Eric L.|chapter=A Paradigm for Social Capital|author1-last=Sandefur|author1-first=Rebecca|author2-last=Laumann|author2-first=Edward O.|date=2000|publisher=Butterworth-Heineman|pages=69-87|isbn=9780750672221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=12073112142456249726|title=Google Scholar Citations: A paradigm for social capital|website=Google Scholar|access-date=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young adult, he spent two years as a [[Mormon missionary]], serving in [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] from 1951 to 1953. Wirthlin was assigned to [[Basel, Switzerland]] for his entire mission.&lt;ref name = ChurchNews-1996-06-15&gt;{{cite news |last= Lloyd |first= R.

==Career in polling firm and politics==
In 1969, Wirthlin founded a survey research firm based in [[Los Angeles]]. Over the years the firm had various names, including ''Decision Making Information, Inc.'', ''The Wirthlin Group'', and finally, ''Wirthlin Worldwide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC1338F93BA15757C0A961948260 |title= Washington Talk: Briefing; Denial from Pollster |newspaper= The New York Times |date= April 28, 1987 |accessdate= 2011-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm was acquired in 2004 by [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]]. After the merger with Harris Interactive, Wirthlin served on its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;''Research Industry Loses a True Giant'', Harris Interactive press release, New York, PR Newswire, March 17, 2011 [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/former-harris-interactive-board-member-dr-richard-b-wirthlin-died-wednesday-march-16-2011-118173134.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, when [[California]] governor [[Ronald Reagan]] decided to run for president, he turned to Wirthlin for political advice. Wirthlin, together with his consulting firm, played a pivotal role in both the 1980 and 1984 elections of Reagan. According to the book ''The Neglected Voter'', Wirthlin was the author of Reagan's historic 1980 campaign plan and foresaw the rise of so-called "Reagan Democrats".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Neglected-Voter-White-Democratic-Dilemma-ebook/dp/B001AW2PKA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438524184&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=neglected+voter+david+kuhn]&lt;/ref&gt; After Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, Wirthlin moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] and continued to assist the president and the [[Republican National Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D71530F93AA35754C0A961948260 |title= Washington talk: Briefing; Wirthlin's Winners |newspaper= The New York Times |date= July 9, 1987 |accessdate= 2011-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work on the first Reagan campaign earned him the title, ''Adman of the Year'', declared by [[Advertising Age]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarp.org/international/reinventingretirement/reinventspeakers/a2004-09-21-rwirthlin.html "Speaker Biography: Richard Wirthlin"].

'''Frances Ruth Coker Burks''' (also known as the '''Cemetery Angel''')&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.newnownext.com/meet-the-cemetery-angel-who-cared-for-dozens-of-forgotten-hivaids-patients/09/2015/ |title = Meet The 'Cemetery Angel' Who Cared For Hundreds of AIDS Patients When No One Else Would |last = Adams |first = Jon |date = September 30, 2015 |work = LOGO News |access-date = June 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former caregiver of [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|AIDS crisis]] victims and an [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] awareness advocate based in [[Arkansas]]. During the onslaught of the AIDS epidemic in the late 1980s, she used her salary as a real estate agent to care for AIDS patients whose families and communities had abandoned them. Because of the prejudices, fears, and stigma surrounding the disease at the time, she was often the patients' only caregiver until they eventually died. She is recognized for burying them in her own family cemetery in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]. She currently lives in [[Rogers, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.arktimes.com/arkansas/ruth-coker-burks-the-cemetery-angel/Content?oid=3602959 |title = Ruth Coker Burks, the Cemetery Angel |last = Koon |first = David |date = January 8, 2015 |website = Arkansas Times  |access-date = June 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born as Frances Ruth Coker Burks after her grandmother,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aumag.org/2017/12/22/ruth-coker-burks-advocate/|title=Ruth Coker Burks: Advocate {{!}} A&amp;U Magazine|last=Needle|first=Chael|website=aumag.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burks was born in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], and was friends with [[Bill Clinton]] growing up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During her childhood, her mother was hospitalized with [[tuberculosis]] for a prolonged period, during which Burks' father was her primary caretaker until his death when she was 5, after which her mother struggled with being Burks' parent. She cites these experiences as formative for her notable empathy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Burks’s family members have been buried in Files Cemetery since the late 19th century. When Burks was a young girl, her mother got into a row with Burks’s uncle. To ensure he and his branch of Burks would be never buried in the same place as the rest of the family, her mother bought every grave space in the cemetery. Those were 262 plots of land in Files Cemetery in Hot Springs. Later Burks' mother left that land to her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As an adult, Burks worked as a [[real estate broker]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gonzagabulletin.com/news/ruth-coker-burks-describes-her-lifetime-caring-for-aids-patients/article_0e5de906-fdeb-11e6-b294-d72df02858f2.html|title=Ruth Coker Burks describes her lifetime caring for AIDS patients to the Gonzaga community|last=Writer|first=Matthew Kincanon {{!}} Staff|work=The Gonzaga Bulletin|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== AIDS advocacy ==
Burks' first interaction with an AIDS patient occurred in 1984, when she was visiting a friend in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02z85xn |title = Fighting fear and stigma to care for Aids patients, Outlook |last =  |first =  |date = August 10, 2015 |work = Outlook |publisher = BBC |access-date = June 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burks' friend had [[cancer]], so Burks spent a lot of time in the hospital.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During one visit, she noticed that [[Nursing|nurses]] were afraid to go into one room covered by a red bag and found out that the patient had what was then known as [[Gay-related immune deficiency|Gay-Related Immune Deficiency]] (GRID).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Burks' cousin was gay, and she had an interest in learning about the disease and was curious about the patient behind the door.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She met the patient, a young man who wanted to see his mother before he died.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To force his mother to hear his wishes, Burke had to threaten the mother with the publication of the man's obituary in their hometown newspaper; even then, the mother called him a "[[sin]]ner" and that she would not see him or claim the body when he died.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Burks then took over his [[palliative care]] and comforted him until his death 13 hours later.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After finding a [[funeral home]] that would take his body, she buried his ashes in her family cemetery.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.fox16.com/news/local-news/i-would-bury-them-in-cookie-jars/609296780 |title = 'I Would Bury Them in Cookie Jars' |date = November 16, 2016 |work = FOX16 |location = Little Rock, AR |publisher = [[KLRT-TV]] |access-date = June 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that first encounter, Burks began to receive phone calls from others who needed her help,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.out.com/positive-voices/2016/5/19/meet-woman-who-cared-hundreds-abandoned-gay-men-dying-aids |title = Meet the Woman Who Cared for Hundreds of Abandoned Gay Men Dying of AIDS |last = Koon |first = David |date = December 1, 2016 |work = Out Magazine |access-date = June 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; caring for over 1,000 people over the 30 or so years she worked with them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.npr.org/2014/12/05/368530521/caring-for-aids-patients-when-no-one-else-would |title = Caring For AIDS Patients, 'When No One Else Would' |author =  NPR Staff |date = December 5, 2014 |work =  Morning Edition |publisher = NPR |access-date = June 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With assistance from her daughter, Burks has buried more than 40 people in her family cemetery in Hot Springs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While her charges were still alive, she helped take them to appointments, obtain medications, apply for assistance, and more.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She also kept supplies of AIDS medications on hand, as some pharmacies would not carry these medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.cracked.com/article_24260_7-mind-blowing-acts-heroism-nobody-talks-about.html |title = 7 Heroes Of History's Darkest Nightmares Who Deserve Movies |last = Iannone |first = Jason |date = August 5, 2016 |website = Cracked.com |access-date = June 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her work with people with AIDS, as she told [[KLRT-TV]], she and her daughter were "outcasts" and crosses were burned in her yard twice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Burks received financial assistance from [[gay bar]]s in Arkansas, including the Discovery Club in Little Rock: "They would twirl up a drag show on Saturday night and here'd come the money. [...] That's how we'd buy medicine, that's how we'd pay rent. If it hadn't been for the drag queens, I don't know what we would have done."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 1988, Norman Jones, owner of the Discovery Club, created Helping People with AIDS, where Burks worked for several years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton's presidency]], Burks was a [[White House]] consultant for AIDS education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Burks' patients lived longer past the national average life expectancy, catching the interest of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and [[National Institutes of Health]]  which sent researchers to investigate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Post-AIDS crisis ==
After medical care and social attitudes towards AIDS improved, she lived and worked in [[Florida]] as a fishing guide and [[funeral director]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2012, Burks suffered a [[stroke]] and had to relearn many skills, including how to talk, read, feed herself and write; she attributes the stress of caring for victims of the AIDS crisis as a plausible influencing factor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The stroke also led to memory loss.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.edgemedianetwork.com/news/aids//212601 |title = Memorial Planned for Ruth Coker Burks, Who Cared for Early Victims of the AIDS Epidemic |last = McCroy |first = Winnie |date = March 26, 2017 |publisher = EDGE Media Network |access-date = June 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, she moved back to [[Rogers, Arkansas]], both in order to be closer to her family and because [[health insurance]] would no longer cover her after her stroke.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 2013, she advocated for three [[Foster care|foster children]] who were removed from school due to rumors that one might be HIV-positive.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After she appeared on TV as an HIV advocate for the children, the community [[Blackballing|blackballed]] her, the funeral home she had previously worked at rescinded her standing job offer, and other businesses refused to hire her, with the local [[Walmart]] allegedly removing a chair she sat in after finding out she did work with HIV advocacy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In August 2016, she was honored at [[New York City]]'s [[Gay pride|Pride Week]] by not-for-profit group Broadway Sings for Pride.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Burks and others are working to create a memorial for victims of AIDS in Hot Springs,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; which would turn the Files Cemetery into a garden that fits its current status as a sort of pilgrimage site for those affected by the crisis.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She has spoken at [[Washington State University]] and [[Gonzaga University]] on her experiences,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and in 2017, [[Rose McGowan]] wrote and directed the short film ''Ruth'' to cover Burks' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kateaurthur/ruth-coker-burks-and-rose-mcgowan|title=An Unsung Hero Of The AIDS Crisis Is Finally Getting The Spotlight|work=BuzzFeed News|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mixed martial arts career==
Safarov started his career with 8 straight victories that included 6 knockouts and 2 submissions. He was then called in for a short replacement fight against [[Gian Villante]]. Gian's original opponent, [[Patrick Cummins (fighter)|Patrick Cummins]], pulled out of the fight with a staph infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/patrick-cummins-withdraws-from-ufc-albany-bout-with-gian-villante|title=Patrick Cummins Withdraws from UFC Albany Bout with Gian Villante - MMAWeekly.com|website=www.mmaweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safarov suffered the first loss of his career by knockout in a back and forth fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2016/12/ufc-fight-night-102-results-gian-villante-tops-saparbek-safarov-in-back-and-forth-brawl|title=UFC Fight Night 102 results: Gian Villante tops Saparbek Safarov in back-and-forth brawl|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Ben Fowlkes|date=2016-12-09|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both participants were awarded ''Fight of the Night'' for their performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/UFC-Fight-Night-102-Bonuses-Villante-Safarov-Ngannou-Meerschaert-All-Pocket-3650K-114835|title=UFC Fight Night 102 bonuses: Villante, Safarov, Ngannou, Meerschaert all pocket $50K|publisher=sherdog.com|author=Mike Sloan|accessdate=2016-12-09|date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safarov was next expected to fight [[Marcos Rogério de Lima]] at [[UFC Fight Night 115]]. However, Lima tested positive for banned anabolic steroids and the bout was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2017/8/11/16137130/marcos-rogerio-de-lima-flagged-for-potential-usada-violation-pulled-from-ufc-fight-night-115|title=De Lima flagged by USADA, pulled from UFC Fight Night 115|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safarov faced [[Tyson Pedro]] on February 11, 2018 at [[UFC 221]]. He lost the fight via kimura submission in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/2/10/17000406/ufc-221-results-tyson-pedro-submits-saparbek-safarov-in-opening-round|title=UFC 221 results: Tyson Pedro submits Saparbek Safarov in opening round|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sattar Khan''' ({{lang-fa|ستارخان}}, {{IPA-fa|sætːɒːɾ xɒn|IPA}}, October 20, 1866 – November 17, 1914), honorarily titled '''Sardār-e Melli''' ({{lang-fa|سردار ملی}} meaning ''National Commander'') was a pivotal figure in the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] and is considered a national hero.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranchamber.com/history/sattarkhan/sattar_khan.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sattar Khan was born in [[Tabriz]], of [[Iranian Azerbaijani]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;Iran and Its Place Among Nations, by Alidad Mafinezam, Aria Mehrabi, 2008, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, Facts on File, Incorporated, 2009 p.78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Turks in World History, by Carter Vaughn Findley - Professor of History Ohio State University, 2004, p.146&lt;/ref&gt; some time in 1868. He was the third son of Haj Hasan Bazzaz, from the [[Arasbārān|Qaradagh]]. During his childhood, his eldest brother, who had become a highway robber, was executed by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sattar-khan-one-of-the-most-popular-heroes-from-tabriz-who-defended-the-town-during-the-lesser-autocracy-in-1908-09&lt;/ref&gt;

The family later moved to [[Tabriz]] where Sattar himself came into conflict with the law when he tried to find a hideout for two Caucasian fugitives to whom his father had given shelter. He was incarcerated for two years in Narin Qalʿa, a notorious local prison. Afterwards he too became a brigand and was subsequently imprisoned again. He also served in the gendarmerie controlling the main road between Khoy and Marand, and for a while found employment as part of the armed escort to the crown prince [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar-al-Din Mirza]] and was given the title of "khan" (which means "sir" in the [[Persian language]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sattar-khan-one-of-the-most-popular-heroes-from-tabriz-who-defended-the-town-during-the-lesser-autocracy-in-1908-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, after a period in Tehran, he headed an auxiliary troop fighting [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] highway robbers near [[Mashhad]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sattar-khan-one-of-the-most-popular-heroes-from-tabriz-who-defended-the-town-during-the-lesser-autocracy-in-1908-09&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary===
Sattar Khan had close ties to the [[Social Democratic Party (Persia)|Social Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Brenda (2003). Borders and Brethren: Iran and the Challenge of Azerbaijani Identity. MIT Press. p. 41. {{ISBN|0-262-19477-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rose from obscurity to head [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutionalist rebels]] from the [[Amirkhiz]] district of [[Tabriz]]. By 1907, he had become a favored leader of the rebels. After shelling the [[Majles]] (parliament) of Iran in the capital [[Tehran]], 40 thousand of [[Mohammad Ali Shah]]'s soldiers were ordered to attack Tabriz, where Constitutional rebels were holding out. In June 1908, under the leadership of Sattar Khan, a High Military Council was established. Sattar Khan was appointed the Commander in chief of High Council, [[Bagher Khan]] as his deputy, and Ali Musyo, Haji Ali and Seyed Hashem Khan as other notable members.

[[File:Sattar khan and Bagir khan.jpg|thumb|Sattar Khan and [[Baqer Khan]]]]

By April 1909, the Tabriz rebels had lost a large number of their fighters in driving out royalist forces from the city. Taking into account Sattar Khan and [[Bagher Khan]]'s heroism during the battle, Sattar Khan was honored by the title of "Sardar-e Melli" ({{lang|fa|سردار ملی}}, "National General") and Bagir khan "Salar-e Melli" ({{lang|fa|سالار ملی}}, "National Leader") by the order of the Assembly.

The early victories of the rebels in Tabriz greatly influenced other Constitutionalists across Iran. Special committees with the name of "Sattar Khan" were established in [[Tehran]], [[Rasht]], [[Qazvin]], [[Isfahan]] and other cities. Sattar Khan's reputation also led to the powerful [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiyari]] tribal leaders to throw in their lot with the Tabriz rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Arash Khazeni, ''Tribes &amp; empire on the margins of nineteenth-century Iran'', University of Washington Press, 2009. (p. 172)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sattar Khan.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait photograph of Sattar Khan with his rifle.]]

Most of the cities of Azarbaijan province were cleared of royalist military forces by October 1908. [[Mohammad Ali Shah]] authorized the reopening of the Majles in Tehran in order to try and placate the opposition.

The Second Majles was held in December 1908. It ordered a plaque of honor with images of Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan carved on it in gold as a token of appreciation for their services.

The strengthening of revolutionary power in the wake of the Tabriz victory frightened not only the [[Qajar]] [[Shah]] but also his allies, Russia and Great Britain. In March 1910, Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan set out for the capital Tehran with 300 pro-[[Moderate Socialists Party|Moderates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|author-link=Ervand Abrahamian|year=1982|title=Iran Between Two Revolutions|isbn=0-691-10134-5|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; soldiers, where they were greeted by large numbers of supporters April 3, 1910.

Sattar Khan and his warrior camped out in [[Atabey Park|Atabek Park]], where they refused to obey the Shah's order to disarm. The Shah's troops and police forces led by [[Yeprem Khan|Yeprem Khan (Davidyans)]], head of Tehran police, launched a brief but violent confrontation on the night of August 7, 1910, and succeeded in surrounding and disarming Sattar Khan's forces. About 30 warriors were killed and Sattar Khan was wounded in his leg – remaining disabled until his death at the age 48, on November 9, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Houri Berberian, ''Armenians and the Iranian constitutional revolution of 1905-1911:
"the love for freedom has no fatherland"'', Westview Press, 2001. (p. 154).&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the famous [[Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine]] cemetery in [[Shahr-e Ray]], just outside Tehran.

==Legacy==
Sattar Khan is remembered in Iran as heroic leader of the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] and is the subject of poems and songs.

===Whistleblower===
Kruszewski is a three-time successful [[whistleblower]], with settlements from suits brought against Southwood Psychiatric Hospital, Pfizer, Inc., and AstraZeneca. Kruszewski became aware of inadequate care and the exploiting of state-committed mentally ill children through overmedication and physical and [[chemical restraint]]s while working for the Department of Public Welfare, Bureau of Program Integrity for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. When he refused to keep silent about his discoveries, he was fired from his position at the state.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan P. Kruszewski v Pfizer Inc., et al. No. 04-1420 (United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt; Kruszewski won settlements for both a First Amendment case against the state of Pennsylvania&lt;ref name="FAsettlement" /&gt; as well as his first Qui tam lawsuit against the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;United States of America ex rel.

He also demonstrated problems with off-label marketing (marketing that promotes uses, patients or doses that are not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]]) which resulted in heightened, but often non-transparent, risk to the health of patients and exceptional costs to taxpayers and state and federal governments.&lt;ref name="Howard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deming"/&gt;

'''''The Twits'''''  is a humorous children's book written by [[Roald Dahl]] and illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]]. It was written in 1979, and first published in 1980. ''The Twits'' was adapted for the stage in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/lancashire/content/articles/2007/11/16/november_twits_feature.shtml "The Twits hit Lancaster!"]. BBC. Retrieved 3 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}
The idea of ''The Twits'' was triggered by Dahl's desire to "do something against beards", because he had an acute hatred  of them. The first sentence of the story is, "What a lot of hairy-faced men there are around nowadays!"

A hideous, vindictive, spiteful couple known as the Twits live together in a brick house without windows (Mr. Twit reasons that this stops people looking in on them, not taking into account that windows are intended to be used for looking ''out'' rather than ''in''). They continuously play nasty practical jokes on each other out of hatred for one another, ranging from Mr. Twit hiding a frog in his wife's bed that he claims is a monster to Mrs. Twit tricking her husband into eating worms in spaghetti. 

They also keep a family of pet monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps. The Twits, who are retired circus trainers, are trying to form the first upside down monkey circus, leaving the monkeys to stand on their heads for hours on end. If they fail to do what Mr. Twit says, Mrs. Twit beats them with her cane.

Mr. Twit also coats tree limbs with [[Birdlime|a strong sticky]] [[glue]] in hopes of catching birds for Mrs. Twit to make into a bird pie. The monkeys try to warn the birds, but since the monkeys speak in an African language, the English birds cannot understand them, so the poor birds wind up boiling in Mrs. Twit's pie. 

One week, the Roly-Poly bird flies in from Africa to visit the monkeys, and acting as an interpreter of languages, keeps the birds from sitting anywhere Mr. Twit has spread glue. Mr. Twit tries several times to catch the birds, spreading the glue on an increasing number of perches, but the Roly-Poly bird changes his warning to reflect the new traps. Tired of chasing the birds, the Twits decide to buy guns to kill them.

The Muggle-Wumps, tired of being forced to stand on their heads, with the help of the birds use Mr. Twit's powerful glue to attach the couple's furniture to their ceiling while they are away to trick them into thinking that they are upside-down and that their ceiling is actually their floor. The birds also smear glue on the Twits' heads, which permanently fixes them to the ground when a panicked Mr. Twit suggests that they stand on their heads so that they are 'the right way up' after they first walk into the upside down living room. 

Stuck on their heads with all their weight pressing down on them, they catch the "Dreaded Shrinks" (a disease that Mr. Twit had convinced Mrs. Twit that she had earlier in the book as one of the aforementioned pranks), their bodies compressing 'downwards' so that they eventually shrink away into nothing, leaving the Muggle-Wumps free to escape.

===Mr. Twit===
Mr. Twit is a wicked person, having hair that covers his entire face, with the exception of his forehead, eyes, and nose. His hair (which he falsely believes makes him appear "wise and grand" but is widely agreed by everyone else makes him look like a twit), is spiky and hard. Because he never washes it, his mustache holds scraps of food stuck there while he ate, including tinned sardines, Stilton cheese, and corn flakes. 

Occasionally, he licks these scraps out and eats them when he is hungry. Instead of wiping his mouth with a cloth, Mr. Twit simply wipes it on his sleeve. Mr. Twit is an alcohol drinker with a fondness for beer, he even drinks at breakfast. He is known to seem very quiet when he is plotting. He and his wife mistreat their monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps. They have kept Muggle-Wump and his family locked up in a cage in the garden.

===Mrs. Twit===
Mrs. Twit is the hideously ugly, menacing wife of Mr. Twit, whose former beauty was distorted as a result of constant horrible thoughts over time. She takes advantage of her [[glass eye]] to play [[practical jokes]] in revenge against her husband, and demonstrates multiple acts of cruelty and viciousness throughout the story; it has been mentioned that the main reason behind her use of a walking cane was as a weapon against innocent children and animals, she participates in the torment of the couple's pet monkeys the Muggle-Wumps, and serves Mr. Twit a lunch of worms disguised as [[spaghetti]]. 

Albeit, while she frequently demonstrates acts of stupidity, she has also exhibited intelligence; she managed to maneuver her way out of a prank that ended with her being carried off into the sky by balloons by chewing through several of the strings and landing safely on the ground. However, aside from this, she is portrayed as being hideous, cruel, and unhygienic.

==The Tricks==
A series of pranks advance the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of the story. Brief descriptions appear below:

===The Glass-Eye===
Mrs. Twit removes her glass eye and drops it in his beer mug while he isn't looking. It isn't until he empties said mug that he sees the eye sitting in there, startling him something awful. Mrs. Twit laughs, gloating that this proves she is always watching him.

===The Frog===
In revenge for the glass eye trick, Mr. Twit places a [[frog]] in Mrs. Twit's [[bed]], and frightens Mrs. Twit by claiming the item in her bed is a 'Giant Skillywiggler', with "teeth like screwdrivers" with which it would bite off her [[toes]]. Mrs. Twit then faints, at which point Mr. Twit splashes a jugful of cold water onto her face. She soon recovers, as the [[frog]] hops onto her [[face]] to get near the [[water]]. 

Mr. Twit then claims the 'Giant Skillywiggler' will soon bite off her nose. Mrs. Twit then flees.

===The Wormy Spaghetti===
Seeking revenge for the Frog Trick, Mrs. Twit places [[worm]]s from the [[garden]] in cooked spaghetti, which Mr. Twit eats, being re-assured by Mrs. Twit that it is merely a new kind called "Squiggly Spaghetti" she has recently bought. When he has eaten it, Mrs. Twit joyfully reveals the truth, to Mr. Twit's horror and disgust.

===The Shrinks===
In revenge for the Wormy Spaghetti, Mr. Twit glues pieces of wood no thicker than a penny onto Mrs. Twit's [[Walking stick|cane]] each night, as well as onto the legs of her [[chair]], making Mrs. Twit believe that she is slowly shrinking. 

Mr. Twit then frightens her by claiming that she has contracted an illness called the 'shrinks', by which she will be caused to disappear. Mr. Twit then claims that to cure the shrinks, Mrs. Twit will have to be "stretched". Mr. Twit then ties Mrs. Twit up in the garden to 60 gas balloons intending to leave her there for a while to teach her a lesson. 

However, once Mrs. Twit makes the mistake of saying that if the strings break, it's goodbye for her, Mr. Twit pretends to tie some more strings to her ankles, before cutting through the strings and sending her skywards. Mrs. Twit eventually returns by biting through several of the balloon strings so she sinks slowly down, eventually collapsing on Mr. Twit in the garden and beating him senseless with her long walking stick immediately afterwards.

===The Sticky Tree===
There is a "Big Dead Tree" in the Twits' [[garden]], which Mr. Twit uses to trap [[bird]]s by spreading Hug-Tight Sticky [[Glue]] on the branches. Captive birds are then made into a [[pie]] by Mrs. Twit. During the story four schoolboys are caught instead of birds; but escape by unfastening their trousers and falling to the ground outside the Twits' garden after Mr. Twit said that he will make boy pie instead of bird pie. It is this use of glue that gives the captive [[monkey]] [[Muggle-Wump]] and his family the idea of using it against the Twits.

===Rescuing the Animals===
Using their friend the Roly-Poly Bird as an interpreter of languages, Muggle-Wump and his wife and children convey the warning that any bird landing on the Big Dead Tree will be cooked into Mrs. Twit's Bird Pie. When Mr. Twit, in retaliation, spreads glue on the monkeys' cage (which serves as a substitute perch), the monkeys alter the warning. The birds end up landing on the Twits' roof. 

This enrages Mr. Twit, who doesn't want to keep waiting for his pie, so the Twits decide to go to the shop and buy a [[gun]] each. During their absence on this errand, Muggle-Wump plots a final trick: to turn the Twits' house upside down. With the help of the birds, Muggle-Wump removes the carpet from the floor, as well as all of the tables, chairs, and other objects in the house, and uses Mr. Twit's glue to stick the objects upside down to the ceiling, leaving the floor absolutely bare. 

By doing this, the Twits will believe that they have been turned upside-down, as they will be standing on what looks like the ceiling of their house, and will stand on their heads to be the right way up. To keep their heads glued to the ground, two birds will put a small amount of glue on the Twits' heads right before they enter the house, so that when they stand on their heads, they will be stuck.

Just as the preparations for this trick are finished, the twits return home. Everything goes as planned, the Twits believed they've been turned upside down and so stand on their heads to counter it, only to be stuck to the bare floor. However, heads are not made to be stood upon. With so much weight on it from above, the Twits literally get 'the shrinks', as was mentioned earlier in the book. However, this time it's not a trick, it's the real thing. After a week or so, the Twits disappear, and everyone who knew of them shouts "hooray!" 

Meanwhile, The Muggle-wumps and Roly-Poly bird escape to their native African land.

==Film==
Since February 2003, a feature film adaptation of the book has been in development by [[Vanguard Animation]] and its founder [[John H. Williams]]. As part of multi picture deal with [[Walt Disney Pictures]], Vanguard was set to produce a CG animated/live action film, with [[John Cleese]] and [[Kirk DeMicco]] writing the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brodesser|first=Claude|title='Twits' pic pleases Cleese|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117880020|accessdate=21 January 2012|newspaper=Variety|date=4 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2004, it was reported that [[Mark Mylod]] signed up to direct the feature, and that Cleese may star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawtrey|first=Adam|title=Bigscreen goes Dahl-crazy|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117913803|accessdate=21 January 2012|newspaper=Variety|date=21 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, after the executive/regime changes at Disney, the project moved to [[Working Title Films|Working Title]] and [[Universal Studios|Universal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawtrey|first=Adam|title=Working Title takes reality check|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117952380|accessdate=21 January 2012|newspaper=Variety|date=22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kirk DeMicco: Monkey Business|url=http://totalscifionline.com/interviews/2236-kirk-demicco-monkey-business|accessdate=21 January 2012|newspaper=Total Sci-Fi Online|date=15 July 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226095434/http://totalscifionline.com/interviews/2236-kirk-demicco-monkey-business|archivedate=26 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2012, the official site of Vanguard Animation stated that [[Conrad Vernon]], the director of ''[[Shrek 2]]'' and ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'', would direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Twits|url=http://www.vanguardanimation.com/images/eleven.jpg|work=Vanguard Animation|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4771">'''Unreported missing''' (also known as '''Missing Missing'''&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;http://hsx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/11/4/319&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Kids off the Grid'''&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outpostforhope.org |title=Outpost For Hope |publisher=Outpost For Hope |date=2012-01-15 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) describes persons who cannot be found, yet have not been or cannot be reported as [[missing persons]] to [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], specifically the [[National Crime Information Center]] database of missing persons in the United States. The term applies whether the missing person is a child or an adult. 

==Explanations==
One reason unreported missing persons may not be formally listed as missing is that those over the [[age of majority]] can be "voluntarily missing." Barring evidence of criminality or being a danger to oneself, [[privacy]] and [[confidentiality]] laws generally protect the rights of those who elect to remain out of contact with family or friends. If an adult unreported missing person is located in such an instance, the police are not obligated to inform the family of the missing person's whereabouts.

According to Outpost For Hope,&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; people can become unreported missing for a variety of reasons, including:

* the lost/missing person may be estranged from family or friends; 
* law enforcement may not take a "missing person" report; 
* the lost/missing person may be in the country illegally;
* the person may be an unknown dependent child of unreported missing adults or teens; or 
* the person might be the victim of an undiscovered crime.

Another example is of children born to homeless or drug addicted mothers. These children are sometimes not registered anywhere and can become victims of crime without any of their other relatives or local agencies knowing. Other children who go missing but are unreported are often runaway [[foster children]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MISSING+KID+CRISIS+DCFS+FINDS+ONLY+A+FEW+RUNAWAYS,+ABDUCTEES-a094623421 |title=Missing Kid Crisis Dcfs Finds Only A Few Runaways, Abductees. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or children who are neglected or whose files are simply cases fumbled by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&amp;pk=MISSING-05-10-05 |title=Scripps Howard News Service |publisher=Shns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone can also become an Unreported Missing person through a victim of an exploitative crime, being involved in human trafficking or prostitution. A study by Professor Kenna Quinet states, "The most successful serial killers know to select the unmissed as victims if they intend to kill for an extended period of time".&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; In her study she refers to serial killers targeting transient people because they are not easily missed, as well as people in institutionalized care.

==Risks==

Being unreported puts a person at a higher risk of exploitation than a person who is reported missing. There are many different outcomes or ways in which a person can be lost or "[[wikt:off the grid|off the grid]]". These outcomes include situations like being mentally ill and lost among the homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Readers Digest Article http://www.rd.com/content/founder-of-outpost-for-hope&lt;/ref&gt; When this happens, a person could very well be [[mentally ill]] or have a drug problem, go into the streets, cannot be reported missing by their family because they have a history of disappearing and then be the victim of murder or [[human trafficking]].  The family never sees them again and even if their body is found, the police have no way of tracking the person to their family as they are not listed in any formal missing database.

==Notable cases==
* [[Death of Barbara Precht|Barbara Precht]], discovered in 2006 and was not identified until late 2014. She was never reported missing by her husband. 
*[[Murder of Anjelica Castillo|Anjelica Castillo]], discovered in 1991 and was not reported missing due to her mother's fears of deportation, as her family were illegal immigrants.
*[[Death of Jason Callahan|Jason Callahan]], discovered in 1995, not reported missing until 2015, as his family did not know what jurisdiction to report his disappearance to and thought he may have gone to live on his own and not wanted contact. 
*[[Murder of Atcel Olmedo|Atcel Olmedo]], discovered in 2005 and was not reported missing because of complications with his abusive stepfather.
*[[Murder of Marcia King|Marcia King]], discovered in 1981 and was not reported missing due to a transient lifestyle.

The experiences of '''women in war''' have been diverse. Historically women have played a major role on the [[home front]]. By the 18th century, some women accompanied armies assigned combat missions, usually handling roles such as cooking and laundry. Nursing became a major role starting in the middle 19th century. The main role in World War I (1914-1918) was employment in munitions factories, farming, and other roles to replace men drafted for the army. Women played an important role in making the system of food rationing work.  World War II (1939-1945) marked a decisive turning point, With millions of women handling important homefront roles, such as working in munitions factories and otherwise replacing drafted men. Volunteer roles expanded. The most romantic new change was millions of women in regular military units. Typically they handled clerical roles so that men could be released for combat. Some women (especially in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Britain) were assigned limited combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units, where they shot down enemy bombers while at the same time being safe from capture.  Underground and resistance movements made extensive use of women in support roles. Reaction set in after 1945, and the roles allowed to women was sharply reduced in all major armies. Restarting in the 1970s, women played an increasing role in the military of major nations, including by 2005 roles as combat pilots. The new combat roles were highly controversial for many reasons including differences in physical capabilities of the sexes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brad Knickerbocker|title=Just three pull-ups: Too many for women in the Marine Corps?|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2014/0104/Just-three-pull-ups-Too-many-for-women-in-the-Marine-Corps|publisher=CS Monitor|date=January 4, 2014|accessdate=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and issues of gender identity for both women and men.&lt;ref&gt;Barton C.
