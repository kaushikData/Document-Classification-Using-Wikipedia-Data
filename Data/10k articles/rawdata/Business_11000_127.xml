      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="905">'''100 Best Workplaces in Europe''' is a ranking of the 100 workplaces in [[Europe]] performed each year by the [[Financial Times]], in partnership with [[Great Place to Work]]. The list is based on [[employee]] surveys and a review of the company's culture. Two thirds of the total score is from employee responses to a 57 question [[Statistical survey|survey]] on the culture of the company. The rest of the score is based on [[demographics]], pay, benefits, [[organizational culture|culture]], and community involvement.

The 2007 survey winner was the car manufacturer [[Ferrari]] of [[Italy]].

Accenture common equity is listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], under the symbol ACN, and was added to the [[S&amp;P 500|S&amp;P 500 index]] on 5 July 2011.

Accenture has five businesses; these are Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology, and Accenture Operations.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years  ===
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm [[Arthur Andersen]]&lt;ref name=WBBM11&gt;{{cite news |title=Accenture To Add 500 Jobs in Chicago |last1= |first1= |url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2011/10/11/accenture-to-add-500-jobs-in-chicago/ |newspaper=[[WBBM-TV]] |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for [[General Electric]] to install a computer at [[Appliance Park]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]],&lt;ref name=Brachear05&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Glickauf Jr. 1912-2005 |last1=Brachear |first1=Manya A. |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-07-28/news/0507280218_1_arthur-andersen-electronic-computer-ham-radio-operator |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=28 July 2005 |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to GE's installation of a [[UNIVAC I]] computer and printer,&lt;ref name=Betts01&gt;{{cite news |title=GE's Appliance Park Still an IT Innovator |last1=Betts |first1=Mitch |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2590401/computer-hardware/ge-s-appliance-park-still-an-it-innovator.html |magazine=[[Computerworld]] |date=29 January 2001 |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Betts90&gt;{{cite news |title=The Univac I: First in the field |last1=Betts |first1=Mitch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7vRlroiLwsC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=the+univac+I:+first+in+the+field&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixt7jAx9TJAhXDHD4KHawvBl4Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20univac%20I%3A%20first%20in%20the%20field&amp;f=false |magazine=[[Computerworld]] |date=2 July 1990 |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Glickauf]], an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division.&lt;ref name=Brachear05/&gt;

===Split from Arthur Andersen===
In 1989, [[Arthur Andersen]] and Andersen Consulting became separate units of [[Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative]] (AWSC). Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and [[Arthur Andersen]]. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into [[escrow]] and issued a claim for breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Mitchell |date=8 August 2000 |title=Arbitrator's Ruling Goes Against Accounting Arm : Consultants Win Battle Of Andersen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/08/business/worldbusiness/08iht-consult.2.t.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergence of Accenture ===
On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is supposedly derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/6509708 Andersen Consulting Changing Name To Accenture – 26 Oct. 2000]; InformationWeek&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AccentureNYSE.jpg|thumb|right|Accenture's banner hanging on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] ([[NYSE]]) building for its initial public offering on 19 July 2001.]]
On 19 July 2001, Accenture's initial public offering ([[initial public offering|IPO]]) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE); [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2001/07/19/deals/accenture/index.htm Accenture IPO gains in first trades – 19 Jul. 2001]; CNN Money&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bermuda headquarters ===
In October 2002, the Congressional [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03194r.pdf Information on Federal Contractors That Are Incorporated Offshore]; United States General Accounting Office; 1 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former [[CNN]] journalist [[Lou Dobbs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dobbs|first=Lou|title=Exporting America|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/09/commentary/dobbs/dobbs/index.htm|accessdate=3 May 2011|publisher=CNN|date=9 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US [[tax avoidance]] ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/delauro/press/2004/accenture_06_01_04.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503215542/http://www.house.gov/delauro/press/2004/accenture_06_01_04.html|date=3 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."&lt;ref name="GAO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Information on Federal Contractors That Are Incorporated  Offshore|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/100/91572.html|website=gao.gov|publisher=General Accounting Office|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accenture engaged in an [[NHS Connecting for Health|IT overhaul project]] for the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.&lt;ref name=nhswithdraw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/sep/28/news.business|title=Accenture to quit NHS technology overhaul|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the [[United Kingdom]] ultimately abandoned the project five years later for the same reasons.&lt;ref name=nhscancel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-pulls-the-plug-on-its-11bn-it-system-2330906.html|title=NHS pulls the plug on its £11bn IT system|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland headquarters ===
Accenture announced on 26 May 2009 that its board of directors unanimously approved changing the company's place of incorporation from [[Bermuda]] to [[Ireland]] and would become '''Accenture plc'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.accenture.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=4830 |title=Accenture Newsroom: Accenture Announces Proposed Change of Incorporation to Ireland |publisher=newsroom.accenture.com |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accenture was chosen to replace [[CGI Group]] as the lead contractor for [[HealthCare.gov]] in January 2014.&lt;ref name=healthgov&gt;{{cite web|title=Accenture chosen as lead contractor of Obamacare website|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/accenture-chosen-lead-contractor-obamacare-website-government-220550193--sector.html|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, Accenture won a $563 million contract to provide ongoing maintenance, software development and technology support for HealthCare.gov through 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/accenture-wins-new-563m-contract-for-healthcare-gov.html Becker's Healthcare]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the United States Department of Defense awarded a major [[Electronic Health Records]] contract to [[Cerner]], [[Leidos]] and Accenture. The contract valued $4.33 billion will serve 55 hospitals and 600 clinics. Accenture Federal Services and Leidos will play the role of configuration specialist, while Cerner is the prime contractor.&lt;ref name=Mukherjee&gt;{{cite web|author=Sy Mukherjee|url=http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cerner-leidos-accenture-win-massive-43b-defense-department-ehr-contra/403130/|
title=Cerner, Leidos, &amp; Accenture win massive $4.3B Defense Department EHR contract|work=Healthcare Dive|date=30 July 2015|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2017, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Inc]]. announced a partnership with Accenture to create [[iOS]] business solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/08/apple-and-accenture-partner-to-create-ios-business-solutions/|title=Apple and Accenture partner to create iOS business solutions|work=Apple Newsroom|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Accenture generated controversy over the amount the firm has been charging to recruit 7,500 [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]] officers. Under the $297 million contract, Accenture had been charging the US Government nearly $40,000 per hire, which is more than the annual salary of the average officer.&lt;ref name=Lanard&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/06/border-patrol-is-so-desperate-for-new-agents-its-spending-millions-to-help-recruits-finish-their-applications-1/ |title= Border Patrol Is So Desperate for New Agents, It’s Spending Millions to Help Recruits Finish Their Applications |author =NOAH LANARD |date=14 June 2018 |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Finances ==

'''Adolph Herman Joseph Coors Jr.''' (January 12, 1884 – June 28, 1970) was an American businessman. He was the son of Louisa (Webber) and brewer [[Adolph Coors]], and the second President of [[Coors Brewing Company]].&lt;ref name=citizen&gt;{{cite book |last=Baum |first=Dan |title=Citizen Coors: An American Dynasty |year=2000 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] | url=https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0756758114 |isbn=0-7567-5811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sara |last=Ivry |title=Citizen Coors |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/23/bib/000423.rv080324.html |quote=Adolph Coors Jr., the son of the brewery's founder, cut ties with one branch of his grandchildren whose father, Adolph's son, was murdered. Another son, Bill, proceeded with plans to give a party the day he learned of his daughter's suicide. Joe, Bill's brother, sometimes called ''the Daddy Warbucks of the Republican Party'', supported Ronald Reagan, the Heritage Foundation and various conservative initiatives, like aid to the Contras. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 23, 2000 |accessdate=2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Coors was a graduate of [[Cornell University]], where he was a member of the [[Sphinx Head Society]] and the Beta Delta chapter of [[Beta Theta Pi]]. He became an accomplished chemist who worked in prominent positions in the family's brewing and [[CoorsTek|porcelain]] operations. He married Alice May Kistler (1885–1970) of [[Denver]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mrs. Adolph Coors Jr. |quote=[[Denver]], November 11, 1970 ([[United Press International]]) Mrs. Adolph Coors Jr. died here last night of a heart attack. She was 85 years old. |work=The New York Times |date=November 12, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; on May 4, 1912, at the Kistler home by Rev. Van Arsdall. The couple had four children: [[Adolph Coors III]] (1915–1960) who was kidnapped and killed in 1960; [[William Coors|William K. Coors]] (1916&amp;ndash;2018), [[Joseph Coors]] (1917–2003), and May Louise Coors (1923–2008).

Coors had his own brush with kidnapping in 1934. Paul Robert Lane, the former state Prohibition agent for Colorado, along with Clyde Culbertson, former investigator for the federal dry forces, along with two other men conspired to kidnap Adolph Jr. for a ransom of $50,000. The person delivering the money was to proceed to three different checkpoints to ensure no officers were tailing him and then split the money; Coors would be released somewhere around [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. Denver police learned of the plot while working on an auto theft ring and Adolph Jr. volunteered to be kidnapped so the police could arrest the suspects. However, Lane was arrested on an auto theft charge and the conspiracy was foiled in advance.

Adolph Coors Jr. died in 1970 at the age of 86 years.

==War Emblem's win in the Preakness==
With his college friend Richard Mulhall as trainer, he got into the racing business initially as Universal Stable.&lt;ref name="horseracing.about.com"&gt;http://horseracing.about.com/library/weekly/aa072302a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 when the operation resurfaced as The Thoroughbred Corporation, with Mulhall retiring as a trainer and taking on the job of racing manager. Mulhall is currently the president of the operation. The pair would go on to racing greatness, both with sales purchases and homebreds. The Thoroughbred Corp.'s roster reads like a who's who of racing in the past decade, with such greats as Sharp Cat, Lear Fan, Jewel Princess, Windsharp, Military, Royal Anthem, Anees, Officer, Habibti, Spain, 2001 Horse of the Year Point Given, and this year's dual classic winner War Emblem.&lt;ref name="horseracing.about.com"/&gt; Currently Thoroughbred Corp. has approximately 60 horses in training mostly stabled with Bob Baffert, D. Wayne Lukas, and John Shireffs, along with 45 broodmares, mostly at Mill Ridge Farm in Lexington. His name will always be associated with War Emblem, his one Kentucky Derby winner, which he quipped was "one of the best investments I ever made in my life, besides buying oil in Saudi Arabia," after he won the Preakness. He bought a 90% share in the colt just three weeks before the Derby, and with the win, became the first Arab owner to capture the Roses.

==Legacy==
[[Faisal bin Salman]] announced in 2004 that Prince Ahmad bin Salman Institute for Applied Media Training would be established to train journalists.&lt;ref name=ar2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Ahmad Institute for Media Training Set Up|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/257427|accessdate=21 May 2012|newspaper=Arab News|date=1 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged involvement in 9/11 attacks==
In ''Why America Slept'' (2003), [[Gerald Posner]] claimed that Ahmed bin Salman (along with Sultan bin Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah and Prince Fahd bin Turki bin Saud al-Kabir) had had ties to [[al-Qaeda]] and had advance knowledge of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. All three died within days of each other, and soon after the [[CIA]] inquired about their possible connection to the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGeary|first=Johanna|title=Confessions of a Terrorist

His friends in American racing stated their knowledge of him and his attitudes made it impossible to believe the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Keeffe|first=Michael|title=War Emblem owner dead but 9-11 rap has life of its own|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2004-05-23/sports/18266386_1_prince-ahmed-prince-faisal-thoroughbred-corp|accessdate=1 May 2012|newspaper=NY Daily News|date=23 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Advanced Cell Technology was formed in 1994 and was led from 2005 to late 2010 by William M. Caldwell IV, [[Chairman]] and [[Chief Executive Officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Executive Profile | url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=399367&amp;ticker=ACTC:US |work= BusinessWeek.com |date= 23 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Mr. Caldwell's death on December 13, 2010, Gary Rabin, a member of ACT's board of directors with experience in investment and capital raising, assumed the role of Chairman and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.advancedcell.com/about-act/leadership-team/senior-executive-officers//| title=Advanced Cell Technology Senior Executive Officers| publisher=Advanced Cell Technology| accessdate=2014-08-13| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720181139/http://www.advancedcell.com/about-act/leadership-team/senior-executive-officers/| archive-date=2014-07-20| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the company's Chief Scientific Officer (CSO), [[Michael D.

The '''Australian Recording Industry Association''' ('''ARIA''') is a [[trade group]] representing the Australian recording industry which was established in 1983 by six major record companies, [[EMI]], [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival]], [[Sony Music|CBS]], [[Bertelsmann Music Group|RCA]], [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] and [[Polygram|Universal]] replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956.&lt;ref name="AARM"&gt;{{cite book|title=The book of Australia : almanac 1997–98|editor=Siobhan O'Connor|page=515|year=1997|origyear=1990|location=[[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain, NSW]]|publisher=Ken Fin: Watermark Press for Social Club Books|isbn=1-875973-71-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It oversees the collection, administration and distribution of music [[license]]s and [[royalties]].

The association has more than 100 members, including small labels typically run by one to five people, medium size organisations and very large companies with international affiliates. ARIA is administered by a Board of Directors comprising senior executives from record companies, both large and small. As of October 2010, the directors were Denis Handlin ([[chairperson|chair]], CEO of Sony Music), George Ash (Universal Music), Mark Poston (EMI), Sebastian Chase (MGM Distribution), David Vodica (Rubber Records/Music) and Tony Harlow (WAR).&lt;ref name="BoD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/more-information.htm|title=Who We Are|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA)|accessdate=28 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101025121748/http://aria.com.au/pages/more-information.htm| archivedate= 25 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1956, the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) was formed by Australia's major record companies.&lt;ref name="AARM"/&gt; It was replaced in 1983 by the Australian Recording Industry Association, which was established by the six major record companies operating in Australia, [[EMI]] (now part of [[Universal Music Group]]), [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]], CBS (now known as [[Sony Music]]), RCA (now part of Sony Music), WEA (now known as [[Warner Music Group]]) and [[Polygram]] (now known as Universal). It later included smaller record companies representing independent acts/labels and has over 100 members. By 1997, the six major labels provided 90% of all recordings made in Australia.&lt;ref name="AARM"/&gt; ARIA is administered by a Board of Directors comprising senior executives from record companies, both large and small.

In February 2004, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) announced its own legal action against [[Kazaa]], alleging massive copyright breaches. The trial began on 29 November 2004. On 6 February 2005, the homes of two Sharman Networks executives and the offices of Sharman Networks in Australia were raided under a court order by ARIA to gather evidence for the trial.

In 2006, ARIA formed sponsorship deals with [[Motorola]] and [[Nova (radio network)|Nova]] and changed the appearance and conduct of the charting. Motorola took naming-rights sponsorship seeing the charts referred to in the media as the Motorola ARIA Charts. ARIA, have commented that as part of the same marketing printed charts would be reintroduced into media retailing shops and their website would be redesigned. As part of the deal Nova began broadcasting the charted singles in reverse order on a Sunday afternoon show before it was released on the ARIA charts website.

==ARIA Charts==
{{main|ARIA Charts}}
The '''ARIA Charts''' is the main Australian music sales charts, issued weekly by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The charts are a record of the highest selling [[Single (music)|singles]] and [[album]]s in various genres. All charts are compiled from data of both physical and digital sales from retailers in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-howare-chartsprepared.htm |title=How are the ARIA Charts prepared each week? |publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association |accessdate=30 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126041502/http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-howare-chartsprepared.htm |archivedate=26 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ARIA Awards==

===ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards===
The '''ARIA No.&amp;nbsp;1 Chart Awards''' were established in 2002 to recognise Australian recording artists, who reached number one on the ARIA albums, singles and music DVDs charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIANo.1ChartAwards1July2005.htm |title=ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards (1 July 2005) |publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association |accessdate=30 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215043454/http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIANo.1ChartAwards1July2005.htm |archivedate=15 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ARIA Music Awards===
{{main|ARIA Music Awards}}
The '''ARIA Music Awards''' is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the [[Music of Australia|Australian music]] industry. The event has been held annually since 1987; it encompasses the general genre-specific and popular awards known as the '''ARIA Awards''', as well as the Fine Arts Awards and Artisan Awards (held separately from 2004), Lifetime Achievement Awards and the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] (held separately from 2005 to 2010 but returned to the general ceremony in 2011).

==Criticisms==
Like most recording industry associations, ARIA has been criticised for fighting [[copyright infringement]] matters aggressively, although in Australia this has largely taken the form of aggressive advertising campaigns particularly in cinemas directly preceding movies. This criticism is stauncher in Australia due to the absence of an equivalent [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] or state crimes acts which clearly establish copyright infringement as a crime.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
&lt;!-- This is not entirely correct, as Australia does have an amendment act to the copyright act which covers digital intellectual property, someone with exact knowledge of this should add information regarding it --&gt;

In February 2004, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) took legal action against [[Kazaa]], alleging massive copyright breaches. The trial began on 29 November 2004. On 6 February 2005, the homes of two [[Sharman Networks]] executives and the offices of Sharman Networks in Australia were raided under a court order by ARIA to gather evidence for the trial.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The ARIA charts have also been criticised as an easily manipulated market tool abused by aggressively marketed pop acts. "Gold" and "Platinum" ARIA awards are based on units shipped to retail outlets, not on how many of those units are sold to customers. A lukewarm album or single release can achieve Gold or Platinum status by flooding the market with copies, and if 99% are returned to the manufacturer that in no way affects the status of the award.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

ARIA has been criticised by former ''[[Australian Idol]]'' judge and record producer [[Ian Dickson (music mogul)|Ian Dickson]] for a perceived intolerance of ''Australian Idol'' contestants, and a lack of nomination in the [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Bernard | last=Zuel | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/will-idol-graduates-ever-get-any-respect/2007/09/05/1188783289280.html?page=fullpage | title=Scarlet letters | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=2007-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Autographic Register''' is a business machine invented in 1883 by James C. Shoup.  The device consisted two separate rolls of paper interleaved with [[carbon paper]]. Usually one or both of the rolls would be preprinted with form information. To operate the machine the user would write, for example, a sales receipt and the machine automatically produced a copy. The crank on the machine ejected the records and moved a blank form into view.  The original receipt produced would go to the user and the copy was filed.&lt;ref name=BusRef&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Register Co.|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/4/Standard-Register-Co.html|website=Reference for Business|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoup founded the Autographic Register Company in [[Hoboken, NJ]] to manufacture his invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoboken.pastperfectonline.com/bysearchterm?keyword=Autographic+Register+Company|website=Hoboken Historical Museum Online Collections Database|title=Autographic Register Company|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Autographic Register was an advance over use of separate forms and carbon paper as it guaranteed that the copy was made and kept the forms in relative alignment. A number of advancements were soon made, including the use of sprocket-fed paper, invented by Theodore Schirmer. This helped avoid slippage and misalignment of forms, allowing more copies to be produced simultaneously. In 1912 Schirmer founded the [[Standard Register Industrial|Standard Register Company]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Standard Register|title=100 Years of Innovation|url=http://media.standardregister.com/standard-register/docs/company/Centennial-Whitepaper.pdf|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of sprocket-fed paper later found use in computer printers.

Although the Autographic Register has been largely replaced by newer technology it remains in use as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portable Register - Plastic Register for 4 x 6 Forms|url=https://www.deluxe.com/shopdeluxe/pd/portable-register-plastic-register-for-4-x-6-forms/_/A-D924|website=Deluxe Enterprise Operations|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''capacity''' of [[natural person|natural]]  and [[juridical person|juridical]] persons ([[legal person]]s) in general, determines whether they may make binding amendments to their [[rights]], [[duty|duties]] and [[obligation]]s, such as getting [[marriage|married]] or [[Mergers and acquisitions|merging]], entering into [[contract]]s, making [[gift (law)|gifts]], or writing a valid [[will (law)|will]]. Capacity is an aspect of [[status (law)|status]] and both are defined by a person's ''personal law'':
*for natural persons, the law of [[domicile (law)|domicile]] or ''[[lex domicilii]]'' in [[common law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, and either the law of [[nationality]] or ''[[lex patriae]]'', or of [[habitual residence]] in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] states;
*for juridical persons, the law of the place of [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]], the ''[[lex incorporationis]]'' for [[company (law)|companies]] while other forms of business entity derive their capacity either from the law of the place in which they were formed or the laws of the states in which they establish a presence for trading purposes depending on the nature of the entity and the transactions entered into.
When the [[law]] limits or bars a person from engaging in specified activities, any [[Contract|agreements]] or [[contract]]s to do so are either [[Voidable contract|voidable]] or [[Void contract|void]] for '''incapacity'''.  Sometimes such legal incapacity is referred to as ''incompetence''.  For comparison, see [[Competence (law)]].

==Discussion==
As an aspect of the [[social contract]] between a state and its [[citizen]]s, the state adopts a role of protector to the weaker and more vulnerable members of society. In [[public policy (law)|public policy]] terms, this is the policy of ''[[parens patriae]]''. Similarly, the state has a direct social and economic interest in promoting trade, so it will define the forms of business enterprise that may operate within its territory, and lay down rules that will allow both the businesses and those that wish to contract with them a fair opportunity to gain value. This system worked well until social and commercial mobility increased. Now persons routinely trade and travel across state boundaries (both physically and electronically), so the need is to provide stability across state lines given that laws differ from one state to the next. Thus, once defined by the personal law, persons take their capacity with them like a passport whether or however they may travel. In this way, a person will not gain or lose capacity depending on the accident of the local laws, e.g. if A does not have capacity to marry her cousin under her personal law (a rule of [[consanguinity]]), she cannot [[evasion (law)|evade]] that law by travelling to a state that does permit such a marriage (see [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]]). In Saskatchewan Canada, an exception to this law allows married persons to become the common law spouse of other(s) prior to divorcing the first spouse. This law is not honored amongst other Canadian provinces.

===Natural persons===
{{see also|Testamentary capacity}}
Standardized classes of person have had their freedom restricted. These limitations are exceptions to the general policy of [[freedom of contract]] and the detailed [[human rights|human]] and [[civil rights]] that a person of ordinary capacity might enjoy. Hence, for example, freedom of movement may be modified, the [[right to vote]] may be withdrawn, etc. As societies have developed more equal treatment based on gender, race and ethnicity, many of the older incapacities have been removed. For example, [[English law]] used to treat married women as lacking the capacity to own property or act independently of their husbands (the last of these rules was repealed by the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973, which removed the wife's domicile of dependency for those marrying after 1974, so that a husband and wife could have different domiciles).

====Minor (law)====
{{main article|Minor (law)}}

The definition of an ''infant'' or ''minor'' varies, each state reflecting local [[culture]] and [[prejudice]]s in defining the [[age of majority]], [[marriageable age]], [[voting age]], etc. In many [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, legal [[contract]]s, in which (at least) one of the contracting parties is a minor, are voidable by the minor.  For a minor to undergo [[medical procedure]], [[consent]] is determined by the minor's parent(s) or [[legal guardian]](s).  The right to vote in the United States is currently set at 18 years, while the right to buy and consume [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is often set at 21 years by U.S. [[state law]].  Some laws, such as marriage laws, may differentiate between the sexes and allow women to marry younger. There are instances in which a person may be able to gain capacity earlier than the prescribed time through a process of [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]]. Conversely, many states allow the inexperience of childhood to be an excusing condition to criminal liability and set the [[age of criminal responsibility]] to match the local experience of emerging behavioral problems (see ''[[doli incapax]]''). For sexual crimes, the [[age of consent]] determines the potential liability of [[adult]] accused.

As an example of liability in contract, the law in most of Canada provides that an infant is not bound by the contracts he or she enters into except for the purchase of necessaries and for beneficial contracts of service. Infants must pay fair price only for necessary goods and services. However, the [[British Columbia]] ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040617060433/http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/I/96223_01.htm Infants Act]'' (RSBC 1996 c.223) declares all contracts, including necessities and beneficial contracts of service, are unenforceable against an infant. Only student loans and other contracts made specifically enforceable by statute will be binding on infants in that province.

In contracts between an adult and an infant, adults are bound but infants may escape contracts at their option (i.e. the contract is voidable). Infants may ratify a contract on reaching age of majority. In the case of executed contracts, when the infant has obtained some benefit under the contract, he/she cannot avoid obligations unless what was obtained was of no value. Upon repudiation of a contract, either party can apply to the court. The court may order restitution, damages, or discharge the contract. All contracts involving the transfer of real estate are considered valid until ruled otherwise.

====Minors and Contractual Capacity====
A [[Minor (law)|minor]] (typically under 18) can disaffirm a contract made, no matter the case. However, the entire contract must be disaffirmed. Depending on the jurisdiction, the minor may be required to return any of the goods still in his possession. Also, [[barter]] transactions such as purchasing a [[retail]] item in exchange for a cash payment are generally recognized through a [[legal fiction]] not to be contracts due to the absence of promises of future action.  A minor may not disavow such a trade.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy E. &lt;u&gt;[http://www.randybarnett.com/aconsent.htm A Consent Theory of Contracts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925033415/http://www.randybarnett.com/aconsent.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/u&gt; Columbia Law Review (March, 1986) pp. 299, fn 123&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Disaffirmance''' - it  must be timely. For example, a contract that goes beyond two years of reaching the age of majority would be considered ratified. Minors are still allowed to disaffirm, even if their age is misrepresented. They will not face tort violations. Some states don't allow disaffirmance if the consideration cannot be returned.
*'''Obligations''' - most states hold that a minor only must return the goods (consideration) if the goods are still in the minor’s possession. Many states are requiring that the minor restore the adult (other party) to the state they were in before the contract was made. Minors are beginning to be held responsible for damages, wear, tear, etc. of the good in question upon return. A suit for tort is considered by some states to be an enforcement of the contract and is not allowed.
*'''Liability''' - for necessities, (1) the item contracted for must be necessary for minor’s existence, (2) the value must be up to that of the current standard of living or financial/social status (not excessive in value), (3) the minor must not be under the care of a parent/guardian who is required to supply the item. A minor could be held liable for a contract for the purchase of luxury items (those that are not in the financial/social/standard of living range).
*'''Ratification''' - accepting and giving legal force to an obligation. Express ratification (for a minor) is expressly stating, orally or in writing that he/she intends to be bound by the contract. Implied ratification is when the conduct of the minor is inconsistent with that of disaffirmance or when minor fails to disaffirm an executed contract within a reasonable period.
Generally, the courts base their determination on whether the minor, after reaching the age of majority, has had ample opportunity to consider the nature of the contractual obligations he or she entered into as a minor and the extent to which the adult party to the contract has performed.&lt;ref&gt;Jentz, Gaylord A. and Roger LeRoy Miller &lt;u&gt;Business Law Today: The Essentials&lt;/u&gt; South-Western College/West, Ohio, 2003 pp. 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;
As one court put it, "the purpose of the infancy doctrine is to protect 'minors from foolishly squandering their wealth through improvident contracts with crafty adults who would take advantage of them in the marketplace.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Hauer v. Union State Bank of Wautoma'', 192 Wis. 2d 576, 593 (1995), quoting ''Halbman v. Lemke'', 99 Wis. 2d 241, 245 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insanity, mental illness, or mental/medical condition====
{{See also|Insanity|mental disorder}}
Individuals may have an inherent physical condition which prevents them from achieving the normal levels of performance expected from persons of comparable age, or their inability to match current levels of performance may be caused by contracting an illness. Whatever the cause, if the resulting condition is such that individuals cannot care for themselves, or may act in ways that are against their interests, those persons are vulnerable through dependency and require the protection of the state against the risks of abuse or exploitation. Hence, any agreements that were made are voidable, and a court may declare that person a ward of the state and grant [[power of attorney]] to an appointed [[legal guardian]].

In England and Wales, this is a specific function of the [[Court of protection|Court of Protection]], and all matters concerning persons who have lost, or expect soon to lose, mental capacity are regulated under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. This makes provision for [[Lasting power of attorney|lasting powers of attorney]] under which decisions about the health, welfare and financial assets of a person who has lost capacity may be dealt with in that person's interests.

In Ireland the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was passed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|last=(eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie|language=en|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act addresses the capacity of people with intellectual disabilities. The general principles are set out in section 8 of the Act.

This sort of problem sometimes arises when people suffer some form of medical problem such as unconsciousness, [[coma]], extensive [[paralysis]], or delirious states, from accidents or illnesses such as [[stroke]]s, or often when older people become afflicted with some form of medical/mental [[disability]] such as [[Huntington's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Lewy body]] disease, or similar dementia.  Such persons are often unable to consent to medical treatment and otherwise handle their financial and other personal matters.  If the afflicted person has prepared documents beforehand about what to do in such cases, often in a revocable living [[Trust law|trust]] or related documents, then the named legal guardian may be able to take over their financial and other affairs.  If the afflicted person owns his/her property jointly with a spouse or other able person, the able person may be able to take over many of the routine financial affairs.  Otherwise, it is often necessary to petition a court, such as a [[probate court]], that the afflicted person lacks legal capacity and allow a legal guardian to take over their financial and personal affairs.  Procedures and court review have been established, dependent on the area of jurisdiction, to prevent exploitation of the incapacitated person by the guardian.  The guardian periodically provides a financial accounting for court review.

In the [[Criminal Law]], the traditional common law [[M'Naghten Rules]] [[excuse]]d all persons from liability if they did not understand what they were doing or, if they did, that they did not know it was wrong. The consequences of this excuse were that those accused were detained indefinitely or until the medical authorities certified that it was safe to release them back into the community. This consequence was felt to be too draconian and so statutes have introduced new defenses that will limit or reduce the liability of those accused of committing offenses if they were suffering from a mental illness at the relevant time (see the [[insanity defense|insanity]] and [[mental disorder defense|mental disorder]] defenses).

====Drunkenness or drug abuse====
Although individuals may have consumed a sufficient quantity of intoxicant or drug to reduce or eliminate their ability to understand exactly what they are doing, such conditions are self-induced and so the law does not generally allow any defense or excuse to be raised to any actions taken while incapacitated. The most generous states do permit individuals to repudiate agreements as soon as sober, but the conditions to exercising this right are strict.

====Bankruptcy====
{{See also|Bankruptcy}}
If individuals find themselves in a situation where they can no longer pay their debts, they lose their status as credit-worthy and become bankrupt. States differ on the means whereby their outstanding liabilities can be treated as discharged and on the precise extent of the limits that are placed on their capacities during this time but, after discharge, they are returned to full capacity. In the United States, some [[U.S. state|states]] have spendthrift laws under which an irresponsible spender may be deemed to lack capacity to enter into contracts (in Europe, these are termed prodigality laws) and both sets of laws may be denied extraterritorial effect under public policy as imposing a potentially penal status on the individuals affected.

====Enemy aliens and/or terrorists====
During times of war or civil strife, a state will limit the ability of its citizens to offer help or assistance in any form to those who are acting against the interests of the state. Hence, all commercial and other contracts with the "enemy", including terrorists, would be considered void or suspended until a cessation of hostilities is agreed.

===Business entities===
*[[Corporations]]
The extent of an artificial person's capacity depends on the law of the place of incorporation and the enabling provisions included in the [[constitutional documents|constitutive documents]] of incorporation. The general rule is that anything not included in the corporation's capacity, whether expressly or by implication, is ''[[ultra vires]]'', i.e. "beyond the power" of the corporation, and so may be unenforceable by the corporation, but the rights and interests of innocent third parties dealing with the corporations are usually protected.
*General and limited partnerships
There is a clear division between the approach of states to the definition of partnerships. One group of states treats [[general partnership|general]] and [[limited partnership|limited]] partnerships as aggregate. In terms of capacity, this means that they are no more than the sum of the natural persons who conduct the business. The other group of states allows partnerships to have a separate legal personality which changes the capacity of the "firm" and those who conduct its business and makes such partnerships more like corporations.
*Unions
In some states, [[trade union]]s have limited capacity unless any contract made relates to union activities.
*[[Insolvency]]
When a business entity becomes insolvent, an [[Administrator (law)|administrator]], receiver, or other similar legal functionary may be appointed to determine whether the entity shall continue to trade or be sold so that the creditors may receive all or a proportion of the money owing to them. During this time, the capacity of the entity is limited so that its liabilities are not increased unreasonably and to the detriment of the existing creditors.

Cemented carbide as a tool material has been increasingly used for cutting tools, wear-resistant tools, impact-resistant tools, and other products with special purpose. Cemented carbide was first used in stretching mold area and has gone through cast iron mold, alloy steel mold, diamond dies, cemented carbide dies, polycrystalline module die and other developmental stages.  With the property of high wear resistance, good polishing performance, low friction coefficient, etc., cemented carbide drawing die has been a substitute of steel mold which is used to stretching steel and non-ferrous metal.

==Developmental history==
Cemented carbide was first invented by Bavarians to make wire drawing dies. In other words, wire drawing die is the direct incentive of the appearance of cemented carbide.

In 1950s, cemented carbide industry grew up in [[China]]. Since then, cemented carbide drawing die has been gradually gaining popularity in China. Currently, WC-Co cemented carbide is widely used in [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Sweden]], [[Italy]], etc. In some other counties, rare metal carbides (such as TiC, TaC, NBC, etc.) are added into cemented carbide drawing dies and its manufacturing process is also certainly different.

In China, the Cobalt content in cemented carbide drawing die is basically the same as that in the Soviet Union. The traditional grade for cemented carbide drawing dies in China is almost YG8, rarely YG15 and YG6X. Later, in order to obtain better wearing resistance, the Cobalt content has to be decreased. While with the decreasing of the [[Cobalt]] content, the impact toughness and flexural strength of the cemented carbide drawing die will dramatically decline. In recent years, the Cobalt content adopted in cemented carbide drawing die area in China is the same as that in Sweden Sandvik Umparg which is the leader of cemented carbide industry in the world. At the same time, researchers are trying to improve the performance of cemented carbide by adding rare metal carbides. For example, researchers in Tianjin Cemented Carbide Research Institute add 1% TaC into cemented carbide drawing dies to inhibit grain growth and refine grain size in the sintering process. In result, the service life of this kind of drawing dies is greatly longer than the general grade YG8. In Shanghai Material Factory, the Cobalt content is declined to 6% and a few TaC are added into cemented carbide drawing dies in the sintering process so that the production volume is two times of that of general grade when stretching A3 steel, YIF steel, copper, etc.

==Structure==

#Entrance area: the region from the entrance area to the working area is generally circular arc which plays a transition role in facilitating drawing materials into the working area so that the materials would not be scratched by the shuttle edge of the hole.
#Lubrication area: its role is to store lubricant which is conducive to lubricate drawing materials so that the drawing process can be completed successfully.
#Working area: Working area is the plastically deforming area for drawing materials. Length and cone angle are the two factors for the working performance of this area. If the working area is too short, excessive pressure to the working area will be generated by the metal stretched. For the above reason, the tensile stress increased significantly, resulting in the accelerated wear of the mold. The principles for the selection of the length of the working area are as follows: a. The working area used for stretching soft metal wire is shorter than the working area used for stretching hard metal wire; b. The working area used for stretching metal wire with small diameter is shorter than the working area used for stretching metal wire with a large diameter; c.The working area worked under the condition of wet lubrication is shorter than the working area worked under the condition of dry lubrication. As for the taper angle, the taper angle is smaller when stretching steel, while the cone angle should be larger when stretching non-ferrous metals and its alloys.
#Sizing area: the final dimension of the drawing material is determined after passing the sizing area. The length of the sizing area is different according to the different hardness, sectional area and lubrication situation of the drawing material. If the sizing area is too long, the friction will be increased in the stretching process and the mould temperature will be elevated which will influence the service life of the mould, at the same time, the tensile stress will be increased so the breaking rate of the metal wire will rise. If the sizing area is too short, the change of cone angle will influence the size of the material.
#Exit area and exit cone angle: exit area is the last part passed by the drawing material whose function is to protect the sizing area from cracking. Exit cone angle is to protect the quality of the completed metal wire. The exit area should not be too short; otherwise, the outlet end of the mold is easily broken. When manufacturing the mold, the sharp edge connecting the exit area and sizing area should be rubbed into circular arc to avoid the abrasion of the metal wire.

==Precautions for use==
*Selecting the suitable mould for the material to be stretched or the mould will be cracked.
*The mould should be tightened properly at the stretched direction to prevent uneven wear.
*Lubricant is important to the service life of the mould. The user should select suitable lubricant and keep the mould using in a clean environment.
*The mould should not be knocked or cast casually.

'''Design leadership''' is a concept complementary to [[design management]]. In practice, design managers within companies often operate in the field of design leadership and design leaders in the field of design management. However, the two terms are not interchangeable, they are interdependent. {{ref|TR|1|}} In essence, and at the highest level, design leadership helps to define the future and design management provides key tools for getting there. Both are critically important to business, government and society, and both are necessary in order to maximise value from design activity and investment.

Design leadership can be described as leadership that generates innovative design solutions. Turner{{ref|TR|1|}} defines design leadership by adding three additional aspects for design leadership,
*the difference in leading through design,
*the sustaining design leadership over time and
*the gaining of acknowledgment for achievements through design.

Turner{{ref label|TR|1|a}} separates the core responsibilities of design leadership in following six activities:
*envisionising of the future
*manifesting strategic intent
*directing design investment
*managing corporate reputation
*creating and nurturing an environment of [[innovation]]
*training for design leadership

An '''elevator consultant''' is someone who specializes in the design, testing and maintenance inspection of [[elevator]]s, [[escalator]]s, [[moving walkway]]s and many other conveyances that move people. They are not to be confused with [[elevator mechanic]]s. Consultants (unlike mechanics) do not normally perform work on conveyances. Some elevator consultants may also work as private [[elevator inspector]]s. Some jurisdictions may accept independent third party inspectors for certified inspections while others may employ their own inspectors.

==Job duties==
Elevator consultants work for property owners, developers, building tenants, [[architect]]s, [[engineer]]s, municipal code enforcement bodies and insurance companies for the following purposes:
*Identifying elevator system options for Developers in order to create the most efficient transportation solution for a specific building.
*Designing elevator systems for Architects and Engineers, including elevator bank traffic studies, component specifications, and providing blueprint drawings for incorporation into contract bid packages.
*Performing ASME A17.1 QEI-1 certified inspections under the authority of the [[Municipal Code Enforcement Official]]s (in the USA).
*Providing maintenance audits to verify contract compliance with the maintenance provisions of the contract, confirming compliance with the ASME A17.1 maintenance provisions, and determining the long term viability of the equipment as required by the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) maintenance requirements.
* Enforcing Municipal code upon conveyances, ensuring the public's safety, although these inspections are frequently performed by elevator inspectors employed by or authorized by public entities.
*Expert testimony for lawsuits involving conveyances.

Elevator Consultants can be a helpful resource to those who are involved in the design of new buildings and the management of existing buildings. An Elevator Consultant will typically not perform work on a conveyance in order to ensure their independence. In some instances, they may be authorized to address serious hazards as part of their ethical responsibility to the public by removing a conveyance from service, until potential dangers can be addressed.

==Education background==
There are no specific university programs to train an Elevator Consultant, although many are trained in [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[electrical engineering]]. Many Elevator consultants are former employees of major manufacturers, but may have limited technical background in the design and construction of buildings. Elevator consultants most frequently gain skills through experience in a variety of conveyance-related work. A qualified Elevator Consultant should have specific experience in elevator construction and modernization, familiarity with model codes and standards, and familiarity with local building codes, laws and regulations. Some elevator consultants may also perform certified inspections, after qualifying and obtaining QEI-1 credentials in the States or [[Provinces]] where independent inspectors are authorized. (see [[elevator inspector]])

Although some elevator consultants may be certified as QEI Inspectors, verifying qualifications of a consultant can be difficult. One organization called the [[International Association of Elevator Consultants]], (IAEC) sets standards for experience and certification of independence, in order to become a member, which is intended to minimize concerns with the consultant's qualifications.

IAEC has recently made available a special certification, the Qualified Elevator Consultant, (QEC). There are currently 10 QECs in the world. Included in this list are representatives from the USA, Canada, and India. Requirements for attaining QEC certification are found in the IAEC bylaws and include, among other things, ten years of verifiable elevator consulting experience and extensive industry involvement.

Some elevator manufacturers may also employ trained staff in technical sales and support engineering departments to assist in the design of elevator and escalator systems. Elevator consultants however, are generally employed as independent contractors by architects, engineers or directly by property owners for large scale building projects involving multiple technical disciplines. A design team for a major building project will often require a specific technical design experience by professional consultants, such as a [[kitchen consultant]], [[lighting consultant]], [[audio-visual consultant]], [[landscape architect]], and/or am elevator consultant to supplement the technical work of the architect and engineer. It is expected by the Owner that these design teams will avoid using consultants that represent a specific manufacturer to minimize the potential, or even the appearance of a conflict of interest.

The demands of the [[real estate]] business have promoted the growth of the elevator consulting field, largely because one of the most expensive parts of the elevator is the space taken in the building. Careful design of the elevator system can both minimize the cost of elevators and improve the efficiency of the building. Elevators and escalators can add a substantial initial and long term investment to a building. A qualified independent elevator consultant is common in large campus type environments such as colleges, hotel chains and malls where standardization of materials and methods is desirable.

==Elevator inspector==
In general, elevator and escalator inspectors in the US and Canada are required to carry a current Qualified Elevator Inspector's (QEI) certification. In some jurisdictions, equivalent certification may be offered through State or Provincial authorities; however the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) requires QEI certification as the sole standard for proof of qualification (See: ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators). Increasingly, US States are using authorized independent inspectors to perform periodic inspections, witnessing annual tests that in the past would have been the work of State employees. In many States, a list of qualified competitive inspection companies are made available to private property owners to select from.

QEI Certification is available from one of three organizations approved by the ASME. Qualification to obtain QEI certification includes extensive previous experience in the field of elevators (and other conveyances), experience working as an inspector and passing a comprehensive written examination. An application is available from the [[National Association of Elevator Safety Authorities]], maintaining current certification that includes meeting standards for continuing education, required to be renewed annually. The qualifications for QEI Inspectors and QEIS (inspector supervisors) and Certifying Organizations and performance standards for inspectors can be found in the ASME standard QEI-1 Standard for the Qualification of Elevators and Inspectors. Inspectors are required by the ASME standards to avoid situations that are considered unethical, such as conflicts of interest that include performing or witnessing inspections and test on conveyances that they or their employer have financial interest in. Inspections are performed using the ASME A17.2 Guide for Inspection of Elevators, Escalators and Moving Walks as well as other relevant reference standards and local building codes. In most cases, inspectors are required to verify that conveyances meet the standards that they were originally installed under, however some jurisdictions may require conveyances that meet more current standards, including US federal authorities that often require conveyances meeting the minimum standards of the ASME A17.3 Safety Code for Existing Elevators and Escalators. Additionally, all conveyances are required to meet current safety standards for maintenance and inspection regardless of the date of original installation.

ASME A17.1 Appendix N lists the recommended frequency for conveyance inspections and tests. Each Authority Having Jurisdiction has authority to determine the frequency for inspection in their jurisdiction. However, the [[International Code Council]], the most commonly adopted national standard for building codes in the US, adopts the recommended frequency of Appendix N in its entirety. In general, a QEI certified elevator inspector is required to perform a periodic inspection on passenger and freight elevators and escalators every six months. Additionally, each conveyance is required to have a series of safety tests completed annually by qualified elevator maintenance personnel (as defined by ASME A17.1). This test is required to be witnessed by a QEI inspector that does not have a personal financial interest in, or be employed by someone that has a financial interest in the results of the test. (This would be considered an unethical conflict of interest) In summary, most elevators, escalators, [[platform lift]]s and other conveyances that are permitted to carry people, are required to have two periodic inspections and one annual test each year. Additionally, all new and renovated elevators require an acceptance inspection and test to verify that any new or substantially modernized equipment conforms to the latest codes and standards.

Elevator Inspection Companies are Independent Contractors that are required to be authorized by the local, State or national authority having jurisdiction. (According to ASME A17.1) Standards for being approved for authorization generally include verification of independence, current certification and appropriate [[liability insurance]]. In most Jurisdictions that use independent inspectors, the authority having jurisdiction authorizes multiple inspection companies to avoid concerns with anti-trust lawsuits (see: Professional Ambulance Service, Inc. v. Abramowitz, 328 N.Y.S.2d 467). To protect the interests of the public, authorities are responsible to verify that an inspection company maintains current QEI certification for inspectors (as applicable), provides proper safety equipment to employees, carrying general liability, errors and omissions insurance prior to authorization.

Violations of elevator, escalator and other conveyance safety codes may involve civil damages to property owners, and may include liability claims if those violations include personal injuries. Property Owners may incur additional liability, including civil and criminal penalties if it can be proven that they failed to properly maintain and/or meet the State or Provincial requirements for inspections of their conveyances, particularly if those claims are made that indicate negligence.

Verification by Users of Conveyances of proof of current inspection is generally the right of the public. Certification processes vary widely across jurisdictions, but in general, the riding public has a right to demand proof that a conveyance available to the public has met the Jurisdiction's standards for current inspections. In States enforcing the ICC International Property Maintenance Code, that right is explicitly stated in section 606.1. Recent attempts to make those certifications more easily accessible to the public were blocked by building owner associations, however the property maintenance code is unambiguous about the right of the riding public to verify current certifications are maintained.

'''Farzad Nazem''' ({{lang-fa|فرزاد ناظم}}) (born 1961), also known as Zod Nazem, was [[Yahoo!]]'s [[chief technology officer]] and one of its longest-serving executives. On May 30, 2007, at age 46, he announced that he would retire and leave Yahoo! in June of that year.&lt;ref name="ycorpblog2007"&gt;http://ycorpblog.com/2007/05/30/eleven-years-12000-yahoos-and-one-great-ride/&lt;/ref&gt; Since retirement, Nazem has spent most of his time on investments, philanthropy, and professional mentoring of young entrepreneurs in the technology field.

==Early life==
Nazem began working at the young age of 13 and paid his way through college.  At the age of 19, he graduated with a B.S. degree in Computer Science with highest honors from the [[California Polytechnic State University]]. Upon graduation, he was recruited by [[Rolm Corporation]], a revolutionary technology company of the time.

==Career Highlights==
Nazem started his technical career in the VLCBX Division at Rolm Corporation, producing large, computer-based telephone switches. He was soon recruited to join Sydis Inc., a spin-off of Rolm, as a senior engineer. Sydis was positioning itself to become the leading provider of hybrid telephony and computer platform of the early 1980s. 

In 1985, Nazem joined [[Oracle Corporation]], what was then a small pre-[[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] company. He spent a little over 10 years at Oracle working closely with its CEO, [[Larry Ellison]], on strategic projects like the creation of the “Information Super Highway.” This effort of the early 1990s was meant to bring information and entertainment to consumers’ homes by providing the software platforms for Video Serving and other services to Telcos. By the time Nazem left Oracle, the company had grown from 350 to around 35,000 employees. 

When Nazem was recruited by [[Yahoo!]] in 1996, the company was less than a year old and had yet to go public. At the time, [[Lycos]], [[Infoseek]] and [[Excite]] were considered established and more popular internet search engines while Yahoo! was better described as an internet directory. Nazem was brought to Yahoo! to build the engineering organization, take over site operation, and complete the executive team in preparation for the company’s public debut. 

Under Nazem, Yahoo! became an internet giant. Nazem led several initiatives that helped Yahoo! grow rapidly and distinguish itself from competitors including a very scalable infrastructure composed of farms of small generic servers with a free operating system (FreeBSD). The cost effectiveness and the scalability translated to a more reliable user experience while having the highest profit margins in the industry. In 1997, Yahoo! entered the crowded email market and quickly added hundreds of millions of users, becoming the most popular mail server. Additionally, through all the innovations, Yahoo! became a web portal and originator of the personalized web experience, My Yahoo. 

Throughout Yahoo!’s surge, Nazem spearheaded over 50 company acquisitions, which helped in building out the different services offered by Yahoo!. Almost all of the acquisitions were technology companies and he was in charge of the integration of the people and the services. 

Because of its dedication to innovation and Nazem’s strong and effective leadership, Yahoo! was one of three companies (the other two being [[Ebay]] and [[Amazon.com]]) that survived the internet bubble burst of 2000 and 2001. Collectively these companies were dubbed the “3 horsemen of the Internet.” Particularly significant, Nazem was the only remaining executive from the first phase who remained through the burst and into the second phase of Yahoo!’s growth. As such, he provided stability and continuity and set the groundwork for continual innovation. 

By the time he retired in 2007, Nazem had grown Yahoo!’s engineering team from 6 to 6000 engineers. Additionally, he was credited with establishing a new norm of omnipresent service and the first website to serve hundreds of millions of users without downtime.   When Zod retired from the company in 2007, Yahoo! had 690 million visitors on a monthly basis and employed 12,000 people.

==Post-Yahoo!==
Upon his retirement from day to day operations at Yahoo!, Nazem released an official statement on Yahoo’s corporate blog, Yodel Anecdotal. In this statement, he wrote “After spending the last 26 years in this fast-paced technology industry, I’ve finally decided it's time to slow down. I'll be retiring in early June. After joining tiny little start-ups like Oracle and then Yahoo!, I never imagined things would take off the way they have. And looking back on my eleven years here at Yahoo!, I’m amazed at all that this company has accomplished. Yahoo! has played such a significant role in building the Internet into what it is today and I’m incredibly proud to have been a part of such a talented team.”&lt;ref name="ycorpblog2007"/&gt; 

Nazem’s dedication to Yahoo and the technical community, as well as his influence and impact, continued long after his retirement. While at Yahoo!, Nazem mentored many Yahoo! alumni who have gone on to found, lead, and invest in numerous companies. Now, Nazem spends his time coaching entrepreneurs on technical architecture, market strategy, fundraising, talent development, and mergers and acquisitions. Since 2010, he has invested in more than 60 technology-driven companies  in the areas of big data, cloud, health, and medical. His investments have yielded several successful exits, including acquisitions by [[Google]], [[Yahoo!]], Apigee, [[Twitter]], and [[Cisco]].

==Other Activities==
In 2003, Nazem and his wife, Noosheen Hashemi, co-founded a private family foundation, [[The HAND Foundation]]. He serves on its board of directors. 

Nazem is also on the Board of Trustees of [[The Nueva School]].

==Personal life==
Notorious for avoiding acclaim, Nazem has always stayed in the background and chosen to be low-profile.  Nazem, his wife and two children live in the San Francisco Bay Area.

==Patents==
Nazem currently holds five patents in the area of information technology.

'''Hemming Park''' is a {{convert|1.54|acre|m2|adj=on}} public park, located in the heart of the government center in downtown [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Originally a [[village green]], it was the first and is the oldest park in the city.&lt;ref name=PARK /&gt;

==History==
===Beginnings===
[[Image:StJamesHotel1870s.jpg|thumb|left|St. James Hotel in the 1870s.]]
The area was established as a public square in 1857 by [[Isaiah Hart]], founder of Jacksonville. After Hart's death in 1861 and the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the Hart family deeded the land to the city for $10. It was first known as ''"City Park"'', then ''"St. James Park"'' after the grand [[St. James Building|St. James Hotel]] was constructed across the street in 1869. The following year, another major hotel was built across from the park.

The area was renamed Hemming Park in 1899 in honor of Civil War veteran Charles C. Hemming, after he installed a {{convert|62|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall Confederate monument in the park in 1898.&lt;ref name=PHOTO&gt;[http://www.coj.net/Departments/Central+Operations/Public+Information/Photo+Archive/Photo+Hemming+Plaza.htm City of Jacksonville: Public Information-Photo Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Hemming was born in Jacksonville. He later moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] and became a banker, making a fortune.&lt;ref name=HEMMING /&gt; The memorial is the oldest in the city and was the tallest at the time.&lt;ref name=PARK&gt;[http://apps2.coj.net/parksinternet/parkdetails.asp?parkid=397 City of Jacksonville website: Recreation and Community Services-Hemming Plaza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214056/http://apps2.coj.net/parksinternet/parkdetails.asp?parkid=397 |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HemmingPark1901JX.jpg|thumb|right|430px|Hemming Park after the [[Great Fire of 1901]] showing Hemming's monument in the foreground.]]

The [[Great Fire of 1901]] destroyed most of the wooden structures in Jacksonville and many others, too. Hemming's Confederate monument was one of the few structures to survive the fire. The St. James Hotel burned to the ground and the owner did not have the cash to rebuild. In 1910, Jacob and Morris Cohen, who owned a local dry goods company, engaged 34-year-old architect, [[Henry John Klutho]] to fast track design and manage the construction of a four-story building to house their store. The name "St. James Building" stuck to the property and the building.

===1960s===
During the 1960 presidential campaign, [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] both gave speeches at Hemming Park a few hours apart on October 18.&lt;ref name=LIFE&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/052807/met_173290591.shtml Floridas Times-Union: May 28, 2007-New life in vision for Hemming by Charlie Patton]&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] delivered a speech in Hemming Park on October 26, 1964.
[[Image:Lyndon B. Johnson speaking at Hemming Park- Jacksonville, Florida (8079734708).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lyndon B. Johnson]] campaign speech at Hemming Park in 1960.]]

Because of its high visibility and patronage, the park and surrounding stores were the site of numerous [[civil rights]] demonstrations in the 1960s in the African-American effort to end racial segregation in public facilities. At the time, the city's population was about 45% black. Rutledge Pearson, a local high school teacher, and the NAACP organized many students to participate in [[sit-in]]s. Rodney Hurst was the president at age 16 of the NAACP youth council and years later, said the students were determined to carry out the protests to gain rights of service in stores that gladly accepted .&lt;ref name="andino"/&gt;

Pearson and members of the [[NAACP]] had met with the city's mayor to ask for his support in integration but were rejected.&lt;ref name="yates"/&gt; The sit-ins began on August 13, 1960: students asked to be served at the segregated lunch counters at [[Morrison's Cafeteria]], [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworths]], and other stores, where the black community spent much money in retail purchases. They were denied service and frequently kicked, spit at, and addressed with racial slurs. This pattern continued for two weeks, until the 27th, a day now referred to as [[Ax Handle Saturday]]. On that day, a group of 200 "middle-age and elderly white men,"&lt;ref name="yates"/&gt; including some members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], were arming themselves with axe handles and baseball bats. The student protesters were warned but each wanted to go ahead. The armed group entered the store where they started attacking the students. Some of these found sanctuary in Historic Snyder Memorial, then a Methodist church.&lt;ref name="patton"/&gt; A couple of youths alerted the "Boomerangs," a group of older black youth, who entered the fray to protect the demonstrators.&lt;ref name="patton"&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/082400/enc_3872835.html Charlie Patton, "Discrimination in all its forms must be axed"], ''Florida Times-Union,'' 24 August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1960 Civil Rights Demonstration historical marker, Jacksonville.JPG|thumb|right|1960 Civil Rights Demonstrations historical marker in Hemming Park.]]
Although the organizers had alerted the police when they saw armed men, law enforcement did not intervene until the Boomerangs and other blacks started fighting back to stop the beatings.&lt;ref name="yates"&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/022199/cel_yates.html Alton Yates, "Civil rights"], ''Florida Times-Union'', 21 February 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty people were injured and 62 were arrested, 14 whites and 48 blacks.&lt;ref name="andino"/&gt; The day's events were covered by national TV, as well as major newspapers such as the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref name="andino"/&gt; Alton Yates, participated as a 24-year-old, but said some of the protesters were as young as 13, and he was shocked to see men beating children. He said the organizers gathered their forces again and continued sit-ins. In addition, committees of blacks and whites met to discuss and resolve racial issues.&lt;ref name="yates"/&gt; In April 1961, two leaders of the NAACP Youth Council ate at Woolworth's for a week to prepare the public for integration.&lt;ref name="andino"/&gt;

Finally after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the city completed integration of water fountains, restrooms, and dressing rooms.&lt;ref name="andino"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drbronsontours.com/bronsonhistorypageamericancivilrights.html Gil Wilson, "St. Augustine Civil Rights 1960-1965" ], Dr. Bronson Tours&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="andino"&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/082500/met_axhandle.html Alliniece T.

===Master plan===
[[Image:Fountain, Hemming Park.JPG|thumb|right|290px|Fountain in Hemming Park.]]
The Downtown Development Authority (DDA) was created in 1970 to reverse [[white flight]], related to suburbanization and development of retail malls, and end [[urban blight]]. They hired [[RTKL Associates Inc.]], planning consultants from [[Baltimore]], Maryland to study Jacksonville's situation. Their recommendations were incorporated into the ''1971 Downtown Master Plan'', using the idea of creating a [[Pedestrian mall]] surrounded by a transportation loop and abundant free parking. Another plan component was a group of elevated walkways that would permit shoppers to avoid traffic while moving from the retail core to the riverfront, which would contain a park, convention center including hotel, an exhibition center, Sears Department Store, and a high-rise containing financial offices.&lt;ref name=VISION&gt;[http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2009-sep-visions-of-yesteryear-the-1971-downtown-master-plan], ''Florida Times-Union,''11 September 2009, "Visions of Yesteryear: The 1971 Downtown Master Plan"&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan was supposed to be completed within 20 years, but many components were never implemented.

====Bust====
By the mid-1970s, the image of the park had changed. Because the downtown had been invaded by thousands of [[starlings]], the city had removed shade trees to drive the invaders from the park. The City renovated the park in 1977 at a cost of $648,000,&lt;ref name=VISION /&gt; converting it into a concrete/brick-paved square and changing the name to Hemming Plaza.

The second phase of city redevelopment was budgeted at $2.2 million, but was delayed in 1979. The money was used to construct a University Boulevard overpass of the rail yard adjacent to Philips Highway. Money was again budgeted in 1981, but was used instead to widen 103rd Street. In 1984, the project began, and lasted over two years.&lt;ref name=VISION /&gt;

By this time, the city's big retailers had already built new stores at the malls to meet suburban demand. The last three major stores closed their downtown locations. The empty storefronts attracted the homeless and the 1971 master plan became irrelevant.&lt;ref name=LIFE /&gt;

===Rebuilding===
[[Image:Stjameshemming.JPG|thumb|right|290px|View of [[St. James Building]] and Hemming Park in 2015.]]
The Federal Government spent $84 million for the [[John Milton Bryan Simpson United States Courthouse]], which broke ground in 2000 and opened in 2003, across from the Plaza. Over $162 million was invested by the city in the buildings surrounding Hemming Plaza, including:&lt;ref name=LIFE /&gt;
*St. James Building: $24 million renovation for a new City Hall
*New Downtown Library &amp; parking garage: $100 million
*Ed Ball Building: $25 million renovation for city government office building
*Jacksonville Museum of Contemporary Art: $1.5 million for renovation
*Haverty's Building: $10 million renovation for a new City Hall Annex
*Snyder Memorial Church Building: $1.3 million for renovation

A life-size cast bronze statue of the late U.S. Rep. [[Charles Edward Bennett]], who served Northeast Florida in Congress for 44 years, was installed on a granite base in Hemming Plaza on April 23, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/041604/met_15361081.shtml Florida Times-Union: April 16, 2004- Life-size likeness of Bennett comes to Hemming Plaza by Jessie-Lynne Kerr]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In September 2014, the city of Jacksonville entered into a public-private agreement with the nonprofit organization,&lt;ref&gt;http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2014-11-11/story/changes-hemming-park-starting-next-month-says-group-handling-makeover&lt;/ref&gt; Friends of Hemming Park, to manage the park. The organization is charged with revitalizing and programming the square. The 501(c)3 nonprofit organization was created by community leaders and members of The Cultural Council of Jacksonville, and Downtown Vision, Inc.

The first Wednesday of every month, Hemming Park is converted into the centerpiece of Jacksonville's Downtown Art Walk.

The '''Hong Kong Association of Banks''' ('''HKAB'''; [[Chinese language]]:香港銀行公會 or 銀公會 in short) is an association created based on a series of [[Banking Ordinance|Bank Ordinance]]s enacted since 1948.  In 1981 the association was established and replaced the [[Exchange Bank Association]]. The ordinance provides a framework for the [[Hong Kong Government]] to exchange views with the banking sector for the further development of the industry.

Although [[banking license]]s are granted by the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]], no fully licensed bank can operate in  [[Hong Kong]] is thus subject to HKAB's rules. Its members are the banks, not their employees. HKAB is under the auspices of its member banks, which are represented by their designated representatives in general meetings. Each member bank must designate a senior executive to represent it [[wikt:vis-à-vis|vis-à-vis]] HKAB at meetings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42805">[[File:IsaKidd copper refinery.png|thumb|A modern copper refinery tankhouse using IsaKidd technology.]]

The '''IsaKidd Technology''' is a [[copper]] [[electrorefining]] and [[electrowinning]] technology that was developed independently by Copper Refineries Proprietary Limited (“CRL”), a [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]] subsidiary of [[MIM Holdings Limited]] (which is now part of the [[Glencore]] group of companies), and at the [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge Limited]] (“Falconbridge”) now-dismantled Kidd Creek refinery that was at [[Timmins]], [[Ontario]]. It is based around the use of reusable [[cathode]] starter sheets for [[copper]] electrorefining and the automated stripping of the deposited “cathode copper” from them.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"&gt;J C Jenkins, “Copper tank house technology reviewed and assessed,” in: ''The Aus.I.M.M. North Queensland Branch, Smelting and Refining Operators Symposium, May 1985'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1985), 195–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

The current IsaKidd technology represents the merger of the copper refining technologies developed by the two different organisations. The initial '''Isa Process''' development in the late 1970s, with its reusable stainless-steel cathode starter sheets, represented an advance on the previous technology of single-use starter sheets of pure copper,&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt; the production of which was a labour-intensive process.

The production of the single-use starter sheets involved laying down a sheet of copper by electrolysis on each side of a “mother plate”.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt; Generating the sheet took a day, and thousands of sheets could be needed every day.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt; Originally, the copper starter sheets were separated from the mother plate manually, but over time the process was automated.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Nakai"&gt;O Nakai, H Sato, K Kugiyama and K Baba, “A new starting sheet plant at the Toyo copper refinery and productivity improvements,” in: ''Proceedings of Copper 99–Cobre 99 International Conference, Volume III—Electrorefining and Electrowinning of Copper'', Eds J E Dutrizac, J Ji and V Ramachandran (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999), 279–289.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, limitations associated with the use of copper starter sheets meant that it was difficult to meet the purity specifications of some new copper applications that were, in the 1970s and 1980s, demanding higher quality copper.

The development of the Isa Process tank house technology at CRL eliminated the whole process and cost of producing the starter sheets by using [[Stainless steel|stainless-steel]] permanent cathodes.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt; It also included substantial automation of the process of inserting the permanent cathodes into the electrolytic cells and their subsequent removal and stripping of the sheets of deposited cathode copper.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt; The labour force required to operate a refinery using the IsaKidd technology has been estimated at 60–70% less of that required for refineries using starter sheets.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"&gt;W Armstrong, “The Isa Process and its contribution to electrolytic copper,” paper presented at the ''Rautomead Conference, Scotland, August 1999''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hopkins"&gt;W R Hopkins and I E Lewis, “Recent innovations in SX/EW plants to reduce capital and operating costs,” ''Minerals &amp; Metallurgical Processing'', February 1990, 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

MIM Holdings began marketing the Isa Process technology in 1980, as a result of demand from other refinery operators.

Falconbridge subsequently independently developed a similar process to improve operations at its Kidd Creek copper refinery, near [[Timmins]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name = "About"&gt;[http://www.isaprocess.com/EN/AboutIsaKiddTechnology/Pages/AboutIsaKiddTechnology.aspx “About ISAKIDD Technology.”] Accessed 20 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial development of permanent cathodes was for internal use, but marketing of the '''Kidd Process''' was initiated in 1992 after requests from other refinery operators.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson99"&gt;P E Donaldson and P J Murphy, “Kidd Process permanent cathode technology advancements,” in: ''Proceedings of [sic] Copper 99–Cobre 99 International Conference. Volume III—Electrorefining and Electrowinning of Copper'', Eds J E Dutrizac, J Ji and V Ramachandran (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999) 301–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two technologies were brought together as the IsaKidd Technology in 2006, when Xstrata bought Falconbridge.&lt;ref name = "About"/&gt;

The IsaKidd Technology now dominates global copper refining. It has been licensed to 102 users and Xstrata Technology, which markets the technology, reports on its website a total installed capacity of some 12 million tonnes per year (“t/y”) of copper production, as of October 2011.&lt;ref name = "Installations"&gt;[http://www.isakidd.com/EN/Installations/Pages/Installations.aspx List of IsaKidd installations.] Accessed 20 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is about 60% of the estimated 2011 global refined copper production of 19.7 million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsg.org/index.php/component/jdownloads/finish/170/1188 ''The World Copper Factbook 2012''], International Copper Study Group. Accessed 29 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the IsaKidd technology allowed increased productivity, reduced operating costs and the production of consistent, high-quality cathode copper.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;

==History of the Development of the IsaKidd Technology==

===The old way of electrorefining copper (pre-1978)===

The process of electrorefining copper consists of placing a copper [[anode]] (about 99.5–99.7% pure copper&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Robinson"/&gt;) in [[sulfuric acid]], together with a cathode, and passing a current between the anode and cathode through an external circuit.&lt;ref name = "Robinson"&gt;T Robinson, “Electrolytic refining,” in: ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Fourth Edition'', Eds W G Davenport, M King, M Schlesinger and A K Biswas (Elsevier Science Limited: Kidlington, Oxford, England, 2002) 265–288.&lt;/ref&gt; At the applied [[Galvanic series|electropotential]], copper and less [[Noble metal|noble]] elements dissolve in the [[electrolyte]], while elements more noble than copper, such as [[gold]] and [[silver]], do not.&lt;ref name = "Robinson"/&gt; Under the influence of the applied [[Electric potential|electrical potential]], copper ions migrate from the anode and deposit on the cathode, forming cathode copper.&lt;ref name = "Robinson"/&gt;

Electrolytic refining of copper was first patented in England by James Elkington in 1865 and the first electrolytic copper refinery was built in Newark, New Jersey, in 1883.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;

There were teething problems with the new technology. For example, the early refineries had trouble producing firm deposits on the cathodes.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; As a result, there was much secrecy between refinery operators as each strove to maintain a competitive edge.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;

The nature of the cathode used to collect the copper is a critical part of the technology. The properties of copper are highly susceptible to impurities. For example, an arsenic content of 0.1% can reduce the conductivity of copper by 23% and a bismuth content of just 0.001% makes copper brittle.&lt;ref name = "Lynch"&gt;D C Lynch, S Akagi and W G Davenport, “Thermochemical nature of minor elements in copper smelting mattes,” ''Metallurgical Transactions B'', 22B, October 1991, 677–688.&lt;/ref&gt; The material used in the cathode must not contaminate the copper being deposited, or it will not meet the required specifications.

The current efficiency of the refining process depends, in part, on how close the anodes and cathodes can be placed in the electrolytic cell. This, in turn, depends on the straightness of both the anode and the cathode. Bumps and bends in either can lead to short-circuiting or otherwise affect the current distribution and also the quality of the cathode copper.&lt;ref name = "Robinson"/&gt;

[[File:Rack of copper cathode starter sheets.png|thumb|Figure 1. A crane carrying a rack of starter sheet cathode.]]
Prior to the development of the Isa Process technology, the standard approach was to use a starter sheet of high-purity copper as the initial cathode.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt; These starter sheets are produced in special electrolytic cells by electrodeposition of copper for 24 hours&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; onto a plate made of copper coated with oil&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt; (or treated with other similar face-separation materials) or of [[titanium]].&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; Thousands of sheets could be needed every day,&lt;ref name = "Nakai"/&gt; and the original method of separating the starter sheet from the “mother plate” (referred to as “stripping”) was entirely manual.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt;

Starter sheets are usually quite light. For example, the starter sheets used in the CRL refinery weighed 10 pounds (4.53 kilograms).&lt;ref name = "Saint"&gt;J C Jenkins and J C Saint-Smith, “Townsville copper refinery,” ''Proceedings of the Aus.I.M.M.'', No. 197, 1961, 239–260.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they are thin and need to be handled carefully to avoid bending.

[[File:Copper cathode from copper starter sheets.png|thumb|Figure 2. Cathode copper deposited on copper starter sheets.]]
Over time, the formation of starter sheets was improved by mechanisation, but there was still a high labour input.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt;

Once the starter sheets were formed, they had to be flattened, to reduce the likelihood of short circuits, and then cut, formed and punched to make loops from which the starter sheets are hung from conductive copper hanger bars in the electrolytic cells (see Figure 1).&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;
 
The starter sheets are inserted in the refining cells and dissolved copper deposits on them to produce the cathode copper product (see Figure 2). Because of the manufacturing cost of the starter sheets, refineries using them tend to keep them in the cells as long as possible, usually 12–14 days.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; On the other hand, the anodes normally reside in the cells for 24–28 days, meaning that there are two cathodes produced from each anode.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;
 
The starter sheets have a tendency to warp, due to the mechanical stresses they encounter and often need to be removed from the refining cells after about two days to be straightened in presses before being returned to the cells.&lt;ref name = "Schlesinger"&gt;M E Schlesinger, M J King, K C Sole and W G Davenport, Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Fifth Edition (Elsevier: 2011), 259.&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency to warp leads to frequent short-circuiting.&lt;ref name = "Schlesinger"/&gt;

Due to their limitations, it is difficult for copper produced on starter sheets to meet modern specifications for the highest-purity copper.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"&gt;P E Donaldson and J J Detulleo, “Falconbridge’s Kidd Copper Refinery – birthplace of the Kidd Process: an update on the refinery and the latest developments in the Kidd Process”, in: ''Copper 2003–Cobre 2003. Volume V — Copper Electrorefining and Electrowinning, Santiago, Chile, 30 November–3 December 2003'', Eds: J E Dutrizac and C G Clement (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum: Montreal, 2003), 165–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The development of the Isa Process technology===

The development of the Isa Process tank house technology had its beginning in the zinc industry.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; During the mid-1970s, MIM Holdings Limited (“MIM”) was considering building a zinc refinery in Townsville to treat the zinc concentrate produced by its [[Mount Isa]] operations.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; As a result, MIM staff visited the zinc smelters using the best-practice technology and found that modern electrolytic zinc smelters had adopted permanent cathode plate and mechanised stripping technology.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;

MIM recognised that the performance of traditional copper refineries was constrained by the poor cathode geometry inherent in using copper starter sheets.&lt;ref&gt;N J Aslin, D Stone and W Webb, [http://www.isakidd.com/EN/Downloads/Technical%20Papers/Current%20Distribution%20in%20Modern%20Copper%20Refining.pdf. “Current distribution in modern copper refining,”] in: ''Proceedings of the International Symposium on Computational Analysis'', Eds M J Dry and D G Dixon (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum: 2005). Accessed 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

MIM then developed a research program aimed at developing similar permanent cathode technology for copper refining.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; CRL had been operating in Townsville since 1959,&lt;ref name = "Saint"/&gt; using conventional starter-sheet technology&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt; and treating [[Copper extraction techniques#Converting|blister copper]] produced in the [[Mount Isa Mines]] Limited copper smelter at [[Mount Isa]] in Queensland.&lt;ref name = "Saint"/&gt; CRL incorporated the permanent cathode technology in its 1978 refinery modernisation project.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; The material initially selected was [[SAE steel grades#Stainless steel|316L]] stainless steel,&lt;ref name = "Aslin"&gt;N J Aslin, O Eriksson, G J Heferen and G Sue Yek, [http://www.isakidd.com/EN/Downloads/Technical%20Papers/Developments%20in%20Cathode%20Stripping%20Machines%20-%20An%20Integrated%20Approach%20for%20Improved%20Efficiency.pdf “Developments in cathode stripping machines – an integrated approach for improved efficiency,”] in: ''Proceedings of Cu 2010, Hamburg, Germany, 6–10 June 2010''. Accessed 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; stitch-welded to a [[SAE steel grades#Stainless steel|304L]] stainless-steel hanger bar.&lt;ref name = "Webb"&gt;W Webb and J Weston, [http://www.isakidd.com/EN/Downloads/Technical%20Papers/developments_in_steel_cathodes1.pdf “The development of a “lower resistance” permanent cathode (ISA Cathode BR),”] Minera Chilena, March–April 2003. Accessed 28 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The hanger-bar assembly was then electroplated with copper to a thickness of 1.3 millimeters (“mm”) (later increased to 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm and then 3.0&amp;nbsp;mm to improve the corrosion resistance of the hanger bar) to approximately 15&amp;nbsp;mm down onto the blade, which provided sufficient electrical conductivity and gave the assembly some corrosion resistance.&lt;ref name = "Webb"/&gt;

Electrodeposited copper adheres quite firmly to the stainless steel so that it does not detach during refining.&lt;ref name = "Schlesinger"/&gt; The vertical edges of the stainless steel plates are covered with tight-fitting polymer edge strips to prevent copper depositing around the edge of the cathode plate and so make it easier to strip the cathode copper from them.&lt;ref name = "Schlesinger"/&gt; The bottom of the cathode plates were masked with a thin film of wax, again to prevent the copper depositing around the bottom edge.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; Wax was used rather than an edge strip to avoid having a ledge that would collect falling anode slimes and contaminate the cathode copper.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;

Wax was also used on the vertical edges to prolong the life of the vertical edge strip.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;

The original cathode stripping machine was based on that used at the Hikoshima plant of the [[Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting|Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company]] of [[Japan]].&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; However, considerable development work was necessary to modify the design to handle the copper cathodes, which were heavier than those at Hikoshima, and to process the cathode plates without damaging them.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; The machines also had to be redesigned to allow for waxing the sides and bottoms of the cathode plates to allow the next copper cathode sheets to be removed easily.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;

[[File:Isa Process cathode stripping machine.png|thumb|Figure 3. An IsaProcess automated cathode stripping machine.]]
The stripping machines included receiving and discharge conveyors, washing, separation, cathode stacking and discharging, cathode plate separation for refurbishing, and the wax applications for the sides and bottoms of the cathode plates.&lt;ref name = "Hopkins"/&gt;
 
The original CRL stripping machine had the capability of stripping 250 cathode plates per hour.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;

The lower cost of the cathode plates compared to starter sheets means that shorter cathode cycle times are possible.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; The cycle time can range from 5 to 14 days, but a seven-day cathode cycle is common.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; This shorter cycle time improves current efficiency as less short circuits occur and there is less nodulation of the cathode surface.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;

Initially, other refinery operators regarded the developments at CRL with scepticism.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt; Stainless steel had been tried unsuccessfully as mother-plate material for copper starter sheets.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt; They suffered from rapid deterioration of their strippability, resulting in “an almost daily increase in difficulty of stripping”.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt; However, following the success of early installations in Townsville, Timmins, and many other places, the permanent stainless steel cathode technology has had widespread introduction.&lt;ref name = "Schlesinger"/&gt;

===Moving into electrowinning plants===

The Isa Process was originally developed for the CRL copper electrorefinery in Townsville. It was subsequently licensed to the [[Copper Range Company]] for its [[Copper Range Company#White Pine mine|White Pine]] copper refinery.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

The next licence issued was for an electrowinning application at the [[Port Pirie#History|Broken Hill Associated Smelters]] (“BHAS”) lead smelter at [[Port Pirie]], in [[South Australia]]. BHAS commissioned in 1985 a solvent extraction and electrowinning (“SX–EW”) to recover copper from copper–lead matte produced as a by-product of the lead smelting operations.&lt;ref name = "Meadows"&gt;N E Meadows and M Valenti, “The BHAS copper–lead matte treatment plant,” in: ''Non-ferrous Smelting Symposium, Port Pirie, South Australia, September 1989'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1989), 153–157.&lt;/ref&gt; The process used involves leaching the copper from the material using an acidic chloride–sulfate solution, followed by solvent extraction to concentrate the leached copper and electrowinning.&lt;ref name = "Tyson"&gt;R K Tyson, N E Meadows and A D Pavlich, “Copper production from matte at Pasminco Metals — BHAS, Port Pirie, SA,” in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy.

[[Electrowinning]] copper differs from electrorefining in that electrorefining uses a copper anode that is dissolved and redeposited on the cathode, while in electrowinning the copper is already in solution and is extracted from the solution by passing a current through the solution using an inert lead-alloy anode, and a cathode.&lt;ref name = "Robinson2"&gt;T Robinson, “Electrowinning,” in: ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Fourth Edition'', Eds W G Davenport, M King, M Schlesinger and A K Biswas (Elsevier Science Limited: Kidlington, Oxford, England, 2002) 327–339.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chloride in the leach solution at Port Pirie proved to be a problem for the stainless steel cathodes of the Isa Process.&lt;ref name = "Meadows"/&gt; A small amount of the chloride ions in the leach solution passed through the solvent into the electrolyte, leading to a reported chloride concentration of 80 milligrams per liter (“mg/L”) in the electrolyte.&lt;ref name = "Meadows"/&gt; The presence of the chloride in the electrolyte caused pitting corrosion of the stainless steel cathode plates.&lt;ref name = "Meadows"/&gt; After trying other types of stainless steel,&lt;ref name = "Meadows"/&gt; BHAS switched to using titanium cathode plates.&lt;ref name = "Tyson"/&gt;

Other electrowinning operations followed, including [[Ross H. Stanfield|Gibraltar Mines]]’ [[McLeese Lake, British Columbia|McLeese Lake]] operation and Magma Copper’s [[San Manuel copper mine]] in 1986, the Mexicana de [[Cananea]] operation in Mexico in 1989, and the Gunpowder Copper Limited operation at Gunpowder in north-west Queensland 1990.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; These operations did not suffer the chloride corrosion problems experienced by BHAS.

===The development of the Kidd Process technology===

[[Falconbridge Limited]] in mid-1981 commissioned a copper smelter and refinery near Timmins, Ontario, to treat concentrate from its [[Kidd Mine]].&lt;ref&gt;C J Newman, G Macfarlane and K Molnar, “Oxygen usage in the Kidd Creek smelter,” in: ''The Impact of Oxygen on the Productivity of Non-ferrous Metallurgical Processes, Winnipeg, Canada, 23–26 August 1987'', Eds G Kachaniwsky and C Newman (Pergamon Press: Toronto, 1987), 259–268.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the outset, the quality of the cathode copper produced in the Kidd refinery suffered from the presence of higher than usual concentrations of lead and selenium in the copper smelter’s anodes.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson99"/&gt; Kidd cathode copper was not able to meet its customers’ specifications and obtaining product certification for the [[London Metal Exchange]] (“LME”) became a key focus.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson99"/&gt;

After several process improvements were instigated, it was ultimately realised that the use of copper starter sheets was preventing the Kidd refinery meeting its cathode quality targets.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson99"/&gt; Test work then began on the use of permanent stainless-steel cathodes.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson99"/&gt; Preliminary tests using full-scale titanium blanks showed a reduction in the lead content of the cathode copper of a factor of four and a six-fold reduction in the selenium content, compared with the use of copper starter sheets.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson99"/&gt;

The focus then shifted to developing a stripping machine, to develop stainless steel cathodes incorporating the existing header bars and evaluating edge-strip technology.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson99"/&gt; The company’s board of directors gave approval for the conversion of the refinery to the Kidd technology in April 1985.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson99"/&gt; The conversion was completed in 1986&lt;ref name = "Donaldson99"/&gt; and the Kidd refinery became the third&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; to install permanent cathode and automated stripping technology.

Falconbridge began marketing the technology in 1992, after many requests from other refinery operators.&lt;ref name = "About"/&gt; Thus, the Kidd Process created competition between two suppliers of permanent cathode technology. The main differences between them were the cathode header bar, edge stripping and the stripping machine technology.&lt;ref&gt;W G Davenport, “Copper extraction from the 60’s into the 21st century,” in: ''Proceedings of [sic] Copper 99–Cobre 99 International Conference. Volume I—Plenary Lectures/Movement of Copper and Industry Outlook/Copper Applications and Fabrication'', Ed G A Eltringham, N L Piret and M Sahoo (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999), 55–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the stainless steel header bar then used in the Isa Process cathode, the Kidd Process cathode used a solid copper header bar, which was welded onto the stainless steel sheet.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt; This gave a lower voltage drop (by 8–10 millivolts) than the Isa Process cathode.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt;

The Isa Process technology used the waxed edge at the bottom of the cathode plate to stop the copper depositing around the plate’s bottom to form a single mass of copper running from the top of one side of the cathode plate around the bottom to the top of the other side.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt; The copper was stripped from the cathode plates as two separate sheets.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt; The Kidd Process technology did not use wax, as it was thought that it could exacerbate the impurity problems with which the plant had been struggling. At Kidd, the stripping approach was to remove the copper from the cathode plate as a single “V”-shaped cathode product, akin to a taco shell.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt;

The Kidd Process initially used a “carousel” stripping machine, but a linear installation was subsequently developed to provide machines with lower to medium stripping capacities for electrowinning plants and smaller refineries.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt; The linear stripping machines, first installed in 1996, were more compact, less complex and had lower installation costs than the carousel machines.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt;

===New advances===

====Waxless cathode plates====

As outlined above, the Kidd Process did not use wax on its permanent cathodes.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; This highlighted disadvantages associated with the use of wax by the Isa Process.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; Cathode copper consumers applied pressure to producers to remove residual wax from the cathode copper, and the use of wax also created “housekeeping” problems for Isa Process operators.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;

Consequently, MIM commenced a development program in 1997 aimed at eliminating the use of wax.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; This resulted in a new process called the Isa 2000 technology, which was able to produce single-sheet cathode (as opposed to the Kidd taco shell cathode) without using wax.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt;

[[File:Cathode starter sheet V-groove.png|thumb|Figure 4. Effect of the V-groove at the bottom edge of the cathode starting plate on the deposited cathode copper.]]
This was achieved by machining a 90° “V”-groove into the bottom edge of the cathode.&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"&gt;K L Eastwood and G W Whebell, [http://www.isakidd.com/EN/Downloads/Technical%20Papers/developments_in_steel_cathodes1.pdf. “Developments in permanent stainless steel cathodes within the copper industry,”] in: ''Proceedings of the Sixth International Copper–Cobre Conference, Toronto, Canada, 25–30 August 2007. Volume V—Copper Electrorefining and Electrowinning'' (The Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum: 2007), 35–46. Accessed 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The groove weakens the structure of the copper growing at the bottom edge of the cathode plate because the copper crystals grow perpendicular to the cathode plate from opposite sides of the groove, causing them to intersect at right angles to each other.&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt; A discontinuity in the structure is formed at the intersection that results in a weak zone, along which the copper splits during stripping.&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt;

Figure 4 is a microscope view of the cross-section a copper cathode growing at the tip of a cathode plate. The yellow lines show the orientation and direction of crystal growth.&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt;

====Low-resistance cathodes====

The standard Isa Process cathodes have slightly higher electrical resistance than solid-copper hanger bar systems used by the Kidd Process, meaning that there is a higher power cost.&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt; However, this cost is offset by greater reliability and predictability in the increase in resistance over time, allowing for maintenance planning.&lt;ref name = "Webb"/&gt;

The solid-copper hanger bars, on the other hand, lose electrical performance over a shorter period of time due to corrosive attack on the joint and sudden failure is possible.&lt;ref name = "Webb"/&gt; The maintenance costs of such systems are greater and less predictable.&lt;ref name = "Webb"/&gt; A trial of approximately 3000 solid-copper hanger bars, found over time a lower current efficiency in the solid-copper hanger bars of about 2.4%.&lt;ref name = "Webb"/&gt;

[[File:BR stainlessless steel starter sheets for copper refining.png|thumb|Figure 5. IsaKidd BR cathode plates.]]
The MIM development team looked for other ways to reduce the resistance of the cathode plates and developed a new low-resistance cathode, which it called ISA Cathode BR.&lt;ref name = "Webb"/&gt; This new design extended the copper plating from 15–17&amp;nbsp;mm down the blade to approximately 55&amp;nbsp;mm, and it increased the thickness of the copper to 3.0&amp;nbsp;mm from the 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm used on the standard cathode.&lt;ref name = "Webb"/&gt;
 
The new cathode plate design was tested in the CRL refinery in Townsville and at Compania Minera Zaldivar in Chile.&lt;ref name = "Webb"/&gt; The Chilean results indicated the new cathode design had the potential to reduce power costs by approximately US$100,000 in 2003 for the plant, compared to using conventional Isa Process cathode designs.&lt;ref name = "Webb"/&gt;

====Lower-cost stainless steel cathode plates====

From 2001 to 2007, [[nickel]] prices rose from an average of US$5945&lt;ref&gt;P H Kuck, “Nickel,” in: ''Mineral Commodity Summaries 2004'' (United States Geological Survey: 2004), 114.&lt;/ref&gt; to US$37,216.&lt;ref&gt;P H Kuck, “Nickel,” in: ''Mineral Commodity Summaries 2011'' (United States Geological Survey: 2011), 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Nickel is a key constituent of 316L stainless steel.&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt; This, combined with increases in some of the other constituents of the 316L alloy, prompted Xstrata Technology (by then the marketing organisation for the Isa Process technology) to seek an alternative material for the cathode plates.&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt;

Xstrata Technology personnel investigated the use of a new low-alloyed [[Stainless steel#Types of stainless steel|duplex stainless steel]], LDX 2101 and [[SAE steel grades#Stainless steel|304L stainless steel]].&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt; The LDX 2101 contains 1.5% nickel compared to 10–14% in 316L stainless steel.

LDX 2101 has superior mechanical strength to the 316L stainless steel, allowing thinner sheets to be used for the cathode plates.&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt; However, the flatness tolerance of commercially available LDX 2101 steel did not meet the required specifications.&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt; Xstrata Technology worked with a manufacturer to produce sheets that did meet the required flatness tolerance.&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt;

Xstrata Technology also had to develop a finish that allowed the surface to function in the same way as 316L.&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt;

Cathode plates using LDX 2010 have equivalent corrosion resistance to 316L plates.&lt;ref name = "Cathode"&gt;[http://www.isakidd.com/EN/IsaKiddTechnologyServices/Pages/CathodePlates.aspx “Cathode plates.”] Accessed 28 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDX 2101 alloy provides an alternative to the 316L stainless steel,&lt;ref name = "Eastwood"/&gt; with the selection depending on relatively prices of the various steels.

====High corrosion resistance====

The Kidd Process development team modified its cathode plates to cope with high-corrosion environments, such as the liberator cells used to remove contaminants in refineries and some high-corrosion environments in electrowinning plants.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt;

The design of the plate features a stainless-steel jacket that surrounds a solid-copper hanger bar, protecting it from corrosion.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt; A corrosion-resistant resin inside the stainless steel jacket protects the conductive interior weld between the header bar and the plate.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt; The hanger bar is then finished with high-quality sealing to prevent ingress of electrolytes into the conductive interior weld.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt;

This corrosion resistance electrode is marketed as the HP cathode plate.&lt;ref name = "Cathode"/&gt;

====The Kidd Process High Capacity Linear Machine====

After the initial carousel stripping machine development and the later development of the linear stripping machine, Falconbridge personnel developed the Kidd Process High Capacity Linear Machine (“HCLM”).&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt; This machine included a loading and unloading system that was based on robotics.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt;

The new design improved, among other things, the discharge area of the stripper. This had been a problem area for the carousel stripping machines, in which copper released from the cathode plate fell into an envelope and was then transferred to a material handling device.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt; Copper that misbehaved and failed to transfer often required manual intervention.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt; The new robot discharge system eliminated the free falling of the copper and physically transferred the released copper to the discharge location.&lt;ref name = "Donaldson"/&gt;

===The birth of the combined IsaKidd technology===

After Falconbridge’s 1992 decision to market the Kidd technology, the Falconbridge and the then MIM Process Technologies groups competed for the tank house technology market. Between 1992 and 2006, 25 Kidd technology licences were sold,&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; while there were 52 Isa process licences sold in the same period.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

Xstrata plc (now Glencore Xstrata) took over MIM Holdings in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xstrata.com/assets/acquisition/mim/pdf/XTA_MIM_Acquisition_Rights_Issue_07_04_03.pdf Recommended Acquisition of M.I.M. Holdings Limited for US$2,959 million and Rights Issue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812043939/http://www.xstrata.com/assets/acquisition/mim/pdf/XTA_MIM_Acquisition_Rights_Issue_07_04_03.pdf |date=2011-08-12 }}. Accessed 2 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Isa Process technology continued to be developed and marketed by Xstrata Technology. Xstrata subsequently took over Falconbridge in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=2c7b0cfe-14be-40dc-8d92-8a74685e9782&amp;p=4 “How Xstrata won Falconbridge,”] ''Financial Post''. Accessed 29 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kidd Process technology consequently became part of the Xstrata Technology tank house package and together they began to be marketed as IsaKidd,&lt;ref name = "About"/&gt; a name that represents the dual heritage of the technology.

The result has been a technology package that combined what were mutually regarded as the best of both versions.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt; This combination led to the development of new stripping systems and new cathode designs are in development.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt;

The variation in copper deposits on the cathode plates was one of the difficulties encountered with the earlier stripping machines.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt; Areas of thin copper on the cathode plates, which are caused by short circuits, are difficult to separate from the stainless steel plate due to their lack of rigidity. Plates bearing such areas generally had to be rejected from the stripping machine and stripped manually.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt; Similarly, sticky copper deposits (generally related to poor surface condition on the cathode plate, such as corroded surfaces or improper mechanical treatment), heavily nodulated cathode and laminated copper caused problems for stripping.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt;

Stripping machine development focussed on developing a device that could be seen as a more accommodating and universal stripping machine that could handle cathode plates with problem copper deposits without rejecting them or slowing the stripping rate.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt;

[[File:Robotic cathode copper stripping machine.png|thumb|Figure 6. An IsaKidd robotic cathode stripping machine.]]
The result of this work was a new robotic cathode stripping machine.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt; It incorporated the following features:
* a stripping wedge that starts removing the copper from the top of the cathode plate and moves down to the bottom
* guides to support the copper during the downwards motion to ensure that the copper does not strip prematurely
* rollers designed to reduce the friction between the copper, the cathode plate and the wedge during the downward motion of the wedge
* grippers that clamp the copper before it is pulled away from the cathode plate.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt;

The stripping wedges are mounted on two robotic arms, one for each side of the cathode plate.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt; These arms strip the copper from the plate and lay the sheets of cathode copper onto conveyors for them to be taken away for bundling.&lt;ref name = "Aslin"/&gt;

==Advantages of the IsaKidd Technology==

Advantages cited for the IsaKidd technology include:
* ''long life'' – the operational life of the permanent cathodes without repair is said to be over seven years under correct operating conditions for electrowinning applications and over 15 years for electrorefining applications&lt;ref name = "Webb"/&gt; 
* ''reduced labour costs'' – due to the elimination of the starter-sheet production process&lt;ref name = "Eamon"&gt;M A Eamon and J G Jenkins, “Plant practices &amp; innovations at Magma Copper Company’s San Manuel SX-EW plant,” in: ''EPD Congress ’91'', Ed D R Gaskell (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1991), 239–252.&lt;/ref&gt; and the automation of cathode stripping.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; The average labour requirement for refineries based on the IsaKidd technology is 0.9 man-hours per tonne of cathode, compared to 2.4 man-hours/t for tank houses using starter sheets.&lt;ref name = "Schlesinger"/&gt; Atlantic Copper personnel reported a figure of 0.43 man-hours/t for the Huelva refinery in Spain in 1998&lt;ref&gt;P Barrios, A Alonso and C Ortiz, “Improvements in the operating practices at the Atlantic Copper refinery,” in: ''Proceedings of [sic] Copper 99–Cobre 99 International Conference, Volume III—Electrorefining and Electrowinning of Copper'', Eds J E Dutrizac, J Ji and V Ramachandran (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999), 291–299.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''no suspension loops'' – the suspension loops of starter sheets can corrode and thus cause cutting of the electrolytic cell liners.&lt;ref name = "Hopkins"/&gt; The lack of suspension loops also makes crane handling easier&lt;ref name = "Hopkins"/&gt;
* ''improved cathode quality''&lt;ref name = "Schlesinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kordosky"&gt;G A Kordosky, “Copper recovery using leach/solvent extraction/electrowinning technology: forty years of innovation, 2.2 million tonnes of copper annually,” ''The Journal of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy'', November–December 2002, 445–450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Garvey"&gt;J Garvey, B J Ledeboer and J M Lommen, “Design, start-up and operation of the Cyprus Miami copper refinery,” in: ''Proceedings of [sic] Copper 99–Cobre 99 International Conference, Volume III—Electrorefining and Electrowinning of Copper'', Eds J E Dutrizac, J Ji and V Ramachandran (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999), 107–126.&lt;/ref&gt; – due to the straight cathode plates, which eliminates short-circuiting,&lt;ref name = "Eamon"/&gt; and the lack of bends and other surface irregularities reduces the capture of contaminants such as floating arsenic, antimony and bismuth&lt;ref&gt;C Wenzl, A Filzwieser and H Antrekowitsch, "Review of anode casting – Part I: chemical anode quality,” ''Erzmetall'', 60(2), 2007, 77–83.&lt;/ref&gt; and other slimes compounds.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; The elimination of the starter-sheet suspension loops also improved cathode quality.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; In SX–EW operations, the use of stainless-steel cathode plates eliminates lead flakes and other debris from the cathode copper.&lt;ref name = "Addison"&gt;J R Addison, B J Savage, J M Robertson, E P Kramer and J C Stauffer, “Implementing technology: conversion of Phelps Dodge Morenci, Inc. Central EW tankhouse from copper starter sheets to stainless steel technology,” in: ''Proceedings of [sic] Copper 99–Cobre 99 International Conference, Volume III—Electrorefining and Electrowinning of Copper'', Eds J E Dutrizac, J Ji and V Ramachandran (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999), 609–618.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''improved current efficiency''&lt;ref name = "Kordosky"/&gt; – this arises both from eliminating short circuits caused by bent and irregular electrodes&lt;ref name = "Eamon"/&gt; and from the shorter cathode cycles possible with the use of the reusable cathode plates.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; Current efficiencies of over 98% are claimed&lt;ref name = "Webb"/&gt; 
* ''increased refining intensity'' – this reduces the number of electrolytic cells needed in a refinery and its capital cost because the gap between the anodes and the cathodes can be narrower due to the lower risk of short circuits&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; and because the current density can be increased, making the refining process faster.&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; Refineries operating with the IsaKidd technology can achieve current densities of 330 amperes per square meter (“A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;”) of cathode area, whereas a refinery using starter sheets can only operate at around 240 A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; 
* ''shorter cathode cycles'' – shorter cathode cycles are possible using the IsaKidd technology, which reduces the metal inventory&lt;ref name = "Hopkins"/&gt; and means that the refinery or SX–EW operator is paid more quickly
* ''shorter anode cycles'' – the higher intensity of the refining also results in about a 12% reduction in anode cycle time,&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; also reducing the metal inventory
[[File:Bundles of cathode copper.png|thumb|Figure 7. Cathode copper bundles strapped for transport to market.]]
 
* ''uniform cathode copper sheets for ease of transport'' – the control over the dimensions of the copper sheets made possible by the IsaKidd technology, provides uniform cathode bundles that can be securely strapped and easily transported (see Figure 7)&lt;ref name = "Armstrong"/&gt; 
* ''improved safety''&lt;ref name = "Garvey"/&gt; – elimination of much of the manual handling leads to improved safety conditions in the workplace.&lt;ref name = "Eamon"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Addison"/&gt;
 
Staff of the Cyprus Miami copper refinery wrote after their installation of the Isa Process technology that: “It is now well proven that tankhouses applying stainless steel cathode technology can consistently produce high quality cathodes while operating at higher cathode current density and at a lower cathode spacing than those used in conventional tankhouses.”&lt;ref name = "Garvey"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45863">'''Labour Standards in the World Trade Organization''' are binding rules, which form a part of the [[jurisprudence]] and principles applied within the rule making institutions of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). Labour standards play an implicit, but not an overt role within the WTO, however it forms a prominent issue facing the WTO today, and has generated a wealth of academic debate.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, Trade and Labour Standards: Subject of intense debate accessed 4/3/2007, http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min99_e/english/about_e/18lab_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about the extent to which the WTO should recognise labour standards is typically based on the principles found in Conventions of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), as well as mainstream human rights treaties, most prominently, the [[International Bill of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Includes [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|the Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and its two protocols.&lt;/ref&gt;

== WTO Overview ==
{{main|World Trade Organization}}
The WTO is an international institution that deals with the rules of trade between countries with the view of [[List of Latin phrases (F–O)|inter alia]] "raising [[Standard of living|standards of living]], [and] ensuring full employment…".&lt;ref name="wto.org"&gt;World Trade Organization, 'Preamble', Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, par. 1 http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/04-wto.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through a series of trade liberalising agreements based on consensus from the WTO's 164 members who form the General Council.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, Understanding the WTO: The Organization, Members and Observers accessed 4/3/2007 http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqfQ6Tl4?url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm |date=January 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Council, sitting as the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) has the jurisdictional power to solve disputes brought before it, and is able to approve trade restrictive measures to enforce compliance with agreements.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, Understanding the WTO: Settling Disputes accessed 4/03/2007 http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/disp1_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO's dispute settlement process is compulsory and the DSB's recommendations and rulings immediately become binding [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J 2005, 'The Role of International Law in Trade', Georgetown Journal of International Law, Vol. 36; Iss. 3; pp 663, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the WTO===
The WTO has its origins in the 1944 [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods Conference]] which was convened by the Allied nations towards the end of World War II with the aim of establishing an international economic order. Although the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (now known as the World Bank) were created, the International Trade Organisation (ITO), the forerunner of the WTO, was only a proposition at this point. It was not until 1947 that negotiations were concluded and the ITO came into being. In the [[Havana Charter]], the text of the ITO, Article 7 pertained specifically to fair labour standards, requiring that members of the organisation must, amongst other things, "take fully into account the rights of workers under [[Intergovernmentalism|inter-governmental]] declarations, conventions and agreements" and recognise "that all countries have a common interest in the achievement and maintenance of fair labour standards related to productivity, and thus in the improvement of wages and working conditions as productivity may permit".&lt;ref&gt;Final Act of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment: Havana Charter for an International Trade Organisation Havana Charter accessed 4/3/2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim period before the ratification of the charter, states decided to follow an interim agreement, known as the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), which was to be later incorporated into the ITO's legal framework. This temporary arrangement did not include any references to [[Labor rights|labour rights]]. The requisite number of states failed to ratify the ITO and so it failed and GATT became the basis for the current world trade system.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;Wilkinson, R 1999, 'Labour and trade related regulation: beyond the trade-labour standards debate?', British Journal of Politics and [[International relations|International Relations]], vol.1, no.2, pp 165-191&lt;/ref&gt;

The WTO was established 1 January 1995 as a result of the [[Uruguay Round]] of negotiations (1986–1994). It was formed from the GATT, which became one of the core agreements annexed to the [[Marrakesh Agreement]], the document establishing the WTO. None of the other WTO agreements concluded at the end of the Uruguay Round include labour rights obligations. The effects of GATT are still felt and some commentators have described the WTO as the one major international governance organisation that does not examine the impact of its policies upon the ability of member states to advance human rights.&lt;ref name="Aaronson"&gt;Aaronson, S &amp; Zimmerman, J Nov 2006, 'Fair trade? How Oxfam presented a systematic approach to Poverty, Development, Human Rights &amp; Trade' [[Human Rights Quarterly]], vol.28, no. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|998, 1014}}

== Problems with the Current Approach ==
The WTO currently does not have jurisdiction over labour standards and the only place in which they are mentioned in the entire set of WTO Agreements is in GATT Article XX e) "relating to the products of prison labour".&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Since the formation of the WTO in 1995 there have been increasing calls for action on the labour standards issue,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Hughes and Rorden Wilkinson (2000), "Labor standards and global governance: examining the dimensions of institutional engagement", Global Governance, 6: 2, pp. 259-277&lt;/ref&gt; and requests for a "human face on the world economy". The United Nations is among those bodies which have criticised the current system, and have called for a shift to a human rights oriented approach to trade, with steps to be taken "to ensure that human rights principles and obligations are fully integrated in future negotiations in the World Trade Organization",&lt;ref name="Realization_63"&gt;United Nations [[Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights]], The Realization of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of human rights, par.63 http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/E.CN.4.Sub.2.2000.13.En?Opendocument&lt;/ref&gt; as the "primacy of [[human rights law]] over all other regimes of international law is a basic and fundamental principle that should not be departed from".&lt;ref name="Realization_63"/&gt; It is clear that states have both a legal and a [[moral obligation]] to uphold human rights standards, inclusive of their activities in the economic sphere. The United Nations (UN) Charter states that in "the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the present Charter and their obligations under any other [[Treaty|international agreement]], their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail".'Charter of the United Nations', Chapter XVI, Article 103 of Charter. The UN Charter explicitly advocates the upholding of human rights and fundamental freedoms.'Charter of the United Nations', preamble, art. 62(2). This means that respect for human rights, and within this, labour standards, effectively trumps any conflicting WTO Agreements. However, not all [[World Trade Organization|WTO members]] are [[United Nations member states|members of the UN]] (e.g. Taiwan), which raises issues.

== Core Labour Standards ==
{{main|International Labour Organization}}
Identified by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in the 'Declaration of the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work',&lt;ref name="adb.org"&gt;International Labour Organization 2006, 'Core Labour Standards Handbook', Manilla {{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/Handbooks/Core-Labor-Standards/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518043950/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Handbooks/Core-Labor-Standards/default.asp |archivedate=2009-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; core labour standards are "widely recognised to be of particular importance".&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 1996 'Trade, Employment and Labour Standards: A Study of Core Workers' Rights and International Trade'&lt;/ref&gt; They are universally applicable, regardless of whether the relevant conventions have been ratified, the level of development of a country or cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations [[United Nations Global Compact|Global Compact]], Labour, http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/TheTenPrinciples/labourStandards.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303183906/http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/TheTenPrinciples/labourStandards.html |date=March 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards are composed of qualitative, not quantitative standards and don't establish a particular level of working conditions, wages or [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] standards.&lt;ref name="adb.org"/&gt; They are not intended to undermine the [[comparative advantage]] that [[Developing country|developing countries]] may hold. Core labour standards are important human rights and are recognised in widely ratified human rights instruments including the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC), the most widely ratified human rights treaty with 193 parties, and the ICCPR with 160 parties.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the United Nations [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|High Commissioner for Human Rights]], Ratification and Reservations: [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], {{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/11.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223320/http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/11.htm |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }} Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ratification and Reservations: International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, {{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223320/http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/4.htm |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}   &lt;/ref&gt; The core labour standards are:

*freedom of association:&lt;ref&gt;ICCPR Art.22, [[ILO Convention]] 87&lt;/ref&gt; workers are able to join [[trade union]]s that are independent of government and employer influence
*the right to collective bargaining:&lt;ref&gt;ICCPR Art.22, ILO Convention 98&lt;/ref&gt; workers may negotiate with employers collectively, as opposed to individually
*the prohibition of all forms of forced labour:&lt;ref&gt;ICCPR Art. 8, ILO Conventions 29 and 105&lt;/ref&gt; includes security from [[Penal labour|prison labour]] and slavery, and prevents workers from being forced to work under duress&lt;ref name="Greenfield_9"&gt;Greenfield, G 2001 'Core Labor Standards in the WTO: Reducing labor to a global commodity', Working USA , vol.5, Iss. 1; pp 9&lt;/ref&gt;
*elimination of the worst forms of child labour:&lt;ref&gt;CROC Art. 32 ILO Convention 138&lt;/ref&gt; implementing a minimum [[Legal working age|working age]] and certain working condition requirements for children
*non-discrimination in employment : [[Equal pay for women|equal pay for equal work]].

Most ILO member countries have ratified all of these conventions  - 140 ILO member States have ratified all 8 fundamental Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:10011:5704435115833::::P10011_DISPLAY_BY:2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Barriers to promoting labour standards ==
There are some major roadblocks to the process of recognising core labour standards within the WTO. Firstly, incorporating labour rights into the WTO is not simply a [[question of law]] and economics, but also of politics and ethics. Interplay between states and [[interest group]]s cloud the already complex issue further. Recognising human rights and specifically core labour standards in the WTO raises a series of thorny political, and in some cases moral, questions. Because each state is acting primarily according to its national interest, even technically viable solutions that could benefit the majority may become politicised. The highly democratic nature of the WTO compounds this problem because consensus needs to be reached before any major decisions are made, meaning each country effectively carries the power of veto, sometimes making it difficult to achieve real progress.

Secondly, this issue occurs at the intersection between trade and human rights which raises a series of unique questions. Although the trade and human rights regimes developed alongside each other following WWII, in some ways they are very different. This is because human rights law, unlike other types of international law that are more contractual in nature, governs how states treat their own citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Survey, Economist, 5 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, sovereignty has been a key principle of the international system, with states being free from any higher [[Rational-legal authority|legal authority]] with the entitlement to exclusive, unqualified, and supreme rule within a delimited territory.&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, J. and Smith, S. 2005, The Globalisation of World Politics: An introduction to international relations, 3rd edition, [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] Press&lt;/ref&gt; The atrocities committed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in WWII however resulted in the establishment of a [[International human rights instruments|human rights regime]] where states have a [[responsibility to protect]] the rights of their citizens, and may be subject to international condemnation and even intervention if they fail to do so. Human rights law results in an unprecedented number of controls on domestic behaviour, "challenging the traditional legal concept of state sovereignty".&lt;ref name="Howse_Mutua"&gt;Howse, R &amp; Mutua, M 2000 Protecting Human Rights in a Global Economy: Challenges for the World Trade Organization, {{cite web |url=http://www.ichrdd.ca/english/commdoc/publications/globalization/wtoRightsGlob.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604111607/http://ichrdd.ca/english/commdoc/publications/globalization/wtoRightsGlob.html |archivedate=2009-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Free trade|Trade liberalisation]] on the other hand places constraints on [[domestic policy]] making ability, and the ability of states to fulfil their treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] 1999, Statement of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and [[Cultural rights|Cultural Rights]] to the Third Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, par. 3&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is trade liberalisation that has led developing countries to deregulate in order to attract investment and retain a [[Sustainable competitive advantage|competitive advantage]]. The governments are therefore restricted in providing key workplace rights and satisfying core labour standards. This is known as the 'race to the bottom'.&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"&gt;Eres T 2004 'The Limits of GATT Article XX', Georgetown Journal of International Law, vol. 35, issue 3, pp 597-636&lt;/ref&gt; In simple terms, it is a phenomenon where interstate competition results in the progressive dismantling of regulatory standards, and in this case, those governing labour standards. In order to gain a comparative advantage and attract [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]], countries deregulate which leads to a decrease in working conditions and wages. The [[race to the bottom]] becomes a vicious circle with states competing to deregulate even further resulting in major human rights problems.

Many developing countries express their concern that labour standards will have a deleterious effect on their economy. The comparative wage advantage is an essential part of the world economic order so there is a general opposition to the incorporation of labour standards within the WTO.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Developing countries also hold legitimate fears that the attempts to incorporate labour standards may be used as a thinly veiled protectionist measure. Tariffs can have a devastating effect on a developing economy. Although the threat of [[protectionism]] is valid and justified, in some cases it is just trade language being used to justify heinous human rights abuses such as [[Slavery|slave labour]] and exploitive forms of [[Child labor|child labour]].&lt;ref name="Howse_Mutua"/&gt; The recognition of labour standards in the WTO may "alienate Members who negotiated the agreement with different expectations"&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt;{{rp|619}} and cause further unrest. However a country is unlikely to leave the WTO altogether as the disadvantages of leaving the system would be too great.

== Mechanisms to Incorporate Core Labour Standards into the WTO ==
Taking these tensions into account, there are some possible ways to incorporate core labour standards into the WTO.

===Using the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade===
In theory, it is possible to use existing measures within the WTO to protect certain human rights. Within the WTO Agreements there are general exceptions (GATT Article XX) that can be used for the protection of specific human rights.&lt;ref&gt;"Recognizing that their relations in the field of trade and economic endeavour should be conducted with a view to raising standards of living, ensuring full employment…", Marrakech Agreement preamble&lt;/ref&gt; GATT Article XX paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) can be used to impose unilateral trade restrictive measures on countries&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; for unacceptable labour standards. However, the wording of the exceptions has resulted in extreme difficulty for those who try to invoke trade measures, as is evidenced by 48 years of GATT where no country restricted trade through these sections.&lt;ref name="Aaronson"/&gt;{{rp|1014}} One of the reasons for this is that even when trade restrictive measures are successfully applied to a state, GATT Article 1, the principle of [[most favoured nation]] treatment, comes into play. This prescribes in essence, that any country which treats a state in a particular way then has to grant the same treatment to all other states. In regards to sanctions this means that if [[trade sanctions]] are applied to one country for a certain human rights abuse, they must then be applied to all countries who abuse the same right. This can have massive economic and political ramifications.

The political aspect of GATT Article XX aside, there are technical legal problems involved with invoking the clause in the first place. The wording in the relevant sections of GATT Article XX means that it must be proved that it is "necessary" to restrict a product in order to protect human, animal or plant life or health.&lt;ref&gt;GATT, Art XX (b)&lt;/ref&gt; For a state to legally take unilateral trade restrictive measures under these sections, the 'necessity test' must first be passed. There are three components. Firstly, it must be determined whether the interests protected are vital. Secondly, there is an assessment as to whether or not alternative measures are reasonably available and thirdly it is determined whether these alternate measures are less inconsistent with GATT (are the measures being proposed 'necessary' to combat the risk?). This means that a link must be established between both the targeted risk, the product being targeted and the trade measures being undertaken, with [[Legal burden of proof|the burden of proof]] is solely upon the party seeking to uphold the clause.&lt;ref&gt;US- Gasoline; EC- Asbestos, www.worldtradelaw.net&lt;/ref&gt; According to Black's [[Law dictionary]], 'necessary' does not have to carry the meaning 'indispensable' but can refer to the most appropriate or convenient option.&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; In the Korea- Beef case it was taken to mean 'nearly indispensable',&lt;ref name="WTO_Korea"&gt;WTO [[Appellate Body]] Report, Korea- Measures Affecting Imports of Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Beef, WT/DS161, 169/AB/R, Par 156 (Dec.11, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and this definition has become a benchmark by which other cases are evaluated.&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; Context is very important, and the greater the risk posed by a product the more lenience is granted when proving a link. For example, if there is a danger to human life, the evaluation is less stringent. However it is still extremely difficult to justify cases of labour standards abuse under GATT XX. Even if the necessity test is satisfied, the chapeau to Article XX must also be satisfied- the laws must not be applied in a manner so as to constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination, nor be a disguised restriction on international trade. This last requirement is particularly important because there is often a suspicion that the insertion of labour standards into free trade agreements/other measures, for example, are really disguised restrictions on trade.

Furthermore, the 'necessity test' ensures that only when the products themselves present a threat can they be restricted. Therefore, protecting labour rights through GATT Article XX is impossible, even if the production of the product may threaten human life. For example, the worst forms of child labour are a heinous practice which fall within the Article XX exception (b) yet children cannot be protected under this because it is their work conditions which are harmful, not the products themselves. In order to assist in removing constraints on states' ability to protect labour rights through GATT Article XX, the word 'necessary' should be replaced in Article XX(b) with 'relating to', as is used in GATT XX (c) and (g), or 'involving' as is the wording in (i).&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; In the Korea- Beef case this was decided to be "more flexible textually", not requiring such stringent linkage.&lt;ref name="WTO_Korea"/&gt; This would allow trade measures to be implemented to combat labour standards with more ease, whilst ensuring that the exceptions are not used indiscriminately. However, due to the political concerns expressed above it would be quite difficult to amend the GATT, especially Article XX.

===Incorporation of a [[Social clause]]===
A solution that is widely talked about by some trade unionists and human rights groups is the incorporation of a social clause into the WTO Agreement.&lt;ref name="Greenfield_9"/&gt; Essentially, this means that the core labour standards would inserted into an article within the WTO Agreements which could be a more viable option than amendment of the Agreements themselves. If a state violated the social clause, the breach could become subject to WTO scrutiny, through the usual WTO dispute settlement provisions (provided provision is made for this when inserting a social clause). As a result of dispute settlement proceedings, the DSB could, at the request of the complaining party, recommend that retaliatory trade measures be taken against the offending country.&lt;ref name="Greenfield_9"/&gt; At first glance this might seem to be a good solution, as labour rights could not only be recognised, but enforced within the dispute settlement mechanisms of the WTO.

===Problems with Unilateral Trade Sanctions as an Enforcement Mechanism===
Within the international system it is difficult to enforce international law, particularly with regard to human rights. So using trade sanctions as a coercive measure is an appealing prospect to ensure cooperation. However, there are many reasons why trade sanctions are an inappropriate mechanism for enforcing labour standards. They are generally against WTO principles, and can only be used in very limited circumstances that are authorized by the WTO agreements, such as [[Dumping (pricing policy)|anti-dumping]] and countervailing measures. Politically, it is unlikely that unilateral action would be allowed for breaches of labour standards. Even assuming that labour standards are able to be enforced through trade measures within the WTO, either through amendments to GATT XX, the introduction of a social clause or any other measure, they do not provide a solution to the complexity of the labour standards issue and should not be used to deal with disputes over labour standards.&lt;ref&gt;WTO [[Director-general|Director General]] Renato Ruggeiro, World Trade Organization, 'WTO press brief: Trade and Labour standards' http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min96_e/labstand.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, trade measures have the effect of constraining access to markets, which is why they are effective as a deterrent. However this may be counterproductive, resulting in developing countries becoming even poorer without helping the workers. "Trade sanctions are a blunt instrument, penalizing the country as a whole, not just those responsible for rights violations."&lt;ref name="UNDR_HDP"&gt;United Nations Development Programme, [[Human Development Report]] 2000: Human Rights and [[Human development (humanity)|Human Development]], Chapter 4, http://hdr.undp.org/reports/global/2000/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The linkage and inalienability between civil &amp; political, and economic, social &amp; cultural rights means that without a strong economic foundation, not only ICESCR rights are jeopardised, but ICCPR rights also. For example, in ensuring that [[civil and political rights]] such as the prohibition of [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] are protected, there must be sufficient funds available to legislate against this practice, and monitor and ensure that the legislation is carried out. Therefore, when a country is denied access to global markets, the resulting poverty can mean that the capability of the country to protect human rights is diminished, even if the political will is present. Not only may the government be affected, but individual businesses and workers may experience increased hardship as a result of [[trade barrier]]s. For example, wages may be lowered to retain a competitive edge,&lt;ref name="Flasbarth"&gt;Flasbarth, A. &amp; Lips, M., 'Effects of a Humanitarian World Trade Organization Social Clause on Welfare and North-South Trade flows', Aussenwirtschaft, Jun 2006, vol. 62 iss. 2 pp. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the direct opposite of the intended effect of the sanctions.

Secondly, social clauses and the resulting sanctions are only applicable to export sectors. This causes considerable problems. For example, if sanctions were applied to the export sector because of the use of child labour, affected children would simply move into employment opportunities in the non-export sector (assuming full labour moveability).&lt;ref name="Flasbarth"/&gt; Working in the unregulated and non-accountable 'shadow economy' can lead to even worse conditions and human rights abuses. Studies show that child labour in the export sector is only 5% of overall child labour.&lt;ref name="UNDR_HDP"/&gt;{{rp|14}} Therefore, sanctions may not improve the situation at all and may force children into even worse working conditions. Because sanctions only apply to exported goods, abuse of core labour standards can occur domestically with few legal repercussions. One of the core conventions, that condemning forced labour, is blatantly violated in the US where prison inmates make [[Product (business)|commercial products]].&lt;ref name="Greenfield_9"/&gt; However, because they are supplied solely to the [[domestic market]], the WTO does not have jurisdiction and trade sanctions cannot be applied.&lt;ref name="Greenfield_9"/&gt;

Thirdly, poor labour standards are usually rooted in poverty and this is not something that sanctions can solve. If the [[root cause]] of the problem is not addressed and the a worker loses their job because of a heavy handed approach such as trade measures resulting in mass lay-offs, the family may lose its income and be plunged into greater poverty.

Furthermore, sanctions have the potential be used in an unfair way or for protectionist purposes. One reason for this is because when the DSB rules that trade sanctions are allowed in response to a violation of one of the agreements, it is up to the wronged country to choose what products it will restrict. This has seen the US restrict a variety of imports from [[European Union|the EU]] including telecommunications products and cheese, after winning a case in the WTO over bananas.&lt;ref name="Greenfield_9"/&gt; This is different from GATT XX in that the targeted product does not have to be directly related to the perceived threat. The problem with the indiscriminate restrictions of products is that it gives the complainant a huge amount of power which could lead to protectionism. Trade penalties can have a much larger effect on developing countries than developed. Although legally they have the same power as other nations, developing countries are at a disadvantage when it comes to pursuing trade measures because unilateral trade measures often have deleterious consequences for the punishing country as well as the offender.&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; In addition, hostile regimes can gain control of the [[black market]] and charge exorbitant prices.&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; Trade sanctions are not necessarily an effective way to deal with "wayward" governments as it simply gives them greater control of the countries resources.

===Furtherance of the WTO and ILO Relationship===
Although not a suitable long term solution, a way to break the current deadlock would be to further institutionalise the relationship between the WTO and ILO. The WTO Secretariat has some restricted interaction with the ILO "compiling statistics, research and technical assistance and training".&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, 'Work with other organisations: The WTO and International Labour Organization', http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/coher_e/wto_ilo_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Originally however, the ITO was supposed to have a strong working relationship with the ILO and "consult and co-operate" in all labour related matters, as well as cooperating in regards [[economic development]] and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Final Act of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment: Havana Charter for an International Trade Organisation Havana Charter, Art 7:3 and Art. 10, http://www.worldtradelaw.net/misc/havana.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The current system is but a shadow of this, with very limited collaboration. When the issue of labour standards was raised at the 1996 Singapore Ministerial conference, Article 4 of the resultant Ministerial Declaration ruled that "the WTO and ILO Secretariats will continue their existing collaboration".&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization 1996 'Singapore WTO Ministerial 1996: Ministerial Declaration WT/NIM(96)/DEC, http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min96_e/wtodec_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Chairman of the Singapore Ministerial Conference Yeo Chow Tong later clarified in his concluding remarks that this collaboration "respects fully the respective and separate mandates of the two organisations".&lt;ref&gt;Par 8 Concluding remarks by H.E. Mr. [[Yeo Cheow Tong]] {{cite web |url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/tong-cn.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201142228/http://www.twnside.org.sg./title/tong-cn.htm |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Geneva Ministerial Conference, the US, EU and [[South Africa]] pushed again for a more substantive relationship between the two organisations which was opposed by a group of developing countries, led by Brazil. But despite the amount of controversy and discussion about the issue, the Ministerial Declaration failed to make a mention of it.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

The obvious reluctance of the WTO to deal with labour standards and the unlikelihood of recognition in this field in the near future means that the link between the WTO and ILO is crucial in regulating labour standards.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; However this relationship has never been formalised within the WTO and so will remain ineffective at best without proactive change. Within the Agreement Establishing the WTO, Article III 'Functions of the WTO' Par. 5 of reads: "With a view to achieving greater coherence in global economic policy-making, the WTO shall cooperate, as appropriate, with the International Monetary Fund and with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and its affiliated agencies." The ILO should be inserted into this section. Furthermore, in order to establish a formal, more meaningful relationship, a Ministerial Declaration should be written acknowledging the high level of cooperation and interconnectedness of the organisations, similar to the Ministerial Declarations regarding the relationship with the IMF and World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Uruguay Round, Relationship of the World Trade Organization with the International Monetary Fund.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this relationship is that the ILO would not be undermined by the WTO, maintaining its authority in regards to labour standards. The mandates of each organisation would be respected, and there would be no recourse to trade sanctions whilst maintaining a degree of basic protection for labour rights.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Collaboration between the ILO and WTO should also make use of the joint research facilities available, and a series of reports on labour rights should be created, similar to the ILO and WTO report "Joint Study on Trade and Employment",&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, '2007 News Items: WTO and Other Organisations', http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news07_e/ilo_feb07_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but with a focus on labour standards. In the thinking of ILO Director General Michel Hansenne in the aftermath of the Singapore Ministerial Conference, a good working relationship could be established by pressuring states to ratify the relevant ILO conventions comprising the core labour standards.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; A scheme was established where those states who do not choose to ratify have to present a brief every 4 years "showing the extent to which effect has been given, or is proposed to be given, to any of the provisions of the Convention by legislation, administrative action, collective agreement or otherwise and stating the difficulties which prevent or delay the ratification of such Convention".&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization, 'Constitution' Art. 19.5 (e)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ILO is unable to enforce labour standards and can simply make recommendations, relying on moral suasion,&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Hansenne's scheme once improved could lead to increased transparency and lead to regular discussion about labour standards, which is obviously to be desired. More regular reports, and increased pressure on non-ratifying state are necessary. Following the Singapore Ministerial Conference Hansenne further opined that it would be beneficial if a complaints committee were set up which could recommend that
(a) A case does not require further consideration
(b) The offending government rectify the labour standards abuse
(c) The matter be referred to the Fact-finding and Conciliation Commission of the ILO with the agreement of the offending government.
Unfortunately, the committee idea failed to gain support.

It has been suggested that another way in which to increase the importance of the relationship between the WTO and ILO is that countries wishing to join the organisation must first ratify the relevant ILO convention. Within the WTO, existing members set the standards of accession. However this use of [[double standard]]s is completely unjust, and does nothing to address the labour standard abuses of existing members. This is still no way of coercing uncooperative states into respecting core standards, and not including labour standards expressly within the WTO has the possible result of sidelining the issue&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; and so is no means an [[ideal solution]], but remains a worthy first step.

===Increased Civil Society Participation===
One suggestion for the improvement of the WTO system is to allow for increased [[civil society]] participation. This would result in the centralisation of [[social issues]], and within this, core labour standards. Furthermore, civil society groups are in an ideal position to put pressure on governments to uphold their human rights commitments, and monitor any progress in this field. Within civil society, [[Non-governmental organization|Non-Government Organisations]] (NGOs) would play a particularly crucial role. The term NGO passed into popular usage in the early 1970s and has come to mean a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit organisation]] that has specific objectives that is independent from the government, non-criminal, [[Nonviolence|non-violent]], not a political party.&lt;ref&gt;Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, Monash University&lt;/ref&gt; Within the UN under Article 71 there are 2,350 (2004) NGOs with [[Consultative Status|consultative status]]. This successful system has set a precedent for formalised NGO participation and should be used as a model for the WTO. There is provision for NGO participation within the WTO already under Article 5:2 'Relations with Other Organisations of the Marrakech Agreement': "The General Council may make appropriate arrangements for consultation and cooperation with non-governmental organizations concerned with matters related to those of the WTO". The WTO is a strictly [[International organization|intergovernmental organisation]], which means that civil society has no direct input, and much decision-making takes place behind closed doors. This system is appropriate when dealing with tariff reduction issues, but as large scale protests outside WTO meetings continue to demonstrate, social issues which concern civil society at large are forming a part of the WTO agenda. Globalisation means that decisions made at the WTO have come to affect everyone's lives, and hence there has been an increase in interest in the goings-on of the WTO by civil society. Allowing NGOs to have a say could increase transparency of the system, put pressure on non-compliant governments and provide specialist knowledge and support. Many organisations such as Oxfam, the [[International Confederation of Trade Unions]] and One World have already investigated the link between trade and labour standards- it does not make sense to ignore their expertise in this field. Unlike many domestic judicial systems, the WTO does not allow public scrutiny of proceedings, and it is this, rather than lack of any textual mechanism, that impedes NGO involvement.&lt;ref name="Howse_Mutua"/&gt; Forums are an effective way to allow NGOs to express their opinion and present information and regular forums should be held to discuss current, relevant issues. This idea has certainly won some support. In the aftermath of the Geneva Ministerial Conference in 1998, [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Bill Clinton]] said that "The WTO was created to lift the lives of ordinary citizens', it should listen to them. I propose the WTO, for the first time, provide a forum where business, labour, environmental and consumer groups can speak out and help guide further evolution of the WTO. When this body convenes again, I believe that the world's trade ministers should sit down with representatives of the broad public to begin this discussion".&lt;ref name="Clinton"&gt;Clinton, W, Remarks by the President to Opening Ceremony of the 1998 International Monetary Fund/ World Bank Annual Meeting, [[News release|media release]], http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/New/html/19981006-4644.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is not only NGOs who should have increased participation, but expert UN human rights bodies who are also highly proficient in exploring the trade and human rights intersection. For example, the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights has regrettably not been included in WTO processes.&lt;ref name="Clinton"/&gt;

===Recognition within the WTO Preamble===
One of the first steps to enforcing core labour standards is to acknowledge them explicitly within the WTO. Specific amendments to the body of the agreements on how to include labour standards within the WTO will take time as there are myriad proposed ways in which to do this. Therefore, incorporating the importance of labour standards into the preamble of the Agreement Establishing the WTO is an important action- with both symbolic and legal value. Although this does not place any binding obligations upon states to take immediate action on the labour standards issue, it can be used for the purposes of interpretation according to the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]]: "The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text... its preamble and annexes".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations 1969, 'Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties', Art. 31.2&lt;/ref&gt; There are oblique references to human rights already within the WTO preamble, but more explicit recognition is desirable. The importance of the preamble has been recognised by the Appellate Body report in many cases&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, 'WTO Analytical Index: Marrakesh Agreement' http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/wto_agree_01_e.htm#pB&lt;/ref&gt; so if labour rights were inserted into the preamble, the DSB when interpreting the agreements would be forced to take the preamble into account, and decisions with more favourable conclusions for labour rights would hopefully be passed down. So although this measure seems ineffective, once consensus has been established to include labour standards, this is one of the first steps that should be taken.

Incorporation of core labour standards into the preamble would also lead to the examination of human rights abuses through existing WTO review mechanisms. In 1988 the decision was made to make regular reviews of state's trade policy conducted by the WTO, a key part of the transparency of the organisation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;World Trade Organization, 'Understanding the WTO: The Agreements. Trade policy reviews: ensuring transparency', http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm11_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Governments submit information to the WTO Secretariat who issue a report which is then examined by the General Council sitting as the Trade Policy Review Body. Government policies are reviewed in relation to the "functioning of the multilateral trading system" so as to encourage adherence to commitments under the agreements, and greater transparency.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, 'Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization', Annex 3 Par. A&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the reviews are focusing solely upon the issue of trade liberalisation, and whether a member's policies support this. Although free trade is an important issue, it is not the overall objective of the multilateral trading system and should not be examined to the exclusion of all else. The real objectives of the WTO, with the aim of "raising standards of living, [and] ensuring full employment…"&lt;ref name="wto.org"/&gt; are conspicuously ignored. If labour rights were incorporated into the Marrakech Agreement Preamble, it would be even easier to address labour standards through the trade policy review mechanism.

One of the problems with the system is that the member state has the responsibility to supply the information to the WTO Secretariat. With no one checking on them, this could lead to problems however NGOs could play an important role in overcoming this. A second issue is that the regularity of reviews is calculated by a state's share of world trade. This means that the top 4 countries (the "Quad"): US, EU, Japan and Canada must review their policy every 2 years. The next 16 countries must submit reviews every four years and developing countries every 6 years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although the system may work currently, when it comes to human rights this is a problem. This is because the labour standards and human rights abuses of developing countries are no less egregious than those in [[Developed country|developed countries]] and so do not deserve to be monitored any less. Each state should have to submit a report addressing the "real" objectives of the WTO every 2 years or so, as well as a report addressing trade liberalisation according to the current system. By reporting on labour standards, the issue is opened to discussion, which can only be positive. Although states are not forced to act on any labour standards abuses that may be found within their territories, the public acknowledgement of their existence could provide fuel for human rights groups and victims. The very act of raising the labour standards issue is the first step because the power of shame should never be underestimated.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Survey, 'The power of shame', Economist, 5 December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malan's triangles''' – comprising the ''triangle of conflict'' and the ''triangle of persons'' – were developed in 1979 by the psychotherapist [[David Malan (psychotherapist)|David Malan]] as a way of illuminating the phenomenon of [[transference]] in psychotherapy, both brief and extended.

Their application has continued to prove fruitful into the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;J. Grant.J. Crawley, ''Transference and Projection'' (2002) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
As Malan himself acknowledged, he drew the concept of his triangles from previous analytic writings (albeit combining in the process very different aspects of the tradition).  The American Freudian [[Karl Menninger]] - building on [[Franz Alexander]]'s concept of the totalizing transference interpretation, which linked past experience, life context and the analytic setting – set out what he called the triangle of insight,&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Malan, ''Towards the Validation of Dynamic Psychotherapy'' (2012) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; involving the three poles of analyst, past significant others, and present significant others.  This triangle Malan renamed as the triangle of persons.

Malan derived his second triangle from his [[Tavistock Clinic]] colleague, the [[Melanie Klein|Kleinian]] group therapist [[Henry Ezriel]].  Ezriel had used a three-tiered interpretation for identifying  members' attitudes to the group – the required (surface) attitude, the wished-for attitude, and the catastrophic attitude (a traumatic expectation, fear of which helped turn the wished-for attitude into the required or conformist attitude).&lt;ref&gt;H. Spandler, ''Asylum to Action'' (2006) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;  Simplified, Ezriel's three tiers became Malan's triangle of conflict, comprising defence, impulse and anxiety.

==Usage==
Malan's achievement was to place these very differently-sourced triangles in juxtaposition, the one to illuminate intra-psychic processes, the other the inter-personal.   Malan himself claimed that “between them they can be used to represent almost every intervention that a therapist makes...skill consists in knowing which part of which triangle to include at any given moment”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Grant.J. Crawley, ''Transference and Projection'' (2002) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Both triangles should be imagined as inverted, standing on their apex – which in the one consisted of the unconscious impulse, in the other of early childhood links to the parents.  Much interpretation using the triangles concerns illuminating defences and current relationships, with reference to the unconscious feelings and personal transferences underlying them.&lt;ref&gt;J. Grant.J. Crawley, ''Transference and Projection'' (2002) p. 124-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have warned of the danger of the mechanical, the overly-intellectual application of Malan's triangles in actual practice.&lt;ref&gt;G. Mander, ''A Psychodynamic Approach to Brief Therapy'' (2000) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Management science''' ('''MS'''), is the broad interdisciplinary study of problem solving and decision making in human organizations, with strong links to [[management]], [[economics]], [[business]], [[engineering]], [[management consulting]], and other [[sciences]]. It uses various scientific [[research]]-based [[principles]], [[strategies]], and [[analytical method]]s including  [[mathematical model]]ing, [[statistics]] and [[numerical algorithm]]s to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and accurate [[management]] decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems.  Management sciences help businesses to achieve goals using various scientific methods. 

The field was initially an outgrowth of [[applied mathematics]], where early challenges were problems relating to the [[optimization]] of systems which could be modeled linearly, i.e., determining the optima ([[Maxima and minima|maximum]] value of [[profit (accounting)|profit]], assembly line performance, [[crop yield]], bandwidth, etc. or [[Maxima and minima|minimum]] of loss, risk, costs, etc.) of some objective function. Today, management science encompasses any organizational activity for which the problem can be structured as a functional system so as to obtain a solution set with identifiable characteristics.

== Overview ==
Management science is concerned with a number of different areas of study: One is developing and applying [[scientific modeling|model]]s and [[concept]]s that may prove useful in helping to illuminate [[management]] issues and solve managerial problems. The models used can often be represented mathematically, but sometimes computer-based, [[visual]] or [[Speech|verbal]] representations are used as well or instead.&lt;ref name= "LS"&gt; [http://www.lums.lancs.ac.uk/departments/ManSci/DeptProfile/WhatisManSci/ What is Management Science?] Lancaster University, 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Another area is designing and developing new and better models of organizational excellence. 

Management science research can be done on three levels:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mphil_mgtscience/mgtresearch.html What is Management Science Research?] University of Cambridge 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fundamental level lies in three mathematical disciplines: [[probability]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], and [[dynamical systems theory]].
* The modeling level is about building models, analyzing them mathematically, gathering and analyzing data, implementing models on computers, solving them, experimenting with them&amp;mdash;all this is part of management science research on the modeling level. This level is mainly instrumental, and driven mainly by [[statistics]] and [[econometrics]]. 
* The application level, just as in any other [[engineering]] and [[economics]] disciplines, strives to make a practical impact and be a driver for change in the real world.

The management scientist's mandate is to use rational, systematic, science-based techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds. The techniques of management science are not restricted to business applications but may be applied to [[military]], medical, [[public administration]], charitable groups, political groups or community groups.

== History ==
Its origins can be traced to [[operations research]], which made its debut during [[World War II]] when the Allied forces recruited scientists of various disciplines to assist with military operations. In these early applications, the scientists utilized simple mathematical models to make efficient use of limited technologies and resources. The application of these models within the corporate sector became known as management science.&lt;ref name="UTK"&gt; [http://bus.utk.edu/soms/information/whatis_msci.html What is Management Science?] The University of Tennessee, 2006. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1967 [[Stafford Beer]] characterized the field of management science as "the business use of operations research".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stafford Beer]] (1967). ''Management Science: The Business Use of Operations Research''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Some of the fields that management science involves include:  
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
* [[Data mining]]
* [[Decision analysis]] 
* [[Engineering]]
* [[Forecasting]] 
* [[Game theory]]
* [[Industrial engineering]]
* [[Logistics]]
* [[Mathematical modeling]]
* [[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]]
* [[Probability and statistics]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Psychology]]
* [[Simulation]]
* [[Social network]] / [[Transportation forecasting]] models
* [[Sociology]]
* [[Supply chain management]] 
* [[Management Consulting]] 
{{div col end}}
as well as many others.

== Applications ==
Applications of management science are abundant in industry as [[airlines]], manufacturing companies, [[service organization]]s, military branches, and in [[government]]. The range of problems and issues to which management science has contributed insights and solutions is vast. It includes:.&lt;ref name= "LS"/&gt;
* [[scheduling]] airlines, both planes and crew 
* deciding the appropriate place to site new facilities such as a warehouse or factory 
* managing the flow of water from reservoirs 
* identifying possible future development paths for parts of the telecommunications industry 
* establishing the information needs and appropriate systems to supply them within the health service 
* identifying and understanding the strategies adopted by companies for their [[information system]]s

Management science  is also concerned with so-called "soft-operational analysis", which concerns methods for [[strategic planning]], strategic [[decision support]], and [[problem structuring methods]] (PSM). At this level of abstraction, mathematical modeling and simulation will not suffice. Therefore, during the past 30 years, a number of non-quantified modelling methods have been developed. These include [[morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]] and various forms of [[influence diagram]]s.

'''Neal Asbury''' (born May 2, 1957) is an [[United States|American]] [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] and Chief Executive of The Legacy Companies. In addition to being an [[advocate]] of [[entrepreneurship]] and [[free enterprise]], he is a [[published]] [[author]], and he hosts the nationally syndicated talk radio show ''Neal Asbury's Truth for America'' (''now Neal Asbury's Made in America'').

==Early life==
Neal Asbury attended [[Jefferson Township High School (New Jersey)|Jefferson Township High School]] in [[Jefferson Township, New Jersey]]. After graduation he enrolled in Rowan University in [[New Jersey]]. Neal graduated from [[Rowan University]] in 1979 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox News "Interview" on Federal Funding for Video Games|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e80_1305997846|work = [[Fox News]] | accessdate = 2011-06-06 | date = 2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After graduating from [[Rowan State University]] Neal began working in the mail room of a [[Fifth Avenue]] as a food service exporter. A year later, Asbury moved on to Manila, working as a director of sales for a large trading company and traveling to capitals throughout the Far East. Seven years later, he founded [[Asbury Worldwide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Neyman | first = Julie | title = Business is cooking for one local food service equipment exporter - South Florida Business Journal | work = South Florida Business Journal | accessdate = 2010-08-02 | date = 2008-05-02 | url = http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2008/05/05/story11.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Asbury Worldwide grew to include twelve distribution facilities around the globe.  In 1989, Neal began FAB Asia, Inc. in [[Manila]], Philippines which was the Asian fabricator of commercial kitchens for McDonald's as well as other [[United States|American]] restaurant chains.

After selling his group of companies in July 1999, Mr. Asbury established [[Greenfield World Trade]] which is a global trading company selling and servicing American manufactured products in over 130 countries to both the retail and commercial markets. He acquired J. Cobo (a distribution company with operations throughout Latin America), General (a manufacturer of food preparation equipment), Zeroll (a manufacturer of kitchen gadgets), and Omega (a manufacturer of electrical kitchen appliances).

==Awards and Distinctions==

'''Nexcelle''' is a [[joint venture]] between [[GE Aviation]]’s [http://www.mras-usa.com ''Middle River Aircraft Systems''] and [[Safran]] Nacelles – both of which are suppliers of engine [[nacelle]]s, [[thrust reverser]]s and [[aerostructures]].

Headquartered in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], Nexcelle has teamed with its parent companies to develop, produce and support integrated propulsion systems for jet engine applications on single-aisle jetliners and business aircraft.&lt;ref name="ref 8"/&gt;

With its initial program win, Nexcelle is positioned as a key partner on the world’s first truly integrated propulsion system, the [[CFM International]] LEAP-1C engine on China’s COMAC C919 jetliner. The joint venture subsequently was selected to provide the nacelle and thrust reverser for GE’s Passport integrated propulsion system, which powers the [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] [[Bombardier Global Express|Global 7000]] and [[Bombardier Global Express|Global 8000]] business jets.&lt;ref name="ref 15"/&gt;

==History==
[[GE Aviation]] and [[Safran]] announced an agreement on a new nacelle joint venture on July 15, 2008 at the [[Farnborough Airshow]] in [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], England.&lt;ref name="ref 3"/&gt; Nexcelle was announced as the name of the new company on September 21, 2009.&lt;ref name="ref 4"/&gt;

On June 14, 2009, the appointment of Steve Walters as Nexcelle president was announced at the [[Paris Air Show]]. Walters had worked in various engineering and leadership roles, with the majority of his career at GE – including two of his most recent roles as director of Business Operations for the [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]] engine program and the airfoils business Quality and Compliance leader for [[GE Aviation]].&lt;ref name="ref 6"/&gt;

Also at the 2009 [[Paris Air Show]], Nexcelle’s cooperative nacelle systems agreement with [[CFM International]] was detailed. This accord covers the development and production of integrated propulsion systems for potential new applications for CFM engines.&lt;ref name="ref 7"/&gt;

Michel J. Abella was announced as the Director of Programs at Nexcelle on December 18, 2009.&lt;ref name="ref 1"/&gt;

In December, 2009, Nexcelle became a partner on the world's first truly integrated propulsion system. The company was selected to provide a combined nacelle, thrust reverser and exhaust system for the new [[CFM International]] [[CFM International LEAP-X|LEAP-1C]] engine selected as the sole western powerplant to launch [[China]]’s [[COMAC C919]] jetliner. Nexcelle’s contribution to [[CFM International LEAP-X|LEAP-1C]] on the [[COMAC C919|C919]] includes an innovative nacelle design that is produced with a significant percentage of composites, and which incorporates advanced acoustic treatment. It also is to be equipped with an Electrical Thrust Reverser Actuation System (ETRAS).&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt;

[[File:Nexcelle PANACHE.jpg|thumb|The Nexcelle PANACHE thrust reverser demonstrator is deployed during testing at GE Aviation’s Peebles, Ohio facility. An anti-ingestion tunnel protects the CFM56-5C testbed engine against FOD ([[foreign object damage]]) during thrust reverse. (May 16, 2012)]]

In October 2010, GE selected Nexcelle to provide the nacelle and thrust reverser for the GE Passport 20 engine to be used on [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]]’s new [[Bombardier Global Express|Global 7000]] and [[Bombardier Global Express|Global 8000]] business jets. The announcement was made at the [[National Business Aviation Association|NBAA]] Annual Meeting and Convention.&lt;ref name="ref 9"/&gt; At the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 2011, Nexcelle signed the purchase agreement for its supply of the [[General Electric Passport|GE Passport]] 20’s nacelle system to [[GE Aviation]].&lt;ref name="ref 10"/&gt;

Nexcelle’s presence at the 2011 [[Paris Air Show]] also included a functional half-scale model demonstrating key elements of the company’s integrated propulsion system concepts for jet engines on airliners.&lt;ref name="ref 11"/&gt;

In January 2012, Nexcelle announced the appointment of Huntley Myrie as its new president – succeeding the company’s first president, Steve Walters, who moved on to become the product leader for [[GE Aviation]]’s nacelle and aerostructures activities.&lt;ref name="ref 12"/&gt;

Nexcelle began full-scale testing of its nacelle demonstrator – called PANACHE (Pylon And Nacelle Advanced Configuration for High Efficiency) – in May 2012, marking a first validation of the thrust reverser element for the company’s Integrated Propulsion System technology. This activity occurred at GE Aviation’s Peebles Test Operation in Ohio, and it involved 200 cycles representing normal deployments, rejected take-off deployments and aborted landings.&lt;ref name="ref 13"/&gt;

Michel Abella was appointed president of Nexcelle in August 2013. Ken Onderko took over the role in December 2016.&lt;ref name="ref 15"/&gt;

==Promax and Broadcast Design Association==
Promax was established in 1956 as a non-profit association for promotion and marketing professionals working in broadcast media. In 1997, The Broadcast Design Association (BDA) who had partnered with Promax for years on their annual conference, officially joined with Promax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promaxbda.org/about.asp?n=promaxbda|publisher=PromaxBDA|accessdate=2009-04-19|title=WHO IS PROMAX·BDA?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419223450/http://www.promaxbda.org/about.asp?n=promaxbda|archivedate=2009-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PromaxBDA awards replaced earlier awards presented separately by Promax and the Broadcast Designers Association (BDA). Thousands of PromaxBDA awards have been presented to [[Company (law)|companies]] and [[individual]]s whose work is judged by a panel of [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] and [[marketing]] professionals using three measures: overall creativity, production quality, and results in achieving marketing objectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">The '''Rapaport Price List''', also known as the "Rap List" is the [[diamond industry]] standard for the pricing of diamonds.

==History==
The first Rapaport Price List was produced by [[Martin Rapaport]], the Rapaport Diamonds Group founder, in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Industry’s Benchmark: Rapaport Price list |url=https://en.israelidiamond.co.il/wikidiamond/diamond-industry-history/benchmark-rapaport-price-list/ |website=The Israeli Diamond Insustry |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==How it works==
The report is updated every week on Thursday, at 11:59pm EST.  The Rapaport Price List is [[Copyright|copyrighted]] and available only to subscribers. Jewelers and diamond merchants use it to set prices for consumers. Consumers should therefore use the report with caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Traps with Raps |url=https://www.pricescope.com/wiki/wholesale-diamonds/traps_with_raps |website=PriceScope |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These prices are used as the basis for standardization and negotiation of diamond prices around the world. Many of the agreed upon prices in diamond trade are come to from discounts based on the Rapaport Price List.  

==What is the report based on?==
The report is issued in the form of a table and prices diamonds based on their [[Carat (mass)|size]], [[Diamond color|color]] and [[Diamond clarity|clarity]]. The report provides prices for individual diamonds and not diamonds sold in bulk.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title=Learn How to Calculate Diamond Prices So You Don’t Get Ripped Off &amp; Overpay |url=https://www.diamonds.pro/education/diamond-prices/ |website=The Diamond Pro |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How to read the report==
Each price list has four separate grids each one containing information for a different carat size for diamonds.  Each grid has the clarity options on the horizontal line and the color options on the vertical line.  In order to calculate the price of a diamond according to the Rapaport Price List, you need to know the size, color and clarity of the diamond.  The price listed based on this information is in hundreds of dollars per carat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2964">The '''registrar''' is a Chief Executive officer of a judicial forum. They are the in charge of the entire registry of the department.

In [[common law]] jurisdictions, registrars are usually judicial officers with the power to hear certain civil matters such as interlocutory applications and assessment of damages.  In some jurisdictions they may also hear trials of cases if both parties consent.&lt;ref&gt;See for example in New Zealand http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/m/media-guide-for-reporting-the-courts-and-tribunals-edition-3.1/3-0-key-participants-for-media-in-the-court/3-2-court-registrar&lt;/ref&gt;  Registrars are assisted by Deputy-Registrars, who in [[common law]] jurisdictions are sometime called [[Master (judiciary) |masters]].&lt;ref&gt;For example in England and Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt;


The Registrar is the chief administrator of the department, normally they happen to be the Head of the Department. The posts of the Registrar are generally created in judicial forum like tribunals, High Courts and Supreme Court and in educational universities. In judicial forum they manage both administrative and judicial sides in departments under the authority of the president/Chairman of the tribunals and Chief justices of the High Courts and Supreme Court. The Government may also appoint one or more Assistant/Deputy Registrars. They help the Courts, the Registrar, the President/Chairman and the Judges in all their official/ judicial functions. They are exercising delegated powers of the Registrar. They are Guardian of the Seals and responsible for the Court's archives and publications. 

The Registrar is responsible for the administrative and  few judicial work as are assigned by the President/ Chairman/Judges of the tribunal/Court. In the event of necessities the Registrar may pass interlocutory orders for staying the proceedings as he deems fit until the appeal is heard by the other courts.

In other jurisdictions, the Registrar exercises his powers with the change of nomenclature. Normally, the status of the Registrar is equal to that of the District Judge of Higher Judicial Service.

==Hong Kong==

The court's Registrar, Senior Deputy Registrars and Deputy Registrars serve as [[Master (judiciary)|Masters]] of the High Court in civil trials in the Court of First Instance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/2001/ehtml/03/03-08f.htm 2001 Hong Kong Government Year Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singapore==

The Supreme Court Registry is currently headed by the Registrar of the Supreme Court. He is assisted by the Deputy Registrar, Senior Assistant Registrars and the Assistant Registrars who perform judicial functions. Certain civil proceedings in the High Court, which are heard in chambers, are dealt with by the Registrars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=40 Singapore Supreme Court website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60529">'''Scenario planning''', also called '''scenario thinking''' or '''scenario analysis''', is a [[strategic planning]] method that some organizations use to make flexible long-term plans&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Iterative lagged asymmetric responses in strategic management and long-range planning. Time &amp; Society, OnlineFirst, https://doi.org/10.1177/0961463X17752652 .
&lt;/ref&gt;. It is in large part an adaptation and generalization of classic methods used by [[military intelligence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradfield|first=Ron|last2=Wright|first2=George|last3=Burt|first3=George|last4=Cairns|first4=George|last5=Heijden|first5=Kees Van Der|title=The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016328705000042|journal=Futures|volume=37|issue=8|pages=795–812|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2005.01.003|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The original method was that a group of analysts would generate [[simulation game]]s for [[policy maker]]s. The methods combine known facts about the future, such as [[demographics]], [[geography]], [[military]], [[politics|political]], [[industry|industrial]] information, and [[mineral reserve]]s, with key driving forces identified by considering social, technical, economic, environmental, and political (STEEP) trends&lt;ref&gt;Amer, M., Daim, T.U. and Jetter, A., 2013. A review of scenario planning. Futures, 46, pp.23-40.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In business applications, the emphasis on gaming the behavior of opponents was reduced (shifting more toward a game against nature). At [[Royal Dutch/Shell]] for example, scenario planning was viewed as changing mindsets about the exogenous part of the world, prior to formulating specific strategies&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2013/05/living-in-the-futures|title=Living in the Futures|date=2013-05-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schoemaker|first=Paul J. H.|date=1993-03-01|title=Multiple scenario development: Its conceptual and behavioral foundation|journal=Strategic Management Journal|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=193–213|doi=10.1002/smj.4250140304|issn=1097-0266}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Scenario planning may involve aspects of [[systems thinking]], specifically the recognition that many factors may combine in complex ways to create sometime surprising futures (due to non-linear [[feedback loop]]s)&lt;ref&gt;Grösser, S.N. and Schaffernicht, M., 2012. Mental models of dynamic systems: taking stock and looking ahead. System dynamics review, 28(1), pp.46-68.&lt;/ref&gt;. The method also allows the inclusion of factors that are difficult to formalize, such as novel insights about the future, deep shifts in values, unprecedented regulations or inventions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendonça|first=Sandro|last2=Cunha|first2=Miguel Pina e|last3=Ruff|first3=Frank|last4=Kaivo-oja|first4=Jari|title=Venturing into the Wilderness|journal=Long Range Planning|volume=42|issue=1|pages=23–41|doi=10.1016/j.lrp.2008.11.001|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Systems thinking used in conjunction with scenario planning leads to plausible scenario storylines because the causal relationship between factors can be demonstrated &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gausemeier|first=Juergen|last2=Fink|first2=Alexander|last3=Schlake|first3=Oliver|title=Scenario Management|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=59|issue=2|pages=111–130|doi=10.1016/s0040-1625(97)00166-2|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In these cases when scenario planning is integrated with a systems thinking approach to scenario development, it is sometimes referred to as [[dynamic scenarios]].

==Crafting scenarios==
These combinations and permutations of fact and related social changes are called "[[scenario]]s". The scenarios usually include plausible, but unexpectedly important situations and problems that exist in some small form in the present day. Any particular scenario is unlikely. However, [[future studies]] analysts select scenario features so they are both possible and uncomfortable. Scenario planning help policy-makers and firms to anticipate change, prepare a response and create more robust strategies&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehr|first=Thomas|last2=Lorenz|first2=Ullrich|last3=Willert|first3=Markus|last4=Rohrbeck|first4=René|title=Scenario-based strategizing: Advancing the applicability in strategists' teams|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=124|pages=214–224|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2017.06.026|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ringland|first=Gill|title=The role of scenarios in strategic foresight|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=77|issue=9|pages=1493–1498|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2010.06.010|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Scenarios help a firm to anticipate the impact of different scenarios identify weaknesses. When disclosed years in advance, these weaknesses can be avoided or their impacts reduced more effectively than if similar real-life problems were considered under duress of an emergency. For example, a company may discover that it needs to change contractual terms to protect against a new class of risks, or collect cash reserves to purchase anticipated technologies or equipment. Flexible [[business continuity planning|business continuity plans]] with "[[Systems thinking|PREsponse protocols]]" help cope with similar  operational problems and deliver measurable future value-added.

===Zero-sum game scenarios===
Strategic military intelligence organizations also construct scenarios. The methods and organizations are almost identical, except that scenario planning is applied to a wider variety of problems than merely military and political problems.

As in military intelligence, the chief challenge of scenario planning is to find out the real needs of policy-makers, when policy-makers may not themselves know what they need to know, or may not know how to describe the information that they really want.

Good analysts design [[Military simulation|wargames]] so that policy makers have great flexibility and freedom to adapt their simulated organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwarz|first=Jan Oliver|title=Business wargaming for teaching strategy making|journal=Futures|volume=51|pages=59–66|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2013.06.002|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Then these simulated organizations are "stressed" by the scenarios as a game plays out. Usually, particular groups of facts become more clearly important. These insights enable intelligence organizations to refine and repackage real information more precisely to better serve the policy-makers' real-life needs. Usually the games' simulated time runs hundreds of times faster than real life, so policy-makers experience several years of policy decisions, and their simulated effects, in less than a day.

This chief value of scenario planning is that it allows policy-makers to make and learn from mistakes without risking career-limiting failures in real life. Further, policymakers can make these mistakes in a safe, unthreatening, game-like environment, while responding to a wide variety of concretely presented situations based on facts. This is an opportunity to "rehearse the future", an opportunity that does not present itself in day-to-day operations where every action and decision counts.

==How military scenario planning or scenario thinking is done==
# ''Decide on the key question to be answered by the analysis.'' By doing this, it is possible to assess whether scenario planning is preferred over the other methods. If the question is based on small changes or a very small number of elements, other more formalized methods may be more useful.
# ''Set the time and scope of the analysis.'' Take into consideration how quickly changes have happened in the past, and try to assess to what degree it is possible to predict common trends in demographics, product life cycles. A usual timeframe can be five to 10 years.
# ''Identify major stakeholders.'' Decide who will be affected and have an interest in the possible outcomes. Identify their current interests, whether and why these interests have changed over time in the past.
# ''Map basic trends and driving forces.'' This includes industry, economic, political, technological, legal, and societal trends. Assess to what degree these trends will affect your research question. Describe each trend, how and why it will affect the organisation. In this step of the process, brainstorming is commonly used, where all trends that can be thought of are presented before they are assessed, to capture possible group thinking and tunnel vision.
# ''Find key uncertainties.'' Map the driving forces on two axes, assessing each force on an uncertain/(relatively) predictable and important/unimportant scale. All driving forces that are considered unimportant are discarded. Important driving forces that are relatively predictable (ex. demographics) can be included in any scenario, so the scenarios should not be based on these. This leaves you with a number of important and unpredictable driving forces. At this point, it is also useful to assess whether any linkages between driving forces exist, and rule out any "impossible" scenarios (ex. full employment and zero inflation).
# ''Check for the possibility to group the linked forces'' and if possible, reduce the forces to the ''two'' most important. (To allow the scenarios to be presented in a neat [[Cartesian coordinate system|xy-diagram]])
# ''Identify the extremes'' of the possible outcomes of the two driving forces and check the dimensions for consistency and plausibility. Three key points should be assessed:
## Time frame: are the trends compatible within the time frame in question?
## Internal consistency: do the forces describe uncertainties that can construct probable scenarios.
## Vs the stakeholders: are any stakeholders currently in disequilibrium compared to their preferred situation, and will this evolve the scenario? Is it possible to create probable scenarios when considering the stakeholders? This is most important when creating macro-scenarios where governments, large organisations et al. will try to influence the outcome.
# ''Define the scenarios,'' plotting them on a grid if possible. Usually, two to four scenarios are constructed. The current situation does not need to be in the middle of the diagram (inflation may already be low), and possible scenarios may keep one (or more) of the forces relatively constant, especially if using three or more driving forces. One approach can be to create all positive elements into one scenario and all negative elements (relative to the current situation) in another scenario, then refining these. In the end, try to avoid pure best-case and worst-case scenarios.
# ''Write out the scenarios.'' Narrate what has happened and what the reasons can be for the proposed situation. Try to include good reasons why the changes have occurred as this helps the further analysis. Finally, give each scenario a descriptive (and catchy) name to ease later reference.
# ''Assess the scenarios.'' Are they relevant for the goal? Are they internally consistent? Are they archetypical? Do they represent relatively stable outcome situations?
# ''Identify research needs.'' Based on the scenarios, assess where more information is needed. Where needed, obtain more information on the motivations of stakeholders, possible innovations that may occur in the industry and so on.
# ''Develop quantitative methods.'' If possible, develop models to help quantify consequences of the various scenarios, such as growth rate, cash flow etc. This step does of course require a significant amount of work compared to the others, and may be left out in back-of-the-envelope-analyses.
# ''Converge towards decision scenarios.'' Retrace the steps above in an iterative process until you reach scenarios which address the fundamental issues facing the organization. Try to assess upsides and downsides of the possible scenarios.

===In military applications===
Scenario planning is also extremely popular with military planners. Most states' department of war maintains a continuously updated series of strategic plans to cope with well-known military or strategic problems. These plans are almost always based on scenarios, and often the plans and scenarios are kept up-to-date by war games, sometimes played out with real troops. This process was first carried out (arguably the method was invented by) the Prussian general staff of the mid-19th century.

==Development of scenario analysis in business organizations==
In the past, strategic plans have often considered only the "official future", which was usually a straight-line graph of current trends carried into the future. Often the trend lines were generated by the accounting department, and lacked discussions of demographics, or qualitative differences in social conditions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

These simplistic guesses are surprisingly good most of the time, but fail to consider qualitative social changes that can affect a business or government. Scenarios focus on the joint effect of many factors. Scenario planning helps us understand how the various strands of a complex tapestry move if one or more threads are pulled&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. When you just list possible causes, as for instance in fault tree analysis, you may tend to discount any one factor in isolation. But when you explore the factors together, you realize that certain combinations could magnify each other’s impact or likelihood. For instance, an increased trade deficit may trigger an economic recession, which in turn creates unemployment and reduces domestic production. [[Paul J. H. Schoemaker]]  offers a strong managerial case for the use of scenario planning in business and had wide impact.&lt;ref name="schoemaker1995"&gt;Schoemaker, Paul J.H. “Scenario Planning:  A Tool for Strategic Thinking,” ''Sloan Management Review''. Winter: 1995, pp. 25-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenarios planning starts by dividing our knowledge into two broad domains: (1) things we believe we know something about and (2) elements we consider uncertain or unknowable. The first component – trends – casts the past forward, recognizing that our world possesses considerable momentum and continuity. For example, we can safely make assumptions about demographic shifts and, perhaps, substitution effects for certain new technologies. The second component – true uncertainties – involve indeterminables such as future interest rates, outcomes of political elections, rates of innovation, fads and fashions in markets, and so on. The art of scenario planning lies in blending the known and the unknown into a limited number of internally consistent views of the future that span a very wide range of possibilities.  In [[project management]], this is called the [[cone of uncertainty]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Numerous organizations have applied scenario planning to a broad range of issues, from relatively simple, tactical decisions to the complex process of strategic planning and vision building.&lt;ref name="schwartz1991"&gt;Schwartz, Peter. ''The Art of the Long View''. Doubleday, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanderheijden1996"&gt;van der Heijden, Kees. ''Scenarios: The Art of Strategic Conversation''. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ringland1998"&gt;Ringland, Gil. ''Scenario Planning: Managing for the Future''. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of scenario planning for business was originally established by Royal Dutch/Shell, which has used scenarios since the early 1970s as part of a process for generating and evaluating its strategic options.&lt;ref name="wack1985"&gt;Wack, Pierre. "Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead", ''Harvard Business Review''. September–October, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schoemakervanderheijden1992"&gt;Schoemaker, Paul J.H. and Cornelius A.J.M. van der Heijden, "Integrating Scenarios into Strategic Planning at Royal Dutch/Shell," ''Planning Review''. Vol. 20 (3): 1992, pp.41-46.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shell has been consistently better in its oil forecasts than other major oil companies, and saw the overcapacity in the tanker business and Europe’s petrochemicals earlier than its competitors.&lt;ref name="schwartz1991" /&gt;  The approach may have had more impact outside Shell than within, as many others firms and consultancies started to benefit as well from scenario planning.  Scenario planning is as much art as science, and prone to a variety of traps (both in process and content) as enumerated by [[Paul J. H. Schoemaker]].&lt;ref name="schoemaker1995" /&gt; More recently scenario planning has been discussed as a tool to improve the strategic agility, by cognitively preparing not only multiple scenarios but also multiple consistent strategies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.  

==History of use by academic and commercial organizations==
Most authors attribute the introduction of scenario planning to [[Herman Kahn]] through his work for the US Military in the 1950s at the RAND Corporation where he developed a [[Futures techniques|technique of describing the future]] in stories as if written by people in the future. He adopted the term "scenarios" to describe these stories. In 1961 he founded the Hudson Institute where he expanded his scenario work to social forecasting and public policy.&lt;ref name="Schwartz1991"&gt;Schwartz, Peter. .

Thinking About the Unthinkable. New York: Horizon Press, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Kahn is often cited as the father of scenario planning, at the same time Kahn was developing his methods at RAND, Gaston Berger was developing similar methods at the Centre d’Etudes Prospectives which he founded in France. His method, which he named 'La Prospective', was to develop normative scenarios of the future which were to be used as a guide in formulating public policy. During the mid-1960s various authors from the French and American institutions began to publish scenario planning concepts such as 'La Prospective' by Berger in 1964&lt;ref name="berger1964"&gt;Berger, G. "Phénoménologies du Temps et Prospectives." Presse Universitaires de France, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'The Next Thirty-Three Years' by Kahn and Wiener in 1967.&lt;ref name="Kahn"&gt;Kahn, Herman, and Anthony J. Wiener. "The Next Thirty-Three Years: A Framework for Speculation." Daedalus 96 3 (1967): 705-32.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s scenario planning was in full swing with a number of institutions now established to provide support to business including the Hudson Foundation, the Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]), and the SEMA Metra Consulting Group in France. Several large companies also began to embrace scenario planning including [[DHL Express]], [[Dutch Royal Shell]] and [[General Electric]].&lt;ref name="Chermack2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bradfield2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Godet1996"&gt;Godet, Michel, and Fabrice Roubelat. "Creating the Future :The Use and Misuse of Scenarios." Long Range Planning 29 2 (1996): 164-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godet2000"&gt;Godet, Michel, Fabrice Roubelat, and Guest Editors. "Scenario Planning: An Open Future." Technological Forecasting and Social Change 65 1 (2000): 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly as a result of these very sophisticated approaches, and of the difficult techniques they employed (which usually demanded the resources of a central planning staff), scenarios earned a reputation for difficulty (and cost) in use. Even so, the theoretical importance of the use of alternative scenarios, to help address the uncertainty implicit in long-range forecasts, was dramatically underlined by the widespread confusion which followed the Oil Shock of 1973. As a result, many of the larger organizations started to use the technique in one form or another. By 1983 Diffenbach reported that 'alternate scenarios' were the third most popular technique for long-range forecasting – used by 68% of the large organizations he surveyed.&lt;ref name="diffenbach1983"&gt;Diffenbach, John. "Corporate Environmental Analysis in Large US Corporations," ''Long Range Planning''. 16 (3), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Practical development of scenario forecasting, to guide strategy rather than for the more limited academic uses which had previously been the case, was started by [[Pierre Wack]] in 1971 at the Royal Dutch Shell group of companies – and it, too, was given impetus by the Oil Shock two years later. Shell has, since that time, led the commercial world in the use of scenarios – and in the development of more practical techniques to support these. Indeed, as – in common with most forms of long-range forecasting – the use of scenarios has (during the depressed trading conditions of the last decade) reduced to only a handful of private-sector organisations, Shell remains almost alone amongst them in keeping the technique at the forefront of forecasting.&lt;ref name="Wack1985"&gt;Wack, Peter. "Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead," Harvard Business Review. September–October, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has only been anecdotal evidence offered in support of the value of scenarios, even as aids to forecasting; and most of this has come from one company – Shell. In addition, with so few organisations making consistent use of them – and with the timescales involved reaching into decades – it is unlikely that any definitive supporting evidenced will be forthcoming in the foreseeable future. For the same reasons, though, a lack of such proof applies to almost all long-range planning techniques. In the absence of proof, but taking account of Shell's well documented experiences of using it over several decades (where, in the 1990s, its then CEO ascribed its success to its use of such scenarios), can be significant benefit to be obtained from extending the horizons of  managers' long-range forecasting in the way that the use of scenarios uniquely does.&lt;ref name="mercer1995"&gt;Mercer, David. "Simpler Scenarios," ''Management Decision''. Vol. 33 Issue 4:1995, pp 32-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of Shell's use of scenario planning===
In the 1970s, many energy companies were surprised by both [[environmentalism]] and the [[OPEC]] cartel, and thereby lost billions of dollars of revenue by mis-investment. The dramatic financial effects of these changes led at least one organization, Royal Dutch Shell, to implement scenario planning. The analysts of this company publicly estimated that this planning process made their company the largest in the world.&lt;ref name="schwartz1991" /&gt; However other observers{{Who|date=April 2017}} of Shell's use of scenario planning have suggested that few if any significant long term business advantages accrued to Shell from the use of scenario methodology{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Whilst the intellectual robustness of Shell's long term scenarios was seldom in doubt their actual practical use was seen as being minimal by many senior Shell executives{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. A Shell insider has commented "The scenario team were bright and their work was of a very high intellectual level. However neither the high level "Group scenarios" nor the country level scenarios produced with operating companies really made much difference when key decisions were being taken".{{source needed|reason=The quote needs a source.  Or are the quotation marks in the wrong place.|date=October 2016}}

The use of scenarios was audited by [[Arie de Geus]]'s team in the early 1980s and they found that the decision-making processes following the scenarios were the primary cause of the lack of strategic implementation {{clarify|date=November 2015}} ), rather than the scenarios themselves. Many practitioners today spend as much time on the decision-making process as on creating the scenarios themselves.

&lt;!-- how is this a critique? --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Cornelius et al. 2005"&gt;Cornelius, Peter, Van de Putte, Alexander, and Romani, Mattia. "Three Decades of Scenario Planning in Shell," ''California Management Review''. Vol. 48 Issue 1:Fall 2005, pp 92-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General limitations==
Although scenario planning has gained much adherence in industry, its subjective and heuristic nature leaves many academics uncomfortable. How do we know if we have the right scenarios?  And how do we go from scenarios to decisions?  These concerns are legitimate and scenario planning would gain in academic standing if more research were conducted on its comparative performance and underlying theoretical premises. A collection of chapters by noted scenario planners&lt;ref name="faheyrandall1998"&gt;Fahey, Liam and Randall, Robert M. ''Learning from the Future''. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; failed to contain a single reference to an academic source, though this may be because academics have not caught up or do not have the resources to either do or teach scenario planning.  In general, there are few academically validated analyses of scenario planning (for a notable exception, see [[Paul J. H. Schoemaker]]&lt;ref name="schoemaker1993"&gt;Schoemaker, Paul J.H. “Multiple Scenario Development: Its Conceptual and Behavioral Foundation,” ''Strategic Management Journal''. Vol. 14: 1993, pp 193-213.&lt;/ref&gt;). The technique was born from practice and its appeal is based more on experience than scientific evidence. Furthermore, significant misconceptions remain about its intent and claims.  Above all, scenario planning is a tool for collective learning, reframing perceptions and preserving uncertainty when the latter is pervasive.  Too many decision makers want to bet on one future scenario, falling prey to the seductive temptation of trying to predict the future rather than to entertain multiple futures. Another trap is to take the scenarios too literally as though they were static beacons that map out a fixed future. In actuality, their aim is to bound the future but in a flexible way that permits learning and adjustment as the future unfolds.

One criticism of the two-by-two technique commonly used is that the resulting [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] results in four somewhat arbitrary scenario themes. If other key uncertainties had been selected, it might be argued, very different scenarios could emerge.  How true this is depends on whether the matrix is viewed as just a starting point to be superseded by the ensuing blueprint or is considered as the grand architecture that nests everything else. In either case, however, the issue should not be which are the “right” scenarios but rather whether they delineate the range of possible future appropriately. Any tool that tries to simplify a complex picture will introduce distortions, whether it is a geographic map or a set of scenarios. Seldom will complexity decompose naturally into simple states. But it might.  Consider, for example, the behavior of water (the molecule H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) which, depending on temperature and pressure, naturally exists in just one of three states: gas, liquid or ice. The art of scenarios is to look for such natural states or points of bifurcation in the behavior of a complex system.

Apart from some inherent subjectivity in scenario design, the technique can suffer from various process and content traps.&lt;ref name="schoemaker1998"&gt;Schoemaker, Paul J.H. "Twenty Common Pitfalls in Scenario Planning", in ''Learning from the Future''. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998, pp 422-431.&lt;/ref&gt; These traps mostly relate to how the process is conducted in organizations (such as team composition, role of facilitators, etc.) as well as the substantive focus of the scenarios (long vs. short term, global vs. regional, incremental vs. paradigm shifting, etc.). One might think of these as merely challenges of implementation, but since the process component is integral to the scenario experience, they can also be viewed as weaknesses of the methodology itself. Limited safeguards exist against political derailing, agenda control, myopia and limited imagination when conducting scenario planning exercises within real organizations. But, to varying extents, all forecasting techniques will suffer from such organizational limitations. The benchmark to use is not perfection, especially when faced with high uncertainty and complexity, or even strict adherence to such normative precepts as procedural invariance and logical consistency, but whether the technique performs better than its rivals. And to answer this question fairly, performance must be carefully specified. It should clearly include some measures of accuracy as well as a cost-benefit analysis that considers the tradeoff between effort and accuracy. In addition, legitimation criteria may be important to consider as well as the ability to refine and improve the approach as more experience is gained.

A third limitation of scenario planning in organizational settings is its weak integration into other planning and forecasting techniques.  Most companies have plenty of trouble dealing with just one future, let alone multiple ones. Typically, budgeting and planning systems are predicated on single views of the future, with adjustments made as necessary through variance analysis, contingency planning, rolling budgets, and periodic renegotiations. The weaknesses of these traditional approaches were very evident after the tragic attack of [[September 11, 2001]] when many companies became paralyzed and quite a few just threw away the plan and budget. Their strategies were not future-proof and they lacked organized mechanisms to adjust to external turmoil. In cases of crisis, leadership becomes important but so does some degree of preparedness.  Once the scenarios are finished, the real works starts of how to craft flexible strategies and appropriate monitoring systems.&lt;ref name="schoemaker2002" /&gt; Managers need a simple but comprehensive compass to navigate uncertainty from beginning to end. Scenario planning is just one component of a more complete management system. The point is that scenario thinking needs to be integrated with the existing planning and budgeting system, as awkward as this fit may be. The reality is that most organizations do not handle uncertainty well and that researchers have not provided adequate answers about how to plan under conditions of high uncertainty and complexity.

==Use by managers==
The basic concepts of the process are relatively simple. In terms of the overall approach to forecasting, they can be divided into three main groups of activities (which are, generally speaking, common to all long range forecasting processes):&lt;ref name="mercer1995" /&gt;
 
#Environmental analysis
#Scenario planning
#Corporate strategy
  
The first of these groups quite simply comprises the normal [[environmental analysis]]. This is almost exactly the same as that which should be undertaken as the first stage of any serious long-range planning. However, the quality of this analysis is especially important in the context of scenario planning. 
 
The central part represents the specific techniques – covered here – which differentiate the scenario forecasting process from the others in long-range planning.
 
The final group represents all the subsequent processes which go towards producing the [[corporate strategy]] and plans. Again, the requirements are slightly different but in general they follow all the rules of sound long-range planning.

==Process==
The part of the overall process which is radically different from most other forms of long-range planning is the central section, the actual production of the scenarios. Even this, though, is relatively simple, at its most basic level. As derived from the approach most commonly used by Shell,&lt;ref name="Scenarios: An Explorer's Guide"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shell|title=Scenarios: An Explorer's Guide|url=http://s05.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/public/downloads/brochures/corporate-pkg/scenarios/explorers-guide.pdf|website=www.shell.com/scenarios|publisher=Shell Global|accessdate=15 July 2014|ref=http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios/explorers-guide.html|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it follows six steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meinert|first1=Sacha|title=Field manual - Scenario building|date=2014|publisher=Etui|location=Brussels|isbn=978-2-87452-314-4|url=http://www.etui.org/content/download/13953/114820/file/2014_Scenario_Building_DEF.pdf|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
#Decide drivers for change/assumptions
#Bring drivers together into a viable framework
#Produce 7–9 initial mini-scenarios
#Reduce to 2–3 scenarios
#Draft the scenarios
#Identify the issues arising

===Step 1 – decide assumptions/drivers for change===
The first stage is to examine the results of environmental analysis to determine which are the most important factors that will decide the nature of the future environment within which the organisation operates. These factors are sometimes called 'variables' (because they will vary over the time being investigated, though the terminology may confuse scientists who use it in a more rigorous manner). Users tend to prefer the term 'drivers' (for change), since this terminology is not laden with quasi-scientific connotations and reinforces the participant's commitment to search for those forces which will act to change the future. Whatever the nomenclature, the main requirement is that these will be informed assumptions.
 
This is partly a process of analysis, needed to recognise what these 'forces' might be. However, it is likely that some work on this element will already have taken place during the preceding environmental analysis. By the time the formal scenario planning stage has been reached, the participants may have already decided – probably in their sub-conscious rather than formally – what the main forces are.
 
In the ideal approach, the first stage should be to carefully decide the overall assumptions on which the scenarios will be based. Only then, as a second stage, should the various drivers be specifically defined. Participants, though, seem to have problems in separating these stages.
 
Perhaps the most difficult aspect though, is freeing the participants from the preconceptions they take into the process with them. In particular, most participants will want to look at the medium term, five to ten years ahead rather than the required longer-term, ten or more years ahead. However, a time horizon of anything less than ten years often leads participants to extrapolate from present trends, rather than consider the alternatives which might face them. When, however, they are asked to consider timescales in excess of ten years they almost all seem to accept the logic of the scenario planning process, and no longer fall back on that of extrapolation.  There is a similar problem with expanding participants horizons to include the whole external environment.

'''Brainstorming'''
 
In any case, the brainstorming which should then take place, to ensure that the list is complete, may unearth more variables – and, in particular, the combination of factors may suggest yet others. 
 
A very simple technique which is especially useful at this – [[brainstorming]] – stage, and in general for handling scenario planning debates is derived from use in Shell where this type of approach is often used. An especially easy approach, it only requires a conference room with a bare wall and copious supplies of 3M [[Post-It Notes]].
 
The six to ten people ideally taking part in such face-to-face debates should be in a conference room environment which is isolated from outside interruptions. The only special requirement is that the conference room has at least one clear wall on which Post-It notes will stick. At the start of the meeting itself, any topics which have already been identified during the environmental analysis stage are written (preferably with a  thick magic marker, so they can be read from a distance) on separate Post-It Notes. These Post-It Notes are then, at least in theory, randomly placed on the wall. In practice, even at this early stage the participants will want to cluster them in groups which seem to make sense. The only requirement (which is why Post-It Notes are ideal for this approach) is that there is no bar to taking them off again and moving them to a new cluster.

A similar technique – using 5" by 3" index cards – has also been described (as the 'Snowball Technique'), by Backoff and Nutt, for grouping and evaluating ideas in general.&lt;ref&gt;Backoff, R.W. and P.C. Nutt. "A Process for Strategic Management with Specific Application for the Non-Profit Organization," ''Strategic Planning: Threats and Opportunities for Planners''. Planners Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As in any form of brainstorming, the initial ideas almost invariably stimulate others. Indeed, everyone should be encouraged to add their own Post-It Notes to those on the wall. However it differs from the 'rigorous' form described in 'creative thinking' texts, in that it is much slower paced and the ideas are discussed immediately. In practice, as many ideas may be removed, as not being relevant, as are added. Even so, it follows many of the same rules as normal brainstorming and typically lasts the same length of time – say, an hour or so only.
 
It is important that all the participants feel they 'own' the wall – and are encouraged to move the notes around themselves. The result is a very powerful form of creative decision-making for groups, which is applicable to a wide range of situations (but is especially powerful in the context of scenario planning). It also offers a very good introduction for those who are coming to the scenario process for the first time. Since the workings are largely self-evident, participants very quickly come to understand exactly what is involved. 
 
'''Important and uncertain'''
 
This step is, though, also one of selection – since only the most important factors will justify a place in the scenarios. The [[Pareto principle|80:20 Rule]] here means that, at the end of the process, management's attention must be focused on a limited number of most important issues. Experience has proved that offering a wider range of topics merely allows them to select those few which interest them, and not necessarily those which are most important to the organisation.
 
In addition, as scenarios are a technique for presenting alternative futures, the factors to be included must be genuinely 'variable'. They should be subject to significant alternative outcomes. Factors whose outcome is predictable, but important, should be spelled out in the introduction to the scenarios (since they cannot be ignored). The Important Uncertainties Matrix, as reported by Kees van der Heijden of Shell, is a useful check at this stage.&lt;ref name="vanderheijden1996" /&gt;
 
At this point it is also worth pointing out that a great virtue of scenarios is that they can accommodate the input from any other form of forecasting. They may use figures, diagrams or words in any combination. No other form of forecasting offers this flexibility.

===Step 2 – bring drivers together into a viable framework===
The next step is to link these drivers together to provide a meaningful framework. This may be obvious, where some of the factors are clearly related to each other in one way or another. For instance, a technological factor may lead to market changes, but may be constrained by legislative factors. On the other hand, some of the 'links' (or at least the 'groupings') may need to be artificial at this stage. At a later stage more meaningful links may be found, or the factors may then be rejected from the scenarios. In the most theoretical approaches to the subject, probabilities are attached to the event strings. This is difficult to achieve, however, and generally adds little – except complexity – to the outcomes.
 
This is probably the most (conceptually) difficult step. It is where managers' 'intuition' – their ability to make sense of complex patterns of  'soft' data which more rigorous analysis would be unable to handle – plays an important role. There are, however, a range of techniques which can help; and again the Post-It-Notes approach is especially useful:
 
Thus, the participants try to arrange the  drivers, which have emerged from the first stage, into groups which seem to make sense to them. Initially there may be many small groups. The intention should, therefore, be to gradually merge these (often having to reform them from new combinations of drivers to make these bigger groups work). The aim of this stage is eventually to make 6–8 larger groupings;  'mini-scenarios'. Here the Post-It Notes may be moved dozens of times over the length – perhaps several hours or more – of each meeting. While this process is taking place the participants will probably want to add new topics – so more Post-It Notes are added to the wall. In the opposite direction, the unimportant ones are removed (possibly to be grouped, again as an 'audit trail' on another wall). More important, the 'certain' topics are also removed from the main area of debate – in this case they must be grouped in clearly labelled area of the main wall.
 
As the clusters – the 'mini-scenarios' – emerge, the associated notes may be stuck to each other rather than individually to the wall; which makes it easier to move the clusters around (and is a considerable help during the final, demanding stage to reducing the scenarios to two or three).
 
The great benefit of using Post-It Notes is that there is no bar to participants changing their minds. If they want to rearrange the groups – or simply to go back (iterate) to an earlier stage – then they strip them off and put them in their new position.

===Step 3 – produce initial mini-scenarios===
The outcome of the previous step is usually between seven and nine logical groupings of drivers. This is usually easy to achieve. The 'natural' reason for this may be that it represents some form of limit as to what participants can visualise. 
 
Having placed the factors in these groups, the next action is to work out, very approximately at this stage, what is the connection between them. What does each group of factors represent?

===Step 4 – reduce to two or three scenarios===
The main action, at this next stage, is to reduce the seven to nine mini-scenarios/groupings detected at the previous stage to two or three larger scenarios. The challenge in practice seems to come down to finding just two or three 'containers' into which all the topics can be sensibly fitted. This usually requires a considerable amount of debate – but in the process it typically generates as much light as it does heat. Indeed, the demanding process of developing these basic scenario frameworks often, by itself, produces fundamental insights into what are the really important (perhaps life and death) issues affecting the organisation. During this extended debate – and even before it is summarised in the final reports – the participants come to understand, by their own involvement in the debate, what the most important drivers for change may be, and (perhaps even more important) what their peers think they are. Based on this intimate understanding, they are well prepared to cope with such changes – reacting almost instinctively – when they actually do happen; even without recourse to the formal reports which are eventually produced!
 
There is no theoretical reason for reducing to just two or three scenarios, only a practical one. It has been found that the managers who will be asked to use the final scenarios can only cope effectively with a maximum of three versions! Shell started, more than three decades ago, by building half a dozen or more scenarios – but found that the outcome was that their managers selected just one of these to concentrate on. As a result, the planners reduced the number to three, which managers could handle easily but could no longer so easily justify the selection of only one! This is the number now recommended most frequently in most of the literature.   
 
'''Complementary scenarios'''
 
As used by Shell, and as favoured by a number of the academics, two scenarios should be complementary; the reason being that this helps avoid managers 'choosing' just one, 'preferred', scenario – and lapsing once more into single-track forecasting (negating the benefits of using 'alternative' scenarios to allow for alternative, uncertain futures). This is, however, a potentially difficult concept to grasp, where managers are used to looking for opposites; a good and a bad scenario, say, or an optimistic one versus a pessimistic one – and indeed this is the approach (for small businesses) advocated by Foster. In the Shell approach, the two scenarios are required to be equally likely, and between them to cover all the 'event strings'/drivers. Ideally they should not be obvious opposites, which might once again bias their acceptance by users, so the choice of  'neutral' titles is important. For example, Shell's two scenarios at the beginning of the 1990s were titled 'Sustainable World' and 'Global Mercantilism'[xv]. In practice, we found that this requirement, much to our surprise, posed few problems for the great majority, 85%, of those in the survey; who easily produced 'balanced' scenarios. The remaining 15% mainly fell into the expected trap of 'good versus bad'. We have found that our own relatively complex (OBS) scenarios can also be made complementary to each other; without any great effort needed from the teams involved; and the resulting two scenarios are both developed further by all involved, without unnecessary focusing on one or the other.
 
'''Testing'''
 
Having grouped the factors into these two scenarios, the next step is to test them, again, for viability. Do they make sense to the participants? This may be in terms of logical analysis, but it may also be in terms of intuitive 'gut-feel'. Once more, intuition often may offer a useful – if academically less respectable – vehicle for reacting to the complex and ill-defined issues typically involved. If the scenarios do not intuitively 'hang together', why not? The usual problem is that one or more of the assumptions turns out to be unrealistic in terms of how the participants see their world. If this is the case then you need to return to the first step – the whole scenario planning process is above all an iterative one (returning to its beginnings a number of times until the final outcome makes the best sense).

===Step 5 – write the scenarios===
The scenarios are then 'written up' in the most suitable form. The flexibility of this step often confuses participants, for they are used to forecasting processes which have a fixed format. The rule, though, is that you should produce the scenarios in the form most suitable for use by the managers who are going to base their strategy on them. Less obviously, the managers who are going to implement this strategy should also be taken into account. They will also be exposed to the scenarios, and will need to believe in these. This is essentially a 'marketing' decision, since it will be very necessary to 'sell' the final results to the users. On the other hand, a not inconsiderable consideration may be to use the form the author also finds most comfortable. If the form is alien to him or her the chances are that the resulting scenarios will carry little conviction when it comes to the 'sale'. 
 
Most scenarios will, perhaps, be written in word form (almost as a series of alternative essays about the future); especially where they will almost inevitably be qualitative  which is hardly surprising where managers, and their audience, will probably use this in their day to day communications. Some, though use an expanded series of lists and some enliven their reports by adding some fictional 'character' to the material – perhaps taking literally the idea that they are stories about the future – though they are still clearly intended to be factual. On the other hand, they may include numeric data and/or diagrams – as those of Shell do (and in the process gain by the acid test of more measurable 'predictions').

===Step 6 – identify issues arising===
The final stage of the process is to examine these scenarios to determine what are the most critical outcomes; the 'branching points' relating to the 'issues' which will have the greatest impact (potentially generating 'crises') on the future of the organisation. The subsequent strategy will have to address these – since the normal approach to strategy deriving from scenarios is one which aims to minimise risk by being 'robust' (that is it will safely cope with all the alternative outcomes of these 'life and death' issues) rather than aiming for performance (profit) maximisation by gambling on one outcome.

==Use of scenarios==
It is important to note that scenarios may be used in a number of ways:
 
'''a) Containers for the drivers/event strings'''
 
Most basically, they are a logical device, an artificial framework, for presenting the individual factors/topics (or coherent groups of these) so that these are made easily available for managers' use – as useful ideas about future developments in their  own right – without reference to the rest of the scenario. It should be stressed that no factors should be dropped, or even given lower priority, as a result of producing the scenarios. In this context, which scenario contains which topic (driver), or issue about the future, is irrelevant. 
 
'''b) Tests for consistency'''
 
At every stage it is necessary to iterate, to check that the contents are viable and make any necessary changes to ensure that they are; here the main test is to see if the scenarios seem to be internally consistent – if they are not then the writer must loop back to earlier stages to correct the problem. Though it has been mentioned previously, it is important to stress once again that scenario building is ideally an iterative process. It usually does not just happen in one meeting – though even one attempt is better than none – but takes place over a number of meetings as the participants gradually refine their ideas.
 
'''c) Positive perspectives'''
 
Perhaps the main benefit deriving from scenarios, however, comes from the alternative 'flavors' of the future their different perspectives offer. It is a common experience, when the scenarios finally emerge, for the participants to be startled by the insight they offer – as to what the general shape of the future might be – at this stage it no longer is a theoretical exercise but becomes a genuine framework (or rather set of alternative frameworks) for dealing with that.

==Scenario planning compared to other techniques==
Scenario planning differs from [[contingency planning]], [[sensitivity analysis]] and [[computer simulation]]s.&lt;ref name="schoemaker2002"&gt;Schoemaker, Paul J.H. ''Profiting from Uncertainty''. Free Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contingency planning is a "What if" tool, that only takes into account one uncertainty. However, scenario planning considers combinations of uncertainties in each scenario. Planners also try to select especially plausible but uncomfortable combinations of social developments.

Sensitivity analysis analyzes changes in one variable only, which is useful for simple changes, while scenario planning tries to expose policy makers to significant interactions of major variables.

While scenario planning can benefit from computer simulations, scenario planning is less formalized, and can be used to make plans for qualitative patterns that show up in a wide variety of simulated events.

During the past 5 years, computer supported [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|Morphological Analysis]] has been employed as aid in scenario development by the [[Swedish Defence Research Agency]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="erikssonritchey"&gt;T. Eriksson &amp; T. Ritchey, {{cite web |url=http://www.swemorph.com/pdf/cornwallis3.pdf |title=Scenario Development using Computer Aided Morphological Analysis}} Adapted from a Paper Presented at the Winchester International OR Conference, England, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This method makes it possible to create a multi-variable morphological field which can be treated as an inference model – thus integrating scenario planning techniques with [[contingency analysis]] and [[sensitivity analysis]].

==Combination of Delphi and scenarios==
Scenario planning concerns planning based on the systematic examination of the future by picturing plausible and consistent images thereof. [[Delphi method|Delphi]], in turn, attempts to develop systematically expert opinion consensus concerning future developments and events. It is a judgmental forecasting procedure in form of an anonymous, written, multi-stage survey process, where feedback of group opinion is provided after each round.

Numerous researchers have stressed that both approaches are best suited to be combined. Kinkel et al. (2006)&lt;ref name="Kinkel06"&gt;Kinkel, S., Armbruster, H., &amp; Schirrmeister, E. (2006). Szenario-Delphi oder Delphi-Szenario? Erfahrungen aus zwei Vorausschaustudien mit der Kombination dieser Methoden. In J. Gausemeier (Ed.), Vorausschau und Technologieplanung: 2. Symposium für Vorausschau und Technologieplanung (pp. 109-137). Paderborn: Heinz-Nixdorf-Institut.&lt;/ref&gt; recently reported on their experiences with both Delphi-scenarios and scenario-Delphis. The authors found that, due to their process similarity, the two methodologies can be easily combined. Generally speaking, the output of the different phases of the Delphi method can be used as input for the scenario method and vice versa. A combination makes a realization of the benefits of both tools possible. In practice, usually one of the two tools is considered the dominant methodology and the other one is integrated at some stage. In fact, the authors found that in either case the combination of the methodologies adds significant value to futures projects.

The variant that is most often found in practice is the integration of the Delphi method into the scenario process (see e.g. Rikkonen, 2005;&lt;ref name="Rik05"&gt;Rikkonen, P. (2005). Utilisation of alternative scenario approaches in defining the policy agenda for future agriculture in Finland. Turku School of Economics and Business Administration, Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; von der Gracht, 2007;&lt;ref name="vdGracht07"&gt;von der Gracht, H. (2007). Scenario Planning for Logistics Service Providers. Planning Practices and Scenarios for 2025. EBS Business School, Supply Chain Management Institute, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.pwc.com/en_GX/gx/transportation-logistics/tl2030/tl2030-pub.jhtml Transportation &amp; Logistics 2030 – How will supply chains evolve in an energy constrained and low-carbon world]; [http://www.pwc.com/en_GX/gx/transportation-logistics/tl2030/infrastructure/supply-chains.jhtml Transportation &amp; Logistics 2030 – Transport infrastructure – Engine or hand brakes for global supply chains?]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110719193840/http://www.ebs.edu/smi/1661.html?&amp;L=1 Future of Logistics – Global Scenarios 2025]).  Authors refer to this type as Delphi-scenario (writing), expert-based scenarios, or Delphi panel derived scenarios. Von der Gracht (2010)&lt;ref name = "vdG2010"&gt;von der Gracht, H. A./ Darkow, I.-L.: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527310001349 Scenarios for the Logistics Service Industry: A Delphi-based analysis for 2025]. In: International Journal of Production Economics, Vol. 127, No. 1, 2010, 46-59.&lt;/ref&gt; is a scientifically valid example of this method. Since scenario planning is “information hungry”, Delphi research can deliver valuable input for the process. There are various types of information output of Delphi that can be used as input for scenario planning. Researchers can, for example, identify relevant events or developments and, based on expert opinion, assign probabilities to them. Moreover, expert comments and arguments provide deeper insights into relationships of factors that can, in turn, be integrated into scenarios afterwards. Also, Delphi helps to identify extreme opinions and dissent among the experts. Such controversial topics are particularly suited for extreme scenarios or wildcards.

In his doctoral thesis, Rikkonen (2005)&lt;ref name="Rik05"/&gt; examined the utilization of Delphi techniques in scenario planning and, concretely, in construction of scenarios. The author comes to the conclusion that the Delphi technique has instrumental value in providing different alternative futures and the argumentation of scenarios. It is therefore recommended to use Delphi in order to make the scenarios more profound and to create confidence in scenario planning. Further benefits lie in the simplification of the scenario writing process and the deep understanding of the interrelations between the forecast items and social factors.

The '''Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation''' is a nonprofit organization founded in 1937 by philanthropist [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]] and his long-time art advisor, artist [[Hilla von Rebay]].  The foundation is a leading institution for the collection, preservation, and research of [[modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]] and operates several museums around the world.  The first museum established by the foundation was The Museum of Non-Objective Painting, in New York City.  This became [[The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in 1952, and the foundation moved the collection into its first permanent museum building, in New York City, in 1959. The foundation next opened the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]] in Venice, Italy, in 1980. Its international network of museums expanded in 1997 to include the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] in [[Bilbao]], Spain, and it expects to open a new museum, [[Guggenheim Abu Dhabi]], in the United Arab Emirates in 2017.

The mission of the foundation is "to promote the understanding and appreciation of art, architecture, and other manifestations of visual culture, primarily of the modern and contemporary periods, and to collect, conserve, and study" modern and contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/guggenheim-foundation/mission-statement "Mission Statement"], Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Retrieved March 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation seeks, in its constituent museums, to unite distinguished architecture and artworks.  The foundation's first permanent museum, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, is housed in a modern spiral building designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and the Guggenheim Bilbao was designed by [[Frank Gehry]].  Both of these innovative designs received wide press and critical attention.  The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is housed in an 18th-century Italian palace, the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]].

The permanent collection of the foundation is based primarily on nine private collections: Solomon R. Guggenheim's collection of [[non-objective art|non-objective]] paintings; Karl Nierendorf's collection of [[German expressionism]] and early [[abstract expressionism]]; [[Katherine S. Dreier]]'s gift of paintings and sculptures; Peggy Guggenheim's collection, concentrating on [[Abstraction (art)|abstraction]] and [[surrealism]]; Justin K. and Hilde Thannhauser's collection of [[impressionist]], [[post-impressionist]], and early modern masterpieces; part of Hilla von Rebay's collection; [[Giuseppe Panza|Giuseppe Panza di Biumo's]] holdings of American [[minimalist art|minimalist]], [[Postminimalism|post-minimalist]], [[Environmental art|environmental]] and [[conceptual art]] of the 1960s and 1970s; a collection of photographs and mixed media from the [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] Foundation; and the Bohen Foundation's collection of film, video, photography and new media.&lt;ref name=cork&gt;[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/museums/guggenheim-new-york.htm "Guggenheim Museum New York"], ''Encyclopedia of Art'', visual-arts-cork.com. Retrieved April 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation's collections have expanded greatly through eight decades and include every major movement of 20th- and 21st-century art.  Its directors and curators have attempted to form a single collection that is not encyclopedic, but rather based on their unique visions.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection has grown in scope to include new media and performance art, and the foundation has entered into collaborations with YouTube and [[BMW]].

==History==

===Hilla Rebay and early years===
[[Solomon R. Guggenheim]], a member of a wealthy mining family, began collecting works of the [[old masters]] in the 1890s.  He retired from his business in 1919 to devote more time to art collecting.  In 1926, at age 66, he met artist [[Hilla von Rebay]], who was commissioned by Guggenheim's wife, Irene Rothschild, to paint his portrait.&lt;ref name=artdaily&gt;[http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=31711&amp;int_modo=2 "Exhibition of Works Reflecting the Evolution of the Guggenheim's Collection Opens in Bilbao"], artdaily.org, 2009. Retrieved April 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Rebay introduced him to European [[avant-garde]] art, in particular abstract art that she felt had a spiritual and utopian aspect ([[non-objective art]]).&lt;ref name=artdaily/&gt; Guggenheim completely changed his collecting strategy.&lt;ref name=past&gt;[http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/hilla_rebay/biographies_2.html "Biography: Solomon R. Guggenheim"], Art of Tomorrow: Hilla Rebay and Solomon R. Guggenheim, Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Retrieved March 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1930, the two visited [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s studio in [[Dessau]], Germany, and Guggenheim began to purchase Kandinsky's work.  The same year, Guggenheim began to display the collection to the public at his apartment in the [[Plaza Hotel]] in New York City.  Guggenheim's purchases continued with the works of [[Rudolf Bauer (artist)|Rudolf Bauer]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], and great artists who were not of the non-objective school, such as [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[László Moholy-Nagy]].&lt;ref name=artdaily/&gt;&lt;ref name=past/&gt;

In 1937, Guggenheim established the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation to foster the appreciation of [[modern art]].&lt;ref name=past/&gt;  The foundation's first venue for the display of art was called the "Museum of Non-Objective Painting".  It opened in 1939 under the direction of Rebay, its first curator, in a former automobile showroom at East 54th Street in [[midtown Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Vail, pp. 25 and 36&lt;/ref&gt;  This moved, in 1947, to another rented space at 1071 [[Fifth Avenue]].&lt;ref name=past/&gt;  Under Rebay's guidance, Guggenheim sought to include in the collection the most important examples of non-objective art available at the time, such as  Kandinsky's ''Composition 8'' (1923), Léger's ''Contrast of Forms'' (1913) and Delaunay's ''Simultaneous Windows'' (2nd Motif, 1st Part)'' (1912).&lt;ref name=Calnek&gt;Calnek, Anthony, et al. ''The Guggenheim Collection'', pp. 39–40, New York: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1940s, the foundation had accumulated such a large collection of avant-garde paintings that the need for a permanent building to house the art collection had become apparent.&lt;ref name=Winter&gt;Winter, Damon. [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/guggenheim_solomon_r_museum/index.html "Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum"], ''The New York Times'', October 21, 2009. Retrieved March 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1943, Guggenheim and Rebay commissioned architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] to design the museum building.&lt;ref&gt;Vail, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;  Rebay conceived of the space as a "temple of the spirit" that would facilitate a new way of looking at the modern pieces in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guggenheim: Frank Lloyd Wright and the Making of the Modern Museum'', pp.  217–18, New York: Guggenheim Museum Publications, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1948, the collection was greatly expanded through the purchase of art dealer Karl Nierendorf's estate of some 730 objects, notably [[German expressionist]] paintings.&lt;ref name=Calnek/&gt;  By that time, the foundation's collection included a broad spectrum of [[expressionist]] and [[surrealist]] works, including paintings by [[Paul Klee]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]] and [[Joan Miró]].&lt;ref name=cork/&gt;&lt;ref name=Calnek/&gt;  Guggenheim died in 1949, and the museum was renamed the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in 1952.  The foundation expanded its display activities with a series of traveling exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Rebaybio&gt;[http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/hilla_rebay/biographies_1.html "Biography: Hilla Rebay"], Art of Tomorrow: Hilla Rebay and Solomon R. Guggenheim, Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Retrieved March 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

After Guggenheim's death, members of the Guggenheim family who sat on the foundation's board of directors had personal and philosophical differences with Rebay, and in 1952 she resigned as director of the museum.&lt;ref name=Rebaybio/&gt;  Nevertheless, she left a portion of her personal collection to the foundation in her will, including works by Kandinsky, Klee, [[Alexander Calder]], Gleizes, [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]].&lt;ref name=cork/&gt;

===Sweeney and completion of the first building===
[[Image:FrankLloydWright1966USstamp.jpg|thumb|right|1966 U.S. postage stamp honoring Frank Lloyd Wright, showing the Guggenheim in the background]]
In 1953, the foundation's collecting boundaries extended even further under its new director, [[James Johnson Sweeney]].  Sweeney rejected Rebay's dismissal of "objective" painting and sculpture, and he soon acquired [[Constantin Brâncuși]]'s ''Adam and Eve'' (1921), followed by works of other modernist sculptors, including [[Jean Arp]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]].&lt;ref name=Calnek/&gt;  Sweeney reached beyond the 20th century to acquire [[Paul Cézanne]]'s ''Man with Crossed Arms'' (c. 1899).&lt;ref name=Calnek/&gt;  In 1953, the foundation received a gift of 28 important works from the Estate of [[Katherine S. Dreier]], a founder of America's first collection to be called a modern art museum, the [[Société Anonyme]].  Dreier had been a colleague of Rebay's. The works included ''Little French Girl'' (1914–18) by Brâncuși, an untitled still life (1916) by [[Juan Gris]], a bronze sculpture (1919) by [[Alexander Archipenko]] and three collages (1919–21) by German Hanoverian [[Dadaist]] Schwitters.  It also included works by Calder, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[El Lissitzky]] and Mondrian.&lt;ref name=cork/&gt;   Among others, Sweeney also acquired the works of [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[David Hayes (sculptor)|David Hayes]], [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Jackson Pollock]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061001061622/http://www.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/past_exhibitions/global_gugg/global_gugg_bottom_index.html ''The Global Guggenheim''], The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum Publications. Retrieved March 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  He also established the Guggenheim International Awards in 1956. Sweeney oversaw the last half dozen years of the construction of the museum building, during which time he had an antagonistic relationship with Frank Lloyd Wright, especially regarding the building's lighting issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061001053110/http://www.guggenheim.org/finding_aids/display.php?%2Fsweeney%2F1  "James Johnson Sweeney Administrative papers"], Solomon R.

The distinctive cylindrical building, wider at the top than the bottom, with a spiral ramp climbing gently from ground level to the skylight at the top, turned out to be Wright's last major work, as the architect died six months before its opening.&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892851,00.html "Last Monument"], ''Time'' magazine, November 2, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;  The building opened in October 1959 to large crowds&lt;ref&gt;Spector, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; and instantly polarized architecture critics,&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewsandCourier&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k4BJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sQsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1721,3684938&amp;dq=guggenheim-museum+new+york&amp;hl=en "Controversial Museum Opens in New York"], ''The News and Courier'', October 22, 1959, p. 9-A.

November 6, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the criticism focused on the idea that the building overshadows the artworks displayed inside,&lt;ref name=Winter/&gt; and that it is difficult to properly hang paintings in the shallow, windowless, concave exhibition niches that surround the central spiral.  Prior to its opening, twenty-one artists signed a letter protesting the display of their work in such a space.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Upon opening, the museum received a largely favorable response from the public, despite the early misgivings: "overall Wright's design was, and still is, admired for being highly personal and inviting".&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Justin.

===Messer and the ramp===
[[File:New York by Piotrus 005.JPG|left|thumb|The Guggenheim's gallery – part of the spiral ramp]] 
[[Thomas M. Messer]] succeeded Sweeney as director of the museum (but not the foundation) in 1961 and stayed for 27 years, the longest tenure of any of the city's major arts institutions' directors.&lt;ref name=BioInContext&gt;{{Citation |chapter= Thomas M. Messer |title=The Writers Directory |location= Detroit |publisher= [[St. James Press]] |year= 2011 |format=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale Biography In Context Web]] |accessdate=April 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Messer took over, the museum's ability to present art at all was still in doubt due to the challenges presented by continuous spiral ramp gallery that is both tilted and has curved walls.&lt;ref name=Russell1987a&gt;{{Citation |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/05/arts/director-of-guggenheim-retiring-after-27-years.html |accessdate=April 14, 2012 |first= John |last= Russell |title=Director of Guggenheim Retiring After 27 Years |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= November 5, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost immediately, in 1962, he took a risk putting on a large exhibition that combined the Guggenheim's paintings with sculptures on loan from the [[Hirshhorn Museum]].&lt;ref name=Russell1987a/&gt; Three-dimensional sculpture, in particular, raised "the problem of installing such a show in a museum bearing so close a resemblance to the [[Inferno (Dante)#Overview and vestibule of Hell|circular geography of hell]]", where any vertical object appears tilted in a "drunken lurch" because the slope of the floor and the curvature of the walls could combine to produce vexing optical illusions.&lt;ref name=Canaday1962&gt;{{Citation |title= Museum Director Solves Problem; Guggenheim Official Faces Troubles of Architecture |first= John |last= Canaday |date= August 17, 1962 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |pages= 25, 47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It turned out that the combination could work well in the Guggenheim's space, but, Messer recalled that at the time, "I was scared. I half felt that this would be my last exhibition."&lt;ref name=Russell1987a/&gt; Messer had the foresight to prepare by staging a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, in which he discovered how to compensate for the space's weird geometry by constructing special [[plinth]]s at a particular angle, so the pieces were not at a true vertical yet appeared to be so.&lt;ref name=Canaday1962/&gt; In the earlier sculpture show, this trick proved impossible for one piece, an [[Alexander Calder]] [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] whose wire inevitably hung at a true [[Plumb-bob|plumb]] vertical, "suggesting hallucination" in the disorienting context of the tilted floor.&lt;ref name=Canaday1962/&gt;

The next year, Messer acquired a private collection from art dealer Justin K. Thannhauser for the foundation's permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, Andrew.

==Architecture==
The foundation has long sought, in its constituent museums, to unite its artworks with distinguished architecture.  In 1943, Hilla von Rebay and Solomon R. Guggenheim commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to build the foundation's first permanent museum.&lt;ref&gt;Bianchini, Riccardo. [http://www.inexhibit.com/case-studies/the-guggenheim-museum-an-american-revolution/ "The Guggenheim Museum, an American Revolution"], Inexhibit museum magazine, accessed July 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Rebay wrote to Wright that "each of these great masterpieces should be organized into space, and only you ... would test the possibilities to do so. …  I want a temple of spirit, a monument!"&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant achievement, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York City, testifies not only to Wright's architectural genius, but also to the adventurous spirit that characterized its founders.&lt;ref name="Levine, p. 362"&gt;Levine, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;  The critic [[Paul Goldberger]] later wrote that, before Wright's modernist building, "there were only two common models for museum design: [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-arts]] Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion."&lt;ref name=Secret&gt;[https://archive.is/20130119180543/http://www.colebrookbossonsaunders.com/The-Secret-Life-of-Buildings-New-York-Public-Library-and-Guggenheim "The Secret Life of Buildings: New York Public Library and Guggenheim Museum"], Colebrook Bosson Saunders Products Ltd.. Retrieved March 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldberger thought the building a catalyst for change, making it "socially and culturally acceptable for an architect to design a highly expressive, intensely personal museum. In this sense almost every museum of our time is a child of the Guggenheim."&lt;ref name=Secret/&gt;

[[Image:guggenheim flw show.jpg|thumb|right|An interior view of the museum]]
Before settling on the present site for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue between 88th and 89th Streets, Wright, Rebay and Guggenheim considered numerous locations in Manhattan, as well as in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, overlooking the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name=Ballon&gt;Ballon, pp. 22–27&lt;/ref&gt;  Guggenheim felt that the site's proximity to Central Park was important;  the park afforded relief from the noise, congestion and concrete of the city.&lt;ref name=Storrer401&gt;Storrer, pp. 400–01&lt;/ref&gt;  Nature also provided the museum with inspiration.&lt;ref name=Ballon/&gt; The building embodies Wright's attempts "to render the inherent plasticity of organic forms in architecture."&lt;ref name=Levine340&gt;Levine, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guggenheim was to be the only museum designed by Wright.  The city location required Wright to design the building in a vertical rather than a horizontal form, far different from his earlier, rural works.&lt;ref name=Storrer401/&gt;

Wright's original concept was called an inverted "[[ziggurat]]", because it resembled the steep steps on the ziggurats built in ancient [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=Storrer401/&gt; His design dispensed with the conventional approach to museum layout, in which visitors are led through a series of interconnected rooms and forced to retrace their steps when exiting.&lt;ref name=Levine340/&gt;  Wright's plan was for the museum guests to ride to the top of the building by elevator, to descend at a leisurely pace along the gentle slope of the continuous ramp, and to view the atrium of the building as the last work of art.

Even as it embraced nature, Wright's design also expresses his take on modernist architecture's rigid geometry.&lt;ref name=Levine301/&gt;  Wright ascribed a symbolic meaning to the building's shapes.  He explained, "these geometric forms suggest certain human ideas, moods, sentiments – as for instance: the circle, infinity; the triangle, structural unity; the spiral, organic progress; the square, integrity."&lt;ref&gt;Rudenstine, Angelica Zander.

However, as part of the restoration, architects [[Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates Architects|Gwathmey Siegel and Associates]] analyzed Wright's original sketches to design the rectangular 10-story limestone tower, that stands behind, and taller than, the original spiral building (replacing a much smaller structure), which has four additional exhibition galleries with flat walls that are "more appropriate for the display of art."&lt;ref name=GSwebsite/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArchDaily/&gt;  Also in the original construction, the main gallery skylight had been covered, which compromised Wight's carefully articulated lighting effects.

After her resignation in 1979, she became a businesswoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hln.be/tag/terry-van-ginderen|title=Terry Van Ginderen - HLN|website=www.hln.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1989, when she founded [[Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij|VTM]] she worked for this channel, again for children's programs, but she also appeared in various juries of game programs. In 1992, she became manager of [[Silvy De Bie|Silvy Melody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/Obits/-tante--terry-van-ginderen-overleden|title=Televisiepionier "Tante" Terry Van Ginderen is overleden|first=VRT|last=NWS|date=30 January 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Battery''' (also commonly known as '''Battery Park''') is a {{Convert|25|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[public park]] located at the southern tip of [[Manhattan#Manhattan Island|Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]] facing [[New York Harbor]].  The park and surrounding area is named for the [[artillery battery|artillery batteries]] that were positioned there in the city's early years to protect the settlement behind them.

The Battery Conservancy, founded in 1994 by current President Warrie Price, has undertaken and funded the restoration and improvement of the once-dilapidated park. The park was known as "Battery Park" until 2015, when the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] restored the park's original, historical title of "The Battery".

==History==
[[File:View of Battery Park 1793.jpg|thumb|1793 rendering of the flagpole and recent plantings at the Battery]]
The southern shoreline of Manhattan Island had been known as "The Battery" since the 17th century when the area was part of the Dutch Settlement of [[New Amsterdam]]. At the time, an [[artillery battery]] there served to protect the seaward approaches to the town.&lt;ref name="Transformation"/&gt; The Battery continued its function during the colonial era, and was the center of [[Evacuation Day (New York)|Evacuation Day]] celebrations commemorating the departure of the last British troops in the United States after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Just prior to the [[War of 1812]], the West Battery, later renamed [[Castle Clinton]], was erected on a small artificial offshore island nearby, to replace the earlier batteries in the area; later, when the Battery's landmass was created, it encircled and incorporated the island.&lt;ref name="Transformation" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tb&gt;[http://www.thebattery.org/the-battery/history/ History of The Battery], The Battery Conservancy. Retrieved December 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relatively modern Battery was mostly created by [[land reclamation|landfill]] starting from 1855, resulting in a landscaped open space at the foot of the heavily developed mainland of downtown. [[Skyscraper]]s now occupy most of the original land, stopping abruptly where the park begins. On State Street, the former harbor front and the northern boundary of the park, a single Federal mansion, the [[James Watson House]], survives as part of the Shrine of Saint [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]]; until the 1820s, the city's stylish residential district was north of this house, between Broadway and the [[Hudson River]].

While the [[Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel]] and [[Battery Park Underpass]] were under construction from 1940–52, the park was partly closed; it was later re-landscaped and expanded by {{convert|2|acre|ha}}. Peter Minuit Plaza was built in 1955; the [[#East Coast Memorial|East Coast Memorial]] was dedicated in 1963. The Battery was included within a "group of historic waterfront sites" designated Harbor Park, by the government of New York State, in 1982.&lt;ref name=nycparks&gt;[http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/battery-park/history Battery Park], [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]. Retrieved December 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The park was renamed from "Battery Park" to "The Battery" in April 2015.&lt;ref name="Transformation"/&gt;

==In the park==
Toward the northwestern end of the park is [[Castle Clinton]], the often-repurposed last remnant of the defensive works which inspired the name of the park; the former fireboat station [[City Pier A|Pier A]]; and Hope Garden, a memorial to [[AIDS]] victims. The Battery Gardens restaurant, next to the United States Coast Guard Battery Building. Along the waterfront, [[Statue Cruises]] offers [[ferry|ferries]] to the [[Statue of Liberty]] and [[Ellis Island]]. The park is also the site of the East Coast Memorial which commemorates U.S. servicemen who died in coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean during [[World War II]], and several other memorials. The [[SeaGlass Carousel]], a site-specific attraction that opened on August 20, 2015, is designed to resemble an under-the-sea garden through which visitors ride on fish shimmering as though they were [[bioluminescent]],&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/arts/design/new-yorks-new-carousel-puts-you-in-a-whirling-school-of-mechanized-fish.html|title=New York's New Carousel Puts You in a Whirling School of Mechanized Fish|date=August 13, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Dunlap|first=David|authorlink=David W.

=== Castle Clinton ===
[[File:Battery Park 002.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|The aquarium used to be housed in [[Castle Clinton]] (image before 1923)]]
Castle Clinton, named for mayor [[DeWitt Clinton]], now lies within the park. Originally called the West Battery, it was built as a fort just prior to the War of 1812. It became property of the city after the war and was renamed Castle Clinton. When leased by the city, it became a popular [[promenade]] and [[beer garden]]. Later roofed over, it became one of the premier [[Theater in the United States|theatrical venues in the United States]] and contributed greatly to the development of New York City as the theater capital of the nation.

{{quote|After a New York [[clipper]] had finished loading, it was the custom for her to drop down the East River and anchor off The Battery, then a fashionable resort, where she would remain for a few hours to take her crew on board and usually to ship between five and ten tons of gunpowder ... The people who gathered at The Battery to see a clipper ship get underway came partly to hear the sailors sing their sea songs, or [[Sea shanty|chanties]] ... which originated early in the nineteenth century, with the Negro [[stevedore]]s at Mobile and New Orleans ... As the ship pays off, and gathers way in the slack water, the longshoremen and runners tumble over the side into the [[Whitehall rowboat|Whitehall boats]], the crowd at Battery Park gives three parting cheers, the ensign is dipped, and the clipper is on her way to [[Cape Horn]].&lt;ref&gt;

The migration of the city's elite uptown increased concurrently with the mass European emigration of the middle 19th century. As [[immigrants]] settled the Battery, the location was less favorable to theater patrons and Castle Garden was closed. The structure was then made into the world's first immigration depot, processing millions of immigrants beginning in 1855, almost 40 years before its successor, [[Ellis Island]], opened its doors. This period coincided with immigration waves resulting from [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Ireland's Great Famine]] and other pivotal European events. The structure then housed the [[New York Aquarium]] from 1896 to 1941, when it was threatened with destruction under transportation planner [[Robert Moses]]'s plans.&lt;ref name=tb /&gt;&lt;ref name=nycparks /&gt;

Made a [[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]] in 1946 and restored in 1975,&lt;ref name=tb /&gt; Castle Clinton currently known by its original name and managed by the [[National Park Service]]. It contains a small history exhibit and occasionally hosts concerts. As the site of the ticket office for ferries to the [[Statue of Liberty]] and [[Ellis Island]], it recorded nearly 4.08 million visitors in 2009. According to data from the National Park Service, that made Castle Clinton the most popular National Monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://batteryparkcity.com/news/castle-clinton-and-statue-of-liberty-most-popular-monuments/|title=Castle Clinton, Statue of Liberty Are Most Popular US Monuments|work=Battery Park City News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====East Coast Memorial====
A World War II [[war memorial]], the East Coast Memorial is one of three war memorials in the United States administered by the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]]; the others are the [[West Coast Memorial to the Missing of World War II]] in [[San Francisco]] and the [[Honolulu Memorial]]. The memorial commemorates U.S. servicemen who died in coastal waters of the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. A total of 4,609 names are inscribed on both sides of eight 19-foot-tall granite pylons. The pylons are arranged in two rows of four each. Between the two rows stands a bronze statue of an eagle, erected on a black granite pedestal. The eagle faces the [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.abmc.gov/memorials/memorials/ec.php East Coast Memorial] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121195725/http://www.abmc.gov/memorials/memorials/ec.php |date=January 21, 2014 }}," American Battle Monuments Commission website, and "[http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=11995 East Coast Memorial]," New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation website&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial was designed by the architectural firm of Gehron &amp; Seltzer. The eagle statue was created by [[Albino Manca]], an Italian-born sculptor. The granite slabs were set up in October 1959, while the sculpture was installed on February 4, 1963. The memorial was dedicated by President [[John F. Kennedy]] on May 23, 1963 at a ceremony which included addresses by New York mayor [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.]], Senate majority leader [[Mike Mansfield]], and the President. The destroyer [[USS Mitscher (DL-2)|USS ''Mitscher'']] fired a salute from nearby offshore.&lt;ref&gt;"Kennedy, in City, Honors War Dead," ''The New York Times'', May 24, 1963, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|American Merchant Marine Veterans Memorial}}

The American Merchant Mariners' Memorial sculpture, located in the [[Hudson River]] west of the park, is sited on a stone breakwater just south of [[City Pier A|Pier A]] and connected to the pier by a dock. It was designed by the sculptor [[Marisol Escobar]] and dedicated on October 8, 1991. The bronze sculpture depicts four merchant seamen with their sinking vessel after it had been attacked by a [[U-boat]] during [[World War II]]. One of the seamen is in the water, and is covered by the sea with each high tide. The sculpture is loosely based on a real photograph of crewmen of the ''SS Muskogee'' that was taken by the commander of an attacking submarine. All died at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/nyregion/fyi-599093.html?pagewanted=2|title=F.Y.I.|date=December 12, 1993|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial was commissioned by the American Merchant Mariners' Memorial, Inc., chaired by [[AFL–CIO]] president [[Lane Kirkland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=9745 American Merchant Mariners’ Memorial], New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation&lt;/ref&gt;

Other memorials include the Korean War Memorial dedicated to veterans of that conflict, located just north of Castle Clinton; a statue of [[John Ericsson]], designer and innovator of [[ironclad warship]]s; the Walloon Monument, dedicated to [[Jessé de Forest]] for his contributions to the founding of New York City; a 1909 statue of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], the first European to sail into [[New York Harbor]]; a World War II Coast Guard Memorial; and a monument to Veteran Wireless Operators who went down with their ships.

At least ten monuments, including the Verrazzano, Coast Guard and Wireless memorials, were stored in the park behind a temporary fence from 2004 or 2005 until 2016 as the result of a long-term renovation of Battery Park. Controversy over the statues' integrity arose in 2015 after renovations took longer than expected. Representatives of NYC Park Advocates and the Italian-American organization [[Unico National|UNICO]] expressed concern about the statues' condition, although experts said there should be no long-term physical harm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/02/06/seen-at-11-why-are-nyc-war-memorials-sitting-stashed-away-in-battery-park/ Why Are NYC War Memorials Sitting Stashed Away In Battery Park?], WCBS-TV local news, February 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The monuments have since been installed in or around the perimeter of the park, although not necessarily in their previous locations.

===Around the park===
[[File:Jwatsonhouse.JPG|thumb|left|The [[James Watson House]], 1793–1806, attributed to [[John McComb Jr.]], and adjoining shrine to St. [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]] face Battery Park]]

To the northwest of the park lies [[Battery Park City]], a planned community built on landfill in the 1970s and '80s, which includes Robert F. Wagner Park and the Battery Park City Promenade. Battery Park City was named after the park. Together with [[Hudson River Park]], a system of greenspaces, bikeways, and promenades now extend up the [[Hudson River]] shoreline. A [[bikeway]] might be built through the park that will connect the [[Hudson River Park]] and [[East River Greenway]] parts of the [[Manhattan Waterfront Greenway]].

Across State Street to the northeast is [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]], as well as the old [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House|U.S. Customs House]], now used as a branch of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] and the district U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Peter Minuit Plaza abuts the southeast end of the park, directly in front of the [[Staten Island Ferry]]'s [[Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal|Whitehall Terminal]] at [[South Ferry (Manhattan)|South Ferry]].

===Under the park===

The Battery, due to its key location, has played an important role in the construction of transportation infrastructure. Under the park and immediate surrounding area lies the following active infrastructure:

* The [[Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel]], opened 1941, carrying vehicular traffic to [[Brooklyn]].
* The [[Battery Park Underpass]], opened 1951, carrying vehicular traffic from [[West Street]] to the [[FDR Drive]].
* At the [[New York City Subway]]'s old [[South Ferry loops (New York City Subway)|South Ferry station]], opened 1905, the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line|Broadway–Seventh Avenue]] and [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line|Lexington Avenue Lines]] have a [[balloon loop]] to enable trains to turn around and switch between the two [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]] lines. It closed in June 2017.
* The [[South Ferry (IRT Broadway&amp;ndash;Seventh Avenue Line)|South Ferry]] subway station on the Broadway&amp;ndash;Seventh Avenue Line, opened 2009, created a new free connection with the [[BMT Broadway Line]]'s [[Whitehall Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Whitehall Street]] station. The two stations comprise the [[South Ferry/Whitehall Street (New York City Subway)|South Ferry/Whitehall Street]] subway complex ({{NYCS trains|South Ferry}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://forgotten-ny.com/2009/07/new-and-old-downtown-wall-street-and-south-ferry/ New and Old Downtown: Wall Street and South Ferry]. Forgotten NY. Retrieved June 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the MTA also added a connection from the rest of the station complex to the old South Ferry station, while the new station was closed as an effect of [[Effects of Hurricane Sandy in New York|Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Old South Ferry Station to Reopen for Service in early April |url=http://mta.info/nyct/service/SouthFerryStationReopenApril2013.htm |publisher=New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority |date=March 8, 2013 |accessdate=March 8, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312015054/http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/SouthFerryStationReopenApril2013.htm |archivedate=March 12, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new station reopened in 2017, resulting in the closure of the old station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc7ny.com/news/south-ferry-subway-station-in-manhattan-reopens/2153353/ |title=South Ferry subway station in Manhattan reopens |publisher=ABC 7 New York |date=June 27, 2017|access-date=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Bowling Green (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Bowling Green]] subway station, opened 1905 and serving the {{NYCS trains|Lexington south}}, is at the northeast corner of the park. Its original entrance, or "[[Battery Park Control House|Control House]]" is an official city landmark. Tracks leading south of the station go to both the old South Ferry station and to the [[Joralemon Street Tunnel]], which skirts the park before traveling under the [[East River]].

====Discovery of wall====
[[File:South_Ferry_artwork_3_vc.jpg|thumb|left|A piece of the old wall, used as artwork in the new South Ferry subway station]]

On December 8, 2005, New York City authorities announced that builders working on the new South Ferry station had found the remains of a 200-year-old stone wall.&lt;ref name="amny 20100226"&gt;{{cite news |title=Unearthing Colonial New York: South Ferry Project Yields 65K Artifacts |url=http://www.archaeologydaily.com/news/201002263403/Unearthing-colonial-New-York-South-Ferry-project-yields-65K-artifacts.html |newspaper=AM New York |date=February 26, 2010 |accessdate=May 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021032203/http://www.archaeologydaily.com/news/201002263403/Unearthing-colonial-New-York-South-Ferry-project-yields-65K-artifacts.html |archivedate=October 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After archaeological analysis, it was widely reported to be the oldest man-made structure still in place in Manhattan. Four walls and over 250,000 individual artifacts were found in the excavation of the South Ferry subway station. A portion of one wall was placed on temporary display inside Castle Clinton. In 2009, a long portion of wall was embedded permanently into the wall of the entrance to the newly constructed station, at the same depth below street level as originally discovered.

Robert Tierney, chairman of the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], said that the wall was probably built to protect the 17th- and 18th-century artillery batteries from which the park's name is derived. The city and the [[New York City Transit Authority]] plan to work together to preserve the remains, which were described as "an important remnant of the history of New York City".&lt;ref name="amny 20100226" /&gt;

In business, '''training simulation''' is a virtual medium through which various types of skills can be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Gopinath, C. and Sawyer, J. (1999). ''Exploring the Learning from an Enterprise Simulation, Journal of Management Development''&lt;/ref&gt; Training simulations can be used in a variety of genres; however they are most commonly&lt;ref&gt;Henfrey, Richard (1989). ''"Executive" simulation'', Executive Development, Vol. 3 Iss: 2&lt;/ref&gt; used in corporate situations to improve [[business]] awareness and [[management]] skills. They are also common in academic environments as an integrated part of a business or management course.

The word [[simulation]] implies an imitation of a real-life process, usually via a computer or other technological device, in order to provide a [[lifelike experience]]. This has proven to be a reliable and successful method of training in thousands of industries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Ellet, Bill (1997). ''TMR Shortlist of Business Simulations'', Training Media Review Publications&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used both to allow specialization in a certain area, and to educate individuals in the workings of the sectors as a whole, making training simulations versatile. Training simulations are not just games;&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (1999). ''Three Easy Pieces: A Taxonomy of Gaming''. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) ''The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning''&lt;/ref&gt; their aim is to educate and inform in an exciting and memorable way, rather than purely to entertain.

__TOC__

==Purpose==

Companies across the world regularly use simulations as a tool to teach employees.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Elizabeth, O’Loughlin, Andrew and McFadzean, Elspeth (2005). ''[http://www.pogc.ir/portals/0/maghalat/890706-2.pdf Corporate Entrepreneurship and Innovation Part 2: A Role- and Process-based Approach]'', European Journal of Innovation Management, Vol. 8 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; With the enormous range of simulation-based activities available, it is unsurprising that the specific aims of the sessions vary widely. Some simulations are focused on [[decision making|making decisions]] in a particular area of the business, such as personnel or [[product design]], and these are called ''Functional Simulations''. Others give a general overview of a company and give experience of making executive management decisions, and are called ''Total Enterprise Simulations''.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, William D. (1990).'' [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.455.1754&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Introduction to Computerized Business Management Simulations].'' In Gentry (ed.) ''Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning''&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, this classification has become somewhat impractical, as increasing numbers of training simulations are involving both elements, and combining both an overall view of the industry with some decisions relating to specific sectors.

Training Simulations normally form part of a program designed to educate employees or students about the skills needed to operate a business, as well as persuade them to "[[think outside the box]]" and see the bigger picture.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Graham A. ''Home and Away: Application of the Executive Simulation for Education and Training Purposes in Dundee and Malaysia''&lt;/ref&gt; This can make for a better organized, more fluid system in which all employees understand their part in making the company successful.


 
Although the most common use for training simulations is in a [[corporate]] setting,&lt;ref&gt;Declan Doyle, F. William Brown, (2000). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/F_Brown/publication/235314940_Using_a_business_simulation_to_teach_applied_skills_-_The_benefits_and_the_challenges_of_using_student_teams_from_multiple_countries/links/0deec52a5e16008bae000000/Using-a-business-simulation-to-teach-applied-skills-The-benefits-and-the-challenges-of-using-student-teams-from-multiple-countries.pdf Using a business simulation to teach applied skills – the benefits and the challenges of using student teams from multiple countries]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 24 Iss: 6&lt;/ref&gt; simulation games are increasingly being used to educate young people about the importance of business. From secondary school age all the way up to [[MBA]] students, anyone can benefit from the first-hand experience of running a company and making decisions that directly affect performance.&lt;ref&gt;Prohaska, Charles R. and Frank, Ellen J. (1990). ''[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1046878190211004 Using Simulations to Investigate Management Decision Making]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 21 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow the participants to gain an overall understanding of the business world, and give some insight into the type of skills that are necessary to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Elgood, Chris (1996). ''Using Management Games''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to note that ‘beating the game’ should not be a primary aim for anyone taking part in a simulation; the focus should be directed towards everyone gaining some useful and relevant knowledge that they can take away and use in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Michael J. R. and Reddy, Peter (2010). ''[http://eprints.aston.ac.uk/20147/1/Butler__Reddy_JEIT_-_Developing_Critical_Understanding_through_EBL_and_Storytelling.pdf Developing Critical Understanding in HRM Students: Using Innovative Teaching Methods to Encourage Deep Approaches to Study]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 34 Iss: 8/9&lt;/ref&gt; If the simulation does have a competitive element, it is to motivate and inspire, rather than encourage any malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;Hynes, Briga, Costin, Yvonne and Birdthistle, Naomi (2011). ''Practice-based Learning in Entrepreneurship Education: A Means of Connecting Knowledge Producers and Users''. Higher Education, Skills and Work-based Learning, Vol. 1 Iss: 1&lt;/ref&gt; Some training activities are non-competitive to avoid this, however many noted experts in the field state that the rivalry between teams or individuals improves the learning experience and adds a sense of fun and drama into the simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, D. J. (1997). ''Group Competitiveness and Cohesion in a Business Simulation''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 28 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly important when working with young people such as students, as they often require an extra boost to keep them entertained, especially when a simulation is run over an extended period.

==Development==

The concept of training employees to have a wider perspective on their position within the workplace has been around for hundreds of years,&lt;ref&gt;Keys, Bernard and Wolfe, Joseph (1990). ''The Role of Management Games and Simulations in Education and Research''. Journal of Management, Vol. 16, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; but it is only relatively recently that the idea of creating a simulated environment for trainees to test their abilities and skills has been developed. The first commercially available training simulation was in 1956, and was called ''The Top Management Decision Game'', and was created by the [[American Management Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Naylor, Thomas H. (1971). ''Computer Simulation Experiments with Models of Economic Systems''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the market has expanded hugely, with thousands of simulations available based upon hundreds of different industries. Initially simple with just a few choices to make, some simulations have become extremely complex with many different interlinking decisions. When training simulations were first used, they involved paper forms that were filled in by the participants and then compared by the organizer of the exercise. Nowadays, nearly all simulations are [[computer]] based,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, John M. (2007). ''Business Simulations - Do They Have a Place in Training?''&lt;/ref&gt; and involve multi-stage algorithms that calculate performance based on the decisions entered.&lt;ref&gt;Fripp, John (1997). ''A Future for Business Simulations?'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 21 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Most simulations are based around a real [[industry]], and hence they use real data to be as accurate as possible and to provide a realistic experience. However, some remain generic and do not model a particular industry, although these tend to be more useful for younger players or those with absolutely no business knowledge.

==Integrated==

Most corporations and academic courses that contain a training simulation integrate it into an existing or completely new training programme.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A. J. (1987). ''A Survey of the Use of Business Games in Academia and Business''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 18 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the participants to get the maximum value from the experience, as well as review the sessions in order to improve them for future use. The structure of a training session would normally be as follows:

* '''Introduction:''' the organizer of the program (plus sometimes a specialist in the training simulation) will meet the participants and give them a brief explanation of the purposes behind the training and what they should hope to achieve.
* '''Lectures:''' sometimes the trainees will also receive one or more lectures around the topics that the simulation will be based on, in order to give them an idea of the type of skills they will need. This is especially important within academia, when the students will often be examined on this section after the event.
* '''The simulation:''' the simulation will then be played, allowing newly acquired knowledge to be tested and skills practiced. A positive atmosphere is vital here to maintain enthusiasm.
* '''Evaluation:''' once the simulation has been completed, it is important to summarize what has been learnt and the effectiveness of the training. Presenting results to others may provide a means of internal assessment, as well as showcasing the players’ achievements.

This integrated [[training]] will allow everyone taking part in the simulation to get the maximum experience possible, as well as being entertaining, exciting and giving them a new perspective on the business world. Many companies that specialize in training simulations also offer to create a special integrated plan unique to the client,&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler, I (2005). ''[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8bc/e727abf8da27f3dc4497b00499129fd31d78.pdf Development of an asset management strategy for a network utility company: Lessons from a dynamic business simulation approach]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 36 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; to make the process as streamlined and efficient as possible.

==Benefits==

Since training simulations are available based on such a wide range of different industries, and with thousands of different aims and objectives, it is difficult to outline a specific skill-set that will be improved by taking part in a training simulation. However, skills that good training simulations should build on include:

* '''Business awareness''' – before participating in the training programme, many players will have little idea of how to run a business or what it involves. Simulations allow them to temporarily have control over a virtual company, to see whether their decisions lead them to success or failure!&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Natalia, Escudero, Anna, Barahona, Juan and Leitao, Fernando (2009). ''[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090590910950578 The Effect of Entrepreneurship Education Programmes on Satisfaction with Innovation, Behaviour and Performance]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 33 Iss: 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Time management and organization''' – most simulations contain timed sessions, which will test the candidates’ skill in submitting decisions within the allotted time slot.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Lynn, Marcia and Sigelman, Lee (1991). ''Computer Simulation Applications, An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt; This is an excellent skill for any employee or graduate.
* '''Team coordination''' – the majority of training simulations involve working in groups or teams of people;&lt;ref&gt;Wellington, W. J. and Faria, A. J. (1992). ''An Examination on the Effect of Team Cohesion, Player Attitude and Performance Expectations on Simulation Performance Results''&lt;/ref&gt; improving the abilities to communicate effectively, delegate tasks and diplomatically resolve any situations.
* '''Problem solving''' – simulations will often present tricky circumstances that must be thought through logically to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A. J. (2001). ''[http://www.coulthard.com/library/Files/faria_2001_thechangingnatureofbusinesssimulationgamingresearch.pdf The Changing Nature of Business Simulation/Gaming Research: A Brief History]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 32 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Successful resolution of these shows good management skills.
 
If every participant improves in these four key skill areas, the training programme will be a success, and any business should notice an improvement in efficiency and motivation, and students will be inspired and animated.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Simulation Means Better Senior Managers at Heinz'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 23 Iss: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14231">'''Values scales''' are psychological inventories used to determine the values that people endorse in their [[personal life | lives]].  They facilitate the understanding of both work and general [[values]] that individuals uphold.  In addition, they assess the importance of each value in people's lives and how the individual strives toward fulfillment through work and other life roles, such as parenting.&lt;ref name="SuperDonald"&gt;Super, Donald and Dorothy D. Nevill.  "Brief Description of Purpose and Nature of Test." ''Consulting Psychologists Press'.' 1989:  3-10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scales have been normalized and can therefore be used cross-culturally for [[vocational]], [[marketing]], and [[counseling]] purposes, yielding unbiased results.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"&gt;Beatty, Sharon E., et al. "Alternative Measurement Approaches to Consumer Values: The List of Values and the Rokeach Value Survey." Psychology and Marketing. 1985: 181-200. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychologists]], [[political scientists]], [[economists]], and others interested in defining values, use values scales to determine what people value, and to evaluate the ultimate function or purpose of values.&lt;ref&gt;
Johnston, Charles S. "The Rokeach Value Survey: Underlying Structure and Multidimensional Scaling."  ''The Journal of Psychology''. 1995: 583-597. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

Values scales were first developed by an international group of [[psychologists]] whose goal was to create a unique [[self-report]] instrument that measured [[intrinsic]] and [[extrinsic]] values for use in the lab and in the clinic.  The psychologists called their project the [[Work Importance Study]] (WIS).  The original values scale measured the following values, listed in alphabetical order:  ability utilization, achievement, advancement, [[aesthetics]], [[altruism]], [[authority]], [[autonomy]], [[creativity]], [[cultural identity]], economic rewards, economic security, life style, personal development, [[physical activity]], physical prowess, prestige, [[risk]], [[social interaction]], [[social relations]], variety, and [[working conditions]].  Some of the listed values were intended to be inter-related, but conceptually differentiable.&lt;ref name="SuperDonald" /&gt;

Since the original Work Importance Study, several scientists have supplemented the study by creating their own scale or by deriving and improving the original format.  Theorists and psychologists often study values, values scales, and the field surrounding values, otherwise known as [[axiology]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Kopelman, Richard E., et al. “The Study of Values: Construction of the fourth edition.” ''Journal of Vocational Behavior.'' 2003: 203-220. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  New studies have even been published recently, updating the work in the field.  Dr. Eda Gurel-Atay published an article in the ''Journal of Advertising Research'' in March 2010, providing a glimpse into how social values have changed between 1976 and 2007.  The paper explained how “self-respect” has been on the upswing, while “a sense of belonging” has become less important to individuals.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1976"&gt;Gurel-Atay, Eda. “Changes in Social Values in the United States: 1976-2007, Self-Respect is on the Upswing as “A Sense of Belonging” Becomes Less Important.”  ''Journal of Advertising Research.'' 2010: 57-67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rokeach ===

According to social psychologist [[Milton Rokeach]], [[human values]] are defined as “core conceptions of the desirable within every individual and society.  They serve as standards or criteria to guide not only action but also judgment, choice, attitude, evaluation, argument, exhortation, rationalization, and…attribution of causality.”&lt;ref&gt;Rokeach, M. “The Nature of Human Values.” ''The Free Press.'' NY: Free Press. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1973 publication, Rokeach also stated that the consequences of human values would be manifested in all phenomena that social scientists might consider worth investigating.  In order for any type of research to be successful, regardless of the field of study, people’s underlying values needed to be understood.  To allow for this, Rokeach created the [[Rokeach Value Survey]] (RVS), which has been in use for more than 30 years.  It provides a theoretical perspective on the nature of values in a cognitive framework and consists of two sets of values – 18 instrumental and 18 terminal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Clawson, C. J., &amp; Vinson, D. E. (1978). Human Values: a Historical and Interdisciplinary Analysis. ''North America - Advances in Consumer Research'', ''5'', 396–402. Retrieved from http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=9454&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumental values are beliefs or conceptions about desirable modes of behavior that are instrumental to the attainment of desirable end points, such as honesty, responsibility, and capability.  Terminal values are beliefs or conceptions about ultimate goals of existence that are worth surviving for, such as happiness, self-respect, and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Piirto, Jane. “I Live in My Own Bubble: The Values of Talented Adolescents.” ''The Journal of Secondary Gifted Education.'' 2005: 106-118. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The value survey asks subjects to rank the values in order of importance to them.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The actual directions are as follows: “Rank each value in its order of importance to you.  Study the list and think of how much each value may act as a guiding principle in your life.”&lt;ref&gt;Rokeach, M. “The Nature of Human Values.” ''The Free Press''. NY: Free Press. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Rokeach Value Survey has been criticized because people are often not able to rank each value clearly.  Some values may be equally important, while some values may be equally unimportant, and so on.  Presumably, people are more certain of their most extreme values (i.e. what they love and what they hate) and are not so certain of the ones  “in between.”  Further, [[C.J. Clawson]] and [[Donald E. Vinson]] showed that the Rokeach Value Survey omitted a number of values that a large portion of the population holds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

=== Schwartz ===
[[Image:Shalom H Schwartz.jpg|thumb|alt=Shalom_H_Schwartz|Frame|Shalom H. Schwartz]]
[[Shalom H. Schwartz]], social psychologist and author of ''[[The Structure of Human Values: Origins and Implications]]'' and ''[[Theory of Basic Human Values]]'', has done research on [[universal values]] and how they exist in a wide variety of contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, S.H. "Are There Universal Aspects in the Content and Structure of Values?" ''Journal of Social Issues.'' 1994: 19-45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his work addressed broad questions about values, such as: how are individuals’ priorities affected by social experiences?  How do individuals’ priorities influence their behavior and choices?  And, how do value priorities influence [[ideologies]], attitudes, and actions in political, religious, environmental, and other domains?  Through his studies, Schwartz concluded that ten types of universal values exist: achievement, benevolence, conformity, [[hedonism]], power, security, self-direction, stimulation, tradition, and [[universalism]].  Schwartz also tested the possibility of [[spirituality]] as an eleventh universal value, but found that it did not exist in all cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Shalom H. “Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: Theoretical Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries.”  ''Advances in Experimental Psychology.'' 1992: 1-65. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz's value theory and instruments are part of the biennial [[European Social Survey]].

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Spranger’s (1928) view that understanding the individual’s value philosophy best captures the essence of a person, Allport and his colleagues, Vernon and Lindzey, created the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values.  The values scale outlined six major value types: theoretical (discovery of truth), economic (what is most useful), aesthetic (form, beauty, and harmony), social (seeking love of people), political (power), and religious (unity).  Forty years after the study’s publishing in 1960, it was the third most-cited non-projective personality measure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

By 1980, the values scale had fallen into disuse due to its archaic content, lack of religious inclusiveness, and dated language. Richard E. Kopelman, et al., recently updated the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values. The motivation behind their update was to make the value scale more relevant to today; they believed that the writing was too dated.  The updated, copyrighted version was published in ''[[Elsevier Science]]'' in 2003.  Today, permission is required for use.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; (volume 62)

=== Hartman ===

[[Philosopher]] [[Robert S. Hartman]], creator of the [[Science of Value]], introduced and identified the concept of [[systematic values]], which he believed were an important addition to the previously studied intrinsic and extrinsic values.  He also made an illuminating distinction between ''what'' people value and ''how'' people value.  How people value parallels very closely with systematic values, which Hartman operationally defined as conceptual constructs or cognitive scripts that exist in people’s minds.  [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideal]]s, [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s, standards, rules, doctrines, and [[logic systems]] are all examples of systematic values.  If someone’s [[cognitive script]] is repetitively about violent actions, for instance, then that person is more likely to act vengefully and less likely to value peace.  With that additional idea in mind, Harman combined intrinsic, extrinsic, and systematic concepts to create the [[Hartman Value Profile]], also known as the [[Hartman Value Inventory]]. The profile consists of two parts. Each part contains 18 paired value-combination items, where nine of these items are positive and nine are negative.  The three different types of values, intrinsic, extrinsic, and systematic, can be combined positively or negatively with one another in 18 logically possible ways.  Depending on the combination, a certain value is either enhanced or diminished. Once the rankings are completed, the outcome is then compared to the theoretical norm, generating scores for psychological interpretation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

== Applications to psychology ==

Research surrounding understanding values serves as a framework for ideas in many other situations, such as counseling. [[Psychotherapists]], [[behavioral scientists]], and social scientists often deal with intrinsic, extrinsic, and systematic values of their patients.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, M.D. “Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck’s Values Orientation Theory.” ''Online Readings in Psychology and Culture.'' 2002. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; A primary way to learn about patients is to know what they value, as values are essential keys to personality structures.  This knowledge can pinpoint serious problems in living, aide immensely in planning therapeutic regimens, and measure therapeutic progress with applications of values scales over time, especially as [[social environments]] and [[social norms]] change.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

== Applications to business and marketing ==

Values are important in the construction of personal [[morality]] and as a basis for living life.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"/&gt; Recent literature suggests that social values are reflected in a large variety of advertisements and can influence audience reactions to advertising appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Hornikx, J., &amp; O’Keefe, D. J. (2009). Adapting consumer advertising appeals to cultural values: A meta-analytic review of effects on persuasiveness and ad liking. ''Annals of the International Communication Association, 33 (1),'' 38-71&lt;/ref&gt; When a choice is tied to a value, that choice then becomes more attractive to people who share that value.  [[Means-end chain analyses]] often find that consumers select products with attributes that deliver consequences, which in turn contribute to value fulfillment.  In short, people’s values resonate in and are observable throughout their daily lives.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; An example, presented in the ''[[Journal of Advertising Research]]'' by [[Eda Gurel-Atay]], is coffee.  People who endorse fun and enjoyment in life may want a cup of coffee for its rich, pleasant taste.  Meanwhile, people who value a sense of accomplishment may rather use coffee as a mild stimulant.  People who value warm, loving relationships with others may want a cup of coffee to share in a social manner.  Perspective and personal beliefs greatly influence behavior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1976"/&gt;

Clawson and Vinson (1978) further elaborated on this idea by explaining how values are one of the most powerful explanations of, and influences on, [[consumer behavior]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Values scales are helpful in understanding several aspects of [[consumption areas]] and consumer behavior, including [[leisure]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[gift giving]].  People who endorse certain values more highly than others engage in certain activities, prefer certain programs or magazines, or give gifts differently from others. Values scales and the study of values could also be of interest to companies who are looking to build or strengthen their [[customer relationship management]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:W.E.PereraParents.jpg|thumb|right|W. E. Perera's parents, Mr and Mrs W. Charles Perera]]
W. E. Perera was born in Telok Anson, Perak, to Weeratunge Charles Perera and his wife, Galgodliynage Marthina Perera. His father a contract railway engineer from [[Kotahena]], Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]) settled in Malaya (1880s) after accepting the permanent position as Head Guard of the railway between Teluk Anson and [[Tapah]] and later retiring as Chief Inspector, Permanent Ways, of the Malayan Railways.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook4"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his siblings, elder sister Margaret, and younger brothers Samuel, Joseph and Daniel grew up in [[Seremban]], [[Negri Sembilan]] where his father was subsequently transferred. W. E. Perera started his education at [[St. Francis Institution]], [[Malacca]] and then moved to [[St. Xavier's Institution]], [[Penang]] to complete his [[Senior Cambridge|Junior Cambridge]] exams. After passing the local government school leaving exams at Standard VII, at the direction of his father, he continued his studies whilst living in [[Perai|Prai]], [[Penang]] with his parents. He passed his Senior Cambridge Certificate exams on a second try during the height of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="message1966"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perera | first = W. Edward | title = Memoirs to the family |year = 1966| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I (1914–1918)===
The First World War came to Malaya at the [[battle of Penang]] on 28 October 1914. As he describes in his memoirs,&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;

{{quote|The First World War had broken out and I remember one morning at about 4.30 am when I was studying alone, my parents and brothers being all asleep I heard a loud explosion. Everybody was awakened by the noise and we opened the door and went outside and looked towards the seaside, when we saw flashes of light and heard more explosions. That was the bombardment of the Russian cruiser [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug|Zhemchug]] by the German pirate cruiser "[[SMS Emden (1908)|Emden]]". After the sinking of the Russian Cruiser, the German ship steamed out of the Harbour and disappeared before the British Man-of-War had time to catch up with her. That morning when we went to school we saw the dead bodies of the Russian sailors floating all over the sea between [[Butterworth, Penang|Butterworth]] and Penang. It was all excitement in Penang and our school closed for the day. We spent a good part of that morning at the harbour watching the marine police  and volunteers bringing ashore dead bodies. The single regiment of the [[Federation of Malaya]] known as the [[Malay States Guides]] which was stationed in [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] was quickly summoned to Penang. This regiment was composed of Moslem and Sikh soldiers. The Moslems were sent to guard [[Singapore]] and the Sikhs to guard Penang.}}

During this time W E Perera was a member of the Cadet Corps and through his friend Pertha Singh, befriended all the petty officers of the local guarding regiment frequently meeting with them in "one famous bar in those days known as Kee Kee Hotel", Penang.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;
Although being in the Commonwealth the sympathies of the locals were with the Germans during the early part of World War I.

{{quote|As soon as Turkey joined the war on the side of the Germans, the Moslem section of the Malay States Guides stationed in Singapore  mutinied and there was great commotion in the country. The volunteer company in Penang was called out for duty in Singapore and we in the Cadet Corps took on an appearance of importance. We were give more rifle practice, sham-fights and guard duties to perform.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;}}

After leaving school and short apprenticeships in engineering and surveying, his father arranged for him to join the Government service to apprentice under the Chief Clerk of the Railway Traffic office and later the Lands Office in Teluk Anson. Here, W. E. Perera learnt to buy and sell land, plant rubber and became conversant in the Malay language. He also applied to join the Army in an Anglo-Indian regiment being formed in India with volunteers from Malaya much to the disapproval of his father. However, his departure was delayed and later cancelled when the [[Armistice Day|Armistice]] was ratified with Germany.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On being transferred to Batu Gajah, he lived in his own quarters, socialised with the local Eurasian community, studied and experimented in  psychology, parapsychology, took up athletics and even music, playing the clarinet in a local band. He passed his clerical examinations and then completed a teaching diploma alongside doing a course in bookkeeping.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;

==Career and marriage==
[[File:W.E.PereraWedding.jpg|thumb|right|Mr and Mrs W. Edward Perera]]
W. E. Perera was employed by the [[Anglo-Chinese School, Ipoh|Rev. W. E. Horley]] as a teacher at the Methodist High School in Telok Anson.  By heeding the sound advice of his mentor Mr W. A. Rabel and friends, he saved enough money to invest in coconut and rubber plantations which he successfully ran whilst continuing his career as a teacher. This gave him financial independence to pursue various social activities like helping organise the Boy Scouts of Lower Perak and the Methodist Youth Fellowship, Telok Intan. In 1922, he created "The Cosmopolitan Club", Telok Anson, a multi-racial, secular social club much to the angst of the British who tried to keep the races separate. This gave him the opportunity to interact and befriend influential people from various social and ethnic groups like the Japanese, Chinese, Eurasians, Indians, Europeans, Malays and the Royalty of Teluk Anson.&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook5"&gt;{{cite book |

N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1928 after a brief visit to see his mother and sister in [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]], he met and eventually married Meepaygamay Kankananga Joci Perera (7 March 1908 – 6 January 1994) on 11 January 1929. They had 10  children: Minona, Jothika, Abhay, Wimala, Susimal,Tissa, Kimsuke, Jinamal, Kusala and Jaya in the years 1930 to 1947.

==The war years==

===Japanese invasion of Malaya (1942-1945)===
The war arrived to Telok Anson in form of air bombing raids by the Japanese Air Forces. Despite being instructed to leave Teluk Anson by the British district officer, W. E. Perera was one of a few people that boldly came out of hiding to help the unfortunate victims. He was a volunteer in the St Johns Ambulance at that time and months earlier had received training as a Superintendent of a medical unit which he put to good use.&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook6"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in one of his birthday messages:&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook7"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As soon as the Japanese invaders established a forward base at Telok Anson and the retreating British army had destroyed the water works at Changkat Jong, I don't know what prompted me to approach the Commander of the Japanese suicide Corps and warn him of the danger of the Japanese soldiers drinking the drain water, for the pollution would make them sick before they got to Singapore, their destination. In fact I was indirectly pleading for the safety of our own population. The Commander being an understanding man with knowledge of some English offered me a motor-car (all motor-cars including my own having been commandeered by the invaders) and a written order to collect workers and technicians to repair the waterworks and give water to the town immediately. He also provided me with all transport for the workers and a pass to allow us to travel without any molestation by their soldiers. I managed to find, and encourage a few workmen to come with me and we worked at Changkat Jong Headworks and several mains for three or four days working day and night and succeeded in giving water to Telok Anson to the relief of the Japanese as well as our own people. I enjoyed this thrill immensely.

Having obtained the ear of this Suicide Corps Commander, I pleaded with him to stop his soldiers from molesting the young girls in the town. I remember he told me that it was not possible for him to do as his men were going to die at the front but he suggested that I should form an interim government and appoint a mayor of the town. This would help to curb somewhat the behavior of his men. I lost no time in getting some of my friends in hiding to come forward for this task. We organised a sanitation brigade and the local police to function under the late Raja Yahaya as O.C.P.D. and Mr. J. Bahaduri a lawyer as the Mayor. This was another thrilling experience for me. About three months after the occupation of Perak, civil authorities arrived from Japan and organised the Government of Perak. The late Cik Megat Yunus was appointed the District Officer of Telok Anson.

Although I knew nothing of electricity, and the English schools were not functioning the late Cik Megat Yunus and [[Yusuf Izzuddin Shah of Perak|Raja Yussof, the then Raja Muda of Perak]] in recognition of my services appointed me Officer-in -charge of Electricity, so that I could have a salary to run my kitchen. When I organised the Huttenbacks Electrical Organisation with the help of the old members of staff and restored electricity to the town: another job of organisation was thrust on me.

The Telok Anson Government Hospital had been totally looted when the British evacuated, and the hospital beds and furniture were also missing. With information I got, I was fortunate in locating most of the looted drugs in the home of a younger brother of an Assistant Surgeon in this hospital. Sometime prior to the coming of the Japanese, the medical Officer having been panic-stricken left his post stealthily without leaving any instructions to his assistants in hospital. Some persons from whom I recovered the hospital things threatened my life, but I cared not being full of the thrill of doing a good job.}}

Throughout the war, Mr W. E. Perera was not affected by the [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities of the Japanese soldiers]] or the [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army|Communists]] but he was not immune to other factions which he thought were [[Opportunism|war opportunists]]. W. E. Perera slapped an [[Indian National Army]] health officer who rebuked him for contributing only 5 Japanese dollars for their movement. This landed W. E. Perera being branded a traitor, arrested and detained in the [[Kempeitai]] jail. However, after a few hours, he was released when his friends who worked for the Japanese protested his innocence to the Kempeitai.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook8"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, a number of people lived with the family of W. E. Perera at his residence at various times for protection against persecution by the Japanese, Communists and for economic reasons. These included Mr Neoh Ban Soon and family, Mr James Ranatunge and family, Mrs Rosie Shoemarker and family, Mrs Loveridge and six former members of an Auxiliary Armed Force. To purchase food during these years, W. E. Perera sold some of his properties.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook9"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W. E Perera saved a number of people from being executed during this period. As witnessed by his eldest son Jothika,&lt;ref name="singhalesebook5" /&gt;

{{quote|Mrs Shoemarker (a Eurasian) was saved twice by father. A Japanese officer saw her, said " Ingiris" (English) and took out his revolver to shoot her. Father pleaded with him that she was an Indian, and he changed his mind ....She was again taken for execution by the communists as she had borne a child off a Japanese. Father rescued her again ..... Dato Abdullah, The Chief Minister and later Minister of Lands and Mines was district officer in Teluk Anson when father rescued him from Chinese communists.}}

===Communist Insurgency (1946–1958)===
[[File:W.E.Perera MBE.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Mr. W. E. Perera receiving his insignia of the order of the M.B.E. from General Sir Gerald Templer, the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya.|Mr. W. E. Perera receiving his insignia of the order of the M.B.E. from Gen. Sir [[Gerald Templer]], the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya.]]

Life in Telok Anson was still difficult after the surrender of the Japanese at the end of World War II when the [[Malayan Emergency]] was declared. In the message given to his family, W. E. Perera relates the following:&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook10"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|During the interregnum lasting about a month, we were ruled by the communists and paid salaries by them. I remember one day I had to go to Ipoh in a lorry to fetch fuel oil from Ipoh for our engines. On the way back I was fortunate to meet some British paratroopers for the first time in years, and I lost no time in giving them the information that was then rife in Telok Anson that in the next two days the Chinese troops from China would be in Telok Anson and there would be a liquidation of all leading Government servants. The paratroopers told me that their orders were that the British Indian Troops that were then disembarking at [[Port Swettenham]] were destined to the north by-passing Telok Anson. Being impressed with the veracity of my information, I was happy when those men gave me the assurance that they would immediately inform their Hqrs. of what I had told them. We were thrilled to see the arrival of a contingent of British Indian troops in Telok Anson early the next afternoon.

My greatest thrill was during the early period of the British military administration, when the Communists tried to show their power by ordering the closure of schools and holding processions and rallies etc. and denouncing the British and kidnapping all wealthy people who failed to support them with finance. On my own initiative, I opened the old school at Immigrant / Anson Roads in defiance of their orders and in addition, I opened Chinese classes in the afternoon with the co-operation of Pastor Lim Hong Yong to take off the children from the streets as the Chinese Schools remained closed. This enraged the Communists who made an attempt to burn the old building but we quelled the fire in time. The British military administration was behind me and they even provided me with money to rehabilitate the old school long before the missionaries arrived on the scene.}}

When the missionaries arrived and found out what W. E. Perera, a non-Methodist teacher had done for their school, they appointed him Principal of the School.&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook10" /&gt;

As principal, he created a new high school with a laboratory for science teaching as an extension of ACS, Teluk Anson by getting his friend Mr V. Kn. Kannappa Chettiar to dispose of a five-acre block of rubber land which he owned adjoining the Raja Muda's Istana for a reasonably low price of $25,000. The school was constructed with donations from the Missionaries, various guilds and associations like the rubber and copra associations, sizeable contributions from [[Perak royal mausoleum|Raja Musa the then Raja Muda of Perak]], and the Malay Gurus Association for special class-rooms to be named after them.&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook2" /&gt;

W.E Perera was the first in Malaya to initiate a housing society for teachers of his school at Teluk Anson from 1953 to 1955. He sought loans, land, got the houses built and created the housing estate named ''Kampung Guru'' (Teacher's Village) after refusing to have it named after him. This estate was opened by Governor Mc Gillivray of Teluk Anson.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook3" /&gt;

Not one to rest on his laurels, W. E. Perera refused to accept any offers of honours or awards from the [[Yusuf Izzuddin Shah of Perak|Sultan of Perak]] for his community service during the war. He also refused the recommendation for an [[MBE]] (Member of the Order of the British Empire) award made by the then governor Sir [[Edward Gent]]. However, when General Sir [[Gerald Templer]] offered it again with the statement "the people have requested that it be bestowed upon you", W. E. Perera could not turn down the honour.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook3" /&gt;

==Retirement==
Keeping to his desire to retire in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Selangor]] so that his children could have better work and social opportunities, W. E Perera accepted the position of Principal of the Kishan Dial School, [[Petaling Jaya]] from the late Swami Satayanda. He eventually settled in Petaling Jaya, Kuala Lumpur in 1965. Here he delved into the study of Asian philosophy and was involved in the establishment of the [[Buddhist Maha Vihara, Brickfields|Brickfields Buddhist Temple]] among other social endeavours like volunteering in the schools for the underprivileged. He taught Buddhist philosophy at the local university and regularly had discussions with visiting and resident Theravada Buddhist monks like the Revs. [[K. Sri Dhammananda]], Ananda Mangala and [[Henepola Gunaratana]] whom he mentored.&lt;ref name="banteG"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Gunaratana | first = Bhante Henepola | title =Journey to Mindfulness |year = 2003|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

W. E. Perera died at the University hospital, Petaling Jaya from a massive heart attack before he was due to receive a pacemaker. Having been the first voluntary worker with the blind to have pledged his eyes earlier, his corneas were donated to the eye bank and successfully transplanted into two recipients.&lt;ref name="StaitsTimesnews"&gt;{{cite book |

The '''West Loop&amp;ndash;LaSalle Street Historic District''' is a historic district centered on [[LaSalle Street]] in the western [[Chicago Loop]]. The district encompasses Chicago's financial center, which is anchored by the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], and also includes several of its major government buildings. Development in the district began in 1873 and, with the exception of a lull during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], has continued through the present day. Most of the district's buildings are [[high-rise building|high-rises]] with at least ten stories, with the tallest being the 49-story [[One North LaSalle Building]]. Many of Chicago's prominent architectural firms designed buildings within the district, and the buildings feature styles such as [[Classical Revival architecture|Classical Revival]], [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]], [[Art Deco]], [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]], and [[International Style (architecture)|International]]. Significant buildings within the district include the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]], [[Chicago City Hall]], and several office buildings for large banks and insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Euer|first1=Danielle|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: West Loop - LaSalle Street Historic District|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/801903.pdf|publisher=Illinois Historic Preservation Agency|accessdate=February 11, 2018|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on June 1, 2013.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; A boundary increase on July 24, 2017 added two buildings at 330 S.
