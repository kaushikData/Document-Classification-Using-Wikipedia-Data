An abortion at later stages can only be obtained when two doctors certify there is a danger to the mother or fetus.

Before reforms passed in 2012, only a doctor could determine if a woman was "in distress". Abortions in the first twelve weeks were only permitted in the event of a physical or mental health threat to the mother, a serious risk that the child would be born with a serious disease or serious defects, or a pregnancy resulting from rape.

'''Agnodice''' or '''Agnodike''' ('''{{lang-grc|Ἀγνοδίκη}}''', {{IPA-grc|aŋnodíkɛː}} c. 4th century BCE) is a legendary figure credited as the first female [[midwife]] or [[physician]] in ancient Athens. Her story is told by the Roman author [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] in his ''Fabulae''.  Agnodice is not generally believed to be a historical figure, but her story has been frequently deployed as a precedent for women practising midwifery or medicine.

According to Hyginus, Agnodice studied medicine under [[Herophilus]], and worked as a physician in her home city of Athens disguised as a man, because women at the time were forbidden from practising medicine.  As her popularity with female patients grew, rival physicians accused her of seducing the women of Athens.  She was tried, and revealed her sex to the jury by lifting her tunic.  Accused of illegally practising medicine as a woman, she was defended by the women of Athens who praised her for her effective treatments. She was acquitted, and the law against female physicians in Athens was revoked.

==Life story==
Hyginus wrote that Agnodice lived in ancient Athens, where at the time women were forbidden from studying medicine.  In order to learn medicine, she disguised herself as a man, cutting her hair short, and studied under [[Herophilus]] in [[Alexandria]].  Having trained as a physician, Agnodice tried to assist women in labour, who were ashamed of, or blatantly refused to consult male practitioners.{{sfn|King|2013|p=252}}  In one case, Agnodice therefore revealed her sex and was permitted to treat the woman.  Other doctors, growing jealous of Agnodice's success, accused her of seducing her patients.  On trial before the [[Areopagus]], Agnodice once again lifted her clothes, revealing that she was a woman.  She was then charged with breaking the law which forbade women from practising medicine, but was defended by the wives of important Athenians whom she had treated.  In response to this, the law was changed to allow women to practise medicine.{{sfn|King|1986|pp=53–4}}

Hyginus describes Agnodice as an ''obstetrix''.  It is difficult to know how to translate this into English.  [[Sarah Pomeroy]] has rendered it as "obstetrician", arguing that midwives existed in Athens in Agnodice's day but that Agnodice was distinguished by her formal education in medicine.  However, Helen King notes that there was no "formal licensing system" for medics in the ancient world, and that it is anachronistic to divide ancient healers into the distinct categories of "midwife" and "obstetrician".{{sfn|King|1986|p=59}}

==Historicity==
Modern scholars generally doubt that Agnodice was a real historical figure.{{sfn|Retief|Cilliers|2006|p=178}}  Problems with accepting Agnodice as historical include questions over her date, and the implausibility of Hyginus' claim that there were no "''obstetrices''" in Athens before Agnodice, when literary and epigraphic evidence shows that midwives were known.{{sfn|King|1986|p=60}}{{sfn|King|2013|p=252}}{{sfn|King|2017}} Hyginus claims that Agnodice was taught medicine by Herophilus – generally identified with Herophilus of Chalcedon, an ancient physician known for his work on [[gynaecology]] who was credited with the discovery of the ovaries.{{sfn|King|1986|p=54}}  If this is the case, Agnodice would have lived in the late fourth or early third century BC.{{sfn|Greenhill|1870}}

The context of Agnodice’s story and similar stories could be interpreted as belonging to various different contexts, including either Greco-Roman, ancient Mediterranean, Western folk, or world ethnography. The context depends on what’s being studied, whether it be the related literatures, or other visual artistic artifacts outside the literary canon. Scholars warn against an ethnographic reading so might we not view Agnodice’s gestures as universal. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.calpoly.edu/stable/pdf/44696917.pdf?refreqid=search%3A031a5f74328b2abe40989553a9d40720}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Those who believe in the historicity of Agnodice have come to two separate conclusions explaining the lack of midwives in Athens before her.  The first theory is that there were no midwives prior to Agnodice; alternatively, it has been proposed that there were earlier midwives but they had been forbidden by law from practising.{{sfn|King|1986|p=55}}  This second theory has been elaborated over time, with Kate Hurd-Mead, in 1938, being the first to propose that women had been forbidden from practising medicine because they had been accused of performing abortions.{{sfn|King|1986|p=56}}

==Origins and manuscripts==
Agnodice's story, widely recognized as fictional, is also widely accepted as being first written in ancient Greece. Herophilus, Agnodice's teacher, is regarded as a real historical figure who lived during the third century BC. The original text has not been preserved, but passed down in Latin by an unknown Greek scribe during the second century AD. Though even this Latin version isn't preserved, we know of it through a summary concerning it, written a few hundred years later. The summary surfaced during the Renaissance when bits of the manuscript were used to support book bindings. Since then, later versions of the tale have been told and popularized. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mistakinghistories.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/agnodice-reading-the-story/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on women in medicine==
The story of Agnodice has been invoked since the sixteenth century to provide precedents for a range of gender options within the medical profession.{{sfn|King|1986|p=55}} While some later users of the story focused on the midwifery claims in the opening line, for example arguing that men were midwives before women were, or that women were midwives first, others have concentrated on what Agnodice is supposed to have learned from Herophilus, which was medicine rather than midwifery.{{sfn|King|2013|p=252}}{{sfn|King|2017}} Thus she was used both in the peak of men-midwifery in the eighteenth century and in women's struggle to enter the medical profession in the nineteenth century. [[Elizabeth Cellier]], the seventeenth century "Popish midwife", positioned herself as a modern Agnodice.{{sfn|King|1986|pp=58–9}}

However, others have taken the story of Agnodice as a negative example: Augustus Gardner, for instance, in 1851 delivered a lecture arguing that "literally, no improvement was made" in the "many centuries" where midwifery was a women's profession, comparing Agnodice to the 19th century abortionist [[Madame Restell]].{{sfn|King|1986|p=57}}

[[File:2010-07-20 Black windup alarm clock face.jpg|thumb|Traditional wind-up (keywound), mechanical, spring-driven alarm clock]]

An '''alarm clock''' ('''alarm''' for short) is a [[clock]] that is designed to alert an individual or group of individuals at specified time. The primary function of these clocks is to awaken people from their night's sleep or short naps; they are sometimes used for other reminders as well. Most use sound; some use light or vibration. Some have sensors to identify when a person is in a light stage of sleep, in order to avoid waking someone who is deeply asleep, which causes tiredness, even if the person has had adequate sleep. To stop the sound or light, a button or handle on the clock is pressed; most clocks automatically stop the alarm if left unattended long enough. A classic [[analog clock|analog]] alarm clock has an extra [[Hands of the clock|hand]] or inset dial that is used to specify the time at which to activate the alarm. Alarm clocks are also found on [[mobile phone]]s, [[watch]]es, and computers.

Many alarm clocks have [[radio receiver]]s that can be set to start playing at specified times, and are known as ''clock radios''. Some alarm clocks can set multiple alarms, a useful feature for couples who have different waking up schedules. A ''progressive alarm clock'', still new in the market, can have different alarms for different times (see [[Alarm clock#Next-generation alarms|Next-Generation Alarms]]) and even play music of your choice. Most modern televisions, mobile phones and digital watches have alarm clock functions to turn on or make sounds at a specific time.

== Types ==
=== Traditional ===
Traditional mechanical alarm clocks have one or two [[bell (instrument)|bells]] that ring by means of a [[mainspring]] that powers a gear to propel a hammer back and forth between the two bells or between the interior sides of a single bell. In some models, the back encasement of the clock itself acts as the bell. In an electric bell-style alarm clock, the bell is rung by an [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[electronic circuit|circuit]] and [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] that turns the circuit on and off repeatedly.&lt;ref name="ty"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hodkin |first1=Thomas |title=Collecting Clocks Clock Repairs &amp; Trademarks Index |date=2015 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=9781326252496 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vTG_CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=traditional+alarm+clocks+bells#v=onepage&amp;q=traditional%20alarm%20clocks%20bells&amp;f=false |accessdate=17 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital ===
[[Digital clock|Digital]] alarm clocks can make other noises. Simple [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered alarm clocks make a loud buzzing or beeping sound to wake a sleeper, while novelty alarm clocks can speak, laugh, sing, or play sounds from nature.&lt;ref name="ty"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Istambul cokol1RB.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Obelisk of Theodosius]], detail of the pedestal: [[Theodosius I]] offers laurels of victory; we can see the ''[[water organ]] of [[Ctesibius]]'', in the lower right-hand corner.]]

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] (428–348 BC) was said to possess a large [[water clock]] with an unspecified alarm signal similar to the sound of a [[water organ]]; he used it at night, possibly for signaling the beginning of his lectures at dawn ([[Athenaeus]] 4.174c).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Humphrey|Oleson|Sherwood|2003|p=522}}; {{harvnb|Lewis|2000|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenistic]] engineer and inventor [[Ctesibius]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 285–222 BC) fitted his clepsydras with dial and pointer for indicating the time, and added elaborate "alarm systems, which could be made to drop pebbles on a gong, or blow trumpets (by forcing bell-jars down into water and taking the compressed air through a beating reed) at pre-set times" ([[Vitruv]] 11.11).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landels|1979|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Late antiquity|late Roman]] statesman [[Cassiodorus]] (c. 485–585) advocated in his rulebook for monastic life the water clock as a useful alarm for the 'soldiers of [[Christ]]' (Cassiod. Inst. 30.4 f.).&lt;ref name="Dohrn-van Rossum" /&gt; The Christian rhetorician [[Procopius of Gaza|Procopius]] described in detail prior to 529 a complex public [[striking clock]] in his home town [[Gaza City|Gaza]] which featured an hourly gong and figures moving mechanically day and night.&lt;ref name="Dohrn-van Rossum"&gt;Dohrn-van Rossum, Gerhard, "Clocks", [[Brill's New Pauly]], edited by: Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, a striking clock was devised by the [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhist monk]] and inventor [[Yi Xing]] (683–727).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 473 475"&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], Volume 4, Part 2, pp. 473–5&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese engineers [[Zhang Sixun]] and [[Su Song]] integrated striking clock mechanisms in astronomical clocks in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 165"&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], Volume 4, Part 2, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; A striking clock outside of China was the water-powered clock tower near the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], which struck once every hour. It was constructed by the [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Arab engineer]] al-Kaysarani in 1154. In 1235, an early monumental water-powered alarm clock that "announced the appointed [[Salat times|hours of prayer]] and the time both by day and by night" was completed in the entrance hall of the [[Mustansiriya Madrasah]] in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Arabic Mechanical Engineering: Survey of the Historical Sources|author=[[Donald Routledge Hill]]|journal=[[Arabic Sciences and Philosophy]]|year=1991|volume=1|issue=2|pages=167–186 [180]|doi=10.1017/S0957423900001478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 14th century, some clock towers in [[Western Europe]] were also capable of chiming at a fixed time every day; the earliest of these was described by the [[Florence|Florentine]] writer [[Dante Alighieri]] in 1319.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 445"&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], Volume 4, Part 2, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous original striking clock tower still standing is possibly the one in [[St Mark's Clocktower]] in [[St Mark's Square (Venice)|St Mark's Square]], [[Venice]]. The [[St Mark's Clock]] was assembled in 1493, by the famous clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from [[Reggio Emilia]], where his father Gian Paolo Rainieri had already constructed another famous device in 1481. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell (h. 1,56&amp;nbsp;m., diameter m. 1,27), which was put on the top of the tower where it was alternatively beaten by the ''Due Mori'' (''Two [[Moors]]''), two bronze statues (h. 2,60) handling a hammer.

User-settable mechanical alarm clocks date back at least to 15th-century Europe. These early alarm clocks had a ring of holes in the clock dial and were set by placing a pin in the appropriate hole.&lt;ref&gt;p. 249, ''The Grove encyclopedia of decorative arts'', Gordon Campbell, vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-518948-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://national-clockshop-directory.com/Clock-Dictionary/m-main.htm "Monastic Alarm Clocks, Italian"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121090042/http://national-clockshop-directory.com/Clock-Dictionary/m-main.htm |date=21 November 2008 }}, entry, Clock Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first American alarm clock was created by [[Levi Hutchins]], of [[New Hampshire]] in the [[United States]], in 1787.

Alarm clocks, like almost all other consumer goods in the United States, ceased production in the spring of 1942, as the factories which made them were converted over to war work during [[World War II]], but they were one of the first consumer items to resume manufacture for civilian use, in November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Rude Awakening – The History of Alarm-Clocks |url=http://www.throughouthistory.com/?p=2974 |website=Throughout History |accessdate=15 August 2018 |date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{cite web |title=“The Clock that Caused a Near-Riot” {{!}} westclox |url=https://www.westcloxmuseum.com/single-post/2016/11/05/“The-Clock-that-Caused-a-Near-Riot” |website=westclox |accessdate=15 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, a critical shortage of alarm clocks had developed due to older clocks wearing out or breaking down. Workers were late for, or missed completely, their scheduled shifts in jobs critical to the war effort.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; In a pooling arrangement overseen by the [[Office of Price Administration]], several clock companies were allowed to start producing new clocks, some of which were continuations of pre-war designs, and some of which were new designs, thus becoming among the first "postwar" consumer goods to be made, before the war had even ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Find the time to scour antique shows for vintage alarm clocks – Antique Trader |url=http://www.antiquetrader.com/features/vintage_alarm_clocks_at_antique_shows/ |website=Antique Trader |accessdate=15 August 2018 |date=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Survey of Current Business |date=1955 |publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce|pp=21-22 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=C5RCAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA15-PA21&amp;lpg=RA15-PA21&amp;dq=clocks+postwar+consumer+goods#v=onepage&amp;q=clocks%20postwar%20consumer%20goods&amp;f=false |accessdate=15 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price of these "emergency" clocks was, however, still strictly regulated by the Office of Price Administration.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt;

The first radio alarm clock was invented by James F. Reynolds, in the 1940s and another design was also invented by Paul L. Schroth Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ha |first1=Peter |title=All-TIME 100 Gadgets – TIME |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2023689_2026093_2023751,00.html |website=Time |accessdate=15 August 2018 |date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clock radio ==

[[File:Clock radio.jpg|thumb|right|A mid 1940s alarm clock radio with AM radio stations only.]]
A clock radio is an alarm clock and radio receiver integrated in one device. The clock may turn on the radio at a designated time to wake the user, and usually includes a buzzer alarm. Typically, clock radios are placed on the bedside stand. Some models offer dual alarm for awakening at different times and "snooze", usually a large button on the top that silences the alarm and sets it to resume sounding a few minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a991126.html|title=Why does the alarm clock snooze button give you nine extra minutes, not ten?|author=[[Cecil Adams]]|publisher=[[The Straight Dope]]|date=26 November 1999|accessdate=7 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061231031126/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a991126.html| archivedate= 31 December 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some clock radios also have a "sleep" timer, which turns the radio on for a set amount of time (usually around one hour). This is useful for people who like to fall asleep while listening to the radio.

Newer clock radios are available with other music sources such as [[iPod]], [[iPhone]], and/or audio [[compact disc|CD]]. When the alarm is triggered, it can play a set radio station or the music from a selected music source to awaken the sleeper. Some models come with a dock for iPod/iPhone that also charges the device while it is docked. They can play AM/FM radio, iPod/iPhone or CD like a typical music player as well (without being triggered by the alarm function). A few popular models offer "nature sounds" like rain, forest, wind, sea, waterfall etc., in place of the buzzer.
[[File:Modern Clock Radio.JPG|thumb|right|A modern clock radio features a radio/iPod/buzzer as alarms.]]
Clock radios are powered by AC power from the wall socket. In the event of a power interruption, older electronic digital models used to reset the time to midnight (00:00) and lose alarm settings. This would cause failure to trigger the alarm even if the power is restored. Many newer clock radios feature a battery backup to maintain the time and alarm settings. Some advanced [[radio clock]]s (not to be confused with clocks with AM/FM radios) have a feature which sets the time automatically using signals from [[atomic clock]]-synced [[time signal]] [[radio station]]s such as [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]], making the clock accurate and immune to time reset due to power interruptions.

== Alarms in technology ==
=== Computer alarms===
Alarm clock software programs have been developed for [[personal computer]]s. A computer acting as an alarm clock through a website may allow a virtually unlimited number of alarm times (i.e. [[Personal information manager]]) and personalized tones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Use One of These Free Online Alarm Clocks to Wake Up on Time |url=https://www.lifewire.com/free-online-alarm-clocks-4148187 |website=www.lifewire.com |publisher=Lifewire |accessdate=16 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Mobile phone alarms ===
Many modern mobile phones feature built-in alarm clocks that do not need the phone to be switched on for the alarm to ring off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Are Alarm Clocks Still a Thing? |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vvbj3m/why-are-alarm-clocks-still-a-thing |website=Motherboard.vice.com |publisher=Motherboard |accessdate=16 August 2018 |language=en-us |date=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these mobile phones feature the ability for the user to set the alarm's [[ringtone]], and in some cases music can be [[downloaded]] to the phone and then chosen to play for waking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hot to Set the iPhone Alarm Clock to Use Songs |url=https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-set-iphone-alarm-clock-to-use-itunes-songs-2438650 |website=www.lifewire.com |publisher=Lifewire |accessdate=16 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Next-generation alarms ==
[[File:Sleeptracker blue.jpg|thumb|Sleeptracker, an alarm clock which tracks sleep phases]]

Scientific studies on sleep having shown that [[Sleep#Stages|sleep stage]] at awakening is an important factor in amplifying [[sleep inertia]]. Alarm clocks involving ''sleep stage monitoring'' appeared on the market in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSL0878172320070829 | title = Bio-alarm clocks set for perfect wake-up | accessdate = 9 June 2008 | author = Reuven Fenton | work=Reuters | date=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alarm clocks use sensing technologies such as [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] electrodes and [[accelerometers]] to wake people from sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Nam |first1=Yunyoung |last2=Kim |first2=Yeesock |last3=Lee |first3=Jinseok |title=Sleep Monitoring Based on a Tri-Axial Accelerometer and a Pressure Sensor |journal=Sensors (Basel, Switzerland) |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=750|doi=10.3390/s16050750 |pmid=27223290 |pmc=4883440 |date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wakey, wakey!

=== Alarm signals for impaired hearing ===
The deaf and hard of hearing are often unable to perceive auditory alarms when asleep. They may use specialized alarms, including alarms with flashing lights instead of or in addition to noise. Alarms which can connect to vibrating devices (small ones inserted into pillows, or larger ones placed under bedposts to shake the bed) also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alerting devices for the hearing impaired |url=https://www.healthyhearing.com/help/assistive-listening-devices/alerting-devices |website=Healthy Hearing |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vibrating alarm clocks to help deaf children wake up

== Time switches ==
{{Main|Time switch}}
Time switches can be used to turn on anything that will awaken a sleeper, and can therefore be used as alarms. Lights, bells, and radio and TV sets can easily be used.&lt;ref&gt;Walter T. Grondzik, Alison G. Kwok, Benjamin Stein ''Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings'', John Wiley and Sons, 2009 {{ISBN|0-470-19565-7}}  page 1201&lt;/ref&gt; More elaborate devices have also been used, such as machines that automatically prepare tea or coffee. A sound is produced when the drink is ready, so the sleeper awakes to find the freshly brewed drink waiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Best Coffee Makers, Cool Alarm Clock Technology |url=https://www.refinery29.com/coffee-maker-alarm-clock |accessdate=17 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of low amniotic fluid==
* Leaking or rupture of membranes
Leaking or rupture of membranes may be caused by a gush of fluid or a slow constant trickle of fluid. This is due to a tear in the membrane. [[Preterm birth|Premature]] rupture of membranes can also result in low amniotic fluid levels.
* Placental problems
Placental problems may cause low amniotic fluid. If the placenta is not providing enough blood and nutrients to the baby, then the baby may stop recycling fluid.
* Birth defects
[[Congenital disorder|Birth defects]] may occur if the fetus has problems with the development of the kidneys or urinary tract, which could cause little urine production, and it can lead to low levels of amniotic fluid.
* Maternal complications
Maternal complications may cause low amniotic fluid. Some factors such as  [[Gestational hypertension|hypertension]], diabetes, dehydration, preeclampsia, and chronic hypoxia in a woman can have an effect on amniotic fluid levels.

The '''Apple Maggot Quarantine Area''' is a permanent [[quarantine]] area established by the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The quarantine was authorized under Washington state law and the area's boundaries are periodically reset by the state's Department of Agriculture. The quarantine was declared in the early 1980s to arrest the spread of the [[apple maggot]] into a portion of [[eastern Washington]].

==History==
[[File:Rhagoletis_pomonella.jpg|thumb|right|The Apple Maggot Quarantine Area was established to control the spread of the apple maggot (''pictured'') into a protected agricultural area of [[eastern Washington]].]]
The apple maggot, which is not indigenous to the [[Pacific Northwest]], was discovered to have arrived in Washington in 1980.&lt;ref name="eh"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sheets|first1=Bill|title=Apple maggot quarantine explained|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/news/apple-maggot-quarantine-explained/|accessdate=December 4, 2017|work=[[Everett Herald]]|date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quarantine was declared thereafter and is designed to protect Washington's core apple growing regions from infestation.&lt;ref name="eh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Maggot Quarantine|url=https://agr.wa.gov/PlantsInsects/InsectPests/AppleMaggot/Quarantine.aspx|website=WSDA|publisher=Washington Department of Agriculture|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington State Department of Transportation]] installed 70 signs along highways around the state in 1985 to warn of the quarantine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kossen |first=Bill |date=February 7, 1999 |title=So many questions, so few good answers |page=4 |work=[[The Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authority for the quarantine is codified under Title 17 of the [[Revised Code of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power to adopt quarantine measures—Rules.|url=http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=17.24.041|website=[[Revised Code of Washington]]|publisher=[[State of Washington]]|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Typical body fat amounts */Changed the body fat percentage for essential fat to be something more realistic for minimum body fat percentages in modern bodybuilding.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30351">The '''body fat percentage''' ('''BFP''') of a human or other living being is the total mass of [[body fat|fat]] divided by total [[body mass]], multiplied by 100; body fat includes essential body fat and storage body fat. Essential body fat is necessary to maintain life and reproductive functions. The percentage of essential body fat for women is greater than that for men, due to the demands of [[childbearing]] and other hormonal functions. Storage body fat consists of fat accumulation in [[adipose tissue]], part of which protects [[internal organ]]s in the chest and abdomen. The minimum recommended total body fat percentage exceeds the essential fat percentage value reported above. A number of methods are available for determining body fat percentage, such as measurement with [[calipers]] or through the use of [[bioelectrical impedance analysis]].

The body fat percentage is a measure of [[physical fitness|fitness]] level, since it is the only body measurement which directly calculates a person's relative [[body composition]] without regard to height or weight. The widely used [[body mass index]] (BMI) provides a measure that allows the comparison of the adiposity of individuals of different heights and weights. While BMI largely increases as adiposity increases, due to differences in body composition, other indicators of body fat give more accurate results; for example, individuals with greater muscle mass or larger bones will have higher BMIs.  As such, BMI is a useful indicator of overall fitness for a large group of people, but a poor tool for determining the health of an individual.

==Typical body fat amounts==
[[epidemiology|Epidemiologically]], the percentage of body fat in an individual varies according to sex and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jackson AS, Stanforth PR, Gagnon J, Rankinen T, Leon AS, Rao DC, Skinner JS, Bouchard C, Wilmore JH | title = The effect of sex, age and race on estimating percentage body fat from body mass index: The Heritage Family Study | journal = International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 789–96 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12037649 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0802006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various theoretical approaches exist on the relationships between body fat percentage, health, athletic capacity, etc.  Different authorities have consequently developed different recommendations for ideal body fat percentages.

This graph from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the United States charts the average body fat percentages of Americans from samples from 1999–2004:

In males, mean percentage body fat ranged from 22.9% at age 16–19 years to 30.9% at age 60–79 years.

Essential fat is the level at which physical and physiological health would be negatively affected, and below which death is certain. Controversy exists as to whether a particular body fat percentage is better for one's health; athletic performance may also be affected. The leanest athletes typically compete at levels of about 6-13% for men or 14–20% for women.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Bodybuilders may compete at essential body fat range, in fact certified personal trainers will suggest them to keep that extremely low level of body fat only for the contest time. However it is unclear that such levels are ever actually attained since (a) the means to measure such levels are, as noted below, lacking in principle and inaccurate, and (b) 4–6% is generally considered a physiological minimum for human males.&lt;ref name="Lower limit of body fat in healthy active men."&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedl KE, Moore RJ, Martinez-Lopez LE, Vogel JA, Askew EW, Marchitelli LJ, Hoyt RW, Gordon CC | title = Lower limit of body fat in healthy active men | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 77 | issue = 2 | pages = 933–40 | date = August 1994 | pmid = 8002550 | doi = 10.1152/jappl.1994.77.2.933 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement techniques==

===Underwater weighing===
{{Main|Hydrostatic weighing}}
Irrespective of the location from which they are obtained, the fat cells in humans are composed almost entirely of pure [[triglycerides]] with an average density of about 0.9&amp;nbsp;kilograms per litre.  Most modern body composition laboratories today use the value of 1.1 kilograms per litre for the density of the “fat free mass”, a theoretical tissue composed of 72% water (density = 0.993), 21% protein (density = 1.340) and 7% mineral (density = 3.000) by weight.

With a well engineered weighing system, body density can be determined with great accuracy by completely submerging a person in water and calculating the volume of the displaced water from the weight of the displaced water.  A correction is made for the buoyancy of air in the lungs and other gases in the body spaces.  If there were no errors whatsoever in measuring body density, the uncertainty in fat estimation would be about ± 3.8% of the body weight, primarily because of normal variability in body constituents.

===Whole-body air displacement plethysmography===
{{Main|Whole-body air displacement plethysmography}}
[[File:Adult body composition through air displacement plethysmography.jpg|thumb|Body composition measurement with [[whole-body air displacement plethysmography]] (ADP) technology]]
Whole-body air displacement plethysmography (ADP) is a recognised and scientifically validated densitometric method to measure human body fat percentage.&lt;ref name="McCrory"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCrory MA, Gomez TD, Bernauer EM, Molé PA | title = Evaluation of a new air displacement plethysmograph for measuring human body composition | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 27 | issue = 12 | pages = 1686–91 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 8614326 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ADP uses the same principles as the gold-standard method of underwater weighing, but representing a densitometric method that is based on air displacement rather than on water immersion. Air-displacement plethysmography offers several advantages over established reference methods, including a quick, comfortable, automated, noninvasive, and safe measurement process, and accommodation of various subject types (e.g., children, obese, elderly, and disabled persons).&lt;ref name="Fields"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fields DA, Goran MI, McCrory MA | title = Body-composition assessment via air-displacement plethysmography in adults and children: a review | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 453–67 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11864850 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/75.3.453 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its accuracy declines at the extremes of body fat percentages, tending to slightly understate the percent body fat in overweight and obese persons (by 1.68–2.94% depending on the method of calculation), and to overstate to a much larger degree the percent body fat in very lean subjects (by an average of 6.8%, with up to a 13% overstatement of the reported body percentage of one individual — i.e. 2% body fat by DXA but 15% by ADP).&lt;ref name=LowryTomiyama&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowry DW, Tomiyama AJ | title = Air displacement plethysmography versus dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in underweight, normal-weight, and overweight/obese individuals | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = e0115086 | date = January 21, 2015 | pmid = 25607661 | pmc = 4301864 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0115086 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115086 | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1015086L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near-infrared interactance===
A beam of [[infra-red]] light is transmitted into a [[biceps]]. The light is reflected from the underlying muscle and absorbed by the fatileur . The method is safe, noninvasive, rapid and easy to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conway JM, Norris KH, Bodwell CE | title = A new approach for the estimation of body composition: infrared interactance | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 1123–30 | date = December 1984 | pmid = 6507337 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/40.6.1123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry===
{{Main|Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry}}
Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA (formerly DEXA), is a newer method for estimating body fat percentage, and determining body composition and bone mineral density.

X-rays of two different energies are used to scan the body, one of which is absorbed more strongly by fat than the other. A computer can subtract one image from the other, and the difference indicates the amount of fat relative to other tissues at each point. A sum over the entire image enables calculation of the overall body composition.

====Expansions====
There are several more complicated procedures that more accurately determine body fat percentage. Some, referred to as multicompartment models, can include DXA measurement of bone, plus independent measures of [[body water]] (using the dilution principle with isotopically labeled water) and body volume (either by water displacement or air [[plethysmography]]). Various other components may be independently measured, such as total body potassium.

[[In-vivo]] neutron activation can quantify all the elements of the body and use mathematical relations among the measured elements in the different components of the body (fat, water, protein, etc.) to develop simultaneous equations to estimate total body composition, including body fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohn SH, Vaswani AN, Yasumura S, Yuen K, Ellis KJ | title = Improved models for determination of body fat by in vivo neutron activation | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 255–9 | date = August 1984 | pmid = 6465059 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/40.2.255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body average density measurement===
Prior to the adoption of DXA, the most accurate method of estimating body fat percentage was to measure that person's average density (total mass divided by total volume) and apply a formula to convert that to body fat percentage.

Since fat tissue has a lower density than muscles and bones, it is possible
to estimate the fat content. This estimate is distorted by the fact that muscles and bones have different densities: for a person with a more-than-average amount of bone mass, the estimate will be too low. However, this method gives highly reproducible results for individual persons (± 1%), unlike the methods discussed below, which can have an uncertainty of 10%, or more. The body fat percentage is commonly calculated from one of two formulas (ρ represents density in g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;):
* Brozek formula: BF = (4.57/ρ − 4.142) × 100&lt;ref name="Brozek1963"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brozek J, Grande F, Anderson JT, Keys A | title = Densitometric analysis of body composition: revision of some quantitative assumptions | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 110 | pages = 113–40 | date = September 1963 | pmid = 14062375 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1963.tb17079.x | bibcode = 1963NYASA.110..113B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Siri formula is: BF = (4.95/ρ − 4.50) × 100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Siri WE | year=1961|chapter=Body composition from fluid spaces and density: Analysis of methods|title=Techniques for Measuring Body Composition|veditors=Brozek J, Henzchel A |pages=224–244|location=Washington|publisher=National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioelectrical impedance analysis===
{{Main|Bioelectrical impedance analysis}}

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

The bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) method is a lower-cost (from less than one to several hundred US dollars in 2006&lt;ref name="basis"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brown | first1 = Stanley P. | last2 = Miller | first2 = Wayne C. | last3 = Eason | first3 = Jane M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Exercise physiology: basis of human movement in health and disease |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=978-0-7817-7730-8 | edition = 2nd | page = 324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) but less accurate way to estimate body fat percentage. The general principle behind BIA: two or more conductors are attached to a person's body and a small electric current is sent through the body. The resistance between the conductors will provide a measure of body fat between a pair of electrodes, since the resistance to electricity varies between [[adipose]], muscular and skeletal tissue. Fat-free mass (muscle) is a good conductor as it contains a large amount of water (approximately 73%) and electrolytes, while fat is [[anhydrous]] and a poor conductor of electric current. Factors that affect the accuracy and precision of this method include instrumentation, subject factors, technician skill, and the prediction equation formulated to estimate the fat-free mass.

Each (bare) foot may be placed on an electrode, with the current sent up one leg, across the abdomen and down the other leg. (For convenience, an instrument which must be stepped on will also measure weight.) Alternatively, an electrode may be held in each hand; calculation of fat percentage uses the weight, so that must be measured with scales and entered by the user. The two methods may give different percentages, without being inconsistent, as they measure fat in different parts of the body. More sophisticated instruments for domestic use are available with electrodes for both feet and hands.

There is little scope for technician error as such, but factors such as eating, drinking and exercising must be controlled&lt;ref name=basis/&gt; since hydration level is an important source of error in determining the flow of the electric current to estimate body fat. The instructions for use of instruments typically recommended not making measurements soon after drinking or eating or exercising, or when dehydrated. Instruments require details such as sex and age to be entered, and use formulae taking these into account; for example, men and women store fat differently around the abdomen and thigh region.

Different BIA analysers may vary. Population-specific equations are available for some instruments, which are only reliable for specific ethnic groups, populations, and conditions. Population-specific equations may not be appropriate for individuals outside of specific groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dehghan M, Merchant AT | title = Is bioelectrical impedance accurate for use in large epidemiological studies? | journal = Nutrition Journal | volume = 7 | pages = 26 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18778488 | pmc = 2543039 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2891-7-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropometric methods===
There exist various anthropometric methods for estimating body fat. The term ''anthropometric'' refers to measurements made of various parameters of the human body, such as circumferences of various body parts or thicknesses of skinfolds. Most of these methods are based on a statistical model. Some measurements are selected, and are applied to a population sample. For each individual in the sample, the method's measurements are recorded, and that individual's body density is also recorded, being determined by, for instance, under-water weighing, in combination with a multi-compartment body density model. From this data, a formula relating the body measurements to density is developed.

Because most anthropometric formulas such as the Durnin-Womersley skinfold method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Durnin JV, Womersley J | title = Body fat assessed from total body density and its estimation from skinfold thickness: measurements on 481 men and women aged from 16 to 72 years | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–97 | date = July 1974 | pmid = 4843734 | doi = 10.1079/BJN19740060 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Jackson-Pollock skinfold method, and the US Navy circumference method, actually estimate body density, not body fat percentage, the body fat percentage is obtained by applying a second formula, such as the Siri or Brozek described in the above section on density. Consequently, the body fat percentage calculated from [[skin fold]]s or other anthropometric methods carries the cumulative error from the application of two separate statistical models.

These methods are therefore inferior to a direct measurement of body density and the application of just one formula to estimate body fat percentage. One way to regard these methods is that they trade accuracy for convenience, since it is much more convenient to take a few body measurements than to submerge individuals in water.

The chief problem with all statistically derived formulas is that in order to be widely applicable, they must be based on a broad sample of individuals. Yet, that breadth makes them inherently inaccurate. The ideal statistical estimation method for an individual is based on a sample of similar individuals. For instance, a skinfold based body density formula developed from a sample of male collegiate rowers is likely to be much more accurate for estimating the body density of a male collegiate rower than a method developed using a sample of the general population, because the sample is narrowed down by age, sex, physical fitness level, type of sport, and lifestyle factors. On the other hand, such a formula is unsuitable for general use.

====Skinfold methods====
The skinfold estimation methods are based on a ''skinfold test'', also known as a ''pinch test'', whereby a [[Pinch (action)|pinch]] of skin is precisely measured by [[caliper]]s, also known as a '''Plicometer''',&lt;ref name="zonatto"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zonatto HA, Ribas MR, Simm EB, Oliveira AG, Bassan JC |title=Correction equations to estimate body fat with plicometer WCS dual hand |journal=Research on Biomedical Engineering |date=Oct-Dec 2017 |volume=33 |issue=4 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S2446-47402017000400285 |access-date=14 July 2018}} ''In this paper the terms "skinfold caliper" and "plicometer" are used interchangeable, as in the description of Table 2''&lt;/ref&gt; at several standardized points on the body to determine the [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] fat layer thickness.&lt;ref name="Sarria1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sarría A, García-Llop LA, Moreno LA, Fleta J, Morellón MP, Bueno M | title = Skinfold thickness measurements are better predictors of body fat percentage than body mass index in male Spanish children and adolescents | journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 52 | issue = 8 | pages = 573–6 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9725657 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1600606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/89293575.html?dids=89293575:89293575&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+02%2C+2001&amp;author=Dr.+Reuven+Bruner&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;desc=A-Z+of+health%2C+fitness+and+nutrition+%28Part+one%29&amp;pqatl=google |title=A-Z of health, fitness and nutrition |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] | first = Reuven | last = Bruner | name-list-format = vanc |date=2 November 2001 |access-date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measurements are converted to an estimated body fat percentage by an equation. Some formulas require as few as three measurements, others as many as seven. The accuracy of these estimates is more dependent on a person's unique body fat distribution than on the number of sites measured. As well, it is of utmost importance to test in a precise location with a fixed pressure. Although it may not give an accurate reading of real body fat percentage, it is a reliable measure of body composition change over a period of time, provided the test is carried out by the same person with the same technique.

Skinfold-based body fat estimation is sensitive to the type of caliper used, and technique. This method also only measures one type of fat: subcutaneous adipose tissue (fat under the skin). Two individuals might have nearly identical measurements at all of the skin fold sites, yet differ greatly in their body fat levels due to differences in other body fat deposits such as visceral adipose tissue: fat in the abdominal cavity. Some models partially address this problem by including age as a variable in the statistics and the resulting formula. Older individuals are found to have a lower body density for the same skinfold [[measurement]]s, which is assumed to signify a higher body fat percentage. However, older, highly athletic individuals might not fit this assumption, causing the formulas to underestimate their body density.

====Ultrasound====
Ultrasound is used extensively to measure tissue structure and has proven to be an accurate technique to measure subcutaneous fat thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Heymsfield | first = Steven | name-list-format = vanc |title=Human Body Composition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_WoPgY4KAxgC&amp;pg=PA425|year=2005|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-4655-8|pages=425–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A-mode and B-mode ultrasound systems are now used and both rely on using tabulated values of tissue sound speed and automated signal analysis to determine fat thickness.  By making thickness measurements at multiple sites on the body you can calculate the estimated body fat percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pineau JC, Guihard-Costa AM, Bocquet M | title = Validation of ultrasound techniques applied to body fat measurement. A comparison between ultrasound techniques, air displacement plethysmography and bioelectrical impedance vs. dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry | journal = Annals of Nutrition &amp; Metabolism | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 421–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18025814 | doi = 10.1159/000111161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Utter AC, Hager ME | title = Evaluation of ultrasound in assessing body composition of high school wrestlers | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 943–9 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18408602 | doi = 10.1249/MSS.0b013e318163f29e }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ultrasound techniques can also be used to directly measure muscle thickness and quantify intramuscular fat. Ultrasound equipment is expensive, and not cost-effective solely for body fat measurement, but where equipment is available, as in hospitals, the extra cost for the capability to measure body fat is minimal.&lt;ref name=basis/&gt;

====Height and circumference methods====
{{Main|Body mass index}}
There also exist formulas for estimating body fat percentage from an individual's weight and girth measurements. For example, the U.S. Navy circumference method compares abdomen or waist and hips measurements to neck measurement and height and other sites claim to estimate one's body fat percentage by a conversion from the [[body mass index]]. In the U.S. Navy the method is known as the "rope and choke." There is limited information, however, on the validity of the "rope and choke" method because of its universal acceptance as inaccurate and easily falsified.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The [[U.S. Army]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps]] also rely on the height and circumference method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/bodyComposition/docs/AR600_9_28-June-2013.pdf|title=Army Regulation 600–9: The Army Body Composition Program |date=28 June 2013|publisher=Department of the Army|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=26–31|chapter=B–3|quote=Description of circumference sites and their anatomical landmarks and technique|ref=PIN 003345–000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For males, they measure the neck and waist just above the navel. Females are measured around the hips, waist, and neck. These measurements are then looked up in published tables, with the individual's height as an additional parameter. This method is used because it is a cheap and convenient way to implement a body fat test throughout an entire service.

Methods using circumference have little acceptance outside the Department of Defense due to their negative reputation in comparison to other methods. The method's accuracy becomes an issue when comparing people with different body compositions, those with larger necks artificially generate lower body fat percentage calculations than those with smaller necks.

====From BMI====
Body fat can be estimated from [[body mass index]] (BMI), a person's mass in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters; if weight is measured in pounds and height in inches, the result can be converted to BMI by multiplying by 703.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/lapband/candidate/criteria.htm|title=Gastric Banding Surgery |publisher=UC San Diego }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of proposed formulae that relate body fat to BMI. These formulae are based on work by researchers published in [[peer-review]]ed journals, but their correlation with body fat are only estimates; body fat cannot be deduced accurately from BMI.

Body fat may be estimated from the body mass index by formulae derived by Deurenberg and co-workers. When making calculations, the relationship between densitometrically determined body fat percentage (BF%) and BMI must take age and sex into account. Internal and external cross-validation of the prediction formulas showed that they gave valid estimates of body fat in males and females at all ages. In obese subjects, however, the prediction formulas slightly overestimated the BF%. The prediction error is comparable to the prediction error obtained with other methods of estimating BF%, such as skinfold thickness measurements and bioelectrical impedance. The formula for children is different; the relationship between BMI and BF% in children was found to differ from that in adults due to the height-related increase in BMI in children aged 15 years and younger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halls.md/bmi/fat.htm BMI to body fat percentage formula], {{cite journal | vauthors = Deurenberg P, Weststrate JA, Seidell JC | title = Body mass index as a measure of body fatness: age- and sex-specific prediction formulas | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–14 | date = March 1991 | pmid = 2043597 | doi = 10.1079/BJN19910073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{Child body fat percentage} = 1.51 \times \text{BMI} - 0.70 \times \text{age} - 3.6 \times \text{sex} + 1.4&lt;/math&gt;
:
:&lt;math&gt; \text{Adult body fat percentage} = 1.20 \times \text{BMI} + 0.23 \times \text{age} - 10.8 \times \text{sex} - 5.4&lt;/math&gt;

:where sex is 0 for females and 1 for males.

However – contrary to the aforementioned internal and external cross-validation –, these formulae definitely proved unusable at least for adults and are presented here illustratively only.

Still, the following formula designed for adults proved to be much more accurate at least for adults:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livestrong.com/article/173592-how-to-convert-bmi-to-body-fat-percentage/ How to Convert BMI to Body Fat Percentage]. By Jessica Bruso with reference to a study published in the International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders in 2002. July 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(Adult) body fat percentage} = 1.39 \times \text{BMI} + 0.16 \times \text{age} - 10.34 \times \text{gender} - 9&lt;/math&gt;

:where, again,  gender (sex) is 0 if female and 1 if male to account for the lower body fat percentage of men.

Other indices may be used; the [[body adiposity index]] was said by its developers to give a direct estimate of body fat percentage, but statistical studies found this not to be so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barreira TV, Harrington DM, Staiano AE, Heymsfield SB, Katzmarzyk PT | title = Body adiposity index, body mass index, and body fat in white and black adults | journal = Jama | volume = 306 | issue = 8 | pages = 828–30 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21862743 | pmc = 3951848 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2011.1189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cryptotia''' is the condition where an [[ear]] appears to have its upper portion buried underneath the side of the head.  The condition also involves underdeveloped scapha and [[Antihelix|antihelical crura]].  Cryptotia is also known as buried ear or hidden ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.drdavidbrayjr.com/face/otoplasty-ear-shaping/cryptotia/ | author = Bray, Jr., M.D., David | title = Cryptotia | accessdate = December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Treatment==

Cryptotia is often treated through surgery which involves releasing the ear from its buried position, reshaping the [[cartilage]] and using local tissue to resurface the released cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.med.unc.edu/plastic/ptinfo/pediatric-plastic-and-craniofacial-surgery/cryptotia | author = University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, School of Medicine | title = Cryptotia | accessdate = December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lowercase|title=dKH}}

'''Degrees of carbonate hardness''' ('''dKH''' or '''°KH'''; the K is from the German ''Karbonathärte'') is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[Hard water|water hardness]], specifically for temporary or [[carbonate hardness]]. Carbonate hardness is a measure of the concentration of carbonates such as [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[magnesium carbonate]] (MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) per volume of water. Specifically, 1 dKH is defined as 17.86 milligrams (mg) of calcium carbonate per litre of water, i.e. 17.86 ppm. Since a mole of calcium carbonate weighs 100.09 grams, 1 dKH is equivalent to 0.17832 [[mmol]] per litre.  

dKH are the same as °fH, degrees of French hardness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">'''Industrial exhaust ducts''' are pipe systems that connect hoods to industrial chimneys through other components of exhaust systems like fans, collectors, etc. Ducts are low-pressure pneumatic conveyors to convey dust, particles, shavings, fumes, or chemical hazardous components from air in the vicinity to a shop floor or any other specific locations like tanks, sanding machines, or laboratory hoods. Ducts can be fabricated from a variety of materials including carbon steel, stainless steel, PVC, and fiberglass. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/blog/2011/07/25/hinged-universal-expansion-joint-and-duct-work-assembly-110618/ Duct Work Assembly] U.S. Bellows, (retrieved May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; They can be fabricated through rolling (preferable for ducts of 12" or more in diameter) or extruded (for ducts up to 18").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kchservices.com/products/corrosion-resistant-ducting/duct-fittings KCH Engineered Systems] &lt;/ref&gt;

[[HVAC]] systems do not include this category of industrial application, namely exhaust systems.  A distinction from HVAC system ducts is that the fluid (air) conveyed through the duct system may not be homogeneous. An industrial exhaust duct system is primarily a pneumatic conveying system and is basically governed by laws of flow of fluids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tc52.ashraetcs.org/] ASHRAE Technical Committee 5.2 - Duct Design&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fluid flow ==
The conveying fluid that flows through the duct system is air. Air transports materials from the hood to a destination. It is also instrumental in capturing the material into the flow system. Air is a compressible fluid, but for engineering calculations, air is considered as incompressible as a simplification, without any significant errors.

== Design ==
Process design of exhaust system will include
* Identification of contaminants, their density and size
* Deciding of air flow
* Sizing of the ductwork
* Calculation of resistance
* Finalizing the capacity of blower, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/ductdesignfundamentals/] Industrial Duct System Design Fundamentals&lt;/ref&gt;
The goal is to keep contaminants out using minimum airflow. It is estimated that increase in an inch wg{{clarify|date=July 2014}} of static pressure can add a few thousands of dollars to the operation cost per annum.

'''Ernst Ludwig Wynder, M.D.''' (April 30, 1922 – July 14, 1999) was an American [[epidemiology]] and [[public health]] researcher who studied the health effects of smoking tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times Biographical Service. A compilation of current biographical information of general interest. Volume 30, Numbers 1-12. Ann Arbor, MI: Bell &amp; Howell Information &amp; Learning Co., 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[1950 Wynder and Graham Study|1950 coauthored publication]] of "Tobacco Smoking as a Possible Etiologic Factor in Bronchiogenic Carcinoma: A Study of 684 Proved Cases" appeared in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]]. It was one of the first major scientific publications identifying smoking as a contributory cause of lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=WYNDER EL, GRAHAM EA |title=Tobacco smoking as a possible etiologic factor in bronchiogenic carcinoma; a study of 684 proved cases |journal=J Am Med Assoc |volume=143 |issue=4 |pages=329–36 |date=May 1950 |pmid=15415260 |doi= 10.1001/jama.1950.02910390001001|url=|pmc=2623809 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Wynder was born in [[Herford]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]] in 1922 to Jewish parents (a cousin of [[Robert Weinberg]]).&lt;ref&gt;Angier, N. 1988. ''Natural obsessions: striving to unlock the deepest secrets of the cancer cell''. Houghton Mifflin, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 his family escaped Nazi rule and fled to the United States, where Wynder enrolled at [[New York University]]. During [[World War II]], he attained citizenship and joined the U.S. Army, where, as a German-speaker, he was assigned to a psychological warfare unit to monitor German newscasts. After the war, he attended medical school at [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. In 1950, he received both a Bachelor of Science and a medical degree. Aside from his credentials as a physician, Wynder was a researcher, educator, and activist. He devoted his career to the study and prevention of cancer and chronic disease, including the publication of hundreds of scientific papers. Through the 1950s and 1960s, he worked at [[Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research]]. In 1969, he founded the [[Institute for Cancer Prevention|American Health Foundation]]. In 1972, he founded the academic journal ''[[Preventive Medicine (journal)|Preventive Medicine]]'' and served as the founding editor. Wynder died from thyroid cancer on July 14, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/16/us/ernst-wynder-77-a-cancer-researcher-dies.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Allan M. 2007. ''The Cigarette Century''. New York: Basic Books, pages 133-134.&lt;br /&gt;Also see {{cite journal | year = | title = Wydner's obituary | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4843bx.htm | journal = [[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]] | volume = 48 | issue = 43| page = 987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarship ==

=== Smoking and Lung Cancer Studies ===
Wynder began collaborating with his coauthor on the article, [[Evarts Ambrose Graham]], as a medical student at Washington University in St. Louis in 1947. The previous summer he had conducted epidemiological studies of smoking behavior among 146 lung cancer patients in New York City. The project was funded by the [[American Cancer Society]]. Now, with Graham, Wynder collected extensive data on 604 patients with lung cancer at hospitals across the United States. Departing from a tradition of using anecdotal evidence (e.g., clinical interviews) to develop explanations of disease causation, Wynder and Graham applied rudimentary statistical methods to their study. They divided patients into crude categories of "moderate" or "heavy" smokers, based on retrospective interviews of each patient's smoking behavior over a twenty-year period. They also measured and controlled for important confounding factors (e.g., age, types of tobacco use, inhalation level). Most importantly, with regard to an ability to demonstrate causation, Wynder and Graham also studied a control group of cancer-free individuals in hospitals. They systematically compared the lung cancer patients to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Allan M. 2007. The Cigarette Century. New York: Basic Books, pages 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 27, 1950 the Journal of the [[American Medical Association]] published the [[1950 Wynder and Graham Study|resulting scientific report]]. Incidence among men and women matched patterns of smoking behavior in men and women; 4) "the enormous increase in the sale of cigarettes in this country approximately parallels the increase in [lung cancer]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wynder EL, Graham E | year = 1950 | title = Tobacco smoking as a possible etiologic factor in bronchiogenic carcinoma: a study of 684 proven cases | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 143 | issue = 4| pages = 329–36 | doi=10.1001/jama.1950.02910390001001 | pmid=15415260| pmc=2623809}} Also see Brandt, Allan M. 2007. The Cigarette Century. New York: Basic Books, pages 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt; As further scientific evidence of smoking's role in causing lung cancer began to mount in the United States and Great Britain, Wynder and Graham investigated the [[biological plausibility]] of the association between smoking and lung disease. In 1950, they initiated a study of the impact of cigarette tar condensate from tobacco smoke on mice skin.&lt;ref&gt;http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/13/12/855&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of exposure to tar, 44 percent of the mice developed cancers. Wynder also discovered specific carcinogens in tar (e.g., [[benzopyrenes]], [[arsenic]]), but was unable to identify the contributions of these chemicals to cancer.

Wynder's studies of tobacco smoke were timely and important. Whereas laboratory studies of tobacco tar had been conducted elsewhere, Wynder's findings supported the growing epidemiological data. "The production of tumors in lab animals offered a powerful indicator that something in cigarette smoke could account for the epidemiological findings," writes Allan M. Brandt, a historian of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Allan M. 2007. The Cigarette Century. New York: Basic Books, page 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Research ===
Wynder published nearly 800 papers during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hoffmann I |title=The full bibliography of Ernst Ludwig Wynder |journal=Prev Med |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=274–90 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17007915 |doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2006.08.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wynder's work appeared in 139 periodicals and one book. More than half of his articles were published in ten prestigious mainline journals, such as ''Cancer'', the flagship journal of the [[American Cancer Society]]. The dominant themes were lung and breast cancer, but there were also in-depth studies of the epidemiology of cancer of the bladder, larynx, colon and rectum, stomach, ovary, prostate, pancreas, and kidney, as well as numerous experimental studies. Many of these papers were the first or most comprehensive studies ever published, especially the massive 1960 coauthored study of the epidemiology of breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wynder EL, Bross IJ, Hirayama T | year = 1960 | title = A study of the epidemiology of cancer of the breast | url = | journal = Cancer | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 559–601 | doi=10.1002/1097-0142(196005/06)13:3&lt;559::aid-cncr2820130322&gt;3.0.co;2-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estrogen''', or '''oestrogen''', is the primary [[female]] [[sex steroid|sex hormone]]. It is responsible for the development and regulation of the female [[reproductive system]] and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s. There are three major [[endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] estrogens in females that have '''estrogenic''' hormonal activity: [[estrone]], [[estradiol]], and [[estriol]]. The [[estrane]] [[steroid]] [[estradiol]] is the most potent and prevalent of these.

Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates&lt;ref name="pmid7083198"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryan KJ | title = Biochemistry of aromatase: significance to female reproductive physiology | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 42 | issue = 8 Suppl | pages = 3342s–3344s | date = August 1982 | pmid = 7083198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some insects.&lt;ref name="Mechoulam_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mechoulam R, Brueggemeier RW, Denlinger DL | title = Estrogens in insects | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |date=September 2005 | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 942–944|doi=10.1007/BF01946450 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/tr77034552r222m1/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence in both vertebrates and insects suggests that estrogenic sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history. The three major naturally occurring forms of estrogen in females are [[estrone]] (E1), [[estradiol]] (E2), and [[estriol]] (E3). Another type of estrogen called [[estetrol]] (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. Quantitatively, estrogens circulate at lower levels than androgens in both men and women.&lt;ref name="Burger2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burger HG | title = Androgen production in women | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 77 Suppl 4 | issue =  | pages = S3–5 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 12007895 | doi = 10.1016/S0015-0282(02)02985-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While estrogen levels are significantly lower in males compared to females, estrogens nevertheless also have important physiological roles in males.&lt;ref name="pmid11403894"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lombardi G, Zarrilli S, Colao A, Paesano L, Di Somma C, Rossi F, De Rosa M | title = Estrogens and health in males | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 178 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 51–5 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11403894 | doi = 10.1016/S0303-7207(01)00420-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all [[steroid hormone]]s, estrogens readily [[diffusion|diffuse]] across the [[cell membrane]]. Once inside the cell, they bind to and activate [[estrogen receptor]]s (ERs) which in turn [[regulation of gene expression|modulate]] the [[gene expression|expression]] of many [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn978-1-85996-252-7"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Whitehead SA, Nussey S | editor = | others = | title = Endocrinology: an integrated approach | edition = | publisher = BIOS: Taylor &amp; Francis | location = Oxford | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-1-85996-252-7 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=endocrin.TOC&amp;depth=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, estrogens bind to and activate rapid-signaling [[membrane estrogen receptor]]s (mERs),&lt;ref name="pmid23756388"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soltysik K, Czekaj P | title = Membrane estrogen receptors – is it an alternative way of estrogen action? | journal = Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–42 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23756388 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22538318"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Micevych PE, Kelly MJ | title = Membrane estrogen receptor regulation of hypothalamic function | journal = Neuroendocrinology | volume = 96 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–10 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22538318 | pmc = 3496782 | doi = 10.1159/000338400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[GPER]] (GPR30).&lt;ref name="pmid17222505"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prossnitz ER, Arterburn JB, Sklar LA | title = GPR30: A G protein-coupled receptor for estrogen | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 265–266 | pages = 138–42 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17222505 | pmc = 1847610 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2006.12.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their role as natural hormones, estrogens are used as [[medication]]s, for instance in [[menopausal hormone therapy]] and [[hormonal birth control]]; for information on estrogens as medications, see the [[estrogen (medication)]] article.

The four major naturally occurring estrogens in women are [[estrone]] (E1), [[estradiol]] (E2), [[estriol]] (E3), and [[estetrol]] (E4). Estradiol is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years both in terms of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity. During [[menopause]], estrone is the predominant circulating estrogen and during pregnancy estriol is the predominant circulating estrogen in terms of serum levels. Given by [[subcutaneous injection]] in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol.&lt;ref name="Labhart2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Labhart|title=Clinical Endocrinology: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAgJCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA548|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-96158-8|pages=548–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, estradiol is the most important estrogen in non-pregnant females who are between the [[menarche]] and menopause stages of life. However, during [[pregnancy]] this role shifts to estriol, and in postmenopausal women estrone becomes the primary form of estrogen in the body. Another type of estrogen called [[estetrol]] (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. All of the different forms of estrogen are synthesized from [[androgen]]s, specifically [[testosterone]] and [[androstenedione]], by the [[enzyme]] [[aromatase]].

Minor endogenous estrogens, the biosyntheses of which do not involve [[aromatase]], include [[27-hydroxycholesterol]], [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), [[7-oxo-DHEA]], [[7α-hydroxy-DHEA]], [[16α-hydroxy-DHEA]], [[7β-hydroxyepiandrosterone]], [[androstenedione]] (A4), [[androstenediol]] (A5), [[3α-androstanediol]], and [[3β-androstanediol]].&lt;ref name="pmid23313336"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker ME | title = What are the physiological estrogens? | journal = Steroids | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 337–40 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23313336 | doi = 10.1016/j.steroids.2012.12.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23123738"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller KK, Al-Rayyan N, Ivanova MM, Mattingly KA, Ripp SL, Klinge CM, Prough RA | title = DHEA metabolites activate estrogen receptors alpha and beta | journal = Steroids | volume = 78 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–25 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23123738 | pmc = 3529809 | doi = 10.1016/j.steroids.2012.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some estrogen metabolites, such as the [[catechol estrogen]]s [[2-hydroxyestradiol]], [[2-hydroxyestrone]], [[4-hydroxyestradiol]], and [[4-hydroxyestrone]], as well as [[16α-hydroxyestrone]], are also estrogens with varying degrees of activity.&lt;ref name="pmid10865186"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhavnani BR, Nisker JA, Martin J, Aletebi F, Watson L, Milne JK | title = Comparison of pharmacokinetics of a conjugated equine estrogen preparation (premarin) and a synthetic mixture of estrogens (C.E.S.) in postmenopausal women | journal = Journal of the Society for Gynecologic Investigation | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–83 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10865186 | doi = 10.1016/s1071-5576(00)00049-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological importance of these minor estrogens is not entirely clear.

The actions of estrogen are mediated by the [[estrogen receptor]] (ER), a dimeric nuclear protein that binds to DNA and controls gene expression. Like other steroid hormones, estrogen enters passively into the cell where it binds to and activates the estrogen receptor. The estrogen:ER complex binds to specific DNA sequences called a [[hormone response element]] to activate the transcription of target genes (in a study using an estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell line as model, 89 such genes were identified).&lt;ref name="pmid15345050"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin CY, Ström A, Vega VB, Kong SL, Yeo AL, Thomsen JS, Chan WC, Doray B, Bangarusamy DK, Ramasamy A, Vergara LA, Tang S, Chong A, Bajic VB, Miller LD, Gustafsson JA, Liu ET | title = Discovery of estrogen receptor alpha target genes and response elements in breast tumor cells | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = R66 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15345050 | pmc = 522873 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2004-5-9-r66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since estrogen enters all cells, its actions are dependent on the presence of the ER in the cell.

While estrogens are present in both [[man|men]] and [[woman|women]], they are usually present at significantly higher levels in women of reproductive age. They promote the development of female [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, such as [[breasts]], and are also involved in the thickening of the [[endometrium]] and other aspects of regulating the menstrual cycle.

===Female pubertal development===
Estrogens are responsible for the development of female [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s during [[puberty]], including [[breast development]], widening of the [[hip]]s, and female [[fat distribution]]. Conversely, [[androgen]]s are responsible for [[pubic hair|pubic]] and [[body hair]] [[hair growth|growth]], as well as [[acne]] and [[body odor|axillary odor]].

====Breast development====
{{See also|Breast development#Biochemistry}}
Estrogen, in conjunction with [[growth hormone]] (GH) and its secretory product [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1), is critical in mediating breast development during [[puberty]], as well as breast maturation during [[pregnancy]] in preparation of [[lactation]] and [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name="Malley2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brisken C, O'Malley B | title = Hormone action in the mammary gland | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = a003178 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20739412 | pmc = 2982168 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a003178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9516076"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleinberg DL | title = Role of IGF-I in normal mammary development | journal = Breast Cancer Research and Treatment | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 201–8 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9516076 | doi = 10.1023/a:1005998832636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrogen is primarily and directly responsible for inducing the ductal component of breast development,&lt;ref name="Johnson2003"&gt;{{cite book | first = Leonard R. | last = Johnson | title = Essential Medical Physiology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j9e-tkdHeUoC&amp;pg=PA770 | year = 2003 | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-387584-6 | pages = 770 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NormanHenry2014"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Anthony W. | last1 = Norman | first2 = Helen L. | last2 = Henry | name-list-format = vanc | title = Hormones | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_renonjXq68C&amp;pg=PA311 | date = 30 July 2014|publisher=Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-08-091906-5 | pages = 311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoadDunstall2011"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Jane | last1 = Coad | first2 = Melvyn | last2 = Dunstall | name-list-format = vanc | title = Anatomy and Physiology for Midwives, with Pageburst online access,3: Anatomy and Physiology for Midwives | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OmSKoYD-iW0C&amp;pg=PA413 | year = 2011 | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn = 978-0-7020-3489-3 | pages = 413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for causing [[fat deposition]] and [[connective tissue]] growth.&lt;ref name="Johnson2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NormanHenry2014" /&gt; It is also indirectly involved in the lobuloalveolar component, by increasing [[progesterone receptor]] expression in the breasts&lt;ref name="Johnson2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoadDunstall2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HaslamOsuch2006"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Sandra Z. | last1 = Haslam | first2 = Janet R. | last2 = Osuch | name-list-format = vanc | title = Hormones and Breast Cancer in Post-Menopausal Women | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wGaKtDw50K0C&amp;pg=PA69 | date = 1 January 2006 | publisher=IOS Press | isbn = 978-1-58603-653-9 | pages = 69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by inducing the secretion of [[prolactin]].&lt;ref name="SilbernaglDespopoulos2011"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Stefan | last1 = Silbernagl | first2 = Agamemnon | last2 = Despopoulos | name-list-format = vanc | title = Color Atlas of Physiology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WyuCGhv4kvwC&amp;pg=PA305 | date = 1 January 2011 | publisher = Thieme | isbn = 978-3-13-149521-1 | pages = 305– }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fadem2007"&gt;{{cite book| first = Barbara | last = Fadem | title = High-yield Comprehensive USMLE Step 1 Review | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d-MxROzDPgcC&amp;pg=PA445 | year = 2007 | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | isbn = 978-0-7817-7427-7 | pages = 445– | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowed for by estrogen, [[progesterone]] and prolactin work together to complete lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="NormanHenry2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackburn2014"&gt;{{cite book | first = Susan | last = Blackburn | name-list-format = vanc | title = Maternal, Fetal, &amp; Neonatal Physiology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RNLsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146 | date = 14 April 2014 | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn = 978-0-323-29296-2 | pages = 146– }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female reproductive system===
Estrogens are responsible for maturation and maintenance of the [[vagina]] and [[uterus]], and are also involved in [[ovary|ovarian]] function, such as maturation of [[ovarian follicle]]s. In addition, estrogens play an important role in regulation of [[gonadotropin]] [[secretion]]. For these reasons, estrogens are required for female [[fertility]].

===Brain and behavior===

====Sex drive====
{{See also|Sexual motivation and hormones}}

Estrogens are involved in [[libido]] (sex drive) in both women and men.

====Cognition====
[[Verbal memory]] scores are frequently used as one measure of higher level [[cognition]]. These scores vary in direct proportion to estrogen levels throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. Furthermore, estrogens when administered shortly after natural or surgical menopause prevents decreases in verbal memory. In contrast, estrogens have little effect on verbal memory if first administered years after menopause.&lt;ref name="pmid22004260"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sherwin BB | title = Estrogen and cognitive functioning in women: lessons we have learned | journal = Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 123–7 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22004260 | pmc = 4838456 | doi = 10.1037/a0025539 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrogens also have positive influences on other measures of cognitive function.&lt;ref name="pmid26109339"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hara Y, Waters EM, McEwen BS, Morrison JH | title = Estrogen Effects on Cognitive and Synaptic Health Over the Lifecourse | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 785–807 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26109339 | pmc = 4491541 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00036.2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the effect of estrogens on cognition is not uniformly favorable and is dependent on the timing of the dose and the type of cognitive skill being measured.&lt;ref name="pmid26149525"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Korol DL, Pisani SL | title = Estrogens and cognition: Friends or foes?: An evaluation of the opposing effects of estrogens on learning and memory | journal = Hormones and Behavior | volume = 74 | issue =  | pages = 105–15 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26149525 | pmc = 4573330 | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2015.06.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mental health====
Estrogen is considered to play a significant role in women's [[mental health]]. Sudden estrogen withdrawal, fluctuating estrogen, and [[Period of time|periods]] of sustained low estrogen levels correlate with significant mood lowering.

Compulsions in male lab mice, such as those in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), may be caused by low estrogen levels. When estrogen levels were raised through the increased activity of the enzyme [[aromatase]] in male lab mice, OCD rituals were dramatically decreased. [[Hypothalamus|Hypothalamic]] protein levels in the gene [[catechol-O-methyl transferase|COMT]] are enhanced by increasing estrogen levels which are believed to return mice that displayed OCD rituals to normal activity. Aromatase deficiency is ultimately suspected which is involved in the synthesis of estrogen in humans and has therapeutic implications in humans having obsessive-compulsive disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid16566897"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill RA, McInnes KJ, Gong EC, Jones ME, Simpson ER, Boon WC | title = Estrogen deficient male mice develop compulsive behavior | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 359–66 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 16566897 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.01.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local application of estrogen in the rat hippocampus has been shown to inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin. Contrarily, local application of estrogen has been shown to block the ability of [[fluvoxamine]] to slow serotonin clearance, suggesting that the same pathways which are involved in SSRI efficacy may also be affected by components of local estrogen signaling pathways.&lt;ref name="pmid22225849"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benmansour S, Weaver RS, Barton AK, Adeniji OS, Frazer A | title = Comparison of the effects of estradiol and progesterone on serotonergic function | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 71 | issue = 7 | pages = 633–41 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22225849 | pmc = 3307822 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.11.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also found that fathers had lower levels of cortisol and testosterone but higher levels of estrogen (estradiol) compared to non-fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berg SJ, Wynne-Edwards KE | title = Changes in testosterone, cortisol, and estradiol levels in men becoming fathers | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 76 | issue = 6 | pages = 582–92 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11393496 | doi = 10.4065/76.6.582 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11944938_Changes_in_Testosterone_Cortisol_and_Estradiol_Levels_in_Men_Becoming_Fathers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Binge eating====
Estrogen may play a role in suppressing [[binge eating]]. Hormone replacement therapy using estrogen may be a possible treatment for binge eating behaviors in females. Estrogen replacement has been shown to suppress binge eating behaviors in female mice.&lt;ref name=Cao&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao X, Xu P, Oyola MG, Xia Y, Yan X, Saito K, Zou F, Wang C, Yang Y, Hinton A, Yan C, Ding H, Zhu L, Yu L, Yang B, Feng Y, Clegg DJ, Khan S, DiMarchi R, Mani SK, Tong Q, Xu Y | title = Estrogens stimulate serotonin neurons to inhibit binge-like eating in mice | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 124 | issue = 10 | pages = 4351–62 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25157819 | pmc = 4191033 | doi = 10.1172/JCI74726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism by which estrogen replacement inhibits binge-like eating involves the replacement of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Women exhibiting binge eating behaviors are found to have increased brain uptake of neuron 5-HT, and therefore less of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;ref name=Jimerson&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jimerson DC, Lesem MD, Kaye WH, Hegg AP, Brewerton TD | title = Eating disorders and depression: is there a serotonin connection? | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 443–54 | date = September 1990 | pmid = 2207221 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3223(90)90412-u }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrogen works to activate 5-HT neurons, leading to suppression of binge like eating behaviors.&lt;ref name=Cao /&gt;

It is also suggested that there is an interaction between hormone levels and eating at different points in the female [[menstrual cycle]]. Research has predicted increased emotional eating during hormonal flux, which is characterized by high [[progesterone]] and [[estradiol]] levels that occur during the mid-[[luteal phase]]. It is hypothesized that these changes occur due to brain changes across the menstrual cycle that are likely a genomic effect of hormones. These effects produce menstrual cycle changes, which result in hormone release leading to behavioral changes, notably binge and emotional eating. These occur especially prominently among women who are genetically vulnerable to binge eating phenotypes.&lt;ref name=Klump2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klump KL, Keel PK, Racine SE, Burt SA, Burt AS, Neale M, Sisk CL, Boker S, Hu JY | title = The interactive effects of estrogen and progesterone on changes in emotional eating across the menstrual cycle | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 131–7 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 22889242 | pmc = 3570621 | doi = 10.1037/a0029524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binge eating is associated with decreased estradiol and increased progesterone.&lt;ref name=Edler&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edler C, Lipson SF, Keel PK | title = Ovarian hormones and binge eating in bulimia nervosa | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 131–41 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17038206 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291706008956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Klump et al.&lt;ref name=Klump2014 /&gt; Progesterone may moderate the effects of low estradiol (such as during dysregulated eating behavior), but that this may only be true in women who have had clinically diagnosed binge episodes (BEs). Dysregulated eating is more strongly associated with such ovarian hormones in women with BEs than in women without BEs.&lt;ref name=Klump2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klump KL, Racine SE, Hildebrandt B, Burt SA, Neale M, Sisk CL, Boker S, Keel PK | title = Ovarian Hormone Influences on Dysregulated Eating: A Comparison of Associations in Women with versus without Binge Episodes | journal = Clinical Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 545–559 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25343062 | pmc = 4203460 | doi = 10.1177/2167702614521794 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implantation of 17β-estradiol pellets in ovariectomized mice significantly reduced binge eating behaviors and injections of GLP-1 in ovariectomized mice decreased binge-eating behaviors.&lt;ref name=Cao /&gt;

The associations between binge eating, menstrual-cycle phase and ovarian hormones correlated.&lt;ref name=Edler /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klump2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klump KL, Keel PK, Culbert KM, Edler C | title = Ovarian hormones and binge eating: exploring associations in community samples | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 38 | issue = 12 | pages = 1749–57 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18307829 | pmc = 2885896 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291708002997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Klump2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lester&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lester NA, Keel PK, Lipson SF | title = Symptom fluctuation in bulimia nervosa: relation to menstrual-cycle phase and cortisol levels | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–60 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12537036 | doi = 10.1017/s0033291702006815 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Masculinization in rodents====
In rodents, estrogens (which are locally aromatized from androgens in the brain) play an important role in psychosexual differentiation, for example, by masculinizing territorial behavior;&lt;ref name="pmid19804754"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu MV, Manoli DS, Fraser EJ, Coats JK, Tollkuhn J, Honda S, Harada N, Shah NM | title = Estrogen masculinizes neural pathways and sex-specific behaviors | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–72 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19804754 | pmc = 2851224 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the same is not true in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid19707181"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rochira V, Carani C | title = Aromatase deficiency in men: a clinical perspective | journal = Nature Reviews.

===Bone/skeletal system===
Estrogens are responsible for both the pubertal growth spurt, which causes an acceleration in linear growth, and [[epiphyseal closure]], which limits [[human height|height]] and [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] length, in both females and males. In addition, estrogens are responsible for bone maturation and maintenance of [[bone mineral density]] throughout life. Due to hypoestrogenism, the risk of [[osteoporosis]] increases during [[menopause]].

===Cardiovascular system===
Women suffer less from heart disease due to vasculo-protective action of estrogen which helps in preventing atherosclerosis.&lt;ref name="pmid10500455"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosano GM, Panina G | title = Oestrogens and the heart | journal = Thérapie | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–5 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10500455 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Read full text or at least abstract and expand this article --&gt; It also helps in maintaining the delicate balance between fighting infections and protecting arteries from damage thus lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="pmid21836070"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nadkarni S, Cooper D, Brancaleone V, Bena S, Perretti M | title = Activation of the annexin A1 pathway underlies the protective effects exerted by estrogen in polymorphonuclear leukocytes | journal = Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology | volume = 31 | issue = 11 | pages = 2749–59 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21836070 | pmc = 3357483 | doi = 10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.235176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immune system===
Estrogen has [[anti-inflammatory]] properties and helps in mobilization of polymorphonuclear white blood cells or neutrophils.&lt;ref name="pmid21836070" /&gt;

===Associated conditions===
Estrogens are implicated in various [[estrogen-dependent condition]]s, such as ER-positive [[breast cancer]], as well as a number of [[genetic condition]]s involving estrogen signaling or metabolism, such as [[estrogen insensitivity syndrome]], [[aromatase deficiency]], and [[aromatase excess syndrome]].

Estrogens, in females, are produced primarily by the [[ovary|ovaries]], and during pregnancy, the [[placenta]].&lt;ref name=Marieb&gt;{{cite book | last = Marieb | first = Elaine | name-list-format = vanc | title = Anatomy &amp; physiology | publisher = Benjamin-Cummings | location = | page=903 | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-321-88760-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) stimulates the ovarian production of estrogens by the [[granulosa cell]]s of the [[ovarian follicle]]s and [[corpus luteum|corpora lutea]].

The pathway of estrogen biosynthesis in extragonadal tissues is different. These tissues are not able to synthesize C19 steroids, and therefore depend on C19 supplies from other tissues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson LR, Bulun SE | title = Estrogen production and action | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 45 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = S116-24 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11511861 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the level of aromatase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Labrie F, Bélanger A, Luu-The V, Labrie C, Simard J, Cusan L, Gomez JL, Candas B | title = DHEA and the intracrine formation of androgens and estrogens in peripheral target tissues: its role during aging | journal = Steroids | volume = 63 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 322–8 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9618795 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In females, synthesis of estrogens starts in [[theca interna]] cells in the ovary, by the synthesis of [[androstenedione]] from [[cholesterol]]. Androstenedione is a substance of weak androgenic activity which serves predominantly as a [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]] for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the [[basal membrane]] into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into estrone, or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is catalyzed by [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (17β-HSD), whereas the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by aromatase, enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack [[17α-hydroxylase]] and [[17,20-lyase]], whereas theca cells express these enzymes and 17β-HSD but lack aromatase. Hence, both granulosa and theca cells are essential for the production of estrogen in the ovaries.

Estrogen levels vary through the [[menstrual cycle]], with levels highest near the end of the [[follicular phase]] just before [[ovulation]].

Note that in males, estrogen is also produced by the Sertoli cells when FSH binds to their FSH receptors.

===Distribution===
Estrogens are [[plasma protein binding|plasma protein bound]] to [[human serum albumin|albumin]] and/or [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] in the circulation.

===Metabolism===
{{See also|Estradiol#Metabolism|Estradiol (medication)#Metabolism}}

Estrogens are [[metabolism|metabolized]] via [[hydroxylation]] by [[cytochrome P450]] [[enzyme]]s such as [[CYP1A1]] and [[CYP3A4]] and via [[conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugation]] by [[estrogen sulfotransferase]]s ([[sulfation]]) and [[UDP-glucuronyltransferase]]s ([[glucuronidation]]). In addition, estradiol is [[dehydrogenation|dehydrogenated]] by [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] into the much less potent estrogen estrone. These reactions occur primarily in the [[liver]], but also in other [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s.

The estrogen steroid hormones are [[estrane]] [[steroid]]s.

==History==
{{See also|Estradiol#History|Estrone#History|Estrogen (medication)#History}}

In 1929, [[Adolf Butenandt]] and [[Edward Adelbert Doisy]] independently isolated and purified estrone, the first estrogen to be discovered.&lt;ref name=pmid15940278&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400444 |pmid=15940278 |pmc=1369102 |title=One hundred years of hormones |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=490–6 |year=2005 |last1=Tata |first1=Jamshed R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, estriol and estradiol were discovered in 1930 and 1933, respectively. Shortly following their discovery, estrogens, both natural and synthetic, were introduced for medical use. Examples include [[estriol glucuronide]] ([[Emmenin]], [[Progynon]]), [[estradiol benzoate]], [[conjugated estrogens]] ([[Premarin]]), [[diethylstilbestrol]], and [[ethinylestradiol]].

The word estrogen derives from [[Ancient Greek]]. It is derived from "oestros&lt;ref name = "bioetymology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioetymology.blogspot.com.au/2011/03/estrogen-or-oestrogen.html | title = Origin in Biomedical Terms: oestrogen or oestrogen | website = Bioetymology | access-date = 2018-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;" (a periodic state of sexual activity in female mammals), and genos(generating).&lt;ref name = "bioetymology" /&gt; It was first published in the early 1920s and referenced as "oestrin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1936.02770410043011 |title=Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=107 |issue=15 |pages=1221–3 |year=1936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the years, American English adapted the spelling of estrogen to fit with its phonetic pronunciation. Nevertheless, both estrogen and oestrogen are used nowadays, yet some still wish to maintain its original spelling as it reflects the origin of the word.

==Society and culture==

===Etymology===
The name ''estrogen'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἶστρος}} (''oistros''), literally meaning "verve or inspiration" but figuratively sexual passion or desire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oistros&amp;la=greek | title = Greek Word Study Tool: oistros|publisher = [[Perseus Project|Perseus Digital Library]] | accessdate = 28 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the suffix ''[[wikt:-gen|-gen]]'', meaning "producer of".

===Environment===
A range of synthetic and natural substances that possess estrogenic activity have been identified in the [[natural environment|environment]] and are referred to [[xenoestrogen]]s.&lt;ref name=pmid11258977&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fang H, Tong W, Shi LM, Blair R, Perkins R, Branham W, Hass BS, Xie Q, Dial SL, Moland CL, Sheehan DM | title = Structure-activity relationships for a large diverse set of natural, synthetic, and environmental estrogens | journal = Chemical Research in Toxicology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 280–94 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11258977 | doi = 10.1021/tx000208y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Synthetic substances such as [[bisphenol A]] as well as [[metalloestrogen]]s (e.g., [[cadmium]]).
* Plant products with estrogenic activity are called [[phytoestrogen]]s (e.g., [[coumestrol]], [[daidzein]], [[genistein]], [[miroestrol]]).
* Those produced by fungi are known as [[mycoestrogens]] (e.g., [[zearalenone]]).

Estrogens are among the wide range of [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting compounds]] (EDCs) because they have high estrogenic potency. When an EDC makes its way into the environment, it may cause male reproductive dysfunction to wildlife.&lt;ref name="Wang_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang S, Huang W, Fang G, Zhang Y, Qiao H | title=Analysis of steroidal estrogen residues in food and environmental samples | journal = International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–25 | doi =10.1080/03067310701597293 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The estrogen excreted from farm animals makes its way into fresh water systems.&lt;ref name="pmid20977246"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise A, O'Brien K, Woodruff T | title = Are oral contraceptives a significant contributor to the estrogenicity of drinking water? | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–60 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20977246 | doi = 10.1021/es1014482 | laysummary = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/88/i44/8844news4.html | laysource = Chemical &amp; Engineering News }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the germination period of reproduction the fish are exposed to low levels of estrogen which may cause reproductive dysfunction to male fish.&lt;ref name="pmid16203238"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liney KE, Jobling S, Shears JA, Simpson P, Tyler CR | title = Assessing the sensitivity of different life stages for sexual disruption in roach (Rutilus rutilus) exposed to effluents from wastewater treatment works | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 113 | issue = 10 | pages = 1299–307 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16203238 | pmc = 1281270 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.7921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16818244"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jobling S, Williams R, Johnson A, Taylor A, Gross-Sorokin M, Nolan M, Tyler CR, van Aerle R, Santos E, Brighty G | title = Predicted exposures to steroid estrogens in U.K. rivers correlate with widespread sexual disruption in wild fish populations | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 114 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 32–9 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16818244 | pmc = 1874167 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.8050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmetics===
Some hair [[shampoo]]s on the market include estrogens and placental extracts; others contain [[phytoestrogens]]. In 1998, there were case reports of four prepubescent African-American girls developing breasts after exposure to these shampoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | vauthors = Sanghavi DM | title=Preschool Puberty, and a Search for the Causes | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 17 October 2006 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/science/17puberty.html |accessdate=4 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the FDA determined that not all [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] topically applied hormone-containing drug products for human use are [[generally recognized as safe and effective]] and are misbranded. An accompanying proposed rule deals with cosmetics, concluding that any use of natural estrogens in a cosmetic product makes the product an unapproved new drug and that any cosmetic using the term "hormone" in the text of its labeling or in its ingredient statement makes an implied drug claim, subjecting such a product to regulatory action.&lt;ref name="FDA cosmetics"&gt;{{cite web |author=FDA | date=February 1995 |title=Products containing estrogenic hormones, placental extract or vitamins |work=Guide to Inspections of Cosmetic Product Manufacturers |url=http://www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/cosmet.html |accessdate=24 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014014542/http://www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/cosmet.html |archivedate = 14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being considered misbranded drugs, products claiming to contain placental extract may also be deemed to be misbranded cosmetics if the extract has been prepared from placentas from which the hormones and other biologically active substances have been removed and the extracted substance consists principally of protein. The FDA recommends that this substance be identified by a name other than "placental extract" and describing its composition more accurately because consumers associate the name "placental extract" with a therapeutic use of some biological activity.&lt;ref name="FDA cosmetics"/&gt;

'''Evidence-based nursing''' ('''EBN''') is an approach to making quality decisions and providing nursing care based upon personal clinical expertise in combination with the most current, relevant research available on the topic. This approach is using [[evidence-based practice]] (EBP) as a foundation. EBN implements the most up to date methods of providing care, which have been proven through appraisal of high quality studies and [[statistically significant]] research findings. The goal of EBN is to improve the health and safety of patients while also providing care in a cost-effective manner to improve the outcomes for both the patient and the [[healthcare system]]. EBN is a process founded on the collection, interpretation, appraisal, and integration of valid, clinically significant, and applicable research. The evidence used to change practice or make a clinical decision can be separated into seven levels of evidence that differ in type of study and level of quality. To properly implement EBN, the knowledge of the nurse, the patient's preferences, and multiple studies of evidence must all be collaborated and utilized in order to produce an appropriate solution to the task at hand. These skills are taught in modern [[nursing education]] and also as a part of professional training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Melnyk|first=B.M.|title=Evidence-based practice in nursing &amp; healthcare: A guide to best practice|date=2011|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-60547-778-7|pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 7 Steps of EBP==

===Cultivate Spirit of Inquiry===
A spirit of inquiry refers to an attitude in which questions are encouraged to be asked about existing practices. Cultivating a spirit of inquiry allows healthcare providers to feel comfortable with questioning current methods of practice and challenging these practices to create improvements and change. A culture that fosters this should have a philosophy that incorporates EBP, access to tools that can  enhance EBP, and administrative support and leadership that values EBP.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melnyk|last2=Fineout-Overholt|first1=B.M.|first2=E.|title=Evidence-based practice in nursing &amp; healthcare: A guide to best practice.|edition=3rd|date=2015|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health.|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4511-9094-6|pages=10–16|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;Key Elements to Foster EBP&lt;/u&gt; 
# Always question current practices as nursing professional. 
# Integrate EBP as higher standard/mission/philosophy and include competencies for EBP. 
# EBP mentors for skills and knowledge availability to others to provide and help. 
# Tools to enhance EBP (e.g. meetings, educational/classroom time, access to, etc.). 
# Higher level support and ability for leaders to model valued EBP skills.

===Ask Clinical Question (PICOT)===
[[PICO_process|PICOT]] formatted questions address the patient population (P), issue of interest or intervention (I), comparison group (C), outcome (O), and time frame (T). Asking questions in this format assists in generating a search that produces the most relevant, quality information related to a topic, while also decreasing the amount of time needed to produce these search results. 
*An example of an intervention focused PICOT question would be: In total knee arthroplasty patients (Population), what is the effect of nerve blocks (Intervention) compared to opioid pain medication (Comparison) in controlling post-operative pain (Outcome) within the first 24 hours after surgery (Time)? 
*An example of an issue of interest focused PICOT question would be: How do post-rehab chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (Population) with stage 3 (Issue of Interest) perceive their ability to perform activities of daily living (Outcome) after first month (Time) of rehabilitation? [No comparison group].&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

===Search for and Collect Relevant Evidence===
To begin the search for evidence, use each keyword from the PICOT question that was formed. Once results have been found on the intervention or treatment, the research can be rated to determine which provides the strongest level of evidence. There are seven levels of evidence, with a level I being of the strongest quality and a level VII being of the weakest quality:
*Level I: Evidence from systematic reviews or meta-analysis of randomized control trials
*Level II: Evidence from well-designed randomized control trials
*Level III: Evidence from well-designed control trials that are not randomized
*Level IV: Evidence from case-control or cohort studies
*Level V: Evidence from systematic reviews of descriptive or qualitative studies
*Level VI: Evidence from a single descriptive or qualitative study
*Level VII: Evidence from expert opinions 
The strongest levels of evidence, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, summarize evidence related to a specific topic by finding and assessing studies that specifically relate to the question being asked. Meta-analyses are systematic reviews that also use quantitative measures such as statistics to summarize the results of the studies analyzed.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;Pyramid framework.&lt;/u&gt; Thinking of the information resources used to obtain evidence as a pyramid can help determine what the most valid and least biased evidence is. The top of the pyramid is just that. This is where decision support can be found, which is found within the medical record. The middle of the pyramid is the reviews of the evidence. This includes systematic reviews, practice guidelines, topic summaries, and article synopses. The bottom of the pyramid is the original studies. The bottom is also considered the foundation of the pyramid and where evidence begins. This includes research articles. Those who look for evidence here need special knowledge and skills to not only find the evidence itself but how to evaluate its worthiness.
&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melnyk|last2=Fineout-Overholt|first1=B.M.|first2=E.|title=Evidence-based practice in nursing &amp; healthcare: A guide to best practice.|edition=3rd|date=2015|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health.|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4511-9094-6|page=45|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critically Appraise the Evidence===
To begin the critical appraisal process, three questions need to asked to determine the relevance of evidence and if evidence applies to population being cared for. The three questions are: 
#Are the results of the study valid?
#What are the results?
#Will the results be applicable in caring for patients?
*Question 1 measures the validity. In order to be valid, the results of the study must be as close to the truth as possible. Also, the study must be conducted using best available research methods. 
*Question 2 measures the reliability of the study. If it is an intervention study, reliability consists of: whether the intervention worked, how large the effect was, and whether a clinician could repeat the study with similar results. If it is a qualitative study, reliability would be measured by determining if the research accomplished the purpose of the study. 
*Question 3 measures the applicability. The study may be used in practice when caring for patients if the subjects are similar to the patients being cared for, the benefit outweighs the harm, the study is feasible, and the patient desires the treatment. 
After asking these three questions, evidence appraisal continues by creating an evidence synthesis. This synthesis compares multiple studies to see if they are in agreement with each other.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

===Integrate the Evidence===
After appraising the evidence, it is necessary to integrate it with the provider's expertise and patient's preferences. The patient is encouraged to practice autonomy and participate in the decision-making process. Therefore, even if the study had successful outcomes, the patient may refuse to receive a treatment. Assessment findings and patient history may reveal further contraindications to a certain evidence-based treatment. Lastly, availability of healthcare resources may limit the implementation of a treatment even if it is found to be effective in a study.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

===Evaluate Outcomes===
The next step in the evidence-based practice process is to evaluate whether the treatment was effective in terms of patient outcomes. It is important to evaluate the outcomes in a real-world clinical setting to determine the impact of the evidence-based change on healthcare quality.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

===Disseminate Outcomes===
The last step is to share the information especially if positive outcomes are achieved. By sharing the results of evidence-based practice process, others may benefit. Some methods to disseminate the information include presentations at conferences, rounds within one's own institution, and journal publications.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

== Qualitative research process ==
One method of research for evidence-based practice in nursing is 'qualitative research': "The word implies a entity and meanings that are not experimentally examined or measured in terms of quantity, amount, frequency, or intensity."  
With qualitative research, researchers learn about patient experiences through discussions and interviews. The point of qualitative research is to provide beneficial descriptions that allow insight into patient experiences.  
"Hierarchies if research evidence traditionally categorize evidence from weakest to strongest, with  an emphasis on support for the effectiveness of interventions. That this perspective tends to dominate the evidence-based practice literature makes the merit of qualitative research unclear;" &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;   Some people view qualitative research as less beneficial and effective, with its lack of numbers, the fact that it is "feeling-based" research, makes the opponents associate it with bias. Nevertheless, the ability to empathetically understand an individual's experience (whether it be with cancer, pressure ulcers, trauma, etc.), can benefit not only other patients, but the health care workers providing care.

For qualitative research to be reliable, the testing must be unbiased. To achieve this, researchers must use random and non-random samples to obtain concise information about the topic being studied. If available, a control group should be in use, if possible with the qualitative studies that are done. Evidence should be gathered from every available subject within the sample to create balance and dissolve any bias. There should also be several researchers doing the interviewing to obtain different perspectives about the subject. Researchers must also obtain negative information as well as the positive information gathered to support the data. This will help to show the researchers were unbiased and were not trying to hide negative results from readers, and actually makes it possible to objectively understand the phenomenon under investigation. The inclusion of this negative information will strengthen the researchers' initial study, and may actually work in favor to support the hypothesis. Any data that has been gathered must be appropriately documented. If the data collected was obtained from interviews or observation, it must all be included. 
Dates, times and gender of the sample may be needed, providing background on subjects, such as breast cancer in women over thirty-five. Any pertinent information pertaining to the sample must be included for the reader to judge the study as worthy.

In addition, the current evidence-based practice (EBP) movement in healthcare emphasizes that clinical decision making should be based on the "best evidence" available, preferably the findings of randomized clinical trials. Within this context qualitative research findings are considered to have little value and the old debate in nursing has been re-ignited related as to whether qualitative versus quantitative research findings provides the best empirical evidence for nursing practice. 
In response to this crisis qualitative scholars have been called upon by leaders in the field to clarify for outsiders what qualitative research is and to be more explicit in pointing out the utility of qualitative research findings. 
In addition, attention to "quality" in qualitative research has been identified as an area worthy of renewed focus. Within this paper two key problems related to addressing these issues are reviewed: disagreement not only among "outsiders" but also some nursing scholars related to the definition of "qualitative research", and a lack of consensus related how to best address "rigor" in this type of inquiry.

Based on this review a set of standard requirements for qualitative research published in nursing journals is proposed that reflects a uniform definition of qualitative research and an enlarged yet clearly articulated conceptualization of quality. The approach suggested provides a framework for developing and evaluating qualitative research that would have both defensible scholarly merit and heuristic value. This will help solidify the argument in favor of incorporating qualitative research findings as part of the empirical "evidence" upon which evidence-based nursing is founded.

==Legal and ethical issues of research==
Both legal and ethical issues are important in considering patient-based research. The American Nurses Association (ANA) has set up five basic rights for patient protection:

#Right to self-determination
#Right to privacy and dignity
#Right to anonymity and confidentiality
#Right to fair treatment 
#Right to protection from discomfort and harm.

These rights apply to both researchers and participants.  [[Informed consent]] is one area that nurses must be familiar with in order to complete research.  Informed consent is "the legal principle that governs the patient's ability to accept or reject individual medical interventions designed to diagnose or treat an illness".  Informed consent can only be obtained before the procedure and after potential risks have been explained to the participant. When dealing with the ethical portion of evidence-based practice, the [[Institutional Review Board]]s (IRB) review research projects to assess that ethical standards are being followed.  The institutional review board is responsible for protecting subjects from risk and loss of personal rights and dignity. The IRB also come into play when deciding on which populations can be included in research.  Vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, physically disabled or elderly maybe excluded from the process. Nurses must notify the IRB of any ethical or legal violations.

It is important to be up to date on all the appropriate state laws and regulations regarding vulnerable populations.  This may mean consulting with lawyers, clinicians, ethicists, as well as the affiliated IRB.  It is imperative that researchers act as advocates for these vulnerable persons that cannot do so for themselves.

==Barriers to promoting evidence-based practice==
The use of evidence-based practice depends a great deal on the nursing student's proficiency at understanding and critiquing the research articles and the associated literature that will be presented to them in the clinical setting.  According to, Blythe Royal, author of ''Promoting Research Utilization in nursing:  The Role of the Individual, Organization, and Environment'', a large amount of the preparation requirements of nursing students consists of creating care plans for patients, covering in depth processes of pathophysiology, and retaining the complex information of pharmacology.  These are indeed very important for the future of patient care, but their knowledge must consist of more when they begin to practice.  Evidence-based nursing in an attempt to facilitate the management of the growing literature and technology accessible to healthcare providers that can potentially improve patient care and their outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Royal J, Blythe J |title=Promoting research utilisation in nursing: the role of the individual, organisation, and environment. Evidence-Based Nursing |date=July 1, 1998 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=71–72 |url=http://ebn.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/1/3/71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nancy Dickenson-Hazard states, "Nurses have the capacity to serve as caregivers and change agents in creating and implementing community and population-focused health systems."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Dickenson-Hazard (2004) Global Health Issues and Challenges 
Journal of Nursing Scholarship 36 (1), 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a need to overcome the barriers to encourage the use of research by new graduates in an attempt to ensure familiarity with the process. This will help nurses to feel more confident and be more willing to engage in evidence-based nursing. A survey that was established by the Honor Society of Nursing and completed by registered nurses proved that 69% have only a low to moderate knowledge of EBP and half of those that responded did not feel sure of the steps in the process.  Many responded, "lack of time during their shift is the primary challenge to researching and applying EBP."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090310021219/http://www.nursingsociety.org/Media/Pages/EPBrel.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  There is always and will always be a desire to improve the care of our patients.  The ever-increasing cost of healthcare and the need for more accuracy in the field proves a cycle in need of evidence-based healthcare.  The necessity to overcome the current issues is to gain knowledge from a variety of literature not just the basics.  There is a definite need for nurses, and all practitioners, to have an open mind when dealing with the modern inventions of the future because these could potentially improve the health of patients.
 
There are many barriers to promoting evidence-based practice. The first of which would be the practitioner's ability to critically appraise research. This includes having a considerable amount of research evaluation skills, access to journals, and clinic/hospital support to spend time on EBN. Time, workload pressures, and competing priorities can impede research and development. The causes of these barriers include nurses' and other professional practitioners' lack of knowledge of research methods, lack of support from professional colleagues and organizations, and lack of confidence and authority in the research arena.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor S; Allen D Nurse Researcher, 2007; 15 (1): 78-83 (journal article)CINAHL&lt;/ref&gt;
Another barrier is that the practice environment can be resistant to changing tried and true conventional methods of practice. This can be caused because of reluctance to believe results of research study over safe, traditional practices, cost of adopting new practices, or gaining momentum to rewrite existing protocols.&lt;ref&gt;Loyd, G. 2008. EBP Readings. Nursing Theory Research Handout. East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to show nurses who may be resistant to changes in nursing practice the benefits that nurses, their patients, and their institutions can reap from the implementation of evidence-based nursing practice, which is to provide better nursing care.&lt;ref&gt;Med-Surg Matters, Jul2007; 16 (4): 1, 13 (journal article) CINAHL&lt;/ref&gt; Values, resources and evidence are the three factors that influence decision-making with regard to health care. All registered nurses and health care professionals should be taught to read and critically interpret research and know where to find articles which relate to their field of care. In addition, nurses need to be more aware of how to assess the information and determine its applicability to their practice.&lt;ref&gt;Castledine G British Journal of Nursing (BJN), CINAHL 10/9/97; 6 (18): 1077 (journal article)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another barrier to implementing EBN into practice is lack of continuing education programs.&lt;ref&gt;Salmond, Susan W. EdD.  "Advancing Evidence-Based Practice:  A Primer."  Orthopaedic Nursing, March/April 2007, Volume 26, Number 2, pgs 114-123.&lt;/ref&gt;  Practices do not have the means to provide workshops to teach new skills due to lack of funding, staff, and time; therefore, the research may be tossed dismissed.  If this occurs, valuable treatments may never be utilized in patient care.  Not only will the patients suffer but the staff will not have the opportunity to learn a new skill.  Also, the practitioners may not be willing to implement change regardless of the benefits to patient care.

Another barrier to introducing newly learned methods for improving treatments or patients' health is the fear of "stepping on one's toes".  New nurses might feel it is not their place to suggest or even tell a superior nurse that newer, more efficient methods and/or practices are available.

Even if clinicians do act consistently it is possible that their decisions are consistently biased.  People put different values on gains and losses. Tversky and Kahneman gave people the two identical problems (with the same probabilities of life and death outcomes - see fig 1) but framed the outcome choices as either lives saved or as deaths.10 Most people wanted to avoid taking risks with gains which could be safeguarded, but would take risks with losses which might be avoided; this is a framing effect. If people are given identical options but different words are used to emphasize a gain rather than a loss, then a different response is given by a large proportion of the population under study. Such a change in response appears to be inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Health Education Authority. Oral Health Effectiveness Review No 7. Effectiveness of oral health promotion. London: HEA, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation and sustainability==
The Iowa Model is used to promote quality of care. It is a guideline for nurses in their decision making process. The decision making can include clinical and administration practices. These practices affect patient outcomes. The model is based on problem-solving steps at are a part of the scientific process. Recognition for applicability and ease of use. Key components of using the Iowa Model: 
#Identify "triggers" 
#Clinical applications 
#Organizational priorities
#Forming a team
#Piloting a practice change
#Evaluating the pilot
#Evaluate change and share results
*First, identify "triggers", which can be either problem focused or knowledge focused. These can be the important questions that arise from current practices. With knowledge focus, nurses can question a current practice due to shared scientific knowledge. This knowledge can be in the form of research or national guidelines for example. With problem focus, nurses can find room for improvement from already existing facts. 
*Second, clinical application is how nurses figure out the importance of the question identified and the relevance by using the EBP process. 
*Third, organizational priorities is ranking the question by the priorities of the organization. High priority given to areas that focus on high-volume/risk/cost, organization’s plan, or motivated by other forces. Knowing where a question lies in priorities can be a determination factor of getting the necessities needed to do an EBP projection for that organization. 
*Fourth, forming a team is possible once agreeance occurs. The team is assembled to create, do, and evaluate the change. It is a multi-disciplinary functioning team with various skill sets and networks. 
*Fifth, the piloting of a practice change is the essential step to this process. Having a selected area of the organization to pilot the practice change can help identify any issues that arise from implementation of the change before the change is spread throughout the organization. This is a multiple step process. 
*Sixth, the evaluation of the pilot is the decision making process that evaluates if the pilot is accomplishing the goals of implementation, which is the quality of care provided improving, due to this pilot or not. It can involve either problem solving of the issues being had, dropping the implementation completely/postponing, or going ahead and implementing. 
*Lastly, the EBP changes continued to be monitored with reports of quality and performance improvements being noted. Sharing the results with the rest of the organization is key for learning. It also promotes the EBP culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melnyk|last2=Fineout-Overholt|first1=B.M.|first2=E.|title=Evidence-based practice in nursing &amp; healthcare: A guide to best practice.|edition=3rd|date=2015|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health.|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4511-9094-6|pages=283–287|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5972">The '''Florida Mental Health Act of 1971''' ([[Florida]] Statute 394.451-394.47891&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0300-0399/0394/0394ContentsIndex.html&amp;StatuteYear=2013&amp;Title=%2D%3E2013%2D%3EChapter%20394&lt;/ref&gt; [2009 rev.]), commonly known as the "'''Baker Act'''," allows the [[involuntary commitment|involuntary institutionalization]] and examination of an individual.

The Baker Act allows for involuntary examination (what some call [[involuntary commitment|emergency or involuntary commitment]]).  It can be initiated by judges, law enforcement officials, physicians, or mental health professionals.  There must be evidence that the person:

* possibly has a mental illness (as defined in the Baker Act).
* is in danger of becoming a harm to self, harm to others, or is self neglectful (as defined in the Baker Act).

Examinations may last up to 72 hours after a person is deemed medically stable and occur in over 100 [[Florida Department of Children and Families]]-designated receiving facilities statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/programs/samh/mentalhealth/docs/Baker%20Act%20Receiving%20Faciliites.pdf|title=Baker Act Receiving Facilities|date=February 2017|publisher=Florida Dept. of Children and Families|access-date=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many possible outcomes following examination of the patient.  This includes the release of the individual to the community (or other community placement), a petition for involuntary inpatient placement (what some call civil commitment), involuntary outpatient placement (what some call outpatient commitment or assisted treatment orders), or voluntary treatment (if the person is competent to consent to voluntary treatment and consents to voluntary treatment).  The involuntary outpatient placement language in the Baker Act took effect as part of the Baker Act reform in 2005.

The legislation was nicknamed "Baker Act" after Florida Democratic state representative from Miami, [[Maxine Baker (politician)|Maxine Baker]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/programs/samh/MentalHealth/laws/histba.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; who served from 1963 to 1972. She had a strong interest in mental health issues, served as chair of the House Committee on Mental Health, and was the sponsor of the bill.

The nickname has led to the term "Baker Act" as a [[transitive verb]], and "Baker Acted" as a passive-voice verb, for invoking the Act to force an individual's commitment. Although the Baker Act is a statute only for the state of Florida, use of "Baker Acting" as a verb has become prevalent as a [[slang]] term for involuntary commitment in other regions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;North Port police scandal spreading to more officers?; by Bobeth Yates, 2 April 2014, WWSB&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}

==Clarification of Baker Act criteria==
Specific criteria must be met in order to initiate involuntary examination. Among those criteria are the following elements, that ''by themselves'', do ''not'' qualify an individual as having met or meeting the criteria:

Reason to believe that the person has a mental illness; refusal of voluntary examination; the person is unable to determine whether examination is necessary. Criteria are not met simply because a person has mental illness, appears to have mental problems, takes psychiatric medication, or has an emotional outburst. Criteria are not met simply because a person refuses voluntary examination. Criteria are not met if there are family members or friends that will help prevent any potential and present threat of substantial harm.

The decisive criterion, as stated in the statute, mentions a substantial likelihood that without care or treatment the person will cause serious bodily harm in the near future.  ("Substantial" means ample, considerable, firm or strong.)

To further clarify this point of substantial likelihood, there must be evidence of recent behavior to justify the substantial likelihood of serious bodily harm in the near future. Moments in the past, when an individual may have considered harming themselves or another, do not qualify the individual as meeting the criteria. ("Near" means close, short, or draws near.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0300-0399/0394/0394.html|title = Statutes &amp; Constitution : View Statutes : Online Sunshine|website = www.leg.state.fl.us|access-date = 2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception ==
An editorial in the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' wrote that crisis stabilization is a Band-Aid solution to emotional problems" and the Act should be reformed to allow public defenders to have access to the patient's medical records and ongoing counseling and outpatient mental health treatment should be provided to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Tampa Bay Times | title=Editorial: Florida Legislature should reform Baker Act | date=July 3, 2015 | access-date=July 7, 2015 | url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-florida-legislature-should-reform-baker-act/2236045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[international politics]], '''food power''' is the use of [[agriculture]] as a means of political control whereby one nation or group of nations offers or withholds commodities from another nation or group of nations in order to manipulate behavior. Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after [[OPEC]]’s earlier use of oil as a political weapon. Food has a major influence on political actions of a nation. In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.

Food power is an integral part of the [[food politics|politics of food]]. The idea of food power is used in [[embargo]]es, employment, and food politics. In order for a nation to utilize food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="jpr281"/&gt; On the smaller scale, particularly in some [[Africa]]n countries, food power has been used as a weapon by opposing sides in internal wars and conflicts against their own people.

==Historical background==
There are four nations in the world that export enough agriculture to exert this hypothetical food power: the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=jpr281&gt;{{cite journal|author= Peter Wallensteen|title=Scarce Goods as Political Weapons: The Case of Food|journal=Journal of Peace Research|date=1976|volume=13|issue=4|page=281|doi=10.1177/002234337601300402|ref={{harvid|Wallensteen|1976}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forced to rely on these nations in times of shortage, food-importing countries may face food crises if needed supplies are withheld. But while political leaders in food-importing countries have expressed misgivings over their dependence,&lt;ref name=jpr281/&gt; food-exporting nations generally do not withhold food, as agricultural producers in these nations press their governments to continue to export.&lt;ref name=foodpolitics&gt;Robert Paarlberg, Food Politics, The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World, 2008 [http://www.mywire.com/a/Oxford-Companion-Politics-World/Food-Politics/9577797/?&amp;pbl=105]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy==
[[File:2005food import.png|thumb|300px|Food [[import]]s in 2005]]
Food politics are the political aspects of the production, control, regulation, inspection and distribution of food. The politics can be affected by the ethical, cultural, medical and environmental disputes concerning proper farming, agricultural and retailing methods and regulations. Food power is an integral part of the [[food politics|politics of food]].{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=278}}

“Food is a weapon”, stated Earl Butz, the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]], in 1974.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=277}} [[OPEC]]'s use of oil as a political weapon brought on the possibility for America to use food as a tool against other states and to further the US's goals.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=277}}
There are alternative uses of food power as well. An importer can refuse to continue import unless [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] are made. This would have the same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=278}} An example of this would be American reduction of the Cuban [[sugar]] quota. In simple terms, the demand concentration (one importer being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several exporters competing to sell the same product) an importer can try to use this exchange politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export (low action independence).{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=278}}

===Food power and food security===
[[Food Security|Food security]] and food power are not the same thing.&lt;ref name=scienedirect157&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Simon Maxwell|title=Food security: a post-modern perspective|journal=Food Policy|date=May 1996|volume=21|issue=2|page=157|doi=10.1016/0306-9192(95)00074-7|ref={{harvid|Maxwell|1996}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are often directly related. Food security is when all people of a region at all times have enough food for an active, healthy life.&lt;ref name=scienedirect157/&gt; Food power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away in order to get something in return. Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country's food security. A country's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of food for its citizens. This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating food power.{{sfn|Maxwell|1996|p=158}}

===Food power and embargoes===
[[Image:Fidel Castro - UN General Assembly 1960.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Fidel Castro]] at a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly]]
An [[embargo]] is not the same as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo.&lt;ref name=parameters24&gt;Robert A. Doughty and Harold E. Raugh, Embargoes in Historical Perspective, Parameters, 1991, pg. 24 [http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/1991/1991%20doughty%20and%20raugh.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of restricted items often fail.&lt;ref name=parameters26&gt;Robert A. Doughty and Harold E. Raugh, Embargoes in Historical Perspective, Parameters, 1991, pg. 26 [http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/1991/1991%20doughty%20and%20raugh.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on August 20, 1914 the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=parameters26/&gt; However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials.&lt;ref name=parameters26/&gt; Food has the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food.&lt;ref name=parameters26/&gt; Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.&lt;ref name=parameters27&gt;Robert A. Doughty and Harold E. Raugh, Embargoes in Historical Perspective, Parameters, 1991, pg. 27 [http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/1991/1991%20doughty%20and%20raugh.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, the United States posed a [[United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union|grain embargo]] upon the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=foodpolitics/&gt; This was an attempt by the U.S. utilize food power, however, it was not confirmed.&lt;ref name=foodpolitics/&gt; The Soviets thus imported grain from different suppliers, leading to an increase in grain imports during that time period, only at a higher cost.&lt;ref name=foodpolitics/&gt; Another unsuccessful embargo food power attempt was imposed by the [[UN Security Council]] in 1990 upon [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]].&lt;ref name=foodpolitics/&gt;

Another example of an embargo is the United States [[embargo against Cuba]]. This is still an ongoing embargo, and, due to the declining situation and health of Cuba's people, the embargo has been subject to much protest.&lt;ref name=Alternatives&gt;Rémy Herrera, The Effects of the U.S. Embargo Against Cuba, Alternatives, 2003 [http://www.alternatives.ca/eng/our-organisation/our-publications/analysis-and-articles/article/the-effects-of-the-us-embargo?lang=fr]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==

===Structural conditions===
Food power can only be used effectively if certain structural conditions apply:{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=278}}
# Scarcity: If demand is high and supply is limited the value of a given [[commodity]] increases. The price often reflects the potential of the goods as a weapon;{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=278}} as it indicates the importance attached to it.  Example: If a consumer is prepared to pay a high price for monetary terms he may also be willing to pay a high price in political concessions.
# Supply Concentration: Supply should only be in the hands of few producers/ sellers, as this makes possible for limited competition, price fixes, or potentially a [[monopoly]].{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=278}}
# Demand Dispersion: Allows sellers to play the consumers against each other as well as increase prices or make terms conditional.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=278}} This favors the use of economic goods food as a weapon.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=278}}
# Action Independence: In order to ensure affectivity the seller/producer most control his own assets. Either the seller/producer must be able to control the production process, perhaps through governmental control over companies carrying out the production), or he must have access to means on the other dimensions to ensure that he can maintain or extend control over his assets.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=279}}

The four conditions listed above MUST be simultaneously present in order to turn an economic asset food into a political instrument.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=280}} This does not necessarily mean that the asset will be used whenever the four conditions above are present. Such a decision would be considered only if there were further conditions, for example, the nature of a given conflict and judgment, goals, alternative means, and judgment of utility.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=280}}

===Employment as an economic weapon===
There are several uses for employing economic weapons against one country or another. One use for using economic weapons would concern the seller/buyer bargaining on the conditions of a business contract.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=280}} This would include price, transportation, timetable for consignment and payment, etc.  Although this is an example of the successful application of food power, it is not a political objective.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=280}} Another use concerns the economic objectives other than these relating to the transaction of goods; to the general economic policy of the buyer.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=280}} This would be balance of payments, general problems, such as inflation or taxation and land holding.  What distinguishes this from the first is the fact that there is no link between the conditions laid down and the transfer of product.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=280}} The conditions refer to the economic realm of life.  A political use would be one concerning the buyer’s foreign and defense policies.  Many believe there is a moral threshold between economy and politics, making the use of economic means for political gains questionable.  Examples of the use of economic weapons for political aims are boycotts against certain countries as well as the buying of votes in the UN.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=280}} A fourth purpose pertains to the basic assumption of the third category: the governments no longer accept each other as legitimate.  The economic goals are no longer seen as a means of influencing an opposite government but rather to stimulate opposition and achieve the overthrow or capitulation of the government.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=280}}

===United States===
[[File:Barley.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Barley]] is a major animal [[feed crop]].]]
During the time the United States was the most dominant in all areas like military, energy, exports, etc. Food Power was not really thought about.&lt;ref name=Food25&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert L. Paarlberg|title=Food as an Instrument of Foreign Policy|journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science|volume=34|issue=3|date= 1982|page=25|jstor=1173726|ref={{harvid|Paarlberg|1982}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since some of those powers have since diminished, the power of food has come to the surface.&lt;ref name=Food25/&gt; In the realm of food, The United States remains at the top, unchallenged.&lt;ref name=Food25/&gt; The United States has the position of being the largest producer and exporter of food.{{sfn|Paarlberg|1982|p=26}}  While others nations, predominantly developing nations but even some of the richest oil-exporting nations,&lt;ref name=Food25/&gt; are beginning to have food shortages and becoming more and more dependent on imported food from the United States, giving it more and more power.&lt;ref name=Food25/&gt; This allows the United States to expect friendly behavior from the countries that import American food.{{sfn|Paarlberg|1982|p=26}}  It is also likely that the United States would have some form of influence over these countries.{{sfn|Paarlberg|1982|p=26}} Even some of the poorest [[OPEC]] countries have become dependent on U.S. wheat.{{sfn|Paarlberg|1982|p=29}} Therefore, there is a possibility that the United States could restrict its food exports for political purposes.{{sfn|Paarlberg|1982|p=29}}  The United States could use this Food power as a means of exerting pressure on OPEC countries.{{sfn|Paarlberg|1982|p=29}}  Food power will be most effective in times of food shortage or famine because this is when those countries that have some dependence on the United States are most desperate.{{sfn|Paarlberg|1982|p=26}}

The U.S. frequently uses its economic power in order to punish other countries.  One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food.   Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they can be broken down into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=292}}  The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S.  An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government.  More examples related to the containment objective would be no aid to communist countries, socialist governments, countries who support radical regimes, regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti-communist (effectively), and countries who will not accept U.S. agreements.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=292}}  An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically.  The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies.{{sfn|Wallensteen|1976|p=292}}

The U.S. has modified its stance since the 1970s, when the State Department and the CIA issued reports exploring the potential of food embargoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The international grain trade: problems and prospects|author=Nick Butler|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yu8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=food+embargoes+kissinger+state+department&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=food%20embargoes%20kissinger%20state%20department&amp;f=false|page=27 | isbn=978-0-7099-4218-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressional Bill H.R. 5426, the [[Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000]], removed agricultural export sanctions applied to [[Libya]], [[Sudan]], and [[North Korea]] (agricultural trade with [[Cuba]] remained under some restrictions) and gave Congress veto power over unilateral presidential actions in this regard.&lt;ref name=crs2&gt;{{cite web|title=Exempting Food and Agriculture Products from U.S. Economic Sanctions: Status and Implementation|date=2006-06-29|url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RL33499.pdf|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], republished by [[National Agricultural Law Center]] at the [[University of Arkansas]]|accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade With Cuba|publisher=[[USDA]]|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/cuba/cuba.asp|date=2009-01-12|accessdate=2010-01-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114054224/http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/cuba/cuba.asp|archivedate=2010-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Food politics in Africa differs from the cases in North America and Europe in that there is a case of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan.&lt;ref name=Africa172&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ray Bush|title= The Politics of Food and Starvation|journal= Review of African Political Economy |volume=23|issue=68|date= 1996|page=172|doi=10.1080/03056249608704194|jstor=4006247|ref={{harvid|Bush|1996}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability.{{sfn|Bush|1996|p=170}} But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.{{sfn|Bush|1996|p=170}}

====Sudan====
[[Image:Sudan sat.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite image of [[Sudan]]]]
[[Famine]] is shaped by generally two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline.&lt;ref name=Africa172/&gt; This is the result of a [[drought]], a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system.{{sfn|Bush|1996|p=171}} This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food.&lt;ref name=Africa172/&gt; In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.&lt;ref name=Africa172/&gt;

For example, [[Sudan]]’s famine in the 1980s was completely intentional, and was only a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses.{{sfn|Bush|1996|p=189}} These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade.{{sfn|Bush|1996|p=171}} Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in [[Darfur]] at reasonable prices.&lt;ref name=Africa172/&gt; Ergo, the Sudanese Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored the needs of the people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.{{sfn|Bush|1996|p=189}}

The [[famine in Sudan in 1998]] was a humanitarian disaster caused mainly by [[human rights]] abuses, as well as [[drought]] and the failure of the [[international community]] to react to the [[famine]] risk with adequate speed.&lt;ref name="HRW 2 P374"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/sudan/SUDAWEB2.htm#P374_19682 Famine In Sudan, 1998] Human Rights Watch, Accessed May 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The worst affected area was [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr El Ghazal]] in southwestern [[Sudan]].  In this region over 70,000 people died during the famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ó Gráda|first=Cormac|year=2009|title=Famine: a short history|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|page=24|isbn=978-0-691-12237-3|postscript=.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LoN2XkjJio4C&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gladys Block''' is a nutrition researcher who worked at the [[National Cancer Institute]].

== Education and career ==
From July 1991 onward, Block worked at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as a professor (and subsequently professor emerita) of Community Health and Human Development in the School of Public Health.&lt;ref name=sph&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sph.berkeley.edu/gladys-block|title = Gladys Block PhD|publisher = School of Public Health, [[University of California, Berkeley]]|accessdate = October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chj&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.centerforhealthjournalism.org/resources/sources/gladys-block|title = Gladys Blcock: Expert Profile|publisher = [[Center for Health Journalism]]|accessdate = October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
=== Vitamins ===
In 1992, Block's review of 15 epidemiological studies on cancer rates and intake of Vitamin C was mentioned in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=nyt-vitamin-win&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/10/science/vitamins-win-support-as-potent-agents-of-health.html?pagewanted=all|title = Vitamins Win Support as Potent Agents of Health|date = March 10, 1992|accessdate = October 25, 2016|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Block has been cited in media coverage of the debate around the efficacy of dietary multivitamin supplements in combating health risks including the risk of cancer, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Others taking a similar position as Block (in favor of dietary supplements) include Harvard professor [[Walter Willett]] (designer of the Harvard FFQ), researcher [[Bruce N. Ames]], and Michael Jacobson of the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]]. Those on the other side include Marion Nestle, Joan Gussow, Catherine Wotecki, Walter Mertz, and Edgar Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/14/garden/eating-well.html|title = Eating Well|last = Burros|first = Marian|date = April 14, 1993|accessdate = October 25, 2016|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/20/garden/eating-well.html|title = Eating Well|date = April 20, 1994|accessdate = October 25, 2016|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/16/health/multivitamins-studies/|title = Are multivitamins a waste of money?

=== Variety in diet ===
Block has led research on the variety in people's diet and its effects on people's nutrient consumption and health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/57/3/434.abstract|title = Dietary diversity and subsequent mortality in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study|last = Kant|first = AK|last2 = Schatzkin|first2 = A|last3 = Harris|first3 = TB|last4 = Ziegler|first4 = RG|last5 = Block|first5 = Gladys|date = March 1, 1993|volume = 57|issue = 3|pages = 434–440|journal = [[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]|pmid = 8382446}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been cited on the subject in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/01/garden/same-old-dinner-same-old-lunch-most-people-like-it-that-way.html?pagewanted=all|title = Same Old Dinner, Same Old Lunch: Most People Like It That Way|last = Hall|first = Trish|date = April 1, 1992|accessdate = October 25, 2016|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noise health effects''' are the physical and psychological [[health]] consequences of regular exposure, to consistent elevated [[Sound exposure level|sound level]]s.  Elevated [[Industrial noise|workplace]] or [[environmental noise]] can cause [[hearing impairment]], [[hypertension]], [[ischemic heart disease]], [[annoyance]], and [[sleep disturbance]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Münzel|first=Thomas|last2=Schmidt|first2=Frank P.|last3=Steven|first3=Sebastian|last4=Herzog|first4=Johannes|last5=Daiber|first5=Andreas|last6=Sørensen|first6=Mette|date=February 2018|title=Environmental Noise and the Cardiovascular System|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0735109717419309|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|volume=71|issue=6|pages=688–697|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2017.12.015|issn=0735-1097|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerns|first=Ellen|last2=Masterson|first2=Elizabeth A.|last3=Themann|first3=Christa L.|last4=Calvert|first4=Geoffrey M.|date=2018-03-14|title=Cardiovascular conditions, hearing difficulty, and occupational noise exposure within US industries and occupations|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/ajim.22833|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|language=en|volume=61|issue=6|pages=477–491|doi=10.1002/ajim.22833|issn=0271-3586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the [[immune system]] and [[birth defect]]s have been also attributed to noise exposure.&lt;ref name="pmid10698728"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Passchier-Vermeer W, Passchier WF | title = Noise exposure and public health | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 108 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 123–31 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10698728 | pmc = 1637786 | doi = 10.2307/3454637 | jstor = 3454637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adverse cardiovascular effects occur from chronic exposure to noise due to the sympathetic nervous system's inability to habituate. The sympathetic nervous system maintains lighter stages of sleep when the body is exposed to noise, which does not allow blood pressure to follow the normal rise and fall cycle of an undisturbed circadian rhythm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Noise induced hearing loss==

{{main|Noise-induced hearing loss}}Noise-induced hearing loss is a permanent shift in pure-tone thresholds, resulting in sensorineural hearing loss. The severity of a threshold shift is dependent on duration and severity of noise exposure. Noise-induced threshold shifts are seen as a notch on an audiogram from 3000–6000&amp;nbsp;Hz, but most often at 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of clinical audiology| last1 = Katz | first1 = Jack | last2 = Chasin | first2 = Marshall | last3 = English | first3 = Kristina M. | last4 = Hood | first4 = Linda J. | last5 = Tillery | first5 = Kim L. | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-1-4511-9163-9 | edition=  Seventh | location = Philadelphia | oclc = 877024342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardiovascular effects==
Noise has been associated with important [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] health problems, particularly hypertension.&lt;ref name="pmid12689488"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ising H, Babisch W, Kruppa B | title = Noise-Induced Endocrine Effects and Cardiovascular Risk | journal = Noise &amp; Health | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 37–48 | year = 1999 | pmid = 12689488 | doi =  | url = http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=1999;volume=1;issue=4;spage=37;epage=48;aulast=Ising }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Hugh|last2=Kamp|first2=Irene Van|date=2012-11-01|title=Noise and cardiovascular disease: A review of the literature 2008-2011|url=http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2012;volume=14;issue=61;spage=287;epage=291;aulast=Davies|journal=Noise and Health|language=en|volume=14|issue=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noise levels of 50&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at night may also increase the risk of [[myocardial infarction]] by chronically elevating [[cortisol]] production.&lt;ref name="pmid12537833"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maschke C | title = Stress Hormone Changes in Persons exposed to Simulated Night Noise | journal = Noise &amp; Health | volume = 5 | issue = 17 | pages = 35–45 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12537833 | doi =  | url = http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2002;volume=5;issue=17;spage=35;epage=45;aulast=Maschke }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Franssen&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franssen EA, van Wiechen CM, Nagelkerke NJ, Lebret E | title = Aircraft noise around a large international airport and its impact on general health and medication use | journal = Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 405–13 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15090660 | pmc = 1740783 | doi = 10.1136/oem.2002.005488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lercher&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lercher P, Hörtnagl J, Kofler WW | title = Work noise annoyance and blood pressure: combined effects with stressful working conditions | journal = International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–8 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8354571 | doi = 10.1007/BF00586054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roadway noise levels are sufficient to constrict arterial blood flow and lead to [[hypertension|elevated blood pressure]]. Vasoconstriction can result from elevated [[adrenaline]] levels or through [[Stress (medicine)|medical stress]] reactions.

== Psychological impacts of noise ==
Causal relationships have been discovered between noise and psychological effects such as annoyance, psychiatric disorders, and effects on psychosocial well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Noise exposure and public health.|last=Passchier-Vermeer, Passchier|pmc=1637786 | pmid=10698728|volume=108 Suppl 1|date=March 2000|journal=Environ.

This was researched in a study where non-professional musicians were found to have loudness addictions more often than non-musician control subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmuziger N, Patscheke J, Stieglitz R, Probst R | title = Is there addiction to loud music?

Psychological health effects from noise include depression and anxiety. Individuals who have hearing loss, including noise induced hearing loss, may have their symptoms alleviated with the use of hearing aids. Individuals who do not seek treatment for their loss are 50% more likely to have depression than their aided peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/hearing-loss.aspx | title = Silently Suffering From Hearing Loss Negatively Affects Quality of Life| publisher =  American Psychological Association | access-date = 2018-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These psychological effects can lead to detriments in physical care in the form of reduced self-care, work-tolerance, and increased isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1307272|title=Environmental Health Perspectives – Environmental Noise Pollution in the United States: Developing an Effective Public Health Response | publisher = National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences | access-date = 2018-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditory stimuli can serve as psychological triggers for individuals with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glad KA, Hafstad GS, Jensen TK, Dyb G | title = A longitudinal study of psychological distress and exposure to trauma reminders after terrorism | journal = Psychological Trauma | volume = 9 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 145–152 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 27831737 | doi = 10.1037/tra0000224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stress ==
Research commissioned by [[Rockwool International|Rockwool]], a multi-national [[Soundproofing|insulation]] manufacturer headquartered in [[Denmark]], reveals that in the UK one third (33%) of victims of domestic disturbances claim loud parties have left them unable to sleep or made them stressed in the last two years. Around one in eleven (9%) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Noisy Neighbours Blight Millions of Lives |newspaper=[[The Daily Express]]|url= http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/94084/How-noisy-neighbours-millions-of-lives}}&lt;/ref&gt; of those affected by domestic disturbances claims it has left them continually disturbed and stressed. More than 1.8 million people claim noisy neighbours have made their life a misery and they cannot enjoy their own homes. The impact of noise on health is potentially a significant problem across the UK given that more than 17.5 million Britons (38%) have been disturbed by the inhabitants of neighbouring properties in the last two years.  For almost one in ten (7%) Britons this is a regular occurrence.&lt;ref name="lauraclout"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/94084/How-noisy-neighbours-millions-of-lives | title = How noisy neighbours millions of lives | first = Laura | last = Clout | name-list-format = vanc | work = Express.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of the problem of noise pollution for public health is reinforced by figures collated by Rockwool from local authority responses to a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOI) request. This research reveals in the period April 2008 - 2009 [[county council|UK councils]] received 315,838 complaints about noise pollution from private residences. This resulted in environmental health officers across the UK serving 8,069 [[noise abatement]] notices, or citations under the terms of the Anti-Social Behaviour (Scotland) Act.&lt;ref name="lauraclout"/&gt;

[[Westminster City Council]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23714071-details/London+is+home+to+the+noisiest+neighbours/article.do|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130114032609/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23714071-details/London+is+home+to+the+noisiest+neighbours/article.do|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-14|title=London is home to the noisiest neighbours|work=The Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; has received more complaints per head of population than any other district in the UK with 9,814 grievances about noise, which equates to 42.32 complaints per thousand residents. Eight of the top 10 councils ranked by complaints per 1,000 residents are located in [[London]].

== Annoyance ==
Sudden Impulse noises are typically perceived as more bothersome than noise from traffic of equal volume.&lt;ref&gt;Miedema and Oudshoorn 2001 cited in {{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/516462|title=Hypertension and exposure to noise near airports|publisher=Medscape}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annoyance effects of noise are minimally affected by demographics, but fear of the noise source and sensitivity to noise both strongly affect the 'annoyance' of a noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miedema HM, Vos H | title = Demographic and attitudinal factors that modify annoyance from transportation noise | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 105 | issue = 6 | pages = 3336–44 | doi = 10.1121/1.424662 | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound levels as low as 40&amp;nbsp;dB(A) can generate noise complaints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gelfand | first = Stanley A | name-list-format = vanc | title = Essentials of Audiology |publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers |location=New York |isbn=1-58890-017-7 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lower threshold for noise producing [[sleep disturbance]] is 45&amp;nbsp;dB(A) or lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Walker | first1 = JR | last2 = Fahy | first2 = Frank | name-list-format = vanc | title = Fundamentals of noise and vibration |publisher = E &amp; FN Spon |location=London |year=1998 |isbn=0-419-22700-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors that affect the 'annoyance level' of sound include beliefs about noise prevention and the importance of the noise source, and annoyance at the cause (i.e. non-noise related factors) of the noise.&lt;ref name="Field1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Field|first=JM|year=1993|title=Effect of personal and situational variables upon noise annoyance in residential areas|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=93|issue=5|pages=2753–63|doi=10.1121/1.405851}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2007-12-13--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the interpretations of the level of annoyance and the relationship between noise levels and resulting health symptoms could be influenced by the quality of interpersonal relationships at the workplace, as well as the stress level generated by the work itself.&lt;ref name="pmid10698728"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Halpern | first = David | name-list-format = vanc | title = Mental health and the built environment: more than bricks and mortar? | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-7484-0235-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for impact on annoyance of long-term noise versus recent changes is equivocal.&lt;ref name = Field1993/&gt;&lt;!-- There must be a more straightforward way to phrase that sentence, I had to read it several times --&gt;

Approximately 35% to 40% of office workers find noise levels from 55 to 60&amp;nbsp;dB(A) extremely irritating.&lt;ref name="pmid10698728" /&gt; The noise standard in Germany for mentally stressful tasks is set at 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stellman | first = Jeanne Mager | name-list-format = vanc | title = Encyclopedia of occupational health and safety | publisher = International Labour Organization | year = 1998 | isbn = 92-2-109203-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, if the noise source is continuous, the threshold level for tolerability among office workers is lower than 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A).&lt;ref name="pmid10698728" /&gt;

==Child physical development==
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] authored a pamphlet in 1978 that suggested a correlation between low-birthweight (using the [[World Health Organization]] definition of less than {{convert|2500|g}} and high sound levels, and also high rates of [[birth defect]]s in places where expectant mothers are exposed to elevated sound levels, such as typical [[airport]] environs. Specific birth abnormalities included [[harelip]], [[cleft palate]], and defects in the [[Vertebral column|spine]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Noise: A Health Problem'' United States [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], Office of Noise Abatement and Control, Washington, D.C. 20460, August, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lester W. Sontag of The Fels Research Institute (as presented in the same EPA study): “There is ample evidence that environment has a role in shaping the physique, behavior, and function of animals, including man, from [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and not merely from [[birth]]. The [[fetus]] is capable of perceiving sounds and responding to them by motor activity and cardiac rate change." The effects of noise exposure are highest when it occurs between 15 and 60 days after conception, a period in which major internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] and the [[central nervous system]] are formed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Later developmental effects occur as vasoconstriction in the mother reduces blood flow and therefore [[oxygen]] and nutrition to the fetus. Low birth weights and noise were also associated with lower levels of certain [[hormone]]s in the mother. These hormones are thought to affect fetal growth and to be good indicators of [[protein]] production. The difference between the hormone levels of pregnant mothers in noisy versus quiet areas increased as birth approached.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In a 2000 publication, a review of studies on birthweight and noise exposure note that while some older studies suggest that when women are exposed to &gt;65&amp;nbsp;dB aircraft noise a small decrease in birthweight occurs, in a more recent study of 200 Taiwanese women including noise dosimetry measurements of individual noise exposure, the authors found no significant association between noise exposure and birth weight after adjusting for relevant confounders, e.g. social class, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, etc.&lt;ref name="pmid10698728"/&gt;

===Cognitive development===

When young children are regularly exposed to levels of noise that interfere with speech, they may develop speech or reading difficulties, because auditory processing functions are compromised. Children continue to develop their speech perception abilities until they reach their teens. Evidence has shown that when children learn in noisier classrooms, they have more difficulties understanding speech than those who learn in quieter settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson PB | title = Sound in the Classroom | journal = ASHRAE Journal | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 22–25 | year = 1959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Cornell University in 1993, children exposed to noise in learning environments experienced trouble with word discrimination, as well as various cognitive developmental delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=Gary W.|last2=Lepore|first2=Stephen J. | name-list-format = vanc | date = 1993 | title = Nonauditory Effects of Noise on Children: A Critical Review | jstor = 41515250 | journal = Children's Environments | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–51 | doi = 10.2307/41515250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wakefield J | title = Learning the Hard Way | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 110 | issue = 6 | date = June 2002 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.110-a298 | pages=a298–a305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the writing learning impairment [[dysgraphia]] is commonly associated with environmental [[stressor]]s in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.brainhe.com/staff/types/dysgraphiastaff.html | title = Dysgraphiastaff | work = Brain.HE | access-date = 2017-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High noise levels have also been known to damage the physical health of small children.  Children from noisy residences often have a heart rate that is significantly higher (by 2 beats/min on average) than those of children from quieter homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belojevic G, Jakovljevic B, Stojanov V, Paunovic K, Ilic J | title = Urban road-traffic noise and blood pressure and heart rate in preschool children | journal = Environment International | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–31 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 17869340 | doi = 10.1016/j.envint.2007.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
{{main|Noise regulation}}

Environmental [[noise regulation]]s usually specify a maximum outdoor noise level of 60 to 65 [[A-weighting|dB(A)]], while occupational safety organizations recommend that the maximum exposure to noise is 40 hours per week at 85 to 90&amp;nbsp;dB(A). For every additional 3&amp;nbsp;dB(A), the maximum exposure time is reduced by a factor 2, e.g. 20 hours per week at 88&amp;nbsp;dB(A). Sometimes, a factor of two per additional 5&amp;nbsp;dB(A) is used, however, these occupational regulations are acknowledged by the health literature as inadequate to protect against [[hearing loss]] and other health effects. In an effort to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, many programs and initiative have been created, like the [[Buy Quiet]] program, which encourages employers to purchase quieter tools and equipment, and the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]], which recognizes organizations with successful hearing loss prevention strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|title=CDC - Buy Quiet - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|work=cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Safe-in-Sound: Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe-in-Sound|publisher=|access-date=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to indoor noise pollution in residences, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has not set any restrictions on limits to the level of noise. Rather, it has provided a list of recommended levels in its ''Model Community Noise Control Ordinance'', which was published in 1975. For instance, the recommended noise level for indoor residences is less than or equal to 45&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Williams | first1 = Luanne Kemp | last2 = Langley | first2 = Rick L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Environmental Health Secrets |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |location=Philadelphia |year=2000 |isbn=1-56053-408-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EPA Identifies Noise Levels Affecting Health and Welfare |date=April 2, 1972 | url=http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/noise/01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noise pollution]] control in residences is not funded by the federal government in part because of the disagreements in establishing causal links between sounds and health risks, since the effect of noise is often psychological and also, because it leaves no singular tangible trace of damage on the human body. For instance, hearing loss could be attributed to a variety of factors including age, rather than solely due to excessive exposure to noise.&lt;ref name="Schmidt_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt CW | title = Noise that annoys: regulating unwanted sound | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 113 | issue = 1 | pages = A42–5 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15631959 | pmc = 1253730 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.113-a42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Staples SL | title = Human response to environmental noise.

==In canines==
While people are often educated on the effects of noise exposure in humans, there are also different noise exposure effects in animals as well. An example of this would be in canines, and the noise exposure levels occurring within kennels.  Canines experience this noise exposure whether it be a long stay at an animal shelter, or a weekend stay at a boarding facility.

Organizations like [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] and [[Occupational safety and health|OSHA]] have different regulations when it comes to the noise exposure levels in industrial workers.  Currently there are no regulations related to the noise exposure in canines even with such damaging effects related to their health.  Health risks dogs are exposed to include ear damage and behavioral changes.

The average noise exposure in a kennel is greater than 100&amp;nbsp;dB SPL.  According to OSHA these levels would yield in the use of hearing protection for the workers of those kennels due to the risk of noise induced hearing loss.  The anatomical structures of the human and canine ear are very similar, so it is thought that these levels will negatively impact the hearing of canines in kennels. The [[Auditory brainstem response|ABR]] can be used to estimate the hearing threshold of canines, and can be used to show either a temporary threshold shift or permanent threshold shift after being exposed to excessive sound levels.&lt;ref name="Scheifele_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheifele P, Martin D, Clark JG, Kemper D, Wells J | title = Effect of kennel noise on hearing in dogs | journal = American Journal of Veterinary Research | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 482–9 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22452494 | doi = 10.2460/ajvr.73.4.482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral effects to excessive noise exposure include hiding, urinating, defecating, panting, pacing, drooling, disregard to commands, trembling, and barking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Noise Phobia in Dog|journal=Veterinary World|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behavioral patterns pose a much greater problem to canines than meets the eye.  All of these behavioral patterns are characteristics that result in a longer stay at the kennels before being adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Protopopova A, Mehrkam LR, Boggess MM, Wynne CD | title = In-kennel behavior predicts length of stay in shelter dogs | journal = PLOS One | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = e114319 | pmid = 25551460 | pmc = 4281133 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0114319 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A longer stay at the shelter results in a longer duration of noise exposure and therefore more likely to show either a temporary or permanent threshold shift in the canine’s hearing.&lt;ref name="Scheifele_2012" /&gt;

These excessive noise levels are not only harming the canines' physical and psychological state, but the workers' and potential adoptive families' physical and psychological state as well.  The workers' psychological state could affect the care provided to the canines.  These loud noise exposures also have the potential to reduce the amount of time that potential adoptive families spend in the facility.  This can result in less dogs being adopted and more time being exposed to excessive sound levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coppola CL, Enns RM, Grandin T | title = Noise in the animal shelter environment: building design and the effects of daily noise exposure | journal = Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | date = 2006-01-01 | pmid = 16649947 | doi = 10.1207/s15327604jaws0901_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce the level of noise exposure poses a little more difficulty because the majority of the noise is coming from the canines (barking), but structural changes can be made to the facilities in order to reduce the noise.  Structural changes could include how many dogs are put in one area, more absorbing material rather than metal cages and cement walls and floors, and possibly in the future use of hearing protection devices ([[Hearing protection|HPD]]) for the canines. All of these structural changes would also benefit the humans involved as well as the use of HPD’s (ear plugs).

'''Husayn Fakhri al-Khalidi''' ({{lang-ar|حسين فخري الخالدي}}, {{transl|ar|''Ḥusayn Fakhri al-Khalidī''}}, 1895 – 6 February 1962) was [[mayor of Jerusalem]] from 1934 to 1937.

On 23 June 1935 Khalidi founded the [[Reform Party (Palestine)|Reform Party]] and was subsequently the party's representative to the [[Arab Higher Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;Military Preparations of the Arab Community in Palestine, 1945-1948: 1945-1948, By Haim Levenberg, Routledge, 1993, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palestinian deportees in Seychelles.jpg|thumb|right|al-Khalidi, seated in front,  together with the four other deportees in Seychelles, 1938.]]

On 1 October 1937, amid the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], the British Mandate administration outlawed the AHC and several Arab political parties and arrested a number of Arab political leaders. The Reform Party was dissolved and Khalidi was one of the leaders arrested.&lt;ref name=survey&gt;''A Survey of Palestine - prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry.''

Khalidi returned to Palestine in 1943 and joined the reformed Arab Higher Committee in 1945, becoming its secretary in 1946. He was a member of the short-lived [[All-Palestine Government]] established under Egypt's patronage in Gaza in September 1948. He published a book of his memoirs in the same year, while exiled in Beirut.&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/specialseries/2013/05/20135612348774619.html] Episode 4&lt;/ref&gt; He prospered under [[Jordan]]ian rule, he was custodian and supervisor of the Haram al-Sharif in 1951, became a cabinet minister (for Foreign Affairs) and briefly [[Prime Minister of Jordan|prime minister]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Palestine: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Founding of the State of Israel, Gudrun Krämer, translated by Graham Harman, Princeton University Press, 2008, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he wrote a book in English entitled ''Arab Exodus'', though it has never been published.&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"/&gt;

The '''Independent Living Fund''' was set up in 1988 to fund support for disabled people with high support needs in the United Kingdom, enabling them to live in the community rather than move into residential care.

It is run  as a [[non-departmental public body]] with an office in [[Nottingham]] and about 120 staff. It provides support to 19,000 disabled people with the highest levels of need at a cost of about £320 million.  It operates as an independent [[discretionary trust]] funded by the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] and is managed by a board of trustees. Its aim is to combat social exclusion on the grounds of disability. The money is generally used to enable disabled people to live in their own homes and to pay for care, and in particular to employ personal assistants. Many of the beneficiaries would otherwise have to move to [[residential care home]]s.

In December 2010 the Government announced the closure of the Fund to new applicants, and in December 2012, following a consultation on the future of the Fund, it was announced that the Fund would be closed permanently from April 2015. The Government claimed that Local Authorities could meet the same outcomes as the ILF and proposed transfer for existing ILF recipients to their Local Authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disability Living Fund closure to go ahead - minister|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26471706|accessdate=16 June 2014|agency=BBC|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014 The [[Court of Appeal]], in the case of ''Bracking and others v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stuart Bracking and others v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2013] EWCA Civ 1345|url=http://www.edf.org.uk/blog/?p=27224#|accessdate=25 June 2014|publisher=Equality and Diversity Forum|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the Department for Work and Pensions' decision to close the Fund was not lawful, overturning the High Court decision of April 2013. It decided that the Department had not complied with the Public Sector Equality Duties imposed by section 149 of the [[Equality Act 2010]].  The Court agreed that documents which the Minister, [[Esther McVey]], had seen in the run up to her decision proved that "the Minister did not receive a sufficient understanding of the true threat to independent living for ILF users posed by the proposal to close the fund".  Lord Justice McCombe said ‘there is simply not the evidence … to demonstrate to the court that a focussed regard was had to the potentially very grave impact upon individuals in this group of disabled persons, within the context of a consideration of the statutory requirements for disabled people as a whole'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DWP's decision to abolish the Independent Living Fund overturned|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=fb37d01b-56cf-4a04-8d8c-f9098b2666dd|accessdate=16 June 2014|publisher=Lexology|date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government has announced that it will not appeal against this decision so the Fund will continue for the time being.  Its future was the subject of a [[Westminster Hall]] debate on 18 June 2014.  The Department has carried out a new equality impact assessment to justify the closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DWP’s decision to abolish the Independent Living Fund overturned thanks to Labour’s Equality Act is ignored.|url=http://kittysjones.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/dwps-decision-to-abolish-the-independent-living-fund-overturned-thanks-to-labours-equality-act/|website=kittysjones|accessdate=16 June 2014|date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary research behind the [[Google Dengue Trend]] is found here.&lt;ref name=pmid21647308&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001206 |pmc=3104029 |title=Using Web Search Query Data to Monitor Dengue Epidemics: A New Model for Neglected Tropical Disease Surveillance |year=2011 |editor1-last=Aksoy |editor1-first=Serap |last1=Chan |first1=Emily H. |last2=Sahai |first2=Vikram |last3=Conrad |first3=Corrie |last4=Brownstein |first4=John S. |journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e1206 |pmid=21647308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flu Detector==
[http://geopatterns.enm.bris.ac.uk/epidemics/ Flu Detector] was developed by [[Vasileios Lampos]] et al. at the [[University of Bristol]]. It is an application of [[Machine Learning]] that firstly uses [[Feature Selection]] to automatically extract flu-related terms from [[Twitter]] content and then uses those terms to compute a flu-score for several UK regions based on geolocated tweets. The primary research behind the Flu Detector is found here;&lt;ref name="lamposTracking2010" /&gt; a generalised scheme able to track other events as well is proposed here.&lt;ref name="lamposNowcasting2011"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lampos, Vasileios, Cristianini, Nello | title=Nowcasting Events from the Social Web with Statistical Learning | journal=ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology | year=2012 | url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2337557 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new, totally revamped (in terms of models and online data) version of the [http://fludetector.cs.ucl.ac.uk/ Flu Detector] has been recently launched.

==Mood of the Nation==
[http://geopatterns.enm.bris.ac.uk/mood/ Mood of the Nation] was developed by [[Vasileios Lampos]] et al. at the [[University of Bristol]]. It performs mood analysis on tweets geo-located in various regions of the United Kingdom computing on a daily basis scores for four types of emotion: anger, fear, joy and sadness.

'''Jonathan Holmes Gruber''' (born September 30, 1965) is an American professor of economics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he has taught since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/gruberj|title= Jonathan Gruber|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= MIT Economics| publisher= |accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the director of the Health Care Program at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], where he is a research associate. An associate editor of both the ''Journal of Public Economics'' and the ''[[Journal of Health Economics]]'', Gruber has been heavily involved in crafting [[public health policy]].

He has been described as a key architect&lt;ref name="everything you wanted to know"&gt;{{cite news |title=Everything you wanted to know about health reform, in one comic book |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-health-reform-in-one-comic-book/2011/10/11/gIQAN4AzcL_blog.html |work=Wonkblog |publisher =The Washington Post |first=Sarah |last=Kliff |date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of both the 2006 [[Massachusetts health care reform]], sometimes referred to as "Romneycare", and the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], sometimes referred to as the "ACA" and "Obamacare". He became the focus of a media and political firestorm in late 2014 when videos surfaced in which he made controversial statements about the legislative process, marketing strategies, and public perception surrounding the passage of the ACA.

==Early life==
Gruber was born on September 30, 1965, the son of Martin Jay Gruber and Ellie Gruber. His father is Professor Emeritus of Finance at the [[New York University Stern School of Business]], having taught there for more than 40 years. Jonathan Gruber was raised in the New York suburb of [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]]. He completed his [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[economics]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1987 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in economics from [[Harvard University]] in 1992, with a thesis titled ''Changes in the Structure of Employer-Provided Health Insurance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1992|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304000122|title=Changes in the structure of employer-provided health insurance|first=Jonathan|last=Gruber|publisher=ProQuest|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic research career==
Gruber began his career as an assistant professor of economics at MIT in 1992.&lt;ref name="economics.mit.edu"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/9877| accessdate=July 25, 2014|title=Gruber MIT bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a research associate at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]].&lt;ref name="economics.mit.edu"/&gt; Gruber's research has focused on public finance and health economics.

==Government work and consulting==
During the 1997–98 academic year, Gruber was on leave as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy at the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].

===Massachusetts health care reform===
From 2003-06 he was one of the architects of [[Massachusetts health care reform]], also known as "Romneycare".&lt;ref name="a thank you"&gt;{{cite news|title=Viewpoint: A thank you to Gov. Mitt Romney for signing Massachusetts' historic health care reform|url=http://www.masslive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/04/viewpoint_a_thank_you_to_gov_m.html|first=Jonathan|last=Gruber|work=[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|The Republican]]|date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 he became an inaugural member of the Health Connector Board, the main implementing body for that effort. The same year, he was named the 19th most powerful person in health care in the United States by ''[[Modern Healthcare]]'' magazine.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

During the 2008 election he was a consultant to the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], [[John Edwards|Edwards]] and [[Barack Obama|Obama]] presidential campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Victoria|last=Groves|url=http://www.leighbureau.com/speakers/JGruber|title=Looking at the National Health Care Debate through a Massachusetts Lens|accessdate=May 5, 2015|date=May 2, 2011|website=[[Harvard Kennedy School]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gruber was ousted from the Massachusetts Health Connector in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Wheaton|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/jonathan-gruber-massachusetts-obamacare-115523.html|title=Jonathan Gruber among 4 ousted from Massachusetts Obamacare board|date=February 25, 2015|work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act===
From 2009-10, Gruber served as a technical consultant to the Obama Administration and worked with both the administration and [[U.S. Congress]] to help craft the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], often referred to as the ACA or "Obamacare". The Act was signed into law in March 2010, and Gruber has been described as an "architect", "writer", and "consultant" of the legislation. He was widely interviewed and quoted during the legislation's roll-out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Catherine|last=Rampell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/business/jonathan-gruber-health-cares-mr-mandate.html?pagewanted=all|title=Academic Built Case for Mandate in Health Care Law|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vermont health care reform===
In 2010 and 2011, Gruber was involved in crafting and advocating for the [[Vermont health care reform|Single-Payer and Unified Health System]] bill in [[Vermont]], which passed in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obamacare Architect To Help Vermont Design Single Payer|url=http://digital.vpr.net/post/obamacare-architect-help-vermont-design-single-payer|first=Peter|last=Hirschfield|work=[[Vermont Public Radio]]|date=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="proposal"&gt;[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/jfo/healthcare/Hsiao%20Proposal%20-%20public.pdf "The Vermont Option: Achieving Affordable Universal Health Care"], William Hsaio, Steven Kappel, Jonathan Gruber, and a team of health policy analysts, June 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill established Green Mountain Care, which aimed to be the first-ever state-level [[single-payer health care]] system in the United States by the time it was to have kicked in fully in 2017. Green Mountain Care was cancelled in December 2014 by Governor [[Peter Shumlin]] saying its projected costs were becoming too high.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/governor-abandons-single-payer-health-care-plan-225042240.html "Governor abandons single-payer health care plan"], yahoo.com, December 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Gruber has published more than 140 research articles (the majority of which were for NBER) and has edited six research volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nber.org/authors/jonathan_gruber|author=Jonathan Gruber|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|title=NBER Working Papers by Jonathan Gruber|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a co-editor of the ''Journal of Public Economics'', an associate editor of the ''Journal of Health Economics'', and the author of ''Public Finance and Public Policy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bcs.worthpublishers.com/gruber3e/#t_544924____|title=Worth Publishers Student Center for Public Finance and Policy|publisher=Bcs.worthpublishers.com|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he wrote ''Health Care Reform: What It Is, Why It's Necessary, How It Works'', delineating the Affordable Care Act, and illustrated by Nathan Schreiber.&lt;ref name="everything you wanted to know"/&gt;

Gruber's published works include:
* In 1999, the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' published "Abortion legalization and child living circumstances: who is the 'marginal child'?"&lt;ref name="QJE2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gruber |first=J. |last2=Levine |first2=P. |last3=Staiger |first3=D. |title=Abortion Legalization and Child Living Circumstances: Who is the "Marginal Child"? |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |year=1999 |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=263–91 |doi=10.1162/003355399556007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that the legalized abortion has a selective effect for reducing the birth of "marginal children" that saved the government over $14 billion in welfare payments through 1994.
* Writing for the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] in 2002, Gruber worked together with [[Sendhil Mullainathan]] on a paper titled “Do [[Cigarette taxes in the United States|Cigarette Taxes]] Make Smokers Happier", which did find an improvement in smokers’ psychological state because higher taxes were a disincentive to smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mullainathan|first1=Sendhil|last2=Gruber|first2=Jonathan |title=Do Cigarette Taxes Make Smokers Happier? |work=NBER Working Paper No. 8872 |date=April 2002 |doi=10.3386/w8872 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 15, 2006, the [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] published an article by Gruber entitled "The Cost and Coverage Impact of the President's Health Insurance Budget Proposals"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbpp.org/2-15-06health.htm|journal=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|title=The Cost and Coverage Impact of The President's Health Insurance Budget Proposals|date=February 15, 2006|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a December 4, 2008, ''[[New York Times]]'' op-ed, "Medicine for the Job Market", he claimed that expanding health insurance, even in difficult financial times would stimulate the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gruber|first=Jonathan|date=December 4, 2008|title=Medicine for the Job Market|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/opinion/04gruber.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an article for the National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation in April 2010, "Taxing Sin to Modify Behavior and Raise Revenue", Gruber advocated a sort of "[[sin tax]]" for the obese. He uses the model of [[Cigarette taxes in the United States|cigarette taxes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nihcm.org/pdf/ExpertVoices_Gruber_April2010.pdf|title=Taxing Sin to Modify Behavior and Raise Revenue|date=April 2010|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 9, 2011, the [[Center for American Progress]] published an article by Gruber titled "Health Care Reform Without the Individual Mandate", analyzing the health insurance coverage impacts of alternative policy options for encouraging purchase of health insurance under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], including the mandate, a late penalty, and automatic enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/02/gruber_mandate.html|last=Gruber|first=Jonathan|date=February 9, 2011|title=Health Care Reform Without the Individual Mandate|work=American Progress|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2006, Gruber received the American Society of Health Economists Inaugural Medal for the best health economist in the nation aged 40 and under.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web.mit.edu/shass/soundings/issue_06f/honors.html|title=Honors &amp; awards – Fall 2006 Soundings|publisher=Web.mit.edu|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a member of the [[Institute of Medicine]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nasi.org/about/spotlight/jonathan-gruber|title=National Academy of Social Insurance|publisher=National Academy of Social Insurance|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he was elected to the Executive Committee of the [[American Economic Association]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 2011 he was named “One of the Top 25 Most Innovative and Practical Thinkers of Our Time” by ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' Magazine. In both 2006 and 2012 he was rated as one of the top 100 most powerful people in health care in the United States by ''Modern Healthcare'' Magazine.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Controversies==
===Non-disclosure of HHS contract===
In January 2010, after news emerged that Gruber was under a $297,000 contract with the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], while at the same time promoting the [[Obama administration]]'s [[health care reform]] policies, some commentators suggested a [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/01/08/economist-contract-health-department-touting-reform|title=Economist Was Under Contract With HHS While Touting Health Reform Bill| work=Fox News|date=January 8, 2010|accessdate=November 15, 2013|author=Berger, Judson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ronald|last=Brownstein|date=January 8, 2010|title=On Jonathan Gruber's Conflict Of Interest|website=[[The Atlantic]]|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/01/on-jonathan-grubers-conflict-of-interest/33215}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Krugman|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/jonathan-gruber|title=Jonathan Gruber|work=New York Times|date=January 11, 2010|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that, although Gruber didn't always disclose his HHS connections, the times when he didn't were no big deal. In response to Krugman's contention, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'''s [[Glenn Greenwald]] wrote, "What will make it impossible to effectively call out wrongdoing by future corrupt administrations (by which Krugman seems to mean: Republican administrations) is the willingness of some people to tolerate and defend corruption when done by 'their side.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Glenn|last=Greenwald|url= http://www.salon.com/2010/01/16/krugman_5|title=Krugman, Gruber and non-disclosure issues|publisher=Salon Media Group|date=January 16, 2010|accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description of ACA subsidies===
One heavily scrutinized part of the ACA reads that subsidies should be given to healthcare recipients who are enrolled "through an Exchange established by the State". Some have read this to mean that subsidies can be given only in states that have chosen to create their own healthcare exchanges, and do not use the federal exchange, while the Obama administration says that the wording applies to all states. This dispute was part of a series of lawsuits referred to collectively as ''[[King v. Burwell]]''. In July 2014, two separate recordings of Gruber, both from January 2012, surfaced in which he seemed to contradict the administration's position. In one, Gruber states, in response to an audience question, that "if you’re a state and you don’t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don't get their [[tax credits]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Radia|first=Ryan|title=Obamacare Architect Admitted in 2012 States without Exchanges Lose Subsidies|date=July 24, 2014|url=https://cei.org/blog/obamacare-architect-admitted-2012-states-without-exchanges-lose-subsidies|website=[[Competitive Enterprise Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the other he says, "if your governor doesn't set up an exchange, you're losing hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits to be delivered to your citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Serwer|first=Adam|title=Adviser's past remarks could give Obamacare a headache|date=July 26, 2014|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jonathan-gruber-video-obamacare#53439|website=msnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these recordings emerged, Gruber called these statements mistaken, describing them as "just a speak-o—you know, like a typo".&lt;ref name="just a mistake"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jonathan Gruber: 'It Was Just a Mistake'|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118851/jonathan-gruber-halbig-says-quote-exchanges-was-mistake|work=The New Republic|first=Jonathan|last=Cohn|date=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Grubergate" videos controversy===
In November 2014, a series of videos emerged of Gruber speaking about the ACA at different events, from 2010 to 2013, in ways that proved to be controversial; the controversy became known in the press as "Grubergate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Grubergate' shows the sad state of debate on Obamacare|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-skocpol-obamacare-gruber-20141210-story.html|first=Theda|last=Skocpol|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first, most widely publicized video, taken at a panel discussion about the ACA at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in October 2013, Gruber said the bill was deliberately written "in a tortured way" to disguise the fact that it creates a system by which "healthy people pay in and sick people get money". He said this obfuscation was needed due to "the stupidity of the American voter" in ensuring the bill's passage. Gruber said the bill's inherent "lack of transparency is a huge political advantage" in selling it.&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G790p0LcgbI|title=GRUBER: "Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage"|publisher=American Commitment|date=October 13, 2013|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comments caused significant controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kathleen|last=Parker|date=November 12, 2014|title=Obama and the 'Stupidity of the American Voter|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=November 12, 2014|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-barack-obama-affordable-care-act-stupidity-perspec-1113-jm-20141112-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ACA Architect: 'The Stupidity Of The American Voter' Led Us To Hide Obamacare's True Costs From The Public |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/11/10/aca-architect-the-stupidity-of-the-american-voter-led-us-to-hide-obamacares-tax-hikes-and-subsidies-from-the-public|work=Forbes|first=Avik|last=Roy|date=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jose A.|last=DelReal|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/11/11/obamacare-consultant-under-fire-for-stupidity-of-the-american-voter-comment|title=Obamacare consultant under fire for 'stupidity of the American voter' comment|work=Washington Post|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two subsequent videos, Gruber was shown talking about the decision (which he attributed to [[John Kerry]]) to have the bill tax insurance companies instead of patients (the so-called "Cadillac tax"), which he called fundamentally the same thing economically but more palatable politically. In one video, he stated that "the American people are too stupid to understand the difference" between the two approaches, while in the other he said that the switch worked due to "the lack of economic understanding of the American voter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obamacare: Voters, are you stupid?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/14/politics/obamacare-voters-stupid-explainer|work=[[CNN]]|first=Jeremy|last=Diamond|date=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another video, taken in 2010, Gruber expressed doubts that the ACA would significantly reduce health care costs, although he noted that lowering costs played a major part in the way the legislation had been promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obamacare architect discussed misleading public in 4th newly uncovered video|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/13/politics/tapper-gruber|work=CNN|first=Jake|last=Tapper|date=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another video, taken in 2011, Gruber again talks about manipulation behind the "Cadillac tax", this time also stating that the tax is designed so that, though it begins by affecting only 8% of insurance plans, it will "over the next 20 years" come to apply to nearly all employer-provided health plans.&lt;ref name="obama promised"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama promised Obamacare wouldn't do exactly what Gruber says it will do|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/18/politics/gruber-obamacare-promises|work=[[CNN]]|first=Jake|last=Tapper|date=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Jake Tapper]] noted that Gruber's description of the "Cadillac tax" directly contradicted a promise that Obama had made before the bill was passed.&lt;ref name="obama promised"/&gt;

After the first of these videos came out, Gruber apologized and conceded he "spoke inappropriately".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jonathan Gruber to MSNBC: My 'Stupidity of the American Voter' Remark was Inappropriate|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jonathan-gruber-to-msnbc-my-stupidity-of-the-american-voter-remark-was-inappropriate|work=Mediaite|first=Eddie|last=Scarry|date=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some defenders of the ACA, such as [[Jonathan Cohn]], called Gruber's statements about Americans "wrong and inappropriate" while maintaining that the trickery of which Gruber spoke was standard procedure in passing legislation in Washington, D.C., and thus not a cause for scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Jon Gruber's Quotes Really Tell Us About Obamacare—and American Politics|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/120311/jonathan-gruber-and-obamacare-what-his-quotes-really-tell-us|first=Jonathan|last=Cohn|work=The New Republic|date=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Obamacare Debate Was One of the Most Transparent in Recent Memory|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/120251/jonathan-gruber-obamacare-comments-get-aca-history-wrong|first=Brian|last=Beutler|work= [[The New Republic]]|date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the Act, on the other hand, were harsher in their criticism: ''[[National Review|National Review Online]]'' editor and conservative commentator [[Rich Lowry]] said the videos were emblematic of "the progressive mind, which values complexity over simplicity, favors indirect taxes and impositions on the American public so their costs can be hidden, and has a dim view of the average American",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thank You, Jonathan Gruber|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/392672/thank-you-jonathan-gruber-rich-lowry|work=National Review|first=Rich|last=Lowry|date=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while commentator [[Charles Krauthammer]] called the first video "the ultimate vindication of the charge that Obamacare was sold on a pack of lies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Gruber Confession|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/392644/gruber-confession-charles-krauthammer|work=National Review|first=Charles|last=Krauthammer|date=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative [[S.E. Cupp]] wrote that the videos showed "willful ignorance" on Gruber's part in thinking that the Act was successfully marketed to voters, stating that "the law has never cracked a 51% favorability rating" and that, in the [[United States elections, 2010|first elections after the ACA passed]], Republicans, who had opposed it, retook the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and gained control of 11 additional state governorships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The guy who thinks voters are 'stupid'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/13/opinion/cupp-gruber-obamacare|first=S.E.|last=Cupp|work=CNN|date=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Pelosi]], then-Speaker of the House, who successfully shepherded the legislation through the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], without a single GOP vote and despite some opposition from pro-life Democrats, stated in a press conference after the Gruber controversy, ''"So I don't know who he is. He didn't help write our bill"'', a comment [[PolitiFact]] described as "inaccurate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/13/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-she-doesnt-know-who-jonathan-gru |title=Nancy Pelosi says she doesn't know who Jonathan Gruber is |website=PolitiFact.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martosko |first=David |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2833632/Pelosi-disowns-Obamacare-architect-Jonathan-Gruber-stupidity-American-voter-video.html |title=Nancy Pelosi disowns Obamacare 'architect' Jonathan Gruber over video |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2014-11-13 |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Congressional hearing====
In the wake of the controversy, Jonathan Gruber was called to testify before members of [[United States Congress]]. He gave testimony on December 9, 2014, in which he apologized for his remarks, which he called "glib, thoughtless, and sometimes downright insulting".&lt;ref name=GruberTestimonyGowdyQuestion&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Gruber, Jonathan| date=9 December 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnXzJm1sJRM| title=Rep.

====Effect on Vermont single-payer plan====
On December 17, 2014, [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont Governor]] [[Peter Shumlin]] cancelled the [[Vermont health care reform]] plan, on which Gruber had served as a consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vermont bails on single-payer health care|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/vermont-peter-shumlin-single-payer-health-care-113653.html|first=Sarah|last=Wheaton|work=Politico|date=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although budgetary concerns were cited as the reason for the cancellation, some called Gruber's involvement with the plan a factor as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How Math, Lawsuits, and Jonathan Gruber Killed Vermont's Single-Payer Health Care Dream|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-18/how-math-lawsuits-and-jonathan-gruber-killed-vermonts-singlepayer-health-care-dream|first=David|last=Weigel|work=Bloomberg|date=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vermont Public Radio|VPR]], Vermont state auditor Doug Hoffer is auditing Gruber's contracts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Auditor: Invoices unsupported from Vt.health "expert"|url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/23/vt-deal-health-expert-gruber-scrutiny/22222125|first=Dave|last=Gram|work=[[Burlington Free Press]]|date=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Vermont health care reform]], which Gruber "helped Vermont design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State's Contract With Economist Jonathan Gruber Under Scrutiny|url=http://digital.vpr.net/post/states-contract-economist-jonathan-gruber-under-scrutiny|first=Peter|last=Hirschfeld|work=VPR|date=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extent of contributions===
The extent of Gruber's contributions to both Massachusetts and federal health care reform has been the source of significant controversy. In 2014, the Obama administration claimed that Gruber did not have a major role in creating the ACA.&lt;ref name="SArmourWSJ06212015"&gt;{{cite news|last=Armour|first=Stephanie|date=June 21, 2015|title=MIT Economist Jonathan Gruber Had Bigger Role in Health Law, Emails Show|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mit-economist-jonathan-gruber-had-bigger-role-in-health-law-emails-show-1434910195?KEYWORDS=Jonathan+Gruber|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|accessdate=June 22, 2015|quote=Jonathan Gruber, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist whose comments about the health-care law touched off a political furor, worked more closely than previously known with the White House and top federal officials to shape the law, previously unreleased emails show.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to emails released by the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|U.S. House Oversight Committee]] to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', Gruber met and consulted with various Obama administration officials in charge of writing and developing the law,&lt;ref name="SArmourWSJ06212015"/&gt; including [[Peter R. Orszag|Peter Orszag]], who was director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB), [[Jason Furman]], an economic adviser to the president, [[Ezekiel Emanuel]], who was then a special adviser for health policy at OMB, [[Jeanne Lambrew]], a top Obama administration health adviser who worked at HHS and the White House, and [[Lawrence Summers]], then a top economic adviser in the administration.&lt;ref name="SArmourWSJ06212015"/&gt; In July 2009, he was invited to meet personally with Obama.&lt;ref name="SArmourWSJ06212015"/&gt;

During his December 2014 congressional hearing, in both his written and oral testimony,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Written Testimony of Professor Jonathan Gruber before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, U.S. House of Representatives|url=http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Gruber-Statement-12-9-ObamaCare1.pdf|work=United States Congress|date=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gruber downplayed his own influence on the Massachusetts and national health care plans, stating: "I did not draft Governor Romney’s health care plan, and I was not the 'architect' of President Obama’s health care plan." The newspaper ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' called this a contradiction of various statements that Gruber had previously made, claiming that at "numerous speeches, lectures and TV interviews in the past four years, Gruber has been introduced as the 'architect' of the Massachusetts law and/or Obamacare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gruber on ObamaCare: 'I helped write it'|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/226626-jonathan-gruber-on-obamacare-i-helped-write-it|first=Jesse|last=Byrnes|work=The Hill|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lactivism''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "[[lactation]]" and "[[activism]]") is the doctrine or practice of vigorous action or involvement as a means of achieving a breastfeeding culture, sometimes by demonstrations, protests, etc. of [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name="Harmon" /&gt; Supporters, referred to as "'''lactivists'''", seek to protest the violation of International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes by formula companies and industry. 

One form that lactivism takes is the staging of a "nurse-in" (a play on "[[sit-in]]"), which involves women gathering in public to nurse their children, usually to protest incidents in which a nursing mother was asked to cover up or leave a location because she was nursing.&lt;ref name="MSNBC November 16, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS News September 8, 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today November 20, 2006" /&gt;

During nurse-ins, nursing mothers often wear clothing with the [[International Breastfeeding Symbol]] on it, to show their solidarity.&lt;ref name="mothering" /&gt;

Another form of lactivism is acting as support for mothers that wish to nurse. Lactivists provide information and share resources on successful nursing.

Many lactivists choose to breastfeed their children over bottle feeding, seeing this as the natural way to provide nutrition. It is claimed that breastfeeding provides a bonding experience superior to that or bottle feeding. Lactivists may also argue that bottle feeding is costlier than breastfeeding as it requires a multitude of items, and the money saved from breastfeeding can be spent on other useful items for the child. Multiple health organizations recommend breast milk as the primary source of nutrition for babies, including the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the [[American Medical Association]], and the [[World Health Organization]].

[[File:2011 Everybody Walk Week 5903 (6172210942).jpg|thumb|"Everybody Walk Week" at [[Iverson Mall]], Washington DC]]
'''Mall walking''' is a form of [[exercise]] in which people walk or jog through the usually long corridors of [[shopping mall]]s. Many malls open early so that people may mall walk; stores and other such facilities generally do not open at this time, though [[vending machine]] concessions are available. Many choose to mall walk as the indoor climate is comfortable and there is easy access to amenities, such as benches, [[toilet]]s, and [[water fountain]]s. Clean and level surfaces also provide a safe walking environment.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/mall-stars/406192/ |title=Mall Walkers: The Suburban Exercisers Keeping America Wholesome |last1=Perry |first1=Georgia |date=2015-09-21 |website=[[The Atlantic]] |access-date=2015-09-21 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mall walking is undertaken individually, in groups, or as part of an organized mall walking program.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite report|author1=Belza B|author2=Allen P|author3=Brown DR|author4=Farren L|author5=Janicek S|author6=Jones DL|author7=King DK|author8=Marquez DX|author9=Miyawaki CE|author10=Rosenberg D|date=2015|title=Mall walking: A program resource guide.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/downloads/mallwalking-guide.pdf|publisher=University of Washington Health Promotion Research Center|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mall walking in the United States is especially popular amongst senior citizens. Many mall walkers cite the camaraderie of walking in groups.&lt;ref name=Atlantic /&gt;

== Advantages to mall owners ==

Many malls actively encourage mall walking with special clubs and benefits. It is seen by the mall owners as beneficial for several reasons:
* After walking, mall walkers may well stay on and shop the stores or patronize the mall's [[food court]], increasing the traffic in the mall during what would otherwise be the very slow opening hour.
* Mall-walking programs provide good, often free, publicity for the mall owners.

== Disadvantages to mall owners ==

Despite the advantages that mall walking provides those that partake in the activity and the advantages they perceive mall owners receiving, there are some burdens placed upon mall owners:
* Mall walkers arrive and participate at a time when the mall would otherwise not be open, requiring the on-site security staff to turn their attention away from other procedures to supervise and attend to this crowd.
* The [[impromptu]] timing of mall walking during the early hours of the morning also interferes with the housekeeping staff's ability to clean as they must avoid walkers during a time they would otherwise have free range.

'''NCLEX''' (National Council Licensure Examination) is a nationwide examination for the [[nurse licensure|licensing of nurses]] in the United States and Canada since 1994 and 2015, respectively.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncsbn.org/70.htm|title=NCSBN Historical Timeline|work=[[National Council of State Boards of Nursing]]|year=2015|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=canada /&gt; There are two types, the NCLEX-RN and the NCLEX-PN. After graduation from a school of nursing, one takes the NCLEX exam to receive his or her nursing license. A nursing license gives an individual the permission to practice nursing, granted by the state where he or she met the requirements.

NCLEX examinations are developed and owned by the [[National Council of State Boards of Nursing|National Council of State Boards of Nursing, Inc.]] (NCSBN). The NCSBN administers these examinations on behalf of its member boards which consist of the boards of nursing in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories, [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and the [[Virgin Islands]].

To ensure public protection, each board of nursing requires a candidate for licensure to pass the appropriate NCLEX examination, NCLEX-RN for [[registered nurses]] and the NCLEX-PN for vocational or [[practical nurse]]s. NCLEX examinations are designed to test the knowledge, skills and abilities essential for the safe and effective practice of nursing at the entry-level.

NCLEX examinations are provided in a [[computerized adaptive testing]] (CAT) format and are presently administered by Pearson VUE in their network of Pearson Professional Centers (PPC). With computerized exams such as this, the computer selects which question you are asked based on how you answered the previous question.  The NCLEX covers a wide range of material.  The individual will be scored by their ability to think critically about decisions involving nursing care.&lt;ref name= now&gt;Catalano, Joseph T. Nursing Now: Today's Issues, Tomorrow's Trends. 6th ed. Philadelphia, PA: F.A. Davis, 2012. Print. pg. 209-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in the exam==

The governing body responsible for making changes to the NCLEX is the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, the NCSBN.  They make changes by analyzing the current nursing practices.  They do this by surveying  approximately 12,000 recently licensed nurses about different nursing activities which appear on the NCLEX.  The NCSBN analyzes these nursing activities based on how frequent the activity may occur, how it could impact the client’s safety, and the location of these activities.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;  The NCSBN conducts these analyses every three years, then makes any needed changes to the exam. Changes were made in 2013 and are expected every three years after that date.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

In 2015, NCLEX was adopted in Canada, with changes made to address measuring units, drug names, and other terminology differences between the United States and Canada. Additionally, the NCLEX is available in [[Canadian French]] for [[French language in Canada|French-speaking Canadians]].&lt;ref name=canada&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncsbn.org/4702.htm|title=Canadian Educators &amp; Students FAQs|work=[[National Council of State Boards of Nursing]]|year=2015|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of examination==
===NCLEX-RN===
'''NCLEX-RN''' (National Council Licensure Examination-Registered Nurse). All [[board of nursing|boards of nursing]] in states and territories of the United States require candidates to pass this exam for [[Nursing license|licensure]] as a [[registered nurse]] (RN). As of 2015, 10 provincial/territorial RN regulators in Canada have chosen the NCLEX-RN and the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) as the provider of the Canadian RN entry-to-practice exam.&lt;ref name=CNA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cna-aiic.ca/en/becoming-an-rn/rn-exam|title=RN Exam|website=Cna-aiic.ca|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCLEX-RN uses the five-step nursing process.  Each of the questions will fall into one of the five steps: assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

===NCLEX-PN===
'''NCLEX-PN''' (National Council Licensure Examination-Practical Nurse). All US state and territorial [[board of nursing|boards of nursing]] require a passing result on the exam for [[licensure]] as a [[licensed practical nurse]] (LPN) or [[Licensed Practical Nurse|licensed vocational nurse]] (LVN).

== Exam content ==
The majority of test items are written at the [[cognition]] level of application or higher, but the exam may include items at all cognitive levels.  Examples of cognitive level are memorization or recall, knowledge, analysis and application.

===NCLEX-PN===
The exam's content is based on client needs:  
* Safe Effective Care Environment
** Management of Care
** Safety and [[Infection control|Infection Control]]
* Health Promotion and Maintenance
* Psychosocial Integrity
* Physiological Integrity
** Basic Care and Comfort
** Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies
** Reduction of Risk Potential
** Physiological Adaptation

===NCLEX-RN===
The exam's content is based on client needs:
* Safe and Effective Care Environment
** Management of Care 17-23%
** Safety and Infection Control 9-15%
* Health Promotion and Maintenance 6-12%
* Psychosocial Integrity 6-12%
* Physiological Integrity
** Basic Care and Comfort 6-12%
** Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies
** Reduction of Risk Potential 9-15%
** Physiological Adaptation 11-17%&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

===Physiological Integrity===
The Physiological Integrity category contains the majority of the questions on the exam, about 43-67 percent. This portion of the NCLEX deals with adult medical and surgical care, [[pediatrics]], and [[gerontology]], which is the study of the elderly and the effects of aging. Some of the questions may deal with conditions that nurses treat on a regular basis such as, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, neurological disorders, renal diseases, and respiratory diseases. In addition, questions on traumatic injuries, immunological disorders, skin disorders and infectious diseases could be asked. There are different topics on the NCLEX pertaining to the pediatric client.  These topics may include growth and development, birth abnormalities, child abuse, common infectious diseases of children, and usual childhood traumas such as burn injuries and fractures.&lt;ref name= now/&gt;

===Safe and Effective Care Environment===
This category makes up approximately 21-33 percent of the NCLEX questions.  Questions in this category cover safety issues in patient care, particularly the administration of medicine to patients, safety measures to prevent further injuries and infections, isolation precautions, safety for pediatric patients, and special safety precautions for patients with psychiatric problems.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

This portion of the exam may also include questions pertaining to laboratory tests, test results, and unique nursing procedures that may be associated with test results; ethical and legal nursing problems; nursing management; and issues related to giving patients the best care.  NCLEX questions on these topics are randomly spread throughout the exam.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

===Health Promotion and Maintenance===
The Health Promotion and Maintenance category makes up about 12 percent of the NCLEX examination. Questions under this category deal with birth control measures, pregnancy, labor and delivery; care for a newborn infant, growth and development, and diseases that can spread easily like sexually transmitted infections.  If a patient is pregnant, it is very important that the nurse be able to act as a teacher or counselor for the patient.  This makes it necessary to understand all components of a patient’s pregnancy.  Knowledge of a proper diet, development of the fetus, signs and symptoms of pregnancy complications and certain pregnancy related procedures will be helpful for this section of the exam.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

===Psychosocial Integrity===
Like the section on Health Promotion and Maintenance, the Psychosocial Integrity category constitutes approximately 12 percent of  the NCLEX questions.  Questions in this category pertain to patients with psychiatric problems and their unique issues.  In addition, this material may cover coping mechanisms for different situations. Other situations covered in this section are about psychosocial problems that fall short of psychiatric illness. Questions could cover information on the following disorders:  depression, [[schizophrenia]], [[organic mental disorders]], eating disorders, personality disorders, and anxiety disorders.  Also included in this section may be questions about crisis intervention, substance abuse, and therapy through communication.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

==Question types==
Most of the questions of the NCLEX exam are worded [[multiple choice]] questions. In recent years, however, the NCSBN has added ''new format questions'' which do not involve simple multiple choice selection. Examples of the new formats include identifying and selecting a particular area of a drawn body part; selecting multiple correct answers via check boxes; free response mathematical questions usually involving medication calculations; and ordering the steps of a medical or nursing procedure.

Questions on the NCLEX exam are of three different types or levels: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.  Level 1 questions are the most basic questions and make up less than 10 percent of the total questions.  Level 1 questions test the individual’s knowledge and understanding.  These questions require the individual to recall specific facts and information.  Level 2 questions require an additional level of thinking  in order to answer the question.  In these types of questions, the individual will be required to know specific information and then use it to interpret or analyze the question.  Level 2 questions are analysis and application type questions.  Level 3 questions are the most complex type of question on the NCLEX.  These questions require the individual to judge, evaluate, and combine information.  The individual will have to apply the rules, facts, and processes they know and then make decisions about what is best for the patient’s care based on the situation.  What makes level 3 questions difficult is the likely existence of more than one correct answer forcing the individual  to decide which answer is the best choice.  Level 2 and Level 3 questions make up about 95 percent of the questions on the NCLEX exam. However, it is possible for the exam to have no Level 1 question.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

==Format==
The NCLEX exam is taken on a computer at a Pearson Professional Center.&lt;ref name=now/&gt; Pearson Professional Centers are testing centers for certifications and licenses all over the world.  There are numerous testing centers in each state of the U.S. and centers can be found in 175 countries.&lt;ref&gt;"Locate a Test Center." Locate a Test Center. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The NCLEX exam is at least 90 percent multiple-choice questions. The remaining questions require an individual to fill in the blank, choose all of the correct answers from a list of options, put a number of steps in the correct sequence, or identify a correct area on a picture.  Some of these alternative format questions ask information about a chart, graph, or audio clip. The questions can also use pictures as the answer choices instead of words.  Each question will appear one at a time on a computer screen.  Questions will not be repeated; however, questions based on a similar situation could be asked.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

Each individual will take a different form of the exam.  Since each question depends on how the previous question is answered, an individual can be given between 75 and 265 questions.  Only 60 out of the first 75 questions on the exam will count.  The 15 that do not count are “trial” questions, and these will be used on future examinations.  The  “trial” questions are not identified as such, therefore, it is best to answer every question.  If the individual continues to get questions from the same category, it could mean that the NCSBN is testing those types of questions, or it could mean that the individual keeps getting those types of questions incorrect.  The computer will continue to randomly generate questions from that category until the individual has met the requirements of the test plan.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

Each individual will have a maximum of six hours to complete the exam but there is no minimum time limit. There is a mandatory 10-minute break about 2 ½ hours after the start of the exam and another optional break after about 4 hours of testing.  It is acceptable to take breaks any time during the exam, however, test-takers will lose the additional break time from the total test time.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

A certain number of correctly answered questions is not required to pass the exam.  An individual’ s score will not be compared to other scores to determine if he or she passes.  The NCLEX is graded by comparing the responses to a pre-established standard.  Those individuals who meet or exceed the standard pass the exam, those who do not fail.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3115">{{Primary sources|article|date=May 2011}}The '''National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey''' ('''NHANES''') is a [[Statistical survey|survey]] [[research]] program conducted by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] (NCHS) to assess the [[health]] and [[nutrition]]al status of adults and children in the [[United States]], and to track changes over time. The survey combines [[interview]]s, [[physical examination]]s and laboratory tests. 

The NHANES interview includes [[Demographics|demographic]], [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]], [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]], and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, [[Dentistry|dental]], and [[Physiology|physiological]] measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by medical personnel.

The very first NHANES was conducted in 1971, and in 1999 the surveys became an annual event; the first report on the topic was published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Biomonitoring | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] | publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | author=Ozonoff, David | editor=Rogers, Kara | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHANES findings are used to determine the prevalence of major diseases and [[risk factor]]s for diseases. Information is used to assess nutritional status and its association with [[health promotion]] and [[disease prevention]]. NHANES findings are also the basis for national standards for such measurements as [[Human height|height]], [[Body weight|weight]], and [[blood pressure]]. NHANES data from are used in [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies and [[health science]]s research, which help develop sound public [[health policy]], direct and design health programs and services, and expand health knowledge.

"'''New Earth'''" is the first episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|second series]] of the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 15 April 2006.

The episode is set five billion years in the future on the planet New Earth, a planet humanity settled on following the destruction of the [[Earth]] in the 2005 episode "[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]". In the episode, the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[Tenth Doctor]] ([[David Tennant]]), his travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), and their old enemy [[List of Doctor Who villains#Lady Cassandra|Lady Cassandra]] ([[Zoë Wanamaker]]) uncover many artificially-grown humans having been infected with every disease in a hospital by a group of humanoid cat nuns as a way of finding cures for the diseases.

==Plot==
The [[Tenth Doctor]] takes [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] to the farthest point he's ever taken her, to the year 5,000,000,023, in the [[Messier 87|M87 galaxy]]. After [[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|the destruction of the Earth]], humanity settled onto a world they named "New Earth". The Doctor is summoned to Ward 26 in a hospital in New New York through his [[List of Doctor Who items#P|psychic paper]]. In the Ward, the Doctor meets several humanoid feline nuns of the [[List of Doctor Who villains#Sisters of Plenitude|Sisters of Plenitude]] who are overseeing the patients. The patients catch the attention of the Doctor because they all have incurable maladies but are somehow being cured by the Sisters. The Doctor recognises the [[Face of Boe]], who sent the message the Doctor received. Meanwhile, Rose is separated from the Doctor and brought to the basement, where she is escorted by [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Chip|Chip]] to meet [[List_of_Doctor_Who_villains#Lady_Cassandra|Lady Cassandra]]. Chip has been using the hospital facility to care for Cassandra, but she is suspicious of the methods used in the hospital and needs Rose's help to investigate.  Rose is tricked into stepping into a psychograft, a machine that allows Cassandra to implant her mind into Rose's body possessing her. Examining her new appearance, Cassandra is initially disgusted by Rose's "[[Chav]]" outfit but soon decides she is attractive enough. She is able to access Rose's thoughts and learns of the Doctor's new form.
[[File:Cat nurse from Doctor Who (529565812).jpg|thumb|left|The Sisters of Plenitude as shown at the Doctor Who Experience.]]
The Doctor is suspicious of Cassandra/Rose's actions after she kisses him and displays knowledge of advanced computer systems. He and Cassandra/Rose discover that the hospital houses thousands of pods containing artificially grown humans in what is supposedly the hospital's intensive care unit. The artificial humans are forcibly infected with every disease in the galaxy so that the Sisters can discover the cures. The Doctor confronts the Sisters over their atrocity, and they insist it was necessary to deal with the influx of settlers and the diseases they brought with them. They also insist that they are simply flesh due to their origins, without any actual life. The Doctor believes that Rose's current actions are a result of being a test subject and orders her affliction to be reversed, but Cassandra/Rose uses a perfume gas hidden in her cleavage to knock the Doctor out, locking him in a pod. Cassandra/Rose then approaches the head Sister and demands payment in exchange for keeping the human test subjects secret. The Sisters refuse, and Cassandra/Rose releases the Doctor and some of the humans as a distraction. The infected humans release others from their pods and soon a [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]]-like attack begins, with those infected trying to attack others in the hospital.

A quarantine is ordered, and the Doctor, Cassandra/Rose, and the remaining Sisters try to flee the lower levels. Cassandra is able to jump her mind between other bodies, including one of the infected humans, and learns that the infected humans feel a strong sense of loneliness of not being able to touch or be touched. Eventually, the Doctor and Cassandra/Rose reach Ward 26 and grab all the intravenous medical solutions, emptying them into a disinfectant shower. They are able to spray the mixture onto a group of the infected humans, who within moments become cured of their diseases. The Doctor encourages them to go and spread the cure to the other infected people, and soon the attack is over. The police arrest the surviving Sisters, while the Face of Boe tells the Doctor that the message for him can wait until they meet for the third and final time.

The Doctor orders Cassandra out of Rose's body. Cassandra doesn't want to die, and Chip volunteers to accept her consciousness. Chip's cloned body begins to fail, and Cassandra finally accepts her impending true death. The Doctor decides to do one last thing for Cassandra and takes her back to see herself on the last night someone had called her beautiful. Cassandra/Chip approaches the Lady Cassandra at a party and tells that she is beautiful before collapsing and dying in the younger Cassandra's arms. As Cassandra finally dies, the Doctor and Rose silently leave in the TARDIS.

==Production==
[[Russell T Davies]] said of the episode "I promised Billie [Piper] an episode in which she'd be funny. So episode one of the new series is very much based around comedy for Billie."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Radio Times]]'', 8–14 April&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior scenes on New Earth were shot at Worm's Head on the [[Gower Peninsula]] on 26 September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/doctor-who-wales/alllocations/gower-worms-head|title= Walesarts, Worm's Head, Rhossili, Gower|publisher = [[BBC]] |accessdate = 2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital basement scenes were recorded at [[Tredegar House]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]].&lt;ref name="locations"/&gt; The location for the pods containing the human specimens was a disused paper mill previously used as the base of the [[Auton|Nestene Consciousness]] in "[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]".&lt;ref name="locations"/&gt; The hospital scenes were filmed inside the [[Wales Millennium Centre]].&lt;ref name="locations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/tours/events/pages/doctorwho_s2e1.shtml?1|title=Doctor Who New Earth location guide|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Doctor asks about the shop and points to where he would put it, he points to the location of the centre's own Portmeirion shop.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The nightclub the Doctor and Rose take Cassandra (as Chip) to at the end was filmed at the restaurant Ba Orient in Cardiff Bay. As it was filmed during the day, the building was covered with black drapes.&lt;ref name="locations"/&gt; The exterior shots of the lift car as Rose descends to the basement are reused footage from "Rose".{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Cassandra's face and body was put in during post-production by [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]].&lt;ref name="locations"/&gt;

The producer's and director's credits have been amended slightly since "The Christmas Invasion", so that now the credit is in lower case and the name of the crewmember is in capitals. This was the result of a suggestion from a ''Doctor Who Magazine'' editor, who felt the previous arrangement had made the job seem more important than the crewmember.

This episode is set twenty-three years after the events of the 2005 episode "[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]", and thirty years prior to the events of the 2007 episode "[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]". Originally, Davies intended the Face of Boe to impart his message upon the Doctor in this episode; when he discovered that a third series was definitely to occur, Davies quickly decided to delay Boe's message for a year.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

According to Russell T Davies on the episode commentary, Cassandra's earlier self bases Chip on the man who had praised her beauty at the party&amp;nbsp;— Chip himself. Where the "pattern" for Chip comes from in the first instance is thus unclear, creating an [[ontological paradox]].

Also in the commentary, Tennant noted that the TARDIS has moved since "[[The Christmas Invasion]]". He speculates that there might have been many off-screen adventures, or (observing that it no longer seems like Christmas in the introduction) perhaps that the Doctor "lived there for a bit".

===Cast notes===
Adjoa Andoh returned to ''Doctor Who'' in five episodes of Series 3 and the final two episodes of Series 4, as [[Francine Jones]], mother of [[Martha Jones]]. She also played Nurse Albertine in the audio play ''[[Year of the Pig]]''.

==Outside references==
Cassandra uses the UK [[slang]] term [[chav]], although she is unable to mimic Rose's accent properly, instead making attempts at [[Cockney rhyming slang]]. Rose refers to Cassandra as "[[Michael Jackson]]" as she did in "[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]". She refers to Chip as "[[Gollum]]".

==Broadcast and reception==
Overnight ratings for the episode peaked at 8.3 million viewers in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4914294.stm | title = Doctor Who attracts eight million | publisher = [[BBC News]]  | date = 2006-04-16 |accessdate=2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a final rating of 8.62 million, making it the ninth most watched programme of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30?|title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes|publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]]|accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode achieved an audience [[Appreciation Index]] of 85.&lt;ref name="DWMComp"&gt;{{citation |date=9 November 2006 |title = none |periodical=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]: Series Two Companion |issue=14 – Special Edition |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first ''Doctor Who'' episode to have an accompanying [[TARDISODE]].

The Canadian [[English language|English-language]] premiere of Series 2 on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], consisting of this episode, took place on 9 October 2006. It concluded with an extended version of the "[[Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|Tooth and Claw]]" trailer from the BBC broadcast; the revised closing theme was not heard in the broadcast and it was also the first episode to be broadcast without a specially taped introduction featuring one of the lead actors. The episode had previously aired on 29 August 2006 in translation on the [[French language|French-language]] broadcaster [[Ztélé]], under the title ''Une nouvelle Terre''.

This episode was released together with "The Christmas Invasion" as a basic [[DVD]] with no special features on 1 May 2006, and as part of a second series [[boxset]] on 20 November 2006. *Copies of the DVD from the complete Series 2 set distributed to [[Netflix]] customers contained an error: at the 32-minute mark, the playback switched abruptly to a scene from ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning]]''. Netflix has pulled the disc from their inventory while they work out the issue with the BBC; this only seems to have affected Netflix copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jeremy

[[IGN]]'s rated the episode 7.2 out of 10, concluding, "Although this was an entertaining episode, it did not have the dramatic impact of the [[The Christmas Invasion|previous episode]]. Overall, "New Earth" featured more than a few interesting moments, such as the scenes with the Doctor and the Face of Boe, and Billie Piper's performance as the Casandra-possessed Rose was hilarious; but the zombie attack felt quite out of place for a ''Doctor Who'' episode".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ahsan|last=Haque|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/736/736698p1.html|title=Doctor Who: "New Earth" Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2 October 2006|accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Setchfield of ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' questioned whether the "brash, colourful and occasionally howl-out-loud funny" tone was appropriate enough to start the series, but he praised the concept of the cat nuns as well as their prosthetics, Tennant's performance, and the ending that "alchemises the broad strokes comedy into something genuinely moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Setchfield|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/news/doctor_who_new_earth|title=Doctor Who: New Earth|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509235944/http://www.sfx.co.uk/news/doctor_who_new_earth|archivedate=9 May 2006|work=SFX|date=30 March 2006|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' in 2014, Alasdair Wilkins gave "New Earth" the grade of "C+". He noted that, likely due to production difficulties, it "too often feels like it is missing vital context" and suffered from unconvincing special effects. Furthermore, he criticised the story for being "caught between two irreconcilable tones" and featuring a "baffling" ending that wished to redeem Cassandra. Nevertheless, he found Tennants performance to be impressive though not as coherent as he eventually will be, and he praised Piper despite the fact that the story lacked Rose's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alasdair|last=Wilkins|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/new-earthtooth-and-claw-107061|title=Review: Doctor Who: "New Earth"/"Tooth and Claw"|publisher=''[[The A.V.

The foundation conducts projects to improve health, mostly in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and in [[south-east Asia]].

== History ==

The Novartis Foundation has been one of the leading organizations in the private sector for international development for the last 35 years. The humanitarian engagement of the Novartis Foundation goes back to the 1960s, when the Basel-based companies [[Novartis|Ciba]], Geigy, [[Sandoz]], Durand &amp; Huguenin, [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] and [[Lonza Group|Lonza]] founded the Basel Foundation for Developing Countries. The Basel Foundation, for example, supported the field laboratory of the [[Swiss Tropical Institute]] (now known as the [[Ifakara Health Institute]]) located in [[Ifakara]], which still works closely with the Novartis Foundation.

Today, the Novartis Foundation focuses its work on the fight against [[leprosy]] and [[malaria]], as well as on access to healthcare projects. The foundation acts as facilitator between the [[private sector]], the [[Sovereign state|state]] and [[civil society]].

== Projects ==

The Novartis Foundation supports access to healthcare in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The aim is to improve access to [[primary healthcare]] and to strengthen the local [[healthcare systems]].

The foundation fosters health policy among the [[private sector]], [[non-governmental organizations]], [[research institute|research institutions]] and state organizations. The foundation organizes an international [[symposium]] in Basel every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novartisfoundation.org/platform/apps/project/view.asp?MenuID=245&amp;ID=539&amp;Menu=3&amp;Item=44.12&amp;MasterId=186 Website Novartis Foundation: Projects]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novartisfoundation.org/platform/content/element/2801/Novartis_Foundation_Annual_report_2008.pdf Annual Report 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other organisations called 'Novartis Foundation' ==

The '''Novartis Foundation''' was a scientific and educational charity, formed in 1949 by the Swiss company Ciba, now [[Novartis]], and dissolved in 2008. It was the direct successor to the Ciba Foundation, and the changed name (Novartis Foundation) reflected the new name of Ciba, after merging with Sandoz. The Foundation was the brainchild of [[Robert Käppeli]], Managing Director (and later President) of Ciba.  The purpose of the institution was to promote collaboration in the medical sciences by the organisation of symposia which would allow experts of different fields to share ideas. Symposia took place both at their [[London]] premises and also in locations across the globe. Later these discussions were written up by in-house editors and published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], with whom the foundation had a long-standing relationship.

Novartis, though it provided financial support for the foundation, was not (in later years) represented on the Board of Trustees and occupied only a minority of seats on the executive council. The company withdrew their financial support from the foundation in February 2008. The trustees chose to undergo a merger with the [[Academy of Medical Sciences]], which occurred on 31 July 2008 prior to the dissolution of the foundation later that year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novartisfound.org.uk |title=novartisfound.org.uk |publisher=novartisfound.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The foundation had its headquarters at 41 Portland Place in central [[London]], [[UK]]. The headquarters was refurbished and reopened by the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novartisfound.org.uk/ |title=novartisfound.org.uk |publisher=novartisfound.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">'''Nursing literature''' refers to articles in journals and texts in books devoted to the field of [[nursing]].

==History==
===Nursing journals===
Under the influence of [[Florence Nightingale]], nursing became a scientific field of study and an independent discipline in healthcare.  On March 6, 1886, the first nursing journal, ''[[The Nightingale (journal)|The Nightingale]]'' was published, becoming the first nursing journal. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nursing History Calendar|url=http://www.aahn.org/nursinghistorycalendar.html|publisher=American Association for the History of Nursing|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1900, the ''[[American Journal of Nursing]]'' began publication, becoming the first nursing journal to be owned and operated by nurses.  It remains the oldest nursing journal still in circulation.

In 1952, the first journal dedicated to [[nursing research]], ''[[Nursing Research (journal)|Nursing Research]]'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nursing History Calendar|url=http://www.aahn.org/nursinghistorycalendar.html|publisher=American Association for the History of Nursing|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the profession grew, new journals began to be published, including journals dedicated to various [[nursing specialties]].

[[Nursing journal]]s remain a primary method in which the nursing community shares information and disseminates research findings. These journals are most often [[Peer review#Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] and contain [[editorial]]s and reports of original research, including [[randomized controlled trials]], [[observational studies]], [[systematic review]]s, [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], and [[qualitative research]].  Some journals also include [[case report]]s and [[case study|case studies]].

With the advent of [[evidence-based nursing]], the number of journals blossomed.

Most journal articles are indexed in [[National Library of Medicine]]'s [[PubMed]] database as well as various other databases, including [[CINAHL]].

===Nursing texts===
Nightingale wrote extensively during her years as a nurse.  Her most important work was [[Notes on Nursing]] in which she provided instructions for caregivers, including nurses, on how to provide care to the wounded and sick, as well as [[health promotion]] topics.  Although not officially a textbook for nursing, it is considered the first scientific writing about nursing care.

The first scholarly textbook for nursing is generally accepted as ''[[Text-Book of the Principles and Practice of Nursing]]'' by [[Bertha Harmer]], a Canadian nurse and early [[nurse educator]].  [[Virginia Henderson]] is regarded as one of the earliest nurse educators to expand the scholarly writings of nursing into textbooks for use in schools and colleges of nursing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5643">&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nursepin1.jpg|thumb|left|A nurse's pin from a [[nursing school]], given to nursing graduates of their school's [[pinning ceremony]].]] --&gt;A '''nursing pin''' is a type of [[badge]], usually made of metal such as [[gold]] or [[silver]], which is worn by [[nurse]]s to identify the [[nursing school]] from which they graduated. They are traditionally presented to the newly graduated nurses by the faculty at a [[pinning ceremony]] as a symbolic welcome into the profession. Most pins have a symbolic meaning, often representing the history of the nursing program for that school of nursing.

[[Image:Vassiliev.jpg|thumb|[[Baron Vassiliev]], a 19th-century Knight Commander of the Knights Hospitaller, bearing a badge with [[Maltese cross]] design]]
The ancestor of the nursing pin is the [[Maltese cross]]. Some significant historical contributors to the foundation of hospital standards involved in using the Maltese cross were the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and [[Order of Saint Lazarus]], pioneers of communicable disease care, such as [[leprosy]], [[syphilis]], and other [[chronic (medical)|chronic]] [[skin diseases]] during their period, and established one of a few hospitals in the territories of their reign.&lt;ref name= "Kozier2004"&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Historical and Contemporary Nursing Practice |title= Fundamentals of Nursing: Concepts, Process, and Practice

Such pins were then awarded to nurses who were needed by society during periods of spread of uncontrolled illnesses during the early period, and to recognize them as nurses who are educated, trained and experienced in the said field.&lt;ref name= "Rode1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rode |first= M.W. |title= The nursing pin: Symbol of 1,000 years of service |journal= Nursing Forum |year= 1989 |volume= 24 |issue= 1 |pages= 15–7 |pmid= 2694101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nurse's pins today==
Modern designs of nurses' pins have evolved through time. The Maltese cross, in some nursing educational institutions, has not been incorporated in their pins. Instead, their own seal or logo, such as that of their nursing school, nursing organization or university affiliation is used. The pin is still worn as part of nurses' uniforms today, in such cases, before or even after they graduate from their respective nursing schools and work for medical institutions, such as hospitals and health and wellness centers.

==Nursing symbols==
[[Image:Nursing Badge.png|thumb|left|Mental health pin showing lamp]]
[[Image:RCN Badge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Royal College of Nursing]]]]
[[Image:176queenalex.png|thumb|right|[[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps]]]]
Pins vary widely in shape and imagery, generally about the proportions of a woman's brooch (less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm diameter). A common graphic is an old pattern oil lamp. These lamps or candles were the only lighting available before kerosene became available early in the twentieth century. There are a selection of lamps in the Florence Nightingale museum, thought to have been used in the Scutari hospital in the area known geographically as the Balkans (then British Moldavia, now southern Ukraine), during the war with Russia. American Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote a poem "Saint Philomena" dedicated to the work of Florence in 1857. In this verses, Longfellow characterised Florence as "The lady with the lamp". The poem was used in fundraising for the wounded veterans of the empire. The image of the lamp used by the emerging modern nursing profession took hold.

Another common graphic found on nursing pins is the symbol we associate with the international association of the red crescent and red cross, namely the red cross itself. In times past, young women who adopted the profession of nursing were accepted as nurses, particularly in overseas service roles, such as military and mission work, when they joined the red cross society. Volunteers usually had to supply their own uniforms, equipment and generally had to undertake charitable works in order to raise funds for their own passage to the area of identified need. Red cross nurses are honoured in the 1916 song [[Rose of No Man's Land|Rose of no man's land]] but were by no means the only volunteers. Nurses were also drawn from organisations like the ancient order of deaconesses and quaker ambulance units. The situation changed during the great war, in which the contribution of nursing to the war effort was recognised in several urgent recruitment drives. As nurses were granted access to postings, commissions and pensions, amateur involvement declined.

Another symbol previously used was the sword entwined by double winged serpents. This sword of caduceus was mistakenly used by the United States medical forces in place of the wand of [[Asclepius]] (one serpent without wings on a stick), a long-standing symbol of medical doctors and physicians.

Other common symbols include
* stork and baby, legacy torch,
* fountain of youth
* religious symbols – crucifix, star of David, crescent moon.

Almost 85% of the villages in the country's south cultivate opium poppies. The drug economy provides regular and somewhat reliable income to rural people in this extremely unstable country.The drug sector has been estimated to be worth between $4.1 billion and $6.6 billion, which would amount to about 20% to 32% of the country's gross domestic product in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A sad record|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/most-illegal-opiate-profits-accrue-outside-afghanistan|author=Janet Kursawe |work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=16 November 2018 |accessdate=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
[[File:HeroinWorld-en.svg|thumb|550px|A world map showing heroin production regions]]
Afghanistan first began producing opium in significant quantities in the mid-1950s, to supply its neighbour [[Iran]] after poppy cultivation was banned there. Afghanistan and [[Pakistan]] increased production and became major suppliers of opiates to Western Europe and North America in the mid-1970s, when political instability combined with a prolonged drought disrupted supplies from the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;Felbab-Brown p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet period (1979–1989)===
As the Afghan government began to lose control of provinces during the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of 1979–80]], [[warlord]]s flourished. With that lack of control, opium production also expanded, as regional commanders searched for ways to generate money to purchase weapons, according to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/pdf/in-depth/bitter-sweet-harvest-afghanistans-new-war.pdf |title=UN Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs website – Bitter-Sweet Harvest: Afghanistan's New War |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=August 2, 2004 |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (At this time the United States was pursuing an "arms-length" supporting strategy of the Afghan freedom-fighters or [[Mujahideen]], the main purpose of which was to cripple the [[Soviet Union]] slowly into [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrawal]] through [[Attrition warfare|attrition]] rather than effect a quick and decisive overthrow).

As explained by [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]:

{{quote|The secret operation was an excellent idea. It drew the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it? On the day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter, saying, in essence: 'We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam War.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jauvert|first=Vincent |title=Oui la CIA est entree en Afghanistan avant les Russes|url=http://hebdo.nouvelobs.com/sommaire/documents/008877/oui-la-cia-est-entree-en-afghanistan-avant-les-russes.html |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was alleged by the Soviets on multiple occasions that US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) agents were helping smuggle opium out of Afghanistan, either into the West, in order to raise money for the [[Afghan resistance]], or into the Soviet Union, in order to weaken it through drug addiction. According to [[Alfred W. McCoy|Alfred McCoy]], the CIA supported various Afghan drug lords, for instance [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]&lt;ref name="McCoy1991-11-09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearcave.com/bookrev/nugan_hand.html
|date=November 9, 1991 |title=Interview with Alfred McCoy |first=Paul |last=DeRienzo |authorlink=Paul DeRienzo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others such as [[Ayub Afridi (drug lord)|Haji Ayub Afridi]].

Another factor was the eradication effort inside Pakistan (whose [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] were coincidentally supporters of the [[Mujahideen]]). The Pakistani government, [[USAID|US Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and other groups were involved in attempting to eliminate poppy cultivation from certain areas of the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–2010)|North-West Frontier Province]] (now [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]) bordering Afghanistan. The opium industry shifted from Pakistan into Afghanistan during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=gir1&gt;Killing the Cranes, Edward Girardet, [http://www.chelseagreen.com/bookstore/item/killing_the_cranes Chelsea Green] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812143525/http://www.chelseagreen.com/bookstore/item/killing_the_cranes |date=August 12, 2014}} publisher.

===Warlord period (1989–1994)===
When the [[Soviet Army]] was forced to withdraw in 1989, a [[power vacuum]] was created. Various Mujahideen factions started fighting against each other for power. With the discontinuation of Western support, they resorted ever more to poppy cultivation to finance their military existence.

===Rise of the Taliban (1994–2001)===
During the [[Taliban rule in Afghanistan|Taliban rule]], Afghanistan saw a bumper opium crop of {{Convert|4500|metric ton|ton}} in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Press conference on Afghanistan opium survey 2004|publisher=United Nations|date=November 18, 2004|url=https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2004/McCleanBriefing_041118.doc.htm |accessdate=January 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, Taliban leader [[Mullah Mohammed Omar]], collaborating with the UN to eradicate heroin production in Afghanistan, declared that growing poppies was un-Islamic, resulting in one of the world's most successful anti-drug campaigns. The Taliban enforced a ban on poppy farming via threats, forced eradication, and public punishment of transgressors. The result was a 99% reduction in the area of opium poppy farming in Taliban-controlled areas, roughly three quarters of the world's supply of heroin at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reformdrugpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/AfghanTalibanOpium.pdf Where have all the flowers gone?: evaluation of the Taliban crackdown against opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408055710/http://reformdrugpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/AfghanTalibanOpium.pdf |date=April 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was effective only briefly due to the deposition of the Taliban in 2002.

However, some people (Martin, An Intimate War, 2014), suggest that certain parties benefited from the price increase during the ban. Some{{Who|date=June 2014}}, even believe it was a form of [[market manipulation]] on the part of certain drug lords. Dried opium, unlike most agricultural products, can easily be stored for long periods without refrigeration or other expensive equipment. With huge stashes of opium stored in secret hideaways, the Taliban and other groups that were involved in the drug trade were in theory able to make huge personal profits during the price spikes after the 2000 ban and the chaos following the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;''Seeds of Terror'', [[Gretchen Peters (journalist)|Gretchen Peters]], MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOUTHASIAEXT/Resources/Publications/448813-1164651372704/UNDC_Ch5.pdf PRICES AND MARKET INTERACTIONS IN THE OPIUM ECONOMY] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605123543/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOUTHASIAEXT/Resources/Publications/448813-1164651372704/UNDC_Ch5.pdf |date=June 5, 2013 }}, William A.

===Afghan War (2001–current)===
[[File:Afghan Opium Production 2005 2007.JPG|thumb|Opium production levels for 2005–2007]]
By November 2001, and with the start of the [[Afghan War]], the collapse of the economy and the scarcity of other sources of revenue forced many of the country's farmers to resort to growing opium for export ({{Cvt|1300|km2||disp=or}} in 2004 according to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UN Office on Drugs and Crime]]).

In December 2001, a number of prominent Afghans met in [[Bonn, Germany]], under UN auspices to develop a plan to reestablish the [[State of Afghanistan]], including provisions for a new constitution and national elections. As part of that agreement, the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) was designated the lead country in addressing counter-narcotics issues in Afghanistan.

Two of the following three growing seasons saw record levels of opium poppy cultivation. Corrupt officials may have undermined the government's enforcement efforts. Afghan farmers claimed that "government officials take bribes for turning a blind eye to the drug trade while punishing poor opium growers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Smith |first=Graeme |author-link=Graeme Smith |title=Portrait of the enemy |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |page=A16 |date=March 22, 2008 |url=http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?t=131245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another obstacle to getting rid of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan is the reluctant collaboration between US forces and Afghan warlords in hunting drug traffickers. In the absence of the Taliban, the warlords largely control the opium trade but are also highly useful to US forces in scouting, providing local intelligence, keeping their own territories clean from [[Al-Qaeda]] and Taliban insurgents, and even taking part in military operations.

While US and allied efforts to combat the drug trade have been stepped up, the effort is hampered by the fact that many suspected drug traffickers are now top officials in the Karzai government.&lt;ref name="www_csmonitor_com23"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0513/p01s04-wosc.html|title=Afghanistan riddled with drug ties|accessdate =27 September 2007|work=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates made in 2006 by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimate that 52% of the nation's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], amounting to US$2.7 billion annually, is generated by the drug trade.&lt;ref name="www_msnbc_msn_com25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10663339/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627224735/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/10663339/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 27, 2006|title=msnbc.msn.com|accessdate=27 September 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in production has been linked to the deteriorating security situation, as production is markedly lower in areas with stable security.&lt;ref name="www_unodc_org26"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press_release_2007_03_05.html|title=unodc.org|accessdate=27 September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518154229/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press_release_2007_03_05.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some, the extermination of the poppy crops is not seen as a viable option because the sale of poppies constitutes the livelihood of Afghanistan's rural farmers.

The facts of an apparently non-significant resultant change to opium production is corroborated in a report by [[BBC]], dated to 20 July 2015:&lt;ref&gt;David Loyn – [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33557320 BBC News, Helmand (foot of the page, last 2 paragraphs)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121041156/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33557320 |date=November 21, 2016}} published by BBC News 20 July 2015 [Retrieved 2015-08-02]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Nine years of intense fighting by international troops did nothing to stop the production. In fact it only became worse. The only difference was that it has been pushed out beyond the central populated zone to less governed badlands beyond the Helmand canal.}}

===Foreign involvement===
{{See also|Allegations of CIA drug trafficking#Afghanistan|CIA transnational anti-crime and anti-drug activities#Southwest Asia|CIA activities in Afghanistan}}

Approximately 40,000 foreign troops attempted to manage "security" in Afghanistan, principally of 32,000 regular soldiers from 37 NATO forces: the [[International Security Assistance Force]]. 8,000 US and other special operations forces, mainly [[Academi|privately contracted]] [[Mercenary|soldiers of fortune]],&lt;ref name="RT20150401" /&gt; make up the balance. There is significant resistance, both from the ideological and theocratic [[Taliban]], especially in southern Afghanistan, and independent local warlords and drug organizations. [[Antonio Maria Costa]], Executive Director of UNODC, described the situation: "There is no rule of law in most of the southern parts of Afghanistan—the bullets rule."

==Production and distribution==

===Drug trafficking===
The following areas of Afghanistan play a role in the drug trafficking:
*Production
**"Southern region" of [[Helmand]] and [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]] provinces, on the border with [[Pakistan]], which are the highest-volume areas for drug transactions. There is a traditional route from Helmand, through Pakistan, to Iran
*Smuggling
**[[Herat]], in Herat Province, the Northern Alliance stronghold, which borders [[Iran]]
**[[Fayzabad, Badakhshan|Faizabad]], in [[Badakhshan]] province, which has borders with [[Tajikistan]], Pakistan, and [[China]].

===Labor practices===
According to the [[United States Department of Labor|US Department of Labor]]'s 2014 ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'', opium production is one of the sectors that rely on child labor in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/|title=List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poppy (flower)|Poppies]] being the source of the crude drug, children are still recruited to harvest these flowers in the country's farming fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/afghanistan.htm#ENREF_6|title=Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor – Afghanistan|date=March 2, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide impact==
According to [[European Union]] (EU) agencies, Afghanistan has been Europe's main heroin supplier for more than 10 years.&lt;ref name=eu_1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_62086_EN_emcdda_tds_herointrafficking_2008.pdf|title=Monitoring the supply of heroin to Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heroin enters Europe primarily by two major land routes: the long-standing 'Balkan route' through Turkey; and, since the mid-1990s, the 'northern route', which leaves northern Afghanistan through Central Asia and on to Russia (and is sometimes colloquially referred to as the 'silk route'). There is an estimated 1.5 million (1.3–1.7 million) opioid users in the EU, with an average prevalence of 4 to 5 per 1,000.&lt;ref name=eu_1 /&gt; In 2005, there were around 7,000 acute drug deaths, with opioids being present in the blood of 70% of the deceased.&lt;ref name=eu_1 /&gt; There was a minimum of 49,000 [[seizures]] resulting in the interception of an estimated {{Convert|19.4|metric ton|ton}} of heroin. Countries reporting the largest number of seizures (in descending order): UK (2005), Spain, Germany, Greece, and France. Countries reporting the largest quantities of heroin seized in 2005 (in descending order): Turkey, UK, Italy, France, the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=eu_1 /&gt;

Presently with the resurgence of high output production of opium and heroin in post-Taliban Afghanistan, there is an ongoing heroin addiction epidemic in Russia which is claiming 30,000 lives each year, mostly among young people. There were two and half million heroin addicts in Russia by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8600847.stm |work=BBC News  | title=The heroin epidemic advancing on Russia | date=April 3, 2010 | first=Rupert | last=Wingfield-Hayes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical production==
[[The International Council on Security and Development (ICOS)]] has proposed legalizing opium production for medical purposes.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Opium can be manufactured into [[codeine]] and [[morphine]], which are both legal pain-killers. The Governor of Afghanistan's Helmand Province, [[Hayatullah Hayat]] is a proponent of eventually legalizing opium production to create morphine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=David Greene (host, Morning Edition), Hayatullah Hayat (Governor of Helmand Province, Afghanistan), Tom Bowman (reporter), Dianne Feinstein (U.S. Senator from California, Chair of the Caucus on International Narcotics Control)|date=6 July 2016|title=Afghan Governor Wants Government To Control Poppy Crop|medium=Radio broadcast|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/07/06/484894669/afghan-governor-wants-government-to-control-poppy-crop|access-date=6 July 2016|time=0:20|publisher=NPR
|quote=Now the new governor of the top poppy growing area has a new idea: have the Afghan government control the poppy harvest by licensing farmers and processing the poppies for medical morphine to be used in hospitals. Governor Hayatullah Hayat of Helmand Province told NPR this could relieve a worldwide demand for morphine. Proponents believe legalization could help solve the problem of illicit opium production in Afghanistan and lower the price of prescription drugs worldwide, thus making healthcare more affordable for those requiring those drugs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that legalizing opium production would neither solve the problem nor would it be workable in practice. They argue that illegal diversion of the crop could only be minimized if the Afghans had the necessary resources, institutional capacity and control mechanisms in place to ensure that they were the sole purchaser of opiate raw materials. For them, there is currently no infrastructure in place to set up and administer such a scheme. They reason that in the absence of an effective control system, traffickers would be free to continue to exploit the market and there would be a high risk that licit cultivation would be used for illegal purposes and that the Afghan government would be in direct competition with the traffickers, thereby driving up the price of opium, and attracting more farmers to cultivate. The Afghan government has ruled out licit cultivation as a means of tackling the illegal drug trade: however in Turkey in the 1970s, legalizing opium production, with US support brought illicit trafficking under control within four years. Afghan villages have strong local control systems based around the village [[shura]], which with the support of the Afghan government and its international allies, could provide the basis for an effective control system. This idea is developed in the recent [[Senlis Council]] report "Poppy for Medicine"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/documents/poppy_medicine_technical_dossier] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713105237/http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/documents/poppy_medicine_technical_dossier |date=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which proposes a technical model for the implementation of poppy licensing and the legal control of cultivation and production of Afghan morphine.

Some believe that there is also little evidence to show that Afghan opium would be economically competitive in a global market place. Australia, France, India, Spain, and Turkey currently dominate the export market for licit opiates. Due to the high cost of production in countries where cultivation is undertaken on small landholdings, such as India and Turkey, licit production requires market support (the production costs for the equivalent of 1&amp;nbsp;kg of morphine in 1999 was US$56 in Australia, US$159.77 in India and US$250 in Turkey). The current cost of production of one kilogram of morphine equivalent in Afghanistan is approximately US$450{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. However, a poppy for medicine project in [[Afghanistan]] could provide a cheap pain relief option for pain sufferers who find morphine prices extremely elevated.

The price of illicit opium far exceeds that of licit, (in India, in 2000, the price for licit opium was US$13–29 per kilo, but for illicit US$155–206). Although there are many complex reasons behind the decision to grow poppy, one of them is the current economic dependence of poppy farmers on the illicit trade. Whilst traffickers continue to be free to exploit the illicit market, legalization would not change this. Demand for illicit opiates would not disappear even if Afghan opium were used for licit purposes and a vacuum would open that traffickers could exploit. However, currently 100% of Afghan opium is diverted to the illegal opium trade and funds in some cases terrorist activities. Despite eradication efforts since the international intervention in 2001, poppy cultivation and illicit opium production has increased, as UNODC figures show. A licensing system would bring farmers and villages into a supportive relationship with the Afghan government, instead of alienating the population by destroying their livelihood, and provide the economic diversification that could help cultivators break ties with the illicit opium trade.

The [[International Narcotics Control Board]] states that an over production in licit opiates since 2000 has led to stockpiles in producing countries 'that could cover demand for two years'. Thus, some say Afghan opium would contribute to an already oversupplied market and would potentially cause the supply and demand imbalance that the UN control system was designed. However, the [[World Health Organization]] points out that there is an acute global shortage of poppy-based medicines such as morphine and codeine. This is largely due to chronic underprescription (especially in countries where morphine is extremely highly priced). The [[International Narcotics Control Board]] which regulates opium supply throughout the world enforces the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]]: this law provides that countries can only demand the raw poppy materials corresponding to the use of opium-based medicines over the last two years and thus limits countries who have low levels of prescription in terms of the amounts they can demand. As such, 77% of the world's opium supplies are being used by only six countries, leaving the rest of the world lacking in essential medicines such as morphine and codeine.&lt;ref&gt;See Fischer, B J. Rehm, and T Culbert, "Opium based medicines: a mapping of global supply, demand and needs" in Spivack D. (ed.) ''Feasibility Study on Opium Licensing in Afghanistan'', Kabul, 2005. p.&amp;nbsp;85–86.[http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/008_publication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223024135/http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/008_publication |date=February 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second-tier supply system, that complements the current UN control system by supplying opium-based medicines to countries currently not receiving the poppy-based pain relief medicines needed, would maintain the balance established by the UN system and provide a market to Afghan-made poppy-based medicines.

==The Afghan economy and opium==
[[File:Afghanistan opium poppy cultivation 1994-2007b.PNG|thumb|right|400px|Afghanistan opium poppy cultivation, 1994–2016 (hectares)]]
The 2004 [[United Nations Development Programme]] ranked Afghanistan number 173 of 177 countries, using a human development index, with Afghanistan near or at the bottom of virtually every development indicator including nutrition, infant mortality, life expectancy, and literacy. Several factors encourage opium production, the greatest being economic: the high rate of return on investment from opium poppy cultivation has driven an agricultural shift in Afghanistan from growing traditional crops to growing opium poppy.

Opium cultivation on this scale is not traditional, and in the area controlled by the [[Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority|Helmand Valley Authority]] in the 1950s the crop was largely suppressed.&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01" /&gt;

"Despite the fact that only 12 percent of its land is arable, agriculture is a way of life for 70 percent of Afghans and is the country's primary source of income. During good years, Afghanistan produced enough food to feed its people as well as supply a surplus for export. Its traditional agricultural products include wheat, corn, barley, rice, cotton, fruit, nuts, and grapes. However, its agricultural economy has suffered considerably [...] Afghanistan's largest and fastest cash crop is opium."&lt;ref name="Glaze-2007-10"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub804.pdf |format=PDF |title=Opium and Afghanistan: Reassessing U.S. Counternarcotics Strategy |first=John A. |last=Glaze |date=October 2007 |publisher=Strategic Studies Institute, U.S. Army War College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poppy Cultivation and the Opium Trade have been said to have had a more significant impact on the civilians in Afghanistan than the impact of wheat farming and livestock trading. As farmers in Afghanistan were once heavily reliant on wheat farming to make sufficient income, the development of poppy cultivation has given many of these farmers a boost in capital, even though opium may be a more dangerous product to distribute. In addition, as the demand for Opium has elevated, women have more opportunity to work in the same setting as their male counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Goodhand, Jonathan. 2000. From holy war to opium war? A case study of the opium economy in North Eastern Afghanistan. CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY 19 (2): 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghanistan's rugged terrain encourages local autonomy, which, in some cases, means local leadership committed to an opium economy. The terrain makes surveillance and enforcement difficult.

{{quote|Afghanistan's economy has thus evolved to the point where it is now highly dependent on opium. Although less than 4 percent of arable land in Afghanistan was used for opium poppy cultivation in 2006, revenue from the harvest brought in over $3 billion—more than 35 percent of the country's total gross national product (GNP). According to Antonio Costa, "Opium poppy cultivation, processing, and transport have become Afghanistan's top employers, its main source of capital, and the principal base of its economy."  Today, a record 2.9 million Afghanis from 28 of 34 provinces are involved in opium cultivation in some way, which represents nearly 10 percent of the population. Although Afghanistan's overall economy is being boosted by opium profits, less than 20 percent of the $3 billion in opium profits actually goes to impoverished farmers, while more than 80 percent goes into the pockets of Afghan's opium traffickers and kingpins and their political connections. Even heftier profits are generated outside of Afghanistan by international drug traffickers and dealers.&lt;ref name="Glaze-2007-10" /&gt;}}
{{quote|Traditionally, processing of Afghan's opium into heroin has taken place outside of Afghanistan; however, in an effort to reap more profits internally, Afghan drug kingpins have stepped up heroin processing within their borders. Heroin processing labs have proliferated in Afghanistan since the late 1990s, particularly in the unstable southern region, further complicating stabilization efforts. With the reemergence of the Taliban and the virtual absence of the rule of law in the countryside, opium production and heroin processing have dramatically increased, especially in the southern province of Helmand.&lt;ref name="Glaze-2007-10" /&gt;}}

According to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) ''2007 Afghanistan Opium Survey'', Afghanistan produced approximately 8,200 metric tonnes of opium – nearly double the estimate of global annual consumption.&lt;ref name="CSDP"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Afghanistan Update: Heroin Production On The Rise Again In Afghanistan |date=November 19, 2007 |publisher=Common Sense for Drug Policy |url=http://www.csdp.org/news/news/afghanistan.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 25, 2007 op-ed in the ''Washington Post'', [[Antonio Maria Costa]], Executive Director of UNODC, asked "Does opium defy the laws of economics? Historically, no. In 2001, prices surged tenfold from 2000, to a record high, after the Taliban all but eliminated opium poppy cultivation across the Afghan territory under its control. So why, with last year's bumper crop, is the opposite not occurring? Early estimates suggest that opium cultivation is likely to increase again this year. That should be an added incentive to sell.

He speculated, "So where is it? I fear there may be a more sinister explanation for why the bottom has not fallen out of the opium market: major traffickers are withholding significant amounts.

"Drug traffickers have a symbiotic relationship with insurgents and terrorist groups such as the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Instability makes opium cultivation possible; opium buys protection and pays for weapons and foot soldiers, and these in turn create an environment in which drug lords, insurgents and terrorists can operate with impunity.

"Opium is the glue that holds this murky relationship together. If profits fall, these sinister forces have the most to lose.

[[File:Afghan poppies.jpg|thumb|[[Voice of America]] reporter interviewing poppy cultivators.]]
Due to globalization and the development of trade, traditional ways of sustaining life for villagers has been forced to change. Before, people relied on wheat farming and livestock, whereas today, poppy cultivation is the most prominent economic activity.&lt;ref name=goodhand&gt;Goodhand, J. 1999. "From Holy War to Opium War?: a Case Study of the Opium Economy in North Eastern Afghanistan." PEACE BUILDING AND COMPLEX POLITICAL EMERGENCY. Working Paper Series. Paper No 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to higher profits from poppy cultivation and lack of opportunity for other farming practices due to land scarcity and more accessible loans from money providers for this activity.&lt;ref name=goodhand /&gt;

War, economic instability, and poverty caused changes in the way villagers maintained their villages. Competition for scarce land and resources resulted in unsustainable practices, causing soil erosion and therefore making the land less productive. The cultivation of poppy, however, generated greater profits than wheat farming for the farming villagers due to the higher yielding possibilities with less land (poppies require less irrigation than wheat), and greater demand for the profitable drug trade of the highly valued opium, prepared from poppies. Many emigrants to places such as Pakistan and Iran witnessed the profitability of poppy cultivation in land development, through association with local landowners and businessmen, and were inspired to bring about the same economic improvement in their own lives and villages. Also, opium trade proved to be more cost-efficient than livestock trade, since large amounts of opium are easier to transport than livestock. Local shopkeepers used capital, which was acquired from buying opium resins from farmers and selling them to dealers at the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border, to invest in their own small shops, generating more income. Poor villagers saw this as a good investment opportunity, as it meant more efficient farming of one product with the possibility of creating economic stability in their villages.&lt;ref&gt;Goodhand, Jonathan. 2000. "From holy war to opium war? A case study of the opium economy in North Eastern Afghanistan." ''Central Asian Survey'' 19 (2):265–280.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts of opium production within Afghan villages===
Aside from the obvious threat of addiction, opium production is changing the dynamic of many Afghan villages. Wealth distribution, for example, has changed significantly as the opium economy has created a "new rich" in which young men have control. This newfound wealth for the young men of Afghanistan is troubling to many of the village leaders as before they were revered for their wisdom, and now are given little if any respect. It has also been noted that relationships among fathers and sons, neighbours, and family in general, are drastically changing as leadership roles in the economy continue to shift.&lt;ref name="Goodhand, Jonathan 2000"&gt;Goodhand, Jonathan. 2000. "From holy war to opium war? A case study of the opium economy in North Eastern Afghanistan." ''Central Asian Survey'' 19 (2):256–280&lt;/ref&gt; As the young men have increased contact with the outer world, they have become aware of different methods of performing traditional tasks, which have created tensions between the young men and the white beards. Also, there has been a shift from the level of co-operation, trust, and reciprocity within villages to a move of self-interest, all of which have been adversely affected by the war.&lt;ref name="Goodhand, Jonathan 2000" /&gt;

==Production and Afghan governance==
[[File:ANA soldier shows opium captured in an alleged Taliban safe house in Helmand.jpg|thumb|An [[Afghan National Police]] officer is picking up a bag of opium in 2009 inside a house that was raided in [[Helmand Province]].]]
While the Taliban were considered a threat both to the human rights of Afghans, and to other areas of the world by providing a sanctuary for transnational terrorists, they also demonstrated an ability to strictly enforce a moratorium on opium production. Since their overthrow in 2001, stopping their enforcement with methods including beheading, opium poppy cultivation has been steadily increasing for over the past two decades.&lt;ref name="Glaze-2007-10" /&gt; There is evidence that the Taliban ban carried the seeds of its own lack of sustainability, due to a many-fold increase in the burden of opium-related debt (locking many households into dependence on future opium poppy cultivation), forcing asset sales to make ends meet, etc. It also appears that the opium ban weakened the Taliban politically. Thus the sustainability of the ban beyond the first year was highly doubtful, even if the
Taliban had not been overthrown in late 2001.&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/afg/publications/afghanistan_drug_industry.pdf |format=PDF|title=Afghanistan's Drug Industry Book: Structure, Functioning, Dynamics and Implications for Counter-Narcotics Policy |chapter=1: Introduction and Overview |first1=William A. |last1=Byrd |first2=Doris |last2=Buddenberg |publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Even though the Karzai government made opium poppy cultivation and trafficking illegal in 2002, many farmers, driven by poverty, continue to cultivate opium poppy to provide for their families. Indeed, poverty is the primary reason given by Afghan farmers for choosing to cultivate opium poppy."  With a farm gate price of approximately $125 per kilogram for
dry opium, an Afghan farmer can make 17 times more profit growing opium poppy ($4,622 per hectare), than by growing wheat ($266 per hectare).  "Opium poppy is also drought resistant, easy to transport and store, and, unlike many crops, requires no refrigeration and does not spoil."&lt;ref name="Glaze-2007-10" /&gt; With Afghanistan's limited irrigation, in which [[Qanat#Technical features|qanats]] [[Kariz (water supply)|(karez)]] still play a big role, transportation and other agricultural infrastructure, growing alternative crops is not only less profitable, but more difficult.

In 2006, opium production in the province increased over 162 percent and now accounts for 42 percent of Afghan's total opium output. According to the UNODC, the opium situation in the southern provinces is "out of control."

===Corruption and the erosion of the rule of law===
{{quote|Corruption associated with the opium economy has spread to all levels of the Afghan government from the police to the parliament, and is eroding the rule of law. Farmers routinely bribe police and counternarcotics eradication personnel to turn a blind eye. Law enforcement personnel are also paid off by drug traffickers to ignore or, in some cases, protect their movements. Afghan government officials are now believed to be involved in at least 70 percent of opium trafficking, and experts estimate that at least 13 former or present provincial governors are directly involved in the drug trade...In some cases...[local leaders] are the same individuals who cooperated with the United States in ousting the Taliban in 2001.

Working with the UK and the Afghan government, the United States developed its own strategy to counter the opium problem in Afghanistan, which has the following five pillars:
#alternative livelihoods
#elimination and eradication
#interdiction
#law enforcement and justice reform
#public information&lt;ref name="Glaze-2007-10" /&gt;}}

The Department of State (DoS), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Justice (DoJ) are the primary organizations involved in carrying out this counternarcotics strategy for the US. The role of the CIA has not been mentioned. UNODC's executive director believes these measures are insufficient: "What can be done? Since NATO forces are wary of making enemies out of opium farmers by being associated with eradication, and since the Afghan government is opposed to spraying poppy fields, rounding up the major traffickers may be the best available option for disrupting Afghanistan's lucrative opium market."

Both demand and supply reduction are important. "the consuming countries need to get serious about curbing drug addiction. If there was less demand for heroin, the bottom really would fall out of the opium market." Farmers economically dependent on opium must have viable alternatives that give sustainable income. On the supply side, identifying the most-wanted traffickers and subjecting them to international arrest warrants with extradition, asset seizure, and travel bans could help. While it is not easy to destroy opium storage and heroin production laboratories, it is far easier to destroy drugs at the source than in transit.&lt;ref name="WaPo2007-04-25" /&gt;
{{quote|Afghanistan's neighbors are either accomplices or victims in the opium trade, so they need to be part of the solution. They could, for example, improve intelligence-sharing and border security to ensure that more opium is seized. At the moment, less than a quarter of the world's opium is intercepted, compared with around half of global cocaine output.&lt;ref name="WaPo2007-04-25" /&gt;}} This complicates, of course, the complex US relations with Pakistan and Iran.

===Nexus between the drug industry and Hawala===
There is an important nexus between drugs and [[hawala]] (informal money transfer system) in Afghanistan. The UN analysis is based on interviews with a sample of 54 hawala dealers in the main centers of hawala activity of Afghanistan as well as during a visit to [[Peshawar]], Pakistan. In addition, interviews were conducted with users of the hawala system (drug dealers, businessmen, traders, international aid workers), regulators (government officials, central bank personnel), and formal
service providers (bankers, accountants). In addition to hawala, they found protection payments and connections, by which the drug industry has major linkages with local administration as well as high levels of the national government.&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01" /&gt;

See [[Clandestine HUMINT#Informal value transfer systems|informal money transfer systems]] to support clandestine activity, including terrorism, drug trade, and intelligence collection.

Different localities studied by the UNODC give different views of the [[money laundering|laundering]] of drug funds. It is difficult to get a solid sense of the overall economy. In [[Faizabad]], for example, indicated that during certain times of the year close to 100% of the liquidity of the hawala system in the province is derived from drugs, whereas in [[Herat]], the  [[Northern Alliance]] stronghold, it was estimated that only 30% of the hawala market's overall transaction volume is directly linked to drugs. Analysis of data gathered in places like Herat was complicated by confirmed links between drug money and legitimate imports. The southern region (Helmand and Kandahar provinces) is also a key centre for money laundering in Afghanistan (about 60% of the funds are drug related and 80–90% of the hawala dealers in Kandahar [the former Taliban stronghold] and Helmand are involved in money transfers related to narcotics).&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01" /&gt;

Helmand has emerged as a key facilitator of the opium trade, both between provinces and exports, while overall estimates of the local hawala markets' drug-related component are of a similar order of magnitude to those in Kandahar. This finding adds weight to the notion that the major trading centers in these two neighboring provinces should be treated as essentially one market. Bearing this in mind, the study calculated that Helmand could account for roughly US$800 million of Afghanistan's drug-related hawala business and that Herat is the second largest contributor, with in the range of US$
300–500 million of drug money laundered annually.

Furthermore, [[Dubai]] appears to be a central clearing house for international hawala activities. In addition, various cities in Pakistan, notably [[Peshawar]], [[Quetta]], and [[Karachi]], are major transaction centers. It appears that even in the case of drug shipments to Iran, payments for them come into Afghanistan from Pakistan ... the hawala system has been key to the deepening and widening of the "informal economy" in Afghanistan, where there is anonymity and the opportunity to launder money.&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01" /&gt;

Hawala, however, also contributes positively to the regional economy. It has been central to the survival of Afghanistan's financial system through war.&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01" /&gt; According to Maimbo (2003), "integral to processes of early development and vital for the continued delivery of funds to the provinces."&lt;ref name="Maimbo2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www1.worldbank.org/finance/html/amlcft/docs/(06.23.03)%20The%20Hawala%20System%20in%20Afghanistan%20(Maimbo).pdf |format=PDF|title=The Money Exchange Dealers of Kabul: A Study of the Hawala System in Afghanistan |date=June 2003 |first=Samuel Munzele |last=Maimbo |publisher=Finance and Private Sector Unit, South Asia Region, World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The hawala system also plays an important role in currency exchange. It participates in the Central Bank's regular foreign currency auctions, and was instrumental in the successful introduction of a new currency for Afghanistan in 2002–2003."&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01" /&gt;

==Opium smuggling into Iran==
While Herat is not the highest-volume area of opium trade, Herat, and the other Iranian border areas of Farah, and Nimroz, have some of the highest prices, presumably due to demand from the Iranian market.&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch05"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/afg/publications/afghanistan_drug_industry.pdf |format=PDF|title=Afghanistan's Drug Industry Book: Structure, Functioning, Dynamics and Implications for Counter-Narcotics Policy |chapter=5: Prices and Market Interactions in the Opium Economy |first1=William A. |last1=Byrd |first2=Olivier |last2=Jonglez |publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Opium prices are especially high in Iran, where law enforcement is strict and where a large share of the opiate consumption market is still for opium rather than heroin. Not surprisingly, it appears that very significant profits can be made by crossing the Iranian border or by entering Central Asian countries like Tajikistan." According to [[UNODC]] estimates bulk of Afghanistan's opium production goes to Iran either for consumption or for on-ward export to other countries in the region and Europe. Iran currently has [[List of countries by prevalence of opiates use|the largest prevalence of opiate consumption in its population]] globally. Iran also accounts for 84% of total opiate seizures by law enforcement agencies in the world, interdicting tens of thousands of tons of opiates annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_eng_web.pdf WORLD DRUG REPORT 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226160952/http://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_eng_web.pdf |date=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian government has gone through several phases in dealing with its drug problem.

First, during the 1880s, its approach was supply-sided: "Law-and-order policies with zero tolerance led to the arrest of tens of thousands of addicts and the execution of thousands of narcotics traffickers."&lt;ref name="CFR2006-09-14"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Afghanistan's Role in Iran's Drug Problem |first=Lionel |last=Beehner |date=September 14, 2006 |url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/11457/ |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319154656/http://www.cfr.org/publication/11457/ |archivedate=March 19, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There are an estimated 68,000 Iranians imprisoned for drug trafficking and another 32,000 for drug addiction (out of a total prison population of 170,000, based on 2001 statistics)"&lt;ref name="Samii2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.watsoninstitute.org/bjwa/archive/9.2/Iran/Samii.pdf |format=PDF|title=Drug Abuse: Iran's "Thorniest Problem" |first=A. William |last=Samii |date=Winter–Spring 2003 |volume=IX |issue=2 |journal=Brown Journal of World Affairs |publisher=Watson Institute, Brown University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beehner said "Tehran also has spent millions of dollars and deployed thousands of troops to secure its porous 1,000-mile border with Afghanistan and Pakistan... a few hundred Iranian drug police die each year in battles with smugglers. Referring to the head of the UNODC office in Iran, Roberto Arbitrio, Beehner quoted Arbitrio in an interview with ''[[The Times]].'' "You have drug groups like guerrilla forces, [who] ... shoot with rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, and Kalashnikovs."

A second-phase strategy came under then-President [[Mohammad Khatami]], focused more on prevention and treatment.&lt;ref name="CFR2006-09-14" /&gt; Drug traffic is considered a security problem, and much of it is associated with [[Baloch people|Baluchi]] tribesmen, who recognize traditional tribal rather than national borders.&lt;ref name="NYT2001-08-18"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=New York Times |title=Iran Shifts War Against Drugs, Admitting It Has Huge Problem |first=Neil |last=MacFarquahar |date=August 18, 2001 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E6DE103EF93BA2575BC0A9679C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current (2007) reports cite [[CIA activities in Iran#Baluchi guerrillas in Iran|Iranian concern with ethnic guerillas on the borders]], possibly supported by the CIA.

Iranian drug strategy changed again under President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], who took office in 2005. Iran's drug policy has been reconsidered and shifted back toward supply interdiction and boosting border security.&lt;ref name="Samii2003" /&gt; It is unclear if this is connected to more wide-ranging concerns with border security, perhaps in relation to [[CIA activities in Iran#Baluchi guerrillas in Iran|Baluchi guerillas in Iran]].

Iran has alleged that certain drugs are manufactured in Afghanistan under guidance of western powers and solely sent to Iran for consumption such as certain compounds of heroin, [[Crack cocaine]] and CNS stimulants. Iran has also alleged that large quantities of [[Acetic anhydride]] and [[Hydrochloric acid]] are brought to Afghanistan from Europe to be used in manufacturing of drugs as Afghanistan does not have the chemical industry to produce the compounds locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=118740&amp;sectionid=3510212 |title=No Operation |publisher=PressTV |accessdate=November 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603121606/http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=118740&amp;sectionid=3510212 |archivedate=June 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samii's 2003 paper described Iran's "primary approach to the narcotics threat [as] interdiction. Iran shares a 936 kilometer border with Afghanistan and a 909 kilometer border with Pakistan, and the terrain in the two eastern provinces—Sistan va Baluchistan and Khorasan—is very rough. The Iranian government has set up static defenses along this border. This includes concrete dams, berms, trenches, and minefields".&lt;ref name="Samii2003" /&gt;

As per UN drug report of 2011, Iran accounts for highest rate of opium and heroin seizure rates in the world, intercepting 89% of all seized opium in the world. Within a span of thirty years, 3700 Iranian police officers have been killed and tens of thousands more injured in counter narcotics operations mostly on Afghan and Pakistan borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39101&amp;Cr=unodc&amp;Cr1= |title=UN agency foresees increased collaboration with Iran in fight against drugs |publisher=United Nations |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter-narcotics policy==
[[File:Opium eradication poster, Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Anti-poppy propaganda poster. An approximate translation of the text is "Poppies are the crop of death. Grow wheat instead so children can eat and live".]]
Given the fact that a third of the combined legal and illegal Afghan economy is based on the illegal [[opium]] industry, counter-narcotics policy is currently one of the most important elements of domestic politics. Despite law enforcement measures with a dominant focus on crop eradication programs, Afghan opium production has doubled in just two years. This has shown that currently there is no correlation between poppy crop eradication and the level of poppy cultivation or opium production. The reason for this is the underlying economic nature of the opium problem. Poverty and structural unemployment are the main reason for 3.3 million Afghans' full dependence on poppies.

Poppy crop eradication could even have damaging side-effects for Afghanistan's process of stabilization and reconstruction. Director of policy research for the [[Senlis Council]], [[Jorrit Kamminga]], says:{{quote|the poppy eradication campaign has been ineffective, counterproductive and could well give the Taliban the decisive advantage in their struggle for the hearts and minds of the Afghan people.}}

He is referring to US-inspired aerial fumigation campaigns, planned for spring 2008 but never initiated. So far, crop eradication is done manually or mechanically from the ground. Chemical spraying could further destabilize rural areas and risk losing support for NATO's stabilization mission.

===Alternative crops===
Since the Taliban allegedly makes Afghanistan's opium business easy, offering credit, seeds and fertilizer to farmers to grow the drugs that fuel the [[Taliban insurgency]], the US authorities are determined to change that momentum by offering similar incentives to steer farmers away from the drug trade and toward alternative, legitimate crops, like grapes, wheat and [[saffron]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/12/world/AP-AS-Afghanistan-US-Agriculture.html "US Tells Afghans to Grow Grapes Not Opium Poppy"]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Synovitz |first=Ron |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1068856.html |title=Afghanistan: Saffron Could Help Wean Farmers Off Opium Poppies |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=June 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parastremmatic dwarfism''' is a rare [[osteochondrodysplasia|bone disease]] that features severe [[dwarfism]], thoracic [[kyphosis]] (a type of [[scoliosis]] that affects the upper back), a distortion and twisting of the limbs, [[contracture]]s of the large joints, malformations of the [[vertebra]]e and [[pelvis]], and [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. The disease was first reported in 1970 by Leonard Langer and associates; they used the term ''parastremmatic'' from the Greek ''parastremma'', or ''distorted limbs'', to describe it. On [[X-ray]]s, the disease is distinguished by a "flocky" or lace-like appearance to the bones.&lt;ref name=pdad/&gt; The disease is [[congenital disorder|congenital]], which means it is apparent at birth. It is caused by a [[mutation]] in the ''[[TRPV4]]'' gene, located on [[chromosome 12 (human)|chromosome 12]] in humans. The disease is inherited in an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] manner.&lt;ref name=pdad/&gt;&lt;ref name=pd70/&gt;&lt;ref name=pdgene/&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Parastremmatic dwarfism is apparent at birth, with affected infants usually being described as "stiff", or as "twisted dwarfs" when the skeletal deformities and appearance of dwarfism further present themselves. Skeletal deformities usually develop in the sixth to twelfth month of an infant's life. The deformities may be attributed to [[osteomalacia]], a lack of [[bone mineralization]].

== Cause and genetics ==

[[Image:Chromosome 12.svg|thumb|left|90px|The location of genes on chromosome 12]]
Parastremmatic dwarfism is caused by a [[missense mutation]] (where one [[amino acid]] is replaced by another in a [[gene sequence]]) in the ''[[TRPV4]]'' gene,&lt;ref name=pdgene/&gt; [[locus (genetics)|located]] on the long arm of human [[chromosome]] [[chromosome 12 (human)|12]], at 12q24.11.&lt;ref name=omim/&gt; The mutation is in [[exon]] 11 of the gene, and is labelled R594H; this means that the [[codon]] (the code for an amino acid molecule) for [[arginine]] was erroneously substituted by a codon for [[histidine]] at position 594 in that exon. This same mutation in the ''TRVP4'' gene is known to cause the [[spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type|Kozlowski type]] of [[spondylometaphyseal dysplasia]].&lt;ref name=pdgene/&gt;&lt;ref name=pdog/&gt;

Parastremmatic dwarfism is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner,&lt;ref name=pdbk/&gt; which means that the defective gene responsible for the disease is located on an [[autosome]] (chromosome 12 is an autosome), and one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who also has the disorder.&lt;ref name=pdad/&gt;

'''Pneumonitis''' or '''pulmonitis''' is an [[inflammation]] of [[lung]] tissue &lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|six/000084241|pneumonitis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sted28&gt;{{cite book|title=Stedman's medical dictionary.|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-6450-6|edition=28th}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to factors other than microorganisms. Those can be [[radiation therapy]] of the chest &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pneumonitis/DS00962/UPDATEAPP=0|title=Pneumonitis - Symptoms and causes|author=|date=|website=mayoclinic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, exposure to medications used during chemo-therapy, the inhalation of debris (e.g., animal [[dander]]), of food particles during vomiting, herbicides or [[fluorocarbons]] and some systemic diseases. 

It is distinguished from [[pneumonia]] on the basis of causation as well as its manifestation since pneumonia can be described as pneumonitis combined with [[Pulmonary consolidation|consolidation]] and [[exudate|exudation]] of lung tissue due to infection with microorganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|six/000084139|pneumonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
It can be classified into [[acute interstitial pneumonitis]], [[blood pneumonitis]], [[lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis]], [[radiation pneumonitis]], and [[uremic pneumonitis]].&lt;ref name=Sted28/&gt;

==Causes==

* [[virus|Viral infection]]. [[Measles]] can cause severe pneumonitis, and [[ribavirin]] has been proposed as a possible treatment. [[Human cytomegalovirus|CMV]] is another cause.
* [[Pneumonia]]
* Radiation therapy
* Inhaling chemicals, such as sodium hydroxide&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0565.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sepsis]]
* Adverse reaction to medications

'''''Polygonatum''''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|l|ᵻ|ˈ|ɡ|ɒ|n|ə|t|əm}},&lt;ref&gt;''Sunset Western Garden Book''. 1995. 606–607.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''King Solomon's-seal''' or '''Solomon's seal''', is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s. In the [[APG III system|APG III classification system]], it is placed in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Asparagaceae]], subfamily [[Nolinoideae]] (formerly the family Ruscaceae).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Chase |first=M. W. |last2=Reveal |first2=J. L. |last3=Fay |first3=M. F. |year=2009 |title=A subfamilial classification for the expanded asparagalean families Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=132–136 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00999.x|lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been classified in the former family Convallariaceae and, like many [[lilioid monocot]]s, was formerly classified in the lily family, [[Liliaceae]].  The genus is distributed throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Most of the approximately 63 species occur in Asia, with 20 [[endemism|endemic]] to [[China]].&lt;ref name=wuj&gt;Wujisguleng, W., et al. (2012). [http://pbsociety.org.pl/journals/index.php/asbp/article/viewFile/asbp.2012.045/991 Ethnobotanical review of food uses of ''Polygonatum'' (Convallariaceae) in China.] ''Acta Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae'' 81(4) 239-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Polygonatum" comes from the ancient Greek for "many knees", referring to the multiple jointed [[rhizome]].&lt;ref name=AZPLA&gt;{{cite book|last=Coombes|first=A. J.|title=The A to Z of Plant Names|year=2012|publisher=Timber Press|location=USA|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation for the derivation of the common name "[[Solomon]]'s seal" is that the roots bear depressions which resemble royal [[seal (emblem)|seals]]. Another is that the cut roots resemble [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew characters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/s/solsea63.html Solomon's Seal.] Botanical.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The fruits are red or black [[Berry (botany)|berries]].

===Food===
Many species have long been used as food in China. Leaves, stems, and rhizomes are used raw or cooked and served as a side dish with meat and rice. The rhizomes of two local species are eaten with [[Chicken feet|chicken's]] or [[Pig's trotters|pig's feet]] during festivals. The rhizomes are used to make [[tea]] or soaked in [[wine]] or [[liquor]] to flavor the beverages. They are also fried with sugar and honey to make sweet snacks. The starchy rhizomes can be dried, ground, and added to [[flour]] to supplement [[staple food|food staples]]. The rhizome of ''P. sibiricum'' is pulped, boiled, strained, and thickened with barley flour to make a sweet liquid seasoning agent called ''tangxi''. At times, people in China have relied on ''P. megaphyllum'' as a [[famine food]].&lt;ref name=wuj/&gt;

The shoots of some ''Polygonatum'' can be boiled and used like [[asparagus]]. ''P. cirrifolium'' and ''P. verticillatum'' are used as leafy [[vegetable]]s in [[India]]. The American species ''P. biflorum'' has a starchy root that was eaten like the [[potato]] and used as flour for bread.&lt;ref name=wuj/&gt;

''P. sibirica'' is used for a tea called ''dungulle'' in [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=wuj/&gt;

=== Traditional medicine ===

The traditional use of ''Polygonatum'' in the treatment of [[diabetes]] was first observed in 1930 by [[Hedwig Langecker]]. After experiments, she concluded that it was effective in fighting nutritional [[hyperglycemia]], though not that caused by [[adrenaline]] release, probably due to its [[glucokinin]] content.&lt;ref&gt;Source:Quer, Pío Font "Plantas Medicinales - El Dioscórides renovado". 1961/2005 Barcelona: Ediciones Península, {{ISBN|9788483072424}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==History==
===Knights of Malta===
Prostitution has occurred in Malta for centuries. When the [[Knights Hospitaller]] came to the country in 1530, the port of [[Vittoriosa]] contained many brothels. As well as Maltese prostitutes, there were also some from [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[North Africa]]. The [[France|French]] king’s geographer, Nicholas de Nicolai,  was impressed by the number of prostitutes in the streets when he visited Vittoriosa in 1551,&lt;ref name="times1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalli|first1=Kim|title=When prostitution in a car was a crime... but not on boat|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20141019/local/When-prostitution-in-a-car-was-a-crime-but-not-on-boat.540238|website=Times of Malta|accessdate=23 February 2018|date=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Great Siege of Malta]] in 1565, arrangements were made to evacuate the country's prostitutes to [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name="bradford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradford|first1=Ernie|title=Siege Malta 1940-1943|date=2011|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781848845848|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SyTOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=prostitution+in+malta#v=onepage&amp;q=prostitution%20in%20malta&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Knights moved from Vittoriosa to the new capital [[Valletta]], the prostitutes followed. As the Knights took vows of [[chastity]], the prostitutes with them was seen as a scandal. Foreign prostitutes were expelled and the Maltese prostitutes confined to one area of the city.&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt; At the time prostitutes wore a white shirt tied under their bust and a white cape.&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt;

In 1608, [[Spanish Inquisition|inquisitor]] Leonetto della Cordoba was charged with seeking out prostitutes and dismissed as an inquisitor.&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt; Prostitution was also common on [[Gozo]].&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt;

Towards the 17th century, there was harsh prejudice and laws towards those who were found guilty or speak openly of being involved in [[LGBT rights in Malta|same-sex activity]]. English voyager and author [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]], writing in March 1616, says a Spanish soldier and a Maltese teenage boy were publicly burnt to [[ash|ashes]] for confessing to have practiced sodomy together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Melita Historica|last=Brincat|first=Joseph M.|title=Book reviews|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2007)4/07.pdf|date=2007|volume=14|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, and fear to similar faith, about a hundred males involved in [[Male prostitution|same-sex prostitution]] sailed to [[Sicily]] the following day.&lt;ref name="buttigieg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buttigieg|first=Emanuel|date=2011|title=Nobility, Faith and Masculinity: The Hospitaller Knights of Malta, c.1580-c.1700|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=DVqd_gb2tmMC&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=A &amp; C Black|isbn=9781441102430|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Diritto Municipale|a code introduced]] by [[List of Princes and Grand Masters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Grand Master]] [[António Manoel de Vilhena]] in 1724, married men of means were fined if found guilty of use of the service of a prostitute, and expelled from the country on the third conviction. Lower class men were whipped and sentenced to hard labour on the third offence. The 1784 code of [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]] barred foreign prostitutes entering the country and placed restrictions on Maltese prostitutes. They were not allow to open their doors between sunrise and sunset and were not allowed to enter pubs or taverns. Compulsory medical examinations were introduced.&lt;ref name="savona-ventura"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Savona-Ventura|first1=Charles|title=Contemporary Medicine in Malta [1798-1979]|date=2016|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781326648992|pages=76–78|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eMgkDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=prostitution+in+malta#v=onepage&amp;q=prostitution%20in%20malta&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French period===
[[File:Malta - Valletta - Triq San Bastjan - Auberge de Baviere 03 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Auberge de Bavière]] was a hospital for [[venereal disease]] in Valletta]]
Following the [[French occupation of Malta]], prostitution rose.&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt; Compulsory medical examinations continued&lt;ref name="savona-ventura" /&gt; and the authorities opened hospitals in the monastery of [[Scholastica|Saint Scholastica]] and in [[Auberge de Bavière]] to treat soldiers with [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]].&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Storja|last=Savona-Ventura|first=C.|date=1998|title=Human Suffering during the Maltese Insurrection of 1798|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Storja/Storja1998/06s.pdf|volume=3|issue=6|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British period===
After the country come under control of the [[Great Britain|British]], prostitution increased again due to the number of sailors and soldiers stationed there.&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt; Many married women became prostitutes with their husbands’ knowledge due to economic hardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Desmond|title=Malta, Britain, and the European Powers, 1793-1815|date=1996|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=9780838635902|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zSWuCsxS1QcC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=prostitution+in+malta#v=onepage&amp;q=prostitution%20in%20malta&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compulsory medical examinations continued until 1859 when it was realised that previous Grand Master codes were not legally enforceable. The prostitutes therefore refused to undergo the examinations.&lt;ref name="savona-ventura" /&gt; As a result, the authorities, under the guidance of Governor [[John Le Marchant (British Army officer, born 1803)|John Le Marchant]],&lt;ref name="times2" /&gt; decreed under Ordinance IV of 1861, that all prostitutes should be examined by a police doctor three times a month in an attempt to control the spread of STDs.&lt;ref name="times2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt; If an infection was discovered, the prostitute was taken to hospital and kept there until cured.&lt;ref name="times2" /&gt; This regulation in Malta was a great influence on Britain introducing the first of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] in 1864 and its subsequent extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Howell|first1=Philip|title=Prostitution and racialised sexuality: the regulation of prostitution in Britain and the British Empire before the Contagious Diseases Acts|publisher=University of Cambridge|date=7 April 1999|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.5799}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The frequency of examinations was increased to 4 times a month in 1920.&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt;

Although there were regulations to control STIs, there were no prostitution laws until 1898. A new law was introduced prohibiting brothels, and not more than one prostitute could live in the same house unless they registered with the police.&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt; The law also forbade prostitutes to live on the ground floor, within 50 yards of a place of worship or adjacent to licensed premises.&lt;ref name="times2" /&gt; In 1904 there were 152 registered prostitutes, although many more were unregistered.&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt;

Malta was known by British sailors as the 'place with the three Ps: pubs, priests and prostitutes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Andrew|title=The Rules of the Game: Jutland and British Naval Command|date=2015|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780141980331|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PfexBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT209&amp;lpg=PT209&amp;dq=%27place+with+the+three+Ps:+pubs,+priests+and+prostitutes#v=onepage&amp;q='place%20with%20the%20three%20Ps%3A%20pubs%2C%20priests%20and%20prostitutes&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Malta}}
Malta is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and children from Malta have also been subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Women from [[Southeast Asia]] working as domestic workers, [[China|Chinese]] nationals working in [[massage parlor]]s, and women from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]] working in nightclubs represent populations vulnerable to exploitation.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malta 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271238.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=23 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 248A-G of the criminal code prohibits both sex and labour trafficking and prescribes penalties of four to 12 years imprisonment. The government has not obtained a conviction since early 2012. The government conducted three investigations and initiated prosecution of four defendants in one case, which remained pending at the close of 2016. These efforts were on par with 2015 when the government initiated investigation of two cases and prosecution of two defendants. Both the appeal of a 2012 conviction of a police officer for alleged collusion with a trafficker, and the prosecution of a 2004 case involving a police official, remained pending. There were no new investigations or prosecutions of government employees complicit in human trafficking offences.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Malta as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1637">''' Rubens Farias Jr.''' (1954&amp;ndash; ) is a [[Brazil|Brazilian]] [[psychic surgeon]], who claims to be a channel for the spirit of [[Dr. Fritz]]. His clinic is in Bom Sucesso, a suburb of [[Rio de Janeiro]].

Rubens was trained as an [[engineer]]. 

He is not the first Brazilian to make the claim. He follows [[Zé Arigó]], who died in a car crash in 1971, and a string of other claimants. Farias began claiming [[reincarnation]] as early as 1986. On a typical weekday, as many as 800 patients will line up outside the hall he uses (on weekends, it serves as a bar), waiting for treatment sessions which might be as short as 30 seconds. While in character as Dr. Fritz, he adopts a German accent and expressions such as "[[German adverbial phrases#Adverbial forms of adjectives|Schnell]]!" In some cases, patients get a homemade injection, reportedly a mixture of [[alcohol]], [[iodine]] and [[turpentine]]. Medical hygiene is minimal.

The Regional Medical Council for the state of Rio de Janeiro labels Farias a "charlatan" taking advantage of the chaotic Brazilian public health system, and has sued to halt his activities.

In [[psychology]], education and [[social work]] practice, '''social role valorization''' ('''SRV''') is the name given to an analysis of human relationships and human services, formulated in 1983 by [[Wolf Wolfensberger]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1991). "A Brief Introduction to Social Role Valorization as a High-Order Concept for Structuring Human Services. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Training Institute on Human Services Planning, Leadership and Change Agentry.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1983). Social Role Valorization: A proposed new term for the principle of normalization. "Mental Retardation", 21(6): 234-239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1985). Social role valorization: A new insight, a new term, for normalization. "Australian Association for the Mentally Retarded Journal", 9(1): 4–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, S. &amp; Wolfensberger, W. (1999). An overview of social role valorization. In: R.J. Flynn &amp; R. A. LeMay, "A Quarter Century of Normalization and Social Role Valorization". Ottawa, Canada: University of Ottawa Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as the successor to his earlier formulation of the principle of [[Normalization (sociology)|normalization]] which is attributed to Nirje, Wolfensberger, and Bank-Mikkelsen worldwide (Lemay, 1995; Wolfensberger, 1972).&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1972). "The Principle of Normalization in Human Services". Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nirje, B. (1985). The basis and logic of the normalization principle. "Australian and New Zealand Journal of Developmental Disabilities", 17(2): 265-267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nirje, B. (1992). Bank-Mikkelsen: Founder of Normalization Principle. "News &amp; Notes", 5(2), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is based on the idea that society tends to identify groups of people as fundamentally 'different', and of less value than everyone else. It catalogs the methods of this 'devaluation' and analyzes its effects. It may be used by those seeking to counteract these methods and effects. A recent compilation of normalization and social role valorization was by Flynn and LeMay (1999); their work remains important today in Europe, New Zealand and Australia among other countries.

==Overview of normalization and social role valorization==
Although normalization and the initial versions of SRV were described as an 'Ideology', the most recent formulation explicitly denies that SRV is about what ''should'' be done, and reinforces that SRV is intended to be a tool for analysis of the process and effects of Societal Devaluation.  Wolfensberger's most recent (1999) definition of SRV is: "the application of what science can tell us about the enablement, establishment, enhancement, maintenance, and/or defence of valued social roles for people" (Susan Thomas and Wolf Wolfensberger in Flynn and Lemay 1999,  p.&amp;nbsp;125). Susan Thomas, long time professional educator with Wolfensberger, continues to teach through the Institute at Syracuse University as of 2012. University students and training institute colleagues can be found worldwide with many internationally seeking collaborative projects with the Wolfensberger (e.g., now Rannveig Traustadottir, now Gender and Disability Chair at the University of Iceland).

Social role valorization (SRV) is a  relationship theory of empirical knowledge for the design and rendering of formal and informal services and relationships to people with any need or condition, especially those who are devalued or are at risk.  Social role valorization is intended to address the social and psychological wounds that are inflicted on vulnerable people because they are devalued, that so often come to define their lives and that in some instances wreak lifelong havoc on those who are close to them.

SRV does not in itself propose a 'goal'.  However a person who has a goal of improving the lives of devalued people may choose to use insights gained from SRV to cause change.  They may do so by attempting to create or support socially valued roles for people in their society, because if a person holds valued social roles, a person is highly likely to receive from society those good things in life that are available or at least the opportunities for obtaining them. In other words, all sorts of good things that other people are able to convey are almost automatically apt to be accorded to a person who holds societally valued roles, at least within the resources and norms of his/her society.

Social role valorization identifies social devaluation as a critical human experience that has long-term effects on the individual.  SRV is designed to raise consciousness about the fate of socially devalued persons.  SRV holds that the human being is vulnerable to the regard of others for both the heights of edification and the depths of degradation.

An understanding of social role valorization can lead to ideas about how to improve the lives of people who are devalued by society. These can be seen to have two themes – firstly, removing devaluing features (for instance people being segregated from society in a building along with others perceived to belong to the same group), and secondly taking action that leads to people being valued. On one the approaches of SRV involves socially valued persons allying themselves with socially devalued persons. This alliance will unify people, broaden acceptance of differences, and encourage coexistence.

SRV is a realistic if not pessimistic sense of human behaviour, holding that human beings are imperfect and capable of great evils even if they are occasionally saintly, heroic or kind.

Social role valorization is designed to address the social and psychological wounds that get inflicted on vulnerable people because they are devalued, that so often come to define their lives, and that in some instances wreak lifelong havoc on them and those who are close and committed to them.

==Basic structure==
SRV is a description of how societally differentiated people are devalued, assigned low-value roles, and treated poorly, often to the extent of risk to their own lives. This poor treatment is given to members of any group that is given low value by powerful forces in society.

SRV considers only those things that can be known from a scientific perspective. In itself it does not subscribe to a particular ideology – it does not say what should be done and it does not say what is morally correct.

However, SRV does understand that human interaction is impossible without a moral code and so SRV can be used to suggest what is desirable given the spoken or unspoken moral code of a particular society or individual. Consequently, it is necessary to understand what sort of moral code and societal expectations might be around the implementation of any application of SRV. A consideration of the concepts of humanity and morality place SRV in an appropriate context.

Any particular human society will have a set of written and unwritten rules about who is a member of that society and about how members of that society should act, and what treatment is due to non-members of that society. These rules are often set down in codes of law and in religious texts. Every society has such a moral code.

Support for SRV can be found throughout the human sciences. Biology, evolutionary biology, sociology, economics, psychology, and anthropology all lend strands to SRV. Even history and geography have ideas to contribute. Although SRV is not in itself a science, it is based on empirically produced disciplines.

===Science in psychology, special education and philosophy===

Psychology and philosophy tell us that there is considerable doubt about the common sense idea that we have total free will; what we do is often societally or physically caused by unconscious mechanisms.

Science tells us that people do not often act as completely free-thinking individuals, but in fact occupy particular social strata and  roles that organize and simplify their social communication. Particular people may be forced into a negative role which they do not desire.

Science tells us that individuals and groups will place positive and negative values onto other individuals and groups. This assignation of value may lead to a process of devaluation.

Complex societal forces mediate the exercise of power and social control in a society. These forces are often not well understood by individuals in that society.

Individuals in a society are very aware of similarities and differences between members of that society. This is societal differentiation.

Such difference groups may include people with the following differences from the valued norm:
*People with mental difficulties (including those states labelled as mental illness and learning disability)
*People with physical capability differences (including those labelled as having difficulties with mobility, body control and bodily integrity)
*People with physical appearance differences (including those labelled as facially disfigured, unusual appearance, overweight or underweight)
*People perceived to be of a different ethnic or racial group
*People of different gender or sexuality
*People who are labelled criminals (whether legally or morally so or not)
*People who do not accept societal norms for whatever reason
*People who use drugs (including those who use alcohol and nicotine as well as those who use chemicals more usually called drugs in the society)
*People who exhibit lack of control according to the expectations of that society

Psychology shows us that perception and interpretation are complex subjects, highly reliant on beliefs and prejudices. Human perception and interpretation is complicated and often not in accord with what 'common sense' tells us that it is.

Learning and particularly imitation are the natural modes of behavior formation and are important in developing useful as well as damaging performances.

Image and image transfer are important subjects when considering how people interpret each other and their own surroundings.

Performance, reputation and grouping determine how people are seen and interpreted.

===Summary of relationship to theories of power, deviancy and role relations===

So, we may summarise: people who differ in any way from societal expectations or desirability, where this difference is negatively valued, will be badly treated by that society.

Powerful groups in society will:

*Define people as different
*Treat people with the same or similar differences as a group.
*If the difference is seen as negative, it will treat such groups badly.
*It will assign negative deviancy roles to such groups and people. (These deviancy roles include: not human (animal-like, plant-like, less than human, not yet human, used to be human, alien), waste, trivium (clown-like, humorously insignificant), threat, burden of charity, and death related roles.)

SRV suggests that role messages are largely conveyed by image, whether of the individual or of their surroundings (including accompanying people). A person's potential roles may be limited or assigned by the company they keep, the surroundings in which they live, or the activities they engage in.

SRV suggests that Role Occupancy is dependent on apparent competency in that role. So the availability of roles may be limited or assigned by the person's ability (or, more importantly, the lack of ability) to perform the necessary role requirements for the effective performance of that role.

====Effects related to role theories: good things and devaluation====
People cast into such negative roles will be denied the good things in life:

The good things in life:
*Family or small intimate group
*An intermediate but still small-scale group
*A transcendental belief system
*Absence of imminent threats of extreme privation
*To be viewed as a human and treated with respect
*To be treated justly
*Friends
*Work, especially meaningful work
*Opportunities and expectations to discover and develop skills, abilities, gifts and talents
*To be dealt with honestly
*To be treated as an individual
*Access to the 'sites of everyday life'
*Being able to contribute, and having ones contributions recognised as valuable

Further, such groups will be damaged in the following ways:

'Wounds' or bad things which happen to devalued persons:

*''Relegation'' to low ('deviant') status and rejection, perhaps by family, neighbours, community, society, service workers, leading to:
**Cast into one or more historical deviancy roles
**Symbolical stigmatising, 'marking', 'deviancy-imaging', 'branding'
**Being multiply jeopardised, scapegoated
**Distantiation: usually via segregation and also congregation
**Loss of control, perhaps even autonomy and freedom, leading to:
***Discontinuity with the physical environment and objects
***Social and relationship discontinuity, even abandonment
***Absence or loss of natural/freely given relationships, and substitution of artificial/'bought' ones
***Deindividualization, leading to:
****Involuntary material poverty, material/financial exploitation
****Impoverishment of experience, especially that of the typical, valued world
****Exclusion from knowledge of, and participation in, higher order value systems (e.g. religion) that give meaning and direction to life, and provide community
****Having one's life 'wasted'
****Being the object of brutalisation, 'killing thoughts', and death making

=====Other reactions to bad treatment=====

Additional mental and behavioral response patterns that are evidence of disturbed interactions with the world, and that are engendered by certain wounds and wound clusters, are:

*Feeling like being an alien in the world
*A sense of worthlessness, dislike of self, despair
*Insecurity
*Failure sets and avoidance mentalities
*Awareness of being a source of anguish to those who love one
*Searching for the abandoner
*Fantasy and inventions about relationships that do not exist, and may never have existed
*Seeking/demanding physical contact, perhaps insatiably
*Problematic testing of genuineness of personal and social relationships, particularly new ones
*Turning the hurt into resentment or hatred towards privileged people, benefactors, society, or God
*Withdrawing from human contact, perhaps even from reality
*Rage, perhaps violence
*A sapping of energy, both physical and mental, resulting in a lowering of intelligent behavior, and possibly even of intelligence

The coping mechanism is to avoid negative roles and outcomes:
*SRV suggests that in trying to avoid the above, it is most useful to seek positive valued roles for the devalued people and groups.
*SRV suggests that such role re-valorization may be considerably more effective than other means of assisting people in devalued states.
*Consequently, SRV suggests that enhancing competency and image (of the person and their surroundings) will result in positive roles being made a possibility for devalued people.
*If such positive roles are supported and defended, and further positive roles are sought and achieved, then the devalued person will be more likely to achieve more of the good things in life, and avoid the Wounds and other Negative Effects secondary to Devaluation.

=====Positive actions at different levels=====
In order to ensure that positive roles are available to persons who have been devalued by society, it is necessary to consider actions at multiple levels:

*The level of the person themselves (personal appearance and competency)
*The level of the usual immediate environment of the person (where they live, work, learn and play)
*The level of all the life arenas in which a person may engage (everywhere else they engage with society)
*The level of society itself (how one may effect political, legal and moral change regarding the devaluation of individuals)

SRV suggests that by these means, people who have been devalued by society may be rescued (or may rescue themselves) from the effects of devaluation, and may manage to live their lives occupying Valued Roles and become seen as valued by society. Other theories regarding "mentally handicapped" individuals include consciousness raising and implications for normalization from the women's movement, related self-advocacy movements in special education and rehabilitation, and now the new movement to community inclusion as represented at the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006).

==Criticisms==
{{POV section|date=August 2012}}
# SRV has had a lifespan of barely a generation even if taking into account its predecessor normalization (resulting in Nordic countries in the first integrated generation worldwide). According to one editor, this timeframe compared to the history of asylums, should give anyone pause in granting to it a permanency in societies which is still being established and solidified. History would predict a period of transinstitutionalization and retrenchment, and again further efforts to develop and promote and strengthen community. 
# SRV does not consistently raise consciousness and guarantee concern about socially devalued persons in part because it has a moral base in societies which are struggling with ethical concerns in government and administration. Ideologies cannot ultimately control the character of their adherents even though they are influential. Further, their theoretical value can be nullified if used wrongly. More often, theories such as SRV are analyzed and presented inaccurately by their opponents, and a real debate seldom is forthcoming.
# Not all alliances between socially valued and devalued persons are moral, fruitful and advantageous which follows the literature on attempts at co-optation of all civil rights movements.
# Knowing how social devaluation works in society may still leave one impotent against it. However, efforts at social valuations, in the context of positivism, can counteract for individuals and families the literature's "downward spiral".
# SRV's societal impact, thus far, is largely confined to several narrow human service fields.  In part, this factor is due to the insular nature of intellectual and developmental disabilities, and the categorical division of state agencies and delivery system.
# SRV is open to criticism because of the later politico-moral stance (Christian, right wing conservatism) of its founder, Wolf Wolfensberger, in which he advances a non-mainstream response to the plight of the wounded (his conceptual term) in society.  This response may be seen as anti-death (opposing all abortion and all forms of euthanasia), morally conservative, anti-bourgeoise feminist (stressing the 'importance' of motherhood rather than parenthood, and persistently relegating women to subsidiary power roles), homophobic, anti psychiatry and religiose. 
This criticism appears unjust in that Wolfensberger is an early proponent of the rights of people with mental retardation to marry, while other professionals placed the same individuals in institutional abuse and confinement. His doctoral students hold leadership positions in gender and disability, and he is associated with liberals in his own academic department who support actions in that context to address entrenched societal discrimination.
# Although Wolf Wolfensberger attempts to isolate SRV from his underlying beliefs, SRV may be negatively affected by this association for those whom disagree with these moral and religious positions (which of course, include a decade of students and colleagues as well). Reference to the series of Pamphlets entitled 'TIPS' and edited by Wolf Wolfensberger provides graphic evidence of the politico-moral stance of the lead proponents of SRV. This criticism has resulted in liberals and moderates involved in broader discrimination movements (e.g., gay civil unions, Black &amp; Grey Panthers, Red and Pink Hat Societies) to limit the involvement of SRV adherents in their work.
# SRV, with roots in normalization and related citizen advocacy, supports unpaid relationships, giving, volunteerism, life commitments, and commitments to new approaches to shared living, including the co-residency model and the L'Arche communities. 
It can be suggested that all constructed attempts to re-valorize the roles and raise the social status of marginalised individuals and groups are hollow as they are artificial, but of course, government is responsible to provide minimum wage laws, to increase worker benefits, to maintain entitlements, to provide quality housing and beneficial and affordable health care. 
In other words, the person providing the re-valorization efforts such as a social worker or supported employment worker is paid to do his or her job, and is not helping the marginalised person out of genuine interpersonal motivation such as friendship, attraction or emotional attachment, and people are well aware of this monetary role in professions in human services. Therefore, any re-valorized role is viewed by those outside the relationship as non-genuine, unstable, though new evidence and theory (e.g., theories of social acceptance, versus deviance) suggests that beneficence and social acceptance are active and result in positive life outcomes. Thus, paid roles (sometimes preferred in modern life) would tend to negate the security-giving benefits that valued, familial and friendship roles would normally provide.

==Misconceptions==
Some criticism of social role valorization is said by its advocates to be because of misconceptions about it. Such misconceptions include:
* that the theory sees that some people have more value, and others less (the theory speaks about how people are valued by society, in the assumption that all actually have equal value),
* that social role valorization encourages action which supports the valuing of certain sections of society or behaviours (the theory actually encourages action that helps society to value groups previously 'devalued'),
* that social role valorization works against self-advocacy efforts by a group of devalued people (the theory describes how labelling and segregating people supports social devaluation, but says nothing to deny that good can come from groups identifying themselves as having common cause or as having experiences or cultures in common).

The theory of social role valorization is best understood as referring primarily to extreme devaluation (such that few people care much about what happens to an individual or group, or even actively look for their eradication) not more subtle (but still damaging) devaluation such as occurs between different social classes or between genders.

==Comparative community theories==
Social role valorization (SRV), similar to normalization, is a foundational theory with roots in intellectual and developmental disabilities, often termed learning disabilities in Europe. It is a revolutionary concept which took roots in the deinstitutionalization and community integration movements of the 1970s and 1980s which aligned themselves with its broad concepts and goals more so than with the specifics of the theory, goals and formulations itself. SRV and normalization adherents, in contrast, are committed first to the specific theories and have tended to be reluctant to engage in academic theoretical discussions with related theorists (e.g., independent and supportive living; support and empowerment paradigms; user-and-family directed services; self-determination and choice theories). In addition, other giants in community development such as Gunnar Dybwad, advisors to Presidents in the US, Brandeis University professor, friend of the Center on Human Policy, and former Arc-US director, often are missed in contrasting theory formulations.

SRV is supportive of the development of community paradigms (e.g., Schwartz, McKnight, O'Brien, Taylor, Racino, Wehman, Roberts, Towell, Lakin, Bruininks, Braddock, Hemp, Rogan, Anthony, Carling, Seekins, Condeluci &amp; Gretz-Lasky)&lt;ref&gt;Condeluci, A. &amp; Gretz-Lasky. (1987). Social role valorization: A model of community reentry. "Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation", 2(1): 49-56.&lt;/ref&gt; which were necessary to replace the institutional paradigms of the pre-expose era, however, with community paradigms taking over 20 years to become the mainstream academic publications. Today, new goals of integration, a basic principle of normalization, involve the integration of family studies to include families with a disability family member, integration of financing (e.g., housing and homes), long-term services and supports development (e.g., personal assistance, support aides for homes and families), and modernization to areas such as green and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2014). "Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US". New York, NY: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Research for ''Sofia's Last Ambulance'' started in 2008. During the research period, Metev met Dr Yordanov, who has been working in the emergency services for 23 years, and was fascinated by his humbleness and industry. Dr Yordanov and his two teammates were responsible for the most critical cases in the capital. The observational documentary was then shot over the period of two years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Young|first=Neil|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/sofias-last-ambulance-cannes-review-329993|title=Sofia's Last Ambulance: Cannes Review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=2012-06-16|date=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the shooting crew consisting of Metev and sound recordist Tom Kirk planted in the back of the ambulance, trying to be as discrete and invisible as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Petrov|first=Nikola|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=139887|title=Bulgarian Director Ilian Metev: 'Sofia's Last Ambulance' Can Inspire Change|work=[[Novinite]]|accessdate=2012-06-17|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film was a co-produced in association with German television channel [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]], German/French channel [[Arte]], American equity fund [[Impact Partners]], [[Bulgarian National Film Center]], the [[Croatian Audiovisual Centre]] and the German [[Film und Medienstiftung NRW]].

==Reception==
''Sofia's Last Ambulance'' premiered at the 51st [[International Critics' Week]] in [[Cannes]]. The [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] wrote that "after the screening filmmakers and protagonists were in tears. Number of spectators also."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nice.maville.com/actu/actudet_-Sofia-s-last-ambulance-le-quotidien-sur-le-fil-de-secouristes-bulgares_fil-2159412_actu.Htm|title=Documentaire - "Sofia's last ambulance": le quotidien, sur le fil, de secouristes bulgares|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|accessdate=2012-07-28|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Weissberg of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as "rigidly constructed and deeply human" and Julien Gester of ''[[Liberation (newspaper)|Liberation]]'' called it a "fine and strong investigation of a state of crisis."{{fact|date=October 2017}}

==Social impact==
At the premiere of the film in Sofia, the Bulgarian health minister [[Desislava Atanasova]] admitted that "Sofia's Last Ambulance reflects the reality of things" and pronounced that since the film, two new emergency response units have been opened up in the capital to speed up response times; ambulance crews' wages were to be increased by 18%. Protagonist and emergency doctor Krassimir Yordanov criticized that these reforms were insufficient to address the true cause of the problems: chronically low wages that makes medical professionals leave in droves. Despite 25-years experience in the job, his monthly pay is "less than the weekly pay of any colleague in other European Union countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20121127-health-reforms-bulgaria-after-cannes-winning-film|title=Health reforms in Bulgaria after Cannes-winning film|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|accessdate=2013-01-20|date=27 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20625">rising from around forty-four years in 1949 to sixty-eight years in 1985. In addition, the percentage of the Chinese population estimated to be living in absolute poverty fell from between 200-270 million in 1978 to 70 million in 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;General Paradox by John Naisbitt&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the 1970s, the fruits of economic growth were largely negated by [[Demographics of China|population]] increases, which prevented significant advances in the [[per capita]] availability of food, clothing, and housing beyond levels achieved in the 1950s.

In 1978, the [[Communist Party of China]], under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]], began to introduce market reforms, including decollectivizing agriculture, allowing foreign investment and individual entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/90620/2/WP%2051.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; After thirty years of austerity and marginal sufficiency, Chinese consumers suddenly were able to buy more than enough to eat from a growing variety of food items. Stylish clothing, modern furniture, and a wide array of electrical appliances also became part of the normal expectations of ordinary Chinese families.

Following the economic reforms introduced by the government in the late 1970s, consumption and individual incomes rose significantly, with the real per capita consumption of peasants rising at an annual rate of 6.7% from 1975 to 1986, while for urbanites over the same period, the corresponding figure was 5.5%. The improvements in the standard of living were demonstrated by a boom in rural and urban housing, together with a considerable increase in the ownership of televisions and other appliances.&lt;ref&gt;Driven by Growth: Political Change in the Asia-Pacific Region edited by James W. Morley&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
While food production rose substantially after 1949, population increases were nearly as great until the 1980s. Production of grain, the source of about 75 percent of the [[calories]] in the [[Chinese diet]], grew at an average rate of 2.7 percent a year between 1952 and 1979, while population growth averaged almost 2 percent a year. Total [[grain]] output per capita grew from 288 kilograms a year in 1952 to 319 kilograms in 1978, an increase of only 11 percent in 26 years. In 1984, however, a remarkably good [[harvest]] produced 396 kilograms of grain per capita, an increase of 24 percent in only 6 years. In 1985 grain output fell below the peak level of 1984, to 365 kilograms per person, and recovered only partially in 1986 to 369 kilograms per capita.

==Clothing==
In the 1970s before the reform period, [[clothing]] purchases were restricted by rationing. [[Cotton]] cloth consumption was limited to between four and six meters a year per person. In the 1980s one of the most visible signs of the economic "revolution" was the appearance in [[Chinese cities]] of large quantities of relatively modern, varied, colorful clothes, a sharp contrast to the monotone image of blue and gray suits that typified Chinese dress in earlier years. Cloth consumption increased from eight meters per person in 1978 to almost twelve meters in 1985, and [[rationing]] was ended in the early 1980s. Production of [[synthetic fiber]]s more than tripled during this period; in 1985 synthetics constituted 40 percent of the cloth purchased. Consumers also tripled their purchases of [[wool]]en [[fabric]]s in these years and bought growing numbers of [[garment]]s made of [[silk]], [[leather]], or [[down feather|down]]. In 1987 Chinese [[department store]]s and [[street market]]s carried clothing in a large variety of styles, colors, quality, and prices. Many people displayed their new [[affluence]] with relatively expensive and stylish clothes, while those with more modest tastes or meager incomes still could adequately outfit themselves at very low cost.

==Consumer goods==
As with food supplies and clothing, the availability of [[houseware]]s went through several stages. Simple, inexpensive household items, like [[thermos]]es, cooking pans, and clocks were stocked in department stores and other [[retail]] outlets all over China from the 1950s on. Relatively expensive consumer [[durables]] became available more gradually. In the 1960s production and sales of bicycles, sewing machines, wristwatches, and transistor radios grew to the point that these items became common household possessions, followed in the late 1970s by television sets and cameras. In the 1980s supplies of furniture and electrical appliances increased along with family incomes. Household survey data indicated that by 1985 most urban families owned two bicycles, at least one sofa, a writing desk, a wardrobe, a sewing machine, an electric fan, a radio, and a television. Virtually all urban adults owned wristwatches, half of all families had washing machines, 10 percent had refrigerators, and over 18 percent owned color televisions. Rural households on average owned about half the number of consumer durables owned by urban dwellers. Most farm families had 1 bicycle, about half had a radio, 43 percent owned a sewing machine, 12 percent had a television set, and about half the rural adults owned wristwatches.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Housing==
[[Dwellings|Housing]] [[construction]]  lagged behind urban population growth. A 1978 survey of housing conditions in 192 cities found that their combined population had increased by 83 percent between 1949 and 1978, but housing floor space had only grown by 46.7 percent. In 1978 there were only 3.6 square meters of living space per inhabitant in these cities, a reduction of 0.9 square meter since 1949. To remedy this problem, construction of modern urban housing became a top priority in the late 1970s, and by the mid-1980s new high-rise apartment blocks and the tall cranes used in their construction were ubiquitous features of large cities. Some apartments in the new buildings had their own lavatories, kitchens, and balconies, but others shared [[communal]] facilities. Nearly all were of much higher quality than older houses, many of which were built of mud bricks and lacked [[plumbing]].

By 1981 living space in urban housing had increased to 5.3 square meters per person, and by 1985 the figure was 6.7 square meters. Despite this progress, scarcity of housing continued to be a major problem in the cities, and many young married couples had to live with parents or make do with a single room.
Housing conditions in rural areas varied widely. During the 1960s and 1970s, thousands of production brigades built sturdy, sanitary houses and apartments and in many cases entire new villages. With the introduction of the [[responsibility system]] and the more than doubling of rural incomes in the early 1980s, another wave of housing construction took place as farm families moved quickly to invest in their major personal assets - their homes - which for the most part were privately owned. Many farm family houses lacked running water, but virtually all had electricity and were considerably more spacious than urban dwellings. In 1980 farm homes averaged 9.4 square meters of living space per person, and by 1985 the figure had risen to 14.7 square meters. Despite extensive construction of new housing, in poorer regions some farm families still lived in traditional dwellings, such as mud-brick and thatch houses or, in some regions, cave houses. Many of the [[nomad]]ic herders in [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Xinjiang]], and [[Xizang]] (Tibet) autonomous regions still lived in tents or felt yurts. In the [[Yangtze River Valley]] and in south China, some fishing and boat transportation communities continued to live on their vessels.

Since the 1990s there has been an increasing number of apartment built in China which remain empty.  By 2010 approximately 65 million apartments, capable of housing some 250 million people, were unoccupied, due to there being too expensive for the majority of Chinese to purchase or rent. At the same time many millions of urban Chinese remained living in slums. But, as the urbanization rate in China remains high (approx. 20 million Chinese move from rural areas each year&lt;ref&gt;[[Urbanization in China]]&lt;/ref&gt;) this problem is not severe and many so-called "ghost cities" become inhabited. As for 2012, there is 35 sq.meters per person in average and construction rate exceeds 1.5 sq. meters per year which allows total living area to exceed 50 sq. meters per capital as soon as in the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2013/indexeh.htm|title=China Statistical Yearbook 2013|author=|date=|website=www.stats.gov.cn|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Income distribution==
{{further|Income inequality metrics}}
[[Income]] differences in China since the 1950s have been much smaller than in most other countries. There was never any attempt, however, at complete equalization, and a wide range of income levels remained. Income differences grew even wider in the 1980s as the economic reform policies opened up new income opportunities. More than two-thirds of all urban workers were employed in state-owned units, which used an eight-grade [[wage]] system. The pay for each grade differed from one industry to another, but generally workers in the most senior grades earned about three times as much as beginning workers, senior managers could earn half again as much as senior workers, and engineers could earn twice as much as senior workers. In 1985 the average annual income of people employed in state-owned units was ¥1,213. An important component of workers' pay was made up of bonuses and subsidies. In 1985 bonuses contributed 13 percent of the incomes of workers in state-owned units; subsidies for transportation, food, and clothing added another 15 percent. One of the most important subsidies - one that did not appear in the income figures - was for housing, nearly all of which was owned and allocated by the [[work unit]] and rented to unit members at prices well below real value. In 1985 urban consumers spent just over 1 percent of their incomes on housing.

The ''Chinese Customer Report 2010'' states three groups of spending tiers of income: big spenders (which spend 21% of the income), medium spenders (which spend 36% of the income) and small spenders  (which spend 43% of the income).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolandberger.at/media/pdf/Roland_Berger_think_act_Chinese_Consumer_Report_20100723.pdf Short Chinese Customer Report 2010], [[Charles-Edouard Bouée]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The 27 percent of the urban labor force that was employed in collectively owned enterprises earned less on average than workers in state-owned units. The income of workers in collectively owned enterprises consisted of a share of the profit earned by the enterprise. Most such enterprises were small, had little [[Capital (economics)|capital]], and did not earn large [[Profit (economics)|profits]]. Many were engaged in traditional services, handicrafts, or small-scale, part-time assembly work. In 1985 workers in urban collective units earned an average annual income of ¥968. In the more open commercial environment of the 1980s, a small but significant number of people earned incomes much larger than those in regular state-owned and collectively owned units. Employees of enterprises run by [[overseas Chinese]], for instance, earned an average of ¥2,437 in 1985, over twice the average income of workers in state-owned units.

The small but dynamic domestic [[private sector]] also produced some lucrative opportunities. Private, part-time schools, which appeared in large numbers in the mid-1980s, offered [[wiktionary:moonlighting|moonlighting]] work to university professors, who could double or triple their modest incomes if they were from prestigious institutions and taught desirable subjects, such as [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or [[electronics]]. Small-scale entrepreneurs could earn considerably more in the free markets than the average income. Business people who served as a liaison between foreign firms and the domestic economy could earn incomes many times higher than those of the best-paid employees of state-owned units. A handful of [[millionaire]] [[businessmen]] could be found in the biggest cities. These people had owned firms before 1949, cooperated with the government in the 1950s in return for stock in their firms, and then lost their incomes in the political turmoil of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when these businessmen were politically rehabilitated, their incomes were returned with the accrued interest, and some suddenly found themselves quite wealthy. Although the number of people earning incomes far beyond the normal wage scale was tiny relative to the population, they were important symbols of the rewards of economic reform and received a great deal of media attention. In 1985 most of these people worked in enterprises classified as "units of other ownership" (private rather than state- or collectively owned enterprises). These enterprises employed only 440,000 people out of the total urban labor force of 128 million in 1985 and paid average annual salaries of ¥1,373, only slightly higher than the overall urban national average.

In China, as in other countries, an important determinant of the affluence of a household was the [[dependency ratio]] - the number of nonworkers supported by each worker. In 1985 the average cost of living for one person in urban areas was ¥732 a year, and the average state enterprise worker, even with food allowance and other benefits added to the basic wage, had difficulty supporting one other person. Two average wage earners, however, could easily support one dependent. Families with several workers and few or no dependents had substantial surplus [[earnings]], which they saved or used to buy nonessential goods. An important positive influence on the per capita [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] levels of urban families was a decline in the number of dependents per urban worker, from 2.4 in 1964 to 0.7 in 1985. In farm families the dependency ratio fell from 1.5 in 1978 to 0.7 in 1985. Farm incomes rose rapidly in the 1980s under the stimulus of the [[responsibility system]] but on average remained considerably lower than urban incomes. Household surveys found that in 1985 average net per capita income for rural residents was ¥398, less than half the average per capita urban income, which was ¥821. The value of goods farmers produced and consumed themselves accounted for 31 percent of rural income in 1985. The largest component of [[income in kind]] was food, 58 percent of which was self-produced.

Farm family members on average consumed much less of most major kinds of goods than urban residents. For instance, a household survey found in 1985 that the average urban dweller consumed 148 kilograms of [[vegetable]]s, 20 kilograms of [[meat]], 2.6 kilograms of [[sugar]], and 8 kilograms of [[liquor]]. At the same time, a survey of rural households found that the average rural resident consumed 131 kilograms of vegetables, 11 kilograms of meat, 1.5 kilograms of sugar, and 4 kilograms of liquor. Differences of a similar nature existed for consumer [[durables]].

Another indication of the gap between urban and rural income levels was the difference in personal [[savings]] accounts, which in 1985 averaged ¥277 per capita for urban residents but only ¥85 per capita for the rural population. There was great variation in rural income levels among different provincial-level units, counties, towns, villages, and individual families. While the average net per capita income for rural residents in 1985 was ¥398, provincial-level averages ranged from a high of ¥805 for farm families living in [[Shanghai]] to a low of ¥255 for the rural population of [[Gansu]] Province.

The fundamental influence on rural prosperity was [[Geography of China|geography]]. Soil type and quality, rainfall, temperature range, drainage, and availability of water determined the kinds and quantities of crops that could be grown. Equally important geographic factors were access to transportation routes and proximity to urban areas.

The highest agricultural incomes were earned by suburban units that were able to sell produce and sideline products in the nearby cities. Under the responsibility system, household incomes depended on the number of workers in each household and the household's success in holding down production costs and in supplying goods and services to local markets. Most of the rural families with the highest incomes - the "10,000-yuan households" - were "specialized households" that concentrated family efforts on supplying a particular service or good. Many of these families owned their own equipment, such as trucks or specialized buildings, and operated essentially as private concerns. An increasingly important influence on rural incomes in the mid-1980s was the expansion of nonagricultural rural enterprises, often referred to as "township enterprises." These were factories, construction teams, and processing operations, most of which were owned by [[collectives]], primarily villages, towns, and townships. Some were owned by voluntary groups of families. Township enterprises were considered by the government to be the main source of employment for rural workers who were leaving agriculture because of rising productivity under the responsibility system. By the end of 1986, township enterprises employed 21 percent of the rural labor force. The movement of rural labor into township enterprises helped to increase average rural incomes because of the higher [[productivity]] in nonagricultural jobs. In 1986 industrial workers in rural areas produced an average annual value of ¥4,300 per person, compared with about ¥1,000 per farmer in the same year.

The change in farm production from primarily collective to primarily household operations is reflected in household survey data on the sources of rural incomes. Before the 1980s farmers received income in the form of shares of the profits earned by their production teams plus supplementary income from household sideline activities. In 1978 two-thirds of the net income of farm families came from the collective, and only 27 percent was derived from household production. With the shift to the responsibility system these ratios were reversed. By 1982 the collective provided only 21 percent of farm income, while household production provided 69 percent. In 1985 the collective share of farm income had fallen to just over 8 percent, and the family production share had risen to 81 percent.

Perhaps the most serious gaps in living standards between rural and urban areas were in [[Education in China|education]] and [[Health in China|health care]]. Primary schools existed in most rural localities, and 80 percent of the country's primary-school teachers worked in rural schools. Secondary schools were less widely distributed; only 57 percent of the total number of secondary-school teachers served in rural schools. Most rural schools were less well equipped, and their staffs less adequately trained than their urban counterparts. Health care had been greatly improved in rural areas in the 1960s and 1970s through sanitation campaigns and the introduction of large numbers of [[barefoot doctor]]s, midwives, and health workers. Most modern hospitals, fully trained doctors, and modern medical equipment, however, were located in urban areas and were not easily accessible to rural families. In 1985 two-thirds of all hospital beds and medical staff personnel were located in urban hospitals. The economic reforms affected rural education and health care positively in places where farm communities used their higher incomes to improve schools and hospitals and negatively in localities where the reduced role of the collective resulted in deterioration of collective services.

A '''vaginal delivery''' is the [[birth]] of [[offspring]] ([[baby|babies]] in humans) in [[mammals]] through the [[vagina]]. It is the natural method of birth for all mammals except [[monotremes]], which lay eggs into the external environment. The average length of a hospital stay for a normal vaginal delivery is 36–48 hours or with an [[episiotomy]] (a surgical cut to widen the vaginal canal) 48–60 hours, whereas a [[C-section]] is 72–108 hours.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Different types of vaginal deliveries have different terms:

* A '''spontaneous vaginal delivery''' ('''SVD''') occurs when a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] [[female]] goes into [[childbirth|labor]] without the use of drugs or techniques to induce labor, and delivers her baby in the normal manner, without [[forceps]], [[Ventouse|vacuum extraction]], or a [[cesarean section]].
* An '''assisted vaginal delivery''' ('''AVD''') or '''instrumental vaginal delivery''' occurs when a pregnant female goes into labor (with or without the use of drugs or techniques to induce labor), and requires the use of special instruments such as forceps or a vacuum extractor to deliver her baby vaginally.
* An '''induced vaginal delivery''' is a delivery involving [[labor induction]], where [[drugs]] or manual techniques are used to initiate the process of labor. Use of the term "IVD" in this context is less common than for instrumental vaginal delivery.
* A '''normal vaginal delivery''' ('''NVD''') is a vaginal delivery, whether or not assisted or induced, usually used in statistics or studies to contrast with a delivery by cesarean section.

Note: Use of the term '''IVD''' for instrumental vaginal delivery is best avoided because of its duplicate meanings.

'''Victor Gomoiu''' (April 18, 1882 – February 6, 1960) was a [[Romania]]n surgeon, anatomist, folklorist and medical historian, who served as [[Ministry of Health (Romania)|Minister of Health and Social Protection]] in 1940. Noted before 1910 for his work in descriptive surgery and [[pathology]], focusing on the treatment of tuberculosis, genital diseases and tumors, he soon became one of the main contributors to medical historiography and bibliography. He founded several hospitals and edited medical journals, setting up a collection of medical instruments which became the basis of a national museum in [[Craiova]]. He became a professor at the [[University of Bucharest]], an expert for the [[League of Nations]], and, after distinguished service in World War I, a recipient of the [[Legion of Honor]]; additionally, he served for 22 years as president of the [[International Society for the History of Medicine]], of which his wife Viorica was also an active member.

A protegé of [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Queen Helen]] and administrator of her [[Brâncovenesc Hospital]], Gomoiu fell out with [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], and was arrested in 1934 for protesting against his rule. He returned to serve in two consecutive far-right governments, but, during World War II, emerged as a protector of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jews]], denouncing the policy of deportations to [[Transnistria Governorate|Transnistria]]. Despite this stance and his international profile, Gomoiu was arrested by the postwar [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], and spent time in confinement at [[Sighet prison|Sighet]] and [[Aiud prison|Aiud]]. He had been posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] by the 1980s, but his work was only fully recovered after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].

==Biography==

===Early life and work===
Born in [[Vânju Mare]], [[Mehedinți County]], he was the first child of [[Romanian Orthodox]] priest Gheorghe and his wife Ana.&lt;ref name="ist"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://liceuldrvictorgomoiu.info/dr-victor-gomoiu/ Dr. Victor Gomoiu (1882–1960)], at the Dr. Victor Gomoiu Theoretical High School site&lt;/ref&gt; He attended primary school in his native village, followed by [[Traian National College|Traian High School]] in [[Turnu Severin]] from 1893 to 1900. Between 1900 and 1905, he studied at the medical faculty of the [[University of Bucharest]]. Meanwhile, he rose steadily through the hospital ranks, from extern at [[Colțea Hospital]] in 1903 to intern there in 1905 to apprentice doctor at Bucharest's central military hospital in 1910.&lt;ref name="aman"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://aman.ro/betawp/wp-content/uploads/personalitati/G/gomoiu%20victor%20medic.pdf "Gomoiu, Victor"], at the Alexandru and Aristia Aman County Library&lt;/ref&gt; Gomoiu was a disciple of anatomist [[Thoma Ionescu]]. Alongside [[Dimitrie Gerota]], [[Ernest Juvara]] and [[Victor Papilian]], he continued Ionescu's work in descriptive anatomy as well as, in some instances, [[physical anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp. 142, 374–380&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, Gomoiu published in [[Bucharest]] the first volume of his ''Istoricul Societăței Studenților în Medicină'' ("History of the Medical Students' Society"), with a plate by [[Ary Murnu]]; also that year, his study on eye disease among the rural population saw print at [[Târgu Jiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al.'', pp. 502, 505–504&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliated with the left-wing agrarian current, or [[Poporanism]], he established in that city the literary magazine ''Șezătoarea Satului'' ("Village Sitting"), joining an editorial office which also included [[George Coșbuc]] and G. Dumitrescu Bumbești-Jiu.&lt;ref name="cșoltean"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cornel Șomâcu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140307221310/http://www.verticalonline.ro/victor-gomoiu-un-oltean-cu-merite-deosebite-in-medicina "Victor Gomoiu, un oltean cu merite deosebite în medicină"], in ''Vertical Online'', October 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He took his first trip outside the country in 1908, visiting states from [[Austria-Hungary]] to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="vs19"&gt;Sârbu, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomoiu published steadily, and also lectured at the Medical Students' Society and the Surgical Society. Topics included [[meningoencephalitis]], [[cerebral atrophy]], [[facial nerve paralysis]], [[fibrous tissue neoplasm]], [[lipoma]], the anatomy of the [[endothelium]], [[corneal transplantation]], [[skin grafting]], [[dental implant]]s, [[hysterectomy]], various types of cysts and "rare tumors", and [[talus bone]] expulsion. These works were taken up in [[Eraclie Sterian]]'s magazine, ''Spitalul'', of which Gomoiu was co-editor,&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; or published as brochures.&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al.'', pp. 502–505&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral thesis, on facial [[anaplasia]], was awarded a ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;Sârbu, p. 19; Tricot, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; and published the same year. It was followed in 1910 by Gomoiu's introduction to [[inguinal hernia surgery]], his reviews of surgery as applied to genital tuberculosis, vaginal [[hydrocele]], [[urethrocele]], and [[varicocele]], and a work on the physiological role of [[cholesterol]].&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al.'', pp. 501–504&lt;/ref&gt; A winner of the [[Manoah Hillel]] scholarship, that year and the next also saw his first contributions as a medical bibliographer and librarian, with catalogues of entries for the Bucharest University graduation papers in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Sârbu, p. 19; Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; For his service in the [[Romanian Army]], Gomoiu was concentrated in [[Medgidia]].&lt;ref name="vs19"/&gt;

Gomoiu soon lost his father to [[pancreatic cancer]] and found it hard to provide for himself, accepting jobs for which he was overqualified.&lt;ref name="vs19"/&gt; In March 1911, recommended by [[Francisc Rainer]], he began working as a surgical docent and became director of the [[Techirghiol]] tuberculosis sanatorium. He modernized the institution, systematizing records, constructing a laboratory, planting a grove of [[cluster pine]]s, and furnishing a small facility for the study of regional [[climatology]] and [[radioactivity]]. He also began experimenting with [[thalassotherapy]], [[light therapy]], and the use of [[medicinal clay]].&lt;ref&gt;Sârbu, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; This inaugurated a ten-year practice at various hospitals, during which Gomoiu patented various new surgical techniques.&lt;ref name="jpt115"&gt;Tricot, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; In November, after a disagreement with medical inspector Gheorghe Proca, who suggested that the sanatorium was unhygienic, Gomoiu handed in his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Sârbu, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, a second-class surgeon at [[Filantropia Hospital]], Gomoiu published a piece on "the radical treatment of vaginal hydrocele" in the French journal ''Lyon Chirurgical'', and his opening lesson on "small surgery" (''Mica chirurgie'').&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al503"&gt;Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he also performed his military obligation by accompanying the ambulatory health service sent to the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Second Balkan War]] and performing surgery within the unit.&lt;ref name="ist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt; In parallel, he studied [[craniometry]], publishing a study of 24 craniums in ''Revista Științelor Medicale'', then as a booklet, and following up in 1915 with ''Cercetări asupra perimetrului cranian'' ("Researching the Cranial Perimeter"). The same years saw his many conferences at the Surgical Society printed in several editions, alongside separate studies of [[skin cancer]], the [[sympathetic nervous system]] in the abdomen, [[gas gangrene]] of the thorax, and [[gastrostomy]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al.'', pp. 502–503, 505&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, he and Ionescu together discovered the link between [[stellate ganglion]] removal and [[sympathectomy]].&lt;ref&gt;O. Buda, "Thoma Ionescu (1860–1926): 150 de ani de la naștere", in ''Chirurgia'', Issue 3, 2010, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to prominence===
For his work as a military physician during the [[Romania in World War I|Romanian Campaign of World War I]], Gomoiu was decorated with the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown]] (1917), the [[Order of the Star of Romania]] (1918), and the [[Queen Marie Cross]] (1919).&lt;ref name="ist"/&gt; He subsequently served terms as head of the Union of Reserve Officers,&lt;ref name="cșoltean"/&gt; and, in 1920–1921, was curator (or ''efor'') of Bucharest's civilian hospitals.&lt;ref name="jpt115"/&gt; The author of ''Hommage a la France et aux médecins français'' ("A Homage to France and French Physicians", 1918),&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al503"/&gt; Gomoiu was made a chevalier of the [[Legion of Honor]] in 1922.&lt;ref name="ci"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cicerone Ionițoiu]], [http://www.procesulcomunismului.com/marturii/fonduri/ioanitoiu/dictionar_fg/g/dictionarg_25.pdf "Victimele terorii comuniste. Arestați, torturați, întemnițați, uciși. Dicționar G"]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1919 and 1942, he was a surgeon at the [[Oradea]] war hospital and at two hospitals in Bucharest, also working at [[Brâncovenesc Hospital]]. Meanwhile, he held various leadership roles in medical societies and administrative bodies,&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt; and, in 1921, became a professor at Bucharest University.&lt;ref name="ci"/&gt;

[[File:Gomoiu &amp; staff 1930.png|thumb|320px|Secretary General Gomoiu (in surgeon's uniform) with staff of the [[Ministry of Health (Romania)|Ministry of Health]] mechanical workshops, 1930]]
His work now included tracts in social medicine, the history of medicine and medical education. In 1923, he published the volume ''Din istoria medicinei și învățământului medical în România'' ("Briefs on the History of Medicine and Medical History in Romania"), followed in 1927 by ''Preoțimea în slujba operelor de ocrotire și medicină socială'' ("Priesthood in Service of Medical Care and Social Medicine").&lt;ref&gt;[[Gheorghe Banu]], ''Tratat de medicină socială. Volumul 1. Medicina socială ca știință. Eugenia. Demografia'', p. 43. Bucharest: Casa Școalelor, 1944. See also Bănescu, pp. 2–3; Riga &amp; Călin, p. 525; Tricot, pp. 116, 120&lt;/ref&gt; The former essay, reissued in 1940 as ''Biserica și medicina'' ("Church and Medical Science"), showed Gomoiu as a [[Deism|deist]], philosophically inspired by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]].&lt;ref&gt;Bănescu, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The work, which suggested that priests could work as "doctors of the soul", earned him a special prize from the [[Ministry of Health (Romania)|Ministry of Health]], led at the time by the priest [[Ioan Lupaș]].&lt;ref&gt;Bănescu, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomoiu also issued ''Istoricul presei medicale din România'' ("A History of Romania's Medical Press", 1925), and the second volume of ''Istoricul Societăței Studenților'' (1926).&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, p. 525&lt;/ref&gt; His first contacts with the [[International Society for the History of Medicine]] (ISHM) came in 1927 and 1928, when he sent in presentations on the first physicians active in the [[Danubian Principalities]] and the roots of Romanian [[ethnomedicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Tricot, pp. 116, 117, 120&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1927, on a visit to northern Europe, Gomoiu was impressed by [[Education in Denmark|Danish education]]. His article covering Danish libraries, and in particular the one [[Kunsthallen Nikolaj|Nikolaj Tower]], saw print in ''[[Cuvântul]]'' daily and was also taken up in ''Școala Noastră''.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. V. Gomoiu, "Mijloace de civilizație — la alții", in ''Școala Noastră'', Nr. 19–20/1927, pp. 535–537&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomoiu also became a trusted supporter of [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]], managing the charity set up by his daughter, [[Princess Ileana of Romania|Princess Ileana]].&lt;ref&gt;Tricot, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the specialists who assisted Ferdinand during his losing battle with [[colorectal cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], ''Memorii. Vol. V: Agonia regală și regența'', p. 161. Bucharest: [[Editura Naționala S. Ciornei]], 1939&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, under Ileana's patronage,&lt;ref name="jpt116"&gt;Tricot, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; he set up the Sfânta Elena Hospital, in the working-class suburb of Bariera Vergului, Bucharest. He personally oversaw the pledge drive, collecting private donations and public money from the [[National Bank of Romania|National Bank]], the Ministry of Health and [[Căile Ferate Române]], offering free medical services to the donors.&lt;ref name="cșoltean"/&gt; Gomoiu also designed much of the building, modifying sketches by the architect Gheorghe Șimotta. In the end, the hospital developed into a regional model, being cited as such in [[League of Nations]] reports.&lt;ref name="cșoltean"/&gt;

Together with his friend [[Mihai Cănciulescu]], Gomoiu edited ''Acta Medica Romana'' magazine from 1928 to 1948. There, the two led a sustained campaign for the establishment of a university at [[Craiova]],&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt; and also contributed to the establishment of regional hospitals in Vânju Mare, Turnu Severin, and [[Mangalia]].&lt;ref name="cșoltean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vs19"/&gt; Considered a founder of medical history and museography in Romania, Gomoiu collected old publications, diplomas, decrees, instruments and medical or pharmaceutical apparatus. He founded the ISHN-affiliated Romanian Medical History Society, which held monthly meetings from 1929 to 1948&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt; and was also placed under Princess Ileana's patronage.&lt;ref name="jpt116"/&gt; With his wife Viorica, herself a physician, Gomoiu organized and hosted the ISHM's September 1932 congress in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;"La bonne besogne du Congrés de Bucarest", in ''Revue d'Histoire de la Pharmacie'', Vol. 20, Issue 80, 1932, pp. 199–200; Constantin Bacaloglu, "Al IX-lea congres internațional al Istoriei Medicinei", in ''Cele Trei Crișuri'', Issues 9–10/1932, pp. 93–94; Viorica Gomoiu, Eugène-Humbert Guitard, "Les divers courants qui ont animé la pharmacie roumaine", in ''Revue d'Histoire de la Pharmacie'', Vol. 55, Issue 192, 1967, p. 371; Sârbu, p. 19; Tricot, pp. 116, 117&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while in 1930, Gomoiu served as secretary general in the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name="ci"/&gt;&lt;ref name="farez"&gt;Paul Farez, "Causerie medicale. Une cité moderne", in ''[[Journal des Débats]]'', No. 165/1930, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he attended a conference on social hygiene in the French industrial hub of [[Tergnier]], meeting with the organizer, [[Raoul Dautry]].&lt;ref name="farez"/&gt; He also represented Romania on the League of Nations committee for physical education, inspecting the military school at [[Joinville-le-Pont]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sports. Une enquête sur l'education sportive", in ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', June 12, 1930, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; After losing his government office, he returned to the ISHM and, in 1933, was elected its Vice President.&lt;ref name="jpt116"/&gt;

[[File:Gomoiu Cele Trei Crișuri 9–10 1932.png|thumb|220px|Gomoiu, photographed ca. 1932]]
Gomoiu also served as private physician to [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Queen Helen]],&lt;ref name="ci"/&gt; estranged wife of the new king, [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]. Around 1933, she also appointed him to lead her charity, ''Așezămintele Brâncovenești''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Hérissay, "Visions de Roumanie. VII. Préventoria de la montagne", in ''[[La Croix]]'', September 5, 1933, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; During this perod of his wife, Gomoiu emerged as "one of the best known critics of [Carol's] ''[[camarilla]]''".&lt;ref name="pțcamar197"&gt;Petre Țurlea, "România sub stăpânirea Camarilei Regale (1930–1940) (III)", in ''Analele Universității Creștine Dimitrie Cantemir. Seria Istorie'', Vol. 2, Issues 1–2, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; In March–April 1934, Gomoiu created a stir by publishing a manifesto against Carol and his circle of politicians. He was briefly arrested on charges of ''[[lèse-majesté]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Nouvelles de l'Étranger. Roumanie: Après l'arrestation du professeur Gomoiu", in ''[[Journal des Débats]]'', No. 85/1934, p. 2; "Nouvelles de l'Étranger. Roumanie: Après le complot de Bucarest", in ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', April 16, 1934, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; alongside far-right politicians suspected of having conspired with the [[Iron Guard]], which had just assassinated [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion G. Duca]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Gheorghe, Miliana Șerbu, ''Miniștrii de interne (1862–2007). Mică enciclopedie'', p. 252. Bucharest: [[Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Romanian Ministry of the Interior]], 2007.  {{ISBN|978-973-745-048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gomoiu was also investigated for an alleged plot to assassinate Carol, but he rejected the charges, and insisted that he only wanted Queen Helen to be allowed back in the country. His account was backed by the Union of Reserve Officers, which staged a public protest; its influence, insiders speculated, explained by Gomoiu was treated leniently in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://bc.wbp.lodz.pl/Content/46559/Express_Wieczorny_Ilustr1934_nr98a.pdf "Zamach na króla rumuńskiego przygotowywała 'Zelazna Gwardja'"], in ''Express Wieczorny Ilustrowany'', April 9, 1934, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1936, Gomoiu was called upon by the Iron Guard to be a defense witness for [[Valerian Trifa|Viorel Trifa]], Alecu Cantacuzino, and other Guardista accused of conspiracy against the state.&lt;ref name="pțcamar197"/&gt;

Gomoiu was president of the ISHM from 1936 to 1940, having successfully defeated with [[Maxime Laignel Lavastine]], who became his bitter adversary.&lt;ref&gt;Tricot, pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; He had by then established inside the international body a Cantacuzène Commission, named after (and presided upon by) [[Ion Cantacuzino]]. It tasked with researching and inventorying European medical folklore—although this subject was of marginal interest to Cantacuzino himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tricot, pp. 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; Gomoiu also returned to his anatomical research, publishing in 1938 a definitive monograph of the [[connective tissue]] (''Țesutul conjunctiv''), co-authored by his student V. Plătăreanu.&lt;ref&gt;Riga &amp; Călin, pp. 378, 525&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, the two also presented a report on "the cross in Romanian medical folklore" to the ISHM Congress in [[Zagreb]]; with Al. Raicovicianu, Gomoiu also published the bibliographic corpus ''Histoire du folklore médical en Roumanie'' ("A History of Medical Folklore in Romania").&lt;ref&gt;"Bibliografia folklorului românesc pe anii 1939—1943", in ''Anuarul Arhivei de Folklor'', Vol. VII, 1945, pp. 147, 183&lt;/ref&gt;

By that moment in history, Carol had established his [[National Renaissance Front]] dictatorship, and, in 1940, appointed [[Ion Gigurtu]] to lead a government that included some Iron Guard members. Gomoiu also joined, serving as Gigurtu's Health Minister from July 4 to September 4.&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, pp. 135&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, and also as a member of the [[Crown Council of Romania|Crown Council]], he was marginally involved in the major international crisis which saw the cession of Romanian land to the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Axis Powers]]. On the night of August 29–30, he was among a majority of ministers who voted to [[Second Vienna Award|peacefully cede]] the regions of [[Northern Transylvania]] to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Regency Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Doina Leahu, "Însemnări inedite ale lui Victor Iamandi în Consiliul de Coroană din 19/30 august 1940", in ''Muzeul Național'', Vol. I, 1974, pp. 229–230; [[Ion Mihalache]], "Însemnări memorialistice (4)", in ''Forum Cultural'', Vol. VII, Issue 3, September 2007, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Gomoiu kept his ministerial office during the first government of [[Ion Antonescu]], from September 4 to 14, until the establishment of the [[National Legionary State]] and Carol's flight from the country.&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, p. 137. See also Tricot, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he resented Antonescu's alliance with the Iron Guard, and avoided politics altogether.&lt;ref name="jpt116"/&gt;

In October 1942, at the height of Antonescu's alliance with [[Nazi Germany]], Gomoiu's friend [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]] was arrested with other Jews and scheduled to be deported to [[Transnistria Governorate]], but was spared thanks to Gomoiu's appeal to Queen Helen, who intervened on Lăzăreanu's behalf. As a Swiss journalist reported at the time, Gomoiu, "a man so nice that he could not imagine that the Jews are so persecuted", personally visited the Jewish detainees and convinced himself of their mistreatment, before contacting the queen. The latter insisted that she would leave the country, and endanger Antonescu's legitimacy, if the deportations would continue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Deletant]], ''Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and His Regime, Romania, 1940–1944'', p. 212.

Upon the end of World War II and a 6-year hiatus, Gomoiu was finally replaced as head of the ISHM by Laignel Lavastine.&lt;ref&gt;Tricot, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the establishment of a [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] in December 1947, Gomoiu was removed from teaching.&lt;ref name="ci"/&gt; He was arrested, together with tens of others former dignitaries, on the night of May 5, 1950, and detained with them in the basement of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of the Interior]], [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Palace Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Claudiu Secașiu, "Distrugerea elitei politice românești. Noaptea Demnitarilor (5/6 mai 1950)", in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 33 (433), August 1998, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Incarcerated at [[Sighet prison]] from 1950 to 1953,&lt;ref name="ci"/&gt; where he was held in solitary confinement, he was transported to Bucharest in order to participate in a 1954 international congress on medical history.&lt;ref name="digit"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://inst-idst.ro/ro/idst/mecanisme-represive/partea-i-literele-a-l/g/pagina24 ''Instrumente digitale pentru studiul totalitarismului – G'']&lt;/ref&gt; Released in 1954, he refused a position in the communized Health Ministry offered to him in 1956, viewing it is a form of collaborationism.&lt;ref name="jpt116"/&gt; Although some sources claim that he lived the rest of his days in [[Aiud prison]],&lt;ref name="ci"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digit"/&gt; he is known to have died in Bucharest in 1960, "almost forgotten by everyone."&lt;ref name="jpt116"/&gt; He was buried in Plot 33 of [[Bellu cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', p. 146. Bucharest: [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, his holdings and the minutes of his Medical History Society were donated to the [[University of Craiova]] by his widow Viorica, and form the basis for a museum of medical and pharmaceutical history. This was inaugurated within the medical faculty in 1974 and set up in its own building between 1979 and 1982.&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cșoltean"/&gt; In recognition of Gomoiu's local contribution, an amphitheater was named after him.&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt; The [[Romanian Post]] also issued, in 1981, a series of stamps honoring the Medical History Society, with a [[postmark]] bearing Gomoiu's portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Julien, "Question CXX, Pharmacie et philatélie", in ''Revue d'Histoire de la Pharmacie'', Vol. 76, Issue 276, 1988, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, following the [[Romanian Revolution]], the institution in Bariera Vergului, now a children's hospital, was renamed in honor of its late founder.&lt;ref name="cșoltean"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.spitalgomoiu.ro/page-istoric History] at the Dr. Victor Gomoiu Clinical Children's Hospital site&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the high school in Vânju Mare became "Victor Gomoiu Theoretical High School".&lt;ref name="cșoltean"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://liceuldrvictorgomoiu.info History] at the Dr. Victor Gomoiu Theoretical High School site&lt;/ref&gt; His memoirs, recovered from the secret archives of the [[Securitate]], were only published in 2006.&lt;ref name="cșoltean"/&gt;

{{dablink|"Standing water" redirects here. For the song "Standing Water" by [[Soul Asylum]], see [[The Silver Lining (Soul Asylum album)|The Silver Lining]]}}
'''Water stagnation''' occurs when [[water]] stops [[Environmental flow|flowing]]. '''Stagnant water''' can be a major [[environmental hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/panama-fever/ |title=General Article: Yellow Fever and Malaria in the Canal |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2010 |website=Panama Canal (film) |series=American Experience |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
[[Malaria]] and [[dengue]] are among the main dangers of stagnant water, which can become a breeding ground for the [[mosquitoes]] that transmit these diseases.&lt;ref name="WHO health risks"&gt;{{cite report |date=2013 |title=Health Risks Associated with Stagnant Water |series=Recommendations for Occupational Health and Safety Following Disasters |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/philippines/typhoon_haiyan/media/health_risks_associated_with_stagnant_water.pdf |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stagnant water can be dangerous for drinking because it provides a better incubator than running water for many kinds of [[bacteria]] and [[parasite]]s. Stagnant water is often contaminated with [[human]] and [[animal]] [[feces]], particularly in [[deserts]] or other areas of low rain.&lt;ref name="WHO health risks"/&gt;

Stagnant water may be classified into the following basic, although overlapping, types:

* Water body stagnation (stagnation in swamp, lake, lagoon, river, etc.)
* Surface and ground waters stagnation
* Trapped water stagnation. The water may be trapped in human artifacts (discarded cans, plant pots, tires, dug-outs, roofs, etc.), as well as in natural containers, such as hollow tree trunks, leaf sheath etc.

To avoid ground and surface water stagnation, [[drainage]] of surface and [[subsoil]] is advised. Areas with a shallow water table are more susceptible to ground water stagnation due to the lower availability of natural soil drainage.

==Life that may thrive in stagnant water==
Some plants prefer flowing water, while others, such as [[Lotus (genus)|lotus]]es, prefer stagnant water.

Various [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[bacteria]] are commonly found in stagnant water &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabral|first1=João|title=Water Microbiology. Bacterial Pathogens and Water|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|date=October 10, 2010|pmc=2996186|pmid=21139855|doi=10.3390/ijerph7103657|volume=7|pages=3657–703}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  For this reason, pools of stagnant water have historically been used in processing [[hemp]] and some other [[fiber crops]], as well as [[Tilia|linden]] [[Bark (botany)|bark]] used for making [[bast shoe]]s. Several weeks of soaking makes [[bast fiber]]s easily separable due to bacterial and fermentative processes known as [[retting]].

*[[Denitrifying bacteria]]
*[[Leptospira]]
*[[Purple bacteria]] (both sulfur and non-sulfur)

===Fish===
* [[Lepisosteidae]] (gar).
* [[Northern snakehead]] fish
* [[Pygmy gourami]]....
* [[Spotted barb]]
* [[Walking catfish]]
* [[Asian swamp eel]]
[[Image:Mosquito larvae.jpg|thumb|200px|Mosquito [[larva]]e in stagnant water]]

===Insects===
Stagnant water is the favorite breeding ground for a number of [[insect]]s.
* [[Dragonfly]] nymphs
* [[Fly]] magnets
* [[Mosquito]] larvae
* [[Nepidae]] (water scorpions)

===Other===
* [[Algae]]
* [[Biofilm]]
* A number of species of [[frog]]s prefer stagnant water.
* Some species of [[turtle]]s
** [[Mata mota]]

==Personal life==

Heston was born in [[Ionia, Michigan]] on April 27, 1872, to Alonzo Heston and Mary Elizabeth Heston (née Brown).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Heston had one half-sister, Jessie B. Coulter (née Clark),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a daughter of her mother’s from a previous marriage to Henry N. Clark.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Heston spent her early life in [[Charlotte, Michigan]], with her mother and half-sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Records of the Bureau of the Census, Record Group 29. National Archives, Washington, D.C.|last=|first=|date=1880|work=Tenth Census of the United States, 1880. (NARA microfilm publication T9, 1,454 rolls).|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heston served as an associate physician at the General Hospital in [[Miraj|Miraj, India]], from 1903 to 1907.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; During Heston's first period of missionary work in India, her sister, Jessie B. Coulter (née Clark), died following a long illness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This was very difficult for Heston, since she was so far away from her sister, who was still living in Michigan, when it happened.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The loss made Heston reluctant to return to the United States, since she knew her sister would no longer be there when she arrived in Michigan.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Heston returned to the United States in 1908.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She sailed from [[India]] on March 15, 1908 and arrived in New York on May 22, 1908.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During her voyage home from India, Heston became romantically involved with a British officer who had also been working in the [[Maharashtra|Maharashtra State]] in India during the time Heston was there.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He was aboard the same ship Heston took when she left India in 1908, both of them traveling through Italy on their trip back to their respective home countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Heston and other passengers on the ship, including other missionaries and Italian military officers, visited [[Naples|Naples, Italy]], after their ship arrived in Europe. During this time, Heston wrote in letters to friends at home that she had become close to the officer, who was a major in the British army.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Heston had encountered the officer before, during her time in India, when he brought her back to the Presbyterian mission after she had fallen off her horse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

After they parted ways in Italy, Heston received a letter from the officer, claiming that he would come to visit her if she gave him any encouragement. Heston indicated in a letter that she planned to invite him to visit her in the United States.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In a letter to her friend in 1908, Heston suggested that she planned to marry the officer. She feared that this would prevent her from returning to India to do missionary work.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ultimately, Heston never married,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and returned to India for a second mission in 1910.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After returning home, Heston compiled a collection of her personal letters into the novel ''A Bluestocking in India: Her Medical Wards and Messages Home,''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which was published by the Fleming H. Revell Company in 1910.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Bluestocking in India|last=Heston|first=Winifred|publisher=Fleming H.

In 1909, Heston took a government position as an eye doctor, serving the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Suffering from poor health after her time in India, she only spent one year working there. After leaving Arizona, she spent a brief period of time living in California, but had to return home due to her illness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She returned home to Michigan for a short time, then sailed to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] again on December 17, 1910.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington D.C.; NARA Series: Emergency Passport Applications, Argentina thru Venezuela, 1906-1925; Box #: 4667|last=|first=|date=22 March 1915|work=Volume #: Volume 004: Calcutta, India|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1910 to 1915, Heston worked at a hospital for women and children in Jhelum, India under the United Presbyterian Board.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1915, Heston sailed back to the [[United States]] via [[China]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Heston died on June 1, 1922, in [[East Jordan, Michigan]], of an accidental [[morphine]] [[Drug overdose|overdose]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Death Records. Michigan Department of Community Health, Division for Vital Records and Health Statistics, Lansing, Michigan.|last=|first=|date=1922|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; She was 50 years old.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Education==

Heston graduated from [[Alma College]], a Presbyterian university in Michigan, in 1896,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and from the Laura Memorial Woman's Medical College of Cincinnati, in 1901,&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; with the degrees of [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] and [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] She worked for one year as an intern at the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Hospital in [[Cincinnati]] before accepting service with the Foreign Mission Society of the Presbyterian Church.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Journey==

Heston sailed to [[Mumbai|Bombay, India]], from [[New York City|New York, New York]], leaving the United States on October 14, 1902.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  She was accompanied on her voyage by two other [[Christian]] [[Missionary|missionaries]], who left their ten-year-old daughter behind in America when they left for India.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Heston described their parting as tearful, and was very sad to leave New York herself.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; She arrived in Bombay on November 20, 1902, and began preparing for missionary work.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Missionary Work==
Heston went on her first medical mission to India in 1902,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and remained in India until she returned to the United States in 1908.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After a period of time working in the United States, she went back to India for another mission in 1910,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and remained for five years before returning to the United States in 1915.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===First Mission===

After arriving in Bombay, Heston began to learn the local [[Marathi language|Marathi]] language, which the Presbyterian board required missionaries in Western India to study during the first year of their service in India.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Heston, however, took the Marathi proficiency exam after only six months of study and began working actively in the community before the end of her first year in India.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

After finishing her studies, Heston became an associate physician at the General Hospital in [[Miraj|Miraj, India]], in the [[Maharashtra|Maharashtra State]], which is known today as the Mary Wanless Hospital/Miraj Medical Center.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In 1903, the hospital was under the direction of [[William James Wanless|William J. Wanless]], M.D., a missionary who, like Heston, had traveled to India with the Presbyterian board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1903|title=Annual Report of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|url=|journal=Annual Report of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|volume=|pages=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heston served as an associate physician in Miraj from the beginning of her missionary work in 1903 until she returned to the United States in 1908.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During her time in Miraj, Heston performed over five hundred surgical operations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Return Home===

Heston returned to the United States for two years between her periods of missionary service. She sailed from Bombay on March 15, 1908, and arrived in New York on May 22, 1908.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She sailed to New York via Italy, stopping to visit [[Venice]] and [[Naples]] with other missionaries and military officers aboard her ship.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Heston had felt ill and tired throughout much of her later years in India, which she felt may have been linked to her grief after the death of her half-sister in 1904 and the loss of another missionary working at the General Hospital in Miraj.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Upon her return to New York, she was advised by a nerve specialist to take a "[[Bed rest|rest cure]]" and remain on bed rest for at least four weeks.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 1908 and 1909, Heston lived with her mother in Michigan and compiled letters she had sent while abroad to create her novel ''A Bluestocking in India: Her Medical Wards and Messages Home,''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which was published by the Fleming H. Revell Company in 1910.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In October 1909, Heston took a government position in [[Arizona]] as an eye specialist. She served the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] community there until leaving for California in 1910. Due to her poor health, Heston only spent a brief period in California before returning home to Michigan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Second Mission===

In 1910, Heston returned to India to continue her missionary work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Before leaving India after her first period of missionary work in 1908, she had been informed that the Presbyterian board planned to open a hospital for women and children in Jhelum, India, which should be ready for work in less than two years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 1910, Heston took charge of that hospital and worked there until 1915, completing more surgical operations than she had during her previous service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Dr. Heston is known for her significant surgical service as a female surgeon in India, her leadership as founding director of the mission hospital in [[Jhelum Cantonment]], and her book ''A Bluestocking in India: Her Medical Wards and Messages Home,''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Death==

In 1915, Heston returned to Michigan, sailing from India via [[Japan]] and [[California]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She lived in [[East Jordan, Michigan|East Jordan]], Charlevoix, Michigan, until her death in 1922.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Heston died on June 1, 1922, in [[East Jordan, Michigan]], of an accidental [[morphine]] [[Drug overdose|overdose]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The overdose may have been connected to Heston's long illness.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; She was advised to take a "rest cure" after returning from her first mission to India in 1908, due to poor health during her time abroad,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and was troubled by her illness during her time in United States, when she was unable to remain in Arizona or California for long periods of time due to her health issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was 50 years old at the time of her death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Wolfgang J. Lutz''' (May 27, 1913 – 19 September 2010) was an Austrian inventor, physician and author of Leben ohne Brot. He showed how, with little recourse to surgery or drugs, fundamental improvement could be made to health through low carbohydrate nutrition; Lutz demonstrated, inter alia, a probable way of preventing the huge and mounting toll exacted by obesity and diabetes. To honour this contribution, Lutz was made a Freeman of the City of London in 2007. His book with Christian Allan: Life without Bread: How a low-carbohydrate diet can save your life &lt;ref name="refone"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Life_Without_Bread.html?id=NJ6oNV3q3X0C | title=Life Without Bread: How a Low-Carbohydrate Diet Can Save Your Life | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is still in print after 16 years. Recently a biography has been published: My Life without Bread: Dr Lutz at 90,&lt;ref name="reftwo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/My_Life_Without_Bread.html?id=EjLkoQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y | title=My Life Without Bread: Dr Lutz at 90 | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes a complete list of his publications, also: Uncle Wolfi's Secret, which explores the work of Dr Lutz in everyday language.&lt;ref name="refthree"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Uncle_Wolfi_s_Secret.html?id=6MPBoQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y | title=Uncle Wolfi's Secret Kindle Edition by Valerie Bracken | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in 1913 in [[Upper Austria]], Dr Lutz read medicine at [[Innsbruck]] and [[Vienna]]. His notable career in scientific research included inventing a prototype spacesuit and developing resuscitation techniques to prevent death from freezing, which brought Lutz the award of Habilitation, a great distinction in the scientific world, together with a post [[doctoral degree]] in internal and aviation medicine from the [[University of Vienna]], After [[World War II]], Wolfgang Lutz became a practicing [[physician]].&lt;ref name="reffive" /&gt; As a consultant in internal medicine, Wolfgang Lutz turned his attention to the dramatic escalation of [[degenerative disease]]. His wide-ranging and penetrating gaze swept from our Ice-Age origins to the modern world and his approach to medicine changed.

Taking as his basic thesis that the pattern of our hormonal secretion is still tuned to the largely animal food diet of that distant epoch, Lutz surmised that too large an intake of carbohydrate might disturb the intrinsic harmony of the [[endocrine system]] and hence our health, ultimately leading to disease. This caused him, as early as the 1950s, to instigate a diet for long-term use that he felt to be low enough in carbohydrate to be compatible with our genetic inheritance and so restore the missing harmony.

==Career==
The body’s primary response to an increase in dietary carbohydrate is to increase insulin production. Wolfgang Lutz demonstrated that his obese patients often suffered from an overproduction of insulin and identified a see-sawing of compensatory hormonal measures: typically, an increase in insulin, thyroid and adrenal hormones, and a decrease in the [[growth hormone]]. Sex hormones were also affected. Lutz was the first to describe how these disturbances in hormonal regulation and their very varied repercussions underlay many of the diseases of civilisation.

In the early 1960s, Wolfgang Lutz conducted ground-breaking hen-feeding trials which showed that, in hens, a reduction in carbohydrate - not of fat - reduced the incidence of [[arteriosclerosis]]. (Hens like humans had moved from a largely animal to a largely carbohydrate diet and suffered similar changes in their arterial walls in old age.) Reassured by this, together with the relief from pain and inflammation he experienced with his own [[Osteoarthritis|osteoarthritic]] hips and the positive results from his growing clinical experience, Lutz was to spend the next forty or so years observing on a wide range of ailments both the immediate results and, when possible, the effect of following his diet for many years. As it went to the very root of the problem, the simple expedient of sufficient carbohydrate restriction (with no limitation put on protein or fat intake, nor on calories except as a short-term measure for extreme obesity) proved a remarkable therapeutic tool.

Dr Lutz was to find that his low carbohydrate diet was effective with both childhood obesity and with [[hyperinsulinism]] - a hormonal pathway to both common obesity and, through exhaustion of supply, to [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type II diabetes]]: he found that sufficient carbohydrate restriction could prevent the vascular complications of adult onset diabetes.  Carefully implemented and occasionally with temporary support from drugs, Lutz further demonstrated the benefit of his diet to a wide range of medical conditions from early multiple sclerosis to heart failure, from [[Crohn's disease|morbus Crohn]] and [[ulcerative colitis]] to osteoarthritis; he showed low carbohydrate nutrition could lower [[cholesterol]] levels, normalise high and low levels of blood iron and calcium and ease many problems of reproduction. Wolfgang Lutz also found that his low carbohydrate diet brought patients many general improvements amongst which were improved immune function, a calmer [[nervous system]], better digestion, enhanced skin and tissue quality, and a positive effect on overall health.  His main book Leben ohne Brot reached its 16th edition in 2007&lt;ref name="reffour"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/Leben-ohne-Brot-Wolfgang-Lutz/dp/3887601009 | title=Leben ohne Brot by Wolfgang Lutz | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being in continuous print for forty years.

==Death==
Dr Lutz died in Austria in 2010, at 97 years of age.&lt;ref name="reffive"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/nov/30/wolfgang-lutz-obituary | title=Wolfgang Lutz obituary | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Dr Wolfgang Lutz had five children.  In 1997 Dr Lutz registered with the B M A in order to be able to work in the U K. He and his 3rd wife Helen Paula lived for 6 months a year in London and spent the other six in [[Graz]], Austria.&lt;ref name="reffive" /&gt; Wolfgang Lutz was a member of the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]].
