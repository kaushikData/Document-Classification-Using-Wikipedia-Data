      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">In the [[mathematical]] [[discipline]] of [[graph theory]], '''2-factor theorem''' discovered by [[Julius Petersen]], is one of the earliest works in graph theory and can be stated as follows:

: '''2-factor theorem'''. Let ''G'' be 2''k''-regular graph, then ''E''(''G'') can be decomposed into the union of ''k'' line-disjoint 2-factors.&lt;ref&gt;Lovász, László, and Plummer, M.D.. ''Matching Theory'', American Mathematical Soc., Jan 1, 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==

In order to prove this generalized form of the theorem, Petersen first proved that a 4-regular graph can be [[Graph factorization|factorized]] into two 2-factors by taking alternate edges in a Eulerian trail. He noted that the same technique used for the 4-regular graph yields a factorization of a 2''k''-regular graph into two ''k''-factors.&lt;ref&gt;Mulder, H. "Julius Petersen’s theory of regular graphs". ''Discrete Mathematics'', 100 (1992) 157-175 North-Holland&lt;/ref&gt;
 
To prove this theorem, first we remark that it is sufficient to consider connected graphs. A connected graph with even degree has an Eulerian trail. Traversing this Eulerian trail we get an orientation ''D'' of ''G'' such that every point has indegree and outdegree&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''. Then we replace every point ''v''&amp;nbsp;ϵ&amp;nbsp;''V''(''D'') by two points ''v’'', ''v”'', and for every directed line ''uv''&amp;nbsp;ϵ&amp;nbsp;''E''(''D'') we draw in one line from ''u’'' to ''v”''. Since ''D'' has in- and outdegree equal to ''k'' the resulting bigraph ''G’'' is ''k''-regular. The lines of ''G’'' can be decomposed into ''k'' perfect matchings. Now if we identify ''v’'' and ''v”'' for every ''v'', we recover the graph ''G'', and these ''k'' perfect matchings of ''G’'' will be mapped onto ''k'' 2-factors of ''G'' which partition the lines.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

In other words, for the general case the factorization of a 2''k''-regular graph into two factors is an easy consequence of Euler’s theorem: By applying the same argument to each component, we may assume that G is connected and 2''k''-regular with vertices ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''C'' be an [[Eulerian circuit]] of ''G'', followed in a particular direction. Then use Eulerian circuit of ''G'' to create an supplementary ''k''-regular bipartite graph H, such that a [[perfect matching]] in ''H'' corresponds to a 2-factor in&amp;nbsp;''G''.

==History==
The theorem was discovered by [[Julius Petersen]], a Danish mathematician. It is in fact, one of the first results in [[graph theory]]. The theorem appears first in the 1891 article ''"Die Theorie der regulären graphs"''. To prove the theorem Petersen's fundamental idea was to 'colour' the edges of a trial or a path alternatingly red and blue, and then to use the edges of one or both colours for the construction of other paths or trials.&lt;ref&gt;Lützen, J.; Sabidussi, G. and Toft, B. (1992). "Julius Petersen 1839–1910 a biography". ''Discrete Mathematics'', 100 (1–3): 9–82&lt;/ref&gt;

'''40''' ('''forty''') is the [[natural number]] following [[39 (number)|39]] and preceding [[41 (number)|41]].

Though the word is related to "four" (4), the spelling "forty" replaced "fourty" in the course of the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=fourty%2F%28forty%2Bfourty%29&amp;year_start=1500&amp;year_end=1800&amp;smoothing=10 Google nGrams]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st edition, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/73764 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt; and is now the standard form.

===Christianity===
Christianity similarly uses forty to designate important time periods.&lt;ref name="coogan"/&gt;

* Before his [[temptation of Christ|temptation]], Jesus fasted "forty days and forty nights" in the [[Judean desert]] (Matthew 4:2, Mark 1:13, Luke 4:2).

* The [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]]
* [[Kirk Kilisse]], "Forty Churches" (Σαράντα Εκκλησιές) in Eastern Thrace

===Islam===
* [[Muhammad]] was forty years old when he first received the revelation delivered by the archangel Gabriel.

===Yazidism===
* In the [[Yazidi]] faith, The Chermera Temple (meaning "40 Men" in the Yazidi dialect) is so old that no one remembers how it came to have that name but it is believed to derive from the burial of 40 men on the mountaintop site.

===Funerary customs===
* Some Russians and Serbs believe that [[ghost]]s of the dead linger at the site of their death for forty days. After the forty days, additional prayers are performed at the grave (parastos (парастос) or panihida (панихида)), to escort the soul on its way to God's court. 
* Many Christian Filipinos mark the end of the initial mourning period on the fortieth day after death, and have a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] said. They believe that the soul remains on the earthly plane for forty days before entering the afterlife, recalling how Christ [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended to heaven]] forty days after his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].

===Hinduism===
* In [[Hinduism]], some popular religious prayers consist of forty [[shloka]]s or [[Doha (poetry)|dohas]] (couplets, stanzas). The most common being the [[Hanuman Chalisa]] (''chaalis'' is the Hindi term for 40).

In the Hindu system some of the popular fasting periods consist 40 days and is called the period One 'Mandl kal' Kal means a period and Mandal kal means a period of 40 days. For example, the devotees of Swami Ayyappa, the name of a Hindu god very popular in Kerala, India (Sabarimala Swami Ayyappan) strictly observed forty days fasting and visit (only male devotees are permitted to enter into the god's temple) with their holy submittance or offerings on 41st or a convenient day after a minimum 40 days practice of fasting. The offering is called "Kanikka".

===Sumerian===
* [[Enki]] ( /ˈɛŋki/) or Enkil (Sumerian: dEN.KI(G)𒂗𒆠) is a god in Sumerian mythology, later known as Ea in Akkadian and Babylonian mythology. He was originally patron god of the city of [[Eridu]], but later the influence of his cult spread throughout [[Mesopotamia]] and to the [[Canaanites]], [[Hittites]] and [[Hurrians]]. He was the deity of crafts (gašam); mischief; water, seawater, lake water (a, aba, ab), intelligence (gestú, literally "ear") and creation (Nudimmud: nu, likeness, dim mud, make bear). He was associated with the southern band of constellations called stars of Ea, but also with the constellation AŠ-IKU, the Field ([[Square of Pegasus]]). Beginning around the second millennium BCE, he was sometimes referred to in writing by the numeric ideogram for "40," occasionally referred to as his "sacred number."
 
A large number of myths about Enki have been collected from many sites, stretching from Southern Iraq to the Levantine coast. He figures in the earliest extant cuneiform inscriptions throughout the region and was prominent from the third millennium down to Hellenistic times.
 
The exact meaning of his name is uncertain: the common translation is "Lord of the Earth": the Sumerian en is translated as a title equivalent to "lord"; it was originally a title given to the High Priest; ki means "earth"; but there are theories that ki in this name has another origin, possibly kig of unknown meaning, or kur meaning "mound". The name Ea is allegedly Hurrian in origin while others claim that it is possibly of Semitic origin and may be a derivation from the West-Semitic root *hyy meaning "life" in this case used for "spring", "running water." In Sumerian E-A means "the house of water", and it has been suggested that this was originally the name for the shrine to the God at Eridu.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1896">In [[mathematics]], an '''abelian surface''' is  2-dimensional [[abelian variety]].

One-dimensional complex tori are just [[elliptic curve]]s and are all algebraic, but [[Riemann]] discovered that most complex tori of dimension 2 are not algebraic. The algebraic ones are called abelian surfaces and are exactly the 2-dimensional [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]].
Most of their theory is a special case of the theory of higher-dimensional tori or abelian varieties. Criteria to be a product of two elliptic curves (up to [[isogeny]]) were a popular study in the nineteenth century.

'''Invariants:''' The [[Kodaira dimension#The plurigenera|plurigenera]] are all 1. The surface is diffeomorphic to ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; so the fundamental group is '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Usage==
When the Aksharapalli system is used, the various syllables that constitute a number are placed one below the other as in the Chinese language and they are written in the margins of the various leaves of the manuscript. This arrangement may be the consequence an attempt to save space for the contents of the manuscript. This method can be seen in the earliest available manuscript containing the Aksharapalli system which is a manuscript of sixth century CE.

==History==
Nothing definitely is known about the origin of the system. It is conjectured that the system might have evolved from the ciphered-additive numeral system of [[Brahmi]].&lt;ref name=alpha/&gt; This system has been extensively used in Jain manuscripts up to sixteenth century. The system has also survived for a long time in [[Nepal]]. The system was in use as late as the nineteenth century in those regions of India which now constitute the [[Kerala State]].&lt;ref name=alpha/&gt;

'''Algorithmic game theory''' is an area in the intersection of [[game theory]] and [[computer science]], whose objective is to understand and design algorithms in [[Strategy (game theory)|strategic]] environments. Typically, in Algorithmic Game Theory problems, the input to a given algorithm is distributed among many players who have a personal interest in the output. In those situations, the agents might not report the input truthfully because of their own personal interests. On top of the usual requirements in classical algorithm design, say ''polynomial-time running time'', ''good approximation ratio'', ... the designer must also care about incentive constraints. We can see Algorithmic Game Theory from two perspectives:

* ''Analysis'': look at the current implemented algorithms and analyze them using Game Theory tools: calculate and prove properties on their [[Nash equilibria]], [[price of anarchy]], best-response dynamics ...
* ''Design'': design games that have both good game-theoretical and algorithmic properties. This area is called [[algorithmic mechanism design]].

==History==
===Nisan-Ronen: a new framework for studying algorithms===

In 1999, the seminal paper of [[Noam Nisan|Nisan]] and Ronen &lt;ref name="nr"&gt;{{citation
 | last1 = Nisan | first1 = Noam | author1-link = Noam Nisan
 | last2 = Ronen | first2 = Amir
 | contribution = Algorithmic mechanism design
 | doi = 10.1145/301250.301287
 | pages = 129–140
 | title = Proceedings of the 31st ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC '99)
 | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; drew the attention of the Theoretical Computer Science community to designing algorithms for selfish (strategic) users. As they claim in the abstract:

{{Quote|We consider algorithmic problems in a distributed setting where the participants cannot be assumed to follow the algorithm but rather their own self-interest. As such participants, termed agents, are capable of manipulating the algorithm, the algorithm designer should ensure in advance that the agents’ interests are best served by behaving correctly.

Following notions from the field of mechanism design, we suggest a framework for studying such algorithms. In this model the algorithmic solution is adorned with payments to the participants and is termed a mechanism. The payments should be carefully chosen as to motivate all participants to act as the algorithm designer wishes. We apply the standard tools of mechanism design to algorithmic problems and in particular to the shortest path problem.}}

This paper coined the term [[algorithmic mechanism design]] and was recognized by the 2012 [[Gödel Prize]] committee as one of "three papers laying foundation of growth in Algorithmic Game Theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

===Price of Anarchy===
{{main article|Price of Anarchy}}
The other two papers cited in the 2012 Gödel Prize for fundamental contributions to Algorithmic Game Theory introduced and developed the concept of "Price of Anarchy". 
In their 1999 paper "Worst-case Equilibria",&lt;ref name = "kp"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Worst-case Equilibria|first=Elias|last=Koutsoupias|first2=Christos|last2=Papadimitriou|journal=Computer Science Review|volume=3|issue=2|date=May 2009|pages=65–69|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~christos/nash.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koutsoupias and [[Christos Papadimitriou|Papadimitriou]] proposed a new measure of the degradation of system efficiency due to the selfish behavior of its agents: the ratio of between system efficiency at an optimal configuration, and its efficiency at the worst Nash equilibrium. 
(The term "Price of Anarchy" only appeared a couple of years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | doi = 10.1145/380752.380883

 | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;)


===The Internet as a catalyst===
The Internet created a new economy—both as a foundation for exchange and commerce, and in its own right. The computational nature of the Internet allowed for the use of computational tools in this new emerging economy. On the other hand, the Internet itself is the outcome of actions of many. This was new to the classic, ‘top-down’ approach to computation that held till then. Thus, game theory is a natural way to view the Internet and interactions within it, both human and mechanical.

Game theory studies equilibria (such as the [[Nash equilibrium]]). An equilibrium is generally defined as a state in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy. Equilibria are found in several fields related to the Internet, for instance financial interactions and communication load-balancing{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Game theory provides tools to analyze equilibria, and a common approach is then to ‘find the game’—that is, to formalize specific Internet interactions as a game, and to derive the associated equilibria.

Rephrasing problems in terms of games allows the analysis of Internet-based interactions and the construction of mechanisms to meet specified demands. If equilibria can be shown to exist, a further question must be answered: can an equilibrium be found, and in reasonable time? This leads to the [[analysis of algorithms]] for finding equilibria. Of special importance is the complexity class [[PPAD (complexity)|PPAD]], which includes many problems in algorithmic game theory.

==Areas of research==
The main areas of research in algorithmic game theory include:

* [[Algorithmic mechanism design]]
* Inefficiency of equilibria ([[price of anarchy]], [[price of stability]])
* [[Computational complexity theory|Complexity]] of finding equilibria
* [[Market equilibrium]]
* [[Multi-agent systems]]
* [[Computational social choice]]

And the area counts with diverse practical applications:

* [[Routing]]
* [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] systems
* [[Sponsored search auction|Sponsored search auctions]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3501">'''Algorithmic transparency''' is the principle that the factors that influence the decisions made by [[algorithms]] should be visible, or transparent, to the people who use, regulate, and are impacted by systems that employ those algorithms. Although the phrase was coined in 2016 by Nicholas Diakopoulos and Michael Koliska about the role of algorithms in deciding the content of digital journalism services&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Diakopoulos &amp; Michael Koliska (2016): Algorithmic Transparency in the News Media, Digital Journalism, DOI: 10.1080/21670811.2016.1208053&lt;/ref&gt;, the underlying principle dates back to the 1970s and the rise of automated systems for scoring consumer credit.

The phrases "algorithmic transparency" and "algorithmic accountability"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diakopoulos|first1=Nicholas|title=Algorithmic Accountability: Journalistic Investigation of Computational Power Structures.|journal=Digital Journalism|date=2015|volume=3|issue=3|page=398-415}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes used interchangeably – especially since they were coined by the same people – but they have subtly different meanings. Specifically, "algorithmic transparency" states that the inputs to the algorithm and the algorithm's use itself must be known, but they need not be fair.  "Algorithmic accountability" implies that the organizations that use algorithms must be accountable for the decisions made by those algorithms, even though the decisions are being made by a machine, and not by a human being.&lt;ref name="Dickey"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickey|first1=Megan Rose|title=Algorithmic Accountability|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/30/algorithmic-accountability/|accessdate=4 September 2017|work=TechCrunch|date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current research around algorithmic transparency interested in both societal effects of accessing remote services running algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop on Data and Algorithmic Transparency|url=http://datworkshop.org/|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as mathematical and computer science approaches that can be used to achieve algorithmic transparency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning|url=http://www.fatml.org/|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]]'s Bureau of Consumer Protection studies how algorithms are used by consumers by conducting its own research on algorithmic transparency and by funding external research.&lt;ref name="Noyes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noyes|first1=Katherine|title=The FTC is worried about algorithmic transparency, and you should be too|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2908372/the-ftc-is-worried-about-algorithmic-transparency-and-you-should-be-too.html|accessdate=4 September 2017|work=PCWorld|date=9 April 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Union]], the data protection laws that came into effect in May 2018 include a "right to explanation" of decisions made by algorithms, though it is unclear what this means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=False Testimony |journal=Nature |date=31 May 2018 |volume=557 |issue=7707 |page=612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is closely related to the '''stable homeomorphism conjecture''' (now proved) which states that every orientation-preserving homeomorphism of Euclidean space is stable.

==Statement==
If ''S'' and ''T'' are topological spheres in Euclidean space, with ''S'' contained in ''T'', then it is not true in general that the region between them is an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]],  because of the existence of [[wild sphere]]s in dimension at least 3. So the annulus theorem has to be stated to exclude these examples, by adding some condition to ensure that ''S'' and ''T'' are well behaved. There are several ways to do this.

The annulus theorem states that if any homeomorphism ''h'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to itself maps the unit ball ''B'' into its interior, then ''B'' &amp;minus; ''h''(interior(''B'')) is homeomorphic to the annulus '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;[0,1].

==History of proof==
The annulus theorem is trivial in dimensions 0 and 1. It was proved in dimension 2 by {{harvtxt|Radó|1924}}, in dimension 3 by {{harvtxt|Moise|1952}}, in dimension 4 by {{harvtxt|Quinn|1982}}, and in dimensions at least 5 by {{harvtxt|Kirby|1969}}.

==The stable homeomorphism conjecture==

A homeomorphism of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is called '''stable''' if it is a product of homeomorphisms each of which is the identity on some non-empty open set. 
The '''stable homeomorphism conjecture''' states that every orientation-preserving homeomorphism of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is stable. {{harvtxt|Brown|Gluck|1964}} previously showed that the  stable homeomorphism conjecture is equivalent to the annulus conjecture, so it is true.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22092">In [[mathematics]], an '''arithmetic group''' is a group obtained as the integer points of an [[algebraic group]], for example &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\Z).&lt;/math&gt; They arise naturally in the study of arithmetic properties of [[quadratic form]]s and other classical topics in [[number theory]]. They also give rise to very interesting examples of [[Riemannian manifold]]s and hence are objects of interest in [[differential geometry]] and [[topology]]. Finally, these two topics join in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s which is fundamental in modern number theory.

==History==

One of the origins of the mathematical theory of arithmetic groups is algebraic number theory. The classical reduction theory of quadratic and Hermitian forms by [[Charles Hermite]], [[Hermann Minkowski]] and others can be seen as computing [[fundamental domain]]s for the action of certain arithmetic groups on the relevant [[symmetric space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Borel |first=Armand |date=1969 |title=Introduction aux groupes arithmétiques |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=244260 |publisher=Hermann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Carl Ludwig |date=1989 |title=Lectures on the geometry of numbers |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1020761 |publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic was related to Minkowski's [[Geometry of numbers]] and the early development of the study of arithmetic invariant of number fields such as the [[Discriminant of an algebraic number field|discriminant]]. Arithmetic groups can be thought of as a vast generalisation of the [[Dirichlet's unit theorem|unit group]]s of number fields to a noncommutative setting.

The same groups also appeared in analytic number theory as the study of classical modular forms and their generalisations developed. Of course the two topics were related, as can be seen for example in Langlands' computation of the volume of certain fundamental domains using analytic methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Langlands|first= R. P. |chapter=The volume of the fundamental domain for some arithmetical subgroups of Chevalley groups|year= 1966 |title= Algebraic Groups and Discontinuous Subgroups |series=Proc. Sympos. Pure Math.|pages= 143–148 |publisher=Amer. Math. Soc.|publication-place= Providence, R.I. |mr=0213362}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classical theory culminated with the work of Siegel, who showed the finiteness of the volume of a fundamental domain in many cases.

For the modern theory to begin foundational work was needed, and was provided by the work of [[Armand Borel]], [[André Weil]], [[Jacques Tits]] and others on algebraic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Borel | first = Armand| last2 = Tits | first2 = Jacques | date = 1965 | title = Groupes réductifs | url = http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=207712 | journal = Inst. Hautes Études Sci. Publ. Math. | volume = 27 | pages = 55–150 | doi=10.1007/bf02684375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weil |first=André |date=1982 |title=Adèles and algebraic groups |mr=670072 |publisher=Birkhäuser |page=iii+126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards the finiteness of covolume was proven in full generality by Borel and Harish-Chandra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Borel| first=Armand | last2=Harish-Chandra| first2= | date=1962| title=Arithmetic subgroups of algebraic groups| url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=147566 | journal=Annals of Mathematics| volume=75 | issue=3 | pages=485–535 | doi=10.2307/1970210| jstor=1970210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, there was progress on the general theory of lattices in Lie groups by [[Atle Selberg]], [[Grigori Margulis]] and [[David Kazhdan]], [[M. S. Raghunathan]] and others. The state of the art after this period was essentially fixed in Raghunathan's treatise, published in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raghunathan |first=M.S. |date=1972 |title=Discrete subgroups of Lie groups |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=507234 |publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventies Margulis revolutionised the topic by proving that in "most" cases the arithmetic constructions account for all lattices in a given Lie group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Margulis |first=Grigori |title=Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians (Vancouver, B.C., 1974), Vol. 2 |publisher=Canad. Math. Congress, |date=1975 |pages=21–34 |chapter=Discrete groups of motions of manifolds of nonpositive curvature| language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some limited results in this direction had been obtained earlier by Selberg, but Margulis' methods (the use of [[ergodic theory|ergodic-theoretical]] tools for actions on homogeneous spaces) were completely new in this context and were to be extremely influential on later developments, effectively renewing the old subject of geometry of numbers and allowing Margulis himself to prove the [[Oppenheim conjecture]]; stronger results ([[Ratner's theorems]]) were later obtained by [[Marina Ratner]].

In another direction the classical topic of modular forms has blossomed into the modern theory of automorphic forms. The driving force behind this effort is mainly the [[Langlands program]] initiated by [[Robert Langlands]]. One of the main tool used there is the [[Selberg's trace formula|trace formula]] originating in Selberg's work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Selberg | first=Atle | date=1956 | title=Harmonic analysis ans discontinuous groups in weakly symmetric Riemannian spaces with applications to Dirichlet series | url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=88511 | journal=J. Indian Math. Soc. (N.S.) | volume=20 | pages=47–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed in the most general setting by [[James Arthur (mathematician)|James Arthur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Arthur |first=James |title=Harmonic analysis, the trace formula, and Shimura varieties | publisher=Amer. Math. soc | date=2005 | pages=1–263 | chapter=An introduction to the trace formula}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally arithmetic groups are often used to construct interesting examples of [[locally symmetric space|locally symmetric]] Riemannian manifolds. A particularly active research topic has been [[arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s, which as [[William Thurston]] wrote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Thurston | first=William | date=1982 | title=Three-dimensional manifolds, Kleinian groups and hyperbolic geometry | url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=648524 | journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) | volume=6 | issue=3 | pages=357–381 | doi=10.1090/s0273-0979-1982-15003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...often seem to have special beauty."

== Definition and construction ==

=== Arithmetic groups ===

If &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G&lt;/math&gt; is an algebraic subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}_n(\Q)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; then we can define an arithmetic subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G(\Q)&lt;/math&gt; as the group of integer points &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \mathrm{GL}_n(\Z) \cap \mathrm G(\Q).&lt;/math&gt; In general it is not so obvious how to make precise sense of the notion of "integer points" of a &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;-group, and the subgroup defined above can change when we take different embeddings &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G \to \mathrm{GL}_n(\Q).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a better notion is to take for definition of an arithmetic subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G(\Q)&lt;/math&gt; any group &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; which is [[commensurability (group theory)|commensurable]] (this means that both &lt;math&gt;\Gamma/(\Gamma\cap \Lambda)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda/(\Gamma \cap \Lambda)&lt;/math&gt; are finite sets) to a group &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; defined as above (with respect to any embedding into &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{GL}_n&lt;/math&gt;). With this definition, to the algebraic group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G&lt;/math&gt; is associated a collection of "discrete" subgroups all commensurable to each other.

=== Using number fields ===

A natural generalisation of the construction above is as follows: let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a [[number field]] with ring of integers &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G&lt;/math&gt; an algebraic group over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. If we are given an embedding &lt;math&gt;\rho : \mathrm{G} \to \mathrm{GL}_n&lt;/math&gt; defined over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; then the subgroup &lt;math&gt;\rho^{-1}(\mathrm{GL}_n(O)) \subset \mathrm G(F)&lt;/math&gt; can legitimately be called an arithmetic group.

On the other hand, the class of groups thus obtained is not larger than the class of arithmetic groups as defined above. Indeed, if we consider the algebraic group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G'&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; obtained by [[Weil restriction|restricting scalars]] from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\Q &lt;/math&gt;-embedding &lt;math&gt;\rho' : \mathrm G' \to \mathrm{GL}_{dn}&lt;/math&gt; induced by &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;d = [F:\Q ]&lt;/math&gt;) then the group constructed above is equal to &lt;math&gt;(\rho')^{-1}(\mathrm{GL}_{nd}(\Z))&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

The classical example of an arithmetic group is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_n(\Z)&lt;/math&gt;, or the closely related groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_n(\Z)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}_n(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PGL}_n(\Z)&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt; the group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\Z)&lt;/math&gt;, or sometimes &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_n(\Z)&lt;/math&gt;, is called the [[modular group]] as it is related to the [[modular curve]]. Similar examples are the [[Siegel modular form|Siegel modular groups]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Sp}_{2g}(\Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

Other well-known and studied examples include the [[Bianchi group]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(O_{-m}),&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is a square-free integer and &lt;math&gt;O_{-m}&lt;/math&gt; is the ring of integers in the field &lt;math&gt;\Q(\sqrt{-m}),&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Hilbert modular form|Hilbert—Blumenthal modular groups]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(O_m)&lt;/math&gt;.

Another classical example is given by the integral elements in the orthogonal group of a quadratic form defined over a number field, for example &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO}(n,1)(\Z )&lt;/math&gt;. A related construction is by taking the unit groups of [[order (ring theory)|orders]] in [[quaternion algebra]]s over number fields (for example the [[Hurwitz quaternion order]]). Similar constructions can be performed with unitary groups of [[hermitian form]]s, a well-known example is the [[Picard modular group]].

== Arithmetic lattices in semisimple Lie groups ==

When &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie group one can define an arithmetic lattice in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as follows: for any algebraic groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G&lt;/math&gt; defined over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; such that there is a morphism &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G(\R) \to G&lt;/math&gt; with compact kernel, the image of an arithmetic subgroup in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G(\Q)&lt;/math&gt; is an arithmetic lattice in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, for example, if &lt;math&gt;G = \mathrm G(\R)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}_n&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;G \cap \mathrm{GL}_n(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; is an arithmetic lattice in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (but there are many more, corresponding to other embeddings); for instance, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_n(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; is an arithmetic lattice in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_n(\R )&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The Borel–Harish-Chandra theorem ===

A [[Lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in a Lie group is usually defined as a discrete subgroup with finite covolume. The terminology introduced above is coherent with this, as a theorem due to Borel and Harish-Chandra states that an arithmetic subgroup in a semisimple Lie group is of finite covolume (the discreteness is obvious).

The theorem is more precise: it tells that the arithmetic lattice is cocompact if and only if the "form" of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; used to define it (i.e. the &lt;math&gt;\Q &lt;/math&gt;-group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G&lt;/math&gt;) is anisotropic. For example, the arithmetic lattice associated to a quadratic form in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; will be co-compact in the associated orthogonal group if and only if the quadratic form does not vanish at any point in &lt;math&gt;\Q^n \setminus \{ 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Margulis arithmeticity theorem ===

The spectacular result that Margulis obtained is a partial converse to the Borel—Harish-Chandra theorem: for certain Lie groups ''any'' lattice is arithmetic. This result is true for all irreducible lattice in semisimple Lie groups of real rank larger than two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Margulis |first=Girgori |date=1991 |title=Discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups |publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Witte-Morris |first=Dave |date=2015 |title=Introduction to arithmetic groups |chapter=16 |url=http://deductivepress.ca/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, all lattices in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_n(\R )&lt;/math&gt; are arithmetic when &lt;math&gt;n \ge 3&lt;/math&gt;. The main new ingredient that Margulis used to prove his theorem was the [[superrigidity]] of lattices in higher-rank groups that he proved for this purpose.

Irreducibility only plays a rôle when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has a factor of real rank one (otherwise the theorem always holds) and is not simple: it means that for any product decomposition &lt;math&gt;G = G_1\times G_2&lt;/math&gt; the lattice is not commensurable to a product of lattices in each of the factors &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the lattice &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\Z [\sqrt 2])&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\R) \times \mathrm{SL}_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible, while &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\Z) \times \mathrm{SL}_2(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; is not.

The Margulis arithmeticity (and superrigidity) theorem holds for certain rank 1 Lie groups, namely &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Sp}(n,1)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n \geqslant 1 &lt;/math&gt; and the exceptional group &lt;math&gt;F_4^{-20}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gromov | first1=Mikhail | last2=Schoen | first2=Richard | title=Harmonic maps into singular spaces and p-adic superrigidity for lattices in groups of rank one | journal=Inst. Hautes Études Sci. Publ.

There are no known non-arithmetic lattices in the groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU}(n,1)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;n \geqslant 4&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Arithmetic Fuchsian and Kleinian groups ===
{{Main|Arithmetic Fuchsian group}}
{{Main| Arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold}}

An arithmetic Fuchsian group is constructed from the following data: a [[totally real number field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, a [[quaternion algebra]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and an order &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. It is asked that for one embedding &lt;math&gt;\sigma: F \to \R&lt;/math&gt; the algebra &lt;math&gt;A^\sigma \otimes_F \R&lt;/math&gt; be isomorphic to the matrix algebra &lt;math&gt;M_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt; and for all others to the [[Hamilton quaternions]]. Then the group of units &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O^1&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice in &lt;math&gt;(A^\sigma \otimes_F \R)^1&lt;/math&gt; which is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\R),&lt;/math&gt; and it is co-compact in all cases except when &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix algebra over &lt;math&gt;\Q.&lt;/math&gt; All arithmetic lattices in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt; are obtained in this way (up to commensurability).

Arithmetic Kleinian groups are constructed similarly except that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is required to have exactly one complex place and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be the Hamilton quaternions at all real places. They exhaust all arithmetic commensurability classes in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\Complex).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Classification ===

For every semisimple Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; it is in theory possible to classify (up to commensurability) all arithmetic lattices in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, in a manner similar to the cases &lt;math&gt;G = \mathrm{SL}_2(\R), \mathrm{SL}_2(\Complex)&lt;/math&gt; explained above. This amounts to classifying the algebraic groups whose real points are isomorphic up to a compact factor to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Witte-Morris |first=Dave |date=2015 |title=Introduction to arithmetic groups |chapter=18 |url=http://deductivepress.ca/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The congruence subgroup problem ===
{{Main|Congruence subgroup}}

A [[congruence subgroup]] is (roughly) a subgroup of an arithmetic group defined by taking all matrices satisfying certain equations modulo an integer, for example the group of 2 by 2 integer matrices with diagonal (respectively off-diagonal) coefficients congruent to 1 (respectively 0) modulo a positive integer. These are always finite-index subgroups and the congruence subgroup problem roughly asks whether all subgroups are obtained in this way. The conjecture (usually attributed to [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] is that this is true for (irreducible) arithmetic lattices in higher-rank groups and false in rank-one groups. It is still open in this generality but there are many results establishing it for specific lattices (in both its positive and negative cases).

== &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-arithmetic groups ==

Instead of taking integral points in the definition of an arithmetic lattice one can take points which are only integral away from a finite number of primes. This leads to the notion of an ''&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-arithmetic lattice'' (where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; stands for the set of primes inverted). The prototypical example is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2 \left( \Z \left[\tfrac 1 p \right] \right)&lt;/math&gt;. They are also naturally lattices in certain topological groups, for example &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2 \left( \Z \left[\tfrac 1 p \right] \right)&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\R) \times \mathrm{SL}_2(\Q_p).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Definition ===

The formal definition of an &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-arithmetic group for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; a finite set of prime numbers is the same as for arithmetic groups with &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}_n(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; replaced by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}_n\left(\Z \left[ \tfrac 1 N \right] \right)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the product of the primes in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Lattices in Lie groups over local fields ===

The Borel–Harish-Chandra theorem generalizes to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-arithmetic groups as follows: if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-arithmetic group in a &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;-algebraic group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice in the locally compact group

:&lt;math&gt;G = \mathrm G(\R) \times \prod_{p\in S} \mathrm G(\Q_p)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Some applications ==

=== Explicit expander graphs ===

Arithmetic groups with [[Kazhdan's property (T)]] or the weaker property (&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;) of Lubotzky and Zimmer can be used to construct expander graphs (Margulis), or even [[Ramanujan graphs]](Lubotzky—Phillips—Sarnak&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lubotzky |first=Alexander |title=Discrete groups, expanding graphs and invariant measures |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sarnak |first=Peter |date=1990 |title=Some applications of modular forms| publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Such graphs are known to exist in abundance by probabilistic results but the explicit nature of these constructions makes them interesting.

=== Extremal surfaces and graphs ===

Congruence covers of arithmetic surfaces are known to give rise to surfaces with large [[injectivity radius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last1 = Katz | first1 = Mikhail G. | author1-link = Mikhail Katz | last2 = Schaps | first2 = Mary| last3 = Vishne | first3 = Uzi | author3-link = Uzi Vishne| arxiv = math.DG/0505007 | mr = 2331526 | issue = 3 | journal = Journal of Differential Geometry | pages = 399–422 | title = Logarithmic growth of systole of arithmetic Riemann surfaces along congruence subgroups | url = http://projecteuclid.org/getRecord?id=euclid.jdg/1180135693 | volume = 76 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the Ramanujan graphs constructed by Lubotzky—Phillips—Sarnak have large [[girth (graph theory)|girth]]. It is in fact known that the Ramanujan property itself implies that the local girths of the graph are almost always large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Abért | first1=Mikl&amp;oacute;s |last2=Glasner | first2=Yair | last3 = Vir&amp;aacute;g | first3=B&amp;aacute;lint | title=Kesten's theorem for invariant random subgroups | journal=Duke Math.

=== Isospectral manifolds ===

Arithmetic groups can be used to construct [[Isospectral geometry|isospectral manifolds]]. This was first realised by [[Marie-France Vignéras]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Vignéras | first=Marie-France | title=Variétés riemanniennes isospectrales et non isométriques | language=French | journal=Ann. of Math. | volume=112 | date=1980 | pages=21–32 | doi=10.2307/1971319| jstor=1971319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous variations on her construction have appeared since. The isospectrality problem is in fact particularly amenable to study in the restricted setting of arithmetic manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Prasad | first1=Gopal | last2=Rapinchuk | first2=Andrei S. | title=Weakly commensurable arithmetic groups and isospectral locally symmetric spaces | journal=Publ. Math. Inst. Hautes Études Sci. | volume=109 | date=2009| pages=113–184 |mr=2511587 | doi=10.1007/s10240-009-0019-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fake projective planes ===

A fake projective plane&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Rémy | first=Bertrand | title=COVOLUME DES GROUPES S-ARITHMÉTIQUES ET FAUX PLANS PROJECTIFS [d'après Mumford, Prasad, Klingler, Yeung, Prasad-Yeung] | publication-place =séminaire Bourbaki | date=2007–2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[complex surface]] which has the same [[Betti number]]s as the [[Projective space|projective plane]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb P^2(\Complex)&lt;/math&gt; but is not biholomorhic to it; the first example was discovered by Mumford. By work of Klingler (also proved independently by Yeung) all such are quotients of the 2-ball by arithmetic lattices in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PU}(2,1)&lt;/math&gt;. The possible lattices have been classified by Prasad and Yeung and the classification was completed by Cartwright and Steger who checked that they actually correspond to fake projective planes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25501">In mathematics, the '''base change theorems''' relate the [[Direct image functor|direct image]] and the [[Pullback (category theory)|pull-back]] of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]]. More precisely, they are about the base change map, given by the following [[natural transformation]] of sheaves:

:&lt;math&gt;g^*(R^r f_* \mathcal{F}) \to R^r f'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl} X' &amp; \stackrel{g'}\to &amp; X \\
f' \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow f \\
S' &amp; \stackrel g \to &amp; S \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[Cartesian square (category theory)|Cartesian square]] of topological spaces and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a sheaf on ''X''.

Such theorems exist in different branches of geometry: for (essentially arbitrary) topological spaces and proper maps ''f'', in [[algebraic geometry]] for (quasi-)coherent sheaves and ''f'' proper or ''g'' flat, similarly in [[analytic geometry]], but also for [[étale sheaf|étale sheaves]] for ''f'' proper or ''g'' smooth.

== Introduction ==
A simple base change phenomenon arises in [[commutative algebra]] when ''A'' is a [[commutative ring]] and ''B'' and ''A' ''are two ''A''-algebras. Let &lt;math&gt;B' = B \otimes_A A'&lt;/math&gt;. In this situation, given a ''B''-module ''M'', there is an isomorphism (of ''A' ''-modules):

:&lt;math&gt;(M \otimes_B B')_{A'} \cong (M_A) \otimes_A A'.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the subscript indicates the forgetful functor, i.e., &lt;math&gt;M_A&lt;/math&gt; is ''M'', but regarded as an ''A''-module.
Indeed, such an isomorphism is obtained by observing 

:&lt;math&gt;M \otimes_B B' = M \otimes_B B \otimes_A A' \cong M \otimes_A A'.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the two operations, namely forgetful functors and tensor products commute in the sense of the above isomorphism.
The base change theorems discussed below are statements of a similar kind.

== Definition of the base change map ==
{{Images of sheaves}}
The base change theorems presented below all assert that (for different types of sheaves, and under various assumptions on the maps involved), that the following ''base change map''

:&lt;math&gt;g^*(R^r f_* \mathcal{F}) \to R^r f'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;

is an isomorphism, where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl} X' &amp; \stackrel{g'}\to &amp; X \\
f' \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow f \\
S' &amp; \stackrel g \to &amp; S\\ \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

are continuous maps between topological spaces that form a [[Cartesian square (category theory)|Cartesian square]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a sheaf on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;
The roles of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are symmetric, and in some contexts (especially smooth base change) the more familiar formulation is the other one (dealing instead with the map &lt;math&gt;f^* R^i g_* \mathcal G \rightarrow R^i g'_* f'^* \mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; a sheaf on &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt;). For consistency, the results in this article below are all stated for the '''same''' situation, namely the map &lt;math&gt;g^* R^i f_* \mathcal F \rightarrow R^i f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;; but readers should be sure to check this against their expectations.&lt;/ref&gt; Here &lt;math&gt;R^i f_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[higher direct image]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; under ''f'', i.e., the [[derived functor]] of the direct image (also known as pushforward) functor &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt;.

This map exists without any assumptions on the maps ''f'' and ''g''. It is constructed as follows: since &lt;math&gt;g'^*&lt;/math&gt; is [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] to &lt;math&gt;g'_*&lt;/math&gt;, there is a natural map (called unit map)
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id} \to g'_* \circ g'^*&lt;/math&gt;
and so 

:&lt;math&gt;R^r f_* \to R^r f_* \circ g'_* \circ g'^*.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Grothendieck spectral sequence]] then gives the first map and the last map (they are edge maps) in:

:&lt;math&gt;R^r f_* \circ g'_* \circ g'^* \to R^r(f \circ g')_* \circ g'^* = R^r(g \circ f')_* \circ g'^* \to g_* \circ R^r f'_* \circ g'^*.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining this with the above yields

:&lt;math&gt;R^r f_* \to g_* \circ R^r f'_* \circ g'^*.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the adjointness of &lt;math&gt;g^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_*&lt;/math&gt; finally yields the desired map.

The above-mentioned introductory example is a special case of this, namely for the [[affine spectrum|affine spectra]] &lt;math&gt;X = \operatorname{Spec} (B), S = \operatorname{Spec} (A), S' = \operatorname{Spec} (A')&lt;/math&gt; and, consequently, &lt;math&gt;X' = \operatorname{Spec} (B')&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[quasi-coherent sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F := \tilde M&lt;/math&gt; associated to the ''B''-module ''M''.

It is conceptually convenient to organize the above base change maps, which only involve only a single higher direct image functor, into one which encodes all &lt;math&gt;R^r f_*&lt;/math&gt; at a time. In fact, similar arguments as above yield a map in the [[derived category]] of sheaves on ''S':''

:&lt;math&gt;g^* Rf_* (\mathcal{F}) \to Rf'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Rf_*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the (total) derived functor of &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt;.

== General topology ==
===Proper base change===
If ''X'' is a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological space]], ''S'' is a [[locally compact space|locally compact]] Hausdorff space and ''f'' is universally closed (i.e., &lt;math&gt;X \times_S T \to T&lt;/math&gt; is a [[closed map]] for any continuous map &lt;math&gt;T \to S&lt;/math&gt;), then
the base change map

:&lt;math&gt;g^* R^r f_* \mathcal F \to R^r f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;

is an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Milne|2012|loc=Theorem 17.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, we have: for &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;(R^r f_* \mathcal{F})_s = \varinjlim H^r(U, \mathcal{F}) = H^r(X_s, \mathcal{F}), \quad X_s = f^{-1}(s)&lt;/math&gt;

and so for &lt;math&gt;s = g(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g^* (R^r f_* \mathcal{F})_t = H^r(X_s, \mathcal{F}) = H^r(X'_t, g'^* \mathcal{F}) = R^r f'_* (g'^* \mathcal{F})_t.&lt;/math&gt;

To encode all individual higher derived functors of &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt; into one entity, the above statement may equivalently be rephrased by saying that the base change map

:&lt;math&gt;g^* Rf_* \mathcal F \to Rf'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

The assumptions that the involved spaces be Hausdorff have been weakened by {{harvtxt|Schnürer|Soergel|2016}}.

{{harvtxt|Lurie|2009}} has extended the above theorem to [[non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian sheaf cohomology]], i.e., sheaves taking values in [[simplicial set]]s (as opposed to abelian groups).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lurie|2009|loc=Theorem 7.3.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct image with compact support===
If the map ''f'' is not closed, the base change map need not be an isomorphism, as the following example shows (the maps are the standard inclusions) :

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
\emptyset &amp; \stackrel {g'} \to &amp; \mathbb C \setminus \{0\} \\
f' \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow f \\
\{0\} &amp; \stackrel g \to &amp; \mathbb C
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

One the one hand &lt;math&gt;f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is always zero, but if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is a [[local system]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C \setminus \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to a [[Group representation|representation]] of the [[fundamental group]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X)&lt;/math&gt; (which is isomorphic to '''Z'''), then &lt;math&gt;g^* f_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; can be computed as the [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s of the [[monodromy]] action of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X, x)&lt;/math&gt; on the [[stalk (sheaf)|stalk]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F_x&lt;/math&gt; (for any &lt;math&gt;x \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;), which need not vanish.

To obtain a base-change result, the functor &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt; (or its derived functor) has to be replaced by the [[direct image with compact support]] &lt;math&gt;Rf_!&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if &lt;math&gt;f: X \to S&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion of an open subset, such as in the above example, &lt;math&gt;Rf_! \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is the extension by zero, i.e., its stalks are given by

:&lt;math&gt;(Rf_! \mathcal F)_s = \begin{cases} \mathcal F_s &amp; s \in X, \\ 0 &amp; s \notin X. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

In general, there is a map &lt;math&gt;Rf_! \mathcal F \to Rf_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;, which is a quasi-isomorphism if ''f'' is proper, but not in general. The proper base change theorem mentioned above has the following generalization: there is a quasi-isomorphism&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Iversen|1986}}, the four spaces are assumed to be [[locally compact]] and of finite dimension.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g^* Rf_! \mathcal F \to Rf'_! g'^* \mathcal F.&lt;/math&gt;

==Base change for quasi-coherent sheaves==

===Proper base change===
''Proper base change theorems'' for [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent sheaves]] apply in the following situation: &lt;math&gt;f: X \to S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[proper morphism]] between [[noetherian scheme]]s, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[coherent sheaf]] which is [[flat morphism|flat]] over ''S'' (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F_x&lt;/math&gt; is [[flat module|flat]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O_{S, f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;). In this situation, the following statements hold:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1963|loc=Section 7.7}}, {{harvtxt|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Theorem III.12.11}}, {{harvtxt|Vakil|2015|loc=Chapter 28 ''Cohomology and base change theorems''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Semicontinuity theorem":
** For each &lt;math&gt;p \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;s \mapsto \dim_{k(s)} H^p (X_s, \mathcal{F}_s): S \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is upper [[semicontinuous]].
** The function &lt;math&gt;s \mapsto \chi(\mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt; is locally constant, where &lt;math&gt;\chi(\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Euler characteristic]].
* If ''S'' is reduced and connected, then for each &lt;math&gt;p \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; the following are equivalent
**&lt;math&gt;s \mapsto \dim_{k(s)} H^p (X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt; is constant.
** &lt;math&gt;R^p f_* \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is locally free and the natural map
::&lt;math&gt;R^p f_* \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_S} k(s) \to H^p(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
:Furthermore, if these conditions hold, then the natural map
::&lt;math&gt;R^{p-1} f_* \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_S} k(s) \to H^{p-1}(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
* If, for some ''p'', &lt;math&gt;H^p(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;, then the natural map
::&lt;math&gt;R^{p-1} f_* \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_S} k(s) \to H^{p-1}(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;.

As the [[stalk (mathematics)|stalk]] of the sheaf &lt;math&gt;R^p f_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is closely related to the cohomology of the fiber of the point under ''f'', this statement is paraphrased by saying that "cohomology commutes with base extension".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Hartshorne | 1977 | p=255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These statements are proved using the following fact, where in addition to the above assumptions &lt;math&gt;S = \operatorname{Spec} A&lt;/math&gt;: there is a finite complex &lt;math&gt;0 \to K^0 \to K^1 \to \cdots \to K^n \to 0&lt;/math&gt; of [[finitely generated projective module|finitely generated projective ''A''-modules]] and a natural isomorphism of functors
:&lt;math&gt;H^p(X \times_S \operatorname{Spec} -, \mathcal{F} \otimes_A -) \to H^p(K^\bullet \otimes_A -), p \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
on the category of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-algebras.

===Flat base change===
The base change map
:&lt;math&gt;g^*(R^r f_* \mathcal{F}) \to R^r f'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;
is an isomorphism for a [[quasi-coherent sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; (on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;), provided that the map &lt;math&gt;g: S' \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is ''[[flat morphism|flat]]'' (together with a number of technical conditions: ''f'' needs to be a [[separated morphism|separated]] [[morphism of finite type]], the schemes involved need to be Noetherian).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Proposition III.9.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flat base change in the derived category====
A far reaching extension of flat base change is possible when considering the base change map
:&lt;math&gt;Lg^* Rf_* (\mathcal{F}) \to Rf'_*(Lg'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;
in the derived category of sheaves on ''S','' similarly as mentioned above. Here &lt;math&gt;Lg^*&lt;/math&gt; is the (total) derived functor of the pullback of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt;-modules (because &lt;math&gt;g^* \mathcal G = \mathcal O_X \otimes_{g^{-1} \mathcal O_S} g^{-1} \mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; involves a tensor product, &lt;math&gt;g^*&lt;/math&gt; is not exact when {{math|''g''}} is not flat and therefore is not equal to its derived functor &lt;math&gt;Lg^*&lt;/math&gt;).
This map is a quasi-isomorphism provided that the following conditions are satisfied:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Berthelot|Grothendieck|Illusie|1971|loc=SGA 6 IV, Proposition 3.1.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is quasi-compact and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is quasi-compact and quasi-separated,
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is an object in &lt;math&gt;D^b(\mathcal{O}_X\text{-mod})&lt;/math&gt;, the bounded derived category of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;-modules, and its cohomology sheaves are quasi-coherent (for example, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; could be a bounded complex of quasi-coherent sheaves)
* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are ''Tor-independent'' over &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that if &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s' \in S'&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;f(x) = s = g(s')&lt;/math&gt;, then for all integers &lt;math&gt;p \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tor}^p_{\mathcal{O}_{S,s}}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{O}_{S',s'}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* One of the following conditions is satisfied:
** &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; has finite flat amplitude relative to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that it is quasi-isomorphic in &lt;math&gt;D^-(f^{-1}\mathcal O_S\text{-mod})&lt;/math&gt; to a complex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal F')^i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\mathcal O_S&lt;/math&gt;-flat for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; outside some bounded interval &lt;math&gt;[m, n]&lt;/math&gt;; equivalently, there exists an interval &lt;math&gt;[m, n]&lt;/math&gt; such that for any complex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;D^-(f^{-1}\mathcal O_S\text{-mod})&lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tor}_i(\mathcal F, \mathcal G) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; outside &lt;math&gt;[m, n]&lt;/math&gt;; or
** &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has finite Tor-dimension, meaning that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{S'}&lt;/math&gt; has finite flat amplitude relative to &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

One advantage of this formulation is that the flatness hypothesis has been weakened.  However, making concrete computations of the cohomology of the left- and right-hand sides now requires the [[Grothendieck spectral sequence]].

===Base change in derived algebraic geometry===
[[Derived algebraic geometry]] provides a means to drop the flatness assumption, provided that the pullback &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the [[homotopy pullback]]. In the easiest case when ''X'', ''S'', and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are affine (with the notation as above), the homotopy pullback is given by the [[derived functor|derived]] tensor product
:&lt;math&gt;X' = \operatorname{Spec} (B' \otimes^L_B A)&lt;/math&gt;
Then, assuming that the schemes (or, more generally, derived schemes) involved are quasi-compact and quasi-separated, the natural transformation
:&lt;math&gt;L g^* R f_* \mathcal{F} \to Rf'_* Lg'^* \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] for any quasi-coherent sheaf, or more generally a [[chain complex|complex]] of quasi-coherent sheaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Toën|2012|loc=Proposition 1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The afore-mentioned flat base change result is in fact a special case since for ''g'' flat the homotopy pullback (which is locally given by a derived tensor product) agrees with the ordinary pullback (locally given by the underived tensor product), and since the pullback along the flat maps ''g'' and ''g' ''are automatically derived (i.e., &lt;math&gt;Lg^* = g^*&lt;/math&gt;). The auxiliary assumptions related to the Tor-independence or Tor-amplitude in the preceding base change theorem also become unnecessary.

In the above form, base change has been extended by {{harvtxt|Ben-Zvi|Francis|Nadler|2010}} to the situation where ''X'', ''S'', and ''S' ''are (possibly derived) [[stack (mathematics)|stack]]s, provided that the map ''f'' is a perfect map (which includes the case that ''f'' is a quasi-compact, quasi-separated map of schemes, but also includes more general stacks, such as the [[classifying stack]] ''BG'' of an [[algebraic group]] in characteristic zero).

===Variants and applications===
Proper base change also holds in the context of [[complex manifolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grauert|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[theorem on formal functions]] is a variant of the proper base change, where the pullback is replaced by a [[completion (metric space)|completion]] operation.

The [[see-saw principle]] and the [[theorem of the cube]], which are foundational facts in the theory of [[abelian varieties]], are a consequence of proper base change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mumford|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A base-change also holds for [[D-modules]]: if ''X'', ''S'', ''X','' and ''S' ''are smooth varieties (but ''f'' and ''g'' need not be flat or proper etc.), there is a quasi-isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;g^\dagger \int_f \mathcal F \to \int_{f'} g'^\dagger \mathcal F,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;-^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int&lt;/math&gt; denote the inverse and direct image functors for ''D''-modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hotta|Takeuchi|Tanisaki|2008|loc=Theorem 1.7.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Base change for étale sheaves==
For [[étale sheaf|étale torsion sheaves]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;, there are two base change results referred to as ''proper'' and ''smooth base change'', respectively: base change holds if &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is [[proper morphism|proper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|Grothendieck|Verdier|1972|loc=Exposé XII}}, {{harvtxt|Milne|1980|loc=section VI.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds if ''g'' is [[smooth morphism|smooth]], provided that ''f'' is quasi-compact and provided that the torsion of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is prime to the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the [[residue field]]s of ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|Grothendieck|Verdier|1972|loc=Exposé XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related to proper base change is the following fact (the two theorems are usually proved simultaneously): let ''X'' be a variety over a [[separably closed field]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; a [[constructible sheaf]] on &lt;math&gt;X_\text{et}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;H^r(X, \mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; are finite in each of the following cases:
*''X'' is complete, or 
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; has no ''p''-torsion, where ''p'' is the characteristic of ''k''.

Under additional assumptions, {{harvtxt|Deninger|1988}} extended the proper base change theorem to non-torsion étale sheaves.

===Applications===
In close analogy to the topological situation mentioned above, the base change map for an [[open immersion]] ''f'', 
:&lt;math&gt;g^* f_* \mathcal F \to f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;
is not usually an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Milne|2012|loc=Example 8.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the [[extension by zero]] functor &lt;math&gt;f_!&lt;/math&gt; satisfies an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;g^* f_! \mathcal F \to f'_! g^* \mathcal F.&lt;/math&gt;
This fact and the proper base change suggest to define the ''direct image functor with compact support'' for a map ''f'' by
:&lt;math&gt;Rf_! := Rp_* j_!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f = p \circ j&lt;/math&gt; is a ''compactification'' of ''f'', i.e., a factorization into an open immersion followed by a proper map.
The proper base change theorem is needed to show that this is well-defined, i.e., independent (up to isomorphism) of the choice of the compactification.
Moreover, again in analogy to the case of sheaves on a topological space, a base change formula for &lt;math&gt;g_*&lt;/math&gt; vs. &lt;math&gt;Rf_!&lt;/math&gt; does hold for non-proper maps ''f''.

For the structural map &lt;math&gt;f: X \to S = \operatorname{Spec} k&lt;/math&gt; of a scheme over a field ''k'', the individual cohomologies of &lt;math&gt;Rf_! (\mathcal F)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;H^*_c(X, \mathcal F)&lt;/math&gt; referred to as [[cohomology with compact support]]. It is an important variant of usual [[étale cohomology]].

Similar ideas are also used to construct an analogue of the functor &lt;math&gt;Rf_!&lt;/math&gt; in [[A1 homotopy theory|'''A'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-homotopy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ayoub|first=Joseph|title=Les six opérations de Grothendieck et le formalisme des cycles évanescents dans le monde motivique.

'''Benson's algorithm''', named after [[Harold Benson]], is a method for solving [[multi-objective linear programming]] problems and vector linear programs.  This works by finding the "efficient extreme points in the outcome set".&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Harold P. Benson | year = 1998 | title = An Outer Approximation Algorithm for Generating All Efficient Extreme Points in the Outcome Set of a Multiple Objective Linear Programming Problem | journal = Journal of Global Optimization | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–24 | doi = 10.1023/A:1008215702611 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1008215702611 | format =  | accessdate = September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary concept in Benson's algorithm is to evaluate the upper image of the [[vector optimization]] problem by [[cutting-plane method|cutting planes]].&lt;ref name="Lohne"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vector Optimization with Infimum and Supremum|author=Andreas Löhne|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=9783642183508|pages=162–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Idea of algorithm ==
Consider a vector linear program
:&lt;math&gt;\min_C Px \; \text{ subject to }  A x \geq b&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;P \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b \in \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; and a polyhedral convex ordering cone &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; having nonempty interior and containing no lines. The feasible set is &lt;math&gt;S=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n:\; A x \geq b\}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, Benson's algorithm finds the [[extreme point]]s of the set &lt;math&gt;P[S] + C&lt;/math&gt;, which is called upper image.&lt;ref name="Lohne"/&gt;

In case of &lt;math&gt;C=\mathbb{R}^q_+:=\{y \in \mathbb{R}^q : y_1 \geq 0,\dots, y_q \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains the special case of a multi-objective linear program ([[multiobjective optimization]]).

== Dual algorithm ==
There is a dual variant of Benson's algorithm,&lt;ref name="EhrgottLöhne2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehrgott|first1=Matthias|last2=Löhne|first2=Andreas|last3=Shao|first3=Lizhen|title=A dual variant of Benson’s "outer approximation algorithm" for multiple objective linear programming|journal=Journal of Global Optimization|volume=52|issue=4|year=2011|pages=757–778|issn=0925-5001|doi=10.1007/s10898-011-9709-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on geometric duality&lt;ref name="HeydeLöhne2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyde|first1=Frank|last2=Löhne|first2=Andreas|title=Geometric Duality in Multiple Objective Linear Programming|journal=SIAM Journal on Optimization|volume=19|issue=2|year=2008|pages=836–845|issn=1052-6234|doi=10.1137/060674831|url=http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/serien/e/reports_Halle-Wittenberg_math/06-15report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; for multi-objective linear programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4375">In quantified [[modal logic]], the '''Buridan formula''' and the '''converse Buridan formula''' (more accurately, schemata rather than formulas) (i) syntactically state principles of interchange between quantifiers and modalities; (ii) semantically state a relation between domains of possible worlds. The formulas are named in honor of the medieval philosopher [[Jean Buridan]] by analogy with the [[Barcan formula]] and the [[converse Barcan formula]] introduced as axioms by [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garson, James W.|chapter=Quantification in modal logic|title=Handbook of philosophical logic|volume=vol. 3|publisher=Springer Netherlands|year=2001|pages=267–323| chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-0454-0_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Buridan formula ==
The Buridan formula is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Diamond \forall x Fx \rightarrow \forall x\Diamond  Fx&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.rml/1317305581|author=Anellis, I.

In [[English language|English]], the schema reads: If possibly everything is F, then everything is possibly F. It is equivalent in a [[classical modal logic]] (but not necessarily in other formulations of modal logic) to

:&lt;math&gt;\Box\exists x \neg Fx\to\exists x\Box \neg Fx&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9kMqQTs3ITcC&amp;pg=PA190|author=Besnard, P.|author2=Guinnebault, J. M.|author3=Mayer, E.|year=1997|chapter=Propositional quantification for conditional logic|title=''In'' Qualitative and Quantitative Practical Reasoning|pages=183–197|publisher= Springer Berlin Heidelberg}} See page 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The converse Buridan formula ==
The converse Buridan formula is:

&lt;math&gt;\forall x\Diamond  Fx \rightarrow \Diamond \forall x Fx&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPx2e9xDjLwC&amp;pg=PA60|author=Richards, Jay W.|title=The Untamed God: A Philosophical Exploration of Divine Perfection, Simplicity and Immutability|page=60|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buridan's logic ==
{{blockquote|... As well as providing running commentaries on Aristotle's texts, Buridan wrote particularly influential question-commentaries, a typical genre of the medieval scholastic output, in which authors systematically discussed the most problematic issues raised by the text on which they were lecturing. The question-format allowed Buridan, using the conceptual tools he developed in his works on logic, to work out in detail his characteristically [[nominalism|nominalist]] take on practically all aspects of Aristotelian philosophy. Among his logical works (which also comprise a number of important question-commentaries on Aristotle's logical writings), two stand out for their originality and significance: the short ''Treatise on Consequences'', which provides a systematic account of Buridan's theory of inferences, and the much larger ''Summulae de Dialectica'', Buridan's monumental work covering all aspects of his logical theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Klima, Gyula|title=John Buridan|year=2008|publisher=Oxford U. Press|pages=3–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lh6ePL88c2kC&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In medieval scholasticism, nominalists held that universals exist only subsequent to particular things or pragmatic circumstances, while [[Philosophical realism|realists]] followed Plato in asserting that universals exist independently of, and superior to, particular things.

{{blockquote|... Buridan wrote his ''Summulae de Dialectica'', which was to become the primary textbook of ''nominalist'' logic at European universities for about two centuries, in the form of a running commentary on the enormously influential logic tract of the venerable ''realist'' master, [[Peter of Spain]]. However, for the purposes of his commentary, Buridan completely reorganized Peter's treatise, and where Peter's realist doctrine went against his own nominalism, he simply replaced Peter's text with his own. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Klima, Gyula|title=John Buridan|year=2008|publisher=Oxford U.

In [[mathematics]], the '''classification of the finite [[Simple group|simple groups]]''' is a theorem stating that every [[List of finite simple groups|finite simple group]] belongs to one of four broad classes described below. These [[group (mathematics)|groups]] can be seen as the basic building blocks of all [[finite group]]s, in a way reminiscent of the way the [[prime number]]s are the basic building blocks of the [[natural number]]s.  The [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] is a more precise way of stating this fact about finite groups. However, a significant difference from  [[integer factorization]] is that such "building blocks" do not necessarily determine  a unique group, since there might be many non-[[isomorphic]] groups with the same [[composition series]] or, put in another way, the [[group extension#Extension problem|extension problem]] does not have a unique solution.

[[Group theory]] is central to many areas of pure and applied mathematics and the classification theorem is one of the great achievements of modern mathematics. The proof consists of tens of thousands of pages in several hundred journal articles written by about 100 authors, published mostly between 1955 and 2004. [[Daniel Gorenstein|Gorenstein]] (d.1992), [[Richard Lyons (mathematician)|Lyons]], and [[Ronald Solomon|Solomon]] are gradually publishing a simplified and revised version of the proof.

==Statement of the classification theorem==
{{Main|List of finite simple groups}}
{{math_theorem|Every finite [[simple group]] is isomorphic to one of the following groups:
* a member of one of three infinite classes of such, namely:
** the [[cyclic groups]] of prime order,
** the [[alternating groups]] of degree at least 5,
** the [[groups of Lie type]]
* one of 26 groups called the "[[sporadic groups]]"
* the [[Tits group]] (which is sometimes considered a 27th sporadic group).}}

The classification theorem has applications in many branches of mathematics, as questions about the structure of [[finite group]]s (and their action on other mathematical objects) can sometimes be reduced to questions about finite simple groups. Thanks to the classification theorem, such questions can sometimes be answered by checking each family of simple groups and each sporadic group.

[[Daniel Gorenstein]] announced in 1983 that the finite simple groups had all been classified, but this was premature as he had been misinformed about the proof of the classification of [[quasithin group]]s. The completed proof of the classification was announced by {{harvtxt|Aschbacher|2004}} after Aschbacher and Smith published a 1221-page proof for the missing quasithin case.

==Overview of the proof of the classification theorem==
{{harvs|txt|last=Gorenstein|year1=1982|year2=1983}} wrote two volumes outlining the low rank and odd characteristic part of the proof, and {{harvs|txt| | last1=Aschbacher | first1=Michael | author1-link=Michael Aschbacher | last2=Lyons | first2=Richard | last3=Smith | first3=Stephen D. | last4=Solomon | first4=Ronald | title=The Classification of Finite Simple Groups: Groups of Characteristic 2 Type | url=http://www.ams.org/bookstore?fn=20&amp;ikey=SURV-172 | series=Mathematical Surveys and Monographs | isbn=978-0-8218-5336-8 | year=2011 | volume=172}}
wrote a 3rd volume covering the remaining characteristic 2 case. The proof can be broken up into several major pieces as follows:

===Groups of small 2-rank===
The simple groups of low [[rank of a group#Generalizations and related notions|2-rank]] are mostly groups of Lie type of small rank over fields of odd characteristic, together with five alternating and seven characteristic 2 type and nine sporadic groups.

The simple groups of small 2-rank include:
*Groups of 2-rank 0, in other words groups of odd order, which are all [[Solvable group|solvable]] by the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]].
*Groups of 2-rank 1. The Sylow 2-subgroups are either cyclic, which is easy to handle using the transfer map, or generalized [[quaternion]], which are handled with the [[Brauer–Suzuki theorem]]: in particular there are no simple groups of 2-rank 1.
*Groups of 2-rank 2. Alperin showed that the Sylow subgroup must be dihedral, quasidihedral, wreathed, or a Sylow 2-subgroup of ''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(4). The first case was done by the [[Gorenstein–Walter theorem]] which showed that the only simple groups are isomorphic to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') for ''q'' odd or ''A''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, the second and third cases were done by the [[Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem]] which implies that the only simple groups are isomorphic to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') or ''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') for ''q'' odd or ''M''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, and the last case was done by Lyons who showed that ''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(4) is the only simple possibility.
*Groups of sectional 2-rank at most 4, classified by the [[Gorenstein–Harada theorem]].
The classification of groups of small 2-rank, especially ranks at most 2, makes heavy use of ordinary and modular character theory, which is almost never directly used elsewhere in the classification.

All groups not of small 2 rank can be split into two major classes: groups of component type and groups of characteristic 2 type. This is because if a group has sectional 2-rank at least 5 then MacWilliams showed that its Sylow 2-subgroups are connected, and the [[balance theorem]] implies that any simple group with connected Sylow 2-subgroups is either of component type or characteristic 2 type. (For groups of low 2-rank the proof of this breaks down, because theorems such as the [[signalizer functor]] theorem only work for groups with elementary abelian subgroups of rank at least 3.)

===Groups of component type===
A group is said to be of component type if for some centralizer ''C'' of an involution, ''C''/''O''(''C'') has a component (where ''O''(''C'') is the core of ''C'', the maximal normal subgroup of odd order).
These are more or less the groups of Lie type of odd characteristic of large rank, and alternating groups, together with some sporadic groups.
A major step in this case is to eliminate the obstruction of the core of an involution. This is accomplished by the [[B-theorem]], which states that every component of ''C''/''O''(''C'') is the image of a component of ''C''.

The idea is that these groups have a centralizer of an involution with a component that is a smaller quasisimple group, which can be assumed to be already known by induction. So to classify these groups one takes every central extension of every known finite simple group, and finds all simple groups with a centralizer of involution with this as a component. This gives a rather large number of different cases to check: there are not only 26 sporadic groups and 16 families of groups of Lie type and the alternating groups, but also many of the groups of small rank or over small fields behave differently from the general case and have to be treated separately, and the groups of Lie type of even and odd characteristic are also quite different.

===Groups of characteristic 2 type===

A group is of characteristic 2 type if the [[generalized Fitting subgroup]] ''F''*(''Y'') of every 2-local subgroup ''Y'' is a 2-group.
As the name suggests these are roughly the groups of Lie type over fields of characteristic 2, plus a handful of others that are alternating or sporadic or of odd characteristic. Their classification is divided into the small and large rank cases, where the rank is the largest rank of an odd abelian subgroup normalizing a nontrivial 2-subgroup, which is often (but not always) the same as the rank of a Cartan subalgebra when the group is a group of Lie type in characteristic 2.

The rank 1 groups are the thin groups, classified by Aschbacher, and the rank 2 ones are the notorious [[quasithin group]]s, classified by Aschbacher and Smith. These correspond roughly to groups of Lie type of ranks 1 or 2 over fields of characteristic 2.

Groups of rank at least 3 are further subdivided into 3 classes by the [[trichotomy theorem]], proved by Aschbacher for rank 3 and by Gorenstein and Lyons for rank at least 4.
The three classes are groups of GF(2) type (classified mainly by Timmesfeld), groups of "standard type" for some odd prime (classified by the Gilman–Griess theorem and work by several others), and groups of uniqueness type, where a result of Aschbacher implies that there are no simple groups.
The general higher rank case consists mostly of the groups of Lie type over fields of characteristic 2 of rank at least 3 or 4.

===Existence and uniqueness of the simple groups===

The main part of the classification produces a characterization of each simple group. It is then necessary to check that there exists a simple group for each characterization and that it is unique. This gives a large number of separate problems; for example, the original proofs of existence and uniqueness of the [[monster group]] totaled about 200 pages, and the identification of the [[Ree groups]] by Thompson and Bombieri was one of the hardest parts of the classification. Many of the existence proofs and some of the uniqueness proofs for the sporadic groups originally used computer calculations, most of which have since been replaced by shorter hand proofs.

==History of the proof==

===Gorenstein's program===
In 1972 {{harvtxt|Gorenstein|1979|loc=Appendix}} announced a program for completing the classification of finite simple groups, consisting of the following 16 steps:
# Groups of low 2-rank. This was essentially done by Gorenstein and Harada, who classified the groups with sectional 2-rank at most 4. Most of the cases of 2-rank at most 2 had been done by the time Gorenstein announced his program.
# The semisimplicity of 2-layers. The problem is to prove that the 2-layer of the centralizer of an involution in a simple group is semisimple.
# Standard form in odd characteristic. If a group has an involution with a 2-component that is a group of Lie type of odd characteristic, the goal is to show that it has a centralizer of involution in "standard form" meaning that a centralizer of involution has a component that is of Lie type in odd characteristic and also has a centralizer of 2-rank 1.
# Classification of groups of odd type. The problem is to show that if a group has a centralizer of involution in "standard form" then it is a group of Lie type of odd characteristic. This was solved by Aschbacher's [[classical involution theorem]].
# Quasi-standard form
# Central involutions
# Classification of alternating groups.
# Some sporadic groups
# Thin groups. The simple [[thin finite groups]], those with 2-local ''p''-rank at most 1 for odd primes ''p'', were classified by Aschbacher in 1978
# Groups with a strongly p-embedded subgroup for ''p'' odd
# The signalizer functor method for odd primes. The main problem is to prove a [[signalizer functor]] theorem for nonsolvable signalizer functors. This was solved by McBride in 1982.
# Groups of characteristic ''p'' type. This is the problem of groups with a strongly ''p''-embedded 2-local subgroup with ''p'' odd, which was handled by Aschbacher.
# Quasithin groups. A [[quasithin group]] is one whose 2-local subgroups have ''p''-rank at most 2 for all odd primes ''p'', and the problem is to classify the simple ones of characteristic 2 type. This was completed by Aschbacher and Smith in 2004.
# Groups of low 2-local 3-rank. This was essentially solved by Aschbacher's [[trichotomy theorem]] for groups with ''e''(''G'')=3. The main change is that 2-local 3-rank is replaced by 2-local ''p''-rank for odd primes.
# Centralizers of 3-elements in standard form. This was essentially done by the [[Trichotomy theorem]].
# Classification of simple groups of characteristic 2 type. This was handled by the [[Gilman–Griess theorem]], with 3-elements replaced by ''p''-elements for odd primes.

==Second-generation classification==
The proof of the theorem, as it stood around 1985 or so, can be called ''first generation''. Because of the extreme length of the first generation proof, much effort has been devoted to finding a simpler proof, called a '''second-generation classification proof'''. This effort, called "revisionism", was originally led by [[Daniel Gorenstein]].

{{As of|2018}}, seven volumes of the second generation proof have been published {{harvs|last=Gorenstein|last2=Lyons|last3=Solomon|year1=1994|year2=1996|year3=1998|year4=1999|year5=2002|year6=2005|year7=2018}}. In 2012 Solomon estimated that the project would need another 5 volumes, but said that progress on them was slow. It is estimated that the new proof will eventually fill approximately 5,000 pages. (This length stems in part from second generation proof being written in a more relaxed style.) Aschbacher and Smith wrote their two volumes devoted to the quasithin case in such a way that those volumes can be part of the second generation proof.

Gorenstein and his collaborators have given several reasons why a simpler proof is possible.
* The most important is that the correct, final statement of the theorem is now known. Simpler techniques can be applied that are known to be adequate for the types of groups we know to be finite simple. In contrast, those who worked on the first generation proof did not know how many sporadic groups there were, and in fact some of the sporadic groups (e.g., the [[Janko group]]s) were discovered while proving other cases of the classification theorem. As a result, many of the pieces of the theorem were proved using techniques that were overly general.
*Because the conclusion was unknown, the first generation proof consists of many stand-alone theorems, dealing with important special cases. Much of the work of proving these theorems was devoted to the analysis of numerous special cases. Given a larger, orchestrated proof, dealing with many of these special cases can be postponed until the most powerful assumptions can be applied. The price paid under this revised strategy is that these first generation theorems no longer have comparatively short proofs, but instead rely on the complete classification.
*Many first generation theorems overlap, and so divide the possible cases in inefficient ways. As a result, families and subfamiles of finite simple groups were identified multiple times. The revised proof eliminates these redundancies by relying on a different subdivision of cases.
*Finite group theorists have more experience at this sort of exercise, and have new techniques at their disposal.

{{harvtxt|Aschbacher|2004}} has called the work on the classification problem by Ulrich Meierfrankenfeld, Bernd Stellmacher, Gernot Stroth, and a few others, a '''third generation program'''. One goal of this is to treat all groups in characteristic 2 uniformly using the amalgam method.

===Why is the proof so long?===

Gorenstein has discussed some of the reasons why there might not be a short proof of the classification similar to the classification of [[compact Lie group]]s.

*The most obvious reason is that the list of simple groups is quite complicated: with 26 sporadic groups there are likely to be many special cases that have to be considered in any proof. So far no one has yet found a clean uniform description of the finite simple groups similar to the parameterization of the compact Lie groups by [[Dynkin diagram]]s.
*Atiyah and others have suggested that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some geometric object that the groups act on and then classifying these geometric structures. The problem is that no one has been able to suggest an easy way to find such a geometric structure associated to a simple group. In some sense the classification does work by finding geometric structures such as [[BN-pair]]s, but this only comes at the end of a very long and difficult analysis of the structure of a finite simple group.
*Another suggestion for simplifying the proof is to make greater use of [[representation theory]]. The problem here is that representation theory seems to require very tight control over the subgroups of a group in order to work well. For groups of small rank one has such control and representation theory works very well, but for groups of larger rank no-one has succeeded in using it to simplify the classification. In the early days of the classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33639">In [[mathematics]], especially in [[algebraic geometry]] and the theory of [[complex manifold]]s, '''coherent sheaves''' are a class of [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] closely linked to the geometric properties of the underlying space. The definition of coherent sheaves is made with reference to a [[sheaf of rings]] that codifies this geometric information.

Coherent sheaves can be seen as a generalization of [[vector bundles]]. Unlike vector bundles, they form an [[abelian category]], and so they are closed under operations such as taking [[kernel (category theory)|kernels]], [[image (mathematics)|images]], and [[cokernel]]s. The  '''quasi-coherent sheaves''' are a generalization of coherent sheaves and include the locally free sheaves of infinite rank.

[[Coherent sheaf cohomology]] is a powerful technique, in particular for studying the sections of a given coherent sheaf.

== Definitions ==
A '''quasi-coherent sheaf''' on a [[ringed space]] (''X'',''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sheaf ''F'' of ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-[[sheaf of modules|modules]] which has a local presentation, that is, every point in ''X'' has an open neighborhood ''U'' in which there is an exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X^{\oplus I}|_{U} \to \mathcal{O}_X^{\oplus J}|_{U} \to \mathcal{F}|_{U} \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
for some sets ''I'' and ''J'' (possibly infinite).

A '''coherent sheaf''' on a [[ringed space]] (''X'',''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a quasi-coherent sheaf ''F'' satisfying the following two properties:
# ''F'' is of ''finite type'' over ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, every point in ''X'' has an [[open neighborhood]] ''U'' in ''X'' such that there is a surjective morphism ''O''{{sup sub| ''n'' | ''X''}}|&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''F''|&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; for some natural number ''n'';
# for any open set ''U'' ⊂ ''X'', any natural number ''n'', and any morphism φ: ''O''{{sup sub| ''n'' | ''X''}}|&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''F''|&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-modules, the kernel of φ is of finite type.

Morphisms between (quasi-)coherent sheaves are the same as morphisms of sheaves of ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-modules.

== The case of schemes ==

When ''X'' is a scheme, the general definitions above are equivalent to more explicit ones. A sheaf ''F'' of ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-modules is quasi-coherent if and only if over each open [[affine scheme|affine subscheme]] ''U''=Spec(''R'') the restriction ''F''|&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to a sheaf &lt;math&gt;\tilde{M}&lt;/math&gt; [[Sheaf associated to a module|associated]] to the module ''M''=''Γ(U, F)'' over ''R''. When ''X'' is a locally Noetherian scheme, ''F'' is '''coherent''' if and only if it is quasi-coherent and the modules ''M'' above can be taken to be [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]].

On an affine scheme ''U'' = Spec ''A'', there is an [[equivalence of categories]] from ''A''-modules to quasi-coherent sheaves, taking a module ''M'' to the associated sheaf {{overset|~|''M''}}. The inverse equivalence takes a quasi-coherent sheaf ''F'' on ''U'' to the ''A''-module ''F''(''U'') of global sections of ''F''.

Here are several further characterizations of quasi-coherent sheaves on a scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mumford|loc=Ch. III, § 1, Theorem-Definition 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{math_theorem|math_statement=Let ''X'' be a scheme and ''F'' an ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-module on it. Then the following are equivalent.
* ''F'' is quasi-coherent.
* For each open affine subscheme ''U'' of ''X'', ''F''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic as an ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;-module to the sheaf {{overset|~|''M''}} associated to some ''O''(''U'')-module ''M''.
* There is an open affine cover &lt;math&gt;\{U_\alpha \}&lt;/math&gt; of ''X'' such that for any ''U&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the cover ''F''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the sheaf associated to some ''O''(''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;)-module.
* For each pair of open affine subschemes ''V'' ⊂ ''U'' of ''X'', the natural homomorphism
*:&lt;math&gt;O(V) \otimes_{O(U)} F(U) \to F(V), \, f \otimes s \mapsto f\cdot s|_V&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism.
*For each open affine subscheme ''U'' = Spec ''A'' of ''X'' and each ''f'' in ''A'', writing {''f'' ≠ 0} for the open subscheme of ''U'' where ''f'' is not zero, the natural homomorphism
*:&lt;math&gt;F(U)\bigg[\frac{1}{f}\bigg] \to F(\{f\neq 0\})&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism. The homomorphism comes from the universal property of [[localization of a module|localization]].}}

== Properties ==
On an arbitrary ringed space quasi-coherent sheaves do not necessarily form an abelian category. On the other hand, the quasi-coherent sheaves on any [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] form an abelian category, and they are extremely useful in that context.&lt;ref name=St01LA&gt;{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 01LA | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01LA}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On any ringed space ''X'', the coherent sheaves form an abelian category, a [[full subcategory]] of the category of ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-modules.&lt;ref name=St01BU&gt;{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 01BU | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01BU}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Analogously, the category of [[coherent module]]s over any ring ''R'' is a full abelian subcategory of the category of all ''R''-modules.) So the kernel, image, and cokernel of any map of coherent sheaves are coherent. The [[direct sum]] of two coherent sheaves is coherent; more generally, an ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-module that is an [[extension of modules|extension]] of two coherent sheaves is coherent.&lt;ref&gt;Serre (1955), section 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

A submodule of a coherent sheaf is coherent if it is of finite type. A coherent sheaf is always an ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-module of ''finite presentation'', meaning that each point ''x'' in ''X'' has an open neighborhood ''U'' such that the restriction ''F''|&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''F'' to ''U'' is isomorphic to the cokernel of a morphism ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;|&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;|&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; for some natural numbers ''n'' and ''m''. If ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is coherent, then, conversely, every sheaf of finite presentation over ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is coherent.

The sheaf of rings ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is called coherent if it is coherent considered as a sheaf of modules over itself. In particular, the '''[[Oka coherence theorem]]''' states that the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a complex analytic space ''X'' is a coherent sheaf of rings. The main part of the proof is the case ''X'' = '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Likewise, on a [[Noetherian scheme|locally Noetherian scheme]] ''X'', the structure sheaf ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is a coherent sheaf of rings.&lt;ref&gt;Grothendieck, EGA I, Corollaire 1.5.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic constructions of coherent sheaves==
* An ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-module  ''F'' on a ringed space ''X'' is called '''locally free of finite rank''', or a '''[[vector bundle]]''', if every point in ''X'' has an open neighborhood ''U'' such that the restriction ''F''|&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;. If  ''F'' is free of the same rank ''n'' near every point of ''X'', then the vector bundle ''F'' is said to be of rank ''n''.
:Vector bundles in this sheaf-theoretic sense over a scheme ''X'' are equivalent to vector bundles defined in a more geometric way, as a scheme ''E'' with a morphism ''f'': ''E'' → ''X'' and with a covering of ''X'' by open sets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; with given isomorphisms ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;) ≅ ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; × ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; over ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; such that the two isomorphisms over an intersection ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''U''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; differ by a linear automorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Hartshorne (1977), Exercise II.5.18.&lt;/ref&gt; (The analogous equivalence also holds for complex analytic spaces.) For example, given a vector bundle ''E'' in this geometric sense, the corresponding sheaf is defined by: the group of sections ''E''(''U'') over an open set ''U'' in ''X'' is the set of [[section (fiber bundle)|section]]s of the morphism ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') → ''U''. The sheaf-theoretic interpretation of vector bundles has the advantage that vector bundles (on a locally Noetherian scheme) are included in the abelian category of coherent sheaves.

*Locally free sheaves come equipped with the standard &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;-module operations, but these give back locally free sheaves.{{vague|date=May 2018}}
&lt;!-- Some definitions are unclear like O(a), which need not be locallly free in general
*If we take the dual of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(a)&lt;/math&gt; for a projective scheme &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; this is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(-a)&lt;/math&gt;.
*Given locally free sheaves &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E},\mathcal{E}'&lt;/math&gt; there is the locally-free sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{E}')&lt;/math&gt; called the '''hom-sheaf''' defined by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{E}')(U) \cong \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X|_U}(\mathcal{E}|_U,\mathcal{E}'|_U)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}=\mathcal{E}'&lt;/math&gt;, then this sheaf of rings is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{End}(\mathcal{E})&lt;/math&gt;. In many case the hom-sheaf is readily computably: over a projective scheme &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{O}_X(a),\mathcal{O}_X(b))
 \cong \mathcal{O}_X(b-a)&lt;/math&gt;. Using this fact we can find that the endomorphism ring of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{O}_X(a)\oplus \mathcal{O}_X(b)&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as the matrix algebra
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{E}nd_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{E})(X)= \text{End}(\mathcal{E}) =\begin{bmatrix}
\Gamma(\mathcal{O}_X) &amp; \Gamma(\mathcal{O}_X(a-b)) \\
\Gamma(\mathcal{O}_X(b-a)) &amp; \Gamma(\mathcal{O}_X)
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
*We can also find that the tensor product of the line bundles &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{X}(a)\otimes\mathcal{O}_X(b) \cong \mathcal{O}_X(a+b)&lt;/math&gt;
*Using the fact that &lt;math&gt;\wedge^2 \mathcal{O}(a) \cong 0&lt;/math&gt; and the fact that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}\otimes \mathcal{E} \cong \text{Sym}^2(\mathcal{E})\oplus\wedge^2\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; we can see that
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\bigwedge^2 (\mathcal{O}_X(a)\oplus \mathcal{O}_X(b)) &amp;\cong \mathcal{O}_X(a+b) \\
\text{Sym}^2(\mathcal{O}_X(a)\oplus \mathcal{O}_X(b)) &amp;\cong \mathcal{O}_X(2a)\oplus \mathcal{O}_X(2b)

*Let ''X'' = Spec(''R''), ''R'' a Noetherian ring. Then vector bundles on ''X'' are exactly the sheaves associated to finitely generated [[projective module]]s over ''R'', or (equivalently) to finitely generated [[flat module]]s over ''R''.&lt;ref name=St00NV&gt;{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 00NV | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00NV}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Let ''X'' = Proj(''R''), ''R'' a Noetherian &lt;math&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt;-graded ring, be a [[projective scheme]] over a Noetherian ring ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Then each &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt;-graded ''R''-module ''M'' determines a quasi-coherent sheaf ''F'' on ''X'' such that &lt;math&gt;F|_{\{ f \ne 0 \}}&lt;/math&gt; is the sheaf associated to the &lt;math&gt;R[f^{-1}]_0&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M[f^{-1}]_0&lt;/math&gt;, where ''f'' is a homogeneous element of ''R'' of positive degree and &lt;math&gt;\{f \ne 0 \} = \operatorname{Spec} R[f^{-1}]_0&lt;/math&gt; is the locus where ''f'' doesn't vanish.

*For example, for each integer ''n'', let ''R''(''n'') denote the graded ''R''-module given by &lt;math&gt;R(n)_l =R_{n+l}&lt;/math&gt;. Then each &lt;math&gt;R(n)&lt;/math&gt; determines the quasi-coherent sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(n)&lt;/math&gt; on ''X''. If ''R'' is generated as ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-algebra by ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(n)&lt;/math&gt; are line bundles (invertible sheaves) on ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n''-th tensor power of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(1)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-1)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[tautological line bundle]] on the projective ''n''-space.

*A simple example of a coherent sheaf on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^2&lt;/math&gt; which is not a vector bundle is given by the cokernel in the following sequence
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(1) \xrightarrow{\cdot (x^2-yz,y^3 + xy^2 - xyz)} \mathcal{O}(3)\oplus \mathcal{O}(4) \to \mathcal{E} \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
:this is because &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; restricted to the vanishing locus of the two polynomials is the zero object.

* [[Ideal sheaf|Ideal sheaves]]: If ''Z'' is a closed subscheme of a locally Noetherian scheme ''X'', the sheaf ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''/''X''&lt;/sub&gt; of all regular functions vanishing on ''Z'' is coherent. Likewise, if ''Z'' is a closed analytic subspace of a complex analytic space ''X'', the ideal sheaf ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''/''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is coherent.

* The structure sheaf ''O&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a closed subscheme ''Z'' of a locally Noetherian scheme ''X'' can be viewed as a coherent sheaf on ''X''. To be precise, this is the [[direct image sheaf]] ''i''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''O&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''i'': ''Z'' → ''X'' is the inclusion. Likewise for a closed analytic subspace of a complex analytic space. The sheaf ''i''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''O''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; has fiber (defined below) of dimension zero at points in the open set ''X''−''Z'', and fiber of dimension 1 at points in ''Z''. There is a [[short exact sequence]] of coherent sheaves on ''X'':
::&lt;math&gt;0\to I_{Z/X} \to O_X \to i_*O_Z \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

*Most operations of [[linear algebra]] preserve coherent sheaves. In particular, for coherent sheaves ''F'' and ''G'' on a ringed space ''X'', the [[tensor product]] sheaf ''F''⊗ &lt;sub&gt;''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''G'' and the [[sheaf hom|sheaf of homomorphisms]] Hom&lt;sub&gt;''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'',''G'') are coherent.&lt;ref&gt;Serre (1955), section 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

*A simple '''non-example of a quasi-coherent sheaf''' is given by the extension by zero functor. For example, consider &lt;math&gt;i_!\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt; for
::&lt;math&gt;X = \text{Spec}(\C[x,x^{-1}]) \xrightarrow{i} \text{Spec}(\C[x])=Y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Algebraic Geometry|last=Hartshorne|first=Robin|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Since this sheaf has non-trivial stalks, but zero global sections, this cannot be a quasi-coherent sheaf. This is because quasi-coherent sheaves on an affine scheme are equivalent to the category of modules over the underlying ring, and the adjunction comes from taking global sections.

==Functoriality==
Let ƒ: ''X'' → ''Y'' be a morphism of ringed spaces (for example, a [[morphism of schemes]]). If ''F'' is a quasi-coherent sheaf on ''Y'', then the [[inverse image sheaf|inverse image]] ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-module (or '''pullback''') ''f''*''F'' is quasi-coherent on ''X''.&lt;ref name=St01BG&gt;{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 01BG | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01BG}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For a morphism of schemes ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' and a coherent sheaf ''F'' on ''Y'', the pullback ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''F'' is not coherent in full generality (for example, ''f''*''O''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, which might not be coherent), but pullbacks of coherent sheaves are coherent if ''X'' is locally Noetherian. An important special case is the pullback of a vector bundle, which is a vector bundle.

If ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' is a [[quasi-compact]] [[Glossary of scheme theory#Separated and proper morphisms|quasi-separated]] morphism of schemes and ''E'' is a quasi-coherent sheaf on ''X'', then the direct image sheaf (or '''pushforward''') ''f''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''E'' is quasi-coherent on ''Y''.&lt;ref name=St01LA/&gt;

The direct image of a coherent sheaf is often not coherent. For example, for a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'', let ''X'' be the affine line over ''k'', and consider the morphism ''f'': ''X'' → Spec(''k''); then the direct image ''f''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sheaf on Spec(''k'') associated to the polynomial ring ''k''[''x''], which is not coherent because ''k''[''x''] has infinite dimension as a ''k''-vector space. On the other hand, the direct image of a coherent sheaf under a [[proper morphism]] is coherent, by [[Coherent sheaf cohomology#Finite-dimensionality of cohomology|results of Grauert and Grothendieck]].

==Local behavior of coherent sheaves==
An important feature of coherent sheaves ''F'' is that the properties of ''F'' at a point ''p'' control the behavior of ''F'' in a neighborhood of ''p'', more than would be true for an arbitrary sheaf. For example, [[Nakayama's lemma]] says (in geometric language) that if ''F'' is a coherent sheaf on a scheme ''X'', then the '''fiber''' ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;⊗&lt;sub&gt;''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X'',''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''k''(''p'') of ''F'' at a point ''p'' (a vector space over the residue field ''k''(''p'')) is zero if and only if the sheaf ''F'' is zero on some open neighborhood of ''p''. A related fact is that the dimension of the fibers of a coherent sheaf is [[Semi-continuity|upper-semicontinuous]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartshorne (1977), Example III.12.7.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a coherent sheaf has constant rank on an open set, while the rank can jump up on a lower-dimensional closed subset.

In the same spirit: a coherent sheaf ''F'' on a scheme ''X'' is a vector bundle if and only if its [[Stalk of a sheaf|stalk]] ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[free module|free]] module over the local ring ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X'',''p''&lt;/sub&gt; for every point ''p'' in ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;Grothendieck, EGA I, Ch. 0, 5.2.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a general scheme, one cannot determine whether a coherent sheaf is a vector bundle just from its fibers (as opposed to its stalks). On a [[reduced scheme|reduced]] locally Noetherian scheme, however, a coherent sheaf is a vector bundle if and only if its rank is locally constant.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenbud (1995), Exercise 20.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of vector bundles==
For a morphism of schemes ''X'' → ''Y'', let Δ: ''X'' → ''X'' ×&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; ''X'' be the [[diagonal morphism]], which is a [[closed immersion]] if ''X'' is [[separated scheme|separated]] over ''Y''. Let ''I'' be the ideal sheaf of ''X'' in ''X'' ×&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; ''X''. Then the sheaf of '''[[Kähler differential|differentials]]''' Ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined as the pullback Δ*(''I'') of ''I'' to ''X''. Sections of this sheaf are called [[differential form|1-forms]] on ''X'' over ''Y'', and they can be written locally on ''X'' as finite sums ∑ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; d''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for regular functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. If ''X'' is locally of finite type over a field ''k'', then Ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a coherent sheaf on ''X''.

If ''X'' is [[smooth scheme|smooth]] over ''k'', then Ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (meaning Ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a vector bundle over ''X'', called the '''[[cotangent bundle]]''' of ''X''. Then the '''[[tangent bundle]]''' ''TX'' is defined to be the dual bundle (Ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)*. For ''X'' smooth over ''k'' of dimension ''n'' everywhere, the tangent bundle has rank ''n''.

If ''Y'' is a smooth closed subscheme of a smooth scheme ''X'' over ''k'', then there is a short exact sequence of vector bundles on ''Y'':
:&lt;math&gt;0\to TY \to TX|_Y \to N_{Y/X}\to 0,&lt;/math&gt;
which can be used as a definition of the '''[[normal bundle]]''' ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''/''X''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Y'' in ''X''.

For a smooth scheme ''X'' over a field ''k'' and a natural number ''a'', the vector bundle Ω&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; of [[differential form|''a''-forms]] on ''X'' is defined as the ''a''th [[exterior power]] of the cotangent bundle, Ω&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; = Λ&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;Ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. For a smooth [[algebraic variety|variety]] ''X'' of dimension ''n'' over ''k'', the '''[[canonical bundle]]''' ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; means the line bundle Ω&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus sections of the canonical bundle are algebro-geometric analogs of [[volume form]]s on ''X''. For example, a section of the canonical bundle of affine space ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; over ''k''
can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \; dx_1 \wedge\cdots\wedge dx_n,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''f'' is a polynomial with coefficients in ''k''.

Let ''R'' be a commutative ring and ''n'' a natural number. For each integer ''j'', there is an important example of a line bundle on projective space '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; over ''R'', called ''O''(''j''). To define this, consider the morphism of ''R''-schemes
:&lt;math&gt;\pi\colon A^{n+1}-0\to \mathbf{P}^n&lt;/math&gt;
given in coordinates by (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ↦ [''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]. (That is, thinking of projective space as the space of 1-dimensional linear subspaces of affine space, send a nonzero point in affine space to the line that it spans.) Then a section of ''O''(''j'') over an open subset ''U'' of '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is defined to be a regular function ''f'' on π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') that is homogeneous of degree ''j'', meaning that
:&lt;math&gt;f(ax)=a^jf(x)&lt;/math&gt;
as regular functions on (''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; − 0) × π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U''). For all integers ''i'' and ''j'', there is an isomorphism ''O''(''i'') ⊗ ''O''(''j'') ≅ ''O''(''i''+''j'') of line bundles on '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

In particular, every [[homogeneous polynomial]] in ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of degree ''j'' over ''R'' can be viewed as a global section of ''O''(''j'') over '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Note that every closed subscheme of projective space can be defined as the zero set of some collection of homogeneous polynomials, hence as the zero set of some sections of the line bundles ''O''(''j'').&lt;ref&gt;Hartshorne (1977), Corollary II.5.16.&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the simpler case of affine space, where a closed subscheme is simply the zero set of some collection of regular functions. The regular functions on projective space '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; over ''R'' are just the "constants" (the ring ''R''), and so it is essential to work with the line bundles ''O''(''j'').

[[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] gave an algebraic description of all coherent sheaves on projective space, more subtle than what happens for affine space. Namely, let ''R'' be a Noetherian ring (for example, a field), and consider the polynomial ring ''S'' = ''R''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] as a [[graded ring]] with each ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; having degree 1. Then every finitely generated graded ''S''-module ''M'' has an [[Proj construction#The sheaf associated to a graded module|associated]] coherent sheaf {{overset|~|''M''}} on '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; over ''R''. Every coherent sheaf on '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; arises in this way from a finitely generated graded ''S''-module ''M''. (For example, the line bundle ''O''(''j'') is the sheaf associated to the ''S''-module ''S'' with its grading lowered by ''j''.) But the ''S''-module ''M'' that yields a given coherent sheaf on '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is not unique; it is only unique up to changing ''M'' by graded modules that are nonzero in only finitely many degrees. More precisely, the abelian category of coherent sheaves on '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[quotient of an abelian category|quotient]] of the category of finitely generated graded ''S''-modules by the [[Serre subcategory]] of modules that are nonzero in only finitely many degrees.&lt;ref name=St01YR&gt;{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 01YR | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01YR}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tangent bundle of projective space '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; over a field ''k'' can be described in terms of the line bundle ''O''(1). Namely, there is a short exact sequence, the [[Euler sequence]]:
:&lt;math&gt; 0\to O_{\mathbf{P}^n}\to O(1)^{\oplus \; n+1}\to T\mathbf{P}^n\to 0.&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that the canonical bundle ''K''&lt;sub&gt;'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (the dual of the [[determinant line bundle]] of the tangent bundle) is isomorphic to ''O''(−''n''−1). This is a fundamental calculation for algebraic geometry. For example, the fact that the canonical bundle is a negative multiple of the [[ample line bundle]] ''O''(1) means that projective space is a [[Fano variety]]. Over the complex numbers, this means that projective space has a [[Kähler metric]] with positive [[Ricci curvature]].

=== Vector bundles on a hypersurface ===
Consider a smooth degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; hypersurface &lt;math&gt;X \subset \mathbb{P}^n&lt;/math&gt; defined by the homogeneous polynomial &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there is an exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \mathcal{O}_X(-d) \to i^*\Omega_{\mathbb{P}^n} \to \Omega_X \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;
where the second map is the pullback of differential forms, and the first map sends
:&lt;math&gt; \phi \mapsto d(f\cdot \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that this sequence tells us that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(-d)&lt;/math&gt; is the conormal sheaf of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Dualizing this yields the exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt; 0 \to T_X \to i^*T_{\mathbb{P}^n} \to \mathcal{O}(d) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
hence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(d)&lt;/math&gt; is the normal bundle of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^n&lt;/math&gt;. If we use the fact that given an exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \mathcal{E}_1 \to \mathcal{E}_2 \to \mathcal{E}_3 \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
of ranks &lt;math&gt;e_1,e_2,e_3,&lt;/math&gt;, there is an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{e_2}\mathcal{E}_2 \cong \Lambda^{e_1}\mathcal{E}_1\otimes \Lambda^{e_2}\mathcal{E}_2&lt;/math&gt;
of line bundles, then we see that there is the isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;i^*\omega_{\mathbb{P}^n} \cong \omega_X\otimes \mathcal{O}_X(-d)&lt;/math&gt;
showing that
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_X \cong \mathcal{O}_X(d - n -1)&lt;/math&gt;

==Chern classes and algebraic ''K''-theory==
A vector bundle ''E'' on a smooth variety ''X'' over a field has [[Chern class]]es in the [[Chow ring]] of ''X'', ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''E'') in CH&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') for ''i'' ≥ 0.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton (1998), section 3.2 and Example 8.3.3.&lt;/ref&gt; These satisfy the same formal properties as Chern classes in topology. For example, for any short exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;0\to A \to B \to C \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
of vector bundles on ''X'', the Chern classes of ''B'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt;c_i(B) = c_i(A)+c_1(A)c_{i-1}(C)+\cdots+c_{i-1}(A)c_1(C)+c_i(C).&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that the Chern classes of a vector bundle ''E'' depend only on the class of ''E'' in the [[Grothendieck group]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). By definition, for a scheme ''X'', ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is the quotient of the free abelian group on the set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles on ''X'' by the relation that [B] = [A] + [C] for any short exact sequence as above. Although ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is hard to compute in general, [[algebraic K-theory]] provides many tools for studying it, including a sequence of related groups ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') for integers ''i''.

A variant is the group ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') (or ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'(''X'')), the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on ''X''. (In topological terms, ''G''-theory has the formal properties of a [[Borel–Moore homology]] theory for schemes, while ''K''-theory is the corresponding [[cohomology theory]].) The natural homomorphism ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') → ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is an isomorphism if ''X'' is a [[regular scheme|regular]] separated Noetherian scheme, using that every coherent sheaf has a finite [[resolution (algebra)|resolution]] by vector bundles in that case.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton (1998), B.8.3.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, that gives a definition of the Chern classes of a coherent sheaf on a smooth variety over a field.

More generally, a Noetherian scheme ''X'' is said to have the '''resolution property''' if every coherent sheaf on ''X'' has a surjection from some vector bundle on ''X''. For example, every quasi-projective scheme over a Noetherian ring has the resolution property.

== Bundle homomorphism v.s. sheaf homorphism ==
When vector bundles and locally free sheaves of finite constant rank are used interchangeably,
care must be given to distinguish between bundle homorphisms and sheaf homorphisms. Specifically, given vector bundles &lt;math&gt;p: E \to X, \, q: F \to X&lt;/math&gt;, by definition, a bundle homorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi: E \to F&lt;/math&gt; is a [[scheme morphism]] over ''X'' (i.e., &lt;math&gt;p = q \circ \varphi&lt;/math&gt;) such that, for each geometric point ''x'' in ''X'', &lt;math&gt;\varphi: p^{-1}(x) \to q^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear map of rank independent of ''x''. Thus, it induces the sheaf homorphism &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\varphi}: \widetilde{E} \to \widetilde{F}&lt;/math&gt; of constant rank between the corresponding locally free &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;-modules (sheaves of dual sections). But there may be an &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;-module homorphism that does not arise this way; namely, those not having constant rank.

In particular, a subbundle &lt;math&gt;E \subset F&lt;/math&gt; is a subsheaf (&lt;math&gt;E, F&lt;/math&gt; viewed as sheaves). But the converse can fail; for example, for an effective Cartier divisor ''D'' on ''X'', &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(-D) \subset \mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt; is a subsheaf but typically not a subbundle (since any line bundle has only two subbundles).

==The category of quasi-coherent sheaves==
Quasi-coherent sheaves on any scheme form an abelian category. [[Ofer Gabber|Gabber]] showed that, in fact, the quasi-coherent sheaves on any scheme form a particularly well-behaved abelian category, a [[Grothendieck category]].&lt;ref name=St077K&gt;{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 077K | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/077K}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme ''X'' (such as an algebraic variety over a field) is determined up to isomorphism by the abelian category of quasi-coherent sheaves on ''X'', by Rosenberg, generalizing a result of [[Pierre Gabriel|Gabriel]].&lt;ref&gt;Antieau (2016), Corollary 4.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coherent cohomology==
{{main|Coherent sheaf cohomology}}
The fundamental technical tool in algebraic geometry is the cohomology theory of coherent sheaves. Although it was introduced only in the 1950s, many earlier techniques of algebraic geometry are clarified by the language of [[sheaf cohomology]] applied to coherent sheaves. Broadly speaking, coherent sheaf cohomology can be viewed as a tool for producing functions with specified properties; sections of line bundles or of more general sheaves can be viewed as generalized functions. In complex analytic geometry, coherent sheaf cohomology also plays a foundational role.

Among the core results of coherent sheaf cohomology are results on finite-dimensionality of cohomology, results on the vanishing of cohomology in various cases, duality theorems such as [[Serre duality]], relations between topology and algebraic geometry such as [[Hodge theory]], and formulas for [[Euler characteristic]]s of coherent sheaves such as the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="935">A '''comma code''' is a type of [[prefix-free code]] in which a '''comma''', a particular symbol or sequence of symbols, occurs at the end of a code word and never occurs otherwise.&lt;ref name="Wade1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wade |first=Graham |title=Signal Coding and Processing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJswCy7_W8YC&amp;pg=PA56 |date=8 September 1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42336-6 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Fibonacci coding]] is a comma code in which the comma is &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1011&lt;/code&gt; are valid Fibonacci code words, but &lt;code&gt;101&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0111&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;11011&lt;/code&gt; are not.

== Examples ==

* [[Unary coding]], in which the comma is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.
* [[Fibonacci coding]], in which the comma is &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], a '''dependence relation''' is a [[binary relation]] which generalizes the relation of [[linear dependence]].

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[set (mathematics)|set]]. A (binary) relation &lt;math&gt;\triangleleft&lt;/math&gt; between an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a [[subset]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''dependence relation'', written &lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft S&lt;/math&gt;, if it satisfies the following properties: 
* if &lt;math&gt;a \in S&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft S&lt;/math&gt;;
* if &lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft S&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a [[finite set|finite]] subset &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, such that  &lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft S_0&lt;/math&gt;;
* if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;b \in S&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;b \triangleleft T&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft S&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft T&lt;/math&gt;;
* if &lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft S&lt;/math&gt; but  &lt;math&gt;a \not\!\triangleleft S-\lbrace b \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;b \in S&lt;/math&gt;, then  &lt;math&gt;b \triangleleft (S-\lbrace b \rbrace)\cup\lbrace a \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a ''dependence relation'' &lt;math&gt;\triangleleft&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''independent'' if  &lt;math&gt;a \not\!\triangleleft S - \lbrace a \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a \in S.&lt;/math&gt; If  &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''span'' &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;t \triangleleft S&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;t \in T.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a ''basis'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is ''independent'' and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; ''spans'' &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt; 

'''Remark.''' If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty set with a dependence relation &lt;math&gt;\triangleleft&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; always has a basis with respect to &lt;math&gt;\triangleleft.&lt;/math&gt; Furthermore, any two bases of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; have the same [[cardinality]]. 

==Examples==
* Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a [[vector space]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;F.&lt;/math&gt; The relation &lt;math&gt;\triangleleft&lt;/math&gt;, defined by  &lt;math&gt;\upsilon \triangleleft S&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\upsilon&lt;/math&gt; is in the [[linear subspace|subspace]] spanned by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, is a dependence relation. This is [[logical equivalence|equivalent]] to the definition of [[linear independence|linear dependence]].
* Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a [[field extension]] of &lt;math&gt;F.&lt;/math&gt; Define &lt;math&gt;\triangleleft&lt;/math&gt; by  &lt;math&gt;\alpha \triangleleft S&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is [[algebraic element|algebraic]] over &lt;math&gt;F(S).&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;\triangleleft&lt;/math&gt; is a dependence relation. This is equivalent to the definition of [[algebraic dependence]].

In [[geometry]], a '''face diagonal''' of a [[polyhedron]] is a [[diagonal]] on one of the [[faces (geometry)|faces]], in contrast to a [[space diagonal]] passing through the interior of the polyhedron.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mathematics: From the Birth of Numbers|first=Jan|last=Gullberg|publisher=W.

A [[cuboid]] has twelve face diagonals (two on each of the six faces), and it has four space diagonals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=New Maths in Action|first=Edward C. K.|last=Mullan|publisher=Nelson Thornes|year=2003|isbn=9780748765195|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roPoNOacwPkC&amp;pg=PA220}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cuboid's face diagonals can have up to three different lengths, since the faces come in congruent pairs and the two diagonals on any face are equal. The cuboid's space diagonals all have the same length.  If the edge lengths of a cuboid are ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', then the distinct rectangular faces have edges (''a'', ''b''), (''a'', ''c''), and (''b'', ''c''); so the respective face diagonals have lengths &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+c^2},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{b^2+c^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus each face diagonal of a [[cube]] with side length ''a'' is &lt;math&gt;a\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Essence of Materials for Engineers|first=Robert W., Jr.|last=Messler|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|year=2010|isbn=9780763778330|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VN9BTDdOLYcC&amp;pg=PA56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--{{redirect text|Euclidean subspace|It may erroneously refer to a [[linear subspace]] in the [[real n-space]]}} not redirected yet, but I hope it will come soon --&gt;

In [[geometry]], a '''flat''' is a subset of a [[Euclidean space]] that is [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to a Euclidean space of lower [[dimension]].  The flats in two-dimensional space are [[point (mathematics)|points]] and [[line (mathematics)|lines]], and the flats in [[three-dimensional space]] are points, lines, and [[plane (mathematics)|planes]].

In a [[n-dimensional space|{{mvar|n}}-dimensional space]], there are flats of every dimension from 0 to {{math|''n'' − 1}}.&lt;ref&gt;In addition, a whole {{mvar|n}}-dimensional space, being a subset of itself, may also be considered as an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional flat.&lt;/ref&gt; Flats of dimension {{math|''n'' − 1}} are called [[hyperplane]]s.

Flats are the [[affine subspace]]s of Euclidean spaces, which means that they are similar to [[linear subspace]]s, except that they need not pass through the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Flats occurs in [[linear algebra]], as geometric realizations of solution sets of [[systems of linear equations]].

A flat is [[manifold]] and an [[algebraic variety]], and is sometimes called ''linear manifold'' or ''linear variety'' for distinguishing it from other manifolds or varieties.

==Descriptions==

===By equations===
A flat can be described by a [[system of linear equations]].  For example, a line in two-dimensional space can be described by a single linear equation involving {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}:
:&lt;math&gt;3x + 5y = 8.&lt;/math&gt;
In three-dimensional space, a single linear equation involving {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} defines a plane, while a pair of linear equations can be used to describe a line.  In general, a linear equation in {{mvar|n}} variables describes a hyperplane, and a system of linear equations describes the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of those hyperplanes.  Assuming the equations are consistent and [[linearly independent]], a system of {{mvar|k}} equations describes a flat of dimension {{math|''n'' − ''k''}}.

===Parametric===
A flat can also be described by a system of linear [[parametric equation]]s.  A line can be described by equations involving one [[parameter]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x=2+3t,\;\;\;\;y=-1+t\;\;\;\;z=\frac{3}{2}-4t&lt;/math&gt;

while the description of a plane would require two parameters:

:&lt;math&gt;x=5+2t_1-3t_2,\;\;\;\; y=-4+t_1+2t_2\;\;\;\;z=5t_1-3t_2.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In general, a parameterization of a flat of dimension {{mvar|k}} would require parameters {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

==Operations and relations on flats==

===Intersecting, parallel, and skew flats===
An [[set intersection|intersection]] of flats is either a flat or the [[empty set]].&lt;ref&gt;Can be considered as {{num|−1}}-flat.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- only for equal dimensions? --&gt;If every line from the first flat is parallel to some line from the second flat, then these flats are [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]]. Two parallel flats of the same dimension either coincide or do not intersect; they can be described by two systems of linear equations which differ only in their right-hand sides.

If flats do not intersect, and no line from the first flat is parallel to a line from the second flat, then these are [[skew flats]]. It is possible only if sum of their dimensions is less than dimension of the ambient space.

===Join&lt;!-- is it a correct name? --&gt;===
For two flats of dimensions {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} there exists the minimal flat which contains them, of dimension at most {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1}}. If two flats intersect, then the dimension of the containing flat equals to {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} minus the dimension of the intersection.

===Properties of operations===
These two operations (referred to as ''meet'' and ''join'') make the set of all flats in the Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] and can build systematic coordinates for flats in any dimension, leading to [[Plücker coordinates|Grassmann coordinates]] or dual Grassmann coordinates. For example, a line in three-dimensional space is determined by two distinct points or by two distinct planes.

However, the lattice of all flats is not a [[distributive lattice]].
&lt;!-- an image needed --&gt;If two lines {{math|ℓ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|ℓ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} intersect, then {{math|ℓ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ℓ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a point. If {{mvar|p}} is a point not lying on the same plane, then {{math|1=(ℓ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ℓ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''p'' = (ℓ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p'') ∩ (ℓ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p'')}}, both representing a line. But when {{math|ℓ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|ℓ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are parallel, this [[distributive property|distributivity]] fails, giving {{mvar|p}} on the left-hand side and a third parallel line on the right-hand side.

==Euclidean geometry==
The aforementioned facts do not depend on the structure being that of Euclidean space (namely, involving  [[Euclidean distance]]) and are correct in any [[affine space]]. In a Euclidean space:
* There is the distance between a flat and a point. (See for example [[Distance from a point to a plane]] and [[Distance from a point to a line]].)
&lt;!-- write formulae --&gt;
* There is the distance between two flats, equal to 0 if they intersect. (See for example [[Distance between two lines]] (in the same plane) and [[Skew lines#Distance]].)
&lt;!-- write formulae --&gt;
* There is the [[angle]] between two flats, which belongs to the interval {{closed-closed|0, &amp;pi;/2}} between 0 and the [[right angle]]. (See for example [[Dihedral angle]] (between two planes). See also [[Angles between flats]].)
&lt;!-- the definition is tricky because it depends on dimension of the ambient space --&gt;
&lt;!-- once principal angles are defined ([[Angles between flats]]), the single angle is acos(prod(cos theta_i)). See http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00148212 --&gt;

==Statement of the theorem==
Let '''N''' be the set {1, 2, 3, ...} of positive integers, and suppose that '''N''' is partitioned into ''k'' different subsets ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''k'' is any positive integer. Then Folkman's theorem states that, for every positive integer ''m'', there exists a set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and an index ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; has ''m'' elements and such that every sum of a nonempty subset of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; belongs to ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="grs"/&gt;

==Relation to Rado's theorem and Schur's theorem==
[[Schur's theorem]] in Ramsey theory states that, for any finite partition of the positive integers, there exist three numbers ''x'', ''y'', and ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'' that all belong to the same partition set. That is, it is the special case ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 of Folkman's theorem.

[[Rado's theorem (Ramsey theory)|Rado's theorem]] in Ramsey theory concerns a similar problem statement in which the integers are partitioned into finitely many subsets; the theorem characterizes the integer matrices '''A''' with the property that the [[system of linear equations]] {{nowrap|1='''A''' ''x'' = 0}} can be guaranteed to have a solution in which every coordinate of the solution vector ''x'' belongs to the same subset of the partition. A system of equations is said to be ''regular'' whenever it satisfies the conditions of Rado's theorem; Folkman's theorem is equivalent to the regularity of the system of equations
:&lt;math&gt;x_T = \sum_{i\in T}x_{\{i\}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T'' ranges over each nonempty subset of the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, ..., ''m''}.}}&lt;ref name="grs"/&gt;

==Multiplication versus addition==
It is possible to replace addition by multiplication in Folkman's theorem: if the natural numbers are finitely partitioned, there exist arbitrarily large sets ''S'' such that all products of nonempty subsets of ''S'' belong to a single partition set. Indeed, if one restricts ''S'' to consist only of [[power of two|powers of two]], then this result follows immediately from the additive version of Folkman's theorem. However, it is open whether there exist arbitrarily large sets such that all sums and all products of nonempty subsets belong to a single partition set. It is not even known whether there must necessarily exist a set of the form {{nowrap|{''x'', ''y'', ''x'' + ''y'', ''xy''}}} for which all four elements belong to the same partition set.&lt;ref name="grs"/&gt;

==Canonical Folkman Theorem==
Let &lt;math&gt;FS(\{x_i\}_{i = 1}^n)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all finite sums of elements of &lt;math&gt;\{x_i\}_{i = 1}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a (possibly infinite) coloring of the positive integers, and let &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary positive integer. There exists &lt;math&gt;\{x_i\}_{i = 1}^n&lt;/math&gt; such that at least one of the following 3 conditions holds.

1) &lt;math&gt;FS(\{x_i\}_{i = 1}^n)&lt;/math&gt; is a monochromatic set.

2) &lt;math&gt;FS(\{x_i\}_{i = 1}^n)&lt;/math&gt; is a rainbow set.

3) For any &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq [1,n]&lt;/math&gt;, the color of &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in B}x_i&lt;/math&gt; is determined solely by &lt;math&gt;\min(B)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Previous results==
Variants of Folkman's theorem had been proved by [[Richard&amp;nbsp;Rado]] and by J.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;Sanders.&lt;ref name="Rado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" grs"/&gt;  Folkman's theorem was named in memory of [[Jon Folkman]]  by [[Ronald Graham]], [[Bruce Lee Rothschild]], and [[Joel Spencer]], in their book on [[Ramsey&amp;nbsp;theory]].&lt;ref name="grs"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2754">In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''fundamental theorem of [[linear programming]]''' states, in a weak formulation, that the [[maxima and minima]] of a [[linear function]] over a [[convex polygon]]al region occur at the region's corners. Further, if an extreme value occurs at two corners, then it must also occur everywhere on the [[line segment]] between them.

==Statement==
Consider the optimization problem 

:&lt;math&gt;\min c^T x \text{ subject to } x \in P&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;P = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : Ax \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded polyhedron (and thus a polytope) and &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is an optimal solution to the problem, then &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is either an extreme point (vertex) of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, or lies on a face &lt;math&gt;F \subset P&lt;/math&gt; of optimal solutions.

==Proof==
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that &lt;math&gt;x^\ast \in \mathrm{int}(P)&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists some &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that the ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; centered at &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;B_{\epsilon}(x^\ast) \subset P&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{c}{||c||} \in P&lt;/math&gt; and 

:&lt;math&gt;c^T\left( x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{c}{||c||}\right) = c^T x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{c^T c}{||c||} = c^T x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} ||c|| &lt; c^T x^\ast.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is not an optimal solution, a contradiction. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; must live on the boundary of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is not a vertex itself, it must be the convex combination of vertices of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, say &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_t&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;x^\ast = \sum_{i=1}^t \lambda_i x_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^t \lambda_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Observe that 

:&lt;math&gt;0=c^{T}\left(\left(\sum_{i=1}^{t}\lambda_{i}x_{i}\right)-x^{\ast}\right)=c^{T}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{t}\lambda_{i}(x_{i}-x^{\ast})\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{t}\lambda_{i}(c^{T}x_{i}-c^{T}x^{\ast}).&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt; is an optimal solution, all terms in the sum are nonnegative. Since the sum is equal to zero, we must have that each individual term is equal to zero.  Hence, &lt;math&gt;c^{T}x^{\ast}=c^{T}x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, so every &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is also optimal, and therefore all points on the face whose vertices are &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_t&lt;/math&gt;, are optimal solutions.

:''For a closed immersion in algebraic geometry, see [[closed immersion]].''
In [[mathematics]], an '''immersion''' is a [[differentiable function]] between [[differentiable manifold]]s whose [[Pushforward (differential)|derivative]] is everywhere [[injective]].&lt;ref&gt;This definition is given by {{harvnb|Bishop|Crittenden|1964|page=185}}, {{harvnb|Darling|1994|page=53}}, {{harvnb|do Carmo|1994|page=11}}, {{harvnb|Frankel|1997|page=169}}, {{harvnb|Gallot|Hulin|Lafontaine|2004|page=12}}, {{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1963|page=9}}, {{harvnb|Kosinski|2007|page=27}}, {{harvnb|Szekeres|2004|page=429}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly, {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is an immersion if

:&lt;math&gt;D_pf : T_p M \to T_{f(p)}N\,&lt;/math&gt;

is an injective function at every point ''p'' of ''M'' (where ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;X'' denotes the [[tangent space]] of a manifold ''X'' at a point ''p'' in ''X''). Equivalently, ''f'' is an immersion if its derivative has constant [[rank (differential topology)|rank]] equal to the dimension of ''M'':&lt;ref&gt;This definition is given by {{harvnb|Crampin|Pirani|1994|page=243}}, {{harvnb|Spivak|1999|page=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}\,D_p f = \dim M.&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''f'' itself need not be injective, only its derivative.

A related concept is that of an [[Embedding#Differential topology|embedding]]. A smooth embedding is an injective immersion {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} that is also a [[topological embedding]], so that ''M'' is [[diffeomorphic]] to its image in ''N''.  An immersion is precisely a local embedding – i.e., for any point {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''M''}} there is a [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]], {{nowrap|''U'' ⊂ ''M''}}, of ''x''  such that {{nowrap|''f'' : ''U'' → ''N''}} is an embedding, and conversely a local embedding is an immersion.&lt;ref&gt;This kind of definition, based on local diffeomorphisms, is given by {{harvnb|Bishop|Goldberg|1968|page=40}}, {{harvnb|Lang|1999|page=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For infinite dimensional manifolds, this is sometimes taken to be the definition of an immersion.&lt;ref&gt;This kind of infinite-dimensional definition is given by {{harvnb|Lang|1999|page=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Injectively_immersed_submanifold_not_embedding.svg|thumb|border|frame|An injectively [[immersed submanifold]] that is not an embedding.]]
If ''M'' is [[Compact space|compact]], an injective immersion is an embedding, but if ''M'' is not compact then injective immersions need not be embeddings; compare to continuous bijections versus [[homeomorphism]]s.

==Regular homotopy==
A [[regular homotopy]] between two immersions ''f'' and ''g'' from a [[manifold]] ''M'' to a manifold ''N'' is defined to be a differentiable function {{nowrap|''H'' : ''M'' × [0,1] → ''N''}} such that for all ''t'' in {{nowrap|[0, 1]}} the function {{nowrap|''H&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''H&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = ''H''(''x'', ''t'')}} for all {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''M''}} is an immersion, with {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''}}, {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''}}. A regular homotopy is thus a [[homotopy]] through immersions.

== Classification ==
[[Hassler Whitney]] initiated the systematic study of immersions and regular homotopies in the 1940s, proving that for {{nowrap|1=2''m'' &lt; ''n'' + 1}} every map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' → ''N&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} of an ''m''-dimensional manifold to an ''n''-dimensional manifold is [[homotopic]] to an immersion, and in fact to an [[embedding]] for {{nowrap|2''m'' &lt; ''n''}}; these are the [[Whitney immersion theorem]] and [[Whitney embedding theorem]].

[[Stephen Smale]] expressed the regular homotopy classes of immersions {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as the [[homotopy groups]] of a certain [[Stiefel manifold]]. The [[sphere eversion]] was a particularly striking consequence.

[[Morris Hirsch]] generalized Smale's expression to a [[homotopy theory]] description of the regular homotopy classes of immersions of any ''m''-dimensional manifold ''M&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' in any ''n''-dimensional  manifold ''N&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.

The Hirsch-Smale classification of immersions was generalized by [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]].

=== Existence ===
[[File:Moebius Surface 1 Display Small.png|thumb|The [[Möbius strip]] does not immerse in codimension 0 because its tangent bundle is non-trivial.]]
The primary obstruction to the existence of an immersion {{nowrap|''i'' : ''M&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[stable normal bundle]] of ''M'', as detected by its [[characteristic classes]], notably its [[Stiefel–Whitney class]]es. That is, since '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[Parallelizable manifold|parallelizable]], the pullback of its tangent bundle to ''M'' is trivial; since this pullback is the direct sum of the (intrinsically defined) tangent bundle on ''M'', ''TM'', which has dimension ''m'', and of the normal bundle ''ν'' of the immersion ''i'', which has dimension {{nowrap|''n'' − ''m''}}, for there to be a [[codimension]] ''k'' immersion of ''M'', there must be a vector bundle of dimension ''k'', ''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, standing in for the normal bundle ''ν'', such that {{nowrap|''TM'' ⊕ ''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is trivial. Conversely, given such a bundle, an immersion of ''M'' with this normal bundle is equivalent to a codimension 0 immersion of the total space of this bundle, which is an open manifold.

The stable normal bundle is the class of normal bundles plus trivial bundles, and thus if the stable normal bundle has cohomological dimension ''k'', it cannot come from an (unstable) normal bundle of dimension less than ''k''. Thus, the cohomology dimension of the stable normal bundle, as detected by its highest non-vanishing characteristic class, is an obstruction to immersions.

Since characteristic classes multiply under direct sum of vector bundles, this obstruction can be stated intrinsically in terms of the space ''M'' and its tangent bundle and cohomology algebra. This obstruction was stated (in terms of the tangent bundle, not stable normal bundle) by Whitney.

For example, the [[Möbius strip]] has non-trivial tangent bundle, so it cannot immerse in codimension 0 (in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), though it embeds in codimension 1 (in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

Massey|first=William S.|last=Massey|year=1960|txt}} showed that these characteristic classes (the Stiefel–Whitney classes of the stable normal bundle) vanish above degree {{nowrap|''n'' − ''α''(''n'')}}, where {{nowrap|''α''(''n'')}} is the number of "1" digits when ''n'' is written in binary; this bound is sharp, as realized by [[real projective space]]. This gave evidence to the ''Immersion Conjecture'', namely that every ''n''-manifold could be immersed in codimension {{nowrap|''n'' − ''α''(''n'')}}, i.e., in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''−α(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;. This conjecture was proven by {{harvs|first=Ralph|last=Cohen|authorlink=Ralph Louis Cohen|year=1985|txt}}.

=== Codimension 0 ===
Codimension 0 immersions are equivalently [[relative dimension|''relative'' dimension]] 0 ''[[Submersion (mathematics)|submersions]]'', and are better thought of as submersions. A codimension 0 immersion of a [[closed manifold]] is precisely a [[covering map]], i.e., a [[fiber bundle]] with 0-dimensional (discrete) fiber. By [[Ehresmann's theorem]] and Phillips' theorem on submersions, a [[proper map|proper]] submersion of manifolds is a fiber bundle, hence codimension/relative dimension 0 immersions/submersions behave like submersions.

Further, codimension 0 immersions do not behave like other immersions, which are largely determined by the stable normal bundle: in codimension 0 one has issues of [[fundamental class]] and cover spaces. For instance, there is no codimension 0 immersion {{nowrap|'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, despite the circle being parallelizable, which can be proven because the line has no fundamental class, so one does not get the required map on top cohomology. Alternatively, this is by [[invariance of domain]]. Similarly, although '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the 3-torus '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are both parallelizable, there is no immersion {{nowrap|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} – any such cover would have to be ramified at some points, since the sphere is simply connected.

Another way of understanding this is that a codimension ''k'' immersion of a manifold corresponds to a codimension 0 immersion of a ''k''-dimensional vector bundle, which is an [[open manifold|''open'' manifold]] if the codimension is greater than 0, but to a closed manifold in codimension 0 (if the original manifold is closed).

==Multiple points==
A '''''k''-tuple point''' (double, triple, etc.) of an immersion {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is an unordered set {{nowrap|{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}{{null}}}} of distinct points {{nowrap|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''M''}} with the same image {{nowrap|''f''(''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') ∈ ''N''}}. If ''M'' is an ''m''-dimensional manifold and ''N'' is an ''n''-dimensional manifold then for an immersion {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} in [[general position]] the set of ''k''-tuple points is an {{nowrap|(''n'' − ''k''(''n'' − ''m''))}}-dimensional manifold.  Every embedding is an immersion without multiple points (where {{nowrap|''k'' &gt; 1}}).  Note, however, that the converse is false: there are injective immersions that are not embeddings.

The nature of the multiple points classifies immersions; for example, immersions of a circle in the plane are classified up to regular homotopy by the number of double points.

At a key point in [[surgery theory]] it is necessary to decide if an immersion {{nowrap|''f'' : '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of an ''m''-sphere in a 2''m''-dimensional manifold is regular homotopic to an embedding, in which case it can be killed by surgery. [[C.T.C. Wall|Wall]] associated to ''f'' an invariant ''μ''(''f'') in a quotient of the [[fundamental group]] ring '''Z'''[π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''N'')] which counts the double points of ''f'' in the [[universal cover]] of ''N''. For {{nowrap|''m'' &gt; 2}}, ''f'' is regular homotopic to an embedding if and only if {{nowrap|1=''μ''(''f'') = 0}} by the [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]] trick.

One can study embeddings as "immersions without multiple points", since immersions are easier to classify. Thus, one can start from immersions and try to eliminate multiple points, seeing if one can do this without introducing other singularities – studying "multiple disjunctions". This was first done by [[André Haefliger]], and this approach is fruitful in codimension 3 or more – from the point of view of surgery theory, this is "high (co)dimension", unlike codimension 2 which is the knotting dimension, as in [[knot theory]]. It is studied categorically via the "[[calculus of functors]]" by [http://www.math.brown.edu/faculty/goodwillie.html Thomas Goodwillie], [http://www.math.wayne.edu/~klein/ John Klein], and [http://www.maths.abdn.ac.uk/staff/display.php?key=m.weiss Michael S. Weiss].

==Examples and properties==
* The [[Klein bottle]], and all other non-orientable closed surfaces, can be immersed in 3-space but not embedded.
[[File:Quadrifolium.svg|thumb|The [[quadrifolium]], the 4-petaled rose.]]
* A mathematical [[Rose (mathematics)|rose]] with ''k'' petals is an immersion of the circle in the plane with a single ''k''-tuple point; ''k'' can be any odd number, but if even must be a multiple of 4, so the figure 8 is not a rose.
* By the [[Whitney–Graustein theorem]], the regular homotopy classes of immersions of the circle in the plane are classified by the [[winding number]], which is also the number of double points counted algebraically (i.e. with signs).
* The [[sphere eversion|sphere can be turned inside out]]: the standard embedding {{nowrap|''f'' : '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is related to {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} by a regular homotopy of immersions {{nowrap|''f&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' : '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* [[Boy's surface]] is an immersion of the [[real projective plane]] in 3-space; thus also a 2-to-1 immersion of the sphere.
* The [[Morin surface]] is an immersion of the sphere; both it and Boy's surface arise as midway models in sphere eversion.

=== Immersed plane curves ===
[[File:Winding Number Around Point.svg|thumb|300px|This curve has [[total curvature]] 6''π'', and [[turning number]] 3, though it only has [[winding number]] 2 about ''p''.]]
{{main|Whitney–Graustein theorem|Total curvature|Turning number}}
Immersed plane curves have a well-defined [[turning number]], which can be defined as the [[total curvature]] divided by 2''π''. This is invariant under regular homotopy, by the [[Whitney–Graustein theorem]] – topologically, it is the degree of the [[Gauss map]], or equivalently the [[winding number]] of the unit tangent (which does not vanish) about the origin. Further, this is a [[complete set of invariants]] – any two plane curves with the same turning number are regular homotopic.

Every immersed plane curve lifts to an embedded space curve via separating the intersection points, which is not true in higher dimensions. With added data (which strand is on top), immersed plane curves yield [[knot diagram]]s, which are of central interest in [[knot theory]]. While immersed plane curves, up to regular homotopy, are determined by their turning number, knots have a very rich and complex structure.

=== Immersed surfaces in 3-space ===
The study of immersed surfaces in 3-space is closely connected with the study of knotted (embedded) surfaces in 4-space, by analogy with the theory of [[knot diagram]]s (immersed plane curves (2-space) as projections of knotted curves in 3-space): given a knotted surface in 4-space, one can project it to an immersed surface in 3-space, and conversely, given an immersed surface in 3-space, one may ask if it lifts to 4-space – is it the projection of a knotted surface in 4-space? This allows one to relate questions about these objects.

A basic result, in contrast to the case of plane curves, is that not every immersed surface lifts to a knotted surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|Saito|1998}}; {{Harvnb|Carter|Kamada|Saito|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=erc9fktHqhsC&amp;pg=PA17 Remark 1.23, p. 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the obstruction is 2-torsion, such as in ''[http://www.southalabama.edu/mathstat/personal_pages/carter/nukos.jpg Koschorke's example]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Koschorke|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an immersed surface (formed from 3 Möbius bands, with a [[Tripoint (disambiguation)|triple point]]) that does not lift to a knotted surface, but it has a double cover that does lift. A detailed analysis is given in {{Harvtxt|Carter|Saito|1998}}, while a more recent survey is given in {{Harvtxt|Carter|Kamada|Saito|2004}}.

== Generalizations ==
{{main|Homotopy principle}}
A far-reaching generalization of immersion theory is the [[homotopy principle]]:
one may consider the immersion condition (the rank of the derivative is always ''k'') as a [[partial differential relation]] (PDR), as it can be stated in terms of the partial derivatives of the function. Then Smale–Hirsch immersion theory is the result that this reduces to homotopy theory, and the homotopy principle gives general conditions and reasons for PDRs to reduce to homotopy theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5659">In [[mathematics]], in the fields of [[multilinear algebra]] and [[representation theory]], '''invariants of tensors''' are coefficients of the [[characteristic polynomial]] of the [[tensor]] ''A'':&lt;ref&gt;SPENCER, A. J. M. Continuum Mechanics. Longman, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ p(\lambda):=\det (\mathbf{A}-\lambda \mathbf{E})&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity tensor and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is the polynomial's [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] (it is important to bear in mind that a polynomial's indeterminate &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; may also be a non-scalar as long as power, scaling and adding make sense for it, e.g., &lt;math&gt;p(\mathbf{A})&lt;/math&gt; is legitimate, and in fact, quite useful).

The first invariant of an ''n''&amp;times;''n'' tensor A (&lt;math&gt;I_A&lt;/math&gt;) is the coefficient for &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; (because the coefficient for &lt;math&gt; \lambda^n &lt;/math&gt; is always 1), the second invariant (&lt;math&gt;II_A&lt;/math&gt;) is the coefficient for &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;, etc., the ''n''th invariant is the free term.

==Properties==
The first invariant (trace) is always the sum of the diagonal components:
:&lt;math&gt;\ I_A=A_{11}+A_{22}+ \cdots + A_{nn}=\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A}) \, &lt;/math&gt;
The ''n''th invariant is just &lt;math&gt;\pm \det \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, the determinant of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; (up to sign).

The invariants do not change with rotation of the coordinate system (they are objective). Obviously, any function of the invariants only is also objective.

==Calculation of the invariants of symmetric 3&amp;times;3 tensors==
Most [[Application of tensor theory in engineering science|tensors used in engineering]] are symmetric 3&amp;times;3.
For this case  the invariants can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathrm{I}_A= \mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A}) = A_{11}+A_{22}+A_{33} = A_1+A_2+A_3 \,
 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{II}_A  = \frac{1}{2} \left( ( \mathrm{tr}\mathbf{A})^2 - \mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A}^2 ) \right) = A_{11}A_{22}+A_{22}A_{33}+A_{11}A_{33}-A_{12}A_{21}-A_{23}A_{32}-A_{13}A_{31}
&lt;/math&gt;

(the sum of [[principal minor]]s).  This expression holds for non-symmetric tensors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=PA|url=http://homepages.engineering.auckland.ac.nz/~pkel015/SolidMechanicsBooks/Part_III/Chapter_1_Vectors_Tensors/Vectors_Tensors_11_Eigenvalue.pdf|website=Lecture Notes: An introduction to Solid Mechanics|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; = A_1A_2+A_2A_3+A_1A_3 \\
\mathrm{III}_A &amp; = \det (\mathbf{A})= A_1 A_2 A_3
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_3&lt;/math&gt; are the [[eigenvalues]] of tensor&amp;nbsp;''A''.

Because of the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] the following equation is always true:
:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf{A}^3 - \mathrm{I}_A \mathbf{A}^2 +\mathrm{II}_A \mathbf{A} -\mathrm{III}_A \mathbf{E}= 0&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is the second-order identity tensor.

A similar equation holds for tensors of higher order.

==Engineering application==
A scalar valued tensor function ''f'' that depends merely on the three invariants of a symmetric 3&amp;times;3 tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is objective, i.e., independent from rotations of the coordinate system. Moreover, every objective tensor function depends only on the tensor's invariants. Thus, objectivity of a tensor function is fulfilled if, and only if, for some function &lt;math&gt;\ g:R^3\to R &lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ f(\mathbf A)=g(I_A,II_A,III_A). \, &lt;/math&gt;

A common application to this is the evaluation of the potential energy as function of the strain tensor, within the framework of linear elasticity. Exhausting the above theorem the free energy of the system reduces to a function of 3 scalar parameters rather than 6. Within linear elasticity the free energy has to be quadratic in the tensor's elements, which eliminates an additional scalar. Thus, for an isotropic material only two independent parameters are needed to describe the elastic properties, known as Lamé coefficients. Consequently, experimental fits and computational efforts may be eased significantly.

This technique was first introduced into isotropic [[turbulence]] by [[Howard P. Robertson]] in 1940&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, H. P. (1940, April). The invariant theory of isotropic turbulence. In Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (Vol. 36, No. 2, pp. 209-223). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was able to derive [[Kármán–Howarth equation]] from the invariant principle. [[George Batchelor]] and [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] exploited this technique by extending to axisymmetric turbulence&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, G. K. (1946). The theory of axisymmetric turbulence. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, 186(1007), 480-502.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1950). The theory of axisymmetric turbulence. Royal Society of London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1950). The decay of axisymmetric turbulence. Proc. Roy. Soc. A, 203, 358-364.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Other invariants==

Since the invariants are constant in any reference, functions of invariants are also constant. Some sources define the three invariants of the 3&amp;times;3 tensors as

:&lt;math&gt;I_1 = tr(\mathbf{A}) = A_{ii}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_2 = tr(\mathbf{A}^2) = A_{ij}A_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;  This expression only holds for symmetric tensors.
:&lt;math&gt;I_3 = tr(\mathbf{A}^3) = A_{ij}A_{jk}A_{ki}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;I_A = I_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;II_A = \frac{1}{2}(I_1^2 - I_2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;III_A = \frac{1}{6}(I_1^3 - 3 I_1 I_2 + 2 I_3)&lt;/math&gt;

Label Propagation is a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that assigns labels to previously unlabeled data points. At the start of the algorithm, a (generally small) subset of the data points have labels (or classifications). These labels are propagated to the unlabeled points throughout the course of the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Xiaojin|title=Learning From Labeled and Unlabeled Data With Label Propagation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[complex networks]], real networks tend to have [[community structure]]. Label propagation is an algorithm &lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"&gt;U.N.Raghavan – R. Albert – S. Kumara [https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2938 "Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks"], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; for finding communities. In comparison with other algorithms&lt;ref&gt;M. E. J. Newman, [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/papers/epjb.pdf "Detecting community structure in networks"], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; label propagation has advantages in its running time and amount of a priori information needed about the network structure (no parameter is required to be known beforehand). The disadvantage is that it produces no unique solution, but an aggregate of many solutions.

==Functioning of the Algorithm==

At initial condition, the nodes carry a label that denotes the community they belong to. Membership in a community changes based on the labels that the neighboring nodes possess. This change is subject to the maximum number of labels within one degree of the nodes. Every node is initialized with a unique label, then the labels diffuse through the network. Consequently, densely connected groups reach a common label quickly. When many such dense (consensus) groups are created throughout the network, they continue to expand outwards until it is impossible to do so.&lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"/&gt;

The process has 5 steps:&lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"/&gt;

1. Initialize the labels at all nodes in the network. For a given node x, C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (0) = x.

2. Set t = 1.

3. Arrange the nodes in the network in a random order and set it to X.

4. For each x ∈ X chosen in that specific order, let C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = f(C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ...,C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;im&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(t),C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;i(m+1)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (t − 1), ...,C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (t − 1)). f here returns the label occurring with the highest frequency among neighbours.

5. If every node has a label that the maximum number of their neighbours have, then stop the algorithm. Else, set t = t + 1 and go to (3).

==Multiple Community Structure==

In contrast with other algorithms label propagation can result in various community structures from the same initial condition. The range of solutions can be narrowed if some nodes are given preliminary labels while others are held unlabelled. Consequently, unlabelled nodes will be more likely to adapt to the labelled ones. For a more accurate finding of communities, [[Jaccard index|Jaccard’s index]] is used to aggregate multiple community structures, containing all important information.&lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3093">In mathematics, '''Landau's function''' ''g''(''n''), named after [[Edmund Landau]], is defined for every [[natural number]] ''n'' to be the largest [[order (group theory)|order]] of an element of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Equivalently, ''g''(''n'') is the largest [[least common multiple]] (lcm) of any [[integer partition|partition]] of ''n'', or the maximum number of times a [[permutation]] of ''n'' elements can be recursively applied to itself before it returns to its starting sequence.

For instance, 5 = 2 + 3 and lcm(2,3) = 6. No other partition of 5 yields a bigger lcm, so ''g''(5) = 6. An element of order 6 in the group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; can be written in cycle notation as (1 2) (3 4 5). Note that the same argument applies to the number 6, that is, ''g''(6)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6. There are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive numbers ''n'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, &amp;hellip;, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m'' on which the function ''g'' is constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Nicolas|first=Jean-Louis|author-link=Jean-Louis Nicolas|title=Sur l’ordre maximum d’un  élément dans le groupe ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' des permutations|journal=[[Acta Arithmetica]]|volume=14|year=1968|pages=315–332|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[integer sequence]] ''g''(0) = 1, ''g''(1) = 1, ''g''(2) = 2, ''g''(3) = 3, ''g''(4) = 4, ''g''(5) = 6, ''g''(6) = 6, ''g''(7) = 12, ''g''(8) = 15, ... {{OEIS|A000793}} is named after [[Edmund Landau]], who proved in 1902&lt;ref&gt;Landau, pp. 92–103&lt;/ref&gt; that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\ln(g(n))}{\sqrt{n \ln(n)}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
(where ln denotes the [[natural logarithm]]).  In other words, &lt;math&gt;g(n) = e^{(1+o(1))\sqrt{n\ln n}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The statement that
:&lt;math&gt;\ln g(n)&lt;\sqrt{\mathrm{Li}^{-1}(n)}&lt;/math&gt;
for all sufficiently large ''n'', where Li&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the inverse of the [[logarithmic integral function]], is equivalent to the [[Riemann hypothesis]].

It can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;g(n)&lt;e^{n/e}&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}
and indeed
:&lt;math&gt;g(n) \le \exp\left(1.05314\sqrt{n\ln n}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Massias, Majoration explicite de l'ordre maximum d'un élément du groupe symétrique, ''Ann. Fac. Sci. Toulouse Math.'' (5) 6 (1984), no. 3-4, pp. 269–281 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''lute of Pythagoras''' is a [[Self-similarity|self-similar]] [[geometry|geometric figure]] made from a sequence of [[pentagram]]s.

==Constructions==
The lute may be drawn from a sequence of [[pentagram]]s.
The centers of the pentagraphs lie on a line and (except for the first and largest of them) each shares two [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] with the next larger one in the sequence.&lt;ref name="guilberg"&gt;{{citation|title=Mathematics: From the Birth of Numbers|first=Jan|last=Gullberg|publisher=W.

An alternative construction is based on the [[Golden triangle (mathematics)|golden triangle]], an [[isosceles triangle]] with base angles of 72° and apex angle 36°. Two smaller copies of the same triangle may be drawn inside the given triangle, having the base of the triangle as one of their sides. The two new edges of these two smaller triangles, together with the base of the original golden triangle, form three of the five edges of the polygon. Adding a segment between the endpoints of these two new edges cuts off a smaller golden triangle, within which the construction can be repeated.&lt;ref name="lamb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ellison"&gt;{{citation|contribution=Create a Mathematical Banner Using the Lute, the Sacred Cut, and the Spidron|first=Elaine Krajenke|last=Ellison|pages=467–468|url=http://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2008/bridges2008-467.html|year=2008|title=Bridges Leeuwarden: Mathematics, Music, Art, Architecture, Culture}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources add another pentagram, inscribed within the inner pentagon of the largest pentagram of the figure. The other pentagons of the figure do not have inscribed pentagrams.&lt;ref name="lamb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ellison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pickover"&gt;{{citation|title=A Passion for Mathematics: Numbers, Puzzles, Madness, Religion, and the Quest for Reality|first=Clifford A.|last=Pickover|authorlink=Clifford A.

==Properties==
The [[convex hull]] of the lute is a [[kite (geometry)|kite shape]] with three 108° angles and one 36° angle.&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt;  The sizes of any two consecutive pentagrams in the sequence are in the [[golden ratio]] to each other, and many other instances of the golden ratio appear within the lute.&lt;ref name="guilberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ellison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pickover"/&gt;

He is a professor at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] and a distinguished professor at the [[University of Miami]]. He received the [[Henri Poincaré Prize]] in 1997, the [[Fields Medal]] in 1998, the [[Crafoord Prize]] in 2008, the [[Shaw Prize]] and [[Fundamental Physics Prize]] in 2012, and the [[Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chang|first1=Kenneth|title=The Multimillion-Dollar Minds of 5 Mathematical Masters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/us/the-multimillion-dollar-minds-of-5-mathematical-masters.html?_r=0|agency=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
He was born into the family of Lev Rafailovich Kontsevich, Soviet orientalist and author of the [[Kontsevich system]]. After ranking second in the All-Union Mathematics Olympiads, he attended [[Moscow State University]] but left without a degree in 1985 to become a researcher at the [[Institute for Problems of Information Transmission]] in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/1994/1012/math.html　A Very Pleasurable Universe&lt;/ref&gt; While at the institute he managed to publish some papers that got the interest of the Max Planck institute in Bonn so he got invited for 3 months there just before its end he attended a 5 day international meeting:the Arbeitstagung,he sketched a proof of the Witten conjecture to the amazement of Michael Atiyah and other mathematicians so his invitation to the institute was extended to 3 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/1994/1012/math.html|title=10.12.94 - Very Pleasurable Universe|website=www.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;,the next year he finished the proof and worked on various topics on mathematical physics and in 1992 received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Bonn]] under [[Don Bernard Zagier]]. His thesis outlines a proof of a conjecture by [[Edward Witten]] that two [[Quantum gravity|quantum gravitational models]] are equivalent.

His work concentrates on geometric aspects of [[mathematical physics]], most notably on [[knot theory]], [[quantization (physics)|quantization]], and [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].  One of his results is a formal [[Quantization (physics)|deformation quantization]] that holds for any [[Poisson manifold]].  He also introduced knot invariants defined by complicated integrals analogous to [[path integral formulation|Feynman integrals]].  In [[topological field theory]], he introduced the [[stable map|moduli space of stable maps]], which may be considered a mathematically rigorous formulation of the [[path integral formulation|Feynman integral]] for topological string theory.

==Honors and awards==
In 1998, he won the [[Fields Medal]] for his "contributions to four problems of Geometry". In July 2012, he was an inaugural awardee of the [[Fundamental Physics Prize]], the creation of physicist and internet entrepreneur, [[Yuri Milner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fundamentalphysicsprize.org/news.html New annual US$3 million Fundamental Physics Prize recognizes transformative advances in the field] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803211628/http://www.fundamentalphysicsprize.org/news.html |date=2012-08-03 }}, FPP, accessed 1 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he was awarded Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics.

In [[number theory]], '''Meyer's theorem''' on [[quadratic form]]s states that an [[indefinite quadratic form]] ''Q'' in five or more variables over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[rational number]]s nontrivially represents zero. In other words, if the equation

:''Q''(''x'') = 0

has a non-zero [[real number|real]] solution, then it has a non-zero rational solution (the converse is obvious). By clearing the denominators, an integral solution ''x'' may also be found.

Meyer's theorem is usually deduced from the [[Hasse–Minkowski theorem]] (which was proved later) and the following statement: 

: A rational quadratic form in five or more variables represents zero over the field '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[p-adic number]]s  for all ''p''.

Meyer's theorem is best possible with respect to the number of variables: there are indefinite rational quadratic forms ''Q'' in four variables which do not represent zero. One family of examples is given by 

:''Q''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''p''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),

where ''p'' is a [[prime number]] that is [[modular arithmetic|congruent]] to 3 modulo 4. This can be proved by the method of [[infinite descent]] using the fact that if the sum of two [[square number|perfect squares]] is divisible by such a ''p'' then each summand is divisible by ''p''.

In [[graph theory]], a '''nested triangles graph''' with ''n'' [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] is a [[planar graph]] formed from a sequence of ''n''/3 triangles, by connecting pairs of corresponding vertices on consecutive triangles in the sequence. It can also be formed geometrically, by gluing together ''n''/3&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 [[triangular prism]]s on their triangular faces.
This graph, and graphs closely related to it, have been frequently used in [[graph drawing]] to prove lower bounds on the [[Area (graph drawing)|area requirements]] of various styles of drawings.

==Polyhedral representation==
[[File:Triangular bifrustum.png|thumb|left|[[Triangular bifrustum]]]]
The nested triangles graph with two triangles is the graph of the [[triangular prism]], and the nested triangles graph with three triangles is the graph of the [[triangular bifrustum]].
More generally, because the nested triangles graphs are planar and [[k-vertex-connected graph|3-vertex-connected]], it follows from [[Steinitz's theorem]] that they all can be represented as convex polyhedra.

An alternative geometric representation of these graphs may be given by gluing triangular prisms end-to-end on their triangular faces; the number of nested triangles is one more than the number of glued prisms. However, using right prisms, this gluing process will cause the rectangular faces of adjacent prisms to be coplanar, so the result will not be strictly convex.

==Area lower bounds for graph drawings==

The nested triangles graph was named by {{harvtxt|Dolev|Leighton|Trickey|1984}}, who used it to show that drawing an ''n''-vertex planar graph in the [[integer lattice]] (with [[Fáry's theorem|straight line-segment edges]]) may require a [[bounding box]] of size at least ''n''/3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n''/3.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

If the outer face is not allowed to be chosen as part of the drawing algorithm, but is specified as part of the input, the same argument shows that a bounding box of size 2''n''/3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2''n''/3 is necessary, and a drawing with these dimensions exists.

For drawings in which the outer face may be freely chosen, the area lower bound of {{harvtxt|Dolev|Leighton|Trickey|1984}} may not be tight.
{{harvtxt|Frati|Patrignani|2008}} showed that this graph, and any graph formed by adding diagonals to its quadrilaterals, can be drawn within a box of dimensions ''n''/3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2''n''/3. When no extra diagonals are added the nested triangles graph itself can be drawn in even smaller area, approximately ''n''/3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n''/2, as shown. Closing the gap between the 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/9 upper bound and the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/9 lower bound on drawing area for completions of the nested triangle graph remains an open problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5291">In [[geometric graph theory]], and the theory of [[structural rigidity]], a '''parallel redrawing''' of a [[graph drawing]] with straight edges in the [[Euclidean plane]] or higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is another drawing of the same graph such that all edges of the second drawing are parallel to their corresponding edges in the first drawing. A '''parallel morph''' of a graph is a continuous family of drawings, all parallel redrawings of each other.

Parallel redrawings include [[Translation (geometry)|translations]], [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]], and other modifications of the drawing that change it more locally. For instance, for graphs drawn as the vertices or edges of a [[simple polyhedron]], a parallel drawing can be obtained by translating the plane of one of the polyhedron's face, and adjusting the positions of the vertices and edges that border that face.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[structural rigidity]], the existence of ([[infinitesimal]]) parallel redrawings of a structural framework is dual to the existence of an infinitesimal motion, one that preserves its edge lengths but not their orientations. Thus, a framework has one kind of motion if it has the other kind, but detecting the existence of a parallel redrawing may be easier than detecting the existence of an infinitesimal motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is closely related to the family of [[top-down parsing language]]s introduced in the early 1970s.
Syntactically, PEGs also look similar to [[context-free grammar]]s (CFGs), but they have a different interpretation: the choice operator selects the first match in PEG, while it is ambiguous in CFG. This is closer to how string recognition tends to be done in practice, e.g. by a [[recursive descent parser]].

Unlike CFGs, PEGs cannot be [[ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]]; if a string parses, it has exactly one valid [[parse tree]]. It is conjectured that there exist context-free languages that cannot be recognized by a PEG, but this is not yet proven.&lt;ref name="For04" /&gt; PEGs are well-suited to parsing computer languages (and artificial human languages such as [[Lojban]]), but not [[natural language]]s where the performance of PEG algorithms is comparable to general CFG algorithms such as the [[Earley algorithm]].&lt;ref name="pegs"&gt;

== Definition ==

=== Syntax ===
Formally, a parsing expression grammar consists of:
* A finite set ''N'' of ''[[nonterminal symbol]]s''.
* A finite set Σ of ''[[terminal symbol]]s'' that is [[disjoint_sets|disjoint]] from ''N''.
* A finite set ''P'' of ''parsing rules''.
* An expression ''e&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' termed the ''starting expression''.

Each parsing rule in ''P'' has the form ''A'' ← ''e'', where ''A'' is a nonterminal symbol and ''e'' is a ''parsing expression''. A parsing expression is a hierarchical [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] similar to a [[regular expression]], which is constructed in the following fashion:
# An ''atomic parsing expression'' consists of:
#* any terminal symbol,
#* any nonterminal symbol, or
#* the empty string ε.
# Given any existing parsing expressions ''e'', ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a new parsing expression can be constructed using the following operators:
#* ''Sequence'': ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
#* ''Ordered choice'': ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
#* ''Zero-or-more'': ''e''*
#* ''One-or-more'': ''e''+
#* ''Optional'': ''e''?
#* ''And-predicate'': &amp;''e''
#* ''Not-predicate'': !''e''

=== Semantics ===

The fundamental difference between [[context-free grammars]] and parsing expression grammars is that the PEG's choice operator is ''ordered''. If the first alternative succeeds, the second alternative is ignored. Thus ordered choice is not [[commutativity|commutative]], unlike unordered choice as in context-free grammars. Ordered choice is analogous to [[cut (logic programming)|soft cut]] operators available in some [[logic programming]] languages.

The consequence is that if a CFG is transliterated directly to a PEG, any ambiguity in the former is resolved by deterministically picking one parse tree from the possible parses. By carefully choosing the order in which the grammar alternatives are specified, a programmer has a great deal of control over which parse tree is selected.

Like [[Boolean grammar|boolean context-free grammars]], parsing expression grammars also add the and- and not- [[syntactic predicate]]s. Because they can use an arbitrarily complex sub-expression to "look ahead" into the input string without actually consuming it, they provide a powerful syntactic [[Parsing#Lookahead|lookahead]] and disambiguation facility, in particular when reordering the alternatives cannot specify the exact parse tree desired.

=== Operational interpretation of parsing expressions ===
Each nonterminal in a parsing expression grammar essentially represents a parsing [[function (mathematics)|function]] in a [[recursive descent parser]], and the corresponding parsing expression represents the "code" comprising the function. Each parsing function conceptually takes an input string as its argument, and yields one of the following results:
* ''success'', in which the function may optionally move forward or ''consume'' one or more characters of the input string supplied to it, or
* ''failure'', in which case no input is consumed.

An atomic parsing expression consisting of a single '''terminal''' (i.e. literal) succeeds if the first character of the input string matches that terminal, and in that case consumes the input character; otherwise the expression yields a failure result. An atomic parsing expression consisting of the empty string always trivially succeeds without consuming any input.
 
An atomic parsing expression consisting of a '''nonterminal''' ''A'' represents a [[recursion|recursive]] call to the nonterminal-function ''A''. A nonterminal may succeed without actually consuming any input, and this is considered an outcome distinct from failure.

The '''sequence''' operator ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; first invokes ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and if ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; succeeds, subsequently invokes ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the remainder of the input string left unconsumed by ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and returns the result. If either ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fails, then the sequence expression ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fails.

The '''choice''' operator ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; first invokes ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and if ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; succeeds, returns its result immediately. Otherwise, if ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; fails, then the choice operator [[backtracking|backtracks]] to the original input position at which it invoked ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but then calls ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instead, returning ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'s result.

The '''zero-or-more''', '''one-or-more''', and '''optional''' operators consume zero or more, one or more, or zero or one consecutive repetitions of their sub-expression ''e'', respectively. Unlike in [[context-free grammar]]s and [[regular expression]]s, however, these operators ''always'' behave [[greedy algorithm|greedily]], consuming as much input as possible and never backtracking. (Regular expression matchers may start by matching greedily, but will then backtrack and try shorter matches if they fail to match.) For example, the expression a* will always consume as many a's as are consecutively available in the input string, and the expression (a* a) will always fail because the first part (a*) will never leave any a's for the second part to match.

The '''and-predicate''' expression &amp;''e'' invokes the sub-expression ''e'', and then succeeds if ''e'' succeeds and fails if ''e'' fails, but in either case ''never consumes any input''.

The '''not-predicate''' expression !''e'' succeeds if ''e'' fails and fails if ''e'' succeeds, again consuming no input in either case.

=== Examples ===
This is a PEG that recognizes mathematical formulas that apply the basic four operations to non-negative integers.
&lt;pre&gt;
Expr    &amp;larr; Sum
Sum     &amp;larr; Product (('+' / '-') Product)*
Product &amp;larr; Value (('*' / '/') Value)*
Value   &amp;larr; [0-9]+ / '(' Expr ')'
&lt;/pre&gt;
In the above example, the terminal symbols are characters of text, represented by characters in single quotes, such as &lt;code&gt;'('&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;')'&lt;/code&gt;. The range '''&lt;code&gt;[0-9]&lt;/code&gt;''' is also a shortcut for ten characters, indicating any one of the digits 0 through 9. (This range syntax is the same as the syntax used by [[regular expression]]s.) The nonterminal symbols are the ones that expand to other rules: ''Value'', ''Product'', ''Sum'', and ''Expr''.

The following recursive rule matches standard C-style if/then/else statements in such a way that the optional "else" clause always binds to the innermost "if", because of the implicit prioritization of the '/' operator. (In a [[context-free grammar]], this construct yields the classic [[dangling else]] [[ambiguous|ambiguity]].)
&lt;pre&gt;
S &amp;larr; 'if' C 'then' S 'else' S / 'if' C 'then' S
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following recursive rule matches Pascal-style nested comment syntax, (* which can (* nest *) like this *). The comment symbols appear in single quotes to distinguish them from PEG operators.
&lt;pre&gt;
Begin &amp;larr; '(*'
End   &amp;larr; '*)'
C     &amp;larr; Begin N* End
N     &amp;larr; C / (!Begin !End Z)
Z     &amp;larr; any single character
&lt;/pre&gt;

The parsing expression '''foo &amp;(bar)''' matches and consumes the text "foo" but only if it is followed by the text "bar". The parsing expression '''foo !(bar)''' matches the text "foo" but only if it is ''not'' followed by the text "bar".  The expression '''!(a+ b) a''' matches a single "a" but only if it is not part of an arbitrarily long sequence of a's followed by a b.

The parsing expression '''('a'/'b')*''' matches and consumes an arbitrary-length sequence of a's and b's. The [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|production rule]] {{nowrap|'''''S'' ← 'a' ''S''? 'b''''}} describes the simple [[context-free language|context-free]] "matching language" &lt;math&gt; \{ a^n b^n : n \ge 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;.
The following parsing expression grammar describes the classic non-context-free language &lt;math&gt; \{ a^n b^n c^n : n \ge 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
S &amp;larr; &amp;(A 'c') 'a'+ B !.
A &amp;larr; 'a' A? 'b'
B &amp;larr; 'b' B? 'c'
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Implementing parsers from parsing expression grammars ==
Any parsing expression grammar can be converted directly into a [[recursive descent parser]].&lt;ref name="ford02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/thesis|title=Packrat Parsing: a Practical Linear-Time Algorithm with Backtracking|last=Ford|first=Bryan|date=September 2002|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-07-27}}

Ford, Bryan, ''Packrat Parsing: a Practical Linear-Time Algorithm with Backtracking'', Master’s thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, September, 2002, http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/thesis/

--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the unlimited [[Parsing#Lookahead|lookahead]] capability that the grammar formalism provides, however, the resulting parser could exhibit [[exponential time]] performance in the worst case.

It is possible to obtain better performance for any parsing expression grammar by converting its recursive descent parser into a ''packrat parser'', which always runs in [[linear time]], at the cost of substantially greater storage space requirements. A packrat parser&lt;ref name="ford02" /&gt;
is a form of [[parsing|parser]] similar to a recursive descent parser in construction, except that during the parsing process it [[memoization|memoizes]] the intermediate results of all invocations of the [[mutual recursion|mutually recursive]] parsing functions, ensuring that each parsing function is only invoked at most once at a given input position. Because of this memoization, a packrat parser has the ability to parse many [[context-free grammar]]s and ''any'' parsing expression grammar (including some that do not represent context-free languages) in linear time. Examples of memoized recursive descent parsers are known from at least as early as 1993.&lt;ref name="merritt01"&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://compilers.iecc.com/comparch/article/93-11-012
|title=Transparent Recursive Descent
|accessdate=2009-09-04
|last=Merritt
|first=Doug
|date=November 1993
|publisher=Usenet group comp.compilers
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Note that this analysis of the performance of a packrat parser assumes that enough memory is available to hold all of the memoized results; in practice, if there is not enough memory, some parsing functions might have to be invoked more than once at the same input position, and consequently the parser could take more than linear time.

It is also possible to build [[LL parser]]s and [[LR parser]]s from parsing expression grammars, with better worst-case performance than a recursive descent parser, but the unlimited lookahead capability of the grammar formalism is then lost.  Therefore, not all languages that can be expressed using parsing expression grammars can be parsed by LL or LR parsers.

== Advantages ==
Compared to pure [[regular expressions]] (i.e. without back-references), PEGs are strictly more powerful, but require significantly more memory. For example, a regular expression inherently cannot find an arbitrary number of matched pairs of parentheses, because it is not recursive, but a PEG can.  However, a PEG will require an amount of memory proportional to the length of the input, while a regular expression matcher will require only a constant amount of memory.

Any PEG can be parsed in linear time by using a packrat parser, as described above.

Many CFGs contain ambiguities, even when they're intended to describe unambiguous languages. The "[[dangling else]]" problem in C, C++, and Java is one example. These problems are often resolved by applying a rule outside of the grammar. In a PEG, these ambiguities never arise, because of prioritization.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Memory consumption ===
PEG parsing is typically carried out via ''packrat parsing'', which uses [[memoization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to eliminate redundant parsing steps. Packrat parsing requires storage proportional to the total input size, rather than the depth of the parse tree as with LR parsers. This is a significant difference in many domains: for example, hand-written source code has an effectively constant expression nesting depth independent of the length of the program—expressions nested beyond a certain depth tend to get refactored.

For some grammars and some inputs, the depth of the parse tree can be proportional to the input size,&lt;ref&gt;for example, the LISP expression (x (x (x (x ....))))&lt;/ref&gt;
so both an LR parser and a packrat parser will appear to have the same worst-case asymptotic performance. A more accurate analysis would take the depth of the parse tree into account separately from the input size. This is similar to a situation which arises in [[graph algorithms]]: the [[Bellman–Ford algorithm]] and [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]] appear to have the same running time (&lt;math&gt;O(|V|^3)&lt;/math&gt;) if only the number of vertices is considered. However, a more precise analysis which accounts for the number of edges as a separate parameter assigns the [[Bellman–Ford algorithm]] a time of &lt;math&gt;O(|V|*|E|)&lt;/math&gt;, which is quadratic for sparse graphs with &lt;math&gt;|E| \in O(|V|)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Indirect left recursion ===

A PEG is called ''well-formed''&lt;ref name="For04"/&gt; if it contains no ''[[left recursion|left-recursive]]'' rules, i.e., rules that allow a nonterminal to expand to an expression in which the same nonterminal occurs as the leftmost symbol. For a left-to-right top-down parser, such rules cause infinite regress: parsing will continually expand the same nonterminal without moving forward in the string.

Therefore, to allow packrat parsing, left recursion must be eliminated. For example, in the arithmetic grammar below, it would be tempting to move some rules around so that the precedence order of products and sums could be expressed in one line:

&lt;pre&gt;
Value   &amp;larr; [0-9.]+ / '(' Expr ')'
Product &amp;larr; Expr (('*' / '/') Expr)*
Sum     &amp;larr; Expr (('+' / '-') Expr)*
Expr    &amp;larr; Product / Sum / Value
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this new grammar, matching an &lt;tt&gt;Expr&lt;/tt&gt; requires testing if a &lt;tt&gt;Product&lt;/tt&gt; matches while matching a &lt;tt&gt;Product&lt;/tt&gt; requires testing if an &lt;tt&gt;Expr&lt;/tt&gt; matches. Because the term appears in the leftmost position, these rules make up a [[circular definition]] that cannot be resolved.  (Circular definitions that can be resolved exist—such as in the original formulation from the first example—but such definitions are required not to exhibit pathological recursion.)  However, left-recursive rules can always be rewritten to eliminate left-recursion.&lt;ref name="pegs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AhoSethiUllman 1986"&gt;Aho, A.V., Sethi, R. and Ullman, J.D. (1986) "Compilers: principles, techniques, and tools." ''[[Addison-Wesley Longman]] Publishing Co., Inc. Boston, MA, USA.''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the following left-recursive CFG rule:
&lt;pre&gt;
string-of-a &amp;larr; string-of-a 'a' | 'a'
&lt;/pre&gt;

can be rewritten in a PEG using the plus operator:
&lt;pre&gt;
string-of-a &amp;larr; 'a'+
&lt;/pre&gt;

The process of rewriting [[Left recursion#Indirect left recursion|''indirectly'' left-recursive]] rules is complex in some packrat parsers, especially when semantic actions are involved.

With some modification, traditional packrat parsing can support direct left recursion,&lt;ref name="ford02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="warth08"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but doing so results in a loss of the linear-time parsing property&lt;ref name="warth08"/&gt; which is generally the justification for using PEGs and packrat parsing in the first place.  Only the [[OMeta]] parsing algorithm&lt;ref name="ometa08"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; supports full direct and indirect left recursion without additional attendant complexity (but again, at a loss of the linear time complexity), whereas all [[GLR parser]]s support left recursion.

=== Expressive power ===

PEG packrat parsers cannot recognize some unambiguous nondeterministic CFG rules, such as the following:&lt;ref name="pegs"/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
S &amp;larr; 'x' S 'x' | 'x'
&lt;/pre&gt;
Neither [[LL(k)]] nor LR(k) parsing algorithms are capable of recognizing this example. However, this grammar can be used by a general CFG parser like the [[CYK algorithm]]. Note however that the ''language'' in question can be recognised by all these types of parser, since it is in fact a regular language (that of strings of an odd number of x's).

It is an open problem to give a concrete example of a context-free language which cannot be recognized by a parsing expression grammar.&lt;ref name="For04" /&gt;

=== Ambiguity Detection ===
LL(k) and LR(k) parser generators will fail to complete when the input grammar is ambiguous. This is a feature in the common case that the grammar is intended to be unambiguous but is defective. A PEG parser generator will resolve unintended ambiguities earliest-match-first, which may be arbitrary and lead to surprising parses.

'''''Pi Day Die Day''''' is a 2016 [[horror comedy]] produced by One Stoplight Productions and Cullen Park Productions that revolves around a group of detectives seeking to thwart the plans of a killer at a local high school on [[Pi Day]]. It was directed by Michael E. Cullen II and written by Lindsey LaForest and stars [[Ari Lehman]]. Shot on location in Ohio, a fundraising campaign was started on Indiegogo to help supplement the film's budget. The film had its official premiere on March 12, 2016, gathering mixed reviews, and was also released on home media.

==Plot==
A killer is on the loose at a respectable high school in Euclid Falls, and the principal and a group of detectives must enlist the help of a mathematics teacher to discover the killer's identity and thwart his diabolical plans.

==Production==
''Pie Day Die Day'' was directed by Michael E. Cullen II, and most of the filming took place in [[Haskins, Ohio|Haskins]], [[Ohio]]; the film was written by co-producer Lindsey LaForest, who described it as a "slashomedy" ([[slasher film|slasher]]-cum-[[comedy film|comedy]]).&lt;ref name=ToledoCity/&gt; Actor Colton Tapp, who stars in the film, also expressed that the film "pays homage to the big teen slashers".&lt;ref name=DigitalJournal&gt;{{cite news|last=Peel|first=Adrian|newspaper=Digital Journal|date=May 12, 2016|title=An exchange of dialogue with up and coming actor Colton Tapp|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/entertainment/an-exchange-of-dialogue-with-up-and-coming-actor-colton-tapp/article/465136/|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101181610/http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/entertainment/an-exchange-of-dialogue-with-up-and-coming-actor-colton-tapp/article/465136/|archivedate=November 1, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire cast comprises "local talent"&lt;ref name=13abc&gt;{{cite news|date=March 12, 2016|title="Pi Day, Die Day" is a calculated horror movie|newspaper=13abc|url=http://www.13abc.com/home/headlines/Pi-Day-Die-Day-is-a-calculated-horror-movie-371875842.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Tapp and Ari Lehman (''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]''),&lt;ref name=DigitalJournal/&gt; as well as comedian Steve Sabo, who made a cameo appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.starherald.com/news/local_news/elks-lodge-brings-the-funny-with-comedian-steve-sabo/article_368b248c-d330-5748-be99-5d2534252d65.html|newspaper=Star Herald|title=Elks Lodge brings the funny with comedian Steve Sabo|last=Heaney|first=Aaron|date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Stoplight Productions and Cullen Productions also received an additional $3,970 in funds through the crowdfunding website [[Indiegogo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pi-day-die-day-filming-in-northwest-ohio#/|title=Pi Day Die Day filming in Northwest Ohio|accessdate=June 21, 2016|publisher=Indiegogo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Machine learning with quantum computers==

Quantum-enhanced machine learning refers to [[quantum algorithm]]s that solve tasks in machine learning, thereby improving a classical machine learning method. Such algorithms typically require one to encode the given classical dataset into a quantum computer to make it accessible for quantum information processing. After this, quantum information processing routines can be applied and the result of the quantum computation is read out by measuring the quantum system. For example, the outcome of the measurement of a qubit could reveal the result of a binary classification task. While many proposals of quantum machine learning algorithms are still purely theoretical and require a full-scale universal [[quantum computer]] to be tested, others have been implemented on small-scale or special purpose quantum devices.

===Linear algebra simulation with quantum amplitudes===

A number of quantum algorithms for machine learning are based on the idea of ''amplitude encoding'', that is, to associate the [[Probability amplitude|amplitudes]] of a quantum state with the inputs and outputs of computations.&lt;ref name="Patrick Rebentrost 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.130503|pmid=25302877|title=Quantum Support Vector Machine for Big Data Classification|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=113|issue=13|pages=130503|year=2014|last1=Rebentrost|first1=Patrick|last2=Mohseni|first2=Masoud|last3=Lloyd|first3=Seth|bibcode=2014PhRvL.113m0503R|arxiv=1307.0471|hdl=1721.1/90391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nathan Wiebe 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.050505|pmid=23006156|title=Quantum Algorithm for Data Fitting|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=109|issue=5|pages=050505|year=2012|last1=Wiebe|first1=Nathan|last2=Braun|first2=Daniel|last3=Lloyd|first3=Seth|bibcode=2012PhRvL.109e0505W|arxiv=1204.5242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maria Schuld 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.94.022342|title=Prediction by linear regression on a quantum computer|journal=Physical Review A|volume=94|issue=2|pages=022342|year=2016|last1=Schuld|first1=Maria|last2=Sinayskiy|first2=Ilya|last3=Petruccione|first3=Francesco|bibcode=2016PhRvA..94b2342S|arxiv=1601.07823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1512.03929 |last1=Zhao |first1=Zhikuan |title=Quantum assisted Gaussian process regression |last2=Fitzsimons |first2=Jack K. |last3=Fitzsimons |first3=Joseph F. |class=quant-ph |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a state of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;qubits is described by &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; complex amplitudes, this information encoding can allow for an exponentially compact representation. Intuitively, this corresponds to associating a discrete probability distribution over binary random variables with a classical vector. The goal of algorithms based on amplitude encoding is to formulate quantum algorithms whose resources grow polynomially in the number of qubits &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which amounts to a logarithmic growth in the number of amplitudes and thereby the dimension of the input.

Many quantum machine learning algorithms in this category are based on variations of the [[quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=0811.3171 |last1=Harrow |first1=Aram W. |title=Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=103 |issue=15 |pages=150502 |last2=Hassidim |first2=Avinatan |last3=Lloyd |first3=Seth |year=2008 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502|pmid=19905613 |bibcode=2009PhRvL.103o0502H }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, under specific conditions, performs a matrix inversion using an amount of physical resources growing only logarithmically in the dimensions of the matrix. One of these conditions is that a Hamiltonian which entrywise corresponds to the matrix can be simulated efficiently, which is known to be possible if the matrix is sparse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= |title=Hamiltonian simulation with nearly optimal dependence on all parameters |last1=Berry |first1= Dominic W.|last2=Childs |first2=Andrew M.|last3=Kothari|first3=Robin|date=2015 |publisher=IEEE |pages=792–809 |conference= 56th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|doi=10.1109/FOCS.2015.54|arxiv=1501.01715}}&lt;/ref&gt; or low rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nphys3029|title=Quantum principal component analysis|journal=Nature Physics|volume=10|issue=9|pages=631|year=2014|last1=Lloyd|first1=Seth|last2=Mohseni|first2=Masoud|last3=Rebentrost|first3=Patrick|bibcode=2014NatPh..10..631L|arxiv=1307.0401|citeseerx=10.1.1.746.480}}&lt;/ref&gt; For reference, any known classical algorithm for [[matrix inversion]] requires a number of operations that grows [[Computational complexity of mathematical operations#Matrix algebra|at least quadratically in the dimension of the matrix]].

Quantum matrix inversion can be applied to machine learning methods in which the training reduces to solving a [[System of linear equations|linear system of equations]], for example in least-squares linear regression,&lt;ref name="Nathan Wiebe 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maria Schuld 2016" /&gt; the least-squares version of [[support vector machine]]s,&lt;ref name="Patrick Rebentrost 2014" /&gt; and Gaussian processes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A crucial bottleneck of methods that simulate linear algebra computations with the amplitudes of quantum states is state preparation, which often requires one to initialise a quantum system in a state whose amplitudes reflect the features of the entire dataset. Although efficient methods for state preparation are known for specific cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012307|title=Efficient state preparation for a register of quantum bits|journal=Physical Review A|volume=73|issue=1|pages=012307|year=2006|last1=Soklakov|first1=Andrei N.|last2=Schack|first2=Rüdiger|bibcode=2006PhRvA..73a2307S|arxiv=quant-ph/0408045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.160501|pmid=18518173|title=Quantum Random Access Memory|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=100|issue=16|pages=160501|year=2008|last1=Giovannetti|first1=Vittorio|last2=Lloyd|first2=Seth|last3=MacCone|first3=Lorenzo|bibcode=2008PhRvL.100p0501G|arxiv=0708.1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; this step easily hides the complexity of the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nphys3272|title=Read the fine print|journal=Nature Physics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=291–293|year=2015|last1=Aaronson|first1=Scott|bibcode=2015NatPh..11..291A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum machine learning algorithms based on Grover search===

Another approach to improving classical machine learning with quantum information processing uses [[amplitude amplification]] methods based on [[Grover's algorithm|Grover's search]] algorithm, which has been shown to solve unstructured search problems with a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms. These quantum routines can be employed for learning algorithms that translate into an unstructured search task, as can be done, for instance, in the case of the [[K-medians clustering|k-medians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aïmeur|first=Esma|last2=Brassard|first2=Gilles|last3=Gambs|first3=Sébastien|date=2013-02-01|title=Quantum speed-up for unsupervised learning|journal=Machine Learning|language=en|volume=90|issue=2|pages=261–287|doi=10.1007/s10994-012-5316-5|issn=0885-6125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[k-nearest neighbour|k-nearest neighbors algorithms]].&lt;ref name="Nathan Wiebe 2014" /&gt; Another application is a quadratic speedup in the training of [[perceptrons|perceptron]].&lt;ref name=wiebe2016nips&gt;{{cite conference |arxiv=1602.04799|last1=Wiebe|first1=Nathan|title=Quantum Perceptron Models|last2=Kapoor|first2=Ashish|last3=Svore|first3=Krysta M.|conference=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems|volume=29||pages=3999–4007|url=https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6401-quantum-perceptron-models||bibcode=2016arXiv160204799W|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amplitude amplification is often combined with [[quantum walk]]s to achieve the same quadratic speedup. Quantum walks have been proposed to enhance Google's PageRank algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/srep00444|pmid= 22685626|pmc= 3370332|title= Google in a Quantum Network|journal= Scientific Reports|volume= 2|issue= 444|pages= 444|year= 2012|last1= Paparo|first1= Giuseppe Davide|last2= Martin-Delgado|first2= Miguel Angel|bibcode= 2012NatSR...2E.444P|arxiv= 1112.2079}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the performance of reinforcement learning agents in the projective simulation framework.&lt;ref name=paparo2014quantum&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.4.031002|title=Quantum Speedup for Active Learning Agents|journal=Physical Review X|volume=4|issue=3|pages=031002|year=2014|last1=Paparo|first1=Giuseppe Davide|last2=Dunjko|first2=Vedran|last3=Makmal|first3=Adi|last4=Martin-Delgado|first4=Miguel Angel|last5=Briegel|first5=Hans J.|bibcode=2014PhRvX...4c1002P|arxiv=1401.4997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum sampling techniques===

Sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions is at the core of a wide spectrum of computational techniques with important applications across science, engineering, and society. Examples include [[deep learning]], [[probabilistic programming]], and other machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

A computationally hard problem, which is key for some relevant machine learning tasks, is the estimation of averages over probabilistic models defined in terms of a [[Boltzmann distribution]]. Sampling from generic probabilistic models is hard: algorithms relying heavily on sampling are expected to remain intractable no matter how large and powerful classical computing resources become. Even though [[quantum annealing|quantum annealers]], like those produced by D-Wave Systems, were designed for challenging combinatorial optimization problems, it has been recently recognized as a potential candidate to speed up computations that rely on sampling by exploiting quantum effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Biswas |first1=Rupak |last2=Jiang |first2=Zhang |last3=Kechezi |first3=Kostya |last4=Knysh |first4=Sergey |last5=Mandrà |first5=Salvatore |last6=O’Gorman |first6=Bryan |last7=Perdomo-Ortiz |first7=Alejando |last8=Pethukov |first8=Andre |last9=Realpe-Gómez |first9=John |last10=Rieffel |first10=Eleanor|author1-link= Eleanor Rieffel |last11=Venturelli|first11=Davide|last12=Vasko|first12=Fedir|last13=Wang|first13=Zhihui |title=A NASA perspective on quantum computing: Opportunities and challenges |year=2016|doi=10.1016/j.parco.2016.11.002|journal=Parallel Computing|volume=64 |pages=81–98 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility is to rely on a physical process, like quantum annealing, that naturally generates samples from a Boltzmann distribution. The objective is to find the optimal control parameters that best represent the empirical distribution of a given dataset.

The D-Wave 2X system hosted at NASA Ames Research Center has been recently used for the learning of a special class of restricted Boltzmann machines that can serve as a building block for deep learning architectures.&lt;ref name=Benedetti2016b /&gt; Complementary work that appeared roughly simultaneously showed that quantum annealing can be used for supervised learning in classification tasks.&lt;ref name=Adachi2015 /&gt; The same device was later used to train a fully connected Boltzmann machine to generate, reconstruct, and classify down-scaled, low-resolution handwritten digits, among other synthetic datasets.&lt;ref name=Benedetti2016a /&gt; In both cases, the models trained by quantum annealing had a similar or better performance in terms of quality. The ultimate question that drives this endeavour is whether there is quantum speedup in sampling applications. Experience with the use of quantum annealers for combinatorial optimization suggests the answer is not straightforward.

Inspired by the success of Boltzmann machines based on classical Boltzmann distribution, a new machine learning approach based on quantum Boltzmann distribution of a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian was recently proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Amin |first1=Mohammad H. |last2=Andriyash |first2=Evgeny |last3=Rolfe |first3=Jason |last4=Kulchytskyy |first4=Bohdan |last5=Melko |first5=Roger |date=2016 |title=Quantum Boltzmann machines |journal=Phys.

This problem was, to some extent, circumvented by introducing bounds on the quantum probabilities, allowing the authors to train the model efficiently by sampling. It is possible that a specific type of quantum Boltzmann machine has been trained in the D-Wave 2X by using a learning rule analogous to that of classical Boltzmann machines.&lt;ref name=Benedetti2016a /&gt;&lt;ref name="William G 1611"/&gt;

[[Quantum annealing]] is not the only technology for sampling. In a prepare-and-measure scenario, a universal quantum computer prepares a thermal state, which is then sampled by measurements. This can reduce the time required to train a deep restricted Boltzmann machine, and provide a richer and more comprehensive framework for deep learning than classical computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Wiebe |first1=Nathan |last2=Kapoor |first2=Ashish |last3=Svore |first3=Krysta M. |date=2014 |title=Quantum deep learning |eprint=1412.3489 |class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same quantum methods also permit efficient training of full Boltzmann machines and multi-layer, fully connected models and do not have well-known classical counterparts. Relying on an efficient thermal state preparation protocol starting from an arbitrary state, quantum-enhanced [[Markov logic network]]s exploit the symmetries and the locality structure of the [[Graphical model|probabilistic graphical model]] generated by a [[first-order logic]] template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wittek |first1=Peter |last2=Gogolin |first2=Christian |date=2017 |title=Quantum Enhanced Inference in Markov Logic Networks |journal=Scientific Reports|doi=10.1038/srep45672|pmid=28422093 |pmc=5395824 |volume=7|issue=45672 |page=45672 |arxiv=1611.08104|bibcode=2017NatSR...745672W}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides an exponential reduction in computational complexity in probabilistic inference, and, while the protocol relies on a universal quantum computer, under mild assumptions it can be embedded on contemporary quantum annealing hardware.

Recent work has shown that these models can be successfully learned by maximizing the log-likelihood of the given data via classical optimization, and there is some empirical evidence that these models can better model sequential data compared to classical HMMs in practice, although further work is needed to determine exactly when and how these benefits are derived.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, since classical HMMs are a particular kind of [[Bayesian network|Bayes net]], an exciting aspect of HQMMs is that the techniques used show how we can perform quantum-analogous [[Bayesian inference]], which should allow for the general construction of the quantum versions of [[Graphical model|probabilistic graphical models]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Fully quantum machine learning===
In the most general case of quantum machine learning, both the learning device and the system under study, as well as their interaction, are fully quantum. This section gives a few examples of results on this topic.

One class of problem that can benefit from the fully quantum approach is that of 'learning' unknown quantum states, processes or measurements, in the sense that one can subsequently reproduce them on another quantum system. For example, one may wish to learn a measurement that discriminates between two coherent states, given not a classical description of the states to be discriminated, but instead a set of example quantum systems prepared in these states. The naive approach would be to first extract a classical description of the states and then implement an ideal discriminating measurement based on this information. This would only require classical learning. However, one can show that a fully quantum approach is strictly superior in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sentís|first1=Gael|last2=Guţă|first2=Mădălin|last3=Adesso|first3=Gerardo|date=9 July 2015|title=Quantum learning of coherent states|journal=EPJ Quantum Technology|volume=2|issue=1|doi=10.1140/epjqt/s40507-015-0030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This also relates to work on quantum pattern matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sasaki|first1=Masahide|last2=Carlini|first2=Alberto|date=6 August 2002|title=Quantum learning and universal quantum matching machine|journal=Physical Review A|volume=66|issue=2|pages=022303|arxiv=quant-ph/0202173|bibcode=2002PhRvA..66b2303S|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.66.022303}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The problem of learning unitary transformations can be approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bisio|first1=Alessandro|last2=Chiribella|first2=Giulio|last3=D’Ariano|first3=Giacomo Mauro|last4=Facchini|first4=Stefano|last5=Perinotti|first5=Paolo|date=25 March 2010|title=Optimal quantum learning of a unitary transformation|journal=Physical Review A|volume=81|issue=3|pages=032324|arxiv=0903.0543|bibcode=2010PhRvA..81c2324B|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.81.032324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Going beyond the specific problem of learning states and transformations, the task of [[quantum clustering|clustering]] also admits a fully quantum version, wherein both the oracle which returns the distance between data-points and the information processing device which runs the algorithm are quantum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantum Clustering Algorithms|last1=Aïmeur|first1=Esma|last2=Brassard|first2=Gilles|last3=Gambs|first3=Sébastien|date=1 January 2007|journal=Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Machine Learning|isbn=9781595937933|pages=1–8|citeseerx=10.1.1.80.9513|doi=10.1145/1273496.1273497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a general framework spanning supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning in the fully quantum setting was introduced in,&lt;ref name="DunjkoTaylorBriegel" /&gt; where it was also shown that the possibility of probing the environment in superpositions permits a quantum speedup in reinforcement learning.

==Classical learning applied to quantum systems==
The term quantum machine learning is also used for approaches that apply classical methods of machine learning to the study of quantum systems. A prime example is the use of classical learning techniques to process large amounts of experimental data in order to characterize an unknown quantum system (for instance in the context of [[Quantum information |quantum information theory]] and for the development of quantum technologies), but there are also more exotic applications.

The ability to experimentally control and prepare increasingly complex quantum systems brings with it a growing need to turn large and noisy data sets into meaningful information. This is a problem that has already been studied extensively in the classical setting, and consequently, many existing machine learning techniques can be naturally adapted to more efficiently address experimentally relevant problems. For example, [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] methods and concepts of [[Algorithmic learning theory|algorithmic learning]] can be fruitfully applied to tackle quantum state classification,&lt;ref name="sentis2012quantum"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sentís|first1=Gael|last2=Calsamiglia|first2=John|last3=Muñoz-Tapia|first3=Raúl|last4=Bagan|first4=Emilio|year=2012|title=Quantum learning without quantum memory|url=|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=2|issue=|page=708|arxiv=1106.2742|bibcode=2012NatSR...2E.708S|doi=10.1038/srep00708|pmc=3464493|pmid=23050092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamiltonian learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiebe|first1=Nathan|last2=Granade|first2=Christopher|last3=Ferrie|first3=Christopher|last4=Cory|first4=David|year=2014|title=Quantum Hamiltonian learning using imperfect quantum resources|url=|journal=Physical Review A|volume=89|issue=4|page=042314|arxiv=1311.5269|bibcode=2014PhRvA..89d2314W|doi=10.1103/physreva.89.042314|hdl=10453/118943}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the characterization of an unknown [[Unitary matrix|unitary transformation]].&lt;ref name="bisio2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bisio|first1=Alessandro|last2=Chiribella|first2=Giulio|last3=D'Ariano|first3=Giacomo Mauro|last4=Facchini|first4=Stefano|last5=Perinotti|first5=Paolo|year=2010|title=Optimal quantum learning of a unitary transformation|journal=Physical Review A|volume=81|issue=3|pages=032324|arxiv=0903.0543|bibcode=2010PhRvA..81c2324B|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.81.032324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jeongho|first1=|last2=Junghee Ryu|first2=Bang|last3=Yoo|first3=Seokwon|last4=Pawłowski|first4=Marcin|last5=Lee|first5=Jinhyoung|year=2014|title=A strategy for quantum algorithm design assisted by machine learning|url=|journal=New Journal of Physics|volume=16|issue=1|page=073017|arxiv=1304.2169|bibcode=2014NJPh...16a3017K|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/16/1/013017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other problems that have been addressed with this approach are given in the following list:

==Quantum learning theory==

Quantum learning theory pursues a mathematical analysis of the quantum generalizations of classical learning models and of the possible speed-ups or other improvements that they may provide. The framework is very similar to that of classical [[computational learning theory]], but the learner in this case is a quantum information processing device, while the data may be either classical or quantum. Quantum learning theory should be contrasted with the quantum-enhanced machine learning discussed above, where the goal was to consider ''specific problems'' and to use quantum protocols to improve the time complexity of classical algorithms for these problems. Although quantum learning theory is still under development, partial results in this direction have been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|class=quant-ph|first2=Ronald|last2=de Wolf|title=A Survey of Quantum Learning Theory|date=2017|last1=Arunachalam|first1=Srinivasan|eprint=1701.06806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point in learning theory is typically a ''concept class'', a set of possible concepts. Usually a concept is a function on some domain, such as &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the concept class could be the set of [[Disjunctive normal form|disjunctive normal form (DNF)]] formulas on ''n'' bits or the set of Boolean circuits of some constant depth. The goal for the learner is to learn
(exactly or approximately) an unknown ''target concept'' from this concept class. The learner may be actively interacting with the target concept, or passively receiving samples from it.

In active learning, a learner can make ''membership queries'' to the target concept ''c'', asking for its value ''c(x)'' on inputs ''x'' chosen by the learner. The learner then has to reconstruct the exact target concept, with high probability. In the model of ''quantum exact learning'', the learner can make membership queries in quantum superposition. If the complexity of the learner is measured by the number of membership queries it makes, then quantum exact learners can be polynomially more efficient than classical learners for some concept classes, but not more.&lt;ref name="gortlerservedioquantum"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gortler|first2=Steven J.|year=2004|title=Equivalences and Separations Between Quantum and Classical Learnability|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|volume=33|issue=5|pages=1067–1092|doi=10.1137/S0097539704412910|last1=Servedio|first1=Rocco A.|citeseerx=10.1.1.69.6555}}&lt;/ref&gt; If complexity is measured by the amount of ''time''
the learner uses, then there are concept classes that can be learned efficiently by
quantum learners but not by classical learners (under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions).&lt;ref name="gortlerservedioquantum" /&gt;

A natural model of passive learning is Valiant's [[probably approximately correct learning|probably approximately correct (PAC) learning]]. Here the learner receives random examples ''(x,c(x))'', where ''x'' is distributed according to some unknown distribution ''D''. The learner's goal is to output a hypothesis function ''h'' such that ''h(x)=c(x)'' with high probability when ''x'' is drawn according to ''D''. The learner has to be able to produce such an 'approximately correct' ''h'' for every ''D'' and every target concept ''c'' in its concept class.
We can consider replacing the random examples by potentially more powerful quantum examples &lt;math&gt;\sum_x \sqrt{D(x)}|x,c(x)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. In the PAC model (and the related agnostic model), this doesn't significantly reduce the number of examples needed: for every concept class, classical and
quantum sample complexity are the same up to constant factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|class=quant-ph|first2=Ronald|last2=de Wolf|title=Optimal Quantum Sample Complexity of Learning Algorithms|date=2016|last1=Arunachalam|first1=Srinivasan|eprint=1607.00932}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for learning under some
fixed distribution ''D'', quantum examples can be very helpful, for example for learning DNF under
the uniform distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jeffrey|first2=Jackson C.|year=1999|title=Learning DNF over the Uniform Distribution Using a Quantum Example Oracle|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|volume=28|issue=3|pages=1136–1153|doi=10.1137/S0097539795293123|last1=Nader|first1=Bshouty H.|citeseerx=10.1.1.23.5709}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering ''time'' complexity, there exist concept classes that can be PAC-learned efficiently by quantum learners, even from classical examples, but not by classical learners (again, under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions).&lt;ref name="gortlerservedioquantum" /&gt;

This passive learning type is also the most common scheme in supervised learning: a learning algorithm typically takes the training examples fixed, without the ability to query the label of unlabelled examples. Outputting a hypothesis ''h'' is a step of induction. Classically, an inductive model splits into a training and an application phase: the model parameters are estimated in the training phase, and the learned model is applied an arbitrary many times in the application phase. In the asymptotic limit of the number of applications, this splitting of phases is also present with quantum resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first2=Gael|last2=Sentís|title=Inductive supervised quantum learning|year=2017|last1=Monràs|first1=Alex|last3=Wittek|first3=Peter|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=118|issue=19|pages=190503|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.190503 |pmid=28548536|bibcode=2017PhRvL.118s0503M|arxiv=1605.07541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations and experiments==

The earliest experiments were conducted using the adiabatic [[D-Wave Systems|D-Wave]] quantum computer, for instance, to detect cars in digital images using regularized boosting with a nonconvex objective function in a demonstration in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/de//googleblogs/pdfs/nips_demoreport_120709_research.pdf|title=NIPS 2009 Demonstration: Binary Classification using Hardware Implementation of Quantum Annealing|publisher=Static.googleusercontent.com|format=PDF|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many experiments followed on the same architecture, and leading tech companies have shown interest in the potential of quantum machine learning for future technological implementations. In 2013, Google Research, [[NASA]], and the [[Universities Space Research Association]] launched the [[Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab]] which explores the use of the adiabatic D-Wave quantum computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/+QuantumAILab|title=Google Quantum A.I. Lab Team|date=31 January 2017|website=Google Plus|access-date=31 January 2017|quote=|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/physics/quail/|title=NASA Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|date=31 January 2017|website=NASA|publisher=NASA|access-date=31 January 2017|quote=|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent example trained a probabilistic generative models with arbitrary pairwise connectivity, showing that their model is capable of generating handwritten digits as well as reconstructing noisy images of bars and stripes and handwritten digits.&lt;ref name="Benedetti2016a" /&gt;

Using a different annealing technology based on [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), a quantum [[Hopfield network]] was implemented in 2009 that mapped the input data and memorized data to Hamiltonians, allowing the use of adiabatic quantum computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Neves|first2=Jorge L.|last3=Sollacher|first3=Rudolf|last4=Glaser|first4=Steffen J.|year=2009|title=Quantum pattern recognition with liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance|journal=Physical Review A|volume=79|issue=4|pages=042321|arxiv=0802.1592|bibcode=2009PhRvA..79d2321N|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.79.042321|last1=Neigovzen|first1=Rodion}}&lt;/ref&gt; NMR technology also enables universal quantum computing{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}, and it was used for the first experimental implementation of a quantum support vector machine to distinguish hand written number ‘6’ and ‘9’ on a liquid-state  quantum computer in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Liu|first2=Xiaomei|last3=Xu|first3=Nanyang|last4=Du|first4=Jiangfeng|year=2015|title=Experimental Realization of a Quantum Support Vector Machine|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=114|issue=14|pages=140504|arxiv=1410.1054|bibcode=2015PhRvL.114n0504L|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.140504|pmid=25910101|last1=Li|first1=Zhaokai}}&lt;/ref&gt; The training data involved the pre-processing of the image which maps them to normalized 2-dimensional vectors to represent the images as the states of a qubit. The two entries of the vector are the vertical and horizontal ratio of the pixel intensity of the image. Once the vectors are defined on the feature space, the quantum support vector machine was implemented to classify the unknown input vector. The readout avoids costly [[quantum tomography]] by reading out the final state in terms of direction (up/down) of the NMR signal.

Photonic implementations are attracting more attention,&lt;ref name="WanDKGK16" /&gt; not the least because they do not require extensive cooling. Simultaneous spoken digit and speaker recognition and chaotic time-series prediction were demonstrated at data rates beyond 1 gigabyte per second in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Soriano|first2=Miguel C.|last3=Mirasso|first3=Claudio R.|last4=Fischer|first4=Ingo|year=2013|title=Parallel photonic information processing at gigabyte per second data rates using transient states|journal=Nature Communications|volume=4|pages=1364|bibcode=2013NatCo...4E1364B|doi=10.1038/ncomms2368|pmc=3562454|pmid=23322052|last1=Brunner|first1=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using non-linear photonics to implement an all-optical linear classifier, a perceptron model was capable of learning the classification boundary iteratively from training data through a feedback rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Mabuchi|first2=Hideo|year=2015|title=A coherent perceptron for all-optical learning|journal=EPJ Quantum Technology|volume=2|arxiv=1501.01608|doi=10.1140/epjqt/s40507-015-0023-3|last1=Tezak|first1=Nikolas}}&lt;/ref&gt; A core building block in many learning algorithms is to calculate the distance between two vectors: this was first experimentally demonstrated for up to eight dimensions using entangled qubits in a photonic quantum computer in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wu|first2=D.|last3=Su|first3=Z.-E.|last4=Chen|first4=M.-C.|last5=Wang|first5=X.-L.|last6=Li|first6=Li|last7=Liu|first7=N.-L.|last8=Lu|first8=C.-Y.|last9=Pan|first9=J.-W.|year=2015|title=Entanglement-Based Machine Learning on a Quantum Computer|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=114|issue=11|pages=110504|arxiv=1409.7770|bibcode=2015PhRvL.114k0504C|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.110504|pmid=25839250|last1=Cai|first1=X.-D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, based on a neuromimetic approach, a novel ingredient has been added to the field of quantum machine learning, in the form of a so-called quantum memristor, a quantized model of the standard classical [[memristor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep29507 |pmid=27381511 |pmc=4933948 |title=Quantum memristors |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=6 |issue=2016 |pages=29507 |year=2016|last1=Pfeiffer |first1=P. |last2=Egusquiza |first2=I.

An implementation of a quantum memristor in superconducting circuits has been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep42044|pmid= 28195193|pmc= 5307327|last1= Salmilehto|first1= J.|title= Quantum Memristors with Superconducting Circuits|last2=  Deppe|first2= F.|last3=  Di Ventra|first3= M.|last4=  Sanz|first4= M.|last5=  Solano|first5= E.|journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue= 42044|pages=42044|year= 2017|arxiv=1603.04487|bibcode=2017NatSR...742044S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an experiment with quantum dots performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1612.08409|last1=Li|first1=Ying|title=A simple and robust quantum memristor|journal=Physical Review B|volume=96|issue=7|pages=075446|last2= Holloway|first2=Gregory W.|last3= Benjamin|first3=Simon C.|last4= Briggs|first4=G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4481">A '''qutrit''' (or '''quantum trit''') is a unit of [[quantum information]] that is realized by a quantum system described by a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of three mutually orthogonal [[quantum states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nisbet-Jones|first=Peter B. R.|last2=Dilley|first2=Jerome|last3=Holleczek|first3=Annemarie|last4=Barter|first4=Oliver|last5=Kuhn|first5=Axel|date=2013|title=Photonic qubits, qutrits and ququads accurately prepared and delivered on demand|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1367-2630/15/i=5/a=053007|journal=New Journal of Physics|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|pages=053007|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/15/5/053007|issn=1367-2630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The qutrit is analogous to the classical base-3 [[trit (computing)|trit]], just as the [[qubit]], a quantum system described by a superposition of two orthogonal states, is analogous to the classical base-2 [[bit]].

==Representation==
A qutrit has three orthonormal [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] states or [[vector space|vector]]s, often denoted &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;|2\rangle&lt;/math&gt; in Dirac or [[bra–ket notation]].
These are used to describe the qutrit as a [[Superposition principle|superposition]] state vector in the form of a linear combination of the three orthonormal basis states:
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle + \gamma |2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
where the coefficients are complex [[probability amplitude]]s, such that the sum of their squares is unity (normalization):
: &lt;math&gt;| \alpha |^2 + | \beta |^2 + | \gamma |^2 = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[qubit]]'s orthonormal basis states &lt;math&gt;\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; span the two-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to spin-up and spin-down of a spin-1/2 particle. Qutrits require a Hilbert space of higher dimension, namely the three-dimensional &lt;math&gt;H_3&lt;/math&gt; spanned by the qutrit's basis &lt;math&gt;\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle,|2\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;
,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrd|first=Mark|date=1998|title=Differential geometry on SU(3) with applications to three state systems|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.532618|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|language=en|volume=39|issue=11|pages=6125–6136|doi=10.1063/1.532618|issn=0022-2488|via=|arxiv=math-ph/9807032}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be realized by a three-level quantum system.  Note, however, that not all three-level quantum systems are qutrits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/342903/quantum-systems-three-level-vs-qutrit|title=Quantum systems: three-level vs qutrit|website=Physics Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A string of ''n'' qutrits represents 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; different states simultaneously, i.e., a superposition state vector in 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-dimensional complex Hilbert space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caves|first=Carlton M.|last2=Milburn|first2=Gerard J.|date=2000|title=Qutrit entanglement|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0030-4018(99)00693-8|journal=Optics Communications|volume=179|issue=1-6|pages=439–446|doi=10.1016/s0030-4018(99)00693-8|issn=0030-4018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qutrits have several peculiar features when used for storing quantum information. For example, they are more robust to [[decoherence]] under certain environmental interactions.&lt;ref&gt;A.

[[File:T_Mendes.jpeg|thumb|left|Bust of T. Mendes in Rio de Janeiro city]]

'''Raimundo Teixeira Mendes''' (5 January 1855 &amp;ndash; 1927) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]].  He is credited with creating the national [[motto]], "Order and Progress", as well as [[Flag of Brazil|the national flag]] on which it appears.

Teixeira Mendes was born in [[Caxias, Maranhão]].

== Comtean Positivism ==
Teixeira Mendes was heavily influenced by [[Comtism]] and is classed as a "Humanity Apostle" by Brazil's [[Religion of Humanity]], which is called "Igreja Positivista do Brasil" or in English "Positivist Church of Brazil."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igrejapositivistabrasil.org.br/english/igreja.html Positivist Church of Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt; In life he led the Positivist Church after 1903. For him the Positivist viewpoint meant he opposed most wars and believed in the eventual disappearance of nations. He also opposed Christian missionary work toward the indigenous Brazilians and instead favored a policy based on protection and gradual assimilation. He deemed their societies "fetishistic", but believed a gradual non-coercive assimilation was the way to turn them into Positivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Robert Calderbank''' (born 28 December 1954) is a professor of [[Computer Science]], [[Electrical Engineering]], and [[Mathematics]] and director of the Information Initiative at [[Duke University|Duke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.duke.edu/2013/03/calderbankiid |title=Calderbank to Direct Interdisciplinary 'Big Data' Effort at Duke}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He received a [[BSc]] from [[University of Warwick|Warwick University]] in 1975, an [[MSc]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1976, and a PhD from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], all in mathematics. He joined [[Bell Labs]] in 1980, and retired from [[AT&amp;T Labs]] in 2003 as Vice President for Research and [[Internet]] and [[computer network|network]] systems. He then went to [[Princeton University|Princeton]] as a professor of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and [[Applied mathematics|Applied and Computational Mathematics]], before moving to Duke in 2010 to become Dean of Natural Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.duke.edu/2010/05/calderbank.html |title=Duke Names Princeton Professor Dean of Natural Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Iterated function}} {{main|Infinite compositions of analytic functions}}
In mathematics, '''superfunction''' is a nonstandard name for an [[iterated function]] for complexified continuous iteration index. 
Roughly, for some function ''f''  and for some variable ''x'', the superfunction could be defined by the  expression
:&lt;math&gt; S(z;x) =  
\underbrace{f\Big(f\big(\dots f(x)\dots\big)\Big)}_{z \text{ evaluations of the function }f} .&lt;/math&gt;
Then, ''S(z;x)''  can be interpreted as the superfunction of the function ''f(x)''.
Such a definition is valid only for a positive integer index ''z''. The variable ''x'' is often omitted. 
Much  study and many applications of  superfunctions  employ various ''extensions of these superfunctions to complex and continuous indices''; and the analysis of the existence, uniqueness and their evaluation. The [[Ackermann function]]s and [[tetration]] can be interpreted in terms of super-functions.

==History==
Analysis of superfunctions arose from applications of the evaluation of fractional iterations of functions. Superfunctions and their inverses allow evaluation of not only the first negative power of a function (inverse function), but also of any real and even complex iterate of that function. Historically, an early  function of this  kind considered was &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\exp}~&lt;/math&gt;; the  function &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{!~}~&lt;/math&gt; has then been used as the logo of the Physics department of the [[Moscow State University]].

At that time, these investigators did not have computational access for the evaluation of such functions, but the function &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\exp}&lt;/math&gt; was luckier than &lt;math&gt;~\sqrt{!~}~~&lt;/math&gt;: at the very least, the existence of the [[holomorphic function]]
&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(\varphi(u))=\exp(u)&lt;/math&gt; had been demonstrated in 1950 by [[Hellmuth Kneser]].&lt;ref name="kneser"&gt;

|year=1950
|pages=56–67}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Relying on the elegant functional conjugacy theory of [[Schröder's equation]],&lt;ref name="schr"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schröder |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Schröder |coauthors= |year=1870 |month= |title=Ueber iterirte Functionen|journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |volume=3 |issue= |pages=296&amp;ndash;322 | doi=10.1007/BF01443992   |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his proof, Kneser had constructed the "superfunction" of the exponential map through the corresponding ''Abel function'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying the related [[Abel equation]]
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}(\exp(u))=\mathcal{X}(u)+1.\ &lt;/math&gt;
so that  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}(S(z;u))=\mathcal{X}(u)+z\ &lt;/math&gt;. The inverse function Kneser found,  
:&lt;math&gt;S(z;u)=\mathcal{X}^{-1}(z+\mathcal{X}(u))&lt;/math&gt; 
is an [[entire function|entire]] super-exponential, although it is not real on the real axis; it cannot be interpreted as [[tetration]]al, because the condition &lt;math&gt;S(0;x)=x&lt;/math&gt; cannot be realized for the entire super-exponential. The [[real function|real]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\exp}&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed with the [[tetration]]al (which is also a superexponential); while the real &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{!~}~&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed with the [[superfactorial]].

==Extensions==
The recurrence formula of the above preamble can be written as  
:&lt;math&gt;S(z + 1;x)=f(S(z;x)) ~~~~~~~~ \forall z\in \mathbb{N} : z&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(1)=f(x).&lt;/math&gt;
Instead of the last equation, one could write the identity function,
:&lt;math&gt;S(0)=x~,&lt;/math&gt;
and extend the range of definition of the superfunction ''S''  to the non-negative integers.  Then, one may posit
:&lt;math&gt;S(-1)=f^{-1}(x), &lt;/math&gt;
and extend the range of validity to the integer values larger than −2.

The following extension, for example,

:&lt;math&gt;S(-2)=f^{-2}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

is not trivial, because the inverse function may happen to be not defined for some values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
In particular, [[tetration]] can be interpreted as super-function of exponential for some real base &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;; in this case,
:&lt;math&gt;f=\exp_{b}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then, at ''x''=1,
:&lt;math&gt;S(-1) = \log_b 1 = 0, &lt;/math&gt;
but
:&lt;math&gt;S(-2) = \log_b 0 &lt;/math&gt;
is not defined.

For extension to non-integer values of the argument, the superfunction should be defined in a different way.

For complex numbers &lt;math&gt;~a~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~b~&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;~a~&lt;/math&gt; belongs to some connected domain &lt;math&gt;D\subseteq \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;,
the superfunction (from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) of a [[holomorphic function]] ''f''   on the  domain &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is
function &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;, [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on domain &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, such that
:&lt;math&gt;S(z\!+\!1)=f(S(z)) ~ \forall z\in D : z\!+\!1 \in D\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(a)=b.\ &lt;/math&gt;

==Uniqueness==
In general, the superfunction is not unique.
For a given base function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, from a given &lt;math&gt;(a\mapsto d)&lt;/math&gt; superfunction &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, another &lt;math&gt;(a\mapsto d)&lt;/math&gt;  superfunction &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; could be constructed as
: &lt;math&gt;G(z)=S(z+\mu(z))\ &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is any 1-periodic function, holomorphic at least in some vicinity of the real axis, such that &lt;math&gt; \mu(a)=0 &lt;/math&gt;.

The modified super-function may have a narrower range of holomorphy.
The variety of possible super-functions is especially large in the limiting case, when the width of the range of holomorphy becomes zero; in this case, one deals with  real-analytic superfunctions.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;
{{cite journal

|journal= [[Mathematics of Computation]]
|volume=196
|year=1991
|pages=723–733
|jstor=2938713
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

If the range of holomorphy required is large enough, then, the super-function is expected to be unique,
at least in some specific base functions &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the &lt;math&gt;(C, 0\mapsto 1)&lt;/math&gt; super-function of
&lt;math&gt;\exp_b&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;b&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, is called [[tetration]] and is believed to be unique, at least for
&lt;math&gt;C= \{  z \in  \mathbb{C}  ~:~\Re(z)&gt;-2 \}&lt;/math&gt;; for the case &lt;math&gt; b&gt;\exp(1/\mathrm{e})&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="kouznetsov"&gt;

}} preprint: [http://www.ils.uec.ac.jp/~dima/PAPERS/analuxp99.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;
but up to 2009, the uniqueness was more [[conjecture]] than a theorem with a formal mathematical proof.

==Examples==
This short collection of elementary superfunctions is illustrated in.&lt;ref name="superfactorial"&gt;
 D.Kouznetsov, H.Trappmann. Superfunctions and square root of factorial. [[Moscow University Physics Bulletin]], 2010, v.65, No.1, p.6-12. (Preprint ILS UEC, 2009:
[http://www.ils.uec.ac.jp/~dima/PAPERS/2009supefae.pdf] )
&lt;/ref&gt;  Some superfunctions can be expressed through elementary functions;
they are used without  mention that they are superfunctions.
For example, for the transfer function "++", which means unity increment,
the superfunction is just addition of a constant.

===Addition===
Chose a [[complex number]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and define the function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{add}_c&lt;/math&gt; as 
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{add}_c(x)=c +x, ~~~ ~ \forall x \in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Further define the function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{mul_c}&lt;/math&gt; as
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{mul_c}(x)=c\cdot x,~~~ ~ \forall x \in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, the function &lt;math&gt;S(z;x)=x+\mathrm{mul_c}(z)&lt;/math&gt; is  the superfunction  (0 to ''c'')
of the function  &lt;math&gt;~\mathrm{add_c}~&lt;/math&gt; on '''''C'''''.

===Multiplication===
Exponentiation &lt;math&gt;\exp_c&lt;/math&gt; is superfunction (from 1 to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;) of function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{mul}_c &lt;/math&gt;.

===Quadratic polynomials===
The examples but the last one, below, are essentially from  Schröder's pioneering 1870 paper.&lt;ref name="schr"/&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=2 x^2-1&lt;/math&gt;.
Then,
::&lt;math&gt;S(z;x)=\cos( 2^z \arccos (x)) &lt;/math&gt;
is a &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{C},~ 0\! \rightarrow\! 1)&lt;/math&gt; superfunction  (iteration orbit) of ''f''.

Indeed,
:&lt;math&gt; S(z+1;x)=\cos(2 \cdot 2^z  \arccos (x)     )=2\cos( 2^z \arccos (x))^2 -1 =f(S(z;x))\ &lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;S(0;x)=x ~.\ &lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the superfunction &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is periodic, with period
&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{2\pi}{\ln(2)} i\approx 9.0647202836543876194 \!~i &lt;/math&gt;;
and the superfunction approaches unity  in the negative direction of the real axis,
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\rightarrow -\infty} S(z)=1.\ &lt;/math&gt;

===Algebraic function===
Similarly,
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=2x \sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
has an iteration orbit
:&lt;math&gt;S(z;x)=\sin( 2^z\arcsin (x)).&lt;/math&gt;

===Rational function===
In general, the transfer (step) function ''f(x)'' needs not   be an [[entire function]]. An example involving a   [[meromorphic function]] ''f'' reads,
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{2x}{1-x^2} ~~~~~ \forall x\in D~&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;~ D=\mathbb{C} \backslash  \{-1,1\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Its iteration orbit (superfunction) is  
:&lt;math&gt; S(z;x)=\tan( 2^z \arctan(x))&lt;/math&gt;
on '''''C''''', the set of complex numbers except for the singularities of the function ''S''.
To see this, recall the double angle  trigonometric formula
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(2 \alpha)=\frac{2 \tan(\alpha)}{1-\tan(\alpha)^2}~~
\forall \alpha \in \mathbb{C} \backslash  \{\alpha\in \mathbb{C} : \cos(\alpha)=0 || \sin(\alpha)=\pm \cos(\alpha)  \}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Exponentiation===
Let
&lt;math&gt;b&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;f(u)= \exp_b(u)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt; C= \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \Re(u)&gt;-2 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
The [[tetration]]  &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{tet}_b &lt;/math&gt; is then a &lt;math&gt;(C,~ 0\! \rightarrow\! 1)&lt;/math&gt; superfunction of &lt;math&gt;\exp_b&lt;/math&gt;.

==Abel function==
{{main|Abel equation}}
The inverse of a superfunction for a suitable argument ''x'' can be interpreted as the [[Abel function]], the solution of the  [[Abel equation]],
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}(\exp(u))=\mathcal{X}(u)+1.\ &lt;/math&gt;
and hence 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}(S(z;u))=\mathcal{X}(u)+z.\ &lt;/math&gt;
The inverse function when defined, is 
:&lt;math&gt;S(z;u)=\mathcal{X}^{-1}(z+\mathcal{X}(u)),&lt;/math&gt; 
for suitable domains and ranges, when they exist. The recursive property of ''S'' is then self-evident.
 
The figure at left shows an example of transition from
&lt;math&gt;\exp^{1}\!=\!\exp &lt;/math&gt; to
&lt;math&gt;\exp^{\!-1}\!=\!\ln &lt;/math&gt;.
The iterated function &lt;math&gt;\exp^z&lt;/math&gt; versus real argument is plotted for
&lt;math&gt;z=2,1,0.9, 0.5, 0.1, -0.1,-0.5, -0.9, -1,-2&lt;/math&gt;. The [[tetration]]al and ArcTetrational were used as superfunction
&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and Abel function &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of the exponential.
The figure at right shows these functions in the complex plane.
At non-negative integer number of iteration, the iterated exponential is an [[entire function]]; at non-integer values, it has two [[branch points]], thich correspond to the [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; of natural logarithm. At &lt;math&gt;z\!\ge\! 0&lt;/math&gt;, function &lt;math&gt;\exp^z ~(x)&lt;/math&gt; remains [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] at least in the strip &lt;math&gt;|\Im(z)|&lt;\Im(L)\approx 1.3 &lt;/math&gt; along the real axis.

==Applications of superfunctions and Abel functions==

Superfunctions, usually the [[tetration|superexponential]]s, are proposed as a fast-growing function for an
upgrade of the [[floating point]] representation of numbers in computers. Such an upgrade would greatly extend the
range of huge numbers which are still distinguishable from infinity.

Other applications include  the calculation of fractional iterates (or fractional powers) of a function. Any holomorphic function can be identified to a [[transfer function]], and then its super-functions and corresponding Abel functions can be considered.
;Nonlinear optics:
In the investigation of the nonlinear response of optical materials, the sample is supposed to be optically thin, in such a way, that the intensity of the light does not change much as it goes through.  Then one can consider, for example, the absorption as function of the intensity.  However, at small variation of the intensity in the sample, the precision of measurement of the absorption as function of intensity is not good.  The reconstruction of the superfunction from the transfer function allows to work with relatively thick samples, improving the precision of measurements. In particular, the transfer function of the similar sample, which is half thiner, could be interpreted as the square root (i.e. half-iteration) of the transfer function of the initial sample.

Similar example is suggested for a nonlinear optical fiber.&lt;ref name="kouznetsov"/&gt;

;Nonlinear acoustics:
It may make sense to characterize the nonlinearities in the attenuation of shock waves in a homogeneous tube. This could find an application in some advanced muffler, using nonlinear acoustic effects to withdraw the energy of the sound waves without to disturb the flux of the gas. Again, the analysis of the nonlinear response, i.e. the transfer function, may be boosted with the superfunction.

;Evaporation and condensation:
In analysis of condensation, the growth (or vaporization) of a small drop of liquid can be considered,
as it diffuses down through a tube with some uniform concentration of vapor.
In the first approximation, at fixed concentration of the vapor,
the mass of the drop at the output end can be interpreted as the [[transfer function]] of the input mass.
The square root of this transfer function will characterize the tube of half length.

;Snow avalanche:
The mass of a snowball that rolls down a hill can be considered as a function of the path it has already passed. At fixed length of this path
(that can be determined by the altitude of the hill) this mass can be considered also as a Transfer Function of the input mass. The mass of the snowball could be measured at the top of the hill and at the bottom, giving the Transfer Function; then, the mass of the snowball, as a function of the length it passed, is a superfunction.

;Operational element:
If one needs to build up an operational element with some given transfer function &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;,
and wants to realize it as a sequential connection of a couple of identical operational elements, then, each of these two elements should have transfer function
&lt;math&gt; h=\sqrt{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Such a function can be evaluated through the superfunction and the Abel function of the transfer function &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

The operational element may have any origin: it can be realized as an electronic microchip,
or a mechanical couple of curvilinear grains, or some asymmetric U-tube filled with different liquids, and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5688">In mathematics, the '''supersingular isogeny graphs''' are a class of [[expander graph]]s that arise in [[computational number theory]] and have been applied in [[elliptic-curve cryptography]]. Their vertices represent [[supersingular elliptic curve]]s over [[finite field]]s and their edges represent [[Isogeny|isogenies]] between curves.

==Definition and properties==
A supersingular isogeny graph is determined by choosing a large [[prime number]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and a small prime number &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, and considering the class of all [[supersingular elliptic curve]]s defined over the [[finite field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{p^2}&lt;/math&gt;. There are approximately &lt;math&gt;(p+1)/12&lt;/math&gt; such curves, each two of which can be related by isogenies. The vertices in the supersingular isogeny graph represent these curves (or more concretely, their [[j-invariant|{{mvar|j}}-invariants]], elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{p^2}&lt;/math&gt;) and the edges represent isogenies of degree &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; between two curves.{{r|clg|fjp|m}}

The supersingular isogeny graphs are &lt;math&gt;\ell+1&lt;/math&gt;-[[regular graph]]s, meaning that each vertex has exactly &lt;math&gt;\ell+1&lt;/math&gt; neighbors. They were proven by Pizer to be [[Ramanujan graph]]s, graphs with optimal [[expander graph|expansion properties]] for their degree.{{r|clg|fjp|p1|p2}} The proof is based on [[Pierre Deligne]]'s proof of the [[Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture]].{{r|p1}}

==Cryptographic applications==
One proposal for a [[cryptographic hash function]] involves starting from a fixed vertex of a supersingular isogeny graph, using the bits of the binary representation of an input value to determine a sequence of edges to follow in a walk in the graph, and using the identity of the vertex reached at the end of the walk as the hash value for the input. The security of the proposed hashing scheme rests on the assumption that it is difficult to find paths in this graph that connect arbitrary pairs of vertices.{{r|clg}}

It has also been proposed to use walks in two supersingular isogeny graphs with the same vertex set but different edge sets (defined using different choices of the &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; parameter) to develop a key exchange primitive analogous to [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]], called [[supersingular isogeny key exchange]].{{r|fjp}}

Additional cryptographic methods based on these graphs include signature schemes and public-key cryptography. They have been suggested as a form of [[post-quantum cryptography]]: {{as of|2018}}, there are no known subexponential-time methods for breaking these schemes, even on [[quantum computer]]s.{{r|ehlmp}}

'''''The Emergence of Probability: A Philosophical Study of Early Ideas about Probability, Induction and Statistical Inference''''' is a 1975 book by the philosopher [[Ian Hacking]].

==Reception==
Hacking's work has been described as ground-breaking.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mac05|Macintosh 2005]]. p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The philosopher [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] argued that Hacking's contention that there was no concept of uncertain evidence before about 1650 is incorrect, as it neglects the extensive Latin [[scholasticism|scholastic]] literature on legal [[evidence (law)|evidence]] and [[aleatory contracts]] and on [[inductive reasoning|induction]].&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;[[#Fra01|Franklin 2001]]. p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''UML tool''' or '''UML modeling tool''' is a [[application software|software application]] that supports some or all of the notation and semantics associated with the '''[[Unified Modeling Language]]''' ('''UML'''), which is the industry standard [[general purpose modeling]] language for [[software engineering]].

''UML tool'' is used broadly here to include application programs which are not exclusively focused on UML, but which support some functions of the Unified Modeling Language, either as an ''add-on'', as a ''component'' or as a ''part'' of their overall functionality.

==Kinds of Functionality==
UML tools support the following kinds of functionality:

===Diagramming===
''Diagramming'' in this context means ''creating'' and ''editing'' UML [[diagram]]s; that is diagrams that follow the graphical notation of the Unified Modeling Language.

The use of UML diagrams as a means to draw diagrams of – mostly – [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] software is generally agreed upon by software developers. When developers draw diagrams of object-oriented software, they usually follow the UML notation. On the other hand, it is often debated whether those diagrams are needed at all, during  what stages of the software development process they should be used, and how (if at all) they should be kept up to date. The primacy of software code often leads to the diagrams being deprecated.

===Round-trip engineering===
[[Round-trip engineering]] refers to the ability of a UML tool to perform code generation from models, and model generation from code (a.k.a., reverse engineering), while keeping both the model and the code semantically consistent with each other. Code generation and reverse engineering are explained in more detail below.
====Code generation====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Unified Modeling Language]] --&gt;
''[[Automatic programming|Code generation]]'' in this context means that the user creates UML diagrams, which have some connected model data, and the UML tool derives from the diagrams part or all of the [[source code]] for the software system. In some tools the user can provide a skeleton of the program source code, in the form of a source code [[template (programming)|template]], where predefined tokens are then replaced with program source code parts during the code generation process.

There is some debate among software developers about how useful code generation as such is {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. It certainly depends on the specific problem domain and how far code generation should be applied. There are well known areas where code generation is an established practice, not limited to the field of UML.

The idea of completely leaving the "code level" and starting to do "programming" directly from the UML diagram level (i.e., design level) is quite debated among developers {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. That is the vision for [[Model-driven architecture]] (MDA). This idea is not in such widespread use compared to other [[software development]] tools like [[compiler]]s or [[Configuration management|software configuration management systems]].

An often cited criticism is that the UML diagrams lack the detail that is needed to contain the same information as is covered with the program source:  Jack W. Reeves states that the final embodiment of the design lies in the source code. (His often quoted statement that "the Code ''is'' the design" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html by Jack W. Reeves&lt;/ref&gt; has been misinterpreted to mean that there is no need for intermediate- and high-level software-design artifacts, such as UML diagrams or software-requirements documents).

====Reverse engineering====
''Reverse engineering'' in this context means, that the UML tool reads program source code as input and ''derives'' model data and corresponding graphical UML diagrams from it (as opposed to the somewhat broader meaning described in the article "[[Reverse engineering]]").

Some of the challenges of reverse engineering are:
* The source code often has much more detailed information than one would want to see in design diagrams. This problem is addressed by [[software architecture reconstruction]].
* Diagram data is normally not contained with the program source, such that the UML tool, at least in the initial step, has to create some ''random layout'' of the graphical symbols of the UML notation or use some automatic ''[[layout algorithm]]'' to place the symbols in a way that the user can understand the diagram. For example, the symbols should be placed at such locations on the drawing pane that they don't overlap. Usually, the user of such a functionality of a UML tool has to manually edit those automatically generated diagrams to attain some meaningfulness. It also often doesn't make sense to draw diagrams of the whole program source, as that represents just too much detail to be of interest at the level of the UML diagrams.
* There are language features of some [[programming language]]s, like ''class-'' or ''function templates'' of the [[C++]] programming language, which are notoriously hard to convert automatically to UML diagrams in their full complexity.

===Model and diagram interchange===
[[XML Metadata Interchange]] (XMI) is the format for UML model interchange. XMI does not support [[UML Diagram Interchange]], which allows the importation of UML diagrams from one model to another.

===Model transformation===
A key concept associated with the [[model-driven architecture]] initiative is the capacity to transform a model into another model. For example, one might want to transform a platform-independent domain model into a Java platform-specific model for implementation. It is also possible to refactor UML models to produce more concise and well-formed UML models. It is possible to generate UML models from other modeling notations, such as [[BPMN]], which is itself a [[UML profile]]. The standard that supports this is called [[QVT]] for Queries/Views/Transformations. One example of an open-source [[QVT]]-solution is the [[ATLAS Transformation Language|ATL]] language built by [[INRIA]].

The '''umbilic torus''' or '''umbilic bracelet''' is a single-edged 3-dimensional shape. The lone edge goes three times around the ring before returning to the starting point. The shape also has a single external face. A [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of the surface forms a [[Deltoid curve|deltoid]].

The umbilic torus occurs in the mathematical subject of [[singularity theory]], in particular in the classification of [[umbilical point]]s which are determined by real [[cubic form]]s &lt;math&gt;a x^3 + 3 b x^2 y + 3 c x y^2 + d y^3&lt;/math&gt;. The equivalence classes of such cubics form a three-dimensional real projective space and the subset of parabolic forms define a surface – the umbilic torus. [[Christopher Zeeman]] named this set the umbilic bracelet in 1976.&lt;ref name=port&gt;{{Citation|first=Ian R.|last=Porteous|title=Geometric Differentiation, For the Intelligence of Curves and Surfaces|ISBN=978-0-521-00264-6|pp=350
|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press| edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The torus is defined by the following set of [[parametric equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Roland E., et al. ''Calculus''. Ed. Charles Hartford. 6th ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sin u \left(7+\cos\left({u \over 3} - 2v\right) + 2\cos\left({u \over3} + v\right)\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y = \cos u \left(7 + \cos\left({u \over 3} - 2v\right) + 2\cos\left({u \over 3} + v\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z = \sin\left({u \over 3} - 2v\right) + 2\sin \left({u \over 3} + v\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{for }-\pi \le u \le \pi,\quad -\pi \le v \le \pi &lt;/math&gt;

[[John Robinson (sculptor)|John Robinson]] created a sculpture ''Eternity'' based on the shape in 1989, this had a triangular cross-section rather than a deltoid of a true Umbilic bracelet. This appeared on the cover of Geometric Differentiation by [[Ian R. Porteous]].&lt;ref name="port"/&gt;

[[Helaman Ferguson]] has created a 27-inch (69 centimeters) bronze sculpture, ''Umbilic Torus'', and it is his most widely known piece of art. In 2010, it was announced that [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] had commissioned an Umbilic Torus sculpture to be constructed outside the Math and Physics buildings at [[Stony Brook University]], in proximity to the [[Simons Center for Geometry and Physics]]. The torus is made out of cast bronze, and is mounted on a stainless steel column. The total weight of the sculpture is 65 tonnes, and has a height of {{convert|28|ft|m}}. The torus has a diameter of {{convert|24|ft|m}}, the same diameter as the granite base. Various mathematical formulas defining the torus are inscribed on the base. Installation was completed in September, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Helaman Ferguson, "Two Theorems, Two Sculptures, Two Posters", ''American Mathematical Monthly'', Volume 97, Number 7,August-September 1990, pages 589-610.&lt;/ref&gt;
