      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3538">'''Achmet''', son of Seirim (Gk. '''{{lang|grc|Αχμέτ υιός Σειρείμ}}'''), the author of a work on the interpretation of dreams, the ''[[Oneirocriticon of Achmet]]'', is probably the same person as [[Abu Bekr Mohammed Ben Sirin]], whose work on the same subject is still extant in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the Royal Library at [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;''Catal. Cod. Manuscr, Biblioth. Reg. Paris,'' vol. i. p. 230, cod. mccx.&lt;/ref&gt; and who was born AH 33 (AD 653-4) and died AH 110 (AD 728-9).&lt;ref&gt;See A. Nicoll and [[E. B. Pusey]], ''Catal. Cod. Manuscr. Arab. Biblioth. Bodl.'' p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two names Ahmed or Achimet and Mohammed consist in Arabic of four letters each, and differ only in the first. 

There must, however, be some difference between Achmet's work, in the form in which we have it, and that of [[Ibn Sirin]], as the writer of the former (or the translator) appears from internal evidence to have been certainly a Christian, (c. 2, 150, &amp;c.) It exists only in [[Greek language|Greek]], or rather (if the above conjecture as to its author be correct) it has only been published in that language. 

It consists of three hundred and four chapters, and professes to be derived from what has been written on the same subject by the [[India]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], and [[Egypt]]ians. It was translated out of Greek into [[Latin]] about the year 1160, by [[Leo Tuscus]], of which work two specimens are to be found in Gasp. Barthii ''Adversaria.''&lt;ref&gt;xxxi. 14, ed. Francof. 1624, foil.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1165, it was used as a source by [[Pascalis Romanus]] for his ''Liber thesauri occulti'', a Latin compilation on dream interpretation that also draws on [[Artemidorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Thérèse d'Alverny, "Translations and Translators," in ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'' (University of Toronto Press, 1991), p. 438 [https://books.google.com/books?id=t86DEgHtc0wC&amp;pg=PA438&amp;lpg=PA438&amp;dq=%22Pascalis+Romanus%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HleLDqttaE&amp;sig=d-5BmZc8uvK-eldBvT-_8cYBt3s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bdvDSdO1DM7lnQfs-p3nDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result online.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published at Frankfort, 1577, 8vo., in a Latin translation, made by [[Leunclavius]], from a very imperfect Greek manuscript, with the title "Apomasaris Apotelesmata, sive de Significatis et Eventis Insomniorum, ex Indorum, Persarum, Aegyptiorumque Disciplina." 

The word Apomasares is a corruption of the name of the famous Albumasar, or [[Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Abu Ma'shar]], and Leunclavius afterwards acknowledged his mistake in attributing the work to him. It was published in Greek and Latin by [[Rigaltius]], and appended to his edition of the ''[[Oneirocritica]]'' of Artemidorus, Lutet. Paris. 1603, 4to., and some Greek various readings are inserted by [[Jacobus De Rhoer]] in his ''Otium Daventriense''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 338, &amp;c. Daventr. 1762, 8vo.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been translated into Italian, French, and German.

'''Alex''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Anthony Burgess]]' novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film adaptation of the same name]], in which he is played by [[Malcolm McDowell]]. In the film, his [[surname]] is '''DeLarge''', a reference to Alex calling himself '''The Large''' in the novel. In the film, however, two newspaper articles print his name as "Alex Burgess".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collativelearning.com/ACO%20chapter%2021%20.html|title=A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in-depth analysis by Rob Ager 2010|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009193022/http://www.collativelearning.com/ACO%20chapter%2021%20.html|archivedate=9 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the book and film, Alex was portrayed by [[Vanessa Claire Smith]] in the [[ARK Theatre Company]]'s [[multi-media]] adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'', directed by [[Brad Mays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arktheatre.org/|title=arktheatre.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bradmays.com/clockwork.html Production Photos from ''A Clockwork Orange,'' 2003, ARK Theatre Company, directed by Brad Mays]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/20/clockwork-orange-musical_n_904375.html?ir=Arts&amp;ref=fb&amp;src=sp |title='A Clockwork Orange' Songs To Be Performed For First Time In History |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 20 July 2011|accessdate=2011-11-28 |first=Lucas |last=Kavner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character overview==
Alex is the narrator, [[protagonist]] and [[antihero]] in the novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. The character is portrayed as a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] who robs, rapes, and assaults innocent people for his own amusement. Intellectually, he knows that such behaviour is morally wrong, saying that "you can't have a society with everybody behaving in my manner of the night". He nevertheless professes to be puzzled by the motivations of those who wish to reform him and others like him, saying that he would never interfere with their desire to be good; he simply "goes to the other shop".

He speaks [[Nadsat]], a teenage [[slang]] created by author Anthony Burgess. The language is based on largely English and [[Russian language|Russian]] words, but also borrows from other sources such as [[Cockney rhyming slang]], [[Romani language|Romani]] speech, and schoolboy [[colloquialism]]s. His beverage of choice is milk spiked with various drugs, which he and his fellow gang members ("droogs") drink to fortify themselves for "ultraviolence". Alex is very fond of [[European classical music|classical music]], particularly [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], whom he habitually refers to as "Ludwig Van". While listening to this music, he [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasises]] about endless rampages of rape, [[torture]] and slaughter. Alex's favourite melee weapon is a "cut-throat britva", or [[straight razor]].

==Character biography==
Alex lives with his parents in a block of flats in a [[dystopia]]n England in which his brand of "ultraviolence" is common. At the age of 15, he is already a veteran of state reform institutions (In the film, he is somewhat older). While the youngest of his gang, he is the most intelligent, and designates himself as the leader. Another member of the gang, Georgie, resents his high-handedness, and begins plotting against him along with the rest of the gang. One night, the gang breaks into a woman's house, and Alex assaults and kills her by ramming her face with a sculpture of a penis and testicles (in the book it is a bust of Beethoven). As Alex flees from the house after hearing police sirens, Dim hits him with a milk bottle (his chain in the book) and the gang leaves him to be arrested. Alex is found guilty of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Over the next two years, Alex is a model prisoner, endearing himself to the prison chaplain by studying the Bible. He is especially fond of the passages in the [[Old Testament]] portraying torture and murder. Eventually, prison officials recommend him for the Ludovico Technique, an experimental treatment designed to eliminate criminal impulses. During the treatment, prison doctors inject him with nausea-inducing drugs and make him watch films portraying murder, torture and rape. The treatment [[classical conditioning|conditions]] him to associate violent thoughts and feelings with sickness. Alex is particularly affected by watching footage of [[Nazi war crimes]] set to [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]], one of his favourite pieces of music, and he can no longer hear it without feeling sick.

His sentence is [[clemency|commuted]] to time served, and he is released. Once he returns to society, however, he finds that the treatment worked too well: any thought of violence brings him to his knees with pain, and he cannot defend himself. His parents have rented out his room, he is brutalised by his former victims, and beaten by his former accomplices Georgie and Dim, who are now police officers.

He collapses in front of an old house, owned by a writer the government considers "subversive". The writer is one of the gang's victims, but he does not recognise Alex, who had been wearing a mask as he and his friends beat the man and [[gang-rape]]d his wife, who later died of her injuries. When Alex tells him of his plight, the writer promises to help him. However, the writer realises who Alex is upon hearing him singing "[[Singin' in the Rain]]", the very song he had sung while raping his wife. He drugs Alex and forces him to listen to the Ninth Symphony, which causes Alex so much pain that he attempts suicide by jumping out of the window.

He survives, but is badly injured, and wakes up in a state hospital. His parents take him back, while the government, smarting from the bad publicity, gives him a well-paying job. The treatment, meanwhile, has worn off, and Alex is his old ultraviolent self again: "I was cured all right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heller |first=Jason |date=22 March 2010 |title=A Clockwork Orange, by Anthony Burgess |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/ia-clockwork-orangei-by-anthony-burgess-39379 |publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]'' |access-date=13 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)#Omission of the final chapter|the film ends here]], the novel features an additional chapter in which Alex, now a few years older, outgrows his sociopathy and begins to think about starting a family.

==Reception==
The [[American Film Institute]] rated Alex the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains#The list|12th greatest film villain]] of all time.

He has led the [[Social Democratic Rally]] (RSD-Gaskiya), a political party, since founding it in January 2004. Cheiffou was President of the [[Economic, Social and Cultural Council of Niger]] (CESOC) from January 2006 to February 2010, and he held the official post of [[Ombudsman]] from August 2011 to December 2015.

He was a delegate for the Association of Nigeriens Abroad at the 1991 National Conference; at the Conference, he was the compromise choice for the position of Prime Minister, although he was opposed by the delegates representing the government,&lt;ref name=My/&gt; and was elected on 26 October 1991.&lt;ref name=Presse&gt;Marie-Soleil Frère, ''Presse et démocratie en Afrique francophone'', Karthala Editions, page 117 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elected&gt;"Oct 1991 - Niger: Elections", ''Keesing's Record of World Events'', volume 37, October 1991, Niger, page 38,520.&lt;/ref&gt; His selection as Prime Minister was aided by his political inexperience and lack of association with the old regime of [[Seyni Kountché]] and [[Ali Saibou]].

As of 2002, Cheiffou was the ICAO's Regional Director for its Western and Central African Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icao.int/icao/en/ro/wacaf/apirg/2002/afi-ats1/Summary_en.pdf "First Meeting of the AFI Air Traffic Services Providers"], ICAO website, 26–28 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheiffou was Vice-President of the [[Democratic and Social Convention]] (CDS-Rahama) before splitting with that party and its President, [[Mahamane Ousmane]], and creating his own party, the [[Social Democratic Rally]] (RSD-Gaskiya), in January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-express.com/archive/OUEST/niger/pol/286cassureauseindu.htm "Cassure au sein du parti de Mahamane Ousmane, Amadou Cheiffou crée son propre parti"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629163250/http://www.afrique-express.com/archive/OUEST/niger/pol/286cassureauseindu.htm |date=2007-06-29 }}, ''Afrique Express'', number 286, 20 January 2004 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Niger presidential election, 2004|presidential election]] held on 16 November 2004, Cheiffou placed fourth out of six candidates, winning 6.35% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angolapress-angop.ao/noticia-e.asp?ID=298087 "Tandja, Issoufou for round two polling in Niger"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120538/http://www.angolapress-angop.ao/noticia-e.asp?ID=298087 |date=2007-09-29 }}, AngolaPress, 20 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[National Assembly of Niger|National Assembly]] in the [[Nigerien parliamentary election, 2004|December 2004 parliamentary election]] as an RSD candidate in Maradi constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee.ne/circons/circ_ord.htm |title=List of deputies elected in the 2004 election by constituency |accessdate=2005-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213002952/http://www.assemblee.ne/circons/circ_ord.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2005 }}, National Assembly website {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the 85-member Economic, Social and Cultural Council (CESOC) was installed by President [[Mamadou Tandja]] on 3 January 2006, Cheiffou became President of CESOC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africatime.com/guinee/nouvelle.asp?UrlRecherche=archives.asp%3Frech%3D1%26no_pays%3D11%26no_categorie%3D3%26keyword%3D%26BtnGo.x%3D7%26IsPanafricain%3D0%26IsAfrique%3D&amp;no_nouvelle=249363 "Le CESOC s’ouvre au public"], ''Le Republicain'', 6 April 2006 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSD supported President Tandja during the 2009 political crisis, and it participated in the [[Nigerien parliamentary election, 2009|October 2009 parliamentary election]]. The opposition, angered by President Tandja's efforts to change the constitution so that he could remain in power, boycotted the election. The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), which had wanted the election delayed in hopes of resolving the political crisis, suspended Niger from its ranks immediately after the election was held. Cheiffou was included in the 22-member Nigerien delegation that traveled to [[Abuja]] for talks with ECOWAS beginning on 9 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h8EGYE7kWdzGwJBo4XZIdWf5NG4A "Crisis talks on Niger start in Abuja"], Agence France-Presse, 9 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still serving as President of CESOC, Cheiffou stood as a candidate in the December 2009 local elections and was elected as a municipal councillor in Kornaka. Cheiffou's decision to run for local office was considered striking, as it was rare for major political leaders in Niger to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamtaminfo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2944:-cheiffou-amadou-elu-conseiller-municipal&amp;catid=44:politique&amp;Itemid=61 "Cheiffou Amadou élu conseiller municipal"], ''Roue de l'Histoire'', issue 488, 31 December 2009 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tandja was ousted in a [[2010 Nigerien coup|February 2010 military coup]]. In the [[Nigerien presidential election, 2011|January 2011 presidential election]], held under a transitional junta, Cheiffou stood again as a candidate, but received only a small share of the vote. On 10 February 2011, he announced his support for [[Mahamadou Issoufou]], who had placed first, in the March 2011 second round. He backed Issoufou along with many other unsuccessful candidates, buttressing Issoufou's position against his second round opponent, [[Seyni Oumarou]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE71A0J420110211 "Niger's Issoufou expands alliance ahead of run-off"], Reuters, 11 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; After Issoufou won the election, Cheiffou was appointed as Ombudsman on 24 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actuniger.com/politique/298-politique/2643-le-communique-du-conseil-des-ministres.html "Le communiqué du Conseil des ministres"], ''Le Sahel'', 25 August 2011 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anosh Irani''' (born 1974) is an [[Indo-Canadian]] novelist and playwright. An [[Irani (India)|Irani]] (like [[Parsi people|Parsi]], but of more recent [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] extraction), he was born and raised in [[Mumbai]], although he has indicated that he personally prefers the city's traditional English name, [[Bombay]]. After working in advertising in India, he moved to [[Vancouver]] in 1998 to study and pursue writing.

His first full-length play, ''[[The Matka King]]'', premiered in October 2003 at the [[Arts Club Theatre Company]] in Vancouver. His play, ''Bombay Black'', won four [[Dora Mavor Moore Awards|Dora Awards]], including Outstanding New Play. Irani was also featured in ''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]'' as one of a handful of young Canadian "writers to watch."

He published his [[debut novel]], ''The Cripple and His Talismans'', in 2004.  This dark fable won critical acclaim for its [[magic realism|magic realist]] depiction of the seedy beggars' underworld of India.

Irani's second novel, ''[[The Song of Kahunsha]]'', was chosen as a CBC Book Club One pick, and was selected for the 2007 edition of ''[[Canada Reads]]'', where it was championed by [[Donna Morrissey]]. Kahunsha is a story about the abandoned children of Bombay, struggling for survival and to hold on to hope amidst the violence of the 1993 racial riots.

His third novel, ''[[Dahanu Road (novel)|Dahanu Road]]'', was published in 2010. His fourth, ''The Parcel'', was published in 2016 and was a shortlisted finalist for that year's [[Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/two-debut-novelists-among-this-years-writers-trust-nominees/article31968963/ "Two debut novelists among this year’s Writers’ Trust nominees"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 21 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Governor General's Award for English-language fiction]],&lt;ref name=announce&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/governor-generals-literary-award-short-list-a-serious-case-of-deja-vu/article32229006/ "Governor-General’s Literary Award short list a serious case of déjà vu"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 4 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

His play ''[[My Granny the Goldfish]]'' premiered at the Arts Club Theatre Company's new venue, The Revue Stage, in Vancouver on 16 April 2010.

His play ''The Men in White'' was a shortlisted finalist for the [[Governor General's Award for English-language drama]] at the [[2018 Governor General's Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbc.ca/books/the-finalists-for-the-2018-governor-general-s-literary-award-for-drama-1.4840585 "The finalists for the 2018 Governor General's Literary Award for drama"]. [[CBC Books]], October 3, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
From 1998 Irani attended the [[University of British Columbia]].  He received his bachelor's degree in creative writing in 2002. 

He has since taught creative writing at [[Simon Fraser University]] and [[McGill University]]. In September 2014, Irani was the writer-in-residence at Simon Fraser University in the world literature department. He also taught a special topics course, "Writing for the Stage."

'''Hans Axel von Fersen''' ({{IPA-sv|hɑːns ˈaksɛl fɔn ˈfæʂːɛn|}}, known as '''Axel de Fersen''' in France; 4 September 1755{{snd}}20 June 1810) was a Swedish [[count]], [[Marshal of the Realm|Marshal of the Realm of Sweden]], a [[General|General of Horse]] in the Royal [[Swedish Army]], one of the [[Lord of the Realm|Lords of the Realm]], aide-de-camp to [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] in the American Revolutionary War, diplomat and statesman, and a friend of Queen [[Marie-Antoinette]] of France's. He died at the hands of a Stockholm [[lynching|lynch mob]].

==Life==
===Descent and early life===
von Fersen was born in 1755 to [[Fältmarskalk|Field Marshal]] [[Axel von Fersen the Elder]] and countess [[Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie]]. He was nephew of [[Eva Ekeblad]] and grandson of General [[Hans Reinhold Fersen]]. Axel was born the second of four children; he had two sisters, [[Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen|Hedvig Eleonora]] and [[Sophie Piper|Eva Sophie]], and one brother, [[Fabian Reinhold von Fersen|Fabian Reinhold]]. Two female cousins, [[Ulla von Höpken|Ulrika von Fersen]] and [[Augusta von Fersen|Christina Augusta von Fersen]], were Swedish ladies-in-waiting and leading socialites of the Gustavian age.
[[File:Count Fersen by Hallé.jpg|thumb|left|A young Axel von Fersen.]]
Fersen's ancestors came from Estonia to Sweden at the time of the [[Thirty Years War|Thirty Years' War]], which took place from 1618–1648. The family made their name during the reigns of [[Christina of sweden|Christina]] (queen regnant), [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X]], and [[Charles xi of sweden|Charles XI]]. In 1735, the von Fersen family purchased [[Steninge Palace]], which overlooks [[Mälaren]], a lake outside of [[Stockholm]], Sweden.

von Fersen's father, the de facto parliamentary leader of the [[Hats (party)|Hats]] party, was the most politically influential man in Sweden at that time and also one of the richest in the realm. He was the lord of four grand houses in Sweden: [[Löfstad Castle|Löfstad]] [inherited through his wife], [[Steninge Palace|Steninge]], [[Ljung Castle|Ljung]] and [[Mälsåker House|Mälsåker]]. He also owned mines, land, forests and iron foundries in Sweden and Finland, and a large share of [[Swedish East India Company|Sweden's East India Company]], the country's most profitable undertaking ever.

The younger Axel was influenced by French culture, owing in part to his father's services to [[Louis xv|Louis XV of France]]. Under his childhood tutor, von Fersen learned several languages including French, Latin, English, German and Italian. His later education was primarily military.

===The grand tour (1771–1775)===
On 3 July 1770, von Fersen made his first journey abroad with the intention of seeing the world and finishing his studies at military academies, including [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], [[Turin]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Lüneburg]]. In October 1771, he passed through Switzerland and in [[Ferney-Voltaire|Ferney]], he met the philosopher, [[Voltaire#Geneva and Ferney|Voltaire]]. In England nearly seven years later, von Fersen looked back on that meeting:

{{bquote|I once had two hours of his society when I was at [[Geneva]] some years ago. M. Constant, an intimate friend of his, gave me a letter of introduction to him ... I was struck by the beauty of his eyes and the vivacity of his expression. It was, I confess, curiosity rather than admiration which led me to seek his acquaintance ... He was not only extremely clever, but also very lucky; and one of the reasons of his success was that he was disliked, admired and befriended by different great people in such a way that his fame could not fail to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1902|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In November 1772, von Fersen continued on to [[Turin]], Italy, where he paid a visit to King [[Charles Emmanuel III]]. In January 1774 his travels took him to France where he paid court to the reigning monarch, [[Louis xv|Louis XV]], and his mistress, [[Madame du Barry]]. While at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] he attended the ceremony of the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]]. A little over a week later, von Fersen met [[Marie-Antoinette]], then [[Dauphine of France|Dauphine]], for the first time:

{{bquote|The Dauphine talked to me for a long time without me knowing who she was; at last when she was recognized, everybody pressed round her and she retired into a box at three o’clock: I left the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

von Fersen continued the Grand Tour by traveling to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|England]] where he stayed for roughly four months and met King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]]. By the beginning of 1775, von Fersen had returned to Sweden, where he remained for approximately three years, serving under his king, [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustavus III]].

===Marie-Antoinette===
In the late summer of 1778, von Fersen traveled to Normandy with his friends, Barrington Beaumont and the [[Curt von Stedingk|Baron de Stedingk]], to see a large army camp that was training under the command of the [[Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie|Duke of Broglie]]. Besides military matters, they were treated to dinner and dances attended by the officers and their wives. von Fersen later paid his respects to the French royal family for the first time since his grand tour more than three years earlier:

{{bq |text=August 26: "Last Tuesday I went to Versailles to be presented to the royal family. The queen, who is charming, said when she saw me, 'Ah! Here is an old acquaintance.' The rest of the family did not say a word to me."

September 8: "The queen, who is the prettiest and most amiable princess that I know, has had the kindness to inquire about me often; she asked [[Gustaf Philip Creutz|Creutz]] why I did not go to her card parties on Sundays; and hearing that I did go one Sunday when there was none, she sent me a sort of excuse. Her pregnancy advances and is quite visible."

November 19: The queen treats me with great kindness; I often pay her my court at her card-games, and each time she makes to me little speeches that are full of good-will. As someone had told her of my Swedish uniform, she expressed a wish to see me in it; I am to go Thursday thus dressed, not to Court, but to the queen's apartments. She is the most amiable princess that I know."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Marie-Antoinette's personal property, the [[Petit Trianon]], was on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles. In contrast to Versailles, the dress and manners at the Petit Trianon were simple and down-to-earth;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campan|first=Jeanne Louise Henriette|title=Memoirs of the Court of Marie Antoinette: Queen of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsi9-OlL23AC|date=January 1, 2009|publisher=The Floating Press|isbn=978-1-77541-158-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; her guests were personally invited and treated equally, as friends. However, the private festivities often caused jealousy among those who were excluded from them.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===The American Revolutionary War===
In the 1770s, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began with the passage of the [[Intolerable Acts|Intolerable acts]], and the battles of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]], and [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]]. von Fersen told Beaumont that in France "it is the fashion to rhapsodize over the Americans' rebelliousness against England".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1902|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; France had officially declared war against her "natural enemy" (Great Britain) in February 1778, but in the beginning of 1780, a French contingent was finally being outfitted to fight with the rebels on North American soil.

On May 4, 1780, von Fersen secured the position of [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|General Rochambeau]] and sailed from the port of Brest. Nearly two months later, his ship made anchor at [[Narragansett Bay]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], where the French made camp until June of the next year. In mid-September 1780, von Fersen set off as part of Rochambeau's suite to meet the American General, [[George Washington]], in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Washington's retinue included the young [[Alexander Hamilton]], General [[Henry Knox]] and the [[Marquis de Lafayette]]. On meeting Washington, von Fersen remarked:

{{bquote|He has the air of a hero; he is very cold, speaks little, but is polite and civil. An air of sadness pervades his whole countenance, which is not unbecoming to him, and makes him the more interesting.{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|p=30}} }}

After spending eleven months in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], in total inaction, the men under Rochambeau began a march on June 12, 1781, to link up with Washington's army at Philipsburg on the [[Hudson River|Hudson]]. On August 15, von Fersen was tasked with conveying a letter from Rochambeau to [[Jacques-Melchior Saint-Laurent, Comte de Barras|Comte de Barras]], who had been waiting for a signal to join [[François Joseph Paul de Grasse|Comte de Grasse's]] fleet at the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Word reached the troops in early September of [[Battle of the Chesapeake|Grasse's victory]] in gaining control of the Chesapeake, and by the end of the month Washington surrounded [[Cornwallis]] in [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]]. By October 19, the British surrendered the town, hastening the end of the war.

von Fersen and the rest of the French wintered in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. Anticipating the [[American Civil War]] nearly eighty years later, von Fersen remarked that he wouldn't be surprised to see Virginia separate herself from the rest of the states at some point due to the strain of "aristocracy" prevalent there as opposed to the northern states.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} In December 1782, the French made sail for the West Indies and Venezuela but word reached them of the signing of peace and the ships headed back to France. von Fersen arrived back in [[Brest, France|Brest]] in June 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yates|first1=Edmund Hodgson|last2=Tinsley|first2=William|last3=Downey|first3=Edmund|last4=Croft|first4=William|title=Tinsley's Magazine, Volume 35|date=1884|publisher=Tinsley Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Years leading up to the Revolution  (1783–1787)===
Following the end of hostilities, the United States and Sweden concluded a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Sweden)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]]. von Fersen was awarded the [[Society of the Cincinnati|Order of Cincinnatus]] by Washington, though he was forbidden by his monarch to wear a medallion earned fighting in a republican war.

In 1783, Gustavus III asked von Fersen to join him in Germany as [[Captain of the Guard]]. Gustavus was planning on making war on Denmark, and was on a trip through the Continent to secure aid from other countries. Gustavus promoted von Fersen to titulary-colonel in the Swedish army, chevalier of the [[Order of the Sword]], and lieutenant-colonel of the light-horse cavalry of the king. Gustavus also used his influence to persuade Louis to have von Fersen appointed [[proprietary colonel]] of the [[Royal Suédois]] French Army infantry regiment.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Louis also appointed von Fersen second-colonel of the [[Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment|Royal Deux-Ponts regiment]] and chevalier of the [[Order of Military Merit (France)|Order of Military Merit]].

On June 7, 1784 von Fersen returned to Versailles with Gustavus, who concluded a treaty of alliance with France on the 19th of the month. On June 27, Gustavus and the rest of his entourage were invited to the Petit Trianon. von Fersen sat in the royal box beside Marie-Antoinette. A month later von Fersen returned to Sweden, tasking himself with the job of getting a dog for Marie-Antoinette, which she named Odin.

von Fersen divided his time between Paris, Versailles, and his new regiment in [[Valenciennes]]. During this time, the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace|Diamond Necklace Affair]] took place, and only months later the [[Louis René Édouard, cardinal de Rohan|Cardinal de Rohan]] was arrested, bringing the affair to public knowledge. von Fersen wrote to his father in September that everyone believed the Queen (Marie-Antoinette) had fooled the King. In August 1786, [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne|Vicomte de Calonne]] finally apprised Louis XVI of the desperate state of the French finances, and by the very end of the year it was announced formally that there would be a convening of an [[Assembly of Notables]] to discuss future measures.

===The French Revolution===
In late-February 1787, the Assembly of Notables was convened. von Fersen attended the closing of the last day of that meeting, and described the gathering as "imposing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  von Fersen was secretly entrusted, by Gustavus III, with the role of special envoy to the King and Queen of France. Some sensitive diplomatic contacts between Sweden and France were conducted, not through the Swedish embassy, but through von Fersen. To be closer to Paris, he moved into a house in [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]] borrowed from Count Esterhazy.

In spring, 1788, von Fersen joined Gustav for the latter's [[Russo-Swedish War (1788–90)|Finnish campaign against Russia]] as lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Horse Guards&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wraxall|1863|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by December 1788, von Fersen was again with his French regiment in Valenciennes to witness the following:

{{bquote|All men's minds are in a ferment. Nothing is talked of but a constitution. The women especially are joining in the hubbub, and you know as well as I what influence they have in this country. It is a mania, everybody is an administrator and can talk only of progress; the lackeys in the antechambers are occupied in reading the pamphlets that come out, ten or twelve in a day, and I do not know how the printing-presses can do the work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|pp=69–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

On May 2, 1789, the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] finally met. von Fersen and Beaumont sat in one of the boxes of the [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi|Salle des Menus Plaisirs]] on May 5, as Louis read his opening speech. Before long, however, the Third Estate reconstituted itself as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], arguing that the three orders were no more than arbitrary divisions of one body. By the end of June, the monarchy had reinforced its concentration of regiments around the capital, ostensibly to maintain order in and around Paris, although many believed the troops would be turned against the recalcitrant Third Estate. von Fersen wrote:

{{bquote|They have brought about 12,000 to 15,000 troops into the neighborhood of Versailles, La Muette, [[Meudon]], etc. What is most grievous is that they are not sure of the French soldier, and they are forced to employ foreigners as much as possible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; }}

On July 14, 1789, the [[Storming of the Bastille|Invalides and the Bastille were both stormed and taken]], and on July 16, von Fersen was at Versailles with the King and Queen to debate how to forestall the incipient revolution in Paris. After much discussion, Louis decided to go to Paris with the guardsmen to show his personal goodwill towards the revolution. The [[Princess Marie Louise of Savoy|Princess de Lamballe]] (who in 1792 would lose her life in the [[September massacres|September Massacres]]) related the scene:

{{bquote|No sooner, however, had the King left the room than it was as much as the Count de Fersen, [[Princess Élisabeth of France|Princess Elizabeth]], and all of us could do to recover [the Queen] from the most violent convulsions. At last, coming to herself, she retired ... at the same time requesting Fersen to follow [Louis] to the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]. Again and again she implored him, as she went, in case the King should be detained, to interest himself with all the foreign ministers to interpose for his liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamballe|1901|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

von Fersen followed Louis to the capital and arrived in time to watch Louis take the national [[cockade]] from the mayor, [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], and placed it in his own hat. On August 8, the [[August Decrees]], which abolished many aspects of monarchy, including tithes and hereditary titles, were enacted. von Fersen wrote from [[Valenciennes]]:

{{bquote|Riots are taking place in all the cities of the kingdom ... So far all is confined to breaking into the tax offices and opening the prisons, for it is the lowest of the populace who make the disorder. The [[bourgeoisie]] was immediately armed and that did much to restore tranquility. We have had our little riot here but it is all over. Now the idle scoundrels have spread themselves over the country districts; they are pillaging, or putting under contribution all the abbeys and [[Chateaux|châteaux]]. They are hunted everywhere, and yesterday, in one spot, we captured 119; many more will probably be taken ... Disorder is increasing throughout the country. The [new militia in Paris] has better pay than in our regiments and there are no means not employed to entice them. It is said that ... there have been, since July 13th, 12,750 deserters, without counting the ''gardes françaises''. The king's authority is totally annihilated, so is that of the parliaments and the magistrates. The States-General themselves tremble before Paris, and this fear greatly influences their deliberations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; }}

Months later, with the revolution spreading to the rest of the country and the royal army in disintegration, the Flanders Regiment was brought to Versailles to replace the [[French Guards]] who had mutinied. The [[Garde du Corps (France)|King's bodyguard]] decided to host a fraternal dinner party for the regiment, and von Fersen and Beaumont attended. Despite having reservations at first, the King and Queen made an appearance towards the end. This banquet, however, provided fuel for the [[Women's March on Versailles]] four days later, when it was rumored that the tricolor (cockade) was trampled upon at the banquet. von Fersen was in Versailles to witness the march.

On the morning of October 6, 1789, an armed crowd made their way to the royal apartments. Two of the royal bodyguards were killed before the [[French National Guard|National Guard]] restored order. In order to calm the protestors, Louis agreed to go to the balcony of the Cour de Marbre and tell the crowd that he would return with them to Paris. von Fersen recounts the departure in his diaries:

{{bquote|I was witness of it all and I returned to Paris in one of the carriages of the king's suite: we were six hours and a half on the way [to Paris]. God keep me from ever again seeing so afflicting a sight as that of those two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Flight to Varennes===
{{bq |text="I have to be away tonight," said Axel, "and I will return for a few hours on Tuesday if I can ... It is supposed that I am going to [[Varennes]] to join my regiment."

"But I need not suppose so?" I queried.

"Not unless you like ... If I have not arrived at [[Arlon]] by twelve on Friday night, come back to Paris, unlock my bureau, and burn everything you find...; and, if within the next twenty-four hours you hear I am killed or imprisoned, burn all my papers. But I hope it will not come to that, for we have so arranged matters."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1902|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Conversation recalled by Barrington Beaumont on the afternoon of June 20th, 1791'' }}

The situation of the royal family became considerably more desperate on April 18, 1791, when they were prevented from traveling to [[Saint-Cloud]] to attend Mass by a large hostile crowd. Escape plans had been broached earlier between [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]] and von Fersen, but Mirabeau's death on April 2, 1791 put an end to that discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamballe|1901|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the aborted trip to [[Saint-Cloud|Saint Cloud]], von Fersen revived these plans with vigor. In June, he acquired a [[Berlin (carriage)|Berline]] and drove it to a courtyard at [[Eleanore Sullivan]]'s residence on the [[Boulevard de Clichy|Rue de Clichy]] in Paris. The escape was arranged to take place on June 20, coinciding with a particular guard change.

At 11:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. the royal children were brought out without difficulty. At 11:45 the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, appeared followed by Louis himself. A half hour later they were still waiting for Marie-Antoinette. However, she came out at the same time as the torchlit carriage of [[Marquis Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], who was responsible for the royal family's custody, appeared with some of his men, Marie-Antoinette was able to conceal herself and the royal family slipped away.

von Fersen drove the carriage, first from the [[Place du Carrousel]] to the [[Porte Saint-Martin]], and then on to the Barrier Saint-Martin where they switched to the Berine. von Fersen continued to drive as far as [[Bondy]], seven miles from Paris, where the Queen's maids and a fresh relay of horses awaited them. The royal family took the post road and von Fersen took a different route to [[Le Bourget|Bourget]].

The royal family reached [[Varennes]] on June 22 around 11 p.m., but here they were discovered and eventually held in custody until troops from the National Convention arrived. They departed Varennes surrounded by 6,000 armed citizens and National Guardsmen. Having left behind him a long declaration which had been read and published in all the newspapers in his absence, Louis himself had made it impossible to sustain the pretence that he had been "abducted".

===War against France  (1791–1793)===

Even before the royal family returned to Paris, it was discovered that von Fersen was one of the people who facilitated their escape, and a warrant was put out for his arrest. von Fersen left France and in [[Koblenz]] he put himself in touch with [[Comte d'Artois]], the exiled prince, and the former Controller-General, [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]]; together they made plans to convince the other European powers to declare war on France. In Brussels, von Fersen worked out a cypher code and secret methods of writing with Beaumont and Marie-Antoinette:

{{bquote|The simplest plan was to write an ordinary letter with the lines rather far apart, and then to write the real information between the lines, using milk instead of ink. The milk [[calligraphy]] was invisible until the paper was covered with coal or other dust; when the dust was shaken off, the secret writing stood out as black as that for which ink had been used. In this manner we wrote to each other, and sent the letters by couriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1902|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

From August 2–14, von Fersen was in [[Vienna]] to discuss the situation with Marie-Antoinette's brother [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]], now Emperor. On August 27, 1791 the [[Declaration of pillnitz|Declaration of Pillnitz]] was issued from [[Pillnitz Castle]] near [[Dresden]]; it declared the joint support of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Prussia]] for King Louis XVI against the Revolution but stipulated that Austria would only go to war if the other European powers followed them into war, which at this point in time was not likely to happen. von Fersen wrote:

{{bquote|I can see clearly that they are dragging things along purposely to prevent the king of Sweden from sending troops this year; they fear his activity, and also that he may command in person. They want to avoid acting, or else to act alone if it becomes necessary. Nothing is being done; the requisitions have not been sent, although they assure me the troops are to march at once ... I see a well-formed plan to do only trifling things over the winter, to try to patch up matters for the time being, and not to act until spring, and not then unless it is absolutely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
 
In December 1791, von Fersen confided to Beaumont about another possible escape attempt for the royal family. Because the roads were closely watched, it was decided that Louis should escape through the woods and then by sea, while von Fersen conveyed Marie-Antoinette and the children by another route. Because security was tight around the royal family, von Fersen traveled to Paris in a large wig and false moustache, and assumed the identity of a minister plenipotentiary of the Queen of Portugal. They arrived in Paris without difficulty, and were able to sneak into the Tuileries and speak with Marie-Antoinette. von Fersen laid the escape plan before Louis, however, the king did not feel that it would work. As he told von Fersen:

{{bquote|I know that I am called feeble and irresolute, but no one has ever been in a position such as mine. It is true that I lost the opportune moment; it was [[Storming of the Bastille|July 14]], I ought to have gone then, but you must remember that monsieur himself entreated me to stay, and the [[Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie|Marechal de Broglie]] said, "We can go to [[Metz]] certainly, but what is to be done when we get there?" I lost the opportunity, and it has not come again.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1902|p=169-1702}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

That night von Fersen saw the King and Queen for the last time. After the meeting, von Fersen and Beaumont headed back north. Outside [[Cambrai]], their carriage was stopped by a Frenchman doubting the authenticity of their passport but, with von Fersen feigning sleep, Beaumont managed to talk himself out of trouble and they continued on.

On March 16, 1792, Gustav III was shot at the Royal Opera House in Stockholm, and died almost two weeks later. In Sweden, Gustav's younger brother, the [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Duke Karl]], became regent to the underage [[Gustav IV]]. On April 20, France officially declared war on Austria, and invaded the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. On June 20, the Tuileries was stormed by a large crowd and Louis was made to wear a red bonnet of liberty and drink a toast to the health of the people of Paris and the Nation. Three days later Marie-Antoinette was able to get an encrypted letter out to von Fersen: "Your friend is in the greatest danger. His illness is making terrible progress ... Tell his relations about his unfortunate situation".

On November 7, following the [[Battle of Jemappes|French victory at Jemappes]], von Fersen wrote from [[Brussels]]:

{{bquote|[[Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil|Breteuil]] came to tell me that the Austrians have been defeated before Mons ... that retreat from Brussels is decided on ... At nine o’clock the news was made public; consternation and fear general; nothing as seen but people running about in search for means to get away. For two days there had been orders to give no post horses without permission ... The whole road from [[Mons]] was covered with war equipages and carts with wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

On January 21, 1793, Louis XVI was guillotined at the [[Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville|Place de Grève]]. Von Fersen heard the news while in Cologne: "Received last night at 10:30, from the Archbishop of [[Tours]], the sad details of the death of the King of France".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|p=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, France officially declared war against Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, but the tide quickly turned against the French in the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]]. The general in charge of the northern army, [[Dumouriez]], was defeated March 18 at [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Neerwinden]] and [[Leuven|Louvain]]. On 18 March, von Fersen was able to meet with him:

{{bquote|We struggled through a crowd of people and found him in a lower room, the windows besieged by the people outside. He was alone with three [[Aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]]. He recognized Simolin [Russian ambassador to France]; I named myself; he made me a compliment, saying he ought to have known me by my handsome face ... On the whole, I found him a true Frenchman, vain, confident, heedless; with much intelligence and little judgment. His scheme failed through excess of confidence in his strength and in his influence with the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|pp=289–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

On August 2, Marie-Antoinette was moved to the [[Conciergerie]] while awaiting her trial. During this time von Fersen was still attempting to find a way to save her and the remaining royal family. On 11 August he wrote:

{{bquote|Having talked with La Marck on the means of saving the queen, and agreeing that there were none except to push forward at once a strong body of cavalry to Paris - which would be the easier to do at this moment, because there are no troops before the city and the granaries are full, - I went to see Mercy about it and found him all ice to the idea ... He believes the royal family lost and that nothing can be done for them. He does not think the factious would negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

On October 6, 1793, von Fersen paid a visit to [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet (French revolutionary)|Jean-Baptisite Drouet]] at the Saint-Elizabeth prison on the slim hope of hearing news that might be of use. Drouet was the postmaster who recognized Louis on his flight to Varennes and was able to alert the authorities in time to stop them. Beaumont related the scene from his memoirs:

{{bquote|Fersen stood with his back to the light, wasted as few words as possible, and was stony in manner; even when both Drouet and the officer had the effrontery to assure him that ''Madame [[Capet]]'' was very well treated, had all she wished, and was in no danger, he did not comment. Could [[Germaine de stael|Madame de Staël]] have witnessed, she would doubtless have reiterated her usual observation as to his icy coldness of temperament, and his absolute insensitivity and passionless. I should have said that his nerves were strained almost to snapping, and that to see and speak to this [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet (French revolutionary)|Drouet]] was an almost unbearable test, even of his remarkable self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1902|pp=195–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Marie-Antoinette was executed ten days later. von Fersen heard the news of this while in Brussels:

{{bquote|Though I was prepared for it and expected it since the transfer to the [[Conciergerie]], I was devastated by the reality. I did not have the strength to feel anything ... I thought about her constantly, about all the horrible circumstances of her sufferings, of the doubt she might have had about me, my attachment, my interest. That thought tortured me.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Later years  (1793–1810)===
[[File:Hans Axel von Fersen1.jpg|thumb|Axel von Fersen in 1799.]] 
Von Fersen returned to Sweden, from where he was forced to watch the ever-increasing expansion of the French [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary empire]],&lt;ref name="Price2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Price, Munro|title=The Fall of the French Monarchy: Louis XVI,  Marie-Antoinette and the Baron de Breteuil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gMAFI5etnEC&amp;pg=RA2-PR25|accessdate=1 September 2013|date=23 September 2011|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4472-1169-3|page=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in late December 1793, he was suspected of possible complicity in [[Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt|Baron Armfeldt's]] conspiracy to deprive the [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Duke of Södermanland]] of the regency. As a result, von Fersen was deprived of his diplomatic appointments and his post as ambassador. In November 1796, Prince Gustav was declared of age and become King [[Gustav IV|Gustav IV Adolf]]. His accession restored von Fersen, and other supporters of Gustav III's, back to favor at court. Von Fersen and his best friend, Baron Taube, became two of the most influential advisors to the young king, inculcating in him a "steadfast opposition to Revolutionary France, close relations with Russia, and hostility to Denmark, with the ultimate objective of acquiring Norway".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1986|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1797, von Fersen attended the [[Second Congress of Rastatt]] and met general [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]:

{{bquote|When I called at his hotel to pay my compliments he asked would I be kind enough to tell him what minister from Sweden is now in Paris. As you know, there is none. My reply was necessarily vague. Then he said that it was astounding that the Court of Sweden should behave in such a manner towards a nation, with which it had been on more or less friendly terms for a long while. Before I had time to respond, he remarked that the Court of Sweden seemed to take a pleasure in sending agents and ambassadors who were personally disagreeable to every French citizen.

"No doubt," said he, "the king of Sweden would regard with disfavor a French minister who had attempted to raise the people of Stockholm against him. On the same principle, the French Republic ought not to allow men too well known for their connection with the late King and Queen of France to be sent to mock the minister of the first nation on earth."

It was impossible not to understand this. I felt somewhat as I had felt the day we interviewed [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet (French revolutionary)|Drouet]], and I preserved the same apparent indifference. I looked down serenely at ''M. le Général'' and merely said that I would make known to my Court what I had just heard; and I left him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1902|pp=269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

While in Germany, von Fersen made a trip to [[Karlsruhe]] to secure, for Gustav IV Adolf, the hand of the Princess Friederike of Baden's, whom Gustav IV Adolf married in October. In 1799, following von Fersen's return to Sweden from Germany, he was appointed as one of the [[Lord of the Realm|Lords of the Realm]].

In the fall of that year, Gustav IV Adolf was concerned about the level of sympathy for the French Revolution in the city of [[Uppsala]]. After students at [[Uppsala University]] celebrated Bonaparte's return to France from his [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|Italian campaigns]], Gustav IV Adolf appointed von Fersen as [[Uppsala University|Chancellor of Uppsala]]. According to Adlerbeth, this amounted to "a declared French royalist being made the Swedish Jacobins' schoolmaster".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} That winter a wave of rioting occurred in Stockholm, [[Gothenburg]], [[Norrköping]], [[Linköping]], [[Malmö]], and other Swedish towns following the onset of a severe winter and famine. Von Fersen wrote: "Who, given the spirit that now prevails, can guarantee that there will not be a general upheaval."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1986|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, an attempt to trick the Uppsala orchestra into performing a composition containing an excerpt from the "[[La Marseillaise]]" led to the trial and punishment of four known [[Radicalism (historic)|radicals]] of the university, one of whom was dismissed. The "Music Trial" proved the deathblow to Uppsala radicalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

With the state bordering on financial [[bankruptcy]], and poor harvests and declining trade undermining his efforts to resolve the issue without recourse to parliament, Gustav IV Adolf reluctantly announced the first assembly of the [[Riksdag]]. The [[Riksdag]], dissolved in mid-June but not before several prominent aristocrats walked out and renounced their noble status. Though creating a much-talked about sensation, they had virtually left a vacuum in the political field which their rivals filled.

In 1801, von Fersen was appointed [[Marshal of the Realm]]. He was now the highest official in the court of Sweden. Around this time, von Fersen's sister, Sophie, returned to Sweden from Germany and took over his household in lieu of a wife.

===Swedish politics and death===
[[File:Fersenska mordet 1810.JPG|thumb|Von Fersen killed by the mob]]
Following the overthrow and exile of King Gustavus IV in 1809, a dispute over the Royal succession divided the nobility and much of Swedish society. Von Fersen, now Earl Marshal of Sweden, led a political faction ("the [[Gustavians]]") which supported Gustavus' son against the popular [[Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden|Crown Prince Charles August]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=???|work=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=Fifteenth | page= 110|volume =IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 1810, while reviewing troops in [[Scania]], Charles August fell from his horse and died from [[apoplexy]]. Rumors ran strong throughout the country that he had been poisoned by the partisans of Gustav IV Adolf; von Fersen and his sister Sophie were seen as prime suspects. They were abused in public, and von Fersen received anonymous death threats.

June 20, 1810 was the date set for the Crown Prince's public funeral. The ''Livgarde till Häst'' (Horse Guards) formed the advance guard in the procession; von Fersen, as Marshal of the Realm, and other court dignitaries, rode in coaches before the coffin, while the rear of the procession was brought up by a squadron of cavalry which had accompanied the Crown Prince's remains from Scania. Foot Guards paraded on the [[Riddarhustorget]]. General Silfversparre, commander of the Stockholm garrison, was alerted to the possibility of disturbances but may himself have been a member of the court party that opposed von Fersen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mansel|first=Philip|title=Pillars of monarchy: an outline of the political and social history of royal guards, 1400-1984|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKBmAAAAMAAJ|date=October 1, 1984|publisher=Quartet Books|isbn=978-0-7043-2424-4|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procession proceeded slowly through the Hornsgatan and [[Södermalm]] Square, and was met with threats and insults as soon as it entered the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wraxall|1863|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|First curses then copper coins and various missiles were hurled at the carriage till its windows were broken; then savage threats and showers of stones become continuous, and, at last in the ''[[Riddarhustorget]]'', at the instant when the escort was turning to the right, a tremendous crowd barred the way of Fersen's carriage ... the [guards] remained passive while the rabble unharnessed the horses, and dragged Fersen out of the coach.}}

Von Fersen, with a violent effort, flung back one of the ruffians who grasped him and shook himself free of the others who were pressing round. There was a momentary lull; the curses shrank from shouts to mutterings. Von Fersen's face bled where a stone had cut it; his decorations were glittering in the sun; the guards, who were supposed to protect him, gazed at him with a sort of curious expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1902|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at this moment when Beaumont arrived on the scene with General Silfversparre and a small detachment of troops. This intervention further enraged the large crowd. Von Fersen, realizing that the authorities planned to do nothing, turned and dashed into the first door he could find. The crowd converged on this spot, and a few ran into the house in pursuit of him.

{{bquote|Silfversparre, and I, and our sixteen men were utterly helpless, so tightly were we wedged in the crowd that we might just as well have been blocks of wood for all the power we had of independent movement. We were carried along by the surging crowd, and it seemed to me as though hell were let loose around us.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1902|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Before long, one man appeared at the window "and with a triumphant shout" hurled down von Fersen's cloak and sword, which were seized by the angry crowd. Von Fersen was dragged back out into the square. His gloves were pulled off and thrown in his face, and his coat torn off and trampled upon. Silfversparre, attempting to save von Fersen, offered to arrest him and have him tried in court for the Crown Prince's murder. At this moment, the mounted escort turned and rode away. The mob "which had been almost quiet, but now raised yells of delight and triumph, and fell upon von Fersen".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1902|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Fersen's contemporary, Baron [[Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt|Gustaf Armfelt]], stated afterward:

{{bquote|One is almost tempted to say that the government wanted to give the people a victim to play with, just as when one throws something to an irritated wild beast to distract its attention. The more I consider it all, the more I am certain that the mob had the least to do with it ... But in God's name what were the troops about? How could such a thing happen in broad daylight during a procession, when troops and a military escort were actually present?&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Fersen, Hans Axel, Count von|volume=10|pages=291–292|first=Nisbet, Robert |last=Bain|authorlink=Robert Nisbet Bain}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Axel von Fersen died that day in Stockholm as Sweden's highest-ranking official next to the King; his death sent shock waves throughout the country. The cause of death was determined to be "crushing of the ribcage" when the Swedish-Finn [[Otto Johan Tandefelt]] jumped with both feet on Fersen's chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindqvist|first1=Herman|title=Axel von Fersen (Swedish Edition)|date=1991|publisher=Fischer|isbn=9170546576|page=281|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
A few months after the murder, von Fersen and his family were cleared of any suspicion connected with the death of [[Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden|Carl August of Augustenburg]], and he finally received a state burial with all pomp and ceremony. His sister, Sophie Piper, withdrew from Stockholm to her Löfstad manor, near [[Norrköping]]. Here she raised a memorial to her brother, with the inscription:

''Åt en oförgätlig broder, mannamodet uti hans sista stunder den 20 juni 1810 vittna om hans dygder och sinnes lugn'' ({{lang-en|To an unforgettable brother, the courage in his last moments on the 20th of June 1810, bears testimony to his virtues and clean conscience}})

==Relationship with Marie-Antoinette==
The young nobleman was a favorite at the French court, owing partly to the recollection of his father's devotion to France, but principally because of his own amiable qualities. Queen [[Marie-Antoinette]], who had first met von Fersen when they both were 18, was especially attracted by the grace and wit of "''le beau''" von Fersen.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; However, it was nearly four years later, on von Fersen's second visit to France in the summer of 1778, when the relationship blossomed. Here he was accepted by Marie-Antoinette into her trusted circle and invited to her private gatherings at the Petit Trianon. It seems that the friendship grew very quickly and caused jealousy among those at court. By the account of Beaumont's, von Fersen left for the war in America in the early part of 1780 to avoid causing a scandal, as it was widely known that the two were close, and it was rumored that he was the Queen's lover.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1902|pp=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaumont wrote in his memoirs that von Fersen asked [[Gustaf Philip Creutz]] to use his influence, as Swedish ambassador to France, to get von Fersen appointed as ''aide-de-camp'' to Rochambeau. According to Creutz in a letter to Gustav III:

{{bquote|The young Count Fersen has been so well received by the queen that this has given umbrage to several persons. I own that I cannot help thinking that she had a liking for him; I have seen too many indications to doubt it. The conduct of the young count has been admirable on this occasion for its modesty and reserve, but above all, in the decision he made to go to America. By thus departing he avoided all dangers; but it needed, evidently, a firmness beyond his years, to surmount that seduction. The queen's eyes could not leave him, during the last days, and they often filled with tears.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Fersen|1902|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

It is impossible to state how far the relationship went. It was difficult for the Queen of France to remain alone for long; she was almost always accompanied by others, such as attendants of the court. At the time that Marie-Antoinette was rumored to be Axel's lover, she was also rumored to be the lovers of the [[Duc d'Orléans]], the [[Comte d'Artois]], and others.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Portrayal in popular culture==
{{in popular culture|date=July 2017}}
*Von Fersen is portrayed by [[Tyrone Power]] in the film ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' (1938), opposite [[Norma Shearer]] as Marie-Antoinette.

Here, his affair with Marie-Antoinette is a source of much of the drama of the period, and a driving cause behind the Queen's aloof behavior.
*In the French two-part epic film, ''[[La Révolution française (film)|La Révolution française]]'' (1989), Von Fersen, played by [[Jean-Yves Berteloot]], is depicted as Marie-Antoinette's lover.

*Von Fersen's character appears in the popular book, ''[[The Bane Chronicles]]'' (2014), in almost complete historical context and as a friend of the warlock Magnus Bane's, with whom he shares a kiss.

'''Clinton Eugene "Clint" Curtis''' (born 1958) is an American attorney, computer programmer and ex-employee of [[NASA]] and [[ExxonMobil]]. He worked for [[Yang Enterprises]] (YEI) until February 2001. He is notable chiefly for making a series of [[whistleblower]] allegations about his former employer and about [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Tom Feeney]], including an allegation that in 2000, Feeney and Yang Enterprises requested Curtis's assistance in a scheme to steal votes by inserting fraudulent code into touch screen voting systems.

In 2006, Curtis ran unsuccessfully against Feeney for the United States congressional seat in [[Florida's 24th congressional district]].&lt;ref name=OrlandoSentinel110806&gt;{{cite news

In 2007, Curtis enrolled as a student at the [[Barry University School of Law]] in [[Orlando, Florida]].

In 2010, Clint Curtis was the Democratic nominee for Congress in California's [[California's 4th congressional district|4th district]], ultimately losing to incumbent Representative [[Tom McClintock]].

==Initial allegations against Yang Enterprises and Tom Feeney==

In 2001, Curtis first achieved public attention for a series of allegations against his former employer, Yang Enterprises, and against Tom Feeney, who was at that time serving as a Florida state legislator and as Yang's attorney and as Yang's [[lobbying|lobbyist]] for local governments.

On May 10, 2001, shortly after leaving Yang and accepting a job with the [[Florida Department of Transportation]], Curtis reported that Yang had overbilled the FDOT and hired an illegal alien.&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During that same year, Curtis's accusations against Yang were the subject of a series of articles in the [[Daytona Beach News-Journal]].&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news
| last = Zetter
| first = Kim
| title = More Questions for Florida

| date= 2004-12-13

| accessdate = 2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Note: Wired confirms that the stories existed, but a Nexis search for the actual 2002 stories would be helpful--&gt;

Yang Enterprises denied Curtis's allegations, and alleged that Curtis was a disgruntled former employee.&lt;!--needs cite--&gt; According to the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', Curtis made his initial accusations against Yang one day after attorneys for Yang Enterprises questioned whether Curtis's employment with the FDOT violated a [[non-compete clause|non-compete agreement]] and whether Curtis had taken a confidential computer program with him when he left Yang. According to the ''St. Petersburg Times'', "Curtis said he would not have filed complaints about Yang if the company had not harassed him."&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt;  Curtis denies that he stole any software from Yang Enterprises, and as of August 10, 2006, a lawsuit between Yang and Curtis was ongoing in [[Leon County, Florida]].&lt;ref name=OrlandoWeekly/&gt;

Ultimately, Curtis' initial allegations led to mixed results:
* After investigation, the Florida Department of Transportation demanded that Yang repay $97,000 in "questionable charges," but was unable to conclude whether Yang had engaged in intentional misconduct, largely because of poor record keeping and Yang's refusal to permit the FDOT to audit Yang's files directly during the course of litigation.
* According to documents from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at the Florida Dept. of Transportation (FDOT) and according to Federal officials at the Homeland Security Department's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, convicted spy and Chinese national, Hai Lin Nee (a/k/a Henry Nee) had been --- as Curtis alleged, first in 2001 and again in his sworn affidavit,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bradblog.com/Docs/CC_Affidavit_120604.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; an illegal alien during the period that Curtis worked with him at YEI.&lt;ref name="bradblog.com"&gt;http://www.bradblog.com/?page_id=4454&lt;/ref&gt;  The report also shows that YEI --- who has on several occasions denied that Nee was ever an employee, or even a consultant at YEI --- petioned the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on Nee's behalf to extend his visa sometime during 1999.&lt;ref name="bradblog.com"/&gt;
* Curtis's charges that then-state representative Tom Feeney improperly lobbied the Florida Department of Transportation on behalf of Yang, were considered, but ultimately rejected by the Florida State Commission on Ethics.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite news

In September 2004, Curtis self-published ''Just A Fly On The Wall'', a book critical of the [[George W. Bush administration]], Yang Enterprises, and Tom Feeney.&lt;ref name=OrlandoWeekly/&gt;&lt;ref name=fly&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=Clint |authorlink=Clint Curtis |title=Just A Fly On The Wall |publisher=Clint Curtis Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-9761959-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the edition of that book published before the 2004 election, Curtis focused on his earlier accusations against Yang, as well as accusations that Feeney used his influence with the Florida State government to Yang's benefit.&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt;&lt;ref name=OrlandoWeekly/&gt;

==Vote-rigging allegations==
Curtis specifically alleged that:

At the behest of Rep. Tom Feeney, in September 2000, he was asked to write a program for a [[touchscreen]] [[voting machine]] that would make it possible to change the results of an election undetectably.&lt;ref name="murder lies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votinglies.com/ |title=Murder, Spies &amp; Voting Lies: The Clint Curtis Story |publisher=Votinglies.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis assumed initially that this effort was aimed at detecting [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] fraud, but later learned that it was intended to benefit the Republican Party.

Curtis explained that the software could be used in any electronic tabulation machine or scanner. He spoke about this to the [[Conyers Voting Forum]], after [[John Conyers|Conyers]] left the forum and turned over the dais on December 13, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070103051335/http://www.hack247.co.uk/2006/11/02/american-election-hacker-testifies/ American Election Hacker Testifies], ''Hack247.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feeney's response to allegations==
In 2005, Feeney responded to Curtis's allegations in a news article posted in the ''St. Petersburg Times''. According to the newspaper, Feeney stated:
*that he had no recollection of ever meeting Curtis or of discussing vote fraud with anyone;
*that he could not have discussed a plan to commit fraud in touch screen voting machines in September or October 2000, as alleged by Curtis, because, "touch screen voting machines were not even contemplated until November 2000"; and
*that although Curtis accused Feeney of a wide variety of misconduct in his 2004 book, ''Just A Fly On The Wall'', Curtis never mentioned the alleged vote fraud scheme.&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt;

==Investigations==
On March 3, 2005, Curtis passed a [[polygraph]] test given by Tim Robinson, the retired chief polygraph operator and 20-year veteran of the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]]. The polygraph was paid for by Kevin Walsh, a private investigator from [[Washington, D.C.]], who told the ''St. Petersburg Times'' that he had been hired to prove election fraud. Walsh refused to identify the client.&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt; Curtis has stated that the test was based on all the allegations in the [[affidavit]] that was provided to Conyers' Voting Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradblog.com/?p=1315|publisher=[[Brad Friedman]]|title=Of Polygraphs, Pulitzers, Patriots and Prevaricators...|date=2005-04-11|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=This is a self-published blog; if these facts are notable and reputable, certainly a better source exists ||date=July 2016}}

==Congressional campaign==
{{Main article|Florida U.S. House election, 2006}}
In 2006, Curtis ran a campaign to unseat Republican incumbent Tom Feeney, the former attorney for Yang Enterprises and the person who Curtis had accused, since 2004, of soliciting Curtis to assist in attempted vote fraud in the 2000 election.

Curtis won the Democratic primary.

Curtis's accusations that Feeney solicited him to commit vote fraud played a central role in the campaign, with Curtis challenging Feeney to take a polygraph test to prove that Feeney did not commit vote fraud and Feeney engaging in a campaign to trivialize Curtis, including a website that called Curtis "crazy" and featured photos of Curtis altered to include a [[tin-foil hat]],&lt;ref name=OrlandoSentinel110806/&gt; and a controversial flier with Curtis's head superimposed on what appeared to be [[Hugh Hefner|Hugh Hefner's]] body.&lt;ref name=WFTV&gt;{{cite news

On October 26, 2006, ''[[The Orlando Sentinel]]'' reported on the status of Curtis's race against Tom Feeney. According to the ''Sentinel'', although both Curtis and Feeney had reported that their internal polling showed them to be leading in the polls, a [[Zogby International|Zogby]] poll showed the race to be extremely close, with Feeney leading Curtis by 45 percent to 43 percent, with a 5 percent margin of error. &lt;!---maybe this breathless, news at 11 junk should be deleted now?---&gt;

''The Sentinel'' reported that "local political observers" attributed the tight race to several factors, including:
*recent Feeney scandals such as his accepting an overseas golf trip from [[Jack Abramoff]];
*the growing influence of non-party-aligned voters;
*Feeney's strategy of trivializing Curtis rather than confronting him directly; and
*general voter disenchantment with the Republican party.&lt;ref name=OrlandoSentinel102606&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert

Curtis lost the general election, garnering 42 percent to Feeney's 58 percent of the vote, or 89,863 votes to Feeney's 123,795.

==Media coverage==

===Wired News===
On December 13, 2004, ''[[Wired News]]'' reported on Curtis's allegations. After repeating Curtis's allegations, summarized above, and Yang Enterprises' denial of those allegations, ''Wired'' concluded that "it remains to be seen if any new investigations can uncover the truth". In particular:

*Curtis originally stated that his employer, Yang Enterprises, specifically told him that he had been asked to develop code not to test voting security, but in order to commit vote fraud. "Her words were that it was needed to control the vote in West Palm Beach, Florida," Curtis said. "Once she said, 'We need to steal an election,' that put me back. I made it clear that I could not produce code that could do that and no one else should."
*"[Curtis] claims he did later tell the [[CIA]], the [[FBI]], an investigator for Florida's Department of Transportation (Raymond Lemme), and a reporter for the ''Daytona Beach News-Journal'' about the voting issues when he gave them other information about Yang and Feeney. But so far this has not been corroborated. The FBI did not return calls for comment. The Department of Transportation investigator is dead" (Raymond Lemme was found dead. It was ruled a suicide. Curtis and Lemme's brother, among others, are convinced that it was murder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insider-magazine.com/unrestricted_warfare.htm |title=Unrestricted Warfare |publisher=Insider-magazine.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
*''Wired'' also reported that "some details of Curtis' statements don't check out."  For example, although Curtis originally stated that he was specifically informed that his code was to be used to falsify touch screen voting results in West Palm Beach in 2000 even though West Palm Beach did not use touch-screen voting machines at that time. Curtis responded that his code could have been used in other voting machines or in 2002.
*Adam Stubblefield, a computer science graduate student who wrote a paper about [[Diebold]]'s voting machines, told ''Wired'' that Curtis's code would not have been used in any voting machine, even assuming fraud, because (1) Curtis did not have access to any original voting machine source code, and (2) the code that Curtis claims to have written was "so trivial" that it would be easier to write new code than to try to incorporate Curtis's code into the actual voting machine.
*Laura Zuckerman, a former reporter for the ''Daytona Beach News-Journal'', told ''Wired'' that she worked closely with Curtis in 2002 to write several stories regarding Curtis's various charges against Yang Enterprises at the time, but that Curtis never discussed any alleged conspiracy to commit vote fraud.
*However, ''Wired'' also noted that other accusations made by Curtis are "somewhat corroborated." For example, ''Wired'' was able to find a Florida Department of Transportation employee to support other charges made by Curtis against his former employer, Yang Enterprises, although most of those allegations have not led to formal charges. (Curtis alleges that Feeney has "squelched" the investigations). ''Wired'' also noted Curtis's willingness to make his allegations in an affidavit and his offer to take a polygraph test "is what makes some believe him".&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

=== Other media coverage ===
* On April 9, 2005, the ''St. Petersburg Times'' published an article about Curtis's charges and potential Senate campaign, including a confirmation that Curtis had taken and passed a polygraph test regarding his charges.&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt;
* On August 10, 2006, the ''[[Orlando Weekly]]'' published an article surveying Curtis's charges, Feeney and Yang's responses, and the surrounding publicity.&lt;ref name=OrlandoWeekly/&gt;
* The documentary ''Murder, Spies &amp; Voting Lies'' chronicled Clint Curtis's story was released in 2008 and won a number of awards, including best documentary at the [[New Jersey Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="murder lies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1341751|Murder, Spies &amp; Voting Lies: The Clint Curtis Story (2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Clint Curtis also appears in an interview in the documentary, ''[[Stealing America: Vote by Vote (film)|Stealing America: Vote by Vote]]''.

'''Eleazar of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]''' (אלעזר מוורמייזא) (c. 1176–1238), or '''Eleazar ben Judah ben Kalonymus''', also sometimes known today as '''Eleazar Rokeach''' ("Eleazar the Perfumer"  אלעזר רקח) from the title of his ''Book of the Perfumer'' (''Sefer ha rokeah'' ספר הרקח)—where the [[Gematria|numerical value]] of "Perfumer" (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) is equal to Eleazar, was a leading [[Talmudist]] and [[Kabbalist]],&lt;ref name=Jewish/&gt; and the last major member of the ''[[Hasidei Ashkenaz]]'', a group of German [[Jewish]] [[pietist]]s.

== Biography ==
Eleazar was most likely born in [[Mainz]]. He was a descendant of the great [[Kalonymus]] family of Mainz, and a disciple of [[Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg]] (Judah he-Hasid),&lt;ref name=Jewish/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Trachtenberg|first=Joshua|title=Jewish Magic and Superstition|location=Philadelphia|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|year=2004|origyear=Originally published 1939|isbn=9780812218626|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; who initiated him into the study of the [[Kabbalah]], at that time little known in Germany. According to [[Leopold Zunz|Zunz]], Eleazar was [[hazzan]] at [[Erfurt]] before he became [[rabbi]] at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. In 1233 he took part in the Synod of Mainz which enacted the body of regulations known as "[[Takkanot Shum]]" (ShUM = "Speyer, Worms, Mainz"),&lt;ref name=Jewish/&gt; of which he was a signatory.

[[File:Massacre of Jews.jpg|thumb|Massacre of the Jews of [[Metz]] during the First Crusade, by Auguste Migette.]]
According to the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', Eleazar underwent great sufferings during the [[Crusades]]. The ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' states that on the night of 22 [[Kislev]], 1196, he was engaged on his commentary on ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'' (Eleazar relates that he had reached the [[parashah]] [[Vayeshev]]), when two [[Crusaders]] entered his house and killed his wife Dulca (Dolce), his two daughters Belet(Belette) and Hannah, and wounded him and his son Jacob. His wife had conducted a business in parchment scrolls in order to support the family and enable him to devote all his time to study.&lt;ref name=Jewish&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=E&amp;artid=153|article=Eleazar ben Judah ben Kalonymus of Worms|accessdate=Jan 11, 2017}}&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the ''[[piyyutim]]'' he authored protest at Israel's suffering and hope for redemption and revenge against her tormentors. He also recorded the deaths of his family in a moving and poetic eulogy.

Eleazar developed a vigorous activity in many directions. On the one hand, he was a Talmudist of vast erudition, a [[liturgist]] gifted with a clear and easy style, and an [[astronomer]], and was well versed in the sciences open to the Jews of Germany at that time. At the same time, he was an adventurous mystic who experienced visions, seeing legions of angels and demons. He exerted himself to spread mystical systems which went far beyond the conceptions of the classical authors of Jewish esoterica. In his mystical works he developed and gave a new impulse to the mysticism associated with the letters of the alphabet.  By the [[gematria]] and [[notarikon]] systems of interpretation found in the Talmud, Eleazar invented new combinations by which miracles could be performed. The [[haggadic]] [[anthropomorphism]] which he had combated in his earlier works (''Ha-Roḳeaḥ,'' ''Sha'are ha-Sod weha-Yiḥud'') occupied later the foremost place in his mystical writings.
Eleazar's great merit therefore lies not only in his new mystical system, but also in his ethical works. In these he shows greatness of soul and a piety bordering upon [[asceticism]]. Though so severely tried by fate, he inculcates cheerfulness, patience, and love for humanity. He died at Worms in 1238.&lt;ref name=Jewish/&gt;

== Ethical works ==
* ''Ha-Roḳeaḥ,'' ("The Perfumer"), a halachic guide to [[ethics]] and [[Halakha|Jewish Law]] for the common reader.  The title derives from the numerical value of the word רקח, which corresponds to that of אלעזר.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], New York, where his father had migrated from Barbados in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=About /&gt; Brath grew up in [[Harlem]] and [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]], and attended the [[High School of Industrial Art]] (now Art and Design), later winning a college scholarship to the [[School of Visual Arts]].&lt;ref name=About /&gt; 

In 1956, he was among the co-founders of the African Jazz-Art Society &amp; Studios "to reclaim jazz as music of contemporary African traditions that should be controlled by black artists", and in 1962, he began working as a graphic artist for [[ABC Television Network|ABC Television]], remaining there until his retirement in 1999.&lt;ref name=About /&gt; 

Brath fought to eliminate the usage of the term "negro" and, in 1961, launched a "[[Black is Beautiful]]" campaign with a series of Afrocentric fashion shows featuring African-American women who were known as the Grandassa models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ra|first1=Amun|title=Happy Natural Day|url=http://happilynaturalday.com/consciousness/ajass-and-the-grandassa-models-origins-of-the-black-is-beautiful-movement/|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sported large afros.

In 1975 Brath founded, with Irving Davis, the Patrice Lumumba Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patrice Lumumba Coalition|url=http://africanactivist.msu.edu/organization.php?name=Patrice%20Lumumba%20Coalition|publisher=African Activist Archive|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=About /&gt; which supported the right to self-determination for Angolans, South Africans, and Namibians and other African liberation movements. In 1976, the Coalition released a policy memo calling for the support of the Zimbabwe Liberation Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patrice Lumumba Coalition|title=Southern Africa Must Be Free! USA Subversion Must Be Exposed!|url=http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-1DE1-84-PLC%208-25-76%20opt.pdf|website=African Activist Archive|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They garnered attention for a 1977 boycott of ''[[Ipi Tombi]]'', a Broadway musical that purportedly misrepresented life under [[apartheid]].

Brath was the host of the New York City radio show ''Afrikaleidoscope'' on [[WBAI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Minter, William, Gail Hovey, and Charles Cobb, Jr|title=No Easy Victories: African Liberation and American Activists Over a Half Century, 1950–2000|date=2007|publisher=Africa World Press|page=199|isbn= 9781592215744}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often organized events and panels in the city to bring attention to African politics and current events.

In 2003, Brath cofounded the World African Diaspora Union (WADU) to advocate for the unification of the [[African Diaspora]] politically, culturally, and economically with Africa. WADU was officially launched in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World African Diaspora Union|url=http://www.wadupam.org/about|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great thinkers whom Brath counted as influences — [[Marcus Garvey]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Carlos A. Cooks]], and his cousin [[Clennell Wickham]] — waged a political battle on behalf of working-class blacks in colonial [[Barbados]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/harlem-mourns-death-activist-elombe-brath-article-1.1800926 |title=Harlem mourns death of Elombe Brath, lifelong warrior in battle for pan-African empowerment |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=May 21, 2014 | accessdate=February 7, 2015 |author=Ransom, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brath died in Harlem at the age of 77.

==Genesis==
[[File:Czeslawa-Kwoka2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Czesława Kwoka]] – one of many Polish Children of Zamojszczyzna murdered in Auschwitz by Nazi Germans]]
{{main|Pacification actions in German-occupied Poland}}
Wartime fate of the Polish children from Zamojszczyzna was closely related to the German plans for the expansion of their own so-called "[[Lebensraum|living space in the East]]", part of a broader Nazi policy called the ''[[Generalplan Ost]]''. The plans for "ethnically cleansing the land" of its inhabitants were created in the fall of 1941 in Berlin and were closely connected with the idea of the new [[RKFDV|great consolidation of German nationhood]]. Country-wide actions dubbed ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' ("Home to the Reich") were conducted across all of Central and Eastern Europe (see [[Action Saybusch]] in Polish Silesia). Their main purpose was to transplant colonists [[Volksdeutsche|of the German origin]] from [[Russia]], [[Romania]], and other countries, to occupied Poland. At the beginning of war, the programme was mainly realised in western parts of Poland, including [[Greater Poland|Wielkopolska]], [[Silesia]] and [[Pomerania]] already controlled by Nazi Germany; but after [[Operation Barbarossa]], it was continued throughout the [[General Government]].&lt;ref name="Piotrowski"/&gt;

In order to prepare the land for the new German settlers, both German military and all ''[[Ordnungspolizei#Police Battalions|branches of police]]'' including ''[[Sonderdienst]]'', aided by the [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police]] battalions,&lt;ref name="Jaczyńska"/&gt; conducted mass deportations of native Polish inhabitants using [[Holocaust trains]] as well as [[Lorry|lorries]] and even horse-drawn [[wagon]]s. Zamojszczyzna was recognized as one of the core German settlement areas in ''[[Distrikt Galizien]]'', and according to the order of [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] became the first intervention target in the region.&lt;ref name="TVP"/&gt; People of Ukrainian blood, subjects of parallel transfer called ''Heim ins Reich Ukraineraktion'' [[:pl:Ukraineraktion|(pl)]], were also to be resettled there.&lt;ref name="Piotrowski"/&gt;

==The forcible depopulation of Zamojszczyzna==
[[File:Wysiedlanie-Zamojszczyzna.jpg|thumb|left|Expulsions of Poles from the Zamość region in December 1942]]
The German [[Wehrmacht]] attacked the Soviet forces in eastern Poland on June 22, 1941, and in the euphoric atmosphere surrounding their initial victories, the ''Aktion Zamosc'' was first outlined by Himmler together with Governor [[Hans Frank]] who initially requested that the programme be delayed until complete victory, but was convinced otherwise.&lt;ref name="Jaczyńska"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://ipn.gov.pl/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/83266/1-40750.pdf | title=Aktion Zamosc | publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance]] | work=Pamięć.pl ''Nr 8/2012'' | location=OBEP IPN, Lublin | date=2012 | accessdate=19 August 2015 | author=Agnieszka Jaczyńska | at=30-35 (1-5 in PDF)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the General Plan East, the first forcible removal of the 2,000 inhabitants from selected villages was conducted between 6th and 25 of November 1941, while the general deportation programme began a year later on the night of 27–28 November 1942 in [[Skierbieszów]] and its vicinity. By then, the murderous [[Operation Reinhard]] was already in full swing.&lt;ref name="Jaczyńska"/&gt;

The expulsions encompassed the districts of [[Hrubieszów]], [[Tomaszów Lubelski]], [[Zamość]] and [[Biłgoraj]], and were completed in March 1943. In total 297 Polish villages were depopulated.&lt;ref name="wypędzeni"/&gt; A concentration camp was created in Zamość around the streets of Piłsudskiego and Okrzei. Initially, it was a transit camp for Soviet [[POW]]s, rebuilt and expanded with 15 new barracks added for the imprisonment of rounded up families. ''SS-Unterscharführer'' Artur Schütz was appointed the camp's commandant.&lt;ref name="Jaczyńska"/&gt; From there, transports of children no older than 14 years of age – whose names have already been Germanized – were sent elsewhere.&lt;ref name="wypędzeni"/&gt; Historians estimate that 116,000 people in total were forcibly removed from Zamojszczyzna, among them 30,000 children.&lt;ref name="Piotrowski"/&gt;

===Deportations to concentration camps===
[[File:Kinder Kz.jpg|thumb|right|Roll-call for boys at the main [[Łódź Ghetto#Deportations|children's concentration camp]] in [[Łódź]], to which [[Dzierżązna, Łódź Voivodeship|KZ Dzierżązna]] for Polish girls as young as eight, belonged to as a sub-camp]]

The camp in Zamość [[:pl:Obóz przesiedleńczy w Zamościu|(pl)]], located on S. Okrzei street, served as the transit point for selections and further deportations. In the first month of Action Zamość the camp processed 7,055 Polish inhabitants of 62 villages.&lt;ref name="Jaczyńska"/&gt; People were divided into four main categories with the following code letters: "WE" (re-Germanization), "AA" (transport to the Reich), "RD" (farm-work for the settlers), "KI" (''Kindertransport''), "AG" (work in the [[General Government]]); and finally, "KL" (concentration camp).&lt;ref name="dompomnik"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dompomnik.pl/podmenu,5,3,historia_dzieci_zamojszczyzny.html | title=Historia Dzieci Zamojszczyzny | publisher=Stowarzyszenie Domu Dziecka - Pomnika im. Dzieci Zamojszczyzny w Siedlcach | work=Historia | date=2012 | accessdate=20 August 2015 | author=Monika Wach, WSRP w Siedlcach | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those expelled from Zamojszczyzna to [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|perform slave labour]] in Germany were loaded onto trains departing for temporary displacement camps governed by main resettlement HQ in [[Łodź]]. People from the last group were sent to the [[Nazi concentration camps]] at [[Auschwitz]] and [[Majdanek]].&lt;ref name="Jaczyńska"/&gt;

The camp in Zamość processed 31,536 Poles according to Germany's own records,&lt;ref name="Jaczyńska"/&gt; or 41,000 based on postwar estimates.&lt;ref name="TVP"/&gt; Dispossessed Polish families were sent to other transit camps as well including [[Zwierzyniec]] in the Zamość County, which processed 20,000-24,000 Poles (12,000 between July and August 1943).&lt;ref&gt;Jaczyńska 2012, p. 33 (4 / 5 in PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; Transit camps existed in [[Budzyń, Opole Lubelskie County|Budzyń]],&lt;ref name="dompomnik"/&gt; [[Frampol]], Lublin (on Krochmalna street), [[Stary Majdan, Biłgoraj County]], [[Tarnogród]], Wola Derezieńska, Old Wedan, [[Biłgoraj]] and also in [[Puszcza Solska]].&lt;ref name="Szymanik"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bilgoraj.com.pl/72-rocznica-likwidacji-obozu-przesiedlenczego-w-zwierzyncu,,2,11,11,1,14165,nkultura.html | title=72. rocznica likwidacji obozu przesiedleńczego w Zwierzyńcu | publisher=Bilgoraj.com | work=Dzieci zamojszczyzny | date=2015-08-17 | accessdate=21 August 2015 | author=Bolesław Szymanik, Zarząd Stowarzyszenia Dzieci Zamojszczyzny w Biłgoraju }}&lt;/ref&gt; Race selections based on forcible abduction of children from their parents were conducted in all of them.&lt;ref name="Szymanik"/&gt; The term "Children of Zamojszczyzna" originates from the multitude of those locations.&lt;ref name="Jaczyńska"/&gt;

{{quote|I have seen with my own eyes how the Germans took children away from their mothers. The act of their forcible separation shook me terribly... The Germans beat them with whips until the blood flew in case of slightest opposition, mothers and children alike. One could hear moaning and crying throughout the entire camp on those occasions... I have also seen small children being killed by the Germans. – Leonard Szpuga, farmer expelled from [[Gmina Zwierzyniec|Topólcza]] &lt;ref&gt;Roman Hrabar, Zofia Tokarz, Jacek E. Wilczur, ''Czas niewoli czas śmierci'', Interpress, Warszawa 1979, p. 46. {{OCLC|69560199}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Polish children in Nazi-German labor camp in Dzierżązna.jpg|thumb|left|Polish girls at a Nazi-German camp in [[Dzierżązna]] near [[Zgierz]]. Among the prisoners were children resettled from Zamojszczyzna (1942-1943)]]

Children suffered the most in those camps. The average stay lasted several months.&lt;ref name="dompomnik"/&gt; Starvation, cold, disease were fatal for them a lot more often than for adults. Separated from their parents, children were transported in cattle wagons (100 up to 150 children in one wagon) to other destinations. Many of them were sent to the [[Kinder KZ|concentration camp for children]] run side-by-side with the [[Łódź Ghetto]]. Kinder KZ processed up to 13,000 children. News about enormous drama of children from Zamojszczyzna quickly spread through entire country. Polish railwayman were forwarding messages about transports to inhabitants of the cities where transports were stopping by. There were several stations where ordinary people took a chance and risked rescuing the children, like in [[Sobolew, Lublin Voivodeship|Sobolew]], [[Żelechów]], [[Siedlce]], [[Garwolin]], [[Pilawa]] and [[Warsaw]]. Another deportation action, called [[Operation Werwolf]],&lt;ref name="Jaczyńska"/&gt; was conducted during the summer of 1944 ahead of the Soviet advance. Many of the inhabitants were forced to evacuate after being previously transferred into these areas by Germany as early as 1939.&lt;ref name="dompomnik"/&gt;  Entire families ended up in concentration camps at [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] (up to 15,000 prisoners of Action Zamość) and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Oświęcim]], before deportation to forced labour in the Reich. At Majdanek, due to severe overcrowding, entire train-loads were kept in open fields numbered from III to V.&lt;ref name="Jaczyńska"/&gt;

==Germanization==
There was also a portion of children designated for [[germanisation]]. Those, in which German anthropologists confirmed the presence of desirable racial traits, were supposed to go through transition by being placed in German families or German orphanages.
Out of several thousand of children taken to Germany only 800 were successfully reclaimed.

After the World War II this atrocity was investigated in Nuremberg. From Polish side statements came from [[Zygmunt Klukowski]] – a doctor from Szczebrzeszyn, who knew well conditions of camps in Zwierzyniec and Biłgoraj, and from three of the returned children.

[[File:Fred P. Evans.png|thumb|Fred P. Evans]]
'''Fred P. Evans''' (born 1862) was a British spiritualist [[Mediumship|medium]].

He was born in [[Liverpool]] on 9 June 1862. His great grandfather was the Welsh social reformer [[Robert Owen]]. As a young man, Evans worked as a [[sailor]] and claimed to have experienced strange [[psychic]]al events.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, J. J. (1893). ''Psychography: Marvelous Manifestations of Psychic Power Given Through the Mediumship of Fred P. Evans, Known as the "Independent Slate-Writer"''. San Francisco, Hicks-Judd Company.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 he moved to [[San Francisco]] where he gave séances to the public. Evans was an early proponent of slate-writing mediumship.&lt;ref name="Melton 2013"&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton|Melton, J. Gordon]]. (2013). ''The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena''. Visible Ink Press. pp. 308-309. {{ISBN|978-1578592098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British biologist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] who attended a séance with Evans in 1887 was convinced the slate-writing phenomena was genuine evidence for [[Spiritualism|spirit communication]] and reported that there were five different coloured messages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace, Alfred Russel]]. (1908). [https://archive.org/stream/myliferecordofev00wall#page/352/mode/2up ''My Life: A Record of Events and Opinions''] London: Chapman &amp; Hall. pp. 352-354&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate-writing was popular in the late-nineteenth century but was discredited as fraudulent after investigations from [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]] and [[Parapsychology|psychical researchers]].&lt;ref name="Melton 2013"/&gt; In 1898, the magician [[Chung Ling Soo]] revealed the fraudulent slate-writing methods that Evans, [[Henry Slade]] and others had utilized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chung Ling Soo|Soo, Chung Ling]].

'''George R. Cogar''' (born 1932) was the head of the [[UNIVAC 1004]] electronic design team code named the "bumblebee project", and later the "barn project", and co-founder of '''Mohawk Data Sciences Corporation''', a [[Herkimer (village), New York|Herkimer, N.Y.]]-based multimillion-dollar business built largely on his invention of the [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3483523.pdf Data Recorder] [[magnetic tape]] encoder, which was introduced in 1965 and eliminated the need for [[keypunch]]es and [[punched cards]] by direct encoding on tape.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy V. Jones, "Data-Recorder Takes Short Cuts; Punch-Card Use Eliminated By Direct Coding on Tape Wide Variety of Ideas Covered By Patents Issued During Week", ''New York Times'', December 13, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/tabulating-machines-csci-01/ Tabulating Machines] bookrags.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3483523.pdf Patent 3483523]&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the Cogar Corporation, where he built an [[intelligent terminal]]—an early forerunner of the modern [[personal computer]]—which he called the Cogar System 4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cogar System 4: System Summary|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/cogar/Cogar_System_4_System_Summary.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Cogar 4. The Cogar 4 became the Singer 1500 after [[Singer Corporation|Singer Business Machines]] acquired Cogar Corporation. In 1976 [[International Computers Limited]] (ICL) acquired Singer Business Machines, changing the name of the computer to the ICL 1500.

==Disappearance==
Cogar was last seen Friday, September 2, 1983, when a private plane, a [[Britten-Norman Islander]], went down somewhere in [[British Columbia]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1683dmbc.html The Doe Network: Case File 1683DMBC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASN&gt;{{cite web|last=Ranter|first=Harro|author2=Lujan, Fabian I.|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19830902-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Britten-Norman BN-2A-21 Islander C-GIPF Smithers, BC |date=2010 |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundations==
Cogar and his wife Ann established the Cogar Foundation for the express purpose of awarding grants and [[scholarship]]s to students of [[Herkimer County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herkimer.edu/foundation/scholarships Scholarships] Herkimer County Community College.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Morland''' (26 June 1763 in [[London]]{{snd}}29 October 1804 in [[Brighton]]) was an English [[Painting|painter]]. His early work was influenced by [[Francis Wheatley (painter)]] but after the 1790s he came into his own style. His best compositions focus on rustic scenes: farms and hunting; smugglers and gypsies; and rich, textured landscapes informed by [[Dutch Golden Age painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Gowing]], ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.3 (Facts on File, 2005): 472.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
[[Image:Sketch of George Morland by J.R. Smith (1736-1804).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A portrait of George Morland by J. R. Smith (1736–1804). N.B: this picture has also been accredited as J. R. Smith by George Morland.]]
[[File:George Morland - A Party Angling - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Morland – ''A Party Angling'']]
[[File:George Morland - The Anglers' Repast - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Morland – ''The Anglers' Repast'']]

George Morland was born in London on 26 June 1763. He was the son of [[Henry Robert Morland]], and grandson of [[George Henry Morland]], said by Cunningham to have been lineally descended from Sir [[Samuel Morland]], while other biographers go so far as to say that he had only to claim the baronetcy in order to get it. 
Morland began to draw at the age of three years, and at the age of ten (1773) his name appears as an honorary exhibitor of sketches at the [[Royal Academy]]. He continued to exhibit at the Free Society in 1775 and 1776, and at the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]] in 1777, and then again at the Royal Academy in 1778, 1779 and 1780.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Morland, George|volume=18|page=839|first=George Charles|last=Williamson|authorlink=George Charles Williamson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His talents were carefully cultivated by his father, who was accused of stimulating them unduly with a view to his own profit, shutting the child up in a garret to make drawings from pictures and casts for which he found a ready sale. 
The boy, on the other hand, is said to have soon found a way to make money for himself by hiding some of his drawings, and lowering them at nightfall out of his window to young accomplices, with whom he used to spend the proceeds in frolic and self-indulgence. 
It has been also asserted that his father, discovering this trick, tried to conciliate him by indulgence, humouring his whims and encouraging his low tastes.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

He was set by his father to copy pictures of all kinds, but especially of the Dutch and Flemish masters. Among others he copied [[Fuseli]]'s ''Nightmare'' and [[Joshua Reynolds|Reynolds]]'s ''Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy''. 
He was also introduced to Sir Joshua Reynolds, and obtained permission to copy his pictures, and all accounts agree that before he was seventeen he had obtained considerable reputation not only with his friends and the dealers, but among artists of repute. 
A convincing proof of the skill in original composition which he had then attained is the fine engraving by [[William Ward (engraver)|William Ward]], after his picture of ''The Angler's Repast'', which was published in November 1780 by [[John Raphael Smith]]. 
It is said that before his apprenticeship to his father came to an end, in 1784, Romney offered to take him into his own house, with a salary of £300, on condition of his signing articles for three years. 
But Morland, we are told, had had enough of restraint, and after a rupture with his father he set up on his own account in 1784 or 1785 at the house of a picture dealer, and commenced that life which, in its combination of hard work and hard drinking, is almost without a parallel.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

Morland soon became the mere slave of the dealer with whom he lived. 
His boon companions were "ostlers, potboys, horse jockeys, moneylenders, pawnbrokers, punks, and pugilists."
In this company the handsome young artist swaggered, dressed in a green coat, with large yellow buttons, leather breeches, and top boots. "He was in the very extreme of foppish puppeyism", says Hassell; "his head, when ornamented according to his own taste, resembled a snowball, after the model of Tippey Bob, of dramatic memory, to which was attached a short, thick tail, not unlike a painter's brush."
His youth and strong constitution enabled him to recover rapidly from his excesses, and he not only employed the intervals in painting, but at this time, or shortly afterwards, taught himself to play the violin. 
He made also an effort, and a successful one, to free himself from his task-master, and escaped to [[Margate]], where he painted miniatures for a while. 
In 1785 he paid a short visit to France, whither his fame had preceded him, and where he had no lack of commissions.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

Returning to London, he lodged in a house at [[Kensal Green]], on the road to [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], near [[William Ward (engraver)|William Ward]], intercourse with whose family seems for a time to have had a steadying influence. It resulted in his marriage with Miss Anne Ward (Nancy), the sister of his friend, in July 1786, and the bond between the families was strengthened a month later by the marriage of William Ward and Morland's sister Maria. 
The two newly married couples set up house together in High Street, Marylebone, and Morland for a while appeared to have become a reformed character. 
He was now becoming known by such engravings from his pictures as the large 'Children Nutting' (1783), and several smaller and more sentimental subjects published in 1785, like the ' Lass of Livingston.' To 1786, the year of his marriage, is said to belong the series of 'Letitia or Seduction' (well known from the engravings published in 1789), in which with much of the narrative power of Hogarth, but with softer touches, the 'Progress' of Letitia is told in six scenes admirable in design, and painted with great skill, finish, and refinement. About this period he was fond of visiting the [[Isle of Wight]], where he painted his best coast scenes, and studied life and character in a low public-house at Freshwater Gate, called the Cabin.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}} In 1786 he painted ''The Wreck of the Haswell'', an oil on canvas. It shows women and children clutching what little of the ship remains afloat while a crewman's eyes tell the eventual fate of his half-submerged body. It clearly conveys the terror and hopelessness that must grip people when they know they're taking their last breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB904788499185335500|title=Inside a Nautical Lost and Found|first=Mark|last=Yost|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
[[File:Two pigs lying in straw in an outdoor pen. Etching with aqua Wellcome V0021681.jpg|thumb|left|Etching: ''Two pigs lying in straw in an outdoor pen''.]]

After three months the double household was broken up by dissensions between the ladies, and Morland took lodgings in Great Portland Street, and afterwards moved to Camden Town, where he lived in a small house in Pleasing Passage, at the back of the tavern known as Mother Black Cap. The attractions of the neighbouring inns, and of the Assembly Rooms at Kentish Town, now proved too strong for him, and he returned to all his bad habits. 
A long illness of his wife, following her confinement and death of the child, further weakened the influence of home, and he neglected and ultimately left his wife, though he seems to have made her an allowance as long as he lived. 
When he finally separated from her it is not easy to determine, and his course afterwards was so erratic that it is difficult to trace it with minuteness and order. He moved from Pleasing Passage to Warrens Lane, and seems for some time to have made his headquarters at Paddington. 
It was here probably that he painted the celebrated picture of 'The Inside of a Stable,' now in the [[National Gallery]], which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1791. 
The stable is said to be that of the White Lion Inn at Paddington, opposite to which he lived. 
At this time he was at the plenitude of his power, and dissipation had not impaired the sureness of his touch, his unusually fine sense of colour, or the refinement of his artistic feeling. He exhibited again in 1793 and 1794, but though he still painted finely he had become completely the prey of the dealers, painting as it were from hand to mouth to supply himself with funds for his extravagances. 
His art was so popular that, comparatively small as was the price which he actually received for his labour, he might have easily lived for a week on the earnings of a day. He was besieged by dealers who came to him, as it is said, with a purse in one hand and a bottle in the other. 
The amount of work he got through was prodigious. 
He would paint one or two pictures a day, and once painted a large landscape with six figures in the course of six hours. 
Every demand that was made upon him, whether a tavern score or the renewal of a bill, was paid by a picture. 
And they were good pictures too, generally worth many times the value of the account to be settled, and always popular in engravings. {{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

==Career==
[[File:George Morland - The Old Water Mill - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Old Water Mill'']]
[[File:George Morland - Winter Landscape - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Morland - ''Winter Landscape'']]
[[File:George Morland - Old horses with a dog in a stable - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Horses with a dog in a stable'']]

From 1788 to 1792 inclusive, over a hundred engravings after Morland were published. 
They included 'A Visit to the Child at Home' and 'A Visit to the Boarding School,' two compositions of remarkable refinement and elegance, and a number of charming scenes of children's sports, like 'Children Birdnesting,' 'Juvenile Navigation,' 'The Kite entangled,' 'Blind Man's Buff,' and 'Children playing at Soldiers.' Equalling if not exceeding these in popularity were scenes of moral contrast, like 'The Fruits of early Industry and Economy' (1789) and 'The Effects of Extravagance and Idleness' (1794), the 'Miseries of Idleness' and the 'Comforts of Industry,' both published in 1790, and subjects appealing to national sentiment, like 'The Slave Trade' (1791) and 'African Hospitality.' Five hundred copies of the engraving of 'Dancing Dogs' (1790) were sold in a few weeks, and one dealer gave an order for nine dozen sets of the four plates of 'The Deserter' (1791). Elegant and refined subjects gradually gave place exclusively to scenes from humble life in town and country, including the coast with fishermen and smugglers, sporting scenes, but more frequently, in a plain but seldom a coarse manner, the life of the cottage, the stable, and the inn-yard, with lively groups of natural men and women, and still more natural horses, donkeys, dogs, pigs, poultry, and other animals. 
About 250 separate engravings from his works appeared in his lifetime.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

Although the publishers reaped the benefits of their large sale, Morland's credit and resources enabled him for some years to lead the rollicking life he loved without much pressure of care. 
At one time he kept eight saddle horses at the White Lion. 
As time went on debts increased and creditors became more pressing, and he lived a hunted life, only able to escape from the bailiffs by his knowledge of London and the assistance of friends and dealers. He flitted from one house to another, residing among other places at Lambeth, East Sheen, Queen Anne Street, the Minories, Kensington, and Hackney. 
At Hackney his seclusion aroused the suspicion that he was a forger of bank notes, and his premises were searched at the instance of the bank directors, who afterwards made him a present of 40l. for the inconvenience caused by their mistake.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

Dealers and innkeepers also would keep rooms ready for him to paint in, supplied with the necessary materials, and there was generally some dealer at hand ready to carry off his pictures before they were dry, often before they were finished. 
Morland was not, however, much more scrupulous in his dealings than the dealers themselves, and a picture begun under contract with one would be parted with to another who had money in his hand, if the rightful owner was not there to claim it. 
In this way a number of pictures got into the market commenced by Morland, and finished by inferior hands, while hundreds of copies were made and sold as originals. 'I once saw,' says Hassell, 'twelve copies from a small picture of Morland's at one time in a dealer's shop, with the original in the centre.' 
Another dealer (according to Redgrave), in whose house he painted under contract in the morning for several years (commencing about 1794), had each morning's work regularly copied. Occasionally Morland managed to escape from both dealers and bailiffs. 
Once he paid a visit to [[Claude Lorraine Smith]] in Leicestershire. 
He was apprehended as a spy at [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]]. 
He painted the sign of an inn called the Black Bull, somewhere on the road between Deal and London.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

In November 1799, Morland was at last arrested for debt, but was allowed to take lodgings 'within the rules,' and these became the rendezvous of his most discreditable friends. 
During this mitigated confinement he sank lower and lower. 
He is said to have often been drunk for days together, and to have generally slept on the floor in a helpless condition. 
It is probable that these stories are exaggerated, for he still produced an enormous quantity of good work. 
'For his brother alone,' says Redgrave, 'he painted 192 pictures between 1800 and 1804, and he probably painted as many more for other dealers during the same period, his terms being four guineas a day and his drink.' 
Another account says that 'during his last eight years he painted 490 pictures for his brother, and probably three hundred more for others, besides making hundreds of drawings. 
His total production is estimated at no less than four thousand pictures. 
In 1802, he was released under the [[Insolvent Debtors Act]], but his health was ruined and his habits irremediable. 
About this time he was seized with palsy and lost the use of his left hand, so that he could not hold his palette. 
Notwithstanding he seems to have gone on painting to the last, when he was arrested again for a publican's score, and died in a sponging-house in Eyre Street, Cold Bath Fields, on 27 October 1804. His wife died three days afterwards, and both were buried together in the burial-ground attached to [[St. James's Chapel]] in the Hampstead Road.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

[[File:George Morland - Setters - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Dogs In Landscape - ''Setters'']]
The finest of Morland's pictures were executed between 1790 and 1794, and amongst them his picture ''The inside of a stable''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=10291&amp;searchid=9762|title=‘Inside of a Stable’, George Morland, exhibited 1791 - Tate|first=|last=Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Tate Britain]], London) may be reckoned as a masterpiece. In the last eight years of his life Morland produced some nine hundred paintings, besides over a thousand drawings.

He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1784 down to 1804. 
Amongst these was the remarkable 1788 picture ''Execrable Human Traffic or the Affectionate Slaves''. 
Two years later he exhibited a companion picture showing Africans caring for shipwrecked Europeans. They were subsequently published as prints and served to promote abolitionism.&lt;ref&gt;See the article by Meredith Gamer in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012. {{ISBN|9781908590435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morland was a close friend of fellow artist, [[William Armfield Hobday]] (1771–1831) who painted a portrait of the artist which is still intact. [[William Collins (painter)|William Collins]] was an informal pupil and later wrote a biography.

At MIT, the terms ''hack'' and ''hacker'' have many shades of meaning,&lt;ref name=JargonFile&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric|title=The Meaning of 'Hack'|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html|website=The Jargon File (version 4.4.7)|accessdate=2011-05-03|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HHH&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Sam|title=Hack, Hackers, and Hacking|url=http://www.faifzilla.org/appendixb.html|website=FAIFzilla.org [website]|publisher=Sam Williams|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackDefinitionBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

The origin of this usage is unknown, but it seems to have been widespread at MIT by the 1960s, and the [[hacker ethic]] has since spread into [[cyberculture]] and beyond.  Over time, the term has been generalized to describe anybody who possesses great technical proficiency in any particular skill, usually combined with an offbeat sense of humor.  The manifestation of hacker culture in the form of spectacular pranks is the most visible aspect of this culture to the world at large, but many hacker subcultures exist at MIT, and elsewhere.  This article focuses mostly on prankish aspects; for a fuller description of hacker culture, see "[[Hacker (term)]]".

[[Roof and tunnel hacking]], a form of [[urban exploration]], is also related to but not identical to "hacking" as described in this article.  Some hacks do involve overcoming barriers to physical access (e.g. placing a half-scale [[Apollo Lunar Module]] atop the Great Dome),&lt;ref name=ApolloHack&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo Lunar Module on the Great Dome|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2009/apollo_lander/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but many other stunts do not require such specialized skills.

==Cultural aspects==
Viewed from an [[anthropology|anthropological]] perspective, hacking is a cultural tradition affirming [[social cohesion|group solidarity]], but some hacks can also be viewed as individualistic creative or [[artistic expression]].  For example the "Massachusetts Toolpike" hack&lt;ref name=Tech11040&gt;{{cite web|last=Mehta|first=Prabhat|title=Journal of IHTFP a joyful account of MIT hacks|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N40/hacks.40a.html|website=The Tech|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was a clear instance of [[installation art]]&lt;ref name=GnomeInfestationWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Gnome Infestation|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2003/gnomes/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KeypadArtWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Cluster keypad artwork|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2003/keypad_art/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or [[environmental art]].&lt;ref name=RockGardenHackWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Squanch Rock Garden in 2-4-6 Courtyard|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2000/tetazoo_garden/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hacks which involve staged public actions&lt;ref name=BOYD&gt;{{cite web|title=Bring out your Dead|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1996/dead/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PerfHackWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance Hacks|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_topic/performance.html|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PerfHackBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

"Tribute", "memorial", or "commemorative" hacks note the arrival, passing, or anniversary of some noteworthy person, tradition, institution, or idea (e.g. the 10th anniversary of Wikipedia).&lt;ref name=Wiki10th&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia 10th Anniversary|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2011/wikipedia/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another broad category of hacks contains strong elements of [[social commentary]] or [[demonstration (people)|street protest]] (e.g. "Nth Annual Spontaneous Tuition Riot"&lt;ref name=TechTuition&gt;{{cite web|last=Chung|first=Jennifer|title=Students Protest Tuition Hike During Traditional Annual Riot|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V119/PDF/N12.pdf|website=The Tech|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) about events on campus or in the world at large.  But the strongest element of many hacks is the sheer joy of conceptualizing something new, and then reifying it with effective engineering, both technical and social (e.g. installing a full-sized mockup solar-powered subway car on the parapet wall around the base of the Great Dome, and then ''driving it back and forth under remote wireless control'' from Killian Court, some five stories below, ''after sundown'').&lt;ref name=SolarSubwayWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Powered Subway Car on the Great Dome|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2009/solar_powered_subway/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SolarSubwayBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.F.|title=Nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=13, 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most art exhibitions, the great majority of hacks are temporary installations; most are removed within a day or so by MIT Physical Plant, the MIT Confined Space Rescue Team (CSRT),&lt;ref name=HackCSRTBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=192–195|chapter=Zen and the art of hacking; It's not a job, it's an adventure}}&lt;/ref&gt; or occasionally by the hackers themselves.  It is a traditional courtesy to leave a note or even engineering drawings behind, as an aid to safe de-installation of a hack.&lt;ref name="HackCSRTBook"/&gt;  Sometimes, the hacks have been de-installed so quickly that members of the MIT community and the general public have had little opportunity to view them.  On very rare occasions, community protests have caused the MIT administration to quietly allow a hack to be re-installed and left for a proper viewing interval.&lt;ref name=Kilroy&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

The [[MIT Museum]] maintains an extensive collection of original hacker artifacts and documentation, and displays some larger items semi-permanently in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]].&lt;ref name="StataHacks"/&gt;

Although many traditional college pranks have involved maximizing embarrassment or inconvenience for a victim or target, such antics are usually disparaged by MIT hackers as "unimaginative" or "boring".  Often the target of a hack is an abstract concept (e.g. [[bureaucracy]] or "[[political correctness]]", or [[entropy]]), and the prank may or may not be aimed at any specific individual.  Even when an individual is targeted (e.g. the "disappearing office"&lt;ref name=VestOffice&gt;{{cite web|title=The Disappearing President's Office (The Bulletin Board Hack)|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1990/vest_bboard/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TechVest&gt;{{cite web|title=Moving the Institute forward into the next century, Charles Vest thinks globally|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N43/vest.43n.html|website=The Tech|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of newly arrived MIT President [[Charles Marstiller Vest|Charles Vest]]), the jest is good-natured, often eliciting admiration rather than anger from the "victim".

Writers for the third-party, independent Internet prankster site ''Zug'' once compared humorous responses at MIT and Harvard, by posting similar banners over main entrances to their respective campuses which proclaimed "Institute of Nowlege".  Regarding Harvard, they concluded, "The question: is the sense of humor still alive in modern-day Harvard students? The answer, it turns out, is ''no''."  Regarding MIT, they said, "So it's official: MIT students have a better sense of humor, hands down, than Harvard students. MIT students are more imaginative, more fun-loving, and probably smarter as well.  Truly, MIT is the Institute of NOWLEGE."  The ''Zug'' pranksters also noted and documented great differences in the reactions of [[campus police]], maintenance workers, and passersby, upon seeing the ironically [[pun]]ned banners.&lt;ref name=ZugHarvardMIT&gt;{{cite web|last=Hargrave |first=John |title=Harvard vs. MIT: Who Has the Better Sense of Humor? |url=http://www.zug.com/pranks/harvard-vs-mit/index.html |website=Zug: Prank You Very Much |publisher=Media Shower, Inc. |accessdate=2011-05-12 |author2=Mike Hoban |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104202203/http://www.zug.com/pranks/harvard-vs-mit/index.html |archivedate=January 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT hacks can push the limits of technical skill, and sometimes fail in spite of meticulous planning.  Even these engineering failures have been acknowledged to have educational value, and sometimes a follow-up attempt succeeds. One hack on the Great Dome is documented as having finally succeeded on the fourth try, after a complete re-engineering of both the installed artifact and the installation method.&lt;ref name=HackNippleBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork : a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=56–57|chapter=Domework: hacking the domes; Dome as dais; The great breast of knowledge, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller projects that can be completed by an individual student are sometimes accorded the honorific "a great hack" by other students, if they combine technical elegance with a hackish sense of humor.  For example, an MIT undergrad transformed an ordinary grocery [[shopping cart]] into a high-performance [[electric vehicle]], and had been frequently seen riding around campus in his "LOLrioKart".&lt;ref name=GizmodoKart&gt;{{cite web|last=Frucci|first=Adam|title=MIT Students Build a Speedy Go-Kart Out of a Shopping Cart|url=https://gizmodo.com/5303616/mit-students-build-a-speedy-go+kart-out-of-a-shopping-cart|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shopping cart had a claimed top speed over {{convert|45|mph}}, and also had a complex steering wheel linkage and a low [[Steering|turning radius]] for maneuverability in tight spaces.  The student was a strong advocate of the [[open-source hardware|Open Source Hardware]] philosophy, and incorporated detailed documentation of his projects and a tutorial on building custom [[wheel hub motor]]s in his blog.&lt;ref name=GuanBlog&gt;{{cite web|last=Guan|first=Charles Z|title=[Homepage]|url=http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/|website=Equals zero|publisher=etotheipiplusone.net|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ersatz vehicle was prominently displayed at many MIT events, as well as at the [[Cambridge Science Festival]].  As a crowning mark of recognition by the outside world, the LOLrioKart driver once received a traffic ticket from the Cambridge Police, a copy of which was proudly displayed online.&lt;ref name=TrafficTicket&gt;{{cite web|last=Guan|first=Charles Z|title=I Love Cambridge|url=http://miters.mit.edu/2009/08/30/i-love-cambridge/|website=MITERS [Blog]|publisher=MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS)|accessdate=2011-05-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225093506/http://miters.mit.edu/2009/08/30/i-love-cambridge/|archivedate=2011-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best large-scale hacks (e.g. the Caltech cannon heist) have involved multiple teams of hackers working on coordinated but diverse subtasks such as fund-raising, "[[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]]", [[Rigger (industry)|rigging]], [[logistics|transportation logistics]], [[electroplating|gold electroplating]], and precision [[numerical control|numerical controlled machining]], calling on a wide range of technical and management skills.&lt;ref name=CalCannon&gt;{{cite web|title=Caltech's Fleming Cannon transported to MIT|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2006/mitcannon/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not surprisingly, some hacker teams have gone on to found start-up business ventures, though they may be reluctant to reveal their earlier exploits until many years have passed.{{citation needed|date= April 2011}}

==Famous hacks==
One classic hack involved a police car with its flashing warning lights operating. The unusual aspect of this hack was its position — on top of MIT's Great Dome. The car was found to be a gutted, junked, heavy Chevrolet, painted meticulously to match the MIT Campus Police patrol cars. The car's number was [[pi]].  Its license plate read "[[#IHTFP|IHTFP]]", the abbreviation for MIT's unofficial slogan.  A dummy dressed as a campus patrolman was seated inside with mug of coffee and a box of donuts.&lt;ref name=CP-Car&gt;{{cite web|title=CP Car on the Great Dome|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1994/cp_car/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some years later, the police car has now been semi-permanently re-installed in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]] as an all-time classic.&lt;ref name="StataHacks"/&gt;

Due to MIT's proximity to Harvard, many hacks involve the annual [[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|Harvard-Yale]] [[American football|football]] game.  Because of the Cambridge rivalry between MIT and Harvard, hackers often are found at the games, and they have come up with some of the most famous hacks in the Institute's history.&lt;ref name=HackHarvardWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Hacks on Harvard|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_topic/harvard.html|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackHarvardBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

One such notable hack attempt targeting the 1948 Harvard-Yale football game&lt;ref name=HackHarvardBook1948&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork : a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|page=172|chapter=When MIT won the Harvard-Yale game: hacking Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved the use of [[detonating cord|primer cord]].  One night shortly before the game MIT students snuck into the Harvard stadium and buried primer cord just under the field.  The plan was to burn the letters MIT into the middle of the field during the game.  However, their work was uncovered by groundskeepers and disabled.  During the game the hackers were apprehended while wearing heavy coats on a fair-weather day.  The coats were lined with batteries, obviously intended to be used to detonate the primer cord.  An apocryphal story is that an MIT dean came to their defense, opening his own battery-lined coat and claiming that "all Tech men carry batteries"; an MIT dean did show up, but he was not wearing batteries.  This phrase has since become common among MIT students.

The Harvard-Yale football game was again the target of MIT hackers in 1982&lt;ref name=HackHarvardBook1982&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork : a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=172–176|chapter=When MIT won the Harvard-Yale game: hacking Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a large weather balloon painted with "MIT" all around was inflated, seemingly from nowhere, in the middle of the field.  The next day the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' ran the headline "MIT 1—Harvard-Yale 0: Tech Pranksters Steal the Show".  The 1982 Harvard-Yale hack earned acclaim as winner of "Hack Madness", a [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|March Madness]]-themed contest sponsored by the MIT Alumni Association in 2014 to determine "the greatest MIT hack of all time".&lt;ref name=HackMadness&gt;{{cite web|title=The Harvard-Yale Football Game is MIT Hack Madness Champion|url=https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/03/14/hack-champion/|year=2014|publisher=Slice of MIT|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue itself was sculpted by [[Daniel Chester French]], a respected artist who studied at MIT, who is best known for his statue of ''[[Abraham Lincoln (1920 statue)|Abraham Lincoln]]'' at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in [[Washington DC]].  Because of its visible location in [[Harvard Yard]] and its symbolic significance, the John Harvard statue has been fitted with an unending sequence of "[[fashion accessory|accessories]]".  MIT hackers are hardly alone; [[Dartmouth College]] pranksters like to paint the statue green, [[Yale]] pranksters prefer blue, and others have dressed the statue in women's underwear.

The cleverness of many MIT hacks has even resulted in [[urban legend]]s about supposed hacks that may not have occurred.  One rumored hack involved a certain student's adherence to [[classical conditioning]] behavior response, as studied by Harvard Professor [[B. F. Skinner]]. Throughout the off-season, this supposed student visited the Harvard football stadium during his lunch break. He dressed in a black and white striped shirt and trousers, filled his pockets with bird-seed, then went on the field, blew a whistle, and spread his birdseed on the field. The result of all of this effort, the story goes, is that on opening day as the Harvard football team took the field to face their opponent, the referee blew his whistle to signal the start of the game, and the field was suddenly inundated by a flock of birds looking for their lunch.  Despite sounding like a classic MIT hack, this particular prank has never been verified.  The author of a 1990 book about pranks pulled by MIT students stated that he had not come across clear documentation of this tale during his years of research.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081216214708/http://www.snopes.com/college/pranks/birdseed.asp Seeded Field Prank]. snopes.com.

On the other hand, at least one hack involved a staged event that never occurred, when hackers convinced major news media that they had created an indoor snowstorm in Baker House dormitory.&lt;ref name=BakerSnow&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Baker House Snow Hack|url=http://museum.mit.edu/nom150/entries/1446|website=MIT 150 Exhibition Nominations|publisher=MIT Museum|accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, hackers installed 153 (= 9 x 17) custom-made wirelessly-controlled color-changing high-power [[LED]] lights into every window above the first floor of the 295-foot (90 m) tall MIT [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]]. They displayed a waving [[American flag]] throughout the evening of September 11, 2011 in remembrance of the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001.  For a short time in the early morning of September 12, the lights displayed a [[Tetris]] game, thus realizing a long-standing hack proposal, the "[[Holy Grail]]" of hacks. The display hardware had occasional glitches, and was removed as of September 13. The hardware and software designs were further developed and refined for better reliability. On April 20, 2012, MIT hackers successfully turned the Green Building into a huge playable Tetris game, operated from a wireless control podium at a comfortable viewing distance in front of the building. Visitors to Campus Preview Weekend (a gathering for admitted prospective freshman students) were invited to play the game on the colossal display grid (80&amp;nbsp;ft. wide x 250&amp;nbsp;ft. high), which was claimed to be the second-largest full-color video display in the US.&lt;ref name=Pourian&gt;{{cite news|last=Pourian|first=Jessica J.|title=The 'holy grail' of hacks: The construction of one of the most anticipated hacks of all time|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N22/tetris.html|accessdate=2012-05-06|newspaper=The Tech|date=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Brock|title=Hackers convert MIT building in giant Tetris video game|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/cambridge/2012/04/hackers_convert_mit_building_i.html|accessdate=2012-05-06|newspaper=Boston.com|date=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackGalleryTetris&gt;{{cite web|title=Tetris on the Green Building|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2012/tetris/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|publisher=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of a one-shot temporary installation, the hackers have designed and built a permanent facility that can be re-used repeatedly by the MIT community. An understanding has been reached with the EAPS Department, which is headquartered in the Green Building, to allow the light display hardware to remain installed in each window.  To avoid annoying the occupants and to allow late-working staff to "opt out", each light display is equipped with a manual override button, which will disable the [[pixel]] lighting for that window for several hours after it is pressed. In addition, the hackers have released [[Open Source]] software tools used to develop new display patterns, so that others can design and deploy new stationary or animated images, in cooperation with the hacker engineers.&lt;ref name="Pourian"/&gt;

==IHTFP==
'''IHTFP'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihtfp.com/ihtfp.html |title=What is IHTFP? |website=Ihtfp.com |accessdate=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an abbreviation which is part of the folklore at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. It originally stood for "I Hate This Fucking Place" but, due to use of profanity, is often [[euphemism|euphemized]] with other [[backronym]]s. Some of the more popular meanings include "I Have The Fucking Power" (Hacking), "I Help Tutor Freshman Physics", "It's Hard To Fondle Penguins", "I'm Hankering To Find Paradise", and "Interesting Hacks To Fascinate People", as well as "I Have Truly Found Paradise", "Institute for Hacks, TomFoolery, and Pranks" and "Institute Has The Finest Professors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mit.edu/people/mjbauer/ihtfp.html |title=IHTFP |website=Mit.edu |accessdate=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIT leadership has even adapted the acronym, using it to encourage vaccination during the 2009–2010 flu season with a banner in the MIT medical building that read "I Hate This Flu Pandemic". The precise time of origin is unknown, though the term IHTFP was already widely used at MIT by 1960.

The letters "IHTFP" have been featured prominently on some hacks,&lt;ref name=IHTFP-Hack&gt;{{cite web|title=I Will Hate This F***ing Place|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2008/iwhtfp/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHTFP-Balloons&gt;{{cite web|title=IHTFP Balloons|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2003/ihtfp_balloons/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHTFP-GreatDome&gt;{{cite web|title=MCMXVI changed to IHTFP on Great Dome|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1995/ihtfp_dome/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHTFP-Flag&gt;{{cite web|title=I Hate The Flag Policy|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2004/flag_policy/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackIHTFPBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

A very common motif in the MIT [[MIT class ring|Brass Rat]] (class ring) prior to 2013 was the inclusion of the letters "IHTFP" hidden somewhere within the frame of the bezel.

==Caltech rivalry==
{{main|Caltech–MIT rivalry}}

MIT and [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] have been prank rivals since Spring 2005, when a group of Caltech students traveled to Cambridge to pull a string of pranks during "Campus Preview Weekend" (CPW) for prospective new MIT students.  The stunts included covering up the word "Massachusetts" in the "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" engraving on the main building façade with a banner, so that it read "That Other Institute of Technology". A group of MIT hackers quickly responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read "The Only Institute of Technology".&lt;ref name=HackCaltechBook&gt;
{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=8–13|chapter=Hacking into the new millennium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT students retaliated for CPW in April 2006, when students posing as the [http://www.howeandser.com/ "Howe &amp; Ser Moving Co."] abducted the 130-year-old, 1.7 ton Fleming House Cannon and moved it to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, thus reprising a similar prank performed by [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=HackCaltechBook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/04/19/comedy_on_campus_mit_takes_on_caltech_for_prank_distinction/ |title=Comedy on Campus: MIT takes on Caltech for prank distinction |date=April 19, 2006 |publisher=Boston Globe |first=Catherine |last=Elton}}&lt;/ref&gt; To add a technical flourish, a [[Carat (purity)|24K]] gold-plated precisely upscaled machined replica of the famed [[Brass Rat]] (MIT's graduation ring) was tightly fitted over the barrel of the cannon, which was carefully aimed in the direction of Caltech.&lt;ref name="CalCannon"/&gt; Twenty-three members of Caltech Fleming House traveled to MIT to reclaim their cannon on April 10, 2006. They were greeted by a larger group of MIT students, who offered them a [[barbecue|BBQ]] farewell party.  In exchange, the Caltech students offered a small toy cannon, saying that this was "more your size".

During MIT's CPW in 2007, Caltech distributed a complete fake edition of ''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]'' (MIT's student newspaper) with the headline article reading "MIT Invents the Interweb".  Another article announced the discovery, "Infinite Corridor Not Actually Infinite", referring to MIT's [[Infinite Corridor|iconic main thoroughfare]].  The edition included a mock weather forecast, referring often to how sunny [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] (where Caltech is located) is compared to [[Boston]], as well as other satirical articles.&lt;ref name="HackCaltechBook"/&gt;

In 2008, Caltech students provided a "Puzzle Zero" in the [[MIT Mystery Hunt]] which when solved, told solvers to "CALL 1-626-848-3780 ASAP". When MIT students dialed the number, they heard, "Thank you for calling the Caltech Admissions Office. If you are another MIT student wishing to transfer to Caltech, please download our transfer application form from www.caltech.edu. If you are an MIT student not wishing to transfer to Caltech, we wish you the best of luck, and hope you find happiness someday...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Harvey |title=Rub a dub dub, a suspect in a tub; Battle of the brains |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/columnists/la-me-only8-2008jun08,0,6914716.column |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=2008-06-08 |accessdate=2008-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around Thanksgiving weekend in 2009, yet another fake edition of ''The Tech'' was released, alleging that MIT had been sold to Caltech and would become "Caltech East: School of Humanities". Students would be required to take a core of literature, history, philosophy, and economics, but science subjects would be eliminated.&lt;ref name="HackCaltechBook"/&gt;

In the past few years, MIT hackers have tended to ignore Caltech "nuisance" pranks, instead preferring to perform more imaginatively engineered hacks on their own home campus.   In particular, the majority of documented hacks occurring during CPW have been perpetrated by MIT students themselves.&lt;ref name=CreativePeople&gt;{{cite web|title="Creative People with Words" items appear around campus|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2009/creative_people_with_words/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Annual&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Event Hacks [CPW]|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_topic/timing-dependent.html|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MIT hackers have only rarely interfered with Caltech traditions, rituals, or celebrations.  But some MIT hackers do occasionally engage in low-level "sniping" back and forth with Caltech pranksters.  For example, hackers made a website http://www.mitrejects.com redirect to Caltech's homepage.  Caltech then did the same, with https://web.archive.org/web/20110614193503/http://www.caltechrejects.com/ redirecting to the MIT homepage.

A possible change in attitude started when a [[TARDIS]], which hackers had placed on the MIT Little Dome (August 25, 2010) and the MIT Great Dome (August 30, 2010), was transported to the roof of Baxter Hall at Caltech (January 4, 2011) by MIT and Caltech pranksters, where it remained for several weeks.  The traveling time-machine subsequently reappeared atop Birge Hall at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (January 29, 2011), and then rematerialized on the Durand Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering Building at [[Stanford University]] (March 18, 2011).  The TARDIS came complete with a helpful note explaining how to disassemble it, and suggesting passing it on to other unexplored destinations.&lt;ref name=MIT-TARDIS&gt;

They were accompanied by posters that presented proposed renovations to add Simmons-like architectural elements (particularly the ones often regarded as useless by MIT students) to Caltech dormitories, which were undergoing renovation.
;April 6, 2006: A 130 year-old, 1.7 ton cannon was moved from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] to MIT via a fake moving company [http://www.howeandser.com/ "Howe &amp; Ser Moving Co."] This marked the 20th anniversary of when 11 students from nearby [[Harvey Mudd College]] removed the cannon from the front of the Fleming House.

;September 15, 2004: A small alcove in the [[Infinite Corridor]] was closed off by a painted wall with a door. Opening the door revealed a "room" inside, full of small shrubs or bushes, plus some painted and framed artwork.  An official-looking sign next to the door labeled it the "Vannevar Shrubbery Room", a parody of the nearby larger "Vannevar Bush Room", whose entrance location had recently been moved around the corner due to renovations.&lt;ref name=Shrubbery&gt;{{cite web|title=Vannevar Shrubbery Room|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2004/shrubbery/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous hacks===
;April 1, 1998: As an [[April Fools' Day|April Fool's Day]] prank, the MIT home page was replaced with a page announcing the university had been bought by [[The Walt Disney Company]] for [[United States dollar|$]]6.9 billion. The hacked page showed a picture of [[Mickey Mouse]] ears atop the Great Dome, and replaced the letter I in MIT with the lower-case "i" from Disney's [[wordmark]]. It even contained a fake press release with statements purportedly from Disney and MIT officials, detailing terms of the acquisition.&lt;ref name=MITDisney&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Disney buying MIT or was the MIT home page hacked?|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1998/disney_buys_mit/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;June 7, 1996: During a speech made by Vice-President [[Al Gore]] at the graduation ceremony, the graduates played [[Buzzword bingo]] using cards which had been distributed by hackers. The cards featured technical words which students believed were overused by people outside the technical professions, such as "[[information superhighway|Information Superhighway]]". Gore, who was informed of the hack, acknowledged it during his speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1996/gore/front_top.gif IHTFP Hacks Gallery: Al Gore Buzzword Bingo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908171413/http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1996/gore/front_top.gif |date=September 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;May 9, 1994: A carefully assembled outer frame of a car painted as an MIT Campus Police car appeared on top of the Great Dome. This hack quickly gained recognition on many local news sources and on national television.&lt;ref name="CP-Car"/&gt;
;December 9, 1991: It has been often said that "Getting an Education from MIT is like taking a drink from a Fire Hose", inspiring hackers to connect a real fire hose and a concrete-embedded [[fire hydrant]] to a drinking fountain in Building 16. Years later, the iconic monument has been semi-permanently re-installed by the MIT Museum in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]].&lt;ref name=FireHoseHack&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Hose Drinking Fountain

;October 31, 1979: A lifesize fiberglass cow appeared on top of the Great Dome. The cow was later installed by the MIT Museum in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]].
;November 1963: The first ever reference to malicious [[security hacker|hacking]] is '[[phreaking|telephone hackers]]' in MIT's student newspaper, ''The Tech'' of hackers trying up the lines with [[Harvard University|Harvard]], configuring the [[PDP-1]] to make free calls, [[war dialing]] and accumulating large phone bills.&lt;ref&gt;https://infostory.com/2011/11/20/hacking-and-blue-boxes/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/first-recorded-usage-of-hacker/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tech.mit.edu/V83/PDF/V83-N24.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
;October 1958: [[Oliver R. Smoot]], a pledge of MIT's [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity in 1958, was used to measure the length of the [[Harvard Bridge]]. As he lay on the sidewalk of the bridge that carries Massachusetts Avenue across the [[Charles River]], markings were made at intervals corresponding to his height. The bridge was measured to be 364.4 [[Smoot]]s (plus or minus one ear) in length.  During renovation of the bridge in 1964 the markings were carefully restored, and the markings remain to this day.
;1930s: Ken Wadleigh, who later in life became a dean at MIT, and 4 others welded a streetcar to metal rails by first distracting the [[motorman]] and then setting off [[thermite]] bombs to weld the wheels in place.&lt;ref name=trolleyHack&gt;{{cite web|title=Happy 60th Birthday to the Word "Hack"|url=http://slice.mit.edu/2015/04/06/happy-birthday-hack/|accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trolleyHack1&gt;{{cite web|title=From the Cathouse, an Editorial, by weasel, who isn't one|url=http://web.mit.edu/activities/voodoo/archive/pdfs/1968-Mar.pdf|website=Voodoo, Apr 1, 1968, p. 28|accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John (Jack) Cristopher Coleman''' (died 20 April 1971) was a respected [[Irish people|Irish]] [[geographer]], [[archaeologist]], [[speleologist]] and [[mountaineer]]. He devoted much of his life to the study of the caves of Ireland, the product of which were his many contributions to scientific journals in Ireland and the United Kingdom, his founding of the [[Speleological Union of Ireland|Speleological Society of Ireland]] and the publishing of his book, ''The Caves of Ireland''.

His dedication to the exploration of Irish caves and highly respected articles published both nationally and abroad were pivotal in boosting the study of speleology in Ireland during the mid to late 20th century, earning him the affectionate title of the "father of Irish caving".&lt;ref name=is20 /&gt;

==Life and caving exploits==
Coleman was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland and worked for [[Bord Fáilte]] from 1945,&lt;ref name=reyfadeer-obit&gt;{{cite journal| title=Obituary: Jack Coleman| editor1-last=Shiels| editor1-first=W.| editor2-last=Jones| editor2-first=G. Ll.| journal=The Reyfadeer: The Reyfad Group Journal| volume=1| year=1973| page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; having trained as a geographer in [[University College Cork|Cork University]]. He began caving in 1932,&lt;ref name=coleman-ubssireland&gt;{{cite journal| title=The society in Ireland| last=Coleman| first=J. C.| journal=[[Proceedings of the University of Bristol Spelæological Society]]| volume=12| issue=1| year=1969| pages=75–82| url=http://www.ubss.org.uk/resources/proceedings/vol12/UBSS_Proc_12_1_75-82.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially exploring caves within cycling distance of his home in Cork City such as [[Carrigtwohill Caves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Exploration of a new cave discovered at Carrigtwohill, Co. Cork| last=Coleman| first=J. C.| journal=Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society| series=2| volume=XXXIX| year=1934| pages=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ovens Caves. In 1940 Coleman met [[Portlaoise]] [[Polymer chemistry|textile chemist]] N. J. Dunnington, who joined him in explorations of caves in South Cork. In July 1941 the pair cycled heavily laden bicycles to [[County Clare]] to investigate [[Pollnagollum]],&lt;ref name=coleman-ubssireland /&gt; and over the ensuing years undertook a systematic exploration of the cave system. In 1944 the [[Royal Irish Academy]] published an article on the cave system by Coleman and Dunnington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Poulnagollum cave, Co. Clare| last1=Coleman| first1=J. C.| last2=Dunnington| first2=N. J.| journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy]]| volume=L| issue=B|date=October 1944| issn=0791-7945| pages=105–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; which received widespread praise from the scientific community and attracted a new wave of speleologists to [[the Burren]].&lt;ref name=coleman-ubssireland /&gt;

Coleman was the first speleologist to identify scalloping as an indicator of the direction of water flow in a cave. His findings, made between 1946 and 1949, were published by the [[University of Bristol Spelæological Society]] (UBSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=An indicator of water-flow in caves| last=Coleman| first=J.

By the 1960s he had been made Honorary Life Member of the UBSS.&lt;ref name=coleman-ubssireland /&gt;

Throughout the 1950s Coleman carried out much scientific fieldwork in areas such as Counties [[County Sligo|Sligo]], [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] and [[County Kerry|Kerry]],&lt;ref name=coleman-ubssireland /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Caves near Carrickmacross, County Monaghan| last=Coleman| first=J.

In 1964 Coleman founded the [[Speleological Union of Ireland|Speleological Society of Ireland]], the first representative body for cavers in Ireland. He was also the first editor of the Society's journal ''[[Irish Speleology]]''. Coleman published his work widely in a number of publications. His articles included work on [[Dunmore Cave]], Carrigtwohill Caves and Pollnagollum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Dunmore Cave, Co. Kilkenny| last1=Dunnington| first1=N.

Coleman was also a prominent member of the [[Irish Mountaineering Club]] and was president of the club from 1950–1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishmountaineeringclub.org/past-presidents/ |title=Past Presidents: Irish Mountaineering Club presidents through the years |publisher=Irish Mountaineering Club |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This case occurred in 1725, where Nicole Millet's husband was accused of burning her to death, but was acquitted after a surgeon named [[Nicholas le Cat]] convinced the court that her cause of death had been SHC.

Dupont was one of the first people to publish a reliable collection of evidence on SHC. His book made SHC a thing of popular interest and sparked people's imaginations around the world, including that of [[Charles Dickinson (writer)|Charles Dickens]], who used SHC in "Bleak House", one of his books, to kill off a character.

She was born and raised in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], living much of her adolescent life on the streets after being expelled from home. In her teens, Jones would [[freestyle rap]], heavily influenced by fellow female hip-hop artists like [[MC Lyte]] and [[The Lady of Rage]]. In 1994, she was discovered by fellow rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], who invited her to join his rap group [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]]; their debut album as a group, ''[[Conspiracy (Junior M.A.F.I.A. album)|Conspiracy]]'', generated two top 20 singles in the United States and was certified [[Gold certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]].

Lil' Kim's debut [[studio album]], ''[[Hard Core (Lil' Kim album)|Hard Core]]'' (1996), was certified double [[Platinum certification|platinum]] by the RIAA, has since sold more than 6 million copies worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/33734/1/why-lil-kim-s-hard-core-is-as-relevant-as-ever|title=Lil Kim - Music/Radio - Nairaland|last=Hall|first=Jake|accessdate=June 9, 2017|quote=Kim was, however, the first high-profile female rapper to flip the script on female objectification in the rap industry. She set herself apart by owning, weaponising, and celebrating her unapologetic sexuality.

Her following albums, ''[[The Notorious K.I.M.]]'' (2000) and ''[[La Bella Mafia]]'' (2003), were also certified platinum, making her the only female rapper besides [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Nicki Minaj]] to have at least three platinum-certified studio albums. In 2001, she was featured on the single "[[Lady Marmalade]]" (a [[cover version|remake]] of the [[Lady Marmalade|1975 hit single of the same name]], originally recorded by [[LaBelle]]), alongside [[Mýa]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], which went to number one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In addition, the remake won two [[MTV Video Music Awards]] including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]], and a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]] at the [[44th Grammy Awards]] in 2002. In 2005, she served a yearlong [[prison]] sentence for lying to a jury about her friends' involvement in a shooting four years earlier. During her incarceration, her fourth album, ''[[The Naked Truth (Lil' Kim album)|The Naked Truth]]'', was released to positive reviews from critics. She returned to the public eye in 2009 with an appearance on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''.

Throughout her career, Lil' Kim has sold more than 15 million albums and 30 million singles worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.networth2013.com/lil-kim-net-worth-in-2017/|title=Lil Kim Net Worth in 2017|date=2017-03-15|work=Net Worth, Bio, Wiki|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her songs "No Time", "Big Momma Thang", and "Ladies Night" were listed on [[Complex (magazine)|''Complex Magazine''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s]] list of the 50 Best Rap Songs By Women.&lt;ref name="The 50 Best Rap Songs by Women"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/04/the-50-best-rap-songs-by-women/|title=The 50 Best Rap Songs by Women|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Lil' Kim was listed on [[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Women In Music list at number 45, the second highest position for a solo female hip-hop artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Mark|title=The 100 Greatest Women In Music|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-02-13/100-greatest-women-in-music/57/|work=VH1|accessdate=August 4, 2013|date=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lil' Kim has been called "the fiercese, most provocative and most infamous female rapper" by [[AllMusic]],&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=lil-kim-mn0000278439}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the top 50 greatest MCs of all time in the book ''[[There's a God on the Mic]]''.

While still a teen, Jones met The Notorious B.I.G. a.k.a.

Hale Vocational High School for two and a half years. Many of her friends also went there and she would often skip school to hang out with them. Since her school work wasn't being completed, the decision was made for her to transfer to [[Brooklyn College Academy]] to finish her remaining year and half of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 2003|title=What I was like in High School – Lil' Kim: Always a style diva and trend setter|journal=[[YM (magazine)|YM]]|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the same school that fellow rappers [[Nas]] and [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]] also attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/56177|title=Brooklyn College Academy – Brooklyn, NY|work=PublicSchoolReview.com|accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, B.I.G. was instrumental in introducing and promoting the Brooklyn-based group, Junior M.A.F.I.A., which included Jones, who adopted the [[stage name]] Lil' Kim and was only 19 at the time.

== Controversies ==

=== Foxy Brown ===
Once high school friends, Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown originally remained close despite becoming associates of clashing hip-hop groups Junior M.A.F.I.A. and [[The Firm (hip hop group)|The Firm]], respectively.&lt;ref name="vibe"&gt;{{citation|last=Smith|first=Danyel|title=Foxy Brown Is the Illest|newspaper=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=December 1998|volume=6|issue=7|pages=113–114|issn=1070-4701}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, they collaborated with Da Brat for the remix of  "[[No One Else (Total song)|No One Else]]" by [[Total (group)|Total]]. The following year, they were featured in the Hot 97 NY Fashion Show,&lt;ref name="hot97"&gt;{{citation|last=Byrd|first=Kenya N.|title=In The Mix: The Queen Bee—Unwrapped|newspaper=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=March 1999|volume=7|issue=2|page=55|issn=1070-4701}}&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally appeared on the covers of ''The Source'' and ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]''.&lt;ref name="bet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gale|first=Alex|title=It Was All So Simple Then... &gt; Lil' Kim vs. Foxy Brown: A Brief History|url=http://www.bet.com/music/photos/2011/08/lil-kim-vs-foxy-brown-a-timeline.html#!081911-music-lil-kim-vs-foxy-brown-source|work=BET|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bitchie|first=Necole|title=Bitchie Throwback: Vibe Magazine's Rap Reign Supreme Cover &lt;nowiki&gt;[Feb 1998]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|url=http://necolebitchie.com/2011/01/26/bitchie-throwback-vibe-magazines-rap-reign-supreme-cover-feb-1998/|work=Necole Bitchie|date=January 26, 2011|accessdate=February 13, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411112159/http://necolebitchie.com/2011/01/26/bitchie-throwback-vibe-magazines-rap-reign-supreme-cover-feb-1998/|archivedate=April 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their first dispute developed after both of their debut studio albums were scheduled for release a week apart in November 1996.&lt;ref name="bet" /&gt; Media outlets additionally noted similarities between the sleeve covers of Lil' Kim' ''Hard Core'' and Brown's ''[[Ill Na Na]]'', where the two were shown wearing the same outfit.&lt;ref name="vibe2"&gt;{{citation|title=20 Questions|newspaper=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=March 1997|volume=5|issue=2|page=148|issn=1070-4701}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the feud led to the deterioration of their friendship, and also resulted in the cancellation of a collaborative album ''Thelma &amp; Louise''. Brown noted that the breakdown of their relationship was influenced by their conflicting entourages.&lt;ref name="vibe" /&gt; They first attempted a reconciliation in 1998 after Lil' Kim called Brown and her mother after the two were held at gunpoint during a house burglary.&lt;ref name="vibe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reiss|first=Randy|title=Rapper Foxy Brown Burglarized At Gunpoint|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/400435/foxy-browns-house-burglarized.jhtml|work=MTV News|date=July 9, 1998|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reiss|first=Randy|title=Cops Investigate ODB, Foxy Brown Armed Break-Ins|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/400466/odb-foxy-brown-break-ins-probed.jhtml|work=MTV News|date=July 10, 1998|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1999, critics noted the track "My Life" from Brown's second studio effort ''[[Chyna Doll (album)|Chyna Doll]]'' for being an "open appeal" to Brown's friendship with Lil' Kim, in which she cited the relationship being "lost for pride", but also contradicted herself after making attacks on "pointed mistresses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foxy Brown – My Life Lyrics|url=http://rapgenius.com/Foxy-brown-my-life-lyrics|work=Rap Genius|accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="villagevoice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Promis|first=Jose F.|title=''Chyna Doll'' – Foxy Brown|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/chyna-doll-mw0000600085|work=AllMusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics indicated the records were in subtle use to diss Lil' Kim, especially since during this time, Brown had been supporting Lil' Kim' rival [[Faith Evans]] in multiple interviews.&lt;ref name="villagevoice"&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonnell|first=Evelyn|title=Fox on the Run – Page 2|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1999-02-02/music/fox-on-the-run/2/|work=Village Voice|date=February 2, 1999|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1999, a significant part of the media took note of Brown "suddenly sound[ing] 'exactly' like Lil' Kim".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=20 Questions|newspaper=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=February 1999|volume=7|issue=1|page=146|issn=1070-4701}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late May 1999, [[Lil' Cease]]'s "[[Play Around]]", featuring Lil' Kim and Diddy, was released to radio airwaves and was set to be featured on Cease's debut ''[[The Wonderful World of Cease A Leo]]''.&lt;ref name="bet" /&gt; In the song, after Lil' Kim' guest rap, Diddy recites: "Stop trying to sound like her too bitches"; a subliminal diss aimed at Foxy.&lt;ref name="bet" /&gt; The line spurred enough controversy that various media sources went on to remark: "It's finally coming out.

Lil' Kim reignited the feud following the release of her mixtape ''Black Friday'', an album that directly referenced Nicki Minaj, via her debut album title and songs such as "[[Did It On'em]]" (that became "Pissin' On'em"); and with artwork that showed Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lil' Kim 'Black Friday' mixtape cover decapitates Nicki Minaj; rapper's old rival laughs off diss|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-02-16/entertainment/28622261_1_nicki-minaj-roman-s-revenge-radio-station|accessdate=August 21, 2012|location=New York|work=Daily News|date=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fragment of Minaj's [[diss track]] "Tragedy" was released online in April 2011, featuring lyrics "Pink Friday, Eminem, 8 Mile/ It must hurt to sell your album on PayPal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music Nicki Minaj aims new diss at "tragic" Lil' Kim|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a312696/nicki-minaj-aims-new-diss-at-tragic-lil-kim.html|work=DigitalSpy|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of Minaj's second album, ''Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded'', critics suggested that the tracks "[[Stupid Hoe]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lil Kim Addresses Nicki Minaj's 'Stupid Hoe'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/504896/lil-kim-addresses-nicki-minajs-stupid-hoe-single|work=Billboard|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have contained attacks at Lil' Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with ''105's Breakfast Club'' that the song "[[Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded|Automatic]]" from Minaj's second album was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj "obnoxious" and "catty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj 'A Very Obnoxious Person,' Lil' Kim Says|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685303/lil-kim-nicki-minaj-power-105.jhtml|work=MTV|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a partial '''list of people''' who have been categorized as '''[[Christ myth theory]]''' proponents, the belief that "the [[historical Jesus]] did not exist. Or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D]]. (2012). ''[[Did Jesus Exist? (Ehrman)|Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth]]''. HarperOne. {{ISBN|978-0062206442}} pp. 12, 347, n. 1. "[Per Jesus mythicism] In a recent exhaustive elaboration of the position, one of the leading proponents of Jesus mythicism, Earl Doherty, defines the view as follows: it is “the theory that no historical Jesus worthy of the name existed, that Christianity began with a belief in a spiritual, mythical figure, that the Gospels are essentially allegory and fiction, and that no single identifiable person lay at the root of the Galilean preaching tradition.” [Jesus: Neither God nor Man: The Case for a mythical Jesus (Ottawa, ON: Age of Reason Publications, 2009), vii–viii.] In simpler terms, the historical Jesus did not exist. Or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity."&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[Homosexuality and Judaism|LGBT Jew]]s. Each person is both [[Jewish]] (by ancestry or conversion) and has stated publicly that they are [[asexuality|asexual]],  [[bisexual]], [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[pansexual]], [[transgender]], and/or [[queer]] or [[questioning (sexuality)|questioning]] ([[LGBTQ]]), or identify as a member of the LGBTQ community. Being both Jewish and LGBTQ is a canonical (recognized) example of some facet of each person on this list, such that the below listed person's fame or significance flows from being both Jewish and LGBTQ.

In ''Queer Theory and the Jewish Question'', editors Daniel Boyarin, Daniel Itzkovitz, and Ann Pellegrini explain:
{{quote|While there are no simple equations between Jewish and queer identities, Jewishness and queerness yet utilize and are bound up with one another in particularly resonant ways. This crossover also extends to the modern discourses of [[antisemitism]] and [[homophobia]], with stereotypes of the Jew frequently underwriting pop cultural and scientific notions of the homosexual. And vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Queer Theory and the Jewish Question|year=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn= 9780231113748|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTvhHUXcH14C|editor1=Daniel Boyarin |editor2=Daniel Itzkovitz |editor3=Ann Pellegrini |accessdate=7 August 2012|chapter=Strange Bedfellows: An Introduction|quote=While there are no simple equations between Jewish and queer identities, Jewishness and queerness yet utilize and are bound up with one another in particularly resonant ways.

And vice versa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!-- PLEASE Do NOT add names to this list unless they already have Wikipedia articles, or could reasonably be expected to be the subject of an article or article section.

'''Maggie Axe Wachacha''' (1892–1993)  was an [[Eastern Band Cherokee]] woman renowned for reinvigorating Cherokee culture and [[ethnobotany]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eastern Band Cherokee Women: Cultural Persistence in Their Letters and Speeches|last=Carney|first=Virginia Moore|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-57233-332-1|location=|pages=129|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Tribal records, she was the daughter of Will and Caroline Cornsilk Axe.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wise Women: From Pocahontas to Sarah Winnemucca, Remarkable Stories of Native American Trailblazers|last=Turner|first=Erin|publisher=Morris Book Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7627-5538-7|location=Guilford, Connecticut|pages=33–40|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beloved Woman ==
In Cherokee culture, a beloved woman is someone who has a lot of influence in the tribe, speaks in tribal meetings, and corresponds with Beloved Women from other indigenous nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=MariJo|date=December 1998|title=Cherokee Beloved Woman|journal=News from Indian Country|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wachacha was honored as a Beloved Woman by the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] and [[Cherokee Nation]] in 2001 for her work as a clerk in the tribal council, and she was the second woman to be honored in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Indian Religious Traditions|last=|first=|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|isbn=978-1-57607-517-3|location=|pages=74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received the North Carolina Distinguished woman awarded from Governor Jim Martin in 1986.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Notable North Carolina women|last=Ravi|first=Jennifer|publisher=Bandit Books|year=1992|isbn=978-1-878177-03-2|location=Winston-Salem|pages=132–135|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of five to win the award out of the 91 nominated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Early life ==
Wachacha was born and raised in Snowbird Gap in [[Graham County, North Carolina]]. Her home was rather isolated in comparison to where the majority of other Cherokee people lived which was about 50 miles away from the [[Qualla Boundary]] of [[Swain County, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In Wachacha's youth, European-Americans made many efforts to assimilate Cherokee people into mainstream culture. These efforts led to her going to Christian church every Sunday. Wachacha learned that "the mountains and the valleys were not formed by the Great buzzards wings but by God." Wachacha liked learning about the Bible, the stories in it, and  Jesus, but this did not stop her from feeling connected to Cherokee culture. [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] was the language spoken in Wachacha's home while growing up. Additionally, Wachacha taught herself to read and write in Cherokee at the age of seven using chalk and writing in the dirt. Moreover, Wachacha attended an English speaking school for four months out of the year until she reached the fourth grade. According to anthropologist Sharlotte Nealy, white teachers and boarding schools were forced on the Cherokee people in order to weaken and eliminate Cherokee culture while promoting American culture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Wachacha's grandson remembers Wachacha talking about her elder's experiences with the Trail of Tears. Not many Cherokee people wrote about this horrific journey; but nonetheless, this did not erase the [[Trail of Tears]] from the Cherokee historical memory through word of mouth. Wachacha's ancestors were some of the few Cherokee that were able to remain in North Carolina and avoid [[Indian removal|forced removal]] to [[Indian Territory]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Wachacha was a clerk for the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] Tribal Council for nearly 50 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She began her tenure as clerk in 1937. There has been no evidence that Wachacha left behind any published works outside of the minutes she wrote as a clerk. Wachacha spoke Cherokee, and there are conflicting accounts as to whether or not she spoke English. Wachacha taught a Cherokee Indian class at Zion Hill Baptist Church. Along with teaching at the Zion Hill Baptist Church, she taught Cherokee culture and language at Robbinsville school system, Tri-County Technical College, and Adult Education Program of Graham County.

Wachacha was also known for her skills in being a midwife, herbalist, translator, and public speaker. Over the course of her life as a midwife, Wachacha helped deliver over 3,000 babies. To relieve pain, Wachacha would give mothers in labor tea from the inner bark of the wild black cherry. She regularly walked great distances to help any woman that was in need of her services.

As a part of Cherokee council member and Beloved Woman, Wachacha attended Cherokee singing ceremonies wearing the customary red Cherokee woman's handkerchief. This singing was the annual Trail of Tears Singing which was incorporated by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians from the Western Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. The Trail of Tears Singing was used to create solidarity between the Cherokee Bands and foster ideals of Cherokee traits and identity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Snowbird Cherokees: people of persistence|last=Neely|first=Sharlotte|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0-8203-1327-6|location=Athens|pages=115, 118, 119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Maggie met and married Jarrett Wachacha in 1935.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Jarrett was 20 years older than Maggie, and he was a member of the Deer Clan. Maggie and Jarrett had their first child, Winona, in 1936.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Michael Bishop''' is a fictional character of [[The CW Television Network|the CW]] television series ''[[Nikita (TV series)|Nikita]]'', portrayed by [[Shane West]]. He is the primary romantic interest to [[Nikita Mears|Nikita]].

==History==
Little is actually known about his past; but flashbacks show Michael was originally a [[U.S. Navy]] intelligence officer (although Season 1 episode "Covenant" depicts him in Marine uniform), working primarily in the United Arab Emirates. He was also a dedicated family man; with a wife, Elizabeth, and young daughter, Hayley.

In 2001, while in [[Yemen]], Iraq; Michael was running a "low-level snitch"; Kasim Tariq, who was feeding Michael information from inside [[Al-Qaeda]], and was on friendly terms with him. Kasim attempted to kill him with a car bomb placed in a briefcase, supposedly filled with stolen documents, that was in Michael's car. Instead, Michael stepped outside, leaving the briefcase in the car with his family, and realized too late Kasim had betrayed him – the bomb detonated and the car exploded; instantly killing Elizabeth and Hayley, but Michael, unharmed, was knocked out by the blast.

No sooner had he regained consciousness after the incident, Michael, recovering in a hospital bed and emotionally destroyed by the loss of his family, immediately attempted suicide with pain medication – Percy Rose, however, enters and recruited him into Division; hoping Division will assist him in locating Kasim and Michael would get an opportunity to get revenge. Michael accepted and was given the position as second-in-command and head of agent operations at Division; this cemented the relationship between Percy and Michael.&lt;ref name="One Way"/&gt; Michael almost achieved this in "One Way", Michael plans to stab Tariq with a [[shiv (weapon)|shiv]] in a public airport after assistance from Nikita, unbeknownst to her. Nikita foils this plan to save his own life.

In 2011, Michael finally joined Nikita and her cause after finding out the true reasons behind the death of his family – Kasim only posed as a snitch, and was truly an NOC Division agent; the death of his family was actually due to Percy, the man who saved his life, who had persuaded Kasim that Michael would be an ideal target to gain the approval from Al-Qaeda. Kasim was then killed by Nikita. Upon learning this, Michael, his faith in everything except his feelings for Nikita shattered, joins Nikita's growing anti-Division team – they also succumb to their feelings and become lovers. Together, he continues with them on her mission to search of a way to bring down Division.

==Character storylines==
At the start of the story arc concerning Tariq, Michael originally believes that they were killed by Tariq so that he could enter [[Al Qaeda]], having been told so by Percy. Percy and Michael met as Michael was trying to commit [[suicide]],&lt;ref name="One Way"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=One Way |series=Nikita|season=1 |seriesno= |number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; by an [[overdose]] of [[morphine]], but is stopped by Percy, who instead persuades him to join him at Division.
Michael then agrees, and takes up the position of a high-ranking agent due to his military training. He receives the job of greeting new recruits, processing them when they are first taken out of [[prison]].&lt;ref name="Pilot"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Pilot |series=Nikita|airdate=September 9, 2010 |season=1 |seriesno= |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He meets both [[Nikita Mears|Nikita]] and [[Alex (Nikita)|Alex]] this way.&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; Michael discovers that the death of his family was actually due to the man who saved his life (Percy), who persuaded Tariq that Michael would be an ideal target to gain the approval from [[Al-Qaeda]]. Upon learning this, Michael joins [[Nikita Mears|Nikita]] in her search for Percy's secret-containing black boxes.&lt;ref name="Covenants"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Covenants |series=Nikita|season=1 |seriesno= |number=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships and personality==
{{Quote box
 | quote  = "It seems like he felt human with [[Nikita Mears|her]], but robotic with everyone else."

}}
Michael is introverted in his relationships and is shown to have a closer circle of associates than the other agents. He is, however, shown to be friends with the likes of Seymour Birkhoff and [[Alex (Nikita)|Alex]].

Concerning his relationship with Nikita, he seems to not completely understand her intentions (both past and present) when they work together. It is ambiguous to Michael as to why Nikita acted the way she did in saving him from being killed by Kasim Tariq's bodyguards.
In the episode "Alexandra", he questions her about it, claiming that had she never acted he could have gained revenge and expresses anger that she did so,&lt;ref name="One Way"/&gt; to which Nikita retaliates with, "What I did I did out of..." before trailing off (the implication being that she was going to say she did it out of love).  Then, when Michael looks at her oddly, she finishes, "not wanting to see you get hurt." In the episode "Covenants", Michael leaves Division and joins Nikita. The two have since become romantically involved. In episode "Looking Glass", it is learned that Michael fathered a son with Cassandra (played by [[Helena Mattsson]]).

Michael was also in charge of processing new recruits, and telling them that they have been taken out of prison and been given a new life by Division. He breaks the news to Alex in the first episode, telling her that the public now will believe her to have committed suicide in prison. As a field agent, he played a similar role to that of Amanda, who were both high-ranking yet with some psychological leanings in their positions.
It is also heavily implied that everyone, even Amanda and Percy, in Division know of Michael's implied affair with Nikita. Both Amanda and Percy have mentioned this to him, Percy rather more bluntly and Amanda stating that "Percy doesn't need to know everything that goes on here."

He also has a platonic relationship with Alex, who is first processed into Division by Michael in the pilot episode, and he instructs her on the training she will receive, thus learning how to properly "serve her country". This reflects six years prior, when he instructed Nikita of the same duties. Alex's similarity to Nikita leads Michael to be more protective of her. He later finds out that she is Nikita's mole by matching the sounds of her phone calls to him to the echoes produced by Nikita's [[apartment]].&lt;ref name="Echoes"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Echoes |series=Nikita|airdate=February 24, 2011 |season=1 |seriesno= |number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is how he is able to track Nikita down. Alex, Nikita and Michael work together to track down Percy's black boxes for a very brief length of time towards the end of the first season, Nikita often in this time asking Michael to help Alex out of sticky situations at Divisions that may compromise his cover by doing so.

==Reception==
As was the character of Nikita as portrayed by [[Maggie Q]], the character of Michael was highly anticipated by fans who had previously watched ''[[La Femme Nikita]]''. Part of this anticipation balanced on the idea of Michael and Nikita's romantic relationship (as had been portrayed in most former incarnations of the tale) and if [[Shane West|West]] and Q possessed a good enough chemistry to play the two.

The character was well received by critics in his own right, yet not as well received by fans of [[Roy Dupuis|Roy Dupuis']] Michael in  ''[[La Femme Nikita]]''. West stated that, concerning Dupuis, he "always actually liked his work" as well as having also been a fan of the original [[USA Network]] ''[[La Femme Nikita]]'' television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daemonstv.com/2010/09/03/exclusive-shane-west-interview-on-nikita-cw/ |title='Shane West Interview with Daemon's TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of this, the character was generally well received, and West was even more praised for his performance as the first season continued.

West won the [[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Award]] for "Choice TV Actor Action" in 2011.

'''Milbourne Christopher''' (23 March 1914 – 17 June 1984) was a prominent American [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]], magic historian, and author.

President of the [[Society of American Magicians]], an honorary vice-president to [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]], and one of the founding members of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]], Christopher wrote a number of books, including a biography of [[Harry Houdini]] titled ''Houdini: The Untold Story,'' a chronicle of his own craft titled ''The Illustrated History Of Magic,'' and thousands of essays relating to magic and [[mentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hövelmann. Gerd H; [[Marcello Truzzi|Truzzi, Marcello]]; [[Piet Hein Hoebens|Hoebens, Piet Hein]]. (1985). ''Skeptical Literature on Parapsychology: An Annotated Bibliography''. In [[Paul Kurtz]]. ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 449-490. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debunking work ==

Christopher regarded those individuals who claimed [[extrasensory perception]] or [[psychic]] powers to be actually using magic trickery. He wrote three book-length exposés regarding those he said were false seers or psychics: ''ESP, Seers &amp; Psychics;'' ''Mediums, Mystics, &amp; The Occult;'' and ''Search For The Soul.'' In the latter book he found no evidence for the existence of the [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/milbourne-christopher-2/search-for-the-soul/ "Search for the Soul"]. Kirkus Reviews.&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] who was influenced by Christopher recommended the books "without reservation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/celebrating_milbourne_christopher/ "Celebrating Milbourne Christopher"]. Retrieved 16 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher also debunked [[parapsychology]] experiments and experimenters during his lifetime. Ironically, despite his denial of the existence of psychic or paranormal powers, and like fellow magicians [[Harry Houdini]] and [[James Randi]], both of whom also worked to expose false psychics and mediums, Christopher was accused by some of using paranormal powers to perform his own magic tricks and illusions.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, Milbourne. (1975). ''Mediums, Mystics &amp; The Occult''. New York: Crowell. p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

== Posthumous achievements ==

In November 2010, Christopher's widow, Maurine Brooks Christopher, published a special edition of ''Houdini: A Pictorial Life'' with Christopher Collection curator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/11/houdini-pictorial-life-collectors.html "Houdini A Pictorial Life Collector's Edition"]. Retrieved 16 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting of the executive council of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] in April 2011, Christopher was selected for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics.  The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheon of Skeptics|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|website=CSI|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131054129/http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|archivedate=31 January 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the book ''Milbourne Christopher: The Man &amp; His Magic,'' was authored by William V. Rauscher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnmagic.com/books/christopher.htm Milbourne Christopher: The Man and His Magic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220191755/http://www.nnmagic.com/books/christopher.htm |date=2014-12-20 }}. Retrieved 16 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Milbourne Christopher Foundation was established to encourage excellence, originality and leadership in the magical arts and to help keep conjuring on a level with the other most popular entertainment forms – dance, drama, comedy and music. Incorporated in New York State in 1991, the foundation is federally approved as a charitable organization which was financially supported in the past, and so too will be in the future, through her contributions. The board members have changed through the years, as have several of the award judges. Both the officers and award judges donate their services to the foundation.

It was Mrs. Christopher wish, and the purpose of the foundation, to sponsor annual awards that spotlight the best magic has to offer contemporaneously in performing, writing, publishing and invention. The categories reflect Milbourne Christopher’s diversified career. This includes the areas of

Author and/or publisher
Outstanding illusionist and/or illusion creator
Promising young magician
Mentalist
Lifetime achievement/master’s award
Ambassador of Magic

Winners in other areas may be added at the discretion of the judges and not all winner categories are awarded each year. The charter also authorizes the use of the foundation’s resources to keep classic books of magic – such as Christopher’s “Illustrated History of Magic”, “Panorama of Magic” and his biographies of Houdini.

'''Pyotr Zakharovich Zakharov-Chechenets''' ({{lang-ru|Пётр Захарович Захаров-Чеченец}}; 1816 – 1846) was a [[Russia]]n painter of [[Chechen people|Chechen]] origin. He is believed to be the only professional painter of Chechen origin in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="stranaru"&gt;[http://kavkaz.strana.ru/catalogue/culture/88148.html Grozny Art Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425195247/http://kavkaz.strana.ru/catalogue/culture/88148.html |date=2007-04-25 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chechenorg"&gt;[http://www.chechen.org/modules.php?name=Known&amp;letter=%C7&amp;sortby=cname Biography of famous Chechens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405054406/http://www.chechen.org/modules.php?name=Known |date=2007-04-05 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
In 1819, during the [[Caucasian War]] Russian troops found a dead woman and a dying wounded three-year-old baby in the Chechen [[aul]] Dady-Yurt. The [[commander-in-chief]] of the Russian army [[Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov]] ordered military medics to do everything possible to save this baby despite all medical advice saying that it was impossible. Against all the odds, the baby survived.&lt;ref name="ruhist"&gt;[http://www.sgu.ru/rus_hist/authors/?aid=665 Article P.Zakharov on the ''Russian History in the mirror of visual arts'' site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227102638/http://www.sgu.ru/rus_hist/authors/?aid=665 |date=2007-02-27 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baby was given for nursing to [[Cossack]] Zakhar Nedonosov.  From the name of this Cossack, the baby got his surname and [[patronymic]].&lt;ref name="freechechen"&gt;[http://www.chechnyafree.ru/index.php?lng=rus&amp;section=fcultrus&amp;row=5 ''Zakharov-Chechenets'' article on the ''Chechen Cultural Figures'' site]&lt;/ref&gt; Later Pyotr appended the word Chechenets to his surname in order to show his ethnic identity.

At the age of seven, Pyotr was adopted by [[Major-General]] Pyotr Yermolov, Commanger of a [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n [[Grenadier]] regiment and a cousin of Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov.&lt;ref name="ruhist"/&gt; Pyotr Yermolov liked Zakharov very much and, despite having seven children of his own, treated him as his own son.&lt;ref name="chechenorg"/&gt;

The boy showed talent in painting and Pyotr Yermolov tried to send him to the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] but the president of the Academy, [[Aleksey Olenin]], claimed that the 10-year-old boy was too young to study at the Academy and recommended hiring a private teacher. So, the boy got lessons from the portraitist Lev Volkov.

Eventually, at the age of 17, Zakharov entered the Academy. He graduated in 1835 with a diploma of ''Free Artist'' and was recommended for a scholarship to study art in Italy. The trip might have been helpful for both his artistic growth and for his health, which had begun to show signs of [[tuberculosis]]. However, his name was withdrawn from the list for the scholarship by Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia]] who insisted that [[national minorities]] (''[[inorodtsy]]'') should not benefit from the Academy's scholarships.&lt;ref name="freechechen"/&gt; Another misfortune followed as Zakarov's first teacher, Lev Volkov, refused to allow his daughter to marry Zakharov despite the young people being in love. Instead Volkov had her sent to relatives in the Caucasus with an order to marry her off to any first-comer just to stop the affair.&lt;ref name="freechechen"/&gt;

Zakharov soon became a fashionable portraitist. His clients included the favorite daughter of Nicholas I, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna, Duchess of Leuchtenberg|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna]] and her future husband [[Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg]].&lt;ref name="ruhist"/&gt; In 1837, he was admitted to the state service as an Artist in the Military Department.&lt;ref name="ruhist"/&gt; In 1842, his [[:Image:Zkharov-Yermolov.jpg|Portrait of Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov]] qualified him to become a member of the Academy of Arts.&lt;ref name="Brockhaus"&gt;[http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/041/41358.htm ''Pyotr Zakharov'']{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in the [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 1846, Zakharov married, &lt;!-- No idea if it was Miss Volkov or somebody else --&gt; but their happiness was short. On 13 June 1846, his wife died from tuberculosis.Zakharov died from the same disease a few months later.&lt;ref name="ruhist"/&gt;

Many works of Zakharov-Chechenets are kept in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and in the [[Russian Museum]]. The Art Museum in the capital of [[Chechnya]], [[Grozny]] also used to have many of his works including his ''Selfportrait, and ''Portrait of I.F. Ladygensky''. In 1995 during the [[First Chechen War]] the Grozny Museum was heavily damaged and the paintings were all but destroyed. Since 1995, they are being restored at the ''Grabar Restoration Center'' in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="stranaru"/&gt;

'''Saul''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɔː|l}}; {{hebrew Name|שָׁאוּל|Ša’ul|Šā’ul}}, meaning "asked for, prayed for"; {{lang-la|Saul}}; {{lang-ar|طالوت}}, ''[[Talut|Ṭālūt]]'' or {{lang|ar|شاؤل}}, ''Ša'ūl''), according to the [[Hebrew Bible]], was the first king of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel and Judah]]. His reign, traditionally placed in the late 11th century BCE,{{r|finkelstein}} marked a transition from a [[Tribe|tribal]] society to [[State (polity)|statehood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Saul and the rise of Israelite state religion |first=Karel |last=Van der Toorn |authorlink=Karel van der Toorn |year=1993 |journal=Vetus Testamentum |volume=XLIII |issue=4 |jstor=1518499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saul's life and reign are described in the Hebrew Bible. He was anointed by the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] and reigned from [[Gibeah]]. He [[fell on his sword]] (committing [[suicide]]) to avoid capture in the battle against the [[Philistines]] at [[Mount Gilboa]], during which three of his sons were also killed. The succession to his throne was contested by [[Ish-bosheth]], his only surviving son, and his son-in-law [[David]], who eventually prevailed. A similar yet different account of Saul's life may be given in the [[Quran]]. Neither the length of Saul's reign, nor the extent of his territory are given in the Hebrew Bible; the former is traditionally fixed at twenty or twenty-two years, but there is no reliable evidence for these numbers.{{r|finkelstein}}

==Biblical account==
The biblical accounts of Saul's life are found in the [[Books of Samuel]]:

===House of King Saul===
According to the [[Tanakh]], Saul was the son of [[Kish (Bible)|Kish]], of the family of the Matrites, and a member of the [[tribe of Benjamin]], one of the twelve [[Tribes of Israel]]. It appears that he came from [[Gibeah]].{{r|je}}
[[File:Julius Kronberg David och Saul 1885.jpg|thumb|right|''David and Saul'' (1885) by [[Julius Kronberg]].]]

Saul married [[Ahinoam]], daughter of [[Ahimaaz]], with whom he sired four sons ([[Jonathan (Samuel)|Jonathan]], [[Abinadab]], [[Malchishua]] and [[Ish-bosheth]]) and two daughters ([[Merab]] and [[Michal]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|14:51|HE}} lists three sons – Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchi-shua – and the two daughters. But see also {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|2:8|HE}} and {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|8:33|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saul also had a [[concubine]] named [[Rizpah]], daughter of [[Aiah]], who bore him two sons, [[Armoni and Mephibosheth]]. ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|21:8|HE}}).

Saul died at the Battle of [[Mount Gilboa]] ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|31:3–6|HE}}; {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|10:3–6|HE}}), and was buried in [[Zelah, Judea|Zelah]], in the region of [[Tribe of Benjamin#Territory|Benjamin]] ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|21:14|HE}}). Three of Saul's sons – Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua – died with him at Mount Gilboa ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|31:2|HE}}; {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|10:2|HE}}). [[Ish-bosheth]] became [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|king of Israel]], at the age of forty. At David's request Abner had Michal returned to David. Ish-bosheth reigned for two years, but after the death of Abner, was killed by two of his own captains ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|4:5|HE}}).

Armoni and Mephibosheth (Saul's sons with his concubine, Rizpah) were given by David along with the five sons of Merab (Saul's daughter)&lt;ref&gt;Some Hebrew versions say that the five sons were Michal's – e.g., {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|21:8–9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Gibeonites]], who killed them. ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|21:8–9|NIV}}) Michal was childless ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|6:23|HE}}).

The only male descendant of Saul to survive was [[Mephibosheth]], Jonathan's lame son ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|4:4|HE}}), who was five years old at the time of his father's and grandfather's deaths. In time, he came under the protection of David ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|9:7–13|HE}}). Mephibosheth had a young son, Micah ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|9:12|HE}}), who had four sons and descendants named until the ninth generation ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|8:35–38|HE}}).

===Anointed as king===
[[File:Elie Marcuse saul.jpg|400ox|thumb|right|"Death of King Saul", 1848 by [[Elie Marcuse]] (Germany and France, 1817–1902)]]
The First Book of Samuel gives three accounts of Saul's rise to the throne in three successive chapters:

*Saul is sent with a servant to look for his father's strayed donkeys. Leaving his home at [[Gibeah]], they eventually arrive at the district of [[Zuph]], at which point Saul suggests abandoning their search. Saul's servant tells him that they happen to be near the town of [[Ramathaim-Zophim|Ramah]], where a famous ''seer'' is located, and suggests that they should consult him first. The ''seer'' (later identified by the text as Samuel) offers hospitality to Saul and later [[anointing|anoints]] him in private (1 Samuel 9).&lt;ref name=driscoll&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13486d.htm|author=Driscoll, James F. |title=Saul |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |volume=13 |location=New York|publisher=Robert Appleton Company |date=1912 |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A popular movement having arisen to establish a centralized monarchy like other nations, Samuel assembles the people at [[Mizpah in Benjamin]] to appoint a king, fulfilling his previous promise to do so (1 Samuel 8). Samuel organises the people by [[Twelve Tribes of Israel|tribe]] and by clan. Using the [[Urim and Thummim]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/10.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on 1 Samuel 10], accessed 1 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; he selects the [[tribe of Benjamin]], from within the tribe selecting the clan of [[Matri (biblical figure)|Matri]], and from them selecting Saul. After having been chosen as monarch, Saul returns to his home in Gibeah, along with a number of followers (1 Samuel 10:17-24).&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;  However, some of the people are openly unhappy with the selection of Saul.
*The [[Ammon]]ites, led by [[Nahash of Ammon|Nahash]], lay siege to [[Jabesh-Gilead]]. Under the terms of surrender, the occupants of the city are to be forced into slavery and have their right eyes removed. Instead they send word of this to the other [[tribes of Israel]], and the tribes west of the Jordan assemble an army under Saul. Saul leads the army to victory over the Ammonites, and the people congregate at [[Gilgal]] where they acclaim Saul as king and he is crowned (1 Samuel 11).&lt;ref name=driscoll/&gt;  Saul's first act is to forbid retribution against those who had previously contested his kingship.

[[André Lemaire]] finds the third account probably the most reliable tradition.&lt;ref name=Lemaire&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/king-saul/ "King Saul", ''Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple'', (Hershel Shanks, ed.), Biblical Archaeology Society]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pulpit Commentary]] distinguishes between a private and a public selection process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm Pulpit Commentary on 1 Samuel 10], accessed 1 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saul among the prophets===
Having been anointed by Samuel, Saul is told of signs indicating that he has been divinely appointed. The last of these is that Saul will be met by an ecstatic group of prophets leaving a ''high place'' and playing the [[lyre]], [[tambourine]], and [[flute]]s. Saul encounters the ecstatic prophets and joins them.&lt;ref name=chabad&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/463971/jewish/Saul-First-King-of-Israel.htm "Saul, First King of Israel", Chabad.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Saul sends men to pursue David, but when they meet a group of ecstatic prophets playing music, they become possessed by a ''prophetic state'' and join in. Saul sends more men, but they too join the prophets. Eventually Saul himself goes, and also joins the prophets. ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|19:24|HE}}).

===Military victories===
After relieving the siege of Jabesh-Gilead, Saul conducts military campaigns against the [[Moabites]], [[Ammon]]ites, [[Edomites]], [[Aram Rehob]] and the kings of [[Zobah]], the [[Philistines]], and the [[Amalekites]] ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|14:47|NKJV}}).&lt;ref name="je"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Joseph |last1=Jacobs |first2=Ira Maurice |last2=Price |first3=Isidore |last3=Singer |first4=Jacob Zallel |last4=Lauterbach |title=Saul |encyclopedia=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |year=1906 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13224-saul}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biblical summary states that "wherever he turned, he was victorious".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|14:47|NLT}}: [[New Living Translation]]; other translations vary&lt;/ref&gt;

In his continuing battles with Philistines, Saul instructs his armies, by a rash oath, to fast. [[Methodism|Methodist]] commentator [[Joseph Benson]] suggests that "Saul’s intention in putting this oath was undoubtedly to save time, lest the Philistines should gain ground of them in their flight. But the event showed it was a false policy; for the people were so faint and weak for want of food, that they were less able to follow and slay the Philistines than if they had stopped to take a moderate refreshment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/14.htm Benson Commentary on 1 Samuel 14], accessed 7 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan's party were not aware of the oath and ate [[honey]], resulting in Jonathan realising that he had broken an oath of which he was not aware, but was nevertheless liable for its breach, until popular intervention allowed Jonathan to be saved from death on account of his victory over the Philistines.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|14:24-45|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection===
[[File:Witch of Endor. Dore 1866.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Saul and the [[Witch of Endor]] by [[Gustave Dore]].]]
Saul planned a military action against the Philistines. Samuel said that he would arrive in seven days to perform the requisite rites. When a week passed with no word of Samuel, and with the Israelites growing restless, Saul prepares for battle by offering sacrifices. Samuel arrives just as Saul is finishing sacrificing and reprimands Saul for not obeying his instructions.

Later Samuel instructs Saul to make war on the [[Amalekite]]s and to "utterly destroy" them,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:3|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fulfilment of a mandate set out {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:19|NRSV}}:
:''When the Lord your God has given you rest from all your enemies on every hand, in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, you shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; do not forget''.
Having forewarned the [[Kenite]]s who were living among the Amalekites to leave, Saul goes to war and defeats the Amalekites. Saul kills all the men, women, children and poor quality livestock, but leaves alive the king and best livestock. When Samuel learns that Saul has not obeyed his instructions in full, he informs Saul that God has rejected him as king due to his disobedience. As Samuel turns to go, Saul seizes hold of his garments and tears off a piece; Samuel prophecies that the kingdom will likewise be torn from Saul. Samuel then kills the Amalekite king himself. Samuel and Saul each return home and never meet again after these events ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:33-35|HE}}).

===Saul and David===
[[File:Ernst Josephson. - David och Saul.JPG|thumbnail|300px|David and Saul, by [[Ernst Josephson]]]]
After Samuel tells Saul that God has rejected him as king, [[David]], a son of [[Jesse]], from the [[tribe of Judah]], enters the story: from this point on Saul's story is largely the account of his increasingly troubled relationship with David.

*Samuel heads to [[Bethlehem]], ostensibly to offer [[korban|sacrifice]] and invited Jesse and his sons. Dining together, Jesse's sons are brought one by one to Samuel, each being rejected; at last, Jesse sends for David, the youngest, who is tending sheep. When brought to Samuel, David is anointed by him in front of his other brothers.
*In {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|16:14–23|HE}}, Saul is troubled by an evil spirit sent by God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/16.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on 1 Samuel 16], accessed 12 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He requests soothing music, and a servant recommends David the son of Jesse, who is renowned for his skills as a [[harp]]ist and other talents:
:''a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and the Lord is with him''
:When word of Saul's needs reaches Jesse, he sends David, who had been looking after Jesse's flock, with gifts as a [[tribute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|16:20|NKJV}}: a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat&lt;/ref&gt; and David is appointed as Saul's armor bearer. With Jesse's permission he remains at court, playing the harp as needed to calm Saul during his troubled spells. ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|17:15|NKJV}} suggests David only attended court periodically).
*({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|17:1–18:5|HE}}) The Philistines return with an army to attack Israel, and the Philistine and Israelite forces gather on opposite sides of a valley. The Philistine's champion [[Goliath]] issues a challenge for single combat, but none of the Israelite accept. David is described as a young shepherd who happens to be delivering food to his three eldest brothers in the army, and he hears Goliath's challenge. David speaks mockingly of the Philistines to some soldiers; his speech is overheard and reported to Saul, who summons David and appoints David as his champion. David easily defeats Goliath with a single shot from a [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]. At the end of the passage, Saul asks his general, Abner, who David is.

Saul offered his elder daughter Merab as a wife to the now popular David, after his victory over Goliath, but David demurred. David distinguishes himself in the Philistine wars. Upon David's return from battle, the women praise him in song:
:''Saul has slain his thousands and David his tens of thousands'' &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|18:7|NKJV}}, recurring in {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|21:11|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|29:5|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
implying that David is the greater warrior. Saul fears David's growing popularity and henceforth views him as a rival to the throne.

Saul's son Jonathan and David become close friends. Jonathan recognizes David as the rightful king, and "made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2018%20;&amp;version=47;|title=1 Samuel 18 ; ESV – David and Jonathan's Friendship |publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan even gives David his military clothes, symbolizing David's position as successor to Saul.

[[File:Jusepe Leonardo 001.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Saul threatening David, by [[José Leonardo]].]]
On two occasions, Saul threw a spear at David as he played the harp for Saul. David becomes increasingly successful and Saul becomes increasingly resentful. Now Saul actively plots against David. Saul offered his other daughter, Michal in marriage to David. David initially rejects this offer also, claiming he is too poor. Saul offers to accept a [[bride price]] of 100 Philistine [[foreskin]]s, intending that David die in the attempt. Instead, David obtains 200 foreskins and is consequently married to Michal. Jonathan arranges a short-lived reconciliation between Saul and David and for a while David served Saul "as in times past" ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|19:1-7|NKJV}}) until "the distressing spirit from the Lord" re-appeared. Saul sends assassins in the night, but Michal helps him escape, tricking them by placing a household idol in his bed. David flees to Jonathan, who arranges a meeting with his father. While dining with Saul, Jonathan explains David's absence, saying he has been called away to his brothers. But Saul sees through the ruse and reprimands Jonathan for protecting David, warning him that his love of David will cost him the kingdom, furiously throwing a spear at him. The next day, Jonathan meets with David and tells him Saul's intent. The two friends say their goodbyes, and David flees into the countryside. Saul later marries Michal to another man.

Saul is later informed by his head shepherd, [[Doeg the Edomite]], that high priest [[Ahimelech]] assisted David, giving him the sword of Goliath, which had been kept at the temple at [[Nob, Israel|Nob]]. Doeg kills Ahimelech and eighty-five other priests and Saul orders the death of the entire population of Nob.

David had left Nob by this point and had amassed some 300 disaffected men including some outlaws. With these men David rescues the town of  [[Keilah]] from a Philistine attack. Saul realises he could trap David and his men by laying the city to siege. David realizes that the citizens of Keilah will betray him to Saul. He flees to [[Ziph (Judean Mountains)|Ziph]] pursued by Saul. Saul hunts David in the vicinity of Ziph on two occasions:

*Some of the inhabitants of Ziph betray David's location to Saul, but David hears about it and flees with his men to Maon. Saul follows David, but is forced to break off pursuit when the Philistines invade. After dealing with that threat Saul tracks [[David]] to the caves at [[Ein Gedi|Engedi]]. As he searches the cave David manages to cut off a piece of Saul's robe without being discovered, yet David restrains his men from harming the king. David then leaves the cave, revealing himself to Saul, and gives a speech that persuades Saul to reconcile.
*On the second occasion, Saul returns to Ziph with his men. When David hears of this, he slips into Saul's camp by night, and again restrains his men from killing the king; instead he steals Saul's spear and water jug, leaving his own spear thrust into the ground by Saul's side. The next day, David reveals himself to Saul, showing the jug and spear as proof that he could have slain him. David then persuades Saul to reconcile with him; the two swear never to harm each other. After this they never see each other again.

===Battle of Gilboa and the death of King Saul===
[[File:Bataille de Gelboé.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The Battle of Gilboa, by [[Jean Fouquet]], the protagonists depicted anachronistically with 15th Century armour]]
The Philistines make war again, assembling at [[Shunem]], and Saul leads his army to face them at [[Mount Gilboa]]. Before the battle he goes to consult a medium or [[Witch of Endor|witch]] at [[Endor (village)|Endor]]. The medium, unaware of his identity, reminds him that the king has made [[witchcraft]] a [[capital punishment|capital offence]], but he assures her that Saul will not harm her. She conjures the spirit of the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], who before his death had prophesied that he would lose the kingdom. Samuel tells him that God has fully rejected him, will no longer hear his prayers, has given the kingdom to David and that the next day he will lose both the battle and his life. Saul collapses in fear, and the medium restores him with food in anticipation of the next day's battle.

1 Samuel and 2 Samuel give conflicting accounts of Saul's death. In 1 Samuel, and in a parallel account in 1 Chronicles 10, as the defeated Israelites flee, Saul asks his armour bearer to kill him, but he refuses, and so Saul falls upon his own sword. In 2 Samuel, an [[Amalekite]] tells David he found Saul leaning on his spear after the battle and delivered the ''[[coup de grâce]]''. David has the Amalekite put to death for accusing himself of killing the anointed king.

The victorious Philistines recover Saul's body as well as those of his three sons who also died in the battle, decapitated them and displayed them on the wall of Beth-shan. They display Saul's armour in the temple of [[Astarte|Ashtaroth]] (an [[Ashkelon|Ascalonian]] temple of the Canaanites). But at night the inhabitants of [[Jabesh-Gilead]] retrieve the bodies for cremation and burial ({{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 31:8–13, 1 Chronicles 10:12}}). Later on, David takes the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan and buries them in Zela, in the tomb of his father ({{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 21:12–14}}).&lt;ref&gt;G. Darshan, [https://www.academia.edu/7021887/The_Reinterment_of_Saul_and_Jonathans_Bones_II_Sam_21_12-14_in_Light_of_Ancient_Greek_Hero-Cult_Stories_ZAW_125_4_2013_640-645  "The Reinterment of Saul and Jonathan's Bones (II Sam 21, 12–14) in Light of Ancient Greek Hero-Cult Stories"], [[Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft|ZAW]], 125,4 (2013), 640–645.&lt;/ref&gt; The account in 1 Chronicles summarises by stating that:
:''Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he had committed against the Lord, because he did not keep the word of the Lord, and also because he consulted a medium for guidance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|10:13-14|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical criticism==
There are several textual or narrative issues in the text, including the aforementioned conflicting accounts of Saul's rise to kingship and his death, as well as plays on words, that biblical scholars have discussed.

The birth-narrative of the prophet [[Samuel]] is found at 1 Samuel 1–28. It describes how Samuel's mother [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] requests a son from [[Yahweh]], and dedicates the child to God at the shrine of Shiloh. The passage makes extensive play with the root-elements of Saul's name, and ends with the phrase ''hu sa'ul le-Yahweh'', "he is dedicated to Yahweh." Hannah names the resulting son Samuel, giving as her explanation, "because from God I requested him." Samuel's name, however, can mean "name of God," (or "Heard of God" or "Told of God") and the etymology and multiple references to the root of the name seems to fit Saul instead. The majority explanation for the discrepancy is that the narrative originally described the birth of Saul, and was given to Samuel in order to enhance the position of [[David]] and [[Samuel]] at the former king's expense.&lt;ref&gt;The idea was originally advanced in the 19th century, and has most recently been elaborated in [[P. Kyle McCarter, Jr.|Kyle McCarter]]'s influential commentary on I Samuel (P. Kyle McCarter, "I Samuel: A New Translation with Introduction, Notes and Commentary", Anchor Bible Series, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible's tone with regard to Saul changes over the course of the narrative, especially around the passage where David appears, midway through 1 Samuel. Before, Saul is presented in positive terms, but afterward his mode of ecstatic prophecy is suddenly described as fits of madness, his errors and disobedience to Samuel's instructions are stressed and he becomes a paranoiac. This may indicate that the David story is inserted from a source loyal to the House of David; David's lament over Saul in 2 Samuel 1 then serves an apologetic purpose, clearing David of the blame for Saul's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible): Lecture 13 – The Deuteronomistic History: Prophets and Kings (1 and 2 Samuel) |website=Yale Open Courses |publisher=Yale University |first=Christine |last=Hayes |url=http://oyc.yale.edu/religious-studies/rlst-145/lecture-13 |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

God's apparent change of mind in rejecting Saul as king has raised questions about God's "repentance", which could be considered as inconsistent with God's [[Immutability (theology)|immutability]]. In the [[King James Version]], God's word to Samuel states "It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king". Samuel's words later clarify that God's repentance is not like human regret or reconsideration:
:''The Strength of Israel will not lie nor relent. For He is not a man, that He should relent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:29|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Methodist biblical commentator [[Joseph Benson]] writes that "Repentance, properly speaking, implies grief of heart, and a change of counsels. Understood in which sense, it can have no place in God. But it is often ascribed to him in the Scriptures when he alters his method of dealing with persons, and treats them as if he did indeed repent of the kindness he had shown them."&lt;ref&gt;Benson, J., [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/15.htm Benson Commentary on 1 Samuel 15], accessed 10 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Books of Samuel]], Saul is not referred to as a king (''melech''), but rather as a "leader" or "commander" (''nagid'') ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|9:16|HE}}; {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|10:1|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;Bright, John, ''A History of Israel'', The Westminster Press, Philadelphia, 1972, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Saul is also said to be made a "king" (''melech'') at [[Gilgal]] ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|11:15|HE}}).

Various authors have attempted to harmonize the two narratives regarding Saul's death. [[Josephus]] writes that Saul's attempted suicide was stalled because he was not able to run the sword through himself, and that he therefore asked the Amalekite to finish it.&lt;ref name="arnold"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Bill T. Arnold|title = The Amalekite report of Saul's death: political intrigue or incompatible sources?|journal = J. Evangelical Theological Society|volume = 32|issue = 3|year = 1989|pages = 289–298|url = http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/32/32-3/32-3-pp289-298_JETS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later biblical criticism has posited that the story of Saul's death was [[Documentary hypothesis|redacted from various sources]], although this view in turn has been criticized because it does not explain why the contradiction was left in by the redactors.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt; But since 2 Samuel records only the Amalekite's report, and not the report of any other eye-witness, some scholars theorize that the Amalekite may have been lying to try to gain favor with David. On this view, 1 Samuel records what actually happened, while 2 Samuel records what the Amalekite ''claims'' happened.&lt;ref&gt;Life Application Study Bible: Note on 2 Samuel 1:13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical rabbinical views==
Two opposing views of Saul are found in classical rabbinical literature. One is based on the [[abductive reasoning|reverse logic]] that punishment is a proof of guilt, and therefore seeks to rob Saul of any halo which might surround him; typically this view is similar to the ''republican source''. The passage referring to Saul as ''a choice young man, and goodly'' (1 Samuel 9:2) is in this view interpreted as meaning that Saul was not good in every respect, but ''goodly'' only with respect to his personal appearance (Num. Rashi 9:28). According to this view, Saul is only a ''weak branch'' (Gen. Rashi 25:3), owing his kingship not to his own merits, but rather to his grandfather, who had been accustomed to light the streets for those who went to the ''bet ha-midrash'', and had received as his reward the promise that one of his grandsons should sit upon the throne (Lev. Rashi 9:2).

The second view of Saul makes him appear in the most favourable light as man, as hero, and as king. This view is similar to that of the ''monarchical source''. In this view it was on account of his modesty that he did not reveal the fact that he had been anointed king (1 Samuel 10:16; Meg. 13b); and he was extraordinarily upright as well as perfectly just. Nor was there any one more pious than he (M. Q. 16b; Ex. Rashi 30:12); for when he ascended the throne he was as pure as a child, and had never committed sin (Yoma 22b). He was marvelously handsome; and the maidens who told him concerning Samuel (cf 1 Samuel 9:11–13) talked so long with him that they might observe his beauty the more (Ber. 48b). In war he was able to march 120 miles without rest. When he received the command to smite [[Amalek]] (1 Samuel 15:3), Saul said: ''For one found slain the [[Torah]] requires a [[sin offering]] [Deuteronomy 21:1–9]; and here so many shall be slain. If the old have sinned, why should the young suffer; and if men have been guilty, why should the cattle be destroyed?'' It was this mildness that cost him his crown. And while Saul was merciful to his enemies, he was strict with his own people; when he found out that [[Ahimelech]], a kohen, had assisted David with finding food, Saul, in retaliation, killed the rest of the 85 kohanim of the family of Ahimelech and the rest of his hometown, Nov. ([http://dafyomi.shemayisrael.co.il/yoma/insites/yo-dt-022.htm Yoma 22b]; Num. Rashi 1:10) The fact that he was merciful even to his enemies, being indulgent to rebels themselves, and frequently waiving the homage due to him, was incredible as well as deceiving. But if his mercy toward a foe was a sin, it was his only one; and it was his misfortune that it was reckoned against him, while David, although he had committed much iniquity, was so favored that it was not remembered to his injury (Yoma 22b; M. Q. 16b, and Rashi ad loc.). In some respects Saul was superior to David, e.g., in having only one concubine {[[Rizpah]]}, while David had many. Saul expended his own substance for the war, and although he knew that he and his sons would fall in battle, he nevertheless went forward, while David heeded the wish of his soldiers not to go to war in person (2 Samuel 21:17; Lev. Rashi 26:7; Yalq., Sam. 138).

According to the Rabbis, Saul ate his food with due regard for the rules of [[ritual impurity|ceremonial purity]] prescribed for the sacrifice (Yalq., l.c.), and taught the people how they should slay cattle (cf 1 Samuel 14:34). As a reward for this, God himself gave Saul a sword on the day of battle, since no other sword suitable for him was found (ibid 13:22). Saul's attitude toward David finds its excuse in the fact that his courtiers were all tale-bearers, and slandered David to him (Deut. Rashi 5:10); and in like manner he was incited by [[Doeg the Edomite|Doeg]] against the priests of Nob (1 Samuel 22:16–19; Yalq., Sam. 131)—this act was forgiven him, however, and a heavenly voice (''bat qol'') was heard, proclaiming: ''Saul is the chosen one of God'' (Ber. 12b). His anger at the Gibeonites (2 Samuel 21:2) was not personal hatred, but was induced by zeal for the welfare of Israel (Num. Rashi 8:4). The fact that he made his daughter remarry (1 Samuel 25:44), finds its explanation in his (Saul's) view that her betrothal to David had been gained by false pretenses, and was therefore invalid (Sanhedrin 19b). During the lifetime of Saul there was no idolatry in Israel. The famine in the reign of David (cf 2 Samuel 21:1) was to punish the people, because they had not accorded Saul the proper honours at his burial (Num. Rashi 8:4). In [[Sheol]], Samuel reveals to Saul that in the next world, Saul would dwell with Samuel, which is a proof that all has been forgiven him by God ('Er. 53ba).

==In Islam==
Some Muslims refer to Saul as [[Talut|Tālūt]] ({{lang-ar|طالوت}}), and believe that (as in the Bible) he was the commander of Israel. Other scholars, however, have identified Talut as Gideon&lt;ref name=al-islam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=315&amp;region=E1&amp;CR=EN,E2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the reasoning that the Qur'an references the same incident of the drinking from the river as that found in Judges 7:5–7 and other factors associated with Gideon. According to the [[Qur'an]], Talut was chosen by the Prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] (not mentioned by name explicitly, but rather as "a Prophet" of the Israelites) after being asked by the people of Israel for a [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|King]]) to lead them into war. The Israelites criticized Samuel for appointing Talut, lacking respect for Talut because he was not wealthy. Samuel rebuked the people for this and told them that Talut was more favored than they were. Talut led the Israelites to victory over the army of [[Goliath]], who was killed by [[David in Islam|Dawud]] (David). Talut is not considered a ''[[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Nabi]]'' ({{lang-ar|نَـبِي}}, [[Prophet]]), but a Divinely appointed King.&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|246|e=251|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran |2 |246 |e=252 |s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
The name 'Tālūt' has uncertain [[etymology]]. Unlike some other Qur'anic figures, the Arabic name is not similar to the Hebrew name (''Sha'ul''). According to [[Tafsir|Muslim exegetes]], the name 'Tālūt' means 'Tall' (from the Arabic "tūl") and refers to the extraordinary stature of Saul, which would be consistent with the Biblical account.&lt;ref name=Oliver2006&gt;Leaman, Oliver, ''The Quran, An Encyclopedia'', 2006, p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt; In explanation of the name, exegetes such as [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tha'labi|Tha'labi]] hold that at this time, the future King of Israel was to be recognised by his height; Samuel set up a measure, but no one in Israel reached its height except Tālūt (Saul).

===Saul as the King of Israel===
In the Qur'an, Israelites demanded a King after the time of [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] ([[Moses]]). God appointed Talut as their King. Saul was distinguished by the greatness of his knowledge and of his physique; it was a sign of his role as King that [[God]] brought back the [[Ark of the Covenant]] for [[Israel]]. Talut tested his people at a river; whoever drank from it would not follow him in battle excepting one who takes [from it] in the hollow of his hand. Many drank but only the faithful ventured on. In the battle, however, [[David]] slew Goliath and was made the subsequent King of Israel.&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|246|e=251|s=ns"/&gt;

The Qur'anic account&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|246|e=251|s=ns"/&gt; differs from the Biblical account (if Saul is assumed to be Talut) in that in the Bible the sacred Ark was returned to Israel before Saul's accession, and the test by drinking water is made in the [[Hebrew Bible]] not by Saul but by [[Gideon#Biblical narrative|Gideon]].&lt;ref name=Judges&gt;Judges vii. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the story of Saul in 1 Samuel 14 has parallels to Qur'an 2:246-251, faithfully accounting for the sacred Ark and the fasting test ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|14:18|HE}}; {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|14:24-48|HE}}; {{Cite Quran|2|246|end=251|style=ns|t=y}}).

==Historicity==
The [[The Bible and history|historicity]] of Saul's kingdom is not universally accepted&lt;ref name="finkelstein"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Finkelstein |first=Israel |author-link=Israel Finkelstein |editor1-last=Amit |editor1-first=Yairah |editor2-first=Ehud |editor2-last=Ben Zvi |editor3-last=Finkelstein |editor3-first=Israel |editor4-first=Oded |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Lipschits |encyclopedia=Essays on Ancient Israel in Its Near Eastern Context: A Tribute to Nadav Naʼaman |title=The Last Labayu: King Saul and the Expansion of the First North Israelite Territorial Entity |url=https://www.academia.edu/1070440/The_Last_Labayu_King_Saul_and_the_Expansion_of_the_First_North_Israelite_Territorial_Entity |year=2006 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |isbn=9781575061283 |pages=171 ff. |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=David's Secret Demons: Messiah, Murderer, Traitor, King |author=Baruch Halpern |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans |year=2003 |pages=208–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is insufficient extrabiblical evidence to verify if the biblical account reflects historical reality.&lt;ref name=Nelson2014&gt;[[Richard D. Nelson|Nelson, Richard D.]] Historical Roots of the Old Testament (1200–63 BCE). Volume 13 of Biblical Encyclopedia.  Society of Biblical Lit, 2014 {{ISBN|9781628370065}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50ff}} The notion of a United Monarchy of Israel and Judah is believed by some scholars to be a later [[ideology|ideological]] construct; statehood in Judah is thought, on the basis of [[Biblical archaeology|archaeological]] evidence, to have emerged no earlier than the 8th century BCE.{{r|finkelstein}}

Saul’s kingdom was not very large. It probably included Mt. Ephraim, Benjamin and Gilead. He also exerted some influence in the northern mountains in Judah and beyond the Jezreel Valley. His capital appears to have been basically a military camp near Gibeah. Archeology seems to confirm that until about 1000 BCE, the end of Iron Age I, Israelite society was essentially a society of farmers and stockbreeders without any truly centralized organization and administration.&lt;ref name=Lemaire/&gt;

==Psychological analyses==
Accounts of Saul's behavior have made him a popular subject for speculation among modern psychiatrists. George Stein views the passages depicting Saul's ecstatic episodes as suggesting that he may have suffered from mania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/198/3/212|title=Stein, George. "The case of King Saul: did he have recurrent unipolar depression or bipolar affective disorder? – psychiatry in the Old Testament", ''The British Journal of Psychiatry'' (2011), 198: p.212|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Huisman sees the story of Saul as illustrative of the role of stress as a factor in depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= King Saul, work-related stress and depression|publisher=|pmc=2652967 | pmid=17873225|doi=10.1136/jech.2007.066522|volume=61|issue=10|year=2007|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|pages=890 | last1 = Huisman | first1 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liubov Ben-Noun of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, believes that passages referring to King Saul's disturbed behavior indicate he was afflicted by a mental disorder, and lists a number of possible conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccs.sagepub.com/content/2/4/270.abstract|title=Ben-Noun, Liubov. "What was the Mental Disease that Afflicted King Saul?", ''Clinical Case Studies'', October 2003 vol. 2 no. 4 pp. 270–282|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Christopher C. H. Cook of the Department of Theology and Religion, Durham University, UK recommends caution in offering any diagnoses in relation to people who lived millennia ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/36/6/225.full|title=Cook, Christopher C.H., "Psychiatry in scripture: sacred texts and psychopathology", ''The Psychiatrist'' (2012) 36: pp. 225–229|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shmuel Schneersohn''' (or '''Rabbi Shmuel of Lubavitch''' or '''The Rebbe Maharash''') (17 March 1834 – 14 September 1882 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|OS]]) was an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]] and the fourth [[Rebbe]] (spiritual leader) of the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|chasidic]] movement.

==Biography==
Rabbi Schneersohn was born in [[Lyubavichi, Rudnyansky District, Smolensk Oblast|Lyubavichi]], on 2 Iyar 1834, the seventh son of the [[Menachem Mendel Schneersohn|Tzemach Tzedek]]. He faced competition from three of his brothers, primarily from Rabbi [[Yehuda Leib Schneersohn]] who established a dynasty in Kapust upon their father's death. Other brothers also established dynasties in [[Lyady, Vitebsk Region|Lyady]], [[Nizhyn]], and [[Ovruch]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer HaToldot Rav Shmuel, Admor Maharash'', Glitzenstein, A. H.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848 Rabbi Schneersohn was married to the daughter of his brother, Rabbi Chaim Shneur Zalman Schneersohn. After several months, she died, and he then married the [[Rebbetzin]] Rivkah, a granddaughter of Rabbi [[Dovber Schneuri]], the Mitteler Rebbe. He had three sons, Rabbi Zalman Aharon, Rabbi [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn|Shalom Dovber]] and Rabbi Menachem Mendel as well as one daughter, Rebbetzin Devorah Leah.

Rabbi Schneersohn was said to have had chariots on call for the evacuation of books in time of fire.&lt;ref&gt;''The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present'', M. Avrum Ehrlich, ch.16 note.12, KTAV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-88125-836-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his communal activism, he had wide intellectual interests. He spoke several languages, including [[Latin]].&lt;ref name="ilo"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Hasidism, entry: Schneersohn, Shmuel''. Naftali Lowenthal. Aronson, London 1996. {{ISBN|1-56821-123-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote widely on a range of religious and secular topics, and much of his writing has never been published and remains in manuscript form alone.&lt;ref name="ilo"/&gt; His discourses began to be published for the first time under the title ''Likkutei Torat Shmuel'' in 1945 by [[Kehot]], and 12 volumes have so far been printed.&lt;ref name="ilo"/&gt;

He died in Lyubavichi, on 13 Tishrei 1882, leaving three sons and two daughters, and was succeeded by his son [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn|Sholom Dovber]].&lt;ref name="ilo"/&gt;

Rabbi Schneersohn urged the study of [[Kabbalah]] as a prerequisite for one's humanity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A person who is capable of comprehending the ''[[seder hishtalshelus]]'' (kabbalistic secrets concerning the coming-into-being of all existence every moment) - and fails to do so - cannot be considered a human being. At every moment and time one must know where his soul stands. It is a [[mitzvah]] (commandment) and an obligation to know the ''seder hishtalshelus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/sefer-hatoldos-admur-maharash/09.htm ''Sefer HaToldos Admur Maharash''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514105202/http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/sefer-hatoldos-admur-maharash/09.htm |date=2007-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Sophia of Bavaria''' ({{Lang-cs|Žofie Bavorská}}; {{Lang-de|Sophie von Bayern}}; 1376 – 4 November 1428&lt;ref&gt;In a Munich archive, letters of Sophia from the years 1422-1427 have been found. B. Kopičková, Mnichovský fascikl č. 543. Korespondence královny Žofie z období březen 1422 – prosinec 1427. In: ''Mediaevalia Historica Bohemica'' 8, 2001, s. 121–138.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Queen consort|Queen]] of [[Bohemia]] and the spouse of [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]], King of Bohemia and [[King of the Romans]]. She was briefly interim regent of Bohemia after the death of Wenceslaus in 1419.

== Family and early life==
Sophia was a member of the [[House of Wittelsbach]] and was the youngest child and only daughter of [[John II, Duke of Bavaria]], and his spouse [[Catherine of Gorizia]]. Sophia's two brothers were [[Ernest, Duke of Bavaria]], and [[William III, Duke of Bavaria]].

Her paternal grandparents were [[Stephen II, Duke of Bavaria]] and his first wife [[Elisabeth of Sicily (1310–1349)|Elisabetta of Sicily]], daughter of [[Frederick III of Sicily]] and [[Eleanor of Anjou]].  Sophia was a cousin of [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], Queen of France. Sophia's maternal grandparents were Count Meinhard VI of Gorizia and Catharina of Pfannberg.

Sophia grew up in the care of her uncle, [[Frederick, Duke of Bavaria]], in [[Landshut]]. Sophia liked hunting, which was one thing she had in common with her future husband. In 1388 uncle took her to [[Prague]], where he worked through political negotiations to have his niece married off. He said that the twelve-year-old princess was impressed with Wenceslaus, moreover, the marriage was for political reasons. Sophia's father was represented in the negotiation of the marriage by her uncle Duke Frederick.

== Queen ==

On 2 May 1389 in Prague, Sophia married [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans]]. Wenceslas and Sophie were probably married by the king's chancellor, Bishop Jan. Wenceslaus was in a dispute with the Archbishop of Prague, which threatened Sophia's coronation. She could have only been crowned queen by an archbishop.

Wenceslaus celebrated the marriage by making a number of excellent manuscripts such as the [[Wenceslas Bible]]. There was also a manuscript on marital fidelity. The relationship was described as happy. Sophia had no children.

Sophia's husband was certainly not an incompetent ruler, in chronicles he was described in a biased manner. Sophia is described as economically talented. In March 1393, her confessor [[John of Nepomuk]] died under [[torture]]. It was said that he died refusing to reveal her [[Confession (religion)|confession]], but he was also at that time involved in a conflict with [[Jan of Jenštejn]]. During the rebellion and the imprisonment of her spouse in 1402–1403, she lived in [[Hradec Králové]]. Queen Sophia was initially a follower of [[Jan Hus]] and listened to his sermons, and like Wenceslas, she gave him her protection. After Hus was banned by the Pope in 1410, however, she withdraw her support. She was convinced that the death of Hus, in 1415, would lead to a riot.

== Queen dowager and regent ==

Wenceslaus died in 1419. As a queen dowager, Sophia sought refuge with her brother-in-law, [[Sigismund of Hungary]], whose claims on the throne of Bohemia she supported. For a period of time, Sophia was the official regent of Bohemia. In October 1419, the leading Bohemians signed a treaty with queen dowager Sophia with a promise to protect law and order. She soon lost authority, however. Sophia and Sigismund were involved in managing a property in [[Prešpurk]] together. There were rumours that Sophia and Sigismund had an affair. Sigismund remarked that the Queen dowager of Bohemia would surely marry again – possibly to [[Jogaila|Wladyslaw II of Poland]].

Sophia died on 4 November 1428.

He is a founding partner at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research (GQR), a Washington D.C. headquartered political research and campaign company, that is closely affiliated with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

==Life and career==
A [[political science|political scientist]] who received his bachelor's degree from [[Miami University]] and his Ph.D. from [[Harvard]], Greenberg spent a decade teaching at [[Yale University]] before becoming a [[political consultant]].&lt;ref name="miller2005" /&gt; His 1985 study of [[Reagan Democrat]]s in [[Macomb County, Michigan]] became a classic of progressive political strategy, and the basis for his continuing argument that Democrats must actively work to present themselves as [[populism|populists]] advocating the expansion of opportunity for the [[middle class]].&lt;ref name="miller2005" /&gt; As the pollster for Clinton in 1992, Greenberg was a major figure in the famed campaign "war room" (and hence the [[The War Room|documentary film of the same name]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The War Room Drill |url=https://www.newsweek.com/war-room-drill-196678 |work=Newsweek |date=October 31, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the CEO of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a polling and consulting firm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stanley B. Greenberg, Ph.D. |url=https://www.gqrr.com/stanley-b-greenberg |website=Greenberg Quinlan Rosner |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder (with [[James Carville]] and [[Bob Shrum]]) of Democracy Corps, a non-profit organization which produces left-leaning political strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Founders |url=http://www.democracycorps.com/the-founders/ |website=Democracy Corps |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenberg's current and former corporate clients include [[British Petroleum]], [[British Airways]], [[Monsanto Company]]  and [[General Motors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbergresearch.com/index.php?ID=109 Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research client list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824154628/http://www.greenbergresearch.com/index.php?ID=109 |date=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
During his work for the Austrian [[SPÖ]] in 2001, Greenberg was heavily criticized and derided by [[FPÖ]] leader [[Jörg Haider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cohen |first1=Roger |title=Haider the Rightist Is Firing Up Vienna's Election With Slurs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/12/world/haider-the-rightist-is-firing-up-vienna-s-election-with-slurs.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 12, 2001 |page=A8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010 Greenberg was linked to a controversy involving [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Rahm Emanuel]]. As a House member, Emanuel had lived for five years in a rent-free D.C. apartment jointly owned by Greenberg's wife, Democratic House member [[Rosa DeLauro]] of Connecticut, and Greenberg. During this time, Emanuel was chairman of a committee that awarded large polling contracts to Greenberg's firm.&lt;ref name="Malcolm"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malcolm|first1=Andrew |title=The ties that bind. Remember Rahm Emanuel's rent-free D.C. apartment? The owner: A BP adviser |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/06/rahm-emanuel-bp-gul-oil-spill.html |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 7, 2010|accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2010 [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], Greenberg's work for BP became controversial. Greenberg's firm has been called a "prime architect" of BP's effort to rebrand itself as a green petroleum company.&lt;ref name="Malcolm" /&gt; As early as 2002, critics had deemed that effort "[[greenwashing]]".&lt;ref name="Stauber"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stauber|first1=John |title=BP Oil's $200 Million Greenwashing Campaign |url=http://www.prwatch.org/node/1608 |publisher=[[Center for Media and Democracy]]|accessdate=2014-06-07|date=December 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Greenberg is married to Congresswoman [[Rosa DeLauro]], who currently represents [[Connecticut's 3rd congressional district]]. Financial disclosures filed in Congress indicate that DeLauro is a multimillionaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beaulieu |first=Scott |url=http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Sen-Blumenthal-is-One-of-the-Ten-Richest-in-Congress-128244983.html |title=Sen.

'''Stuart Pigott''' (born 26 May 1960 in [[Orpington]], [[Kent]])&lt;!-- Orpington was in Kent until 1963 --&gt; is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[wine]] [[critic]] and [[author]] who has lived in [[Berlin]] since 1993.&lt;ref name=""&gt;[http://www.stuartpigott.de/stuartpigott/uebermich Stuart Pigott.de: ''Über mich''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317043658/http://www.stuartpigott.de/stuartpigott/uebermich |date=17 March 2008 }}, accessed on 16 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Pigott mostly writes in [[German language|German]], and focuses on [[German wine]]. He writes for the specialist magazines ''Feinschmecker'' and ''Weingourmet'' as well as the Sunday edition of the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.

==Biography==
Between 1979 and 1986, Pigott studied various art-related subjects off and on at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College of Art]], [[St. Martins School of Art]] and the [[Royal College of Art]]. He ended up with a master's degree in the History of Culture. During his studies he started as a wine writer, and published his first piece in ''[[Decanter (magazine)|Decanter]]'' magazine in 1984.

Pigott moved to Berlin with his wife, [[sommelier]] and later food writer [[Ursula Heinzelmann]], in late 1993 and published his first German-language book in 1994. From early on, he joined fellow British wine writer [[Hugh Johnson (wine)|Hugh Johnson]] in taking a critical view towards the mass production mentality that prevailed in parts of the German wine industry, and thus became popular with more quality-oriented producers.&lt;ref&gt;Karacs, Imre, ''The Independent'' (25 August 1996). [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960825/ai_n14069634 "German wine-makers given a taste of vintage British scorn"], accessed on 16 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking his inspiration from [[Hunter S. Thompson]] and [[Tom Wolfe]], Pigott has in recent years tried to emulate the style of [[Gonzo journalism]] in the wine area. He has published a number of free educational wine videos in the "Gonzo" style on the Internet. In the semester 2008/2009 he took lessons at the University of Applied Sciences in Geisenheim comprising the [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campus-geisenheim.de/1-2009-Campus-Geisenheim-Newsletter.2919.0.html Campus-Geisenheim-Newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stuart Pigott's five commandments==
As part of his educational material, Pigott uses the following five commandments on wine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuartpigott.de/sixcms/media.php/664/Meine%20Weinschule-Gesetze.pdf |title= Stuart Pigott.de: ''Stuart Pigotts fünf Gesetze des Weins'' |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080920200541/http://www.stuartpigott.de/sixcms/media.php/664/Meine%20Weinschule-Gesetze.pdf |archivedate= 20 September 2008 |df= dmy-all }}, accessed on 16 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

# A wine is as good or bad as it tastes and smells to you.
# For wine, there is no connection between price and quality.
# Wine is not nearly so complicated or delicate as generally assumed.
# There are no wrong words to describe wine.
# There is only one error that is possible to make in connection with wine: to ruin other people's pleasure.

'''Syndic''' ([[Latin|Late Latin]]: ''{{lang|la|syndicus}}''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''{{lang|el|σύνδικος, sýndikos}}'' – one who helps in a court of justice, an advocate, representative) is a term applied in certain countries to an officer of government with varying powers, and secondly to a representative or delegate of a university, institution or other corporation, entrusted with special functions or powers.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Syndic |volume=26 |page=293 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning which underlies both applications is that of representative or delegate. [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]] (''Gloss, s.v. Syndicus''), after defining the word as defensor, patronus, advocatus, proceeds "Syndici maxime appellantur Actores universitatum, collegiorum, societatum et aliorum corporum, per quos, tanquam in republica quod communiter agi fierive oportet, agitur et fit," and gives several examples from the 13th century of the use of the term. The most familiar use of ''syndic'' in the first sense is that of the Italian ''sindaco'' (or , who is the head of the administration of a ''[[comune]]'', comparable to a [[mayor]], and a government official, elected by the residents of commune.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Use in Public Administration and Ombudsman bodies ==
=== Use in Italian linguistic areas ===
As indicated above, in [[Italy]] and parts of [[Switzerland]], the term ''sindaco'' or ''sindaca'' is equivalent to the English term mayor, in this case, the head of the administration of a ''[[comune]]''.

=== Use in Catalan or Occitan linguistic areas ===
In areas where [[Catalan language|Catalan]] or [[Occitan]] are spoken, the term has been used since Medieval times. At present it is used in a variety of cases. The president of [[General Council of the Valleys|Andorra's parliament]] is known as the ''[[General Council of Andorra|''Síndic General'']]'' or General Councillor. Until the [[Constitution of Andorra|1993 Constitution]], the Síndic was the effective [[head of government of Andorra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consellgeneral.ad/ca/el-consell-dandorra El Consell General del Principat d'Andorra (The General Council of the Principality of Andorra)], official website of the [[Parliament of Andorra|Andorran Parliament]].

(Catalan). Consulted 15 April.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Sindic d'Aran / Síndic d'Aran (in [[Occitan]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]], respectively) is the head of the administration of this small region ([[Vall d'Aran]]) in [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conselharan.org/eth-conselh/ Eth Conselh Generau d'Aran / The General Council of Aran], official website. ([[Aranese]]) / (Occitan), (Catalan), (Spanish). Consulted 15 April.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and the [[Valencian Community]], the ''Síndic de Greuges'' or ''Síndica de Greuges'' ("advocate of grievances") is the [[ombudsman]] or [[ombudswoman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsindic.com/en/index.html "Síndic de Greuges de la Comunitat Valenciana / Ombudsman of the Valencian Region"], official website.

(Catalan), (Spanish), (English). Consulted 15 April.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the Horta de València region (the area around the city of [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]]), a ''síndic'' is also a member of the Water Tribunal (''Tribunal de les Aigües''), the body in charge of regulating irrigation matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.gva.es/ca/web/estatuto/el-tribunal-de-las-aguas-de-la-vega-de-valencia "El Tribunal de les Aigües de l'Horta de València"], on the Valencian Government website. (Catalan), (Spanish).

(Catalan). Consulted 15 April.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Alguer]], [[Sardinia]], the ''síndic'' is the equivalent of mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciutatdelalguer.it/sindaco.htm Lo Govern de la Ciutat: Lo Síndic], website of the city of Alguer. (Catalan), (Italian). Consulted 15 April.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in labour organisations, associations, guilds and universities ==
In Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, nearly all companies, guilds, and the [[University of Paris]] had representative bodies the members of which were termed ''syndici''. Similarly in [[England]], the Regent House of the [[University of Cambridge]], which is the legislative body, delegates certain functions to special committees of its members, appointed from time to time by Grace (a proposal offered to the Regent House and confirmed by it); these committees are termed "syndicates" and are permanent or occasional, and the members are styled "the syndics" of the particular committee or of the institution which they administer; thus there are the syndics of the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], of the [[Cambridge University Press]], of local examinations, etc.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The term ''sindicat'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is used in a broad sense to mean an association for the defence of the economic or social interests of its members, and therefore is often used generically to refer to [[labour organization]]s, as well as in the titles of certain [[labour organization]]s or federations (for instance, the Confederació Sindical de Treballadors de Catalunya, the Unió Sindical Obrera de Catalunya, the Coordinadora Obrera Sindical, etc.), student organizations (Sindicat d'Estudiants dels Països Catalans, Sindicat d'Estudiants del País Valencià, Sindicat Democràtic d'Estudiants de la Universitat de Barcelona, etc.) and journalist organizations (Sindicat de Periodistes de Catalunya / Sindicat de Professionals de la Comunicació, etc.), among others. The members or leaders of these organisations, however, are not called ''síndics''.

== Use in France in property management ==
In France, a ''syndic de copropriété'' is an important figure in millions of lives, elected by owners of condominiums to represent property owners in the management of the co-owned building or property.  While the profession is regulated, fees are not, and complaints of overcharging are frequent.  The ''Association des responsables de copropriété'' (ARC) reported that fees rose by 4% in 2016, though the rate of inflation was only 0.2%, and since 2014 three of the largest ''syndics'' in Paris have raised their fees by amounts ranging from 26% to 37%.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Canard enchaîné'' (Paris), June 28, 2017, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in religious bodies ==
One special use of the term applies to the Franciscan order of priests and brothers. The [[Order of Friars Minor]] (OFM), as opposed to the Order of Friars Minor Conventual (OFM Conv.) is forbidden by its constitutions from owning property, as part of its commitment to communal poverty. Various arrangements therefore exist whereby churches and houses of the order are owned by the Holy See itself, or the local diocese or, sometimes, by a "syndic," an independent layman who is the actual owner of the land but who loans it to the friars.

== Use in anarchist politics ==
Within [[Syndicalist]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalist]] organizations, a syndic is a member of an autonomous union, also called a Syndicate, which make up the basic organizational unit of society.  As these models are organized along principles of non-hierarchy and direct democracy, the title syndic is applied to all in the syndicate and does not imply a position of power over any other member, unlike older usages of the title.

'''''The 500 Most Influential Muslims''''' (also known as '''''The Muslim 500''''') is an annual publication first published in 2009, which ranks the most influential Muslims in the world.

The publication is compiled by the [[Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre]] in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]].&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onislam1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prnewswire1"/&gt; The report is issued annually in cooperation with [[Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding|Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding]] at [[Georgetown University]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="onislam1"/&gt;

==Overview==
The publication highlights people who are influential as Muslims. That is people whose influence is derived from their practice of Islam or from the fact that they are Muslim.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |last=Butt|first=Riazat|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/19/500-influential-muslims-list|title=The world's most influential Muslims?|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=November 19, 2009|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominations are evaluated on the basis of the influence that particular Muslims have had within the Muslim community and the manner in which their influence has benefited the Muslim community, both within the Islamic world and in terms of representing Islam to non-Muslims.&lt;ref name="thenewstribe"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hasni|first=Areeb|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/05/09/the-top-500-most-influential-muslim-nominations-open-for-2012/|title=The Top 500 Most Influential Muslims: Nominations open for 2012!|work= |location= |publisher=''The News Tribe''|date=May 9, 2012|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Influential" for the purposes of the book is defined as "any person who has the power (be it cultural, ideological, financial, political or otherwise) to make a change that will have a significant impact on the Muslim World".&lt;ref name="aquila-style"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fitriat|first=Afia R|url=http://www.aquila-style.com/focus-points/500-most-influential-muslims-2012/|title=Accomplished Women in 500 Most Influential Muslims 2012|work= |location= |publisher=''Aquila Style''|date=December 5, 2012|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watchdogwire"&gt;{{cite news |last=Swier|first=Dr. Richard|url=http://watchdogwire.com/florida/2013/01/24/who-are-the-top-10-most-influential-muslims-in-the-world/|title=Who are the 10 Most Influential Muslims in the World?|work= |location= |publisher=''WatchdogWire''|date=January 24, 2013|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication defines eligible entries with the following: "Traditional Islam (96% of the world's Muslims): Also known as Orthodox Islam, this ideology is not politicized and largely based on consensus of correct opinion—thus including the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]], and [[Ibadi]] branches of practice (and their subgroups) within the fold of Islam, and not groups such as the [[Druze]] or the [[Ahmadiyya]], among others."&lt;ref name="themuslimtimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Alim|first=Abdul|url=http://www.themuslimtimes.org/2012/11/islam-2/worlds-500-most-influential-muslims-2012-dominated-by-u-s|title=World’s ‘500 Most Influential Muslims’ 2012 Dominated By U.S.|work= |location= |publisher=''The Muslim Times''|date=November 29, 2012|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 edition===
In 2009, the book was edited by Professors [[John Esposito|John L. Esposito]] and Ibrahim Kalin at Georgetown University in Washington.&lt;ref name="islamicvoice"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://islamicvoice.com/December2009/THEMUSLIMWORLD/|title=Book lists '500 Most Influential Muslims': Top 20 inclusions seem to be less convincing and dictated|work= |location= |publisher=''Islamic Voice''|date=December 2009|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 500 most influential Muslims were chosen largely in terms of their overt influence.&lt;ref name="muslimmedianetwork"/&gt; The top 50 is dominated by religious scholars&lt;ref name="ciibroadcasting1"/&gt; and either heads of state, which automatically gives them an advantage when it comes to influence, or they have inherited their position. Lineage is a significant factor – it has its own category – and the predisposition to include children of important people reveals a mindset that indicates achievement is an optional extra.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The top 50 fits into six broad categories as follows: 12 are political leaders (kings, generals, presidents), four are spiritual leaders (Sufi shaykhs), 14 are national or international religious authorities, three are "preachers", six are high-level scholars, 11 are leaders of movements or organizations.&lt;ref name="muslimmedianetwork"/&gt;

The book has given the first place to King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah bin Abdulaziz]] of Saudi Arabia. Second place went to Ayatollah Syed [[Ali Khamenei]], the spiritual leader of Iran. King [[Mohammed VI of Morocco]] found third place and King [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah II Al-Hussain]] of Jordan occupied fourth place. Fifth place went to Turkey's Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref name="islamicvoice"/&gt;

The first solely religious leader is Iraq's Ayatollah [[Ali al-Sistani]] in seventh place. [[Fethullah Gülen]] came 13th. The heads of [[Hezbollah]]; Seyyed [[Hassan Nasrallah]] listed 17th and [[Hamas]] [[Khaled Mashaal]] listed 34th.

The highest-ranking American (and highest-ranking convert) at 38th place was Sheikh [[Hamza Yusuf]] Hanson, founder of the Zaytuna Institute in Berkeley, California. Right after him comes the highest-ranking European, Sheikh [[Mustafa Cerić]], grand mufti of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name="blogs.reuters1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Heneghan|first=Tom|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2009/11/17/poll-the-worlds-top-500-muslims-read-and-vote/|title=POLL: The world’s top 500 Muslims?

In total 72 Americans are among the 500, a disproportionately strong showing.&lt;ref name="muslimmedianetwork"/&gt; [[Timothy Winter]] (Abdal Hakim Murad) was the highest ranked British Muslim, in an unspecified position between 51st and 60th, considerably higher than the three other British people who made the list – the Conservative Party chairman [[Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi|Baroness Sayeeda Warsi]]; the UK's first Muslim life peer, [[Nazir Ahmed, Baron Ahmed|Lord Nazir Ahmed]]; and Dr Anas Al Shaikh Ali, director of the International Institute of Islamic Thought.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/timothy-winter-britains-most-influential-muslim--and-it-was-all-down-to-a-peach-2057400.html|title=Timothy Winter: Britain's most influential Muslim - and it was all down to a peach|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=August 20, 2010|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women featured had a separate section from the men.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; There were only three women listed in the top 50. Sheikha [[Munira al-Qubaysi]] (number 21), an educator of girls and women; [[Queen Rania of Jordan]] (number 37), who promotes global education; and Sheikha [[Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned]] of Qatar (number 38), who is chairwoman of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development.&lt;ref name="timesunion"&gt;{{cite news |last=Haqqie|first=Azra|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/muslimwomen/making-the-500-most-influential-muslims-this-year/4368/|title=Making the ’500 Most Influential Muslims’ this year|work= |location= |publisher=''timesunion.com''|date=November 26, 2012|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The listing also includes an extensive Arts and Culture Section. The general Arts and Culture Section included the names of singers [[Salif Keita]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Raihan]], [[Yusuf Islam]] and [[Sami Yusuf]], [[Dawud Wharnsby]]; musician [[A. R. Rahman]] (India); film stars [[Aamir Khan]] and [[Shahrukh Khan]]; comedian [[Azhar Usman]] and martial artist [[Ma Yue]]. All the [[Qāriʾ]]s (Quran reciters) listed in the book are from Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="islamicvoice"/&gt;

''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine's [[Marc Lynch]] stated, "Esposito and Kalin's methodology seems strange. Any list in which the Sultan of Oman ([[Qaboos bin Said al Said]], who was sixth) outranks, say, Turkish preacher Fethullah Gülen (placed 13th) or the [[Aga Khan]] ([[Aga Khan IV]], who was placed 20th) seems odd to this observer..."&lt;ref name="trueslant"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ungerleider|first=Neal|url=http://trueslant.com/nealungerleider/2009/11/19/the-worlds-500-most-influential-muslims/|title=The world’s 500 most influential Muslims|work= |location= |publisher=''[[True/Slant]]''|date=November 19, 2009|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 edition===
In 2010, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list as the most influential Muslim in the world for the second consecutive year. Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei maintained second place. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan moved into third place. Jordanian King Abdullah II was placed fourth above Moroccan King Mohammed VI who moved down to fifth place.

===2011 edition===
In 2011, achievements of a lifetime were given more weight than achievements within the current year. which meant that the lists of names were going to change gradually, rather than dramatically, year-on-year. The [[Arab Spring]] had no impact on Saudi King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia's influence, it had boosted King Mohammed VI of Morocco's influence, who moved up to second place, and it had no effect on Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who came in third place.&lt;ref name="onislam1"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.onislam.net/english/news/global/454883-worlds-500-most-influential-muslims.html|title=World’s 500 Most Influential Muslims|work= |location= |publisher=''OnIslam''|date=December 3, 2011|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan was expected by many to receive the top spot in light of the Arab Spring. Erdoğan was credited with Turkey's "Muslim democracy", and was seen as the leader of a country that, as the [[Brookings Institution]] said, "played the 'most constructive' role in the Arab events."&lt;ref name="muslimvoices"&gt;{{cite news |last=Leslie|first=Liz|url=http://muslimvoices.org/muslim-500-list-names-influential-muslims/|title=World’s 500 Most Influential Muslims|work= |location= |publisher=''Muslim Voices''|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emir of Qatar Sheikh [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]] influence rose during the Arab Spring, moving him to sixth place. He had driven much of the Arab Spring through the coverage given by ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', given financial support to protesters and political support to Libya, making him arguably the biggest enabler of the Arab Spring.&lt;ref name="blogs.reuters2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Heneghan|first=Tom|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2011/11/28/worlds-top-muslims-list-appears-with-erdogan-only-3-who-should-it-be/|title=World’s top Muslims list appears with Erdogan only #3.

===2012 edition===
In 2012, the edition was published by [[S. Abdallah Schleifer]], Professor Emeritus and Senior Fellow [[Kamal Adham]] Center for Television &amp; Digital Journalism, [[The American University in Cairo]].&lt;ref name="watchdogwire"/&gt;

There were more Muslims from America than any other country again with 41 spots on the 500 list. Countries with the next highest number of names were Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom, with 25 Muslims each, followed by Indonesia, with 24.&lt;ref name="deseretnews"&gt;{{cite news |last=Renouard|first=Chelynne|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765616747/US-dominates-list-of-worlds-500-Most-Influential-Muslims.html|title=U.S. dominates list of world’s ’500 Most Influential Muslims’|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Deseret News]]''|date=December 3, 2012|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lists the winners according to 13 categories, including spiritual guides, Quran reciters, scholars, politicians, celebrities, sports figures, radicals, and media leaders.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sacirbey|first=Omar|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/29/worlds-500-most-influential-muslims-2012_n_2208667.html|title=World's '500 Most Influential Muslims' 2012 Dominated By U.S.|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|date=November 29, 2012|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sacirbey|first=Omar|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-11-28/national/35511535_1_nihad-awad-muslim-women-lawyers-azizah-al-hibri|title=World's '500 Most Influential Muslims' 2012 Dominated By U.S.|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=November 28, 2012|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the fourth year running, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list. He was followed by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at second place.&lt;ref name="ciibroadcasting1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moosa|first=Ebrahim|url=http://www.ciibroadcasting.com/2012/12/04/nine-south-africans-on-500-most-influential-muslims-list/|title=Nine South Africans on 500 Most Influential Muslims list|work= |location= |publisher=''Cii Broadcasting''|date=December 4, 2012|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan's advance gave him advantage over Moroccan King Mohammed VI who took the third place. Fourth place went to Dr [[Mohammed Badie]], whose name appeared in the top 10 for the first time. He was followed by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani who took the fifth place. Sheikh Al-Azhar Dr. [[Ahmed el-Tayeb|Ahmad el-Tayeb]] and prominent Islamic scholar Dr. [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] who is President of Global Association of Muslim Scholars, also made it to the top 10 ranks.&lt;ref name="onislam2"/&gt;

''The Clarinet Projected'' reported that they considered seven of the top ten to be "[[Islamism|Islamists]]".&lt;ref name="clarionproject"&gt;{{cite news |last=Munro|first=Ryan|url=http://www.clarionproject.org/analysis/7-top-10-world%E2%80%99s-most-influential-muslims-are-islamists|title=7 of Top 10 'World’s Most Influential Muslims' Are Islamists|work= |location= |publisher=''The Clarion Project''|date=December 3, 2012|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013/14 edition===
In 2013, the list was edited once again by Professor Emeritus S. Abdallah Schleifer of the American University in Cairo.&lt;ref name="prnewswire2"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/influencing-muslims-the-500-most-influential-muslims-234026621.html|title=Influencing Muslims: The 500 Most Influential Muslims|work= |location= |publisher=''[[PR Newswire]]''|date=December 2, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top of the list went to Sheikh [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]], the Grand Sheikh of the Al Azhar University for the prominent role played by him in Egypt's troubled democratic transition&lt;ref name="ciibroadcasting2"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.ciibroadcasting.com/2013/11/27/2013-list-of-worlds-most-influential-muslims-released/|title=2013 list of ‘World’s Most Influential Muslims’ released|work= |location= |publisher=''Cii Broadcasting''|date=November 27, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His astute decision making over the past couple of years has preserved the traditional approach of Al-Azhar which faced threats from Islamists and Salafis in the years that have followed Mubarak's fall.&lt;ref name="newswire"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1272211/influencing-muslims-the-500-most-influential-muslims|title=Influencing Muslims: The 500 Most Influential Muslims|work= |location= |publisher=''[[CNW Group]]''|date=December 2, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His public support of General [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]'s coup also gave it a strong religious grounding that was necessary for it to achieve the legitimacy needed to prevent a civil war, effectively making him a "king-maker" and cementing his place at the top of the list.&lt;ref name="prnewswire2"/&gt; He was followed on the listing by Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud and Iranian Grand Leader Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei.&lt;ref name="ciibroadcasting2"/&gt;

Reflective of the wider trajectory of the Arab Spring, this year's list showed a decline in influence from [[Muslim Brotherhood]] associated figures Dr Mohammed Badie, Sheikh Yusuf al Qaradawi and ousted Egyptian President [[Mohamed Morsi]]. Coup kingpin General [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] who was previously unlisted now ranks at 29.&lt;ref name="ciibroadcasting2"/&gt;

The US dominates the list again with 41 inclusions including [[Muhammad Ali]], Dr [[Mehmet Oz]], Rep. [[Keith Ellison]], Yasiin Bey ([[Mos Def]]), and [[Fareed Zakaria]]. Representing the UK are [[Mo Farah]], [[Cat Stevens|Yusuf Islam]], Riz Khan, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, Cambridge's Dr Timothy Winter and 18 others.&lt;ref name="newswire"/&gt;

===2014/2015 edition===
In 2014, the chief editor of the list was again Professor S Abdallah Schleifer. The top spot went back to Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, due to his being the "absolute monarch of the most powerful Arab nation." The list accords him the place in light of Saudi Arabia being home to Islam's two holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, which millions of Muslims visit throughout the year, as well as the kingdom's oil exports. Rounding out the top three are Dr Muhammad Ahmed al-Tayeb, grand sheikh of Al-Azhar University and grand imam of Al-Azhar mosque, and Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The top nine are all political leaders and royals, including Morocco's King Mohammed VI and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.&lt;ref name="alarabiya"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ansari|first=Saffiya|url=http://www.english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/features/2014/10/03/Politics-to-pop-royalty-World-s-500-influential-Muslims-unveiled.html|title=Politics to pop royalty: World’s 500 influential Muslims unveiled|work= |location= |publisher=''Al Arabiya News''|date=October 3, 2014|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top 50 fit into six broad categories: 12 are political leaders (kings, generals, presidents), four are spiritual leaders (Sufi shaykhs), 14 are national or international religious authorities, three are "preachers", six are high-level scholars, 11 are leaders of movements or organizations. In total 72 Americans are among the 500 most influential Muslims, a disproportionately strong showing, but only one among the top 50, Sheikh Hamza Yusuf Hanson of Zaytuna Institute listed at number 38.&lt;ref name="muslimmedianetwork"/&gt;

===2016 edition===
In 2015, the top 50 was again dominated by religious scholars and heads of state. The top five, was King Abdullah of Jordan; Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand sheikh of Egypt's Al-Azhar University; [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman]] of Saudi Arabia; Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and King Mohammed VI of Morocco. Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan came in at Number eight, but surprisingly Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] did not make the Top 50 this year or last, though he is still listed in the 500. The prime minister of Iraq did not make the list, but Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Hussein Sistani did, coming in at number nine.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Harbin|first=Julie Poucher|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americans-dominate-list-of-the-worlds-500-most-influential-muslims_561c1656e4b028dd7ea4bb8c|title=World's 500 Most Influential Muslims Highlights Muslim-American Influence|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|date=October 12, 2015|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since at least 2012, the U.S. has outpaced nations with a far larger Muslim population, with at least 40 notable people of influence, with Pakistan (33), Saudi Arabia (32), Egypt (27) and the UK (27).&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2"/&gt;

&lt;!--THIS ARTICLE IS WRITTEN IN BRITISH ENGLISH, WHICH TREATS COLLECTIVE NOUNS LIKE "BAND" AS PLURALS (i.e. "The Waterboys" ARE a band"). PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS.--&gt;

'''The Waterboys''' are a [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-[[Irish people|Irish]] folk rock band formed in [[Edinburgh]] in 1983 by Scottish musician [[Mike Scott (musician)|Mike Scott]]. The band's membership, past and present, has been composed mainly of musicians from Scotland. Mike Scott has remained as the only constant member throughout the band's career. They have explored a number of different styles, but their music is mainly a mix of [[folk music]] with [[rock and roll]]. They dissolved in 1993 when Scott departed to pursue a solo career. They reformed in 2000, and continue to release albums and tour worldwide. Scott emphasises a continuity between The Waterboys and his solo work, saying that "To me there's no difference between Mike Scott and the Waterboys; they both mean the same thing. They mean myself and whoever are my current travelling musical companions."&lt;ref name="amgweary"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rock in the Weary Land review|publisher=AllMusic|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r507464|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=22 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Waterboys sound was dubbed "The Big Music" after a song on their second album, ''[[A Pagan Place]]''. This style was described by Scott as "a metaphor for seeing God's signature in the world."&lt;ref name="poets"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Big Music' of the Waterboys: Song, Revelry, and Celebration|url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5815|accessdate=22 October 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024211804/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5815|archivedate=24 October 2005|df=dmy-all}} This article appeared as part of the Academy of American Poets' web-based National Poetry Almanac's 2004 "Poetry and Music" series. The author is unidentified. See {{cite web|title=Poetry and Music|work=National Poetry Almanac|url=http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/198|accessdate=1 December 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051117010344/http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/198|archive-date=17 November 2005|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} for more information about the series.&lt;/ref&gt;  Waterboys chronicler Ian Abrahams elaborated on this by defining "The Big Music" as, "...a mystical celebration of paganism. It's extolling the basic and primitive divinity that exists in everything ('the oceans and the sand'), religious and spiritual all encompassing. Here is something that can't be owned or built upon, something that has its existence in the concept of Mother Earth and has an ancestral approach to religion. And it takes in and embraces the feminine side of divinity, pluralistic in its acceptance of the wider pantheon of paganism."&lt;ref&gt;Strange Boat: Mike Scott &amp; The Waterboys by Ian Abrahams (2007) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Big Music" either influenced or was used to describe a number of other bands specializing in an anthemic sound, including [[U2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/mar/27/timetorediscoverthewaterbo|title=Time to rediscover the Waterboys|last=McGee|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan McGee|date=27 March 2008|website=theguardian.com|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simple Minds]], [[In Tua Nua]], [[Big Country]] and [[Hothouse Flowers]].&lt;ref name="furia"&gt;{{cite web|title=6 Echoes of The Big Music|url=http://www.furia.com/page.cgi?type=twas&amp;id=twas0006|accessdate=22 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 1980s, the band became significantly more folk influenced. The Waterboys eventually returned to rock and roll, and have released both rock and folk albums since reforming.

==History==
The Waterboys have gone through three distinct phases. Their early years, or "Big Music" period was followed by a folk music period which was characterised by an emphasis on touring over album production and by a large band membership, leading to the description of the group as a "Raggle Taggle band".&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ |work=mikescottwaterboys |url=http://www.mikescottwaterboys.com/mikescottwaterboys/mainframes.asp?file=News/faq.htm |accessdate=28 October 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411043725/http://www.mikescottwaterboys.com/mikescottwaterboys/mainframes.asp?file=News%2Ffaq.htm |archivedate=11 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief return to the "Big Music" for one tour&lt;ref name="rc"&gt;{{cite web | author=Peter Anderson | title=Mike Scott/Waterboys biography | work=Record Collector | url=http://www.phpwebspace.net/waterboys/biog/pageone.htm | accessdate=22 October 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050503130512/http://www.phpwebspace.net/waterboys/biog/pageone.htm |archivedate = 3 May 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the release of a mainstream rock and roll album with ''[[Dream Harder]]'', the band dissolved until its rebirth in 2000. In the years since, the band has revisited both rock and folk music, and continues to tour and release studio albums.

=== Formation ===
Scott, the founder and only permanent member of The Waterboys, made a number of solo recordings in late 1981 and early 1982 while in a band named Another Pretty Face (later called Funhouse). These sessions at Redshop Studio are the earliest recordings that would be released under The Waterboys name. During the same period, Scott formed the short-lived band The Red and the Black, with saxophone player [[Anthony Thistlethwaite]], after hearing him play on ''Waiting on Egypt'', a [[Nikki Sudden]] album. The Red and the Black performed nine concerts in London.&lt;ref name="a1978"&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive 1978–85 |publisher=mikescottwaterboys.com |url=http://www.mikescottwaterboys.com/mikescottwaterboys/mainframes.asp?file=archive/index.htm |accessdate=28 October 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003427/http://www.mikescottwaterboys.com/mikescottwaterboys/mainframes.asp?file=archive%2Findex.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thistlethwaite introduced Scott to drummer [[Kevin Wilkinson]], who joined The Red and the Black. During 1982, Scott made a number of recordings, both solo and with Thistlethwaite and Wilkinson. These recording sessions, both of Scott's solo work and the group performances, would later be divided between The Waterboys' first and second albums.

In 1983, even though Scott's record label, [[Ensign Records]], expected his first album to be a solo effort,&lt;ref name="albumnotes"&gt;{{cite book | first=Mike | last=Scott | year=2002 | title=The Waterboys | chapter=Recording Notes | page=2 | publisher=EMI }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott decided to start a new band. He chose The Waterboys as its name from a line in the [[Lou Reed]] song "The Kids" on the album ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]''.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; In March 1983, Ensign released the first recording under the new band name, a [[music single|single]] titled ''A Girl Called Johnny'', the A-side of which was a tribute to [[Patti Smith]]. This was followed in May by The Waterboys' first performance as a group, on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Old Grey Whistle Test]]''. The BBC performance included a new member, keyboard player [[Karl Wallinger]].&lt;ref name="a1978" /&gt; The Waterboys released their self-titled debut, ''[[The Waterboys (album)|The Waterboys]]'', in July 1983. Their music, influenced by Patti Smith, [[Bob Dylan]] and [[David Bowie]], was compared by critics to [[Van Morrison]] and [[U2]] in its cinematic sweep.&lt;ref name="amgwat"&gt;A comparison which continues to be made.

After the release of their debut The Waterboys began touring. Their first show was at the [[Batschkapp]] Club in [[Frankfurt]] in February 1984. The band then consisted of Mike Scott on vocals and guitar, Anthony Thistlethwaite on saxophone and [[mandolin]], Wallinger on keyboards, [[Roddy Lorimer]] on trumpets, Martyn Swain on bass and [[Kevin Wilkinson]] on drums. John Caldwell from Another Pretty Face also played guitar, and Scottish singer [[Eddi Reader]] sang backing vocals for the band's first two concerts.&lt;ref name="a1978" /&gt; The band made some new recordings and over-dubbed old material in late 1983 and early 1984 which were released as The Waterboys' second album, ''[[A Pagan Place]]'', in June 1984.  The "official" Waterboys line-up at this time, according to the sleeve of ''A Pagan Place'', was Scott, Thistlethwaite, Wallinger and Wilkinson, with guest contributions from Reader, Lorimer and many others.

''A Pagan Place'' was preceded by the single ''The Big Music''.  "The Big Music", the name of the single's A-side track, was adopted by some commentators as a description of The Waterboys' sound, and is still used to refer to the musical style of their first three albums. The release of the album was followed by further touring including support for [[The Pretenders]] and U2 and a show at the [[Glastonbury Festival]].

The band began to record new material in early 1985 for a new album, with Wilkinson leaving the band to join [[China Crisis]]. Late in the sessions future Waterboy [[Steve Wickham]] added his violin to the track ''The Pan Within''; he had been invited after Scott had heard him on a [[Sinéad O'Connor]] demo recorded at Karl Wallinger's house.&lt;ref name="a1978" /&gt;

The Waterboys (officially a trio of Scott, Thistlethwaite and Wallinger with a slew of guests) released their third album, ''[[This Is the Sea]]'', in October 1985. It sold better than either of the two earlier albums, and managed to get into the Top Forty. A single from it, "[[The Whole of the Moon]]", reached number 26 in the UK. Promotion efforts were hampered by Scott's refusal to perform on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', which insisted that its performers [[lip sync]].&lt;ref name="rc" /&gt; (However, in Southeast Asia, particularly in the [[Philippines]], when the New Wave era started around this period, the group's biggest hit single out of this third album was "The Pan Within", aside from "The Whole of the Moon" and "Don't Bang The Drum".) The album release was followed by successful tours of the UK and North America with Wickham becoming a full-time member, Marco Sin replacing Martyn Swain on bass, and [[Chris Whitten]] replacing Kevin Wilkinson on drums. Towards the end of the tour Wallinger left to form his own band, [[World Party]], and was replaced by [[Guy Chambers]]. At the same time, drummer Dave Ruffy replaced Chris Whitten.

=== Late 1980s: The Raggle Taggle band ===
At the invitation of new member Steve Wickham, Mike Scott moved to Dublin and quickly became influenced by the [[Music of Ireland|traditional Irish music]] there as well as by [[Country music|country]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]].&lt;ref name="pap"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gerry Galipault |title=Mike Scott is The Waterboys and The Waterboys Are Mike Scott |work=Pause and Play |url=http://www.pauseandplay.com/waterboys.htm |accessdate=22 October 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319150108/http://www.pauseandplay.com/waterboys.htm |archivedate=19 March 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's line-up changed once again with Scott, Wickham and Thistlethwaite now joined by [[Trevor Hutchinson]] on bass and Peter McKinney on drums. The new band, which the official Waterboys' website refers to as the "Raggle Taggle band" line-up,&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; spent 1986 and 1987 recording in Dublin and touring the UK, Ireland, Europe and Israel. Some of these performances were released in 1998 on ''[[The Live Adventures of the Waterboys]]'', including a famous Glastonbury performance in 1986.

In 1988 Scott took the band to [[Spiddal]] in the west of Ireland where they set up a recording studio in Spiddal House to finish recording their new album. ''[[Fisherman's Blues]]'' was released in October 1988 and showcased many guest musicians that had played with the band in Dublin and Spiddal. Critics and fans were split between those embracing the new influence of Irish and Scottish folk music and others disappointed after hoping for a continuation of the style of ''This Is the Sea''. ''World Music: The Rough Guide'' notes that "some cynics claim that Scotsman Mike Scott gave Irish music back to the Irish... his impact can't be underestimated",&lt;ref name="wmtrg"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Broughton, Simon | author2=Ellingham, Mark | last-author-amp=yes | year=1999 | title=World Music: the Rough Guide Volume 1 | page=188 | publisher=Rough Guides, Ltd. | url=http://print.google.com/print?id=gyiTOcnb2yYC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=%22The+Waterboys%22+%22Mike+Scott%22&amp;prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fq%3D%2522The%2BWaterboys%2522%2B%2522Mike%2BScott%2522&amp;sig=O-_M4a7cb99D0lmJdLREj2bt4kw&amp;auth=DQAAAG8AAADk2VL-koPPNNbNrFjUJgkCU0gokpLWQzRdG8Le3HmUniJSpMo3HQ7sFJQeeJABAwSBcsR0NDsiCGK3AWHqVh8-P4qc7biLAyyKIT5EMddlc9WnFs6G9qAYwhD-xvcCcOeOK4QtAUV3t2Oi-ktyexYj | isbn=1-85828-635-2 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Scott himself explains that it was the Irish tradition that influenced him; "I was in love with Ireland. Every day was a new adventure, it was mythical... Being part of a brotherhood of musicians was a great thing in those days, with all the many musicians of all stripes we befriended in Ireland. I still have that connection to the Irish musicians and tap into it..."&lt;ref name="mstcth"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mike Talks | work=mikescottwaterboys | url=http://www.mikescottwaterboys.com/mikescottwaterboys/heaven/mike.html | accessdate=1 December 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523001237/http://www.mikescottwaterboys.com/mikescottwaterboys/heaven/mike.html | archivedate=23 May 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the large number of tracks that were recorded in the three years between ''This Is the Sea'' and ''Fisherman's Blues'', The Waterboys released a second album of songs from this period in 2001, titled ''[[Too Close to Heaven]]'' (or ''Fisherman's Blues, Part 2'' in North America), and more material was released as bonus tracks for the 2006 reissue of the remastered ''Fisherman's Blues'' album.

After further touring the band returned to Spiddal to record a new album. The Waterboys now consisted of Mike Scott, Steve Wickham, Anthony Thistlethwaite, Colin Blakey on whistle, flute and piano, [[Sharon Shannon]] on accordion, Trevor Hutchinson on bass and Noel Bridgeman on drums. Their fifth album, ''[[Room to Roam]]'' was released in September 1990. One of the album's tracks was a recording of the traditional ballad "[[The Raggle Taggle Gypsy]]".

Just before ''Room to Roam'' was released, Wickham left over a disagreement with Scott and Thistlethwaite regarding the future direction of the band's sound. Scott and Thistlethwaite wanted to move the band back to a more rock and roll style, and Wickham disagreed.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; His departure started the band's dissolution, and in his wake Shannon and Blakey both left. Scott, Thistlethwaite and Hutchinson recruited Ken Blevins on drums to fulfil the group's tour dates.

=== End and return of the Waterboys ===
Trevor Hutchinson left the band in 1991, a year that also saw a re-release of the single "The Whole of the Moon" from ''This Is the Sea''. The single reached number three on the United Kingdom charts. Scott spent the rest of the year writing new material and moved to New York. Thistlethwaite left the band in December, leaving Mike Scott as The Waterboys' only member. The next album was completed with session musicians and was released in 1993 as ''Dream Harder'' with a new [[hard rock]]-influenced sound, and produced two UK Top 30 singles ('The Return of Pan' and 'Glastonbury Song'). Frustrated by not being able to get a new touring Waterboys band together, Scott left New York, abandoning the "Waterboys" name and embarking upon a solo career.

However, Scott later resurrected the Waterboys name, citing its recognition amongst fans, for the 2000 album ''[[A Rock in the Weary Land]]''. The album had a new, experimental rock sound, inspired by contemporary bands [[Radiohead]] and [[Beck]] that "shocked" some listeners.&lt;ref name="pap" /&gt; Scott described the new sound as "Sonic Rock".&lt;ref name="amgweary" /&gt; A number of old Waterboys guested on the album including Thistlethwaite and Wilkinson. By 2001 the core of the new Waterboys included Mike Scott on vocals and guitar, [[Richard Naiff]] on keyboards and [[Organ (music)|organs]] and Wickham, who had returned to the band, on violin. The group changed direction once again in 2003 and released ''[[Universal Hall]]'' a mostly acoustic album with a return of some Celtic influences from the ''Fisherman's Blues'' era. The album was followed by a tour of the UK and then Europe. Their first official live album, ''[[Karma to Burn (The Waterboys album)|Karma to Burn]]'', was released in 2005. A new studio album, ''[[Book of Lightning]]'', was released 2 April 2007.

=== ''An Appointment With Mr. Yeats'' ===
Having harboured the idea for 20 years, Mike Scott set 20 [[W.B. Yeats]] poems to music in an enterprise that evolved into a show entitled ''An Appointment With Mr. Yeats''. The Waterboys held the world premiere from 15 to 20 March 2010 in Yeats's own theatre, the [[Abbey Theatre]], Dublin.&lt;ref name="abbey"&gt;{{cite web | title=Abbey Events | work=Abbey Theatre Home | url=http://www.abbeytheatre.ie/whats_on/event/872 | accessdate=11 April 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205190238/http://www.abbeytheatre.ie/whats_on/event/872 | archivedate=5 December 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-night show quickly sold out, later receiving several rave reviews, among which were [[The Irish Times]]&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Waterboys Present: An Appointment with Mr Yeats |work=The Irish Times | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2010/0317/1224266439778.html | accessdate=11 April 2010 | date=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Irish Actor/Playwright [[Michael Harding]].&lt;ref name="mharding"&gt;{{cite news | title=Fear Not: Heaven is Just Around the Corner | work= Michael Harding The Irish Times | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2010/0326/1224267095005.html| accessdate=11 April 2010 | date=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performances boasted an eclectic mix of musicians that involved Irish rock singer [[Katie Kim (Irish musician)|Katie Kim]],&lt;ref name="kkmspace"&gt;{{cite web | title=Katie Kim on Myspace| publisher=myspace.com | accessdate=11 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish Singer/Writer/Guitarist Joe Chester,&lt;ref name="jcscloud"&gt;{{cite web | title=Joe Chester on Soundcloud| publisher=soundcloud.com| url=http://soundcloud.com/joe-chester | accessdate=18 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Simon Wallace (keyboards).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt; Some of  the poems performed include  'The Hosting of the Sidhe', '[[The Lake Isle of Innisfree]]', 'News for the Delphic Oracle', and 'The Song of Wandering Aengus', along with an amalgamation of two Yeats lyrics that became the song 'Let the Earth Bear Witness' which Scott&lt;ref name="msinews"&gt;{{cite web| title=Waterboys news updates| work=mikescottwaterboys| url=http://www.mikescottwaterboys.com/mikescottwaterboys/News/index.php| accessdate=11 April 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330073945/http://www.mikescottwaterboys.com/mikescottwaterboys/News/index.php| archivedate=30 March 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; had produced during 'The Sea of Green'&lt;ref name="sogreen"&gt;{{cite news | title=Guardian Sea of Green | work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2009/jun/17/iran-uprising| accessdate=11 April 2010 | location=London | first1=Matthew | last1=Weaver | first2=Daniel | last2=Nasaw | date=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2009 Iranian election protests]]. The musical arrangements for the poems were varied and experimental.
On the band's website Scott described the arrangements as "psychedelic, intense, kaleidescopic, a mix of rock, folk and faery music,"&lt;ref name="msyeats"&gt;{{cite web| title=Waterboys news yeats| work=mikescottwaterboys| url=http://www.mikescottwaterboys.com/mikescottwaterboys/News/index.php| accessdate=11 April 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330073945/http://www.mikescottwaterboys.com/mikescottwaterboys/News/index.php| archivedate=30 March 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the delivery of which signals yet another musical shift in the ever mutable world of The Waterboys.

''An Appointment With Mr. Yeats'' returned to Dublin on 7 November 2010 in the city's [[Grand Canal Theatre]].&lt;ref name="gcanal"&gt;{{cite web | title=Grand Canal, Waterboys, November 7, 2010| work=Grand Canal Web| url= http://www.grandcanaltheatre.ie/eventDetail.aspx?mid=188&amp;eventId=64 | accessdate=11 April 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was performed at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican Hall, London]] in February 2011. The [[An Appointment with Mr Yeats|album version]] of ''An Appointment With Mr. Yeats'' was released on 19 September 2011&lt;ref name="inewsy"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Waterboys: An Appointment With Mr Yeats – Review | publisher=BBC Music| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/dxgw| date=6 September 2011 | accessdate=8 October 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached the UK Top 30.

== Modern Blues ==
In October 2014, the band announced a new album ''Modern Blues'', which was first released on 19 January 2015 in the United Kingdom, and was released on April 7 in North America.&lt;ref name=uncut_modernblues&gt;{{cite web|title=The Waterboys share first track from new album, Modern Blues|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/the-waterboys/the-waterboys-share-first-track-from-new-album-modern-blues-news|website=Uncut|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was recorded in [[Nashville]], and produced by Mike Scott and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. The line up includes Paul Brown, David Hood, Ralph Salmins, Zach Ernst, and Steve Wickham.  The first UK single from the Modern Blues album was 'November Tale'.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uncut.co.uk/the-waterboys/the-waterboys-share-first-track-from-new-album-modern-blues-news The Waterboys share first track from new album, Modern Blues]".

=== Sound ===
The Waterboys' music can be divided into three distinct styles. The first is represented by the first three albums, released between 1983 and 1985. The band's arrangements during this period, described by Allmusic as a "rich, dramatic sound... majestic",&lt;ref name="amgbio"&gt;{{cite web | title=Allmusic biography | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5794/biography|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate=3 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically referred to as "The Big Music", combined the rock and roll sound of early U2 with elements of classical trumpet (Lorimer), jazz saxophone (Thistlethwaite) and contemporary keyboards (Wallinger). Scott emphasised the arrangement's fullness by using production techniques similar to [[Phil Spector]]'s "[[Wall of Sound]]". The archetypal example, the song "The Big Music", gave the style its name, but the best-selling example was "[[The Whole of the Moon]]", the song that the early-1980s Waterboys are best known for and that demonstrates both Wallinger's [[synthpop]] keyboard effects and the effectiveness of the [[brass instruments|brass]] section of the band.

&lt;br /&gt;
After Wickham's joining and the move to Ireland, the band went three years before releasing another album.  ''Fisherman's Blues'', and more particularly ''Room to Roam'', traded "The Big Music"'s keyboards and brass for traditional instruments such as tin whistle, flute, fiddle, accordion, harmonica, and [[bouzouki]]. Celtic folk music replaced rock as the main inspiration for song arrangements on both albums.  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' describes the sound as "an impressive mixture of rock music and Celtic ruralism..., Beatles and [[Donovan]] echoes and, of course, lots of grand guitar, fiddle, mandolin, whistle, flute and accordion playing".&lt;ref name="rsrtr"&gt;{{cite web | title=Room to Roam review | work=Rolling Stone | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/231442/thewaterboys?pageid=rs.ArtistDiscography&amp;pageregion=triple1&amp;rnd=1131074756801&amp;has-player=false | accessdate=3 November 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071101072420/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/231442/thewaterboys?pageid=rs.ArtistDiscography&amp;pageregion=triple1&amp;rnd=1131074756801&amp;has-player=false |archivedate = 1 November 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional folk songs were recorded along with those written by Scott.  "The Raggle Taggle Gypsy", a British folk ballad at least two hundred years old, was recorded on ''Room to Roam''. It became closely associated with the band, much as the song "The Big Music" did, and also gave its name to describe the band's character. The recording emphasises how distinctly different the band's music had become in the five years since the last of "The Big Music" albums.

&lt;br /&gt;
After the break-up of the "Raggle Taggle band", Scott used The Waterboys' name for ''Dream Harder'' and ''A Rock in the Weary Land''. These two albums, separated by seven years and bookending Scott's solo album releases, were both rock albums but with distinctive approaches to that genre.  ''Dream Harder'' was described as "disappointingly mainstream",&lt;ref name="othervoices"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mike Scott | work=Chicago Other Voices Poetry | url=http://othervoicespoetry.org/vol8/scott/bio.html | accessdate=2 November 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630103833/http://othervoicespoetry.org/vol8/scott/bio.html | archivedate=30 June 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the sound of the ''A Rock in the Weary Land'' was inspired by [[alternative music]] and was praised by critics.&lt;ref name="amgweary" /&gt; For 2003's ''Universal Hall'', however, Wickham had once again rejoined the band, and that album saw a return of the acoustic folk instrumentation of the late 1980s Waterboys, with the exception of the song "Seek the Light", which is instead an idiosyncratic [[Electronic body music|EBM]] track.

=== Literary influences ===
[[Image:Mike Scott with book in Antwerp 2004.jpg|left|thumb|Scott reads aloud from [[Hafez (poet)|Hafez]]' ''The Gift'' at a Waterboys concert in Antwerp in 2004. Waterboys' concerts often feature readings from the Sufi poet's work.&lt;ref name="OneWorld"&gt;{{cite web | title=One World peace concert | publisher=EdinburghGuide.com | url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/aande/music/review.shtml?06_03/06_02_18_one_world_peace_concert | accessdate=16 January 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522195240/http://www.edinburghguide.com/aande/music/review.shtml?06_03%2F06_02_18_one_world_peace_concert | archivedate=22 May 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Scott, who briefly studied literature and philosophy at the [[University of Edinburgh]], has made heavy use of English literature in his music. The Waterboys have recorded poems set to music by writers including [[William Butler Yeats]] ("[[The Stolen Child]]" and "Love and Death"), [[George MacDonald]] ("Room to Roam"), and [[Robert Burns]] ("Ever to Be Near Ye"). A member of the [[Academy of American Poets]] writes that "The Waterboys' gift lies in locating Burns and Yeats within a poetic tradition of song, revelry, and celebration, re-invigorating their verses with the energy of contemporary music". So close is the identification of the Waterboys with their literary influences that the writer also remarks that "W.B.", the initials to which Yeats' first and middle names are often shortened, could also stand for "Waterboys".&lt;ref name="poets" /&gt; The Waterboys returned to W.B. Yeats in March 2010. Having arranged 20 of his poems to music, the band performed them as ''[[#An Appointment With Mr Yeats|An Appointment With Mr Yeats]]'' for five nights at the [[Abbey Theatre]], Dublin (which Yeats co-founded in 1904).&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news| title=Why Poetry and pop are not Such Strange Bedfellows| work=The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/11/poetry-pop-yeats-auden | accessdate=11 April 2010 | location=London | first=Graeme | last=Thomson | date=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott has also a number of poetic tropes in lyrics, including [[anthropomorphism]] (e.g. "Islandman"), [[metaphor]] (e.g. "A Church Not Made with Hands", "The Whole of the Moon"), and [[metonymy]] (e.g. "Old England"). The latter song quotes from both Yeats and [[James Joyce]]. While the lyrics of the band have explored a large number of themes, [[symbol]]ic references to water are especially prominent. Water is often referenced in their songs (e.g. "This Is the Sea", "Strange Boat", "Fisherman's Blues"). The Waterboys' logo, first seen on the album cover of ''The Waterboys'', symbolises waves.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

=== Spirituality ===
The Waterboys' lyrics show influences from different spiritual traditions.  The first is the romantic [[Neopaganism]] and [[esotericism]] of authors such as Yeats and [[Dion Fortune]], which can be observed in the repeated references to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] deity [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] in both "The Pan Within" and "The Return of Pan". Pan was also featured on the album art for ''Room to Roam''.  "Medicine Bow", a song from the recording sessions for ''This Is the Sea'', refers to Native American spirituality in its use of the word "medicine" to mean spiritual power. Scott's interest in Native American issues is also demonstrated in his preliminary recordings for the group's debut album, which included the songs "Death Song of the Sioux Parts One &amp; Two" and "Bury My Heart". "Bury My Heart" is a reference to [[Dee Brown (novelist)|Dee Brown]]'s ''[[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee]]''.&lt;ref name="Benet"&gt;The phrase "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" is originally from [[Stephen Vincent Benet]]'s poem "American Names".&lt;/ref&gt; a history of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans in the western United States]]. Scott took the traditional [[Sioux music|Sioux song]] "The Earth Only Endures" from ''Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee'', and set it to new music; the arrangement appears on ''The Secret Life of the Waterboys''.  Christian imagery can be seen in the songs "December" from ''The Waterboys'', "The Christ in You" on ''Universal Hall'', and indirectly in the influence of C. S. Lewis in a number of other songs, but Scott writes that his lyrics are not influenced by Christianity.

Scott has also said, "I've always been interested in spirituality, and I've never joined any religion. And it really turns me off when people from one religion say theirs is the only way. And I believe all religions are just different ways to spirituality. And if you call that [[universalism|universality]], well, then I'm all for it."&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{cite web | title=Waterboys Express Spirituality | work=Chicago Innerview | url=http://www.chicagoinnerview.com/archives/dec03_waterboys.htm | accessdate=29 October 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060211040508/http://www.chicagoinnerview.com/archives/dec03_waterboys.htm |archivedate = 11 February 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Scott's [[Religious pluralism|pluralist]] perspective, The Waterboys have been labelled as "[[Christian rock]]" by some reviewers and heathens by some Christians .&lt;ref name="pm"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Waterboys concert review | work=Pop Matters | url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/concerts/w/waterboys.shtml | accessdate=29 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Steve Wickham The Hague 2002 3.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Steve Wickham, the band's fiddler, played an especially important role in the band's direction.]]
Over seventy musicians have performed live as a Waterboy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/MickPuck "67 Waterboys (2)"]. Mike Scott on Twitter. Retrieved 15 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mikescottwaterboys.com/waterboys-members.php "Past and Present Waterboys"]. mikescottwaterboys.com. Retrieved 19 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some have spent only a short time with the band, contributing to a single tour or album, while others have been long-term members with significant contributions. Scott has been the band's lead vocalist, motivating force, and principal songwriter throughout the group's history, but a number of other musicians are closely identified with the band.

[[Anthony Thistlethwaite]] was an original member of the band, and remained a member until 1991 when the band broke up, although he also joined a few recording sessions for ''A Rock in the Weary Land''. After Scott and Wickham, Thistlethwaite has more songwriting credits than any other Waterboy. His saxophone, regularly featured in solos, was one half of the early group's distinctive brass section, but he has also played guitar, keyboards and a number of other instruments for the band. He pressed to return The Waterboys to a rock music sound after ''Room to Roam'', but did not appear on ''Dream Harder'', the result of that decision. He is now a member of [[The Saw Doctors]], and has also released three solo albums.

Original member [[Kevin Wilkinson]] was the band's drummer from 1983–1984, and continued to play in some studio sessions afterwards. His later appeared on ''A Rock in the Weary Land''. He led the rhythm section of the group during its "Big Music" phase, sometimes without the assistance of any bass guitar. Scott describes Wilkinson's drumming as "bright and angular, an unusual sound".&lt;ref name="tits" /&gt;

[[Karl Wallinger]] joined the group in 1983, shortly after its formation. He left the group two years later, but in that relatively short period made important contributions to both ''A Pagan Place'' and ''This Is the Sea''. He co-wrote "Don't Bang the Drum", the environmentalism anthem on the latter album. His keyboards and synthesiser work expanded the group's sound, and he also did some studio work for demo sessions. Wallinger's [[World Party]] project was heavily influenced by his work with The Waterboys.

[[Roddy Lorimer]]'s participation began in 1983, contributing his trumpet playing "on and off"&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; until 1990. He and Thistlethwaite took turns leading the brass section of the band, and Lorimer was also a featured soloist, most famously on "The Whole of the Moon" and "Don't Bang the Drum". He further contributed backing vocals to the song. His trumpet style is a combination of his classical training with an experimental approach encouraged by Scott.&lt;ref name="khbio"&gt;{{cite web | title=Roddy Lorimer | work=Kick Horns Line Up | url=http://www.kickhorns.com/biog-roddylorimer.html | accessdate=31 October 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024100706/http://www.kickhorns.com/biog-roddylorimer.html | archivedate=24 October 2005 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorimer returned for some studio work in 2006.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

[[Steve Wickham]] transformed the group when he joined in 1985; his interest in folk music directly resulted in the band's change of direction. His initial involvement with The Waterboys ended in 1990 when Scott and Thistlethwaite wanted to return to rock and roll, but Wickham rejoined the group again in 2000, and, as of 2007, continues to perform with the band. Described by Scott as "the world's greatest rock fiddle player",&lt;ref name="intw"&gt;Wickham agrees. {{cite web | title=An interview with Steve Wickham | url=http://www.mikescott.com/mikescottwaterboys/Tours/steve_int.htm | accessdate=22 October 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215064800/http://www.mikescott.com/mikescottwaterboys/Tours/steve_int.htm | archivedate=15 February 2005 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; he has written more songs for the band than anyone other than Scott, including the group's handful of instrumental recordings.
[[Image:Richard Naiff in Antwerp 2003 1.JPG|thumb|After 2000, Richard Naiff became one of the three core band members.]]
[[Richard Naiff]] first recorded with the band in 1999, and joined permanently in 2000. As of 2007, he was a core member, along with Scott and Wickham. He is a classically trained pianist and flautist, and plays keyboards for The Waterboys. [[Ian McNabb]] described him as Scott's "find of the century"&lt;ref name="ktbrep"&gt;{{cite web | title=Karma to Burn reports | work=mikescottwaterboys | url=http://www.mikescott.com/mikescottwaterboys/karmatoburn/karmareports.htm | accessdate=3 November 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012212344/http://www.mikescott.com/mikescottwaterboys/karmatoburn/karmareports.htm | archivedate=12 October 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reviewers have described him as "phenomenally talented".&lt;ref name="cluas"&gt;{{cite web | title=Universal Hall, Findhorn, Scotland, January 2002 | work=Cluas.com Irish music | url=http://www.cluas.com/music/gigs/waterboys.htm | accessdate=30 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Naiff officially left The Waterboys in February 2009 to spend more time with his family.&lt;ref name="msinews" /&gt;

'''Thomas Henty''' (born '''Thomas John Cooper''' 19{{nbsp}}January 1956{{snd}}13{{nbsp}}August 1988) was an English actor, and the son of the magician and [[prop comedian]] [[Tommy Cooper]].

He attended Sutton Court Primary School in [[Chiswick]] ,and [[Latymer Upper School]], [[Hammersmith]] from September 1965.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He went on to appear alongside his father in an episode of the [[Thames Television]] variety series ''London Night Out'' in 1979, as well as in four episodes of the series ''Cooper's Half Hour'' in 1980, also for Thames. He also acted as occasional [[stage manager]] to his father,{{sfn|Fisher|2009|p=371}} and was backstage when Cooper died in front of a live television audience at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] on 15{{nbsp}}April 1984.

In addition to his work with his father, Henty was an actor in his own right. His desire to make his own mark in the field was behind his decision to adopt his mother's maiden name. In an archive interview with the television personality [[Frank Bough]], included in the ITV documentary ''The Unforgettable Tommy Cooper'' (2001), Henty said that he did not want people in the acting profession to know that he was Cooper's son. Henty made appearances in episodes of the television series ''[[Robin of Sherwood]]'' (1984) and ''[[Just Good Friends]]'' (1986), as well as the film ''[[Bellman and True]]'' (1987).

His role in ''Bellman and True'' was his last. In 1988 Henty's marriage collapsed after seven years. He died on 13 August 1988, aged 32, of [[haemophilia]], following complications caused by [[liver failure]]. Doctors had attempted to pump seventy pints of new blood into his body, but the blood failed to clot and after three days his mother took the decision to have his life support machine switched off,{{sfn|Fisher|2009|p=419}} four years after his father's death. He left a six-year-old son, Tam Henty (born in 1982).

==Biography==
Born to a Scots Irish and English father and a Mexican mother, Lansford was raised in a Mexican neighbourhood in [[East Los Angeles (region)|East Los Angeles]].
