'''Abhyanga''' ("oil massage") is a form of [[Ayurvedic]] medicine that involves massage of the body with dosha-specific warm herb infused oils. The oil is usually pre-mixed with herbs for specific conditions.

The Abhyanga is a part of the Dinacharya (daily practices) specified by the [[Brhat Trayi]] and Laghutrayi series of Ayurvedic textbooks to maintain good health and well-being. Proponents claim Abhyanga aids joint health, nourishes the dhatus (tissues of the body) and brings aggravated doshas back to balance. They further claim it improves the condition of dry, coarse hair and flaky skin.

Abhyanga can be done as part of the steps of [[panchakarma]] therapy, especially in the first stage: Purva Karma (pre-treatment), or as its own therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosa|first1=Peterson|title=procedure for Panchakarma|url=http://www.ayurwoman.com.au/abhyanga/o|accessdate=21 November 2015|agency=ayurwoman}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is often followed by [[svedana]] therapy or a warm bath. Abhyanga may be performed by one or more therapists working in sync, but it can also be done by oneself. Oils used can vary depending on the season and the individuals out of balance constitution Vkrtti.

The Abhyanga as prescribed in the Brhtatrayi and Laghutrayi texts is vigorous, and intended to open up the minor Sortas, remove ama (toxins) through the skin, melt kleshma (fat secretions blocking the srotas), and cleanse and moisturize the skin. But Abhyanga can also be used to soothe a Vata imbalance which will bring deep relaxation to the body and a peaceful mind.

'''Anton Wilhelm Amo''' or '''Anthony William Amo''' (c. 1703 – c. 1759) was an African [[philosopher]] from what is now [[Ghana]]. Amo was a teacher at the universities of [[University of Halle|Halle]] and [[University of Jena|Jena]] in [[Germany]] after studying there.  Brought to Germany by the [[Dutch West India Company]] in 1707 as a child, and given as a gift to the Dukes of [[Augustus William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|August Wilhelm]] and [[Louis Rudolph, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ludwig Rudolf von Wolfenbüttel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loutzenhiser|first1=Mike|title=THE ROLE OF THE INDIGENOUS AFRICAN PSYCHE IN THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS|date=September 17, 2008|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=0595503764|pages=xiii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q83RJ_qBwUcC&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=african+precognitive+dreams&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lV92EnQqGu&amp;sig=434fSjJpvWpMyDI5JBk2AsTkPA8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxrPDF6a7KAhWFPiYKHazVBXAQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=african%20precognitive%20dreams&amp;f=false|ref=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/special/amo-anton.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was treated as a member of the family of [[Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], he was the first [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] known to have attended a European [[university]].

==Early life and education==
Amo was a [[Nzema people|Nzema]] (an [[Akan (ethnic group)|Akan]] people). He was born in Awukena in the [[Axim]] region of present-day Ghana, but at the age of about four he was taken to [[Amsterdam]] by the [[Dutch West India Company]]. Some accounts say that he was taken as a [[African slave trade|slave]], others that he was sent to Amsterdam by a preacher working in Ghana. The truth of the matter is that he was given as a "present" to [[Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], to whose palace in [[Wolfenbüttel]] he was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://blackpast.org/gah/amo-anton-wilhelm-1703-1753|title= Amo, Anton Wilhelm|last= Wirth|first= Nikolaus|date= &lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|website= blackpast.org|publisher= BlackPast|access-date= 15 November 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Amo was [[baptism|baptised]] (and later [[confirmation|confirmed]]) in the [[palace]]'s [[chapel]]. He was treated as a member of the Duke's family, and was educated at the [[Wolfenbüttel Ritter-Akademie]] (1717–21) and at the [[University of Helmstedt]] (1721–27).

He went on to the [[University of Halle]], whose Law School he entered in 1727.  He finished his preliminary studies within two years, titling his thesis: ''Dissertatio Inauguralis De Jure Maurorum in Europa'' (1729). This manuscript on ''The Rights of Moors in Europe'' is lost, but a summary was published in his university's ''Annals'' (1730). For his further studies Amo moved to the [[University of Wittenberg]], studying [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[physiology]], [[astronomy]], [[history]], [[law]], [[theology]], [[politics]], and [[medicine]], and mastered six languages (English, French, Dutch, Latin, Greek, and German).  His medical education in particular was to play a central role in much of his later philosophical thought.

He gained his doctorate in philosophy at Wittenberg in 1734; his thesis (published as ''On the Absence of Sensation in the Human Mind and its Presence in our Organic and Living Body'') argued against [[Cartesian dualism]] in favour of a broadly [[materialism|materialist]] account of the person.  He accepted that it is correct to talk of a [[mind]] or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], but argued that it is the [[Human body|body]] rather than the mind which perceives and feels.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever feels, lives; whatever lives, depends on nourishment; whatever lives and depends on nourishment grows; whatever is of this nature is in the end resolved into its basic principles; whatever comes to be resolved into its basic principles is a complex; every complex has its constituent parts; whatever this is true of is a divisible body.  If therefore the human mind feels, it follows that it is a divisible body.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
::::(''On the Ἀπάθεια (Apatheia) of the Human Mind'' 2.1)

==Philosophical career and later life==
Amo returned to the [[University of Halle]] to lecture in philosophy under his preferred name of Antonius Guilelmus Amo Afer. In 1736 he was made a professor.  From his lectures, he produced his second major work in 1738, ''Treatise on the Art of Philosophising Soberly and Accurately'', in which he developed an [[empiricism|empiricist]] epistemology very close to but distinct from that of philosophers such as [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]].  In it he also examined and criticised faults such as intellectual dishonesty, dogmatism, and prejudice.

In 1740 Amo took up a post in philosophy at the [[University of Jena]], but while there he experienced a number of changes for the worse.  The [[Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] had died in 1735, leaving him without his long-standing patron and protector.  That coincided with social changes in Germany, which was becoming intellectually and morally narrower and less liberal.  Those who argued against the secularisation of education (and against the rights of Africans in Europe) were regaining their ascendancy over those (such as [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]) who campaigned for greater academic and social freedom.

Amo was subjected to an unpleasant campaign by some of his enemies, including a public lampoon staged at a theatre in Halle. He finally decided to return to the land of his birth.  He set sail on a [[Dutch West India Company]] ship to Ghana via [[Guinea]], arriving in about 1747; his  father and a sister were still living there. His life from then on becomes more obscure.  According to at least one report, he was taken to a Dutch fortress, [[Fort San Sebastian]] in [[Shama, Ghana|Shama]], in the 1750s, possibly to prevent him sowing dissent among his people.  The exact date, place, and manner of his death are unknown, though he probably died in about 1759 at the fort in Chama in Ghana.

Later, during the time of [[German idealism]] and [[romanticism]], Amo's philosophical work was ignored by other Jena-based German intellectuals such as [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Clemens Brentano|Brentano]], or the [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Der schwarze Philosoph |trans-title=The black Philosopher |language=German |first=Willy |last=Hochkeppel |work=[[Damals]] |issue=12 |year=2012 |pages=66–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aodh Mac Cathmhaoil, O.F.M.''', ([[Latin]]: '''Hugo Cavellus'''; [[Anglicisation|anglicised]]: '''Hugh MacCaghwell''') (1571 – 22 September 1626), was an Irish [[Franciscan]] theologian and [[Archbishop of Armagh]].  He was known by Irish speakers at Louvain by the honorary name ''Aodh Mac Aingil'' ("Mac Aingil" is Irish for "Son of an Angel"), and it was under this title that he published the Irish work ''Scáthán Shacramuinte na hAthridhe''.

==Life==
Mac Cathmhaoil was born at [[Saul, County Down]], and received his earliest education in his native place, trained at one of the [[bardic]] schools still operating in Ulster.&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholics of Ulster: A History'' by Marianne Elliot (pages 75-76)&lt;/ref&gt; He next studied at a famous school in the [[Isle of Man]]. On his return to Ireland, he was hired by [[Hugh O'Neill, The O'Neill]], 2nd Earl of Tyrone, as a tutor to his sons Henry and Hugh.

Mac Cathmhaoil was sent by the Earl as special messenger to the Court of Spain to solicit aid for the Ulster forces. During his stay at [[Salamanca]], where the Court then resided, he frequented the schools of the university and took doctor's degrees in divinity. Soon afterwards he entered the [[Franciscans|Order of Friars Minor]]. He enjoyed a great reputation as a theologian, and his commentaries on the theologian [[Duns Scotus]] (1266–1308) were held in high repute. It was principally due to his great influence at the Spanish Court that the Irish Franciscan College of [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony]] was founded at [[Leuven]] (Louvain).

After his admission into the Order, Mac Cathmhaoil taught for some time in the [[University of Salamanca]]. He was appointed as superior and lecturer at St. Anthony's, [[Leuven]], and moved to Belgium. Among his pupils were [[John Colgan]], [[Patrick Fleming]], [[Aodh Buidhe Mac an Bhaird|Hugh Ward]], and [[Antony Hickey]]. He was summoned to Rome to lecture in the convent of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli|Aracoeli]]; but his energies were not limited to his work as professor. He was employed by the pope on several commissions.

He carried out a papal mission to Ulster in 1613. Over the next three decades, Louvain produced a remarkable outpouring of Gaelic scholarship and devotional texts in Irish. In scouring the north and midlands of Ireland for all available manuscripts, to write an ecclesiastical history of Ireland, his associates ([[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]], a trained historian) and Aodh Mac an Bhaird (Hugh Ward) are credited with saving many of the [[Irish manuscripts]] that still survive. 

Mac Cathmhaoil was elected [[Definitor General]] of the Friars Minor of the Strict Observance, which gave him authority over all the friars in Europe who followed that branch of the Reform within Order. In that capacity, he gave substantial help to Friar [[Luke Wadding]] in founding and developing the [[Sant’Isidoro a Capo le Case|College of San Isidore]] and Ludovisi's [[Pontifical Irish College]] in Rome, for Irish students. On 17 March 1626, [[Pope Urban VIII]], passing over all the other candidates, nominated Mac Aingil as [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]] and [[Primate of All Ireland]]. The consecration took place on 7 June, in the church of St. Isidore. [[Thomas Walsh (archbishop of Cashel)|Thomas Walsh]], [[Archbishop of Cashel]], was consecrated at the same time. The consecrating prelate was Cardinal [[Gabriel Trejo Paniagua|Gabriel de Trejo]], a great friend of the Irish.

Mac Cathmhaoil's health had been much weakened by his duties and the austerities he practised. In making the visitations of the [[ecclesiastical province|provinces]] of the Order, he had always travelled on foot. He also spent much time in prayer and fasting. While preparing for his departure, he caught a fever and died. 

Mac Cathmhaoil was buried in the Church of St. Isidore. His friend [[John O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone]], arranged for a monument to be placed on his grave. The Latin playwright, [[Nicolaus Vernulæus]] (1583–1649), delivered a [[panegyric]] before the university commemorating the virtues and learning of the archbishop, saying that he was conspicuous for his virtues, and that his holiness of life and profound learning made him the miracle of his time. This address was later published in [[Cologne]] in 1657.

==Works==
Mac Cathmhaoil composed four [[Christmas carol]]s in Irish. His major works were in Latin about theology. In his ''Apologia pro Johanne Duns-Scoto'', he engaged in Franciscan defence of [[Duns Scotus]] against the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]-inspired attacks of [[Bzovius]] and [[Cornelius Jansen]], claiming Scotus as an Irishman. He also wrote a work in Irish, which was printed at the Irish press in the college of St. Anthony's, Leuven, in 1618, entitled ''Scáthán Shacramuinte na hAthridhe'', or ''Tractatus de poenitentia et indulgentiis'', that is, ''The Mirror of the Sacrament of Penance''. (The Latin title did not appear in the text and was used only for cataloguing purposes in Latin libraries.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3652">{{gnosticism}}
The '''Archontics''', or '''Archontici''', were a [[Gnostic]] sect that existed in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Armenia]], who arose towards the close of the 2nd century [[Common Era|CE]]. They were thus called from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄρχοντες}}, "principalities", or "rulers", by reason that they held the world to have been created and ruled by malevolent ''[[archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]]''.

[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] seems to be the earliest Christian writer who speaks of this sect. He relates that a young priest in Palestine named Peter had been charged with heresy, deposed from the office of the priesthood and expelled by Bishop [[Aëtius (theologian)|Aëtius]]. He fled into a part of [[Arabia]], where there was a center of [[Ebionites|Ebionitism]]. In his old age, he returned to Palestine, where he lived the life of an [[anchorite]] in a cave near [[Jerusalem]] and attracted followers by the austerity of his life and the practice of extreme poverty. Shortly before the death of [[Constantius II]] (337-361), [[Eutactus]], coming from [[Egypt]], visited the anchorite Peter and was imbued by him with the doctrines of the sect and carried them into Greater and Lesser Armenia.

==Beliefs==
The Archontics held that there were [[Seven Heavens]], ruled by the [[Demiurge]] surrounded by [[archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]] begotten by him, who are the jailers of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s. In the eighth heaven dwells the supreme Mother of light. The king or tyrant of the seventh heaven is [[Sabaoth]], the [[God in Judaism|god of the Jews]], who is the father of the [[Devil]]. The Devil, dwelling upon earth, rebelled against his father, and opposed him in all things, and by [[Eve]] begot [[Cain and Abel]]. Cain slew Abel in a quarrel about their sister, whom both loved. 

"They say," records Epiphanius, "that the soul is the food of the Archons and Powers without which they cannot live, because she is of the dew from above and gives them strength. When she has become imbued with knowledge ... she ascends to heaven and gives a defence before each Power and thus mounts beyond them to the upper Mother and Father of the All whence she came down into this world."&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''[[Panarion]]'', 40, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
"Some of them", continues Epiphanius, "pretend to fast after the manner of the monks, deceiving the simple, and boast of having renounced all property." [[Theodoret]] reports that it was the practice of some to pour oil and water on the [[Baptism for the dead|heads of the dead]], thereby rendering them invisible to the Archons and withdrawing them from their power. However, Epiphanius states that "they condemn baptism and reject the participation of the [[Sacred Mysteries|Holy Mysteries]] as something introduced by the tyrant Sabaoth, and teach other fables full of impiety."&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', 40, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
Their [[apocryphal]] books included: 
*The greater and lesser ''[[Symphonia]]''
*''The [[Ascension of Isaiah]]''
*''[[Allogenes]]''

'''Behavioral modernity'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ravi_Korisettar/publication/263296077_Early_Human_Behaviour_in_Global_Context/links/02e7e53a7f3375f168000000/Early-Human-Behaviour-in-Global-Context.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a suite of behavioral and cognitive traits that distinguishes current ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from other [[anatomically modern human]]s, [[Hominini|hominins]], and [[primate]]s. Although often debated, most scholars agree that modern human behavior can be characterized by abstract thinking, planning depth, [[symbol]]ic behavior (e.g., art, ornamentation, music), exploitation of large [[Game (hunting)|game]], and blade technology, among others.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McBrearty|first1=Sally|last2=Brooks|first2=Allison|date=2000|title=The revolution that wasn’t: a new interpretation of the origin of modern human behavior|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=39|pages=453–563|doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0435|pmid=11102266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henshilwood|first1=Christopher|last2=Marean|first2=Curtis|date=2003|title=The Origin of Modern Human Behavior: Critique of the Models and Their Test Implications|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=44|issue=5|pages=627–651|doi=10.1086/377665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically. Some of these human universal patterns are cumulative cultural adaptation, social norms, language, and extensive help and cooperation beyond close kin.&lt;ref name="Hill et al 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Kim|title=The Emergence of Human Uniqueness: Characters Underlying Behavioral Modernity|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|date=2009|volume=18|pages=187–200|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1002/evan.20224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, R. G. 1999. ''The human career: human biological and cultural origins.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the development of these modern behavioral traits, in combination with the climatic conditions of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], was largely responsible for the human replacement of [[Neanderthal]]s and the peopling of the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Errico 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Errico|first1=F|title=Neanderthal Acculturation in Western Europe?

Arising from differences in the archaeological record, a debate continues as to whether anatomically modern humans were behaviorally modern as well. There are many theories on the evolution of behavioral modernity. These generally fall into two camps: gradualist and cognitive approaches. The Later Upper Paleolithic Model refers to the idea that modern human behavior arose through cognitive, genetic changes abruptly around 40,000–50,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Klein 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klein |first=Richard |title=Anatomy, behavior, and modern human origins |journal=Journal of World Prehistory |date=1995 |volume=9 |pages=167–198 |doi=10.1007/bf02221838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other models focus on how modern human behavior may have arisen through gradual steps; the archaeological signatures of such behavior only appearing through demographic or subsistence-based changes.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marean et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marean|first1=Curtis|title=Early human use of marine resources and pigment in South Africa during the Middle Pleistocene|journal=Nature|date=2007|volume=449|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1038/nature06204|pages=905–908|pmid=17943129|bibcode=2007Natur.449..905M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell et al 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Adam|title=Late Pleistocene Demography and the Appearance of Modern Human Behavior|journal=Science|date=2009|volume=324|pages=1298–1301|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1126/science.1170165|bibcode=2009Sci...324.1298P|pmid=19498164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Premo Kuhn 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Premo|first1=Luke|last2=Kuhn|first2=Steve|title=Modeling Effects of Local Extinctions on Culture Change and Diversity in the Paleolithic|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2010|volume=5|issue=12|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0015582|pages=e15582|pmid=21179418|pmc=3003693|bibcode=2010PLoSO...515582P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

To classify what traits should be included in modern human behavior, it is necessary to define behaviors that are universal among living human groups. Some examples of these [[human universals]] are abstract thought, planning, trade, cooperative labor, body decoration, control and use of fire. Along with these traits, humans possess much reliance on social learning.&lt;ref name="Culture and the Evo Process"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyd|first1=Robert|last2=Richerson|first2=Peter|title=Culture and the Evolutionary Process|date=1988|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226069333|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakahashi 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakahashi|first1=Wataru|title=Evolution of improvement and cumulative culture|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=2013|volume=83|pages=30–38|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2012.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cumulative cultural change or cultural "ratchet" separates human culture from [[social learning in animals]]. As well, a reliance on social learning may be responsible in part for humans' rapid adaptation to many environments outside of [[Africa]].
Since cultural universals are found in all cultures including some of the most isolated indigenous groups, these traits must have evolved or have been invented in Africa prior to the exodus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade |first=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/15/science/early-voices-the-leap-to-language-510769.html?sec=health&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=leap to language |publisher=New York Times |date=2003-07-15 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Buller | first = David| title = Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature|page=468| publisher = PMIT Press| year = 2005| isbn = 0-262-02579-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/history/070618_morocco_beads.html |title=80,000-year-old Beads Shed Light on Early Culture |publisher=Livescience.com |date=2007-06-18 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/BF/bf02/klein/bf02e3.html |title=three distinct human populations |publisher=Accessexcellence.org |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologically, a number of empirical traits have been used as indicators of modern human behavior. While these are often debated&lt;ref name="Shea 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shea|first1=John|title=Homo sapiens Is as Homo sapiens Was|journal=Current Anthropology|date=2011|volume=52|issue=1|pages=1–35|doi=10.1086/658067}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few are generally agreed upon.

=== Critiques ===

Several critiques have been placed against the traditional concept of behavioral modernity, both methodologically and philosophically.&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shea 2011" /&gt; Shea (2011) outlines a variety of problems with this concept, arguing instead for "behavioral variability", which, according to the author, better describes the archaeological record. The use of trait lists, according to Shea (2011), runs the risk of taphonomic bias, where some sites may yield more artifacts than others despite similar populations; as well, trait lists can be ambiguous in how behaviors may be empirically recognized in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="Shea 2011" /&gt; Shea (2011) in particular cautions that population pressure, cultural change, or optimality models, like those in [[human behavioral ecology]], might better predict changes in tool types or subsistence strategies than a change from "archaic" to "modern" behavior.&lt;ref name="Shea 2011" /&gt; Some researchers argue that a greater emphasis should be placed on identifying only those artifacts which are unquestionably, or purely, symbolic as a metric for modern human behavior.&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt;

== Theories and models ==
{{Human timeline}}

===Late Upper Paleolithic Model or "Revolution"===

The Late Upper Paleolithic Model, or Upper Paleolithic Revolution, refers to the idea that, though [[anatomically modern humans]] first appear around 150,000 years ago, they were not cognitively or behaviorally "modern" until around 50,000 years ago, leading to their expansion into Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name="Klein 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffecker 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffecker|first1=John|title=The spread of modern humans in Europe|journal=PNAS|date=2009|volume=106|issue=38|pages=16040–16045|doi=10.1073/pnas.0903446106|pmid=19571003|pmc=2752585|bibcode=2009PNAS..10616040H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattersall 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tattersall|first1=Ian|title=Human origins: Out of Africa|journal=PNAS|date=2009|volume=106|issue=38|pages=16018–16021|doi=10.1073/pnas.0903207106|bibcode=2009PNAS..10616018T|pmc=2752574}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors note that traits used as a metric for behavioral modernity do not appear as a package until around 40–50,000 years ago. Klein (1995) specifically describes evidence of fishing, bone shaped as a tool, hearths, significant artifact diversity, and elaborate graves are all absent before this point.&lt;ref name="Klein 1995" /&gt; Although assemblages before 50,000 years ago show some diversity the only distinctly modern tool assemblages appear in Europe at 48,000.&lt;ref name="Hoffecker 2009" /&gt; According to these authors, art only becomes common beyond this switching point, signifying a change from archaic to modern humans.&lt;ref name="Klein 1995" /&gt; Most researchers argue that a neurological or genetic change, perhaps one enabling complex language, such as [[FOXP2]], caused this revolutionary change in our species.&lt;ref name="Klein 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattersall 2009" /&gt;

===Alternative models===
Contrasted with this view of a spontaneous leap in cognition among ancient humans, some authors like [[Alison S. Brooks]], primarily working in African archaeology, point to the gradual accumulation of "modern" behaviors, starting well before the 50,000 year benchmark of the Upper Paleolithic Revolution models.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foley Lahr 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foley|first1=Robert|last2=Lahr|first2=Marta|title=Mode 3 Technologies and the Evolution of Modern Humans|journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal|date=1997|volume=7|issue=1|pages=3–36|doi=10.1017/s0959774300001451}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howiesons Poort]], [[Blombos]], and other South African archaeological sites, for example, show evidence of marine resource acquisition, trade, and abstract ornamentation at least by 80,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marean et al 2007"/&gt; Given evidence from Africa and the Middle East, a variety of hypotheses have been put forth to describe an earlier, gradual transition from simple to more complex human behavior. Some authors have pushed back the appearance of fully modern behavior to around 80,000 years ago in order to incorporate the South African data.&lt;ref name="Foley Lahr 1997"/&gt;

Others focus on the slow accumulation of different technologies and behaviors across time. These researchers&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt; describe how anatomically modern humans could have been cognitively the same and what we define as behavioral modernity is just the result of thousands of years of cultural adaptation and learning. D'Errico and others have looked at [[Neanderthal]] culture rather than early human behavior for clues into behavioral modernity.&lt;ref name="D'Errico 1998" /&gt; Noting that Neanderthal assemblages often portray traits similar to those listed for modern human behavior, researchers stress that the foundations for behavioral modernity may in fact lie deeper in our hominin ancestors.&lt;ref name="D'Errico 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Errico|first1=Francesco|title=The Invisible Frontier A Multiple Species Model for the Origin of Behavioral Modernity|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|date=2003|volume=12|doi=10.1002/evan.10113|pages=188–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; If both modern humans and Neanderthals express abstract art and complex tools then "modern human behavior" cannot be a derived trait for our species. They argue that the original "human revolution" theory reflects a profound Eurocentric bias. Recent archaeological evidence, they argue, proves that humans evolving in Africa some 300,000 or even 400,000 years ago were already becoming cognitively and behaviourally "modern". These features include blade and microlithic technology, bone tools, increased geographic range, specialized hunting, the use of aquatic resources, long distance trade, systematic processing and use of pigment, and art and decoration. These items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the "human revolution" model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time. This suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviours in Africa, and its later export to other regions of the Old World.

Between these extremes is the view – currently supported by archaeologists Chris Henshilwood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henshilwood | first1 = C.

Red ochre, body painting, and language: interpreting the Blombos ochre. In R. Botha and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 62-92.&lt;/ref&gt; and others – that there was indeed some kind of 'human revolution' but that it occurred in Africa and spanned tens of thousands of years. The term "revolution" in this context would mean not a sudden mutation but a historical development along the lines of "the industrial revolution" or "the Neolithic revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Mellars, P. A., K. Boyle, O. Bar-Yosef and C. Stringer (eds), 2007. ''Rethinking the Human Revolution: new behavioural and biological perspectives on the origin and dispersal of modern humans.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it was a relatively accelerated process, too rapid for ordinary Darwinian "descent with modification" yet too gradual to be attributed to a single genetic or other sudden event. These archaeologists point in particular to the relatively explosive emergence of ochre crayons and shell necklaces apparently used for cosmetic purposes. These archaeologists see symbolic organisation of human social life as the key transition in modern human evolution. Recently discovered at sites such as Blombos Cave and Pinnacle Point, South Africa, pierced shells, pigments and other striking signs of personal ornamentation have been dated within a time-window of 70,000–160,000 years ago in the African Middle Stone Age, suggesting that the emergence of ''Homo sapiens'' coincided, after all, with the transition to modern cognition and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Henshilwood, C. S. and B. Dubreuil 2009. Reading the artifacts: gleaning language skills from the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa. In R. Botha and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp.  41-61.&lt;/ref&gt; While viewing the emergence of language as a 'revolutionary' development, this school of thought generally attributes it to cumulative social, cognitive and cultural evolutionary processes as opposed to a single genetic mutation.&lt;ref&gt;Botha, R. and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further view, taken by archaeologists such as Francesco D'Errico&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = D'Errico | first1 = F | year = 2003 | title = The invisible frontier: a multiple species model for the origin of behavioral modernity | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 188–202 | doi=10.1002/evan.10113}}&lt;/ref&gt; and João Zilhão,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zilhão | first1 = J | year = 2006 | title = Neandertals and moderns mixed, and it matters | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 183–195 | doi=10.1002/evan.20110}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a multi-species perspective arguing that evidence for symbolic culture in the form of utilised pigments and pierced shells are also found in Neanderthal sites, independently of any "modern" human influence.

Cultural evolutionary models may also shed light on why although evidence of behavioral modernity exists before 50,000 years ago it is not expressed consistently until that point. With small population sizes, human groups would have been affected by demographic and cultural evolutionary forces that may not have allowed for complex cultural traits.&lt;ref name="Powell et al 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premo Kuhn 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Culture and the Evo Process" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakahashi 2013" /&gt; According to some authors&lt;ref name="Powell et al 2009" /&gt; until population density became significantly high, [[complex traits]] could not have been maintained effectively. It is worth noting that some genetic evidence supports a dramatic increase in population size before human migration out of Africa.&lt;ref name="Tattersall 2009" /&gt; High local extinction rates within a population also can significantly decrease the amount of diversity in neutral cultural traits, regardless of cognitive ability.&lt;ref name="Premo Kuhn 2010" /&gt;

Highly speculatively, [[bicameral mind]] theory argues for an additional, and cultural rather than genetic, shift from selfless to self-perceiving forms of human cognition and behavior very late in human history, in the [[Bronze Age]].  This is based on a literary analysis of Bronze Age texts which claims to show the first appearances of the concept of [[self]] around this time, replacing the voices of [[gods]] as the primary form of recorded human cognition.  This non-mainstream theory is not widely accepted but does receive serious academic interest from time to time.

== Archaeological evidence ==

=== Africa ===
Before the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa theory]] was generally accepted, there was no consensus on where the human species evolved and, consequently, where modern human behavior arose. Now, however, African archaeology has become extremely important in discovering the origins of humanity. Since human expansion into Europe around 48,000 years ago is generally accepted as already "modern",&lt;ref name="Hoffecker 2009" /&gt; the question becomes whether behavioral modernity appeared in Africa well before 50,000 years ago, as a late Upper Paleolithic "revolution" which prompted migration out of Africa, or arose outside Africa and diffused back.

A variety of evidence of abstract imagery, widened subsistence strategies, and other "modern" behaviors have been discovered in Africa, especially South and North Africa. The [[Blombos Cave]] site in South Africa, for example, is famous for rectangular slabs of [[ochre]] engraved with [[geometric]] designs. Using multiple dating techniques, the site was confirmed to be around 77,000 years old.&lt;ref name="Henshilwood 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henshilwood|first1=Christopher|title=Emergence of Modern Human Behavior: Middle Stone Age Engravings from South Africa|journal=Science|date=2002|volume=295|issue=5558|pages=1278–1280|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1126/science.1067575|pmid=11786608|bibcode=2002Sci...295.1278H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beads and other personal ornamentation have been found from Morocco which might be as much as 130,000 years old; as well, the Cave of Hearths in South Africa has yielded a number of beads significantly before 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;

Expanding subsistence strategies beyond big-game hunting and the consequential diversity in tool types has been noted as signs of behavioral modernity. A number of South African sites have shown an early reliance on aquatic resources from fish to shellfish. [[Pinnacle Point]], in particular, shows exploitation of marine resources as early as 120,000 years ago, perhaps in response to more arid conditions inland.&lt;ref name="Marean et al 2007" /&gt; Establishing a reliance on predictable shellfish deposits, for example, could reduce mobility and facilitate complex social systems and symbolic behavior. Blombos Cave and Site 440 in Sudan both show evidence of fishing as well. Taphonomic change in fish skeletons from Blombos Cave have been interpreted as capture of live fish, clearly an intentional human behavior.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;

Humans in North Africa ([[Nazlet Sabaha]], [[Egypt]]) are known to have dabbled in [[chert]] [[mining]], as early as ~100,000 years ago, for the construction of [[stone tool]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.promine.com/blog/5-oldest-mines-in-the-world-a-casual-survey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Records2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guinness World Records|title=Guinness World Records 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f896CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|date=10 September 2015|publisher=Guinness World Records|isbn=978-1-910561-03-4|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
While traditionally described as evidence for the later Upper Paleolithic Model,&lt;ref name="Klein 1995" /&gt; European archaeology has shown that the issue is more complex. A variety of stone tool technologies are present at the time of human expansion into Europe and show evidence of modern behavior. Despite the problems of conflating specific tools with cultural groups, the [[Aurignacian]] tool complex, for example, is generally taken as a purely modern human signature.&lt;ref name="Joris Street 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joris|first1=Olaf|last2=Street|first2=Martin|title=At the end of the 14C time scaledthe Middle to Upper Paleolithic record of western Eurasia|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2008|volume=55|pages=782–802|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.04.002|pmid=18930513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anikovich 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anikovich|first1=M.|title=Early Upper Paleolithic in Eastern Europe and Implications for the Dispersal of Modern Humans|journal=Science|date=2007|volume=315|issue=5809|pages=223–226|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1126/science.1133376|pmid=17218523|bibcode=2007Sci...315..223A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of "transitional" complexes, like "proto-Aurignacian", have been taken as evidence of human groups progressing through "steps of innovation".&lt;ref name="Joris Street 2008"/&gt; If, as this might suggest, human groups were already migrating into eastern Europe around 40,000 years and only afterward show evidence of behavioral modernity, then either the cognitive change must have diffused back into Africa or was already present before migration.

In light of a growing body of evidence of Neanderthal culture and tool complexes some researchers have put forth a "multiple species model" for behavioral modernity.&lt;ref name="D'Errico 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Errico 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abadia 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abadia|first1=Oscar Moro|last2=Gonzalez Morales|first2=Manuel R.|title=REDEFINING NEANDERTHALS AND ART: AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE MULTIPLE SPECIES MODEL FOR THE ORIGIN OF BEHAVIOURAL MODERNITY|journal=Oxford Journal of Archaeology|date=2010|volume=29|issue=3|pages=229–243|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0092.2010.00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neanderthals were often cited as being an evolutionary dead-end, apish cousins who were less advanced than their human contemporaries. Personal ornaments were relegated as trinkets or poor imitations compared to the cave art produced by ''H. sapiens''. Despite this, European evidence has shown a variety of personal ornaments and artistic artifacts produced by Neanderthals; for example, the Neanderthal site of [[Grotte du Renne]] has produced grooved bear, wolf, and fox incisors, ochre and other symbolic artifacts.&lt;ref name="Abadia 2010" /&gt; Although burials are few and controversial, there has been circumstantial evidence of Neanderthal ritual burials.&lt;ref name="D'Errico 2003" /&gt; There are two options to describe this symbolic behavior among Neanderthals: they copied cultural traits from arriving modern humans or they had their own cultural traditions comparative with behavioral modernity. If they just copied cultural traditions, which is debated by several authors,&lt;ref name="D'Errico 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Errico 2003" /&gt; they still possessed the capacity for complex culture described by behavioral modernity. As discussed above, if Neanderthals also were "behaviorally modern" then it cannot be a species-specific derived trait.

=== Asia ===
Most debates surrounding behavioral modernity have been focused on Africa or Europe but an increasing amount of focus has been placed on East Asia. This region offers a unique opportunity to test hypotheses of multi-regionalism, replacement, and demographic effects.&lt;ref name="Norton Jin 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norton|first1=Christopher|last2=Jin|first2=Jennie|title=The Evolution of Modern Human Behavior in East Asia: Current Perspectives|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|date=2009|volume=18|pages=247–260|doi=10.1002/evan.20235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Europe, where initial migration occurred around 50,000 years ago, human remains have been dated in China to around 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Liu et al. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Wu|title=Human remains from Zhirendong, South China, and modern human emergence in East Asia|journal=PNAS|date=2010|volume=107|issue=45|pages=19201–19206|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1014386107|pmid=20974952|pmc=2984215|bibcode=2010PNAS..10719201L}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early evidence of human expansion calls into question behavioral modernity as an impetus for migration.

Stone tool technology is particularly of interest in East Asia. Following [[Homo erectus]] migrations out of Africa, [[Acheulean]] technology never seems to appear beyond present-day India and into China. Analogously, Mode 3, or [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] technology, is not apparent in China following later hominin dispersals.&lt;ref name="Norton Bae 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norton|first1=Christopher|last2=Bae|first2=K.|title=The Movius Line sensu lato (Norton et al. 2006) further assessed and defined|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2008|volume=55|pages=1148–1150|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of more advanced technology has been explained by serial founder effects and low population densities out of Africa.&lt;ref name="Lycett Norton 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lycett|first1=Stephen|last2=Norton|first2=Christopher|title=A demographic model for Palaeolithic technological evolution: The case of East Asia and the Movius Line|journal=Quaternary International|date=2010|volume=211|pages=55–65|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2008.12.001|bibcode=2010QuInt.211...55L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although tool complexes comparative to Europe are missing or fragmentary, other archaeological evidence shows behavioral modernity. For example, the peopling of the Japanese archipelago offers an opportunity to investigate the early use of watercraft. Although one site, Kanedori in Honshu, does suggest the use of watercraft as early as 84,000 years ago, there is no other evidence of hominins in Japan until 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Norton Jin 2009" /&gt;

The [[Zhoukoudian]] cave system near Beijing has been excavated since the 1930s and has yielded precious data on early human behavior in East Asia. Although disputed, there is evidence of possible human burials and interred remains in the cave dated to around 34-20,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Norton Jin 2009" /&gt; These remains have associated personal ornaments in the form of beads and worked shell, suggesting symbolic behavior. Along with possible burials, numerous other symbolic objects like punctured animal teeth and beads, some dyed in red [[ochre]], have all been found at Zhoukoudian.&lt;ref name="Norton Jin 2009" /&gt; Although fragmentary, the archaeological record of eastern Asia shows evidence of behavioral modernity before 50,000 years ago but, like the African record, it is not fully apparent until that time.

'''Buridan's Bridge''' (also known as '''[[Sophism]] 17''') is described by [[Jean Buridan]], one of the most famous and influential [[Philosophy|philosophers]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]], in his book ''Sophismata''. It is a [[self-referential]] [[paradox]] that involves a [[proposition]] pronounced about an event that might or might not happen in the future.

==The sophism==

The sophism is:
{{quotation|Imagine the following scenario:&lt;br&gt;
Socrates wants to cross a river and comes to a bridge guarded by Plato. The two speak as follows:&lt;br&gt;
''Plato:'' "Socrates, if in the first proposition which you utter, you speak the
truth, I will permit you to cross. But surely, if you speak falsely, I shall throw you into the water."&lt;br&gt;
''Socrates:'' "You will throw me into the water."&lt;ref name="Tense"/&gt;}}

[[Socrates]]' response puts [[Plato]] in a difficult situation. He could not throw Socrates into the water, because if he did he would violate his promise to let Socrates cross the bridge if he speaks the truth. On the other hand, if Plato allows Socrates to cross the bridge it would mean that Socrates spoke untruth when he replied: "You are going to throw me into the water." In that case Socrates should have been thrown into the water. In other words, Socrates could be allowed to cross the bridge if and only if he could not be.&lt;ref name="Buridan's Bridge"/&gt;

==Buridan's solution==

In order to solve the paradox Buridan proposes three questions:
#Is the proposition uttered by Socrates: "You are going to throw me into the water" true, or is it false?
#Is Plato's promise true or is it false?
#"What ought Plato to do to fulfill his promise?"&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In response to the first question Buridan states that it is impossible to determine if Socrates' proposition is true or false. This is because the proposition "You are going to throw me into the water" is a [[Problem of future contingents|future contingent]] that could be true or false depending on what Plato is going to do. Dr. Joseph W. Ulatowski says that Buridan apparently used [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] thesis about what "truth" is to come up with this response. Aristotle believed that a proposition is true if and only if it is verified by the state of things as they currently are. Contradicting the [[principle of bivalence]], Buridan implies a system of  [[three-valued logic]] in which there are three [[truth value]]s--''true'', ''false'', and some indeterminate third value.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In determining the truth value of Plato's conditional promise, Buridan suggests that Plato's promise was false, and that because Plato gave his promise carelessly he is not obligated to fulfill the promise.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In discussing the third question, "What ought Plato to do to fulfill his promise", Buridan states that Plato should not have given a conditional promise in the first place. He also suggests that Plato could have made sure that the condition was formulated in such a way that it would not cause a contradiction; because Plato cannot fulfill his conditional promise without violating it, he is not obligated to fulfill the promise. Ulatowski points out that this interpretation is the [[contrapositive]] of a principle of [[Immanuel Kant]]: "ought implies can".&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

==Philosophers on the sophism and its solution==

In his solution to the sophism, [[Walter Burley]] (d. 1344/1345) applied the principle "nothing is true unless at this instant" (''"nihil est verum nisi in hoc instanti"'') and concluded that "if a proposition is true it must be true now".&lt;ref name="truth now"/&gt;

Dr. Dale Jacquette of the [[University of Bern]] says that "Plato can either permit Socrates to pass or have him seized and thrown into the river without violating his conditional vow". Jacquette argues that Plato's conditional promise was given only in regard to Socrates's proposition being clearly and unconditionally either true or false. To prove his point Jacquette asks, what would Plato have to do if Socrates had said nothing and was "as silent as a [[Sphinx]]", or if he uttered something that could not be either proven or "undisproven", something like [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. Jacquette concludes that Plato's conditional promise was true, and Socrates's proposition is "neither true ''simpliciter'' nor false ''simpliciter''", and therefore Plato would be right regardless of the choice that he made.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In his book ''Paradoxes from A to Z'' Professor Michael Clark comes to the conclusion that if Plato is an honorable man, Socrates should not get wet under any circumstances. Clark argues that Socrates could say, "Either I am speaking falsely, and you will throw me in, or I am speaking truly, and you won't throw me in". Clark says that if this sentence is true, then it means that the first alternative "is ruled out", leaving us only with the second one. If this sentence is false, it means that both alternatives are false, and because Socrates spoke falsely "it will be false" to throw him into the river.&lt;ref name="Paradoxes from A to Z"/&gt;  

Dr. Joseph W. Ulatowski believes that since the truth value in Plato's conditional promise and even more so in Socrates's proposition is indeterminate, it means that Plato "ought to err on the side of caution with respect to the future contingency and allow Socrates to cross the bridge".&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt; In the same work Ulatowski offers a couple of humorous solutions to the paradox. Plato, Ulatowski says, could let Socrates to cross the bridge, and then throw him into water on the other side. Or both Plato and Socrates could combine their efforts and forcibly eject Buridan himself from Buridan's bridge.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

==In ''Don Quixote''==

Buridan's bridge sophism was used by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] in ''[[Don Quixote]]'',&lt;ref name="Paradoxes from A to Z"/&gt; when [[Sancho Panza|Sancho]] was presented with the Buridan's bridge dilemma: A man who was going to cross the bridge was asked to respond truthfully where he was going or otherwise to face a death by hanging. The man "swore and said that by the oath he took he was going to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing else."&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;

Sancho summarizes the situation by saying: "the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows; but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don't hang him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged". He then comes up with the solution, "that of this man they should let pass the part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with".&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt; After Sancho makes this statement, the person who was asking for advice reasons with him:{{quotation|"But then, senor governor," replied the querist, "the man will have to be divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die; and so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and it is absolutely necessary to comply with it."&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;}} Sancho comes up with the moral solution:{{quotation|...there is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living and passing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should let him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil.&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;}}

{{Buddhism}}
'''Chunseong''' ({{Korean|hangul=춘성|hanja=春城}}), born Lee Chang-nim (이창림, 李昌林; March 30, 1891 – August 22, 1977), was a Korean [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, scholar, poet, writer, and philosopher. His [[courtesy name]] was Muaedoin (무애도인, 無碍道人) or Chunseong (춘성, 春性).&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.aks.ac.kr/front/tabCon/ppl/pplView.aks?pplId=PPL_7KOR_A1891_1_0013960 춘성:한국역대인물종합정보] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724094733/http://people.aks.ac.kr/front/tabCon/ppl/pplView.aks?pplId=PPL_7KOR_A1891_1_0013960 |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Chunseong was born on March 30, 1891, in [[Inje]] county, [[Gangwon (historical province)|Gangwon Province]]. His father was Lee In-oh (이인오, 李仁五) and his mother was Lady Park of Milyang (밀양박씨). He was their fifth son. Chunseong's family line was of the [[Lee (Korean surname)|Pyeongchang Lee clan]] (평창이씨, 平昌李氏). His father was a tenant farmer. Although Chunseong's birth name was Lee Chang-nim (이창림, 李昌林), his [[Dharma name]] was Chunseong (춘성, 春城). He was often called Chunseong Chunseong (春城 春性).

== Early monk life ==
In his early years, Chunseong went to the [[Baekdamsa]] (백담사), a famous [[Buddhist temple]] in [[Inje]]. He begged to be a pupil, but [[Abbot (Buddhism)|abbess]] Manhae [[Han Yong-un]] (만해 한용운, 萬海 韓龍雲) rejected him because he was too young. Eventually, at age fifteen, he became a Buddhist monk, apprenticing under Manhae [[Han Yong-un]].&lt;ref name="seons"&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/religious/42103.html (20) 망월사 춘성선사] 한겨레 2005.06.14&lt;/ref&gt;

Chunseong was required to read through [[Hwaeom]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;gyeong (화엄경, 華嚴經) and Geumganggyeong (금강경, 金剛經). He studied them so well that he could recite the Hwaeomgyeong backwards. Because of this, he earned the nickname "Hwaeom monk" (화엄법사, 華嚴法師).

== March 1 movement ==
In November 1918, Chunseong's teacher published ''Yusim'' (translated as "whole mind"), a series of magazines that written to make Buddhism appeal to the youth. The following year, Yong-un was imprisoned for his involvement with the [[March 1 movement]]. Chunseong remained dutiful to his teacher while he was in prison and was the only head monk who regularly visited and sent over food and supplies. Even though his temple had plenty of firewood, Chunseong refused to use any heat during winter and slept in a freezing cold room:&lt;ref name="muaedo"&gt;[http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=20090309010323300080070 “걸출하고 막힘 없던 춘성스님, 신라때 태어났다면 딱 원효”] 문화일보 2009년 03월 09일자&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"My teacher is shivering in a cold cell in [[Seodaemun Prison]] because he was captured by the Japanese while fighting for independence. So how can I, his disciple, sleep in the comfort of a warm room?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Satire and humor ==

=== My hometown is my mother's vagina ===
Right after the [[Korean War]], it was illegal to cut down trees. Even though it was freezing cold weather, no one could gather firewood to heat themselves. So Chunseong decided to cut down some wood for firewood as well as to make repairs to the dilapidated temple.&lt;ref name="seons"/&gt; He got caught and was arrested the Japanese police for violating forestry laws. During his interrogation at the Uijeongbu Police Station, a detective asked Chunseong, "what is your address?" to which he replied, "my mother's vagina." The detective thought Chunseong was strange so he rephrased his question. "Where is your hometown?" Again, Chunseong replied saying, "my mother's vagina." Despite numerous attempts of asking these questions, Chunseong only responded with, "my mother's vagina."

This infuriated the detective so he told Chunseong to stop messing around and give a proper answer. So he asked, "Where is your legal domicile?" This time Chunseong responded with, "my father's penis." At this point, the police realized that they weren't able to get through to him so they sent him away, assuming he wasn't mentally sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-08-18|title=춘성 (1891년)|url=https://ko.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%EC%B6%98%EC%84%B1_(1891%EB%85%84)&amp;oldid=17127264|journal=위키백과, 우리 모두의 백과사전|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jesus' resurrection ===
One day, after visiting a temple, he was on his way back to [[Uijeongbu]] on a bus. On the ride, there was a Christian fanatic who was shouting into a loudspeaker, "Believe in Jesus Christ who died and resurrected! If you believe in Him, you will go to heaven!" This Christian saw that Chunseong was dressed in a monk's robe, and decided to stand in front of him and yell these words.

Chunseong decided to yell back, "What did you say? He died and rose again? The only thing that dies and rises again is my penis every morning!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=1999112416000101 &amp;#91;문화&amp;#93; 역마直星 들린 山사람 구수한 三材 얘기보따리] 문화일보 1999년 11월 24일자&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian felt awkward and got off on the next station to get away from the situation.

=== The commander of monks ===
Chunseong enjoyed his fair share of alcoholic drinks and often drank [[beer]] and [[makgeolli]] (which he referred to as [[Gokcha (drink)|gokcha]], or grain drinks).

One night, he had too much to drink and got caught violating curfew hours by a police officer. The police asked "Who are you?" &lt;ref name="muaedo" /&gt; Chunseong said, "I am a Jungdaejang (translated to "company commander")! The police officer went closer to him and upon seeing that he wasn't in the military, but was instead dressed in a monk's robe, he said, "Why would you lie saying that you were a company commander?" Chunseong replied, "I am the commander (daejang) of monks (jung), so am I not a Jungdaejang?"

The joke was a play on words because "Jung" means monk and "Daejang" means commander. Upon hearing this joke, the police officer let Chunseong get on his way because he thought he was a strange man.

=== Teaching a lesson to an old spinster ===
An elderly woman who regularly sought Chunseong to hear his lectures had a spinster for a granddaughter because her standards were too high. The elderly women sent her granddaughter to Chunseong so that he could teach her a lesson. The granddaughter showed up to meet him wearing a miniskirt. Upon seeing her, Chunseong said, "How can my big thing fit into your tiny thing?"

The granddaughter's face grew bright red as she ran out of the room crying out that he was a  "sham of a monk."

She returned to her home and was upset at her grandmother for sending her to see this monk. What he really meant was "How can his large teaching fit into your tiny mind" Upon hearing this, the spinster felt ashamed that she had jumped to a sexual conclusion.&lt;ref name="seons" /&gt;

== Practice ==
Throughout his life, Chunseong slept without a quilt or blanket. In the Korean language, the spelling of quilt is "Yibul" (이불).&lt;ref name="seons" /&gt; Because the word "Yibul" had another meaning, "to separate from Buddha," Chunseong refused to sleep with a blanket (이불, 離佛, to separate Buddha).&lt;ref name="seons" /&gt;

Chunseong did not believe in owning things.&lt;ref name="seons" /&gt; Even when his followers gave him clothes, he would give them to beggars and vagrants he encountered.&lt;ref name="seons" /&gt; Because of this, he had to hide his naked body until he could return to the temple at night. He also generously gave away all the money he received from his followers.

== Korean War ==
In the 1940s, he was told to cooperate with the law of [[Sōshi-kaimei]] (창씨개명, 創氏改名) and change his name to comply with the Japanese colonial authorities, but he refused.

In 1944, he went to the Doksungsan Sudeok Temple, where he studied under [[Mangong]] Song Wolmyon (만공 송월면, 萬空 宋月面).&lt;ref name="seons" /&gt; Mangong was top of the [[Korea]]n Ganhwaseon (看話禪, 간화선). He trained for [[Mangong]]. In 1946 he returned to Mangwol Temple (망월사, 望月寺) as its head. Chunseong was attacked for hypocrisy, rigorism, pretended philanthropy and formalism. In July 1949, he participated in funerals for Baikbum [[Kim Gu]] (백범김구 국민장, 白凡金九 國民葬)

In 1950, during the [[Korean War]], he escaped and returned to Mangwol Temple. At the end of the Korean War, he returned to his monks with bashfulness.

During the war, he preserved the Ganhwaseon tradition and the Mangwol Temple. In the 1950s, he became abbot of the Mangwol Temple, Shinheung Temple and the Bomun Temple.

== Last years ==
In the 1960s, the [[South Korea]]n regent was [[Park Chung-hee]]. In 1964, Chunseong was invited by him to [[Chungwadae]] (청와대, 靑瓦臺) since the First Lady, Yuk Young-su was a devout Buddhist. During his visit, Chunseong said, "the Lady Yuk was born from her mother's vagina," which caused many to panic.&lt;ref name="muaedo"/&gt;

In 1970, he again went to Mangwol temple. From 1970 to 1973 he practiced asceticism for Jangjabulwa (장좌불와, 長坐不臥), In 1973 he participated in public campaigns for safe driving and [[sobriety]].

== Death  ==
In 1977, he died in Mangwolsa, in Uijongbu. He was 86 years old.
   
At his funeral, he did not have a coffin. Instead, his corpse was covered with a straw mat. His funeral was short, with a short funeral march, during which the monks sang the song, "Grief of a drifter" (나그네 설움). His ashes are enshrined at the Bongkuk Temple, which is located in [[Seongnam]].

Long after his death, Chunseong's name was a social [[taboo]] for [[South Korea]] because of his controversial words and actions along with the social influence of [[Confucianism]]. That taboo eased in the 1990s, but in 2002, Doal [[Do-ol|Kim Yong-ok]] used one of his anecdotes for a program on [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]].&lt;ref name="yukdoo"&gt;[http://article.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.asp?total_id=1242919 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;여의도 스페셜&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 도올 TV강의서 육두문자 써 논란] 중앙일보 2002.10.08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0000090161 도올 TV 강의서 육두문자 인용 구설수 – 오마이뉴스] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320051504/http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0000090161 |date=2012-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[South Korea]]n broadcasting programs began to report more of his words and actions.&lt;ref name="yukdoo"/&gt;

:''For the concept in detective fiction, see [[closed circle of suspects]].''
{{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}}
A '''closed-circle''' argument is one that is [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]].

[[Psychoanalytic]] theory, for example, is held up by the proponents of [[Karl Popper]] as an example of an [[ideology]] rather than a [[science]]. A patient regarded by his psychoanalyst as "[[in denial]]" about his [[sexual orientation]] may be viewed as confirming he is [[homosexual]] simply by denying that he is; and if he has had sex with women, he may be accused of trying to buttress his denials. In other words, there is no way the patient could convincingly demonstrate his heterosexuality to his analyst. This is an example of what Popper called a "closed circle": The proposition that the patient is homosexual is not falsifiable.

Closed-circle theory is sometimes used to denote a [[relativism|relativist]], [[anti-realism|anti-realist]] philosophy of science, such that different groups may have different self-consistent truth claims about the natural world.

CrossBridge uses high-performance [[Computer memory|memory-access]] [[opcode]]s in the Flash Player (known as "Domain Memory") to work with in-memory data quickly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaming.adobe.com/technologies/flascc/ FlasCC for Flash Player], Adobe Gaming  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525005202/http://gaming.adobe.com/technologies/flascc/ |date=May 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CrossBridge uses the [[LLVM]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] as compiler backends, in order to compile C++ code, optimize it, and transform it to run within AVM2 (the ActionScript [[Virtual Machine]]). Programs built with CrossBridge are up to 10 times faster than normal ActionScript code,&lt;ref name="alc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alc2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alc3"/&gt; but up to 2× to 10× slower than native C++ code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/alchemy/ Alchemy], Adobe Labs&lt;/ref&gt;

CrossBridge can generate Flash Player movies ([[SWF|.swf]] files), or Flash Libraries ([[Adobe SWC file|.swc]] files), which can then be used by larger projects written in ActionScript 3 and compiled using the free [[Apache Flex]] SDK (formerly the Adobe Flex SDK). CrossBridge also uses the [[GPU]]-based 3D rendering acceleration present in Flash Player 11 (known as [[Stage3D]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaming.adobe.com/technologies/xc/ XC APIs], Adobe Gaming  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425014349/http://gaming.adobe.com/technologies/xc/ |date=April 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using CrossBridge, Adobe ported [[OpenGL]] for use within Flash Player Stage3D and released it as an open-source project in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/adobe/GLS3D OpenGL for Stage3D], GitHub project hosting&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lua (programming language)|Lua programming language]] (version 5.1) was also ported to run in Flash Player using CrossBridge, and released on Google Code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://code.google.com/p/lua-alchemy/ lua-alchemy], Port of the Lua programming language for ActionScript using Alchemy, Google Code&lt;/ref&gt; CrossBridge-compiled projects also enabled running client-side [[digital signal processing]] in real-time,&lt;ref&gt;[https://temptonik.com/en/news/Temptonik%20Manifesto,589824 Real-time pitch detection in AVM2], Temptonik, January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Fast Fourier Transform]] and [[Mexican hat wavelet|Mexican hat]] [[wavelet transform]].

==History==
In 2008, CrossBridge was released by Adobe as "Project Alchemy", on the [[Adobe Labs]] website. It enabled compilation of specially modified C++ projects to SWF, using the LLVM and GCC compilers.&lt;ref name="labsblog1"/&gt;

In 2012, in an attempt to monetize Flash Player, Adobe restricted use of the Stage3D and Domain Memory features of Flash Player under the "Premium Features" brand. The "Premium Features" were licensed for use and publishers were to pay royalties to Adobe for use of the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer/2012/07/premium-features-update.html Premium Features for Flash Player], Adobe Flash Team Blog, Adobe&lt;/ref&gt; Project Alchemy was commercially released as the Flash Runtime C++ Compiler.&lt;ref name="labsblog3"/&gt;

In 2013, Adobe open-sourced the Flash Runtime C++ Compiler as CrossBridge, and released it on the [[GitHub]] code hosting website.&lt;ref name="labsblog4"&gt;[http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer/2013/06/open-source-flash-c-compiler-crossbridge.html Open Source Flash C++ Compiler, CrossBridge], Adobe Blogs, June 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The "Premium Features" were also made free for use, and no longer required licensing or royalties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/premium-features.html Adobe Premium Features for Flash Player], Adobe Devnet&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Charles Gooding''' (21 November 1947 – 13 December 2009) was Professor of History and Philosophy of Science and Director of the Science Studies Centre, at the University of Bath, UK .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tweney | first = Ryan D. | title = Eloge: David Charles Gooding, 1947–2009 | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 101 | issue = 3 | pages = 609–609 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] via JSTOR | doi = 10.1086/657172 | date = September 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657172 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was President of the History of Science Section of the [[British Science Association|BAAS]] (2002–2003).

== Career ==
For over 30 years Gooding wrote and lectured on the role of visualisation, inference, communication, creativity and human agency in the sciences and was a specialist on the life and work of [[Michael Faraday]].  During 2002–2003 he held a [[Leverhulme Trust|Leverhulme]] Research Fellowship for research on Visualisation in the Sciences.  From 1991 to 1993 he held a Research Leave Fellowship from the MRC-ESRC-SERC (Joint Research Councils Initiative on HCI-Cognitive Science) for research on Simulating Natural Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = David C. Gooding (biography) |url=http://gooding.socialpsychology.org/|publisher=Social Psychology Network|date=16 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gooding's work is characterised by a multi-disciplinary approach, combining perspectives and methods from different fields including philosophy, history, sociology, art and cognitive psychology. Gooding's notion of Construal is of key importance to the field of Empirical Modelling within Computer Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gooding | first = David | title = Experiment and the making of meaning: human agency in scientific observation and experiment | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Dordrecht, Netherlands | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780792307198 }} [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/em/wj_re_em/construalgooding/ Excerpt: David Gooding's notion of construal, Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|divergent evolution in animals|Divergent Evolution in Animals}}
[[File:Darwin's finches.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Darwin's finches]] are a clear and famous example of divergent evolution, in which an ancestral species [[adaptive radiation|radiates]] into a number of descendant species with both similar and different traits.]]

'''Divergent evolution''' or '''divergent selection''' is the accumulation of differences between closely related species populations, leading to [[speciation]]. Divergent evolution is typically exhibited when two populations become separated by a geographic barrier (such as in [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]] or [[peripatric speciation]]) and experience different [[natural selection|selective pressures]] that drive adaptions to their new environment. After many generations and continual evolution, the populations become [[reproductive isolation|unable to interbreed]] with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/speciationmodes_05 |title=Sympatric speciation |publisher= |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American naturalist [[J. T. Gulick]] (1832-1923) was the first to use the term "divergent evolution",&lt;ref name="Gulick"&gt;{{closed access}} {{cite journal |last=Gulick |first=John T. |authorlink=J. T. Gulick |title= Divergent Evolution through Cumulative Segregation |journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology |date=September 1888 |volume= 20 |issue=120 |pages=189–274 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1888.tb01445.x |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNQUAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:HARVARD32044106309446&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= 26 September 2011}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its use becoming widespread in modern evolutionary literature. Classic examples of divergence in nature are the [[adaptive radiation]] of the [[Darwin's finches|finches]] of the [[Galapagos]] or the coloration differences in populations of a species that live in different habitats such as with [[Rock pocket mouse|pocket mice]] and [[Eastern fence lizard|fence lizards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Evolution |edition=2nd |author=Carl T. Bergstrom and Lee Alan Dugatkin |date=2016 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn=9780393937930 |pages=127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be applied in [[molecular evolution]], such as to [[protein]]s that derive from [[homology (biology)|homologous]] genes. Both orthologous genes (resulting from a speciation event) and paralogous genes (resulting from [[gene duplication]]) can illustrate divergent evolution. Through gene duplication, it is possible for divergent evolution to occur between two genes within a species. Similarities between species that have diverged are due to their common origin, so such similarities are homologies. In contrast, [[convergent evolution]] arises when an [[adaptation]] has arisen independently, creating [[analogous structures]] such as the wings of birds and of insects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18316">'''Eastern philosophy in clinical psychology''' refers to the influence of Eastern philosophies on the practice of [[clinical psychology]] based on the idea that East and West are false dichotomies. Travel and trade along the [[Silk Road]] brought ancient texts and mind practices deep into the West.  Vedic psychology dates back  5000 years and forms the core of mental health counselling in the [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic medical]] tradition. The knowledge that enlightened [[Siddhartha Gautama]] was the self-management of mental [[suffering]] through [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] awareness practices. Humane interpersonal care of the mentally disturbed was practiced in the Middle East in the Middle Ages, and later in the West.&lt;ref&gt;MIND (2004) [http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Factsheets/History+of+mental+health/Notes+on+the+History+of+Mental+Health+Care.htm Notes on the history of mental health care] ''Mind factsheets''&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the founders of clinical psychology were influenced by these ancient texts as translations began to reach Europe during the 19th century.

== Historical clinical psychologists ==
{{further|Islamic psychology}}

The historical practice of clinical psychology may be distinguished from the modern profession of clinical psychology. The Greek word ''psyche'' means 'breath' or 'soul', while ''-logy'' (from ''logos'', meaning 'speech') means 'study of'. [[Eros and Psyche|Psyche]] was the Greek goddess of the soul. An early use of the word [[clinic]] was to describe 'one who receives baptism on a sick bed' (Webster 1913).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.net/clinic.&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary use it usually describes another kind of cleansing and rebirth – a non-hospital, healthcare facility for rehabilitation in the community.

[[Patanjali]] was one of the founders of the yoga tradition, sometime between 200 and 400 BC (pre-dating Buddhist psychology) and a student of the [[Vedas]]. He developed the science of breath and mind and wrote his knowledge in the form of between 194 and 196 aphorisms called the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]. These remain one of the only scientific books written in poetic form. He is reputed to have used yoga therapeutically for anxiety, depression and mental disorders as common then as now.

[[File:Guru Rinpoche - Padmasambhava statue.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Padmasambhava|Padmasam-bhava]] developed Tibetan psychiatry]]
[[Padmasambhava]] was the 8th-century medicine Buddha of Tibet, called from the then Buddhist India to tame the Tibetans, and was instrumental in developing Tibetan psychiatric medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, T 'Tibetan buddhist medicine and psychiatry'  Samuel Wiser (1984) including charts of Tibetan psychopharmacology and translation of three chapters of the 8th Century text Gyu-Zhi&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetans were diplomats, counselors, traders, warriors and military tacticians in the Royal courts of East and West. Through these means they introduced arts of war and medicine to the west.

[[Rhazes]] was a Persian physician and scholar of the Middle Ages who had a profound effect on Western thought and medicine as well as the invention of alcohol and of sulfur drugs. He applied the psychology of self-esteem in clinical treatment of his patients (predating [[Nathaniel Branden]] by over a thousand years). He opened the first hospital ward for humane treatment of the mentally ill.

[[Avicenna]]'s ''Canon of Medicine'' was a standard medical text in many European universities for 500 years. He performed psychotherapy without conversing, by observing the movement of a patient's pulse as the patient recounted broken hearted anguish, reported in 'The Life and Work of Jalaluddin Rumi' by Afzal Iqbal, A. J. Arberry, page 94. His treatises have touched most of the Muslim circle of the sciences.

[[Jalaluddin Rumi]]'s view on psychotherapy was to embrace the dread, depression and anger as a blessing. Negative emotions were a bridge to a better life. This style of coping is illustrated in his guesthouse poem: 
::This being human is a guesthouse&lt;br&gt;every morning a new arrival a joy, a&lt;br&gt;depression, a meanness. Some momentary&lt;br&gt;awareness comes as an unexpected&lt;br&gt;visitor. Welcome and entertain them&lt;br&gt;all! Even if they're a crowd of sorrows&lt;br&gt;who violently sweep your house empty of&lt;br&gt;its furniture. Still treat each guest&lt;br&gt;honorably, He may be cleaning you out for&lt;br&gt;some new delight! The dark&lt;br&gt;thought, the shame, the malice meet them&lt;br&gt;at the door laughing and invite them in,&lt;br&gt;be grateful for whoever comes because&lt;br&gt;each has been sent as a guide from the&lt;br&gt;beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Rumi (1995) cited in Zokav (2001), p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] read the German translation of the works of [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital]] (1542–1620). Vital was a 16th-century rabbi who had been [[Isaac Luria]]'s student, the great master of the theosophical [[Kabbalah]].  Freud read the French translation of the [[Zohar]]. He declared the material 'gold!' without acknowledging that source in his theories. His corpus was deeply influenced by his Jewish heritage and by the Jewish mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;Drob (1989); and, Drob (1998-2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jungsm.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Carl Jung]] integrated psychology with spirituality]] 
[[Carl Jung]] read the German translations by [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] of ''[[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]'', the I Ching. He also read the Kabbalah and drew on its sources for development of his theory of the archetypes.&lt;ref&gt;Drob (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Buber]]

[[Karen Horney]] studied Zen-Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Fromm ''et al.'' (1960, p. 78) states that Karen Horney "was intensely interested in Zen Buddhism during the last years of her life." Also see DeMartino (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fritz Perls]] studied [[Zen Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Wulf (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Typifying such a perspective, Perls once stated: We must lose our minds and come to our senses.

[[Erich Fromm]] collaborated with [[D. T. Suzuki]] in a 1957 workshop on "Zen Buddhism and Psychoanalysis";&lt;ref&gt;Fromm ''et al.''. (1960) is based on presentations given during the 1957 workshop.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the foreword to a 1986 anthology of [[Nyanaponika Thera]]'s essays.&lt;ref&gt;See Nyanaponika ''et al'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erik H. Erikson]] wrote a biography of Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;Erikson (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Victorfrankl.JPG|thumb|right|100px|[[Viktor Frankl]] wrote of the "[[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]."|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 29 November 2007|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt; 
[[Viktor Frankl]] was the founder of Logotherapy. He wrote ''From Death Camp to Existentialism'' (1959) drawing on concentration camp experience and Jewish mysticism.

[[Abraham Maslow]], an American-born Jew who struggled to make his way as a psychologist in an academic atmosphere which was not then ready to receive Jews. He believed his theories of motivation and self-actualization were, despite his avowed atheism, driven by a Jewish consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art.man.ac.uk/RELTHEOL/JEWISH/Silverman.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The Transpersonal psychology that Maslow founded is a blend of Eastern and Western mystic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Nielsen (1994-2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanislav Grof]] studied pre-industrial cosmologies including Egyptian and explored the significance of the posthumous journey of the soul in works such as ''Books of the Dead'' and ''The Human Encounter with Death''.&lt;ref&gt;Grof (1994a); Grof (1994b); Grof &amp; Halifax (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential Western writers and translators ==
[[Baruch Spinoza]]'s legacy to psychology includes his holistic approach and determinism. He was alienated from his Jewish roots by [[Herem (censure)|excommunication]] and yet embedded in Jewish philosophy and mysticism, for example, 'The human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the body, but something of it remains, which is eternal. We feel and know by experience that we are eternal'. (Book V, Proposition 23).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070207080902/http://www.euronet.nl/~advaya/randomnotes.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished between active emotions (those that are rationally understood) and passive emotions (those that are not). This predated Freud's popularization of the [[unconscious mind]]. His view, that emotions must be detached from external cause in order to master them, presages [[rational emotive therapy]]. His understanding of the workings of mind makes a bridge between religious mysticism and clinical psychology.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was deeply influenced by the first  translations of Hindu and Buddhist texts to reach the west in the 19th Century. His philosophy and methods of inquiry have many similarities to those traditions. His ideas foreshadowed and laid the groundwork for Darwin's theory of evolution and Freud's concepts of libido and unconscious [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Psychology|mind]]. He added empiricism to self-examination, which presaged Freud's interpersonal application in [[psychoanalysis]].

[[File:CAFRD.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids|Caroline Rhys Davids]] wrote on [[Buddhism and psychology|Buddhist psychology]].]] 
[[Caroline Rhys Davids]] was a Pali scholar who translated original Pali texts in Buddhist Psychology. In 1914, she  wrote ''Buddhist Psychology: An Inquiry into the Analysis and Theory of Mind in Pali Literature''. Her teacher in Psychology was [[George Croom Robertson]], Scottish philosopher, editor of Mind from foundation in 1876 until 1891.

[[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] was a translator of Chinese into German of the I Ching, Tao Te Ching and The Secret of the Golden Flower, with a forward written by Jung, a close personal friend.

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|100px|[[Idries Shah]] expanded Western knowledge of [[Sufism]]]]
[[Idries Shah]] was an  author in the Naqshbandi sufist tradition who wrote works on psychology and spirituality. Defined Sufism in a way that predated Islam and did not depend on the Qur'an.

[[Coleman Barks]] has translated ecstatic poems of [[Rumi]] and other mystic poets of Persia.

[[Jack Kornfield]] trained as a Buddhist monk in India and Southeast Asia, holds a PhD in clinical psychology and co-founded the [[Insight Meditation Society]] and the Spirit Rock Meditation Center. His books include ''Seeking the Heart of Wisdom'' (1987, co-authored with [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]]), ''A Path with Heart'' (1993) and ''The Art of Forgiveness, Lovingkindness and Peace'' (2002).

[[Daniel Goleman]] taught psychology at Harvard, wrote on science for the New York Times and is the author of the best-selling ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1995) and ''Destructive Emotions: A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama'' (Bantam Books, 2003).

[[Thomas Cleary]] was a prolific translator of Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian and Muslim religious literature. First publication with his brother of the [[Blue Cliff Record]] in 1992.

== Contemporary clinicians ==
[[Marsha M. Linehan]] incorporates mindfulness techniques (particularly [[Zen]] practices) in her [[Dialectical Behavioral Therapy]] (DBT) which has been found to be particularly effective with Cluster-B personality disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding Linehan's conscious use of Zen techniques, see, for instance, Linehan (1993a), p. 19, and  Linehan (1993b), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] incorporates Buddhist [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] techniques in his [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR) program.&lt;ref&gt;Kabat-Zinn (1990), pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Epstein]] is the author of ''Thoughts Without a Thinker|Thoughts without a Thinker: Psychotherapy from a Buddhist Perspective'' (1995) and ''Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://domanassa.org/blog/sitting-with-depression/ Sitting with Depression]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mordechai Rotenberg]] has adopted the [[Kabbalistic]]-[[Hasidic]] [[tzimtzum]] paradigm, which he believes has significant implications for clinical therapy. According to this paradigm, God's "self-contraction" to vacate space for the world serves as a model for human behavior and interaction. The tzimtzum model promotes a unique community-centric approach which contrasts starkly with the language of Western psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpsychology.org/about2_e.php Rotenberg Center for Jewish Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques used in clinical settings ==

* [[Vipassana]] - trains one to perceive the momentary arising and dissipating of all phenomena, nurturing the calm, detached recognition of all things' impermanence and interdependence.

== Features ==

* Integrated security information management solution combining Linux (Fedora), 389 Directory Server, MIT Kerberos, NTP, DNS, Dogtag certificate system, SSSD and others.
* Built on top of well known Open Source components and standard protocols
* Strong focus on ease of management and automation of installation and configuration tasks.
* Full multi master replication for higher redundancy and scalability
* Extensible management interfaces (CLI, Web UI, XMLRPC and JSONRPC API) and Python SDK

{{As of | 2018}} FreeIPA uses [[389 Directory Server]] for its [[LDAP]] implementation, MIT's [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos 5]] for authentication and [[single sign-on]], the [[Apache HTTP Server]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] for the [[management framework]] and [[Web user interface|Web UI]], (optionally) [[DogTag]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
for the integrated [[Certificate authority|CA]], and [[BIND]] with a custom plugin for the integrated [[Domain Name System|DNS]] server. Since version 3.0.0, FreeIPA also uses [[Samba (software)|Samba]] to integrate with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Active directory|Active Directory]] by way of Cross Forest Trusts.

Each of the major components of FreeIPA operates as a pre-existing Free-Software/Open-Source project, the bundling of these components into a single manageable suite with a comprehensive management interface is GPLv3, but that does not change the licences of the components.

FreeIPA aims to provide support not just for Linux- and Unix-based computers, but ultimately also for [[Microsoft Windows]] and Apple [[OS X]] computers.

'''Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster''' (1869–1966) was a [[Germany|German]] academic, educationist, pacifist and philosopher, known for his public opposition to [[Nazism]].  His works primarily dealt with the development of ethics through education, [[sexology]], [[politics]] and [[international law]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Foerster was one of the sons of German astronomer [[Wilhelm Julius Foerster]], a director of the [[Berlin Observatory]] and a professor at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].  His two younger brothers became renowned is various areas in their own right; [[Karl Foerster]] as a landscape gardener and horticulturalist, and Dr. Ernst Foerster as a shipbuilder and the director of the shipbuilding division of the [[Hamburg-America-Line]].

===Time as a student and academic===
Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster studied philosophy, economics, ethics and sociology in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] and Berlin.  His doctoral thesis was completed in 1893 under the title ''Der Entwicklungsgang der Kantischen Ethik bis zur Kritik der reinen Vernunft'' (The development from [[Kantian ethics]] to critique of pure reason).  From 1898 until 1912 he lectured at the [[University of Zurich]] and other Swiss institutions, later lecturing at the [[University of Vienna]] and from 1914 at the [[University of Munich]].

===Opposition to German Militarism and persecution by the Nazis===
Foerster was strongly opposed to the German foreign policy in the era of the [[First World War]], particularly the militaristic attitudes of the ruling elite in Germany.  These views made him an exception to the prevailing nationalist tendencies in the German Empire, and due to this and his ethical views he was regularly attacked from nationalist circles.

His criticism of the political legacy of [[Otto von Bismarck]] during the war caused a great scandal at his university, and he was dismissed from his post for two semesters.  During this time, he returned to Switzerland, where he focused his efforts on the question of to what extent Germany was responsible for the First World War.  Foerster became convinced that Germany had blocked the success of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] in 1907, and had thereby isolated itself internationally and drawn a course for war.

When Foerster returned from Switzerland in 1917, he remained convinced that responsibility for the World War lay with the ruling elite in Germany, and particularly with the leaders of the military.&lt;ref&gt;''Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster (1869-1966) : Ein Inspirator der katholischen Friedensbewegung in Deutschland'' by Bruno Hipler, in ''Stimmen der Zeit'', 1990 edition 2, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  His views made him highly unpopular with the conservative factions of German society and he became seen as a key enemy by the newly created [[national socialist]] movement.

In 1920 he published his book, ''Mein Kampf gegen das militaristische und nationalistische Deutschland'' (My struggle against the militaristic and nationalistic Germany).  Following this, he received numerous death threats from right-wing radicals.  After [[Matthias Erzberger]] and later [[Walther Rathenau]] were murdered, Foerster was warned to seek refuge.  In 1922 he resigned from his teaching position and fled to Switzerland, later settling in France in 1926.  As Foerster continued from a distance to warn against growing German nationalism and the rise of national socialism, he became seen by the Nazis as a major intellectual enemy.  After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Foersters works were among those publicly burnt in [[Nazi book burnings|ritualised book burnings]] held across Germany.  At the book burning in Berlin on May 10, 1933, the prescribed "fire speech" consigned Foerster's writings to the flames with the words ''Gegen Gesinnungslumperei und politischen Verrat'' (Against immoral opportunism and political betrayal).  Foerster was on the first list of those whose German citizenship was to be revoked, signed on 23. August 1933 by the Reichminister for the interior.

Foerster was well-respected in France and received French citizenship.  However, after the occupation of France by the [[Wehrmacht]] in 1940, Foerster was immediately wanted by the [[Gestapo]].  Foerster, who had been living close to the Swiss border in case of this occurrence, fled to Switzerland.  The Swiss authorities however refused him asylum, even doubting the legitimacy of his French citizenship and explaining that they considered him to remain a German national.  He managed to then flee to Portugal and onwards to the United States.

===Post-war===
Shortly after the end of the [[Second World War]], Foerster wrote an article in the ''Neue Zürcher Zeitung'' in which he warned of a "Prussianisation" of the entire world, if the Germans didn't come to "recognition of their horrible guilt" for the crimes committed during the Nazi era and make amends by contributing to the rebuilding of "the noble values of humanity".  His memoirs appeared in 1953 under the title ''Erlebte Weltgeschichte, 1869-1953'' (Experienced World History, 1869-1953).

He lived until 1963 in [[New York City]], before returning to Switzerland to spend the last few years of his life in [[Kilchberg, Zurich|Kilchberg]] near [[Zurich]].

'''Fyodor Ippolitovich Shcherbatskoy''' or '''Stcherbatsky''' (Фёдор Ипполи́тович Щербатско́й) (30 August 1866 – 18 March 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author =  | title = Fyodor Ippolitovich Shcherbatskoy |  url = http://global.britannica.com/biography/Fyodor-Ippolitovich-Shcherbatskoy | website = Encyclopædia Britannica |  access-date = 31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), often referred to in the literature as '''F. Th. Stcherbatsky''', was a [[Russia]]n [[Indologist]] who, in large part, was responsible for laying the foundations in the Western world for the scholarly study of [[Buddhism]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. He was born in [[Kielce]], [[Poland]] ([[Russian Empire]]), and died at the Borovoye Resort&lt;ref&gt;The Borovoye / Borovoe / Burabay Resort area is located about 15 miles north-northeast of the railroad town [[Shuchinsk]] ( Shchūchīnsk ) ([[Burabay District]], [[Akmola Province]]) in the northern part of modern-day [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;/ref&gt; in northern [[Kazakhstan]].

Stcherbatsky studied in the famous [[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum]] (graduating in 1884), and later in the Historico-Philological Faculty of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]] (graduating in 1889), where [[Ivan Minayeff]] and [[Serge Oldenburg]] were his teachers. Subsequently, sent abroad, he studied Indian poetry with [[Georg Bühler]] in Vienna, and Buddhist philosophy with [[Hermann Jacobi]] in [[Bonn]]. In 1897, he and Oldenburg inaugurated ''Bibliotheca Buddhica'', a library of rare Buddhist texts.

Returning from a trip to [[India]] and [[Mongolia]], in 1903 Stcherbatsky published (in Russian) the first volume of ''Theory of Knowledge and Logic of the Doctrine of Later Buddhists''&lt;ref&gt;''Teoriia poznaniia i logika po ucheniiu pozdnieĭshikh' buddistov'' ( 2 vols., S.-Petersburg: Tip. "Gerol'd", 1903-1909 ) - Vol. I: ''Uchebnik logiki Darmakirti s tolkovaniem na nego Darmottary'' ( 1903 ) ( Note: Vol. 1 includes a translation of Dharmakirti's ''Nyāyabindu'' and Dharmottara's ''Nyāyabindutīkā''. ) - Vol. II: ''Uchenie o vospriĭ a tiĭ i umozakli u cheniĭ'' ( 1909 ).&lt;/ref&gt; ( 2 vols., St. Petersburg, 1903-1909 ). In 1928 he established the Institute of Buddhist Culture in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. His ''The Conception of Buddhist [[Nirvana]]'' (Leningrad, 1927), written in [[English-language|English]], caused a sensation in the West. He followed suit with his main work in English, ''Buddhist Logic'' (2 vols., 1930–32), which has exerted an immense influence on [[Buddhology]].

Although Stcherbatsky remained less well known in his own country, his extraordinary fluency in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan languages]] won him the admiration of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. According to [[Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya]],&lt;ref&gt;Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya ( Nov. 19, 1918 - May 8, 1993 ) - Indian Marxist philosopher. This quote appears to be from the "Introduction" Chattopadhyaya wrote to ''Papers of Th. Stcherbatsky'' (1969)(Calcutta: Indian Studies, Past &amp; Present - Soviet Indology Series, No.2).&lt;/ref&gt; "Stcherbatsky did help us – the Indians – to discover our own past and to restore the right perspective of our own philosophical heritage." The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (2004 edition) acclaimed Stcherbatsky as "the foremost Western authority on Buddhist philosophy".

[[File:Korea-Goheung Hyanggyo 5283-07 outer gate.JPG|thumb|Oesam, outer gate, of the Goheung Hyanggyo]]

The '''Goheung Hyanggyo''' was founded in 1441, during the reign of [[Joseon Dynasty]] King [[Sejong]]. In 1597 the school was heavily damaged during the [[Japanese Invasion of Korea (1592-1598)|Second Japanese Invasion]]. In 1695 it was moved to the present site and restored with the help of [[Confucian]] [[student]]s from Seongdong town.

The [[hyanggyo]] consists of two parts: first, the Myeongnyundang ([[lecture hall]]), which contains the Oesam outer gate and the east and west [[dormitory|dormitories]]. The second is the ritual area that includes the Naesam inner gate, Daeseongjeon ([[Confucian shrine]] hall), and the east and west Mu. This style of structure forms a Jeonhakhumyo, which means that lecture hall is placed in the front and the ritual hall in the rear. Jeonhakhumyo-type hyanggyos are situated on gently-sloping sites to emphasize the [[sacred]]ness of the Confucian shrine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocp.go.kr/jsp/vr/cybertour_text.jsp?codeid=130203010000&amp;eflag=E&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2018}} Sujik House, next to the Hyanggyo, houses Confucian students.

According to the current [[curator]], the Goheung Hyanggyo was the wealthiest of the Confucian schools during the period just prior to the occupation. During the second occupation, the funds of the Goheung Hyanggyo were [[confiscation|confiscated]] and used to build schools in the area. The [[Japanese occupation of Korea|occupying Japanese government]] took credit for building the schools, though the funds used to build the schools were actually those confiscated from the Goheung Hyanggyo.

[[Ritual]]s are held here every month at dawn; at those times, participants gather in the afternoons and evenings prior, staying overnight in the east dormitory and preparing for the next morning's [[ceremony]]. Many other additional activities occur at the Goheung Hyanggyo throughout the year.&lt;ref name="ghgyo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.transparent.com/korean/hyanggyo/|title=See Goheung Hyanggyo|accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">'''Gradient Salience model''' is a model of [[figurative language]] comprehension proposed by Rachel Giora in 2002. It was proposed as an alternative to the standard [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] model.

It offers a possible explanation for the results obtained in various contemporary studies, in which, in many instances, figurative language is processed as fast as literal language.

== Salient and non salient meanings ==

The definition of [[salience (language)|saliency]] is included in Rachel Giora's (2002) article "Literal vs. figurative language: Different or equal?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0378-2166(01)00045-5 |title=Literal vs. Figurative language: Different or equal? |year=2002 |last1=Giora |first1=Rachel |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Salient meanings''' are meanings which are stored in the mental [[lexicon]]. They are most prominent in language, as they are the most familiar, conventional, frequent and [[prototypical]].
'''Non salient meanings''', on the other hand, are meanings which are relatively new to language. They are novel and infrequent.&lt;ref name="lai"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2009.05.088 |title=Comprehending conventional and novel metaphors: An ERP study |year=2009 |last1=Lai |first1=Vicky Tzuyin |last2=Curran |first2=Tim |last3=Menn |first3=Lise |journal=Brain Research |volume=1284 |pages=145–55 |pmid=19505446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assumptions ==
Gradient Salience model assumes that the processing of [[metaphorical]] expressions depends on the meaning's saliency.&lt;ref name="lai"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Salient meanings are processed faster than non salient ones, as they are more familiar. That is why conventional metaphors and literal expressions are processed faster than novel metaphors.
*Non salient meanings are processed slower.

The '''''Hermetic Journal''''' was a quarterly journal dedicated to the Hermetic tradition, edited by [[Adam McLean]], and published by Megalithic Research Publications of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;''Remarkable alchemical periodicals of the 20th century.'' The Fire Lizard. 3 December 2011. https://thefirelizard.wordpress.com/tag/the-hermetic-journal/&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue was released in August 1978 and publication continued until 1992.&lt;ref&gt;The Alchemy Website http://www.alchemywebsite.com/journal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hermetic Journal'' explored [[alchemy]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] [[philosophy]] from various angles and attracted a wide range of contributors. It addressed a readership which had a deep interest in hermeticism, and was primarily available only through subscription. Back issues of the ''Hermetic Journal'' are still available bound in paperback editions (about 176 pages), each covering a year.&lt;ref&gt;The Alchemy Website http://www.alchemywebsite.com/journal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Hermetic Journal'' had a small circulation of about three to four hundred readers. It built up a network of people interested in furthering the investigation of alchemy and hermetic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;The Alchemy Website http://www.alchemywebsite.com/journal.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of only a few English periodicals which focused on alchemy and the Hermetic tradition in the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Lembert. ''The Heritage of Hermes: Alchemy in Contemporary British Literature.'' Galda &amp; Wilch, 2004. p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Other periodicals of the time were the academic journals [[Ambix]], and Cauda Pavonis, and publications by the Philosophers of Nature and the Paracelsus Research Society for members of their organizations. The ''Hermetic Journal'' distinguished itself by publishing over 1000 high quality articles. Often, these contained scholarly material from renowned authorities – such as [[Gareth Knight]], [[Stephen Skinner (author)|Stephen Skinner]], [[Ithell Colquhoun]], Kenneth Rayner Johnson, R.A. Gilbert, Graham Knight, Hans Nintzel, Joseph Ritman, and [[Joscelyn Godwin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Remarkable alchemical periodicals of the 20th century.'' The Fire Lizard. 3 December 2011. https://thefirelizard.wordpress.com/tag/the-hermetic-journal/&lt;/ref&gt; Uniquely, the ''Hermetic Journal'' was open to articles of a speculative nature but always tried to encourage scholarly research into hermetic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;The Alchemy Website http://www.alchemywebsite.com/journal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ian MacDougall Hacking''' (born February 18, 1936) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[philosopher]] specializing in the [[philosophy of science]]. Throughout his career, he has won numerous awards, such as the [[Killam prize|Killam Prize]] for the Humanities and the [[Balzan Prize]], and been a member of many prestigious groups, including the [[Order of Canada]], the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and the [[British Academy]].

== Life ==

Born in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, he earned undergraduate degrees from the [[University of British Columbia]] (1956) and the [[University of Cambridge]] (1958), where he was a student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Hacking also earned his [[Ph.D.|PhD]] at Cambridge (1962), under the direction of [[Casimir Lewy]], a former student of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianhacking.com|title=Ian Hacking, Philosopher|website=www.ianhacking.com|access-date=2016-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125172125/http://www.ianhacking.com/|archivedate=2013-01-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his teaching career as an instructor at [[Princeton University]] in 1960 but, after just one year, moved to the University of Virginia as an assistant professor. After working as a research fellow at Cambridge from 1962 to 1964, he taught at his alma mater, UBC, first as an assistant professor and later as an associate professor from 1964 to 1969. He became a lecturer at Cambridge in 1969 before shifting to [[Stanford University]] in 1974. After teaching for several years at Stanford, he spent a year at the [[Center for Interdisciplinary Research]] in [[Bielefeld]], Germany, from 1982 to 1983. Hacking was promoted to Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1983 and University Professor, the highest honour the University of Toronto bestows on faculty, in 1991.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From 2000 to 2006, he held the Chair of Philosophy and History of Scientific Concepts at the [[Collège de France]]. Hacking is the first Anglophone to be elected to a permanent chair in the Collège's history.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Miller, "Review of Ian Hacking, Historical Ontology", ''Theoria'' '''72'''(2) (2006), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; After retiring from the Collège de France, Hacking was a Professor of Philosophy at [[UC Santa Cruz]], from 2008 to 2010. He concluded his teaching career in 2011 as a visiting professor at the [[University of Cape Town]] and currently spends his days tending to his inner-city garden in Toronto with his wife, Judith Baker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Philosophical work&lt;!--'Transcendental nominalism', 'Dynamic nominalism', and 'Dialectical realism' redirect here--&gt;==

Influenced by debates involving [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[Imre Lakatos]], [[Paul Feyerabend]] and others, Hacking is known for bringing a historical approach to the philosophy of science. The fourth edition (2010) of Feyerabend's 1975 book ''[[Against Method]],'' and the 50th anniversary edition (2012) of Kuhn's ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' include an Introduction by Hacking. He is sometimes described as a member of the "[[Stanford School]]" in philosophy of science, a group that also included [[John Dupré]], [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] and [[Peter Galison]]. Hacking himself still identifies as a Cambridge [[analytic philosopher]]. Hacking has been a main proponent of a realism about science called "[[entity realism]]." This form of realism encourages a realistic stance towards answers to the scientific unknowns hypothesized by mature sciences, but skepticism towards scientific theories. Hacking has also been influential in directing attention to the experimental and even engineering practices of science, and their relative autonomy from theory. Because of this, Hacking moved philosophical thinking a step further than the initial historical, but heavily theory-focused, turn of Kuhn and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/ian-hacking/|title=Ian Hacking|last=Grandy|first=Karen|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1990, Hacking shifted his focus somewhat from the natural sciences to the human sciences, partly under the influence of the work of [[Michel Foucault]]. Foucault was an influence as early as 1975 when Hacking wrote ''Why Does Language Matter to Philosophy?'' and ''[[The Emergence of Probability]]''. In the latter book, Hacking proposed that the modern schism between subjective or personalistic probability, and the long-run frequency interpretation, emerged in the early modern era as an [[epistemological]] "break" involving two incompatible models of uncertainty and chance. As history, the idea of a sharp break has been criticized, but competing 'frequentist' and 'subjective' interpretations of probability still remain today. Foucault's approach to [[Episteme|knowledge systems]] and power is also reflected in Hacking's work on the historical mutability of psychiatric disorders and institutional roles for statistical reasoning in the 19th century. He labels his approach to the human sciences '''transcendental nominalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Transcendence (philosophy)]] and ''[[Nominalism]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A view that Hacking also ascribes to [[Thomas Kuhn]] (see D. Ginev, Robert S. Cohen (eds.), ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', Springer, 2012, pp. 313–315).&lt;/ref&gt; (also '''dynamic nominalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref name="Tekin"&gt;Ş. Tekin (2014), [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9332/1/Tekin%2C2012%2CMIT.pdf "The Missing Self in Hacking's Looping Effects"].&lt;/ref&gt; or '''dialectical realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;),&lt;ref name="Tekin"/&gt; a historicised form of nominalism that traces the mutual interactions over time between the phenomena of the human world and our conceptions and classifications of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/root-and-branch?page=full|title=Root and Branch|newspaper=The Nation|issn=0027-8378|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Rewriting the Soul: Multiple Personality and the Sciences of Memory]]'', by developing a historical [[ontology]] of [[multiple personality disorder]], Hacking provides a discussion of how people are constituted by the descriptions of acts available to them (see [[Acting under a description]]).

In ''[[Mad Travelers: Reflections on the Reality of Transient Mental Illnesses|Mad Travelers]]'' (1998) Hacking provided a historical account of the effects of a medical condition known as fugue in the late 1890s. Fugue, also known as "mad travel," is a diagnosable type of insanity in which European men would walk in a trance for hundreds of miles without knowledge of their identities.

== Awards and lectures ==

In 2002, Hacking was awarded the first [[Killam prize|Killam Prize]] for the Humanities, Canada's most distinguished award for outstanding career achievements. He was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]] in 2004. Hacking was appointed visiting professor at [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] for the Winters of 2008 and 2009. On August 25, 2009, Hacking was named winner of the [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]], a Norwegian award for scholarly work in the arts and humanities, social sciences, law and theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From autism to determinism, science to the soul |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/from-autism-to-determinism-sciencetothesoul/article1264432/ |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=August 26, 2009 |pages=1, 7 |author=Michael Valpy |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hacking was chosen for his work on how statistics and the theory of probability have shaped society.

In 2003, he gave [[The Sigmund H. Danziger, Jr. Memorial Lecture in the Humanities]], and in 2010 he gave the René Descartes Lectures at the Tilburg Center for Logic and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS).007. Hacking also gave the Howison lectures at the University of California, Berkeley, on the topic of mathematics and its sources in human behavior ('Proof, Truth, Hands and Mind') in 2010. In 2012, Hacking was awarded the [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art]], and in 2014 he was awarded the [[Balzan Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.balzan.org/en/prizewinners/ian-hacking|title=Ian Hacking - Balzan Prize Epistemology/Philosophy of Mind|website=www.balzan.org|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1499">"'''Introduction to Metaphysics'''" (French: "''Introduction à la Métaphysique''") is a 1903 essay about the concept of [[reality]] by [[Henri Bergson]].  For Bergson, reality occurs not in a series of discrete states but as a process similar to that described by [[process philosophy]] or the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]].  Reality is fluid and cannot be completely understood through [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduction]]istic analysis, which he said "implies that we go around an object", gaining knowledge from various perspectives which are relative.  Instead, reality can be grasped absolutely only through intuition, which Bergson expressed as "entering into" the object.

{{Jainism}}

==Main Points in Jainism==
* Every living being has a soul.
* Every soul is potentially divine and has the innate qualities of infinite knowledge, infinite perception, infinite power, and infinite bliss. Have benevolence for all living beings..
* Therefore, regard every living being as yourself and harm no one.
* Every soul is born as a celestial, human, sub-human or hellish being according to its own karmas.
* Every soul is the architect of its own life, here or hereafter.
* When a soul becomes freed from karmas, it gets God-consciousness (infinite knowledge,  infinite perception, infinite power, and infinite bliss) and becomes liberated.
* Right view, Right knowledge and Right Conduct (triple gems of Jainism) provide the way to this realisation.
* Non-violence (Ahimsa) is the basis of right faith, the condition of right knowledge and the kernel of right conduct.
* Control your senses.
*       Limit your possessions and lead a pure life of usefulness to yourself and others. Ownership of an object by itself is not possessiveness; however attachment to an object is possessiveness
* Enjoy the company of the holy and better qualified, be merciful to those who are afflicted and be tolerant towards those who are perversely inclined.
* Four things are difficult to attain by a soul: human birth, knowledge of the law, faith in it and the pursuit of the right path.
* It is important not to waste human life in evil ways.  Instead, we should strive to rise up on the ladder of spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Collected these points during my visit to South Indian Jain religious place at Ponnur Hill, Kund Kund Nagar, Thiruvannamalai District, Tamil Nadu, PIN 604505, India.  It is a logical explanation of the Jainism philosophy in summary form.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental Principles (Tattvas)==
{{Main|Tattva (Jainism)}}
Jain philosophy can be described in various ways, but the most acceptable tradition is to describe it in terms of the Tattvas or fundamentals.&lt;ref&gt;Uma Swami, [[Tattvartha Sutra]],100-200 BC&lt;/ref&gt;  Without knowing them one cannot progress towards liberation. They are:

# [[Jīva (Jainism)|Jīva]] - Souls and living things
# [[Ajiva]] - Non-living things
# [[Asrava]] - Influx of karma
# [[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]] - The bondage of karma
# [[Samvara]] - The stoppage of influx of karma
# [[Nirjara]] - Shedding of karma
# [[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]] - Liberation or Salvation

Each one of these fundamental principles are discussed and explained by Jain Scholars in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Mehta, T.U. ''Path of Arhat - A Religious Democracy'', Volume 63 Page 112, Faridabad: Pujya Sohanalala Smaraka Parsvanatha Sodhapitha, 1993.
&lt;/ref&gt; There are two examples that can be used to explain the above principle intuitively.

(1) A man rides a wooden boat to reach the other side of the river. Now the man is Jiva, the boat is ajiva. Now the boat has a leak and water flows in. That incoming of water is Asrava and accumulating there is Bandh, Now the man tries to save the boat by blocking the hole. That blockage is ''Samvara'' and throwing the water outside is Nirjara. Now the man crosses the river and reaches his destination, Moksha.

== Nine substance==
Nine substances are explained as:
Consider a family living in a house. One day, they were enjoying a fresh cool breeze coming through their open doors and windows of the house. However, the weather suddenly changed to a terrible dust storm. The family, realizing the storm, closed the doors and windows. But, by the time they could close all the doors and windows some of the dust had been blown into the house.  After closing the doors and the windows, they started clearing the dust that had come in to make the house clean again.

This simple scenario can be interpreted as follows:

1) Jivas are represented by the living people.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Ajiva is represented by the house.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Punya is represented by enjoyment resulting from the nice cool
breeze.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Pap is represented by discomfort resulting from the storm.&lt;br /&gt;
5) Asrava is represented by the influx of dust.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Bandh is represented by the accumulation of dust in the house.&lt;br /&gt;
7) Samvara is represented by the closing of the doors and windows to stop the accumulation of dust.&lt;br /&gt;
8) Nirjara is represented by the cleaning up of already collected dust from the house.&lt;br /&gt;
9) Moksha is represented by the cleaned house, which is similar to the shedding off all karmic particles from the soul.

==Jīvas (souls)==
[[File:Jiva.jpg|thumb|Classification of ''Saṃsāri Jīvas'' (Transmigrating Souls) in Jainism.According to Sacred Jain text, ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'': "Immobile beings (''sthāvara jīvās'') possess the four vitalities of the sense-organ of touch, strength of body or energy, respiration and life-duration.{{sfn|Jain|1960|p=62-63}}]]

There are five classes of beings:

One-sensed beings (Ekendriya Jiva) have:
* Sense of touch

Two-sensed beings (Beindriya Jiva) have:
* Sense of touch
* Sense of taste

Three-sensed beings (Trindriya Jiva) have:
* Sense of touch
* Sense of taste
* Sense of smell

Four-sensed beings (Caturendriya Jiva) have:
* Sense of touch
* Sense of taste
* Sense of smell
* Sense of sight

Five-sensed beings (Pañcendriya Jiva) have:
* Sense of touch
* Sense of taste
* Sense of smell
* Sense of sight
* Sense of hearing

There are two sub-categories among the five-sensed beings:
Sanjñi - With mind;
Asanjñi - Without mind

==Vitalities==
A ''prana'' (vitalities)  is the inherent ability of a jiva to perform a certain act. The 10 pranas are as under:

# Shrotrendriya Prana - Ability to hear
# Caksurendriya Prana - Ability to see
# Ghranendriya Prana - Ability to smell
# Rasanendriya Prana - Ability to taste
# Sparshanendriya Prana - Ability to touch
# Manabala Prana - Ability to think
# Vacanabala Prana - Ability to speak
# Kayabala Prana - Physical ability
# Shvasocchvasabala Prana - Ability to breathe
# Ayushyabala Prana - Ability to live.

(It is said that any living being lives only as long as his/her Ayushyabala Prana permits him/her to.)

==Types of Kaya (Bodies)==
* '''Prthvikaya Jiva''' - Class of beings whose body is made up of the Earth. They fall under the category of One-sensed beings.
* '''JalaKaya Jiva''' - Class of beings whose body is made up of water. They fall under the category of One-sensed beings.
* '''Agnikaya Jiva''' - Class of beings whose body is made up of fire. They fall under the category of One-sensed beings.
* '''Vayukaya Jiva''' - Class of beings whose body is made up of air. They fall under the category of One-sensed beings.
* '''Vanaspatikaya Jiva''' - Class of beings whose body is made up of vegetation. They fall under the category of One-sensed beings.
* '''Trasakaya Jiva''' - Class of beings who are mobile. They fall under the category of two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed beings.

==Indriyas==
The Five Indriyas, or 5 senses are:

# '''Sparshana Indriya''' - Sense of touch
# '''Rasana Indriya''' - Sense of taste
# '''Ghrana Indriya''' - Sense of smelling
# '''Chakshu Indriya''' - Sense of seeing
# '''Karna or Shrotra Indriya''' - Sense of hearing

==Paryaptis==
Paryaptis or sufficiencies, which are determined by the presence of karmin particles in each soul at the time the soul is taking a new birth. Paryaptis are of 6 types:

# Ahara Paryapti - The presence of karmic particles that determine the ability of a jiva to eat
# Sharira Paryapti - The presence of karmic particles that determine the ability of a jiva to have a body.
# Indriya Paryapti - The presence of karmic particles that determine the ability of a jiva to have the organs of sense, namely, touch, taste, smell, hearing and vision.
# Shvasocchvasa Paryapti - The presence of karmic particles that enable a jiva to breathe.
# Bhasha Paryapti - The presence of karmic particles that enable a jiva to speak.
# Mana Paryapti - The presence of karmic particles that enable a jiva to think rationally and distinguish between the heya (avoidable), jneya (knowable but not doable) and upadeya (worthy of emulation).

==Types of physique==
Worldly souls (souls that have not attained liberation) are accompanied by 5 types of physique:

# Audarika Sharira - The physical body, made up of skin, bones, meat, blood, etc. All the living beings who lived on Earth have this body.
# Vaikriyaka Sharira - The body of heavenly beings and hellish beings. Not subject to the physical laws of the Earth. It is believed that this kind of physique can morph into various forms.
# Aharaka Sharira - This is a special kind of physique and can only be formed by very special ascetics who are extremely learned in the Ancient texts (the Purvas).
# Taijas Sharira - This kind of physique is had by each living being, since it is essential in order to absorb the food we eat, the liquids we drink and the air we breathe. It is likened to fire, since fire can consume all before it.
# Karmana Sharira - This kind of physique is had by each living being which is not liberated, whether the being lives in hell, heaven or Earth. This physique is made of karmas.

==Yogas==
The fifteen Yogas (sum total of activities) are made up of four Manoyogas (mental activities), four Vacanayogas (verbal activities), and seven Kayayogas (physical activities).

The four Manoyogas are:
* Satya Manoyoga - Truthful Mental Activity,
* Asatya Manoyoga - False Mental Activity,
* Mishra Manoyoga - Mental Activity that is partly true and partly false,
* Vyavahara Manoyoga - Practical Mental Activity.

The four Vacanayogas are:
* Satya Vacanayoga - Truthful Verbal Activity,
* Asatya Vacanayoga - False Verbal Activity,
* Mishra Vacanayoga - Verbal Activity that is partly true and partly false,
* Vyavahara Vacanayoga - Practical Verbal Activity.

The 7 Kayayogas are:
* Audarika Kayayoga,
* Audarika Mishra Kayayoga,
* Vaikriyaka Kayayoga,
* Vaikriyaka Mishra Kayayoga,
* Aharaka Kayayoga,
* Aharaka Mishra Kayayoga,
* Karmana Kayayoga.

==Karma theory==
{{main|Karma in Jainism}}
The Jain religion places great emphasis on [[Karma]]. Essentially, it means that all [[jiva]]s reap what they sow. A happy or miserable existence is influenced by actions in previous births. These results may not occur in the same life, and what we sow is not limited to physical actions. Physical, verbal, and mental activities affect future situations. [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]] has long been an essential component of Jainism, and other Indian religions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Sikhism]]. It is believed generally that an omniscient Tirthankar can foresee all things, long before science.

==Types of Karmas==
* '''Four Ghātiyā karmas'''

# {{IAST|Ghātiyā karmas are those karmas that obstruct the soul's innate abilities of omniscience, omni-perception, supreme bliss and omnipotence.}}
# {{IAST|'''Jñānāvaraṇīya karma''' - Karmas that obstruct the soul's intrinsic ability to know everything (omniscience)}}
# {{IAST|'''Darśanāvaraṇīya karma''' - Karmas that obstruct the soul's intrinsic ability to see everything (omni-perception)}}
# {{IAST|'''Mohanīya karma''' - Deluding karmas that obstruct the soul's intrinsic ability to be supremely blissful. }}
# {{IAST|'''Antarāya karma''' - Obstruction-causing karmas that obstruct the soul's intrinsic supreme strength (omnipotence)}}
* '''Four Aghātiyā karmas'''

# {{IAST|Aghātiyā karmas are those karmas that cause temporal bondage.}}
# {{IAST|'''Vedanīya karma''' - Karmas that cause feelings of happiness and unhappiness.}}
# {{IAST|'''Nāma karma''' - Karmas that determine the type of body the soul will take birth in.}}
# {{IAST|'''Āyu karma''' - Karmas that determine life span of the body the soul will take birth in.}}
# {{IAST|'''Gotra karma''' - Karmas that determine whether one is born in a high status family or a low status family.}}

==Components of Samyaktva==
* '''{{IAST|Niḥśankitatva}}''' - Having no doubts as to the veracity and correctness of the Jina's teachings.
* '''{{IAST|Niḥkānkṣitatva}}''' - Having no temporal desire in the pursuit of spiritual goals.
* '''Nirvicikitsatva''' - Having no repugnance or embarrassment in serving Jain ascetics despite the fact that male Digambara Jain ascetics wear no clothes and that no Jain ascetics of any sect bathe, brush their teeth or perform other activities that involve beautifying the body.
* '''{{IAST|Amūḍhadṛṣṭitva}}''' - Absence of false understanding of the Jina's teachings.
* '''{{IAST|Upabṛṃhana}}''' - Acquiring excellence in spiritual activities and observance of religious practices.
* '''{{IAST|Shtitikaraṇa}}''' - Stabilizing the faith of fellow Jains who seem to be shaky in their faith in the teachings of the Jinas, to restore their faith in the Jinas.
* '''Prabhāvanā''' - Conducting one's life in a manner that glorifies the Jain religion.
* '''Vātsalya''' - Brotherhood and fraternity with fellow Jains.

==Bhāvanā (Mental Contemplations)==
* '''Anitya''' - Impermanence. Everything is impermanent except the soul.
* '''&lt;nowiki&gt;Aśaraṇa&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - No lasting shelter in this constantly changing world except Moksha, or liberation.
* '''Saṃsāra''' - The temporal world is impermanent. Only Moksha is permanent.
* '''Ekatva''' - Oneness with the soul
* '''Anyatva''' - Otherness with all persons and things other than the soul
* '''Aśucitva''' - The body is full of filth. Hence, identification with and attachment for this mortal body is futile.
* '''Āsrava''' - Influx. Deluded worldly beings suffer from the constant influx of bondage-causing karmas to the soul.
* '''Samvara''' - Stoppage. The stoppage of the influx of bondage-causing karmas to the soul.
* '''Nirjarā''' - Shedding. The shedding of bondage-causing karmas from the soul.
* '''Dharmasvākhyāta''' - Dharma is self-realizable.
* '''Loka''' - The Universe in all its forms
* '''Bodhidurlabha''' - It is difficult, well nigh impossible to attain correct understanding of the soul and the true path to liberation.

==Sinful activities==
Jains observe the vow of [[Ahimsa]] and refrain from all violence. It is recommend that sinful activities should be eradicated. Some sinful activities are as under:

'''Joseph Raz''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ɑː|z}}; {{lang-he|יוסף רז}}; born 21 March 1939) is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[legal philosophy|legal]], [[moral philosophy|moral]] and [[political philosophy|political]] [[philosopher]]. He is one of the most prominent advocates of [[legal positivism]] and is well known for his conception of [[perfectionist liberalism]]. Raz spent most of his career as a [[professor]] of [[philosophy of law]] at the University of Oxford associated with [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], and is now a part-time professor of law at [[Columbia University Law School]] and a part-time professor at [[King's College London]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://josephnraz.googlepages.com/home|title=josephnraz|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received the prestigious [[Tang Prize]] for rule of law in 2018.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Mandate Palestine]] in 1939, Joseph Raz graduated in 1963 from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] with a [[Magister Juris]] (''[[summa cum laude]]''). Later, with funds provided by the Hebrew University, Raz pursued a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] at the [[University of Oxford]] under the supervision of [[H. L. A. Hart]]. Raz had met Hart earlier at a conference in Israel, impressing him by pointing out a flaw in his reasoning that had previously eluded him; Hart encouraged him to go to Oxford for further study. Raz studied at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] and completed his [[DPhil]] in 1967.

He then returned to Israel to teach at the Hebrew University as a lecturer in the Faculty of Law and Department of Philosophy. In 1971, he was tenured and promoted to Senior Lecturer. In 1972, he returned to Balliol as a Fellow and Tutor in Law, becoming a Professor of Philosophy of Law, Oxford University, from 1985 to 2006, and then a Research Professor from 2006 to 2009. Since 2002 he has also been a Professor in the Law School at Columbia University. Raz, now retired from Oxford, is currently also a visiting professor of law at [[King's College London]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Philosophical work==
A pupil of [[H. L. A. Hart]], Raz has been important in continuing the development of legal positivism both before and since Hart's death. Raz was also co-editor of a second edition of Hart's ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' with a postscript including Hart's responses to other philosophers' criticisms of his work.

Raz's first book, ''The Concept of a Legal System'', was based on his doctoral thesis.  A later book, ''The Morality of Freedom'' won two prizes: the 1987 W.J.M. Mackenzie Book Prize from the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom, awarded to the best book in political science each calendar year; and the 1988 Elaine and David Spitz Book Prize from the Conference for the Study of Political Thought, New York, awarded annually for the best book in liberal and/or democratic theory that had been published two years earlier. The book develops a conception of [[perfectionist liberalism]].

Raz has argued for a distinctive understanding of legal commands as exclusionary reasons for action and for the "service conception" of authority, according to which those subject to an authority "can benefit by its decisions only if they can establish their existence and content in ways which do not depend on raising the very same issues which the authority is there to settle."&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/legal-obligation/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Leslie|last=Green|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=3 February 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, supports Raz's argument for legal positivism, in particular "the sources thesis," "the idea that an adequate test for the existence and content of law must be based only on social facts, and not on moral arguments.".&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt;

Raz is acknowledged by his contemporaries as being one of the most important living legal philosophers. He has authored and edited eleven books to date, namely ''The Concept of a Legal System'' (1970), ''Practical Reason and Norms'' (1975), ''The Authority of Law'' (1979), ''The Morality of Freedom'' (1986), ''Authority'' (1990), ''Ethics in the Public Domain'' (1994), ''Engaging Reason'' (1999), ''Value, Respect and Attachment'' (2001), ''The Practice of Value'' (2003), ''Between Authority and Interpretation'' (2009), and ''From Normativity to Responsibility'' (2011). His most recent work deals less with legal theory and more with political philosophy and practical reasoning. In moral theory, Raz defends [[value pluralism]] and the idea that various values are [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurable]].

Raz's work has been cited by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in such cases as ''[[Imperial Tobacco v. British Columbia]]'' and ''[[Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)]]''.

Several of Raz's students have become important legal and moral philosophers, including the three current Professors in Jurisprudence at Oxford, [[John Gardner (legal philosopher)|John Gardner]], [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]], and [[Timothy Endicott]].

==Honors and awards==

Raz was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1987&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britac.ac.uk/users/professor-joseph-raz&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/josephnraz/cv|title=cv - josephnraz|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been awarded Honorary Doctorates by the [[Catholic University of Brussels]], 1993, and by [[King's College London]], 2009. In 2005 he received the International Prize for Legal Research 'Hector Fix-Zamudio' from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], and in 2009 a Vice-Presidency Award from the Law Society of [[University College Dublin]]. In 2018 he received the [[Tang Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tang-prize.org/en/owner.php?cat=13 Tang Prize 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000–2001, he gave the [[Tanner Lectures on Human Values]] on "The Practice of Value" at the [[University of California Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grad.berkeley.edu/tanner/past.shtml |title=Past Lectures |publisher=The Tanner Lectures on Human Values at University of California Berkeley |accessdate=5 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407093910/https://grad.berkeley.edu/tanner/past.shtml |archivedate= 7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Daub''' (20 March 1765{{snd}}22 November 1836) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Protestant]] [[theology|theologian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of German theology in the nineteenth century|author=Lichtenberger, F., trans. &amp; edited by W. Hastie|year=1889|location=Edinburgh|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|chapter=CARL DAUB|pages=222–227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qd9JAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born at [[Kassel]].  He studied [[philosophy]], [[philology]] and [[theology]] at [[university of Marburg|Marburg]] in 1786, and eventually (1795) became professor ordinarius of theology at the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he remained until his death. He became rector of the university in 1816 and 1824.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s197410804.online.de/Personen/Daub.htm Heidelberger Geschichtsverein - Karl Daub.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was married in 1801 to Sophie Wilhelmine Charlotte Blum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=ZtlfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA48 Ergänzende Biographieen, und vollständiges Register über alle 18 Bände], p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daub was one of the leaders of a school which sought to reconcile theology and philosophy, and to bring about a speculative reconstruction of orthodox [[dogma]]. In the course of his intellectual development, he came successively under the influence of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich von Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], and on account of the different phases through which he passed he was called the [[Talleyrand]] of German thought. There was one great defect in his speculative theology: he ignored historical criticism. His purpose was, as [[Otto Pfleiderer]] says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"to connect the metaphysical ideas, which had been arrived at by means of philosophical dialectic, directly with the persons and events of the Gospel narratives, thus raising these above the region of ordinary experience into that of the supernatural, and regarding the most absurd assertions as philosophically justified. Daub had become so hopelessly addicted to this perverse principle that he deduced not only Jesus as the embodiment of the philosophical idea of the union of God and man, but also Judas Iscariot as the embodiment of the idea of a rival god, or Satan."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The three stages in Daub's development are clearly marked in his writings. His ''Lehrbuch der Katechetik'' (1801) was written under the spell of Kant. His ''Theologumena'' (1806), his ''Einleitung in das Studium der christlichen Dogmatik'' (1810), and his ''Judas Ischarioth'' (2 vols., 1816, 2nd ed., 1818), were all written in the spirit of Schelling, the last of them reflecting a change in Schelling himself from theosophy to positive philosophy. Daub's ''Die dogmatische Theologie jetziger Zeit oder die Selbstsucht in der Wissenschaft des Glaubens'' (1833), and ''Vorlesungen über die Prolegomena zur Dogmatik'' (1839), are Hegelian in principle and obscure in language.

He died in [[Heidelberg]].

==Legacy==
[[Søren Kierkegaard]] is notable among those who were prominently influenced by Daub's thought. In ''From the Papers of One Still Living'', Kierkegaard wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There must come a moment, I say, when as Daub observes, life is understood backward through the idea…
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some years later, Kierkegaard expanded on this idea in his journal, in a passage that is often quoted or paraphrased:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Philosophy is perfectly right in saying that life must be understood backwards. But then one forgets the other claim – that it must be lived forwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stewart |first1=Jon |title=Kierkegaard and His German Contemporaries: Theology |date=2007 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=0754661326 |pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''knowledge regime''' is a type of system involving a specific set of actors, organizations, and institutions that create policy ideas used to alter the organization and overall operation of the [[Policy|policy-making]] and [[Varieties of Capitalism|production process]]. Knowledge regimes are beneficial for the implementation of public policy because they introduce new sets of data, research, theories, recommendations, and many other influential ideas directed towards an end goal of [[Competition (economics)|economic competition]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Campbell, J. L., Pedersen, O. K. (2007). Knowledge Regimes and Comparative Political Economy. Socio-Economic Review, 13(4):679-701. doi:&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi-org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/10.1093/ser/mwv004&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These regimes became increasingly important following WWII when many capitalist societies were facing long periods of high inflation and economic stagnation associated with high levels of unemployment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Campbell, J. L., Pedersen, O. K. (2013). The National Origins of Policy Ideas. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this era, knowledge regimes were used in the study of [[Comparative politics|comparative political economies]], which examined both policymaking regimes as well as production regimes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The information and policies that arises from knowledge regimes differs depending on the [[political economy]] that a state operates in.

In a liberal market economy (LME) with a decentralized, [[open market]], the knowledge regimes tend to be more market-oriented, meaning there are less external constraints from the government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In open markets there is more competition between companies and actors, resulting in a more adversarial environment. In an LME with a more centralized and closed market, there is nonpartisan state-involvement, all the while in a hostile environment. In coordinated market economies (CME) with decentralized, open states, there are strong associational institutional arrangements, which results in more consensus-oriented knowledge regimes whereas in a CME with a centralized closed market, policy changes come from within the state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Depending on the political economy of a state, there are four corresponding [[Knowledge society|knowledge-producing organizations]]. The first organization is composed of scholars who have specific knowledge on a topic; these members tend to be university students and/or professors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another organization is made up of advocacy research units with individuals who have dedicated their time to one given topic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A third organization includes the individuals closely associated with a political party who conduct research that will provide expert advice and analysis for party members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The last knowledge-producing organization includes state research units who are situated within the government and are readily available for members within the government at any given time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
===The fall of the Golden Age===
Capitalist countries began acknowledging the importance of knowledge regimes following the end of the Golden Age;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; this period was characterized by economic stagflation, eventually leading to inflation throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Economic bubbles and crises occur as a result of the processes that countries previously adapted, typically over the past 30 years, which are ingrained into the economy and hard to alter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Perez, C. (2013). Unleashing a Golden Age after the Financial Collapse: Drawing Lessons from History. Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions, 6, 9-23. doi: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/10.1016/j.eist.2012.12.004&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The high rates of stagflation that occurred in the mid 1960s after the end of the Golden Age created the questions of what the adequate policies would be in order to pursue macroeconomic goals of long-term economic growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This era contradicted the traditional Keynesian policy ideas, which led many advanced countries to turn to the use of theories, data, and ideologies as tools in the fight over different economic policies. This placed heavy emphasis on the creation and use of knowledge regimes.

=== Neoliberalism and globalization ===
{{See also|Neoliberalism|3=History of globalization}}The end of the Golden Age introduced the era of neoliberalism, characterized by a decrease in public spending, lower taxes, and less state intervention.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Through neoliberalism and neoliberal ways of operation, many capitalist countries began globalizing at increased rates, which brought about new forms of economic organizations, such as global outsourcing and international commodity chains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Given this level of globalization, knowledge regimes were developed to create new policies and advise firms on appropriate production measures.

==Varieties of capitalism==
{{Main article|Varieties of Capitalism}}Varieties of capitalism is used to describe is used to describe the way a firm operates in two differentiating political capitalist economies,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hall, P.A. and Soskice, D. (2001). "An Introduction to Varieties of Capitalism," in P.A. Hall and Soskice (Eds). ''Varieties of Capitalism.'' Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; placing the emphasis on the state-firm relationship rather than the state-citizen relationship. The two political economies that nations will operate in are either liberal market economies (LMEs) or coordinated market economies (CMEs). There are five sectors that firms address when developing relationships with the state, including [[industrial relations]], vocational training and [[Vocational education|education]], [[corporate governance]], inter-firm relations, and employees.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Firms use the five sectors to design different policies that are best suited for their political economy.

===Liberal market economies===
Liberal market economies operate in [[Capitalism|capitalist]] nations that use a system of hierarchy and competitive markets to determine relationships between firms and the state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; LMEs operate in highly commodified economies whereby there individuals are particularly dependent on the sale of their own labour as a reliable source of income. The [[commodification]] of labour is strongly affected by the price signals that are indicated by the markets,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and these fluctuating price levels lead to either an increase or decrease in a firm’s willingness to supply and a customer’s willingness to consume.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, R. G., O'Brien, A. P., Serletis, A., and Childs, J. (2013). Macroeconomics. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In liberal market economies, firms will use [[market mechanism]]s to solve any issues incurred, specifically through the exchange of money by buyers and sellers, who have a well-rounded understanding of the value of trade-offs so as to ensure the most efficient distribution of goods and services within an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Market Mechanism. (2017, January 25). Retrieved from [[Market mechanism|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_mechanism]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a liberal market economy, firms require vocational education and training that is either individually funded or provided through on-the-job training to provide firm-specific education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These firms tend to focus their decisions on publicly accessible data of performance, allowing for greater [[venture capital]] and easily switchable assets that result in higher returns for investors. Due to the [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] nature of management, there are very few unions created in the work environment as labour is highly commodified and it is easy for a firm to hire and fire employees. The relationships between firms and employees operate on a contract basis. As a result of the individually funded vocational training, there is greater incentive to pursue individual success through innovation, which is generally funded by the larger venture capital opportunities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

LMEs can also operate alternatively, contingent on the type of market a state follows. If an economy has a more decentralized and open market, knowledge regimes will tend to be me more market-oriented with less external constraints from the government, as is the case with United States; if an economy is more centralized with a closed market, there is more state-led involvement and guidance, much like Great Britain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====United States of America====
[[United States|The United States of America]] is a country with a liberal market [[Economy of the United States|economy]], accentuated by decentralized government with a relatively open market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through the open market, firms and investors are able to import and export different goods and services with very little interference from the government, allowing for the price levels of those goods and services to be set solely by the supply and demand in the economy.

The [[political economy]] in the United States is run primarily by two political parties, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Since the United States is a highly decentralized state, the two main parties operate using privately funded resources, resulting in a distinct separation of power at the legislative and executive branches of government. The United States demonstrates how a decentralized open market economy tends to have more market-oriented knowledge regimes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Beland, D., and Cox, R. H. (2010). Ideas and Politics in Social Science Research (Eds). Oxford, United Kingdom: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Through privately funded channels, individuals have a higher incentive to create knowledge regimes in attempt to influence the public policy making process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

====Great Britain====
[[Great Britain]] represents a group of countries (Wales, Scotland, England) that operate in an LME with a centralized, closed market. These countries follow a [[Unitary state|unitary system of government]], whereby there is a single power dictating the operations of the country as a whole. The market system in Great Britain operates with greater state involvement and control, and the price levels of goods and services are more commonly dictated by government-imposed market tools, such as tariffs, taxes, and subsidies.

The central authority holds power in both the legislative branch and executive branch of government, allowing the central authority to impose new policies and decisions without opposition from other political parties.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result, knowledge regimes are publicly-funded and not as common as they are in LMEs with an open market. State research units are more prevalent throughout Great Britain and are embedded throughout the civil society, creating more politically tempered knowledge regimes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Coordinated market economies===
Coordinated market economies (CME) are characterized by very little state involvement with firms focused on building close relationships between individuals in managerial positions and employees. Through the strong relationships created within the firm, there is a highly decommodified environment with a strong sense of social entitlement and separation from market dependency and state participation.&lt;ref&gt;Decommodification. (2016, July 5). Retrieved from [[Decommodification|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decommodification]]&lt;/ref&gt; When firms incur a problem of any sort, they use strategic interactions to create a feasible solution. These strategic interactions incorporate employees at every level of the firm so as to ensure opinions and viewpoints from all sectors are being taken into account; this typically allows for a stronger built solution. In addition, firms use strategic interaction to determine at which point the [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] should be set between the firm and their consumers, which establishes the appropriate combination between how much of a product is supplied and subsequently purchased.

In a coordinated market economy, there is publicly-subsidized training to support high-skilled education for greater industry-specific labour needs;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; this is a result of the [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] decisions that are made through strategic interactions. Additionally, there is greater confidence instilled in potential investors through the promotion of dense networks. Through the structure of the market, there are several unions and long-term worker contracts, which ensures job security and decreases the likelihood of hostile takeovers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Due to the interaction and cooperation throughout multiple firms, there is greater society-wide success through innovative tendencies, such as the [[Renewable energy in Germany|green energy industry in Germany.]]

CMEs operate differently depending on if a state has a closed market or an open market. In a CME with a decentralized and open market, such as Germany, there tends to be strong associational institutional arrangements, producing more consensus-oriented knowledge regimes; a CME with a centralized and closed market, such as France, many policy changes are encouraged and led by state involvement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Germany====
[[Germany]] is a country with a coordinated market economy, characterized by a decentralized government with an open market system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Firms in this economy operate through well-established networks, while developing and maintaining relationships to promote and coordinate [[economic activity]]. There is very little state-involvement throughout the market, with the emphasis and responsibility being placed on the firms and corporations to set and adjust prices accordingly. Germany follows a proportional representation electoral system, creating a stronger consensus-based environment whereby policies are formulated at the regional level of government rather than the federal level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Through regional-based policy formulation tactics, there is a higher rate of scholarly research units affiliated with several different universities, churches, and other knowledge-producing institutions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also a stronger incentive for political parties to create their own party research units to be used for future elections and [[Policy cycle|policy-making]] tactics. The knowledge regimes created throughout Germany represent the institutional tendencies that firms rely on, such as the negotiation among different political parties, problem-solving mediation, and general consensus building.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== France ====
[[France]] is a country with a coordinated market economy, distinguished by a central government and a closed market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In France, the central government is the main actor when making economic decisions and solving financial problems; the government holds sole ownership of several of the main infrastructure sectors throughout the country, weakening state-firm relationships. With a central government, the same political party holds control of both the legislative and executive branches, resulting in much of policy making taking place at the national level.

As a result of the highly centralized state, many of the knowledge regimes throughout France emerge from state-led research units, as individuals are given very few incentives or means to create or pursue their own research units. Other knowledge regimes emerge from scholarly research units that are funded through the central government.

==Knowledge producing organizations==
[[Knowledge society|Knowledge regimes]] are organized in different ways depending on the type of political economy they are operating in. There are 4 common knowledge producing organizations, which correspond to either liberal market economies or coordinated market economies. These knowledge producing organizations also differentiate if a country has either a centralized or decentralized government, or if there is an open or closed market.&lt;ref&gt;Almirall, E., and Casadesus-Masanell, R. (2010). Open versus Closed Innovation: A Model of Discovery and Divergence. The Academy of Management Review, 35(1), 27-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic-style scholarly research units ===
Academic research units are made up of academia from many institutions. The most commonly found participants in these units are students and professors, however many firms with a coordinated market economy send their employees to these research units. These units are often publicly funded through the government, although they may be privately funded as well, and tend to be both politically and ideologically impartial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Academic research units are most common in liberal market economies with a decentralized government and open market. Prior to [[World War II|WWII]], many of these research units were privately funded through philanthropic organizations, but following WWII, many governments began providing funding for academic research units by contracting out for policy research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Advocacy research units ===
Advocacy research units are created by individuals who are independently motivated through their own values and morals. These research units are privately funded through organizations that directly correlate to the topic or issue being addressed through the unit. These research units are both politically and ideologically partisan in nature, and are more focused on discrediting research that has already been done by using the media to persuade politicians to alter certain policies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Advocacy research units are most common in political economies with decentralized states and open markets, as politicians are less likely to conform to political party standards and will seek advice through external resources.

=== Party research units ===
Party research units are independently funded research units on behalf of a specific political party. These units are both politically and ideologically biased towards the values of a political party, composed of individuals who conduct research on behalf of the leaders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Political leaders will use the research from these units to pursue designated policy goals that will generate as much public approval and support as possible. These research units are most common in economies that operate through highly decentralized governments with several different political parties running for office during an election.

=== State research units ===
State-led research units are the only form of research unit that does not directly involve the participation of the civil society when conducting research. These units are closely affiliated with specific government departments and ministries that conduct research on a very specific matter that is then reported back to the central authority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These research units operate in economies with centralized and closed markets and are publicly funded through the central government.

{{Confucianism}}
'''Korean Confucianism''' is the form of [[Confucianism]] that emerged and developed in [[Korea]]. One of the most substantial influences in Korean [[intellectual history]] was the introduction of [[Confucius|Confucian]] thought as part of the [[Culture of China|cultural influence]] from [[China]]. Today the legacy of Confucianism remains a fundamental part of Korean society, shaping the moral system, the way of life, social relations between old and young, high culture, and is the basis for much of the legal system. Confucianism in Korea is sometimes considered a pragmatic way of holding a nation together without the civil wars and internal dissent that were inherited from the [[Goryeo]] dynasty.

==Origins of Confucian thought==
[[Confucius]] (孔夫子 ''Kǒng Fūzǐ'', lit. "Master Kong") is generally thought to have been born in 551 BCE and raised by his mother following the death of his father when Confucius was three years old. The Latinized name "Confucius" by which most Westerners recognize him is derived from "''Kong Fuzi''", probably first coined by 16th-century Jesuit missionaries to China. The [[Analects]], or ''Lunyu'' (論語; lit."Selected Sayings"), a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher and his contemporaries, is believed to have been written by Confucius' followers during the [[Warring States period]] (475 BC – 221 BC), achieving its final form during the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD). Confucius was born into the class of ''[[Four occupations|shi]]'' (士), between the aristocracy and the common people. His public life included marriage at the age of 19 that produced a son and a variety of occupations as a farm worker, clerk and book-keeper. In his private life he studied and reflected on righteousness, proper conduct and the nature of government such that by the age of 50 he had established a reputation. This regard, however was insufficient for his success in advocating for a strong central government and the use of diplomacy over warfare as the ideal for international relationships. He is said to have spent his last years teaching an ardent group of followers of the values to be appreciated in a collection of ancient writings loosely identified as the [[Five Classics]]. Confucius is thought to have died in 479 BCE.

Under the succeeding Han Dynasty and [[Tang Dynasty]], Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence. During the [[Song Dynasty]], the scholar [[Zhu Xi]] (AD 1130–1200) added ideas from [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different, and call his way of thinking [[Neo-Confucianism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dimensions of Asian Spirituality: Korean Spirituality|last=Baker|first=Donald|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=June 2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Confucianism held sway in China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam until the 19th century.

==Early developments towards Confucianism in Korea==

===Before Goryeo===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
The nature of early Korean political and cultural organization centered on the clan and the tribe rather than cities and states. A Chinese record of the [[Gojoseon]] Kingdom (1000 BC – 300 BC) labeled the inhabitants of the peninsula as DONG-I or "eastern barbarians" or "eastern bowmen". Though the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1766 BC – 1040 BC) is recognized chiefly for its metallurgical accomplishments, its organizational accomplishments included the invocation of authority through one's ancestors. When the Shang Dynasty was overtaken by the [[Western Zhou]] (1122 BC – 771 BC), the Zhou modified the Shang belief in ancestors belief to invoke the "Mandate of Heaven" as a way of identifying the divine right to rule. The Mandate of Heaven was based on rules of good governance and the emperor was granted the right to rule by heaven as long as those rules of good governance were obeyed. The scattered rule of many semi-autonomous holdings were increasingly brought under the rule of a central government as a Zongfa or "kinship network" though as time went on the territory ruled was far too large for all vassals to be actual blood relatives. Vassals to the king enjoyed hereditary titles and were expected to provide labor and fighting forces as circumstances merited. In these many ways, the Gojoseon kingdom would have been “validated” by their “big brother” to the south, and while the Gojoseon king would still rule, the “Mandate of Heaven” lay obligations on him to rule justly and fairly and for the benefit of his people and not just his favorites or relatives. As the Western Zhou declined, China entered into a period known as the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771 BC – 471BC) and the "kinship network" also declined. Control of many feudal holdings fell to feudal lords and knights, or "fighting gentlemen", (C. SHI). Unbound by family relationships, these men were free to attack their neighbors and accrue holdings. It was into this period, then, that Confucius was born and spent his entire life seeming to strive for the construction of a governmental ideal in the nature of the Zhou centralized government. However, in 109 BC the Han Emperor, Wu-Ti overwhelmed Gojoseon by both land and sea and established four bases, or "commanderies", [[Four Commanderies of Han]] in the region as a way to stabilize the area for trade. The subsequent introduction of four separate administrations to oversee the region only served to prolong the divided nature of the Korean peninsula and hamper an adoption of the Confucian model.

As the Three Kingdoms Period emerged from the Four Commanderies, each Kingdom sought ideologies under which their populations could be consolidated and authority could be validated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Traditional Korea a Cultural History|last=Joe|first=Wanne J.|publisher=Chung'ang University Press|year=June 1972|isbn=|location=Seoul, Korea|pages=46–86|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its introduction to the kingdom of [[Baekje]] in 338 AD, [[Korean Buddhism]] spread rapidly to all of the states of the Three Kingdoms Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Traditional Korea A Cultural History|last=Joe|first=Wanne J.|publisher=Chung'ang University Press|year=June 1972|isbn=|location=Seoul, Korea|pages=112–127|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Korean Shamanism]] had been an integral part of Korean culture extending back to earliest time, Buddhism was able to strike a balance between the people and their administration by arbitrating the responsibilities of one to the other.

===Goryeo period===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
By the time of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty (918–1392) the position, influence, and status of Buddhism far exceeded its role as a mere religious faith. Buddhist temples, originally established as acts of faith had grown into influential landholdings replete with extensive infra-structure, cadre, tenants, slaves and commercial ventures. The state observed a number of Buddhist holidays during the year where the prosperity and security of the nation were inextricably tied to practices and rites that often mixed Buddhist and indigenous Korean beliefs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As in China, Buddhism  divided into the more urban faith rooted religious texts and the more contemplative faith of the rural areas. This emphasis on texts and learning produced a "monk examination" wherein the Buddhist clergy could vie with Confucian scholars for positions in the local and national government. During this time, Confucian thought remained in the shadow of its Buddhist rival, vying for the hearts and minds of Korean culture, but with growing antagonism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With the fall of Goryeo, the position of the landed aristocracy crumbled to be replaced by the growing power of the Korean illiterati who advocated strenuously for land reform. Interest in Chinese literature during the Goryeo Dynasty had encouraged the spread of [[Neo-Confucianism]], in which the older teachings of Confucius had been melded to [[Taoism]] and Buddhism. Neo-Confucian adherents could now offer the new Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910) an alternative to the influence of Buddhism. In Goryeo, King Gwangjong (949–975) had created the [[Gwageo|national civil service examinations]], and King Seongjong (1083–1094) was a key advocate for Confucianism by establishing the Gukjagam, the highest educational institution of the Goryeo dynasty. This was enhanced, in 1398, by the [[Sunggyungwan]] – an academy with a Neo-Confucian curriculum – and the building of an altar at the palace, where the king would worship his ancestors. Neo-Confucian thought, with its emphasis on Ethics and the government's moral authority provided considerable rationale for land reform and redistribution of wealth. Rather than attack Buddhism outright, Neo-Confucian critics simply continued to criticize the system of Temples and the excesses of the clergy.

==Neo-Confucianism in the Joseon dynasty==
{{main article|Neo-Confucianism in Korea}}
[[File:Cho Kwang-jo in 1750.jpg|150px|thumb|Portrait of Jo Gwang-jo]]

By the time of [[King Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong]] (ruled 1418–1450), all branches of learning were rooted in Confucian thought. Korean Confucian schools were firmly established, most with foreign educated scholars, large libraries, patronage of artisans and artists, and a curriculum  of 13 to 15 major Confucian works. Branches of [[Buddhism in Korea]] were still tolerated outside of the major political centers. In Ming China (1368–1644), [[Neo-Confucianism]] had been adopted as the state ideology. The new [[Joseon]] Dynasty (1392–1910)&lt;ref name="Baker53" /&gt; followed suit and also adopted Neo-Confucianism as the primary belief system among scholars and administrators. [[Jo Gwang-jo]]'s efforts to promulgate Neo-Confucianism among the populace had been followed by appearance of Korea's two most prominent Confucian scholars, [[Yi Hwang]] (1501–1570) and [[Yi I]] (1536–1584), who are often referred to by their pen names ''Toe gye'' and ''Yul gok''. Having supplanted all other models for the Korean nation-state, by the start of the 17th century, Neo-Confucian thought experienced first a split between Westerners and Easterners and again, between Southerners and Northerners. Central to these divisions was the question of succession in the Korean monarchy and the manner in which opposing factions should be dealt. A growing number of Neo-Confucian scholars had also begun to question particular metaphysical beliefs and practices. A movement known as [[Silhak]] (lit. "practical learning") posited that Neo-Confucian thought ought be founded more in reform than in maintaining the status quo. Differences among various Confucian and Neo-Confucian schools of thought grew to conflicts as Western countries sought to force open Korean, Chinese and Japanese societies to Western trade, Western technologies and Western institutions. Of particular concern were the growing number of Catholic and Protestant missionary schools which not only taught a Western pedagogy but also Christian religious beliefs. In 1894, Korean Conservatives, nationalists and Neo-Confucians rebelled at what they viewed as the loss of Korean Society and Culture to alien influences by the abandonment of the Chinese classics and Confucian rites.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Dong Hak]] Rebellion—also called the 1894 Peasant War (Nongmin Jeonjaeng)—expanded on the actions of the small groups of the Donghak (lit. Eastern Learning) movement begun in 1892. Uniting into a single peasant guerrilla army (Donghak Peasant Army) the rebels armed themselves, raided government offices and killed rich landlords, traders and foreigners. The defeat of the Dong Hak rebels drove ardent Neo-Confucians out of the cities and into the rural and isolated areas of the country. However, the rebellion had pulled China into the conflict and in direct contention with Japan ([[First Sino-Japanese War]]). With the subsequent defeat of Qing China, Korea was wrested from Chinese influence concerning its administration and development. In 1904, the Japanese defeated Russia ([[Russo-Japanese War]]) ending Russian influence in Korea as well. As a result, Japan annexed Korea as a protectorate in 1910, ending the Joseon kingdom and producing a thirty-year occupation ([[Korea under Japanese rule]]) which sought to substitute Japanese culture for that of Korea. During this period, a Japanese administration imposed Japanese language, Japanese education, Japanese practices and even Japanese surnames on the Korean population predominantly in the large cities and surrounding suburban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Traditional Korea a Cultural History|last=Joe|first=Wanne J.|publisher=Chung'ang University Press|year=June 1972|isbn=|location=Seoul, Korea|pages=356–378|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the isolated areas of Korea, and well into Manchuria, Korean nationals continued to wage a guerrilla war against the Japanese and found sympathy for Neo-Confucian goals of reform and economic parity among the growing Communist movement. With the end of the Japanese occupation, Confucian and Neo-Confucian thought continued to experience neglect if not willful repression during the [[Korean War]] as well as the repressive dictatorships which followed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Contemporary society and Confucianism==

With the fall of the Joseon Dynasty in 1910, Neo-Confucianism lost a lot of its influence.&lt;ref name="Baker53"&gt;Baker, Don.

Confucianism there is not an organized religion, making it hard to easily define a person as Confucian or not.&lt;ref name="Koh192"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Kwang-ok. “The Reproduction of Confucian Culture in Contemporary Korea: An Anthropological Study,” In ''Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity'', edited by Tu Wei-ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 226&lt;/ref&gt; Though its prominence as the dominant ideology has faded, there are a lot of Confucian ideas and practices that still saturate South Korean culture and daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Kwang-ok. “The Reproduction of Confucian Culture in Contemporary Korea: An Anthropological Study,” In ''Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity'', edited by Tu Wei-ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KimTu225"&gt;Kim, Kwang-ok. “The Reproduction of Confucian Culture in Contemporary Korea: An Anthropological Study,” In ''Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity'', edited by Tu Wei-ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koh, Byong-ik. “Confucianism in Contemporary Korea,” In ''Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity'', edited by Tu Wei-ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 199&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Confucian respect for education remains a vital part of South Korean culture.&lt;ref name="BakerU4"&gt;Baker, Donald. “The Transformation of Confucianism in 20th-century Korea: How it has lost most of its metaphysical underpinnings and survives today primarily as ethical rhetoric and heritage rituals” Unpublished paper. p 4&lt;/ref&gt; The civil service examinations were the gateway to prestige and power for a follower of Confucianism in the Joseon Dynasty. Today, exams continue to be an important aspect of South Korean life. The content of what is studied has changed over the years. Confucian teachings were replaced by other topics, such as foreign languages, modern history, economics, science, and mathematics. Like Confucianism from the past, a lot of emphasis is placed on the ability to study and memorize.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Ezra. ''The Four Little Dragons'' (Harvard University Press, 1991) p 96&lt;/ref&gt;  Since exams are so important for gaining admission to better schools and jobs, a typical student’s entire life is oriented toward preparing to pass the necessary exams.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Ezra. ''The Four Little Dragons'' (Harvard University Press, 1991) p 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps some of the strongest evidences of continuing Confucian influence can be found in South Korean family life. It is seen not just in South Korea’s emphasis on family and group-oriented ways of living, but also in the Confucian rituals that are still commonly performed today, the ancestor memorial services. It is a way of showing respect for deceased parents, grandparents, and ancestors, and is a way of showing Confucian filial piety.&lt;ref name="Baker53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh195"&gt;Koh, Byong-ik. “Confucianism in Contemporary Korea,” In ''Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity'', edited by Tu Wei-ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 195&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the memorial services have been changed to fit with religious views. This is an example of how Confucianism has melded with religion in South Korea, rather than competing against it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Baker, Don. ''Korean Spirituality'' (University of Hawai’i Press, 2008). p 138&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the “Guideline for Family Rituals” was made law. It declared that ancestral ceremonies can only be held for one’s parents and grandparents, simplified the funeral ceremonies, and reduced the allowed mourning period. The law is not strictly enforced, and no one has been charged for violating it.&lt;ref name="Koh195"/&gt;

In more recent years, there has been a move away from the traditional Confucian idea of complete respect for and submission to parental authority. It can be seen in how marriage has become less of a family decision, and more of an individual’s choice.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Donald. “The Transformation of Confucianism in 20th-century Korea: How it has lost most of its metaphysical underpinnings and survives today primarily as ethical rhetoric and heritage rituals” Unpublished paper. p 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confucian emphasis on the importance of the family and the group over the individual has been extended to South Korean business, as well.  Employees are expected to regard the workplace as a family, with the head of the company as the patriarch who enjoys exclusive privileges while the workers are expected to work harder. The businesses tend to operate on Confucian ethics, such as the importance of harmonious relations among the employees and loyalty to the company. Importance is placed on attributes such as differences in age, kinship status, sex, and sociopolitical status.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Kwang-ok. “The Reproduction of Confucian Culture in Contemporary Korea: An Anthropological Study,” In ''Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity'', edited by Tu Wei-ming, (Harvard University Press, 1996) p 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim44"&gt;Kim, Andrew Eungi &amp; Gil-sung Park. “Nationalism, Confucianism, work ethic and industrialization in South Korea,” Journal of Contemporary Asia 33:1 (2003) p 44. Available at http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00472330380000041#.UqhOpPRDvh4&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucian ethical rhetoric is still used in contemporary South Korea. Other religions will incorporate it into discussions on proper human behavior. It can be found in the government and in the business world being used to encourage people to put the needs of the group above their own individual needs.&lt;ref name="Baker53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Donald. “The Transformation of Confucianism in 20th-century Korea: How it has lost most of its metaphysical underpinnings and survives today primarily as ethical rhetoric and heritage rituals” Unpublished paper. p 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Confucian philosophy going back to the 15th Century had relegated Korean women to little more than extensions of male dominance and producers of requisite progeny.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} This traditional view of the social role of women is fading away.&lt;ref name="BakerU4"/&gt; There is an increasing amount of women students holding good positions in universities and the work force, as well as in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Donald. “The Transformation of Confucianism in 20th-century Korea: How it has lost most of its metaphysical underpinnings and survives today primarily as ethical rhetoric and heritage rituals” Unpublished paper. p 6&lt;/ref&gt; The former president of South Korea, [[Park Geun-hye]], is female.

The arts still maintain major traditions: [[Korean Pottery]], the [[Korean Tea Ceremony]], [[Korean Gardens]], and [[Korean flower arrangement]] follow Confucian principles and a Confucian aesthetic. Scholarly calligraphy and poetry also continue, in much fewer numbers, this heritage. In films, [[school stories]] of manners and comic situations within educational frames fit well into the satires on Confucianism from earlier writings. Loyalty to school and devotion to teachers is still an important genre in popular comedies.

With Neo-Confucianism taken out of the school curricula and removed from its prominence in the daily life of Koreans, the sense that something essential to Korean history is missing led to a rebirth of Confucianism in South Korea in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Koh193"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KimTu225"/&gt;

It is difficult to find accurate information regarding Confucianism in North Korean religion or practices.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Baker, Don. ''Korean Spirituality'' (University of Hawai’i Press, 2008). p 145&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Juche|Juche ideology]] does encourage the Confucian virtues of loyalty, reverence, and obedience.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Don. ''Korean Spirituality'' (University of Hawai’i Press, 2008). p 150&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Kuno Berthold Fischer''' (23 July 1824 – 5 July 1907) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]], a historian of philosophy and a critic.

==Biography==
[[File:Kuno fischer grab.JPG|thumb|His grave in Heidelberg]]
After studying philosophy at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Halle|Halle]],
became a [[privatdocent]] at [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] in 1850. The [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] government in 1853 laid an embargo on his teaching owing to his liberal ideas, but the effect of this was to rouse considerable sympathy for his views, and in 1856 he obtained a professorship at [[University of Jena|Jena]], where he soon acquired great influence by the dignity of his personal character. In 1872, on [[Eduard Zeller]]'s move to Berlin, Fischer succeeded him as professor of philosophy and the history of modern [[German literature]] at Heidelberg.

He was a brilliant lecturer and possessed a remarkable gift for clear exposition. His fame rests primarily on his work as a historian and commentator of philosophy. As far as his philosophical views were concerned, he was, generally speaking, a follower of the [[Hegelianism|Hegelian school]]. His writings in this direction, especially his interpretation of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], involved him in a quarrel with [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|F. A. Trendelenburg]], professor of philosophy at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], and his followers.  In 1860, Fischer's ''Kants Leben und die Grundlagen seiner Lehre'' (Kant's life and the foundations of his doctrine) lent the first real impulse to the so-called “return to Kant.”

In honor of his 80th birthday, celebrated in 1904, [[Otto Liebmann]], [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Theodor Lipps]] and others published ''Die Philosophie im Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts. Festschrift für Kuno Fischer'' (Heidelberg, 1907).

==Philosophy==
One of Fischer's most significant and lasting contributions to philosophy was the use of the [[empiricism]]/[[rationalism]] distinction in categorising philosophers, particularly those of the 17th and 18th centuries. These include [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]] in the empiricist category and [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[G.W. Leibniz]] in the rationalist category. Empiricism, it is said, claims that human knowledge is derived from sensation, i.e. experience, while rationalism claims that certain knowledge can be acquired before experience through pure principles. Although influential, in more recent times this distinction has been questioned as anachronistic in its failure to represent precisely the exact claims and methodologies of the philosophers it categorises.

==Reception==
Kuno Fischer's ''History of Modern Philosophy'' had a strong impact on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and his view on modern philosophy, particularly on [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Urs Sommer]]: Nietzsche’s Readings on Spinoza. A Contextualist Study, Particularly on the Reception of Kuno Fischer, in: Journal of Nietzsche Studies 43/2 (2012), pp. 156–184.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and [[W. Somerset Maugham]] were amongst his students.

[[Hermann Weyl]], writing about pre-WWII academic life in Germany, told the following anecdote about Fischer:

:A little anecdote of German university life in the nineties may illustrate the point.  Kuno Fischer, a second-rate philosopher at Heidelberg, was one day disturbed by the noise of workers who were putting in new cobblestones in the street before his house.  He had at that time been offered a professorship in Berlin.  So he opened his window and shouted to the workmen, "If you don't stop that noise at once, I'll accept the call to Berlin".  Whereupon the foreman ran to the mayor, he summoned the Stadtbaumeister and they decided to postpone repair of the street until after the beginning of the academic vacation.&lt;ref&gt;H. Weyl, "Universities and Science in Germany" (1953), in Weyl's ''Gesammelte Abhandlungen'' (collected essays), Band IV, p. 538.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leibniz's gap''' is a [[philosophy of mind]] term that is used to refer to the problem that thoughts cannot be observed or perceived solely by examining [[brain]] properties, events, and processes. Here the word 'gap' is a [[metaphor]] of a subquestion regarding the [[mind–body problem]] that allegedly must be answered in order to reach more profound understanding of [[consciousness]] and [[emergence]]. A [[theory]] that could correlate brain phenomena with [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomena would "bridge the gap." The term is named after [[Gottfried Leibniz]] who first presented the problem in his work ''[[The Monadology]]'' in 1714. Leibniz's passage describing the gap goes as follows:

{{cquote|It must be confessed, moreover, that perception, and that which depends on it, are inexplicable by mechanical causes, that is, by figures and motions, And, supposing that there were a mechanism so constructed as to think, feel and have perception, we might enter it as into a mill. And this granted, we should only find on visiting it, pieces which push one against another, but never anything by which to explain a perception. This must be sought, therefore, in the simple substance, and not in the composite or in the machine.|author=Gottfried Leibniz|source=[http://people.uvawise.edu/philosophy/phil206/Leibniz.html ''Monadology'']}}

Leibniz himself sought to bridge the gap by introducing monads to explain the existence of immaterial, eternal souls. Leibniz's gap, however, applies to [[materialism]] and [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] alike. This brought late 19th century scientists to conclude that psychology must build on [[introspection]]; thus [[introspectionism]] was born. [[Computationalism]] seeks to answer the problem proposed by Leibniz's gap through functional analysis of the brain and its processes. Today the term Leibniz's gap is still in wide use in scientific debate as the mind body problem remains unsolved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3415">'''Moral certainty''' is a concept of intuitive [[probability]]. It means a very high degree of probability, sufficient for action, but short of absolute or mathematical certainty.

==Origins==
The notion of different degrees of certainty can be traced back to a statement in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Nicomachean Ethics]] that one must be content with the kind of certainty appropriate to different subject matters, so that in practical decisions one cannot expect the certainty of mathematics. &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) pp. 64–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase ''moralis certitudo'' was first used by the [[France|French]] philosopher [[Jean Gerson]] about 1400,&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Braun/E. Vallance eds., ''The Renaissance Conscience'' (2011) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a basis for moral action that could (if necessary) be ''less'' exact than Aristotelian practical knowledge, thus avoiding the dangers of [[philosophical scepticism]] and opening the way for a benevolent [[casuistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Braun, p. 12 and p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] mentions occurrences in English from 1637. 

==Law==
In law, moral (or 'virtual') certainty has been associated with [[verdict]]s based on certainty [[beyond a reasonable doubt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=1281&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C Legal definition of "moral certainty"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral certainty, a quantum of evidence of about 100 percent proof, is required in two kinds of cases:
# In a criminal prosecution, when no [[direct evidence]] exists, the [[circumstantial evidence]] must be ''morally certain''; see ''[[Lizzie Borden]]''.
# In a [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]] case, when a [[putative father]] has been adjudicated to be the actual father by [[clear and convincing evidence]], then ''moral certainty'' is required to disprove [[Parent|paternity]], the [[Blame|onus]] being moved to the newly found father.


Legal debate about instructions to seek a moral certainty has turned on the changing definitions of the phrase over time. Whereas it ''can'' be understood as an equivalent to 'beyond reasonable doubt', in another sense moral certainty refers to a firm conviction which ''does not'' correlate but rather opposes evidentiary certainty:&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Moore, ''Mass Communication Law and Ethics'' (1999) pp. 52–3&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. one may have a firm subjective gut feeling of guilt – a feeling of moral certainty – without the evidence necessarily justifying a guilty conviction.

"'''Music, When Soft Voices Die'''" is a major poem by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], written in 1821 and first published in ''Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley'' in 1824 in London by John and [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Henry L. Hunt]] with a preface by [[Mary Shelley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Posthumous_poems.html?id=DNwGAAAAQAAJ |title=Shelley, Percy Bysshe.

==Text==

Music, When Soft Voices Die

Music, when soft voices die,&lt;br /&gt;
Vibrates in the memory;&lt;br /&gt;
Odours, when sweet violets sicken,&lt;br /&gt;
Live within the sense they quicken.

Rose leaves, when the rose is dead,&lt;br /&gt;
Are heap'd for the belovèd's bed;&lt;br /&gt;
And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,&lt;br /&gt;
Love itself shall slumber on.

==Summary==

The poem was published as "To---" in 1824 under Miscellaneous Poems in two stanzas of four couplets each containing four lines in ''Posthumous Poems''.

The theme of the poem is the endurance of the memories of events and of sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Havens, Raymond D. "Structure and Prosodic Pattern in Shelley's Lyrics". ''PMLA'', Vol. 65, No. 6 (December 1950), pp. 1076–1087.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Shelley edited the poems and wrote the preface to the collection. She described the poems: "Many of the Miscellaneous Poems, written on the spur of the occasion, and never retouched, I found among his manuscript books, and have carefully copied: I have subjoined, whenever I have been able, the date of their composition."&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Percy Bysshe. ''Posthumous Poems.'' London: Hunt, 1824.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Irving. "Shelley's 'Music, When Soft Voices Die': Text and Meaning." ''The Journal of English and Germanic Philology'', Vol. 59, No. 3 (July 1960), pp. 430–438.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unterecker, John. "Shelley's 'To ---(Music, When Soft Voices Die')." ''Explicator'', XV (1957), item 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, E. D., Jr. "Further Comment on 'Music, When Soft Voices Die'." ''The Journal of English and Germanic Philology'', Vol. 60, No. 2 (April 1961), pp. 296–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical compositions==

Many composers and musicians have set the poem to music with vocal accompaniment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=14938 |title=Vocal settings of "Music, when soft voices die" |publisher=The LiederNet Archive |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the composers are [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]] as a three-part song in 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtgiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1060&amp;lpg=PA1060&amp;dq=music+when+soft+voices+die+charles+wood+1914&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_Nd-dcw1Nr&amp;sig=xJ-pM5elz9cARNGG9oIQaQxrFEM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u-wqT7PtDMiIsQLVzviSDg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=music%20when%20soft%20voices%20die%20charles%20wood%201914&amp;f=false |title=Catalog of Copyright Entires, U.S. Library of Congress |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Bridge]], for mixed chorus a capella, in 1904, [[Eric Nelson (musician)|Eric Nelson]] in 1999, Canadian composer Stephen Chatman, as a part of his set "There Is Sweet Music Here," in 1993, Sir Charles [[Hubert Parry]] in 1897, Three Songs, Opus 12, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rvwsociety.com/workschoral.html |title=Ralph Vaughan Williams Society |publisher=Rvwsociety.com |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415051430/http://www.rvwsociety.com/workschoral.html |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergei Taneyev]], Opus 17, No. 3, ''Pust' otsvuchit'', in 1905, [[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]] for mixed chorus in 1907, [[Peter Warlock]] in 1911 (two versions), [[Liza Lehmann]] for voice and piano, [[Henry Cowell]] in 1922, [[Jack Gibbons]], Opus 17, [[Samuel Barber]], for piano and voice in 1926, [[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]], [[Quincy Porter]] in 1947, [[Roger Quilter]], for voice and piano, Opus 25, No. 5, in 1927, [[John Harbison]] for SATB choir and organ or harpsichord in 1966, Julie Knowles for SSA chorus and piano in 1982, Victor C.

'''Panagiotis Kondylis''' ({{lang-el|Παναγιώτης Κονδύλης}}; {{lang-de|Panajotis Kondylis}}; 17 August 1943 – 11 July 1998) was a Greek philosopher, intellectual historian, translator and publications manager who principally wrote in German, in addition to translating most of his work into Greek. He can be placed in a tradition of thought best exemplified by [[Thucydides]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref&gt;Other thinkers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Montaigne]], [[Hobbes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Montesquieu]], [[La Mettrie]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Marquis de Sade|De Sade]], [[Clausewitz]], [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]], [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Durkheim]], [[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer]], [[Carl Schmitt|Schmitt]] and [[Raymond Aron|Aron]] were among the important points of reference in his thinking, notwithstanding the significant differences he had with some of these writers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kondylis produced a body of work that referred directly to primary sources in no less than six languages (Greek, Latin, German, French, Italian and English), and had little regard for what he considered intellectual fashions and bombastic language used to camouflage logical inconsistencies and lack of first-hand knowledge of primary sources.

==Life==
Born in 1943 in the small community of Drouva (Δρούβα) near [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Greece]], where the Kondylis' family house is still standing today, he moved with his father, who was a military officer, at the age of six to [[Kifisia]], [[Athens]], where he attended school. Kondylis studied classical philology and philosophy at the [[University of Athens]] (at which time he was drawn to [[Marxism]]),&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Lauermann: Das Ausweichen vor Spinoza ... Zugleich: Hommage à Panajotis Kondylis. In: Fünfzehnte Etappe (Bonn, Oktober 2000), p. 72, which relates that during the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]] Kondylis had been a member of the [[Greek Communist Party]]; df. Κονδύλης, Π. ''Το Αόρατο Χρονολόγιο της Σκέψης (ΑΧΣ)'', Νεφέλη, 1998, pp. 45, 51. However, in Kondylis's first known article, which most likely dates from 1964, entitled «Οι επαναστατικές ιδεολογίες και ο μαρξισμός» ("Revolutionary Ideologies and Marxism") in ''Μελαγχολία και Πολεμική''. Athens: Θεμέλιο, 2002 (''Melancholy and Polemics'') Kondylis writes about the ideologisation of Marxism (as occurs with all initially revolutionary movements such as Christianity), and its distortion and conversion into a party-political and bureaucratic means of control, suggesting he had already moved away from dogmatic "faith" in communist revolution by the age of 21.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as philosophy, medieval and modern history and political science at the Universities of [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt]] and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]. During his postgraduate studies at Heidelberg he earned his PhD (under the supervision of [[Dieter Henrich]]) with the 700-page study of the origins of post-Kantian German idealism, including the early years of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]]: ''Die Entstehung der Dialektik'' (''The Genesis of Dialectics''), which supported views considered innovative and provocative at the time, including illuminating the pre-history of Marxism and the world-theoretical presuppοsitions of the [[Marxist philosophy of history]]. Outstanding German historians [[Werner Conze]] and [[Reinhart Koselleck]] were important guiding influences during his formative years in Heidelberg.

[[File:Greece 2009 061.jpg|thumb|right|The house of Panagiotis Kondylis's parents in Drouvas, [[Ancient Olympia]]. Kondylis moved to [[Kifisia]], Athens, at the age of six]] Kondylis was awarded the [[Goethe Medal]] in 1991. As a recipient of the [[Humboldt Prize]] he also was in 1994/95 a fellow of the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin|Wissenschaftskolleg]] in Berlin. Kondylis, though, was independent – a ''Privatgelehrter'' (private scholar) who never aspired to an academic career apart from one attempt in the early 1980s when he entered into discussions with the Philosophy Department of the [[University of Athens]], applying for a placement. His application was confronted with the distrust of the conservative faculty of the philosophical department. Although Kondylis was supported by the then well-known professor Theofilos Veikos, he still had to contend with the opposition of many University based philosophers and subsequently did not succeed in commencing a career as an academic. Thereafter, he never expressed any wish for an academic career (expressing the view that "academic philosophy is dead and buried"),&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Bernd A. Laska of 16 June 1985, in [http://www.lsr-projekt.de/kondylis.html Bernd A. Laska: ''Panajotis Kondylis – unfreiwilliger Pate des LSR-Projekts'']; 
Cf. [http://www.wienerzeitung.at/themen_channel/wz_reflexionen/zeitgenossen/272603_Rudolf-Burger.html ''Interview with Rudolf Burger''] in: Wiener Zeitung, 1. Juni 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; although he was offered a lot of honorary placements, including by the [[University of Ioannina]], which he politely refused.

He died in Athens in 1998. His library of some 5000 titles based in his house in [[Politeia, Athens|Politeia]], [[Athens]] was donated by his sister, Melpo Kondylis (Μέλπω Κονδύλη), to the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in which a special "Kondylis" section exists in the campus library. In November 2008 a conference was held in Heidelberg honouring the memory of the late Panagiotis Kondylis. A similar event was held in Greece on 22 May 2008.

==Work==

The great bulk of his corpus was written in German, and most of his writings were translated by Kondylis himself into Greek. He was interested in a number of areas of study including: the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the preceding Renaissance-era critiques of metaphysics; the philosophy of war and [[Clausewitz]], as well as the work of [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]]; Western bourgeois culture and its decline; Conservatism; [[Postmodernity|post-Modernity]], and International Affairs. He also translated into modern Greek classic works by authors such as: [[Xenophon]], [[James Burnham|Burnham]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Marx]], [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]], [[Cesare Pavese|Pavese]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Nicolas Chamfort|Chamfort]], [[Antoine de Rivarol|Rivarol]], [[Schiller]], [[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer]] and [[Carl Schmitt]]. Moreover, he was publications manager of the Greek-language "Philosophical and Political Library" (editions Γνώση (1983–1998; 60 volumes)) and "Modern European Civilisation" (editions Νεφέλη (1997–2000; 12 volumes)), producing modern Greek translations of renowned texts by authors as diverse as: [[Hobbes]], [[Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], ancient Greek [[Sophists]] and [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], [[Serge Moscovici|Moscovici]], [[Georges Sorel|Sorel]], [[Heidegger]], [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]], [[Robert Michels|Michels]], [[Raymond Aron|Aron]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Derrida]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Hauser]] et al., and histories of modern Greek philosophy. Kondylis's best known books are: ''Die Aufklärung'' (''The Enlightenment'') and ''Macht und Entscheidung'' (''Power and Decision'') (see below).

===Underlying themes===

Kondylis claimed to be "scientific" in the sense of writing "descriptively" (and explanatorily), in separating ''Is'' (facts) from ''Ought'' (values), rather than writing "prescriptively" or "normatively". The thread running through all of Kondylis's writings (whether primarily focussed on the history of ideas, social ontology, historical sociology, geopolitics, etc.) is his position that the historical plethora and variety of individual, social and theoretical behaviour or endeavour unfolds against a backdrop of the anthropological law (or constants) of "power" and "decision". Such "power" and "decision" continually traverse a friend–foe spectrum within historically formed (and currently dynamic) societies characterised by varying degrees of multi-faceted social relations of individual and collective subjects (in and through which e.g. biological impulses are rationally justified and embellished so that their voice is heard as the command of ethics; the impulse of self-preservation manifests itself as "meaning of life"; and sexual urges are dressed up as "love"). Orientation, identity formation, hierarchisation, interpretation, the production of normative systems, ideologies, rationality as self-control and the abandonment or postponement of immediate gratification, etc., are all means through which power relations manifest themselves socially and distinguish human civilisations from the basic instinctual behaviour and unrationalised raw violence of the animal kingdom (in short: humans accept "meaning" in seeking power, whereas animals do not). As human societies become more complex (and materially wealthier), power and its self-intensification ceases to often coincide with mere physical superiority (as in the case of primitive conditions), and power is often objectivised through greater use of historically determined and relative ((re-)interpreted and often contested) symbols and values. However, raw physical power is always at least potentially available for use by individual and collective subjects who wish to maintain and expand their power. Even scientific knowledge is not beyond historical determination and polemical manipulation – but only scientific knowledge, if it consistently separates ''Is'' from ''Ought'', can explain in terms of corroboration with empirical reality the abundant variety of human existence and "knowing".&lt;ref&gt;Kondylis, P.

===''The Political and Man''===

His final major work ''Das Politische und der Mensch'' (''The Political and Man'') remained unfinished at the time of his death, but nevertheless managed to present a unified social-scientific theory or "value-free" description of social phenomena, encompassing socio-ontological, sociological and historical aspects of the study of human affairs. Kondylis's conception of social ontology does not offer any fixed causalities or laws nor does it say what people ought to do or not do in any given situation or how their social action should unfold. The task of social ontology is accordingly not to reduce fluid and varied phenomena to basic samples and basic genetic factors; what is sought is to show the spectrum of the forces and factors, which can only be constituted and become discernible from the – irreducible and inexhaustible – diversity of form. Such forces and factors, of course, include certain constants such as striving for self-preservation through the expanding of one's own power, and the friend–foe relation, which exist in all societies and are actualised in concrete historical situations and therefore have concrete dimension and content e.g. when the dominant paradigm might be theocentrism or anthropocentrism or mass democratic post-Modernity. Much of the nearly completed first volume (three volumes had been planned by Kondylis) is an analysis of mass-democratic ideology in the social sciences while also dealing with methodological and theoretical questions such as the distinction between "socio-ontic observation" and "socio-historical observation" and the three key aspects of the social: the social relation, the political and man. Moreover, Kondylis examines the social relation as regards its "internal" mechanism of subjectivity and "external" mechanism of action, the friend–foe polarity and the social relation's continuity, in addition to exploring the concepts of understanding and rationality by way of an extensive examination and/or critique of numerous renowned authors such as [[Martin Buber]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Alfred Schütz]], [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Georg Simmel]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Leopold von Wiese]].

===The Enlightenment and intellectual history===

Apart from being a comprehensive survey of the major polemical trends in the European History of Ideas from the end of the Middle Ages and the subsequent turn against [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[Rationalism]] by many mainstream and other Enlightenment figures{{Who|date=June 2010}} promoting a "new" or revived sensualism, until the post-Kantian period of Schelling and Hegel, ''Die Aufklärung'' (''The Enlightenment''), together with ''Die neuzeitliche Metaphysikkritik'' (''Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics''), can be seen as analyses of the European Modern Era's struggle against value-relativity and nihilism, which were the logical conclusion of the overall rationalist positioning in the European Modern Era. Against the Aristotelian metaphysics of essence, the notion of function was recruited, and then the danger of breaking-down all essences into variable functions had to be confronted with the invention of new beings: "Nature", "Man" and "History" thus succeeded God and the (transcendental) Spirit. However, the notion of function totally prevailed in the course of the 20th century in the context of overthrowing essence on a global scale (notwithstanding the ongoing and socially inevitable influence of various ideologies and religions); see ''The Decline of Bourgeois Thought- and Life-Forms'' below. Throughout these books, self-preservation and power appear as key concepts in interpreting human affairs, and in setting aside all dualisms and Platonisms, all the traditional distinctions between Hither and Thither, the ideal and reality, understanding and volition. From the point of view of the history of ideas, while the philosophers who did systematically set aside such dualisms were few and far between (e.g. [[Machiavelli]], [[Hobbes]], [[Spinoza]], [[La Mettrie]], [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]], and to a lesser extent, [[Diderot]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius|Helvetius]], [[Holbach]], [[David Hume|Hume]]), quantitatively, philosophers expounding versions of the traditional distinctions mentioned above, or at least maintained a normative stance necessary to seek social influence, prevailed for much of the European Modern Era, and Kondylis also analysed the basic stance(s) of such and other thinkers including: [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|Alembert]], [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Condorcet]], [[Grotius]], [[Hegel]], [[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Maupertuis]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Rousseau]], [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]], in considerable detail, as well as referring to other (pre-)Enlightenment thinkers (in addition to those mentioned above) such as: [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Aquinas]], [[Aristotle]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]], [[Descartes]], [[Erasmus]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galilei]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Plato]], [[Pufendorf]], [[Bernardino Telesio|Telesio]], etc.. In both ''The Enlightenment'' and ''Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics'', Kondylis runs a compelling interpretative thread through the constant reformulation of concepts and positioning and apparently overwhelming volume of argumentation, from the late Middle Ages until the 19th century (and 20th century in the case of ''Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics'', which includes analyses of: [[Bergson]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]], [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], [[Heidegger]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], [[Nietzsche]], [[William of Ockham|Occam]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Salutati]], [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]], [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], [[Wittgenstein]], and [[Jacopo Zabarella|Zabarella]]), producing scholarly works that not only have a handbook or reference text quality but also an ability to provide insight into the motive forces of development of, and changes in, the history of ideas in the European Modern Era (see also ''Conservatism'' below) before the onset of the new Planetary Era.

===''Power and De-cisio''===
[[File:Macht und entscheidung.jpg|thumb|320px|right|The cover for the German edition of Power and De-cisio]]
In ''Macht und Entscheidung'' (''Power and De-cisio)&lt;ref&gt;The term De-cisio is provided by the writer in his introduction as the Latin translation of Entscheidung is preferred over Decision since the Kondylis is referring to philosophical decisionism, the abstraction and re-arrangement of the external world by the subject in such a way that it appears meaningful to her/him. See "Introduction" in Panajotis Kondylis, ''Macht und Entscheidung'', Klett-Cotta, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;'' Kondylis set forth the theoretical basis for his attitude to existence and his own endeavours as an author and social scientist. "Decision" is here conceptualised differently from its hitherto known varieties in [[decisionism]]; now it appears as a theory about the emergence of individual and collective worldviews. Such an emergence as a function of power i.e. self-preservation through self-enhancement (or self-intensification), always refers to enemy positioning, and as such always contains normative elements within itself. Kondylis examines the claimed bindingness and also ambiguity inherent in all ideologies and social institutions. Drawing from anthropology, philosophy, sociology and history, concepts such as value, value-freedom and nihilism are explored. It is claimed that the infinite variety of human perceptions, beliefs, ideologies, i.e. world-views, are nothing more than an effort to give personal interests a normative form and an objective character, deriving from a "decision" on what means should be used, who should be a friend and who a foe, in the big "Hobbesian" struggle for what is the most primitive and common goal of all humans – self-preservation. Therefore, personal and/or group world-views and ideologies in general are used as a weapon in everyday struggle for the purpose of power claims and self-preservation. Social and historical being and becoming consist of transitory existences – regardless of whether they invoke Reason and ethics or not – seeking power (in any one or more of its countless forms). That is how Nature's (and society's) creatures are, and they cannot do otherwise.

=== Conservatism ===
Kondylis's next book, ''Konservativismus. Geschichtlicher Gehalt und Untergang.'' (''Conservatism. Historical Content and Decline.''), like ''The Enlightenment'', which broke new ground in its novel interpretation of such a pivotal period in European philosophy (see above), went against the grain of conventional wisdom on the history of conservatism understood simply as a reaction to the [[French Revolution]] as articulated by e.g. [[Karl Mannheim]]. Rather, in Kondylis's book, conservatism had already existed as a social and political force since the Middle Ages in which the nobility and its estate system, having derived its legitimacy from a particular conception of law as a privilege, combated emerging egalitarian interpretations of law in the European Modern Era, which encompassed the rise of the modern sovereign state, albeit initially in absolutist guises (among which were the attempt to impose religious tolerance and peace in the aftermath of the Reformation and the religious wars). Nevertheless, the book also examines conservatism as a political force adapting to the reality of the modern sovereign state's eventual triumph and in light of the [[French Revolution]] and beyond. Included is an analysis of how the central themes used in the socialist criticism of capitalism were initially formed in the ideological realm of the counter-Revolution, whose social conveyor of this first anti-capitalist criticism was the patriarchal great-landholder, the older or younger aristocrat, who saw his social existence being eroded and falling apart by the irrepressible march of mercantile-monetary relations, the Industrial Revolution and by individualistic-liberal ideas. What followed was an idealised image of pre-capitalist reality, whereby people lived united by the bonds of blood, tradition and mutual faith and protection, from the earth and in nature, preserving their existential essence from the fragmentation which is imposed by the advanced division of labour and the continuous hunt for material gain in a society cut up into competitive individuals. Key intellectuals during conservatism's history include: [[Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald|Bonald]], [[Edmund Burke|Burke]], [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Juan Donoso Cortés|Cortés]], [[François Fénelon|Fénelon]], [[Karl Ludwig von Haller|Haller]], [[Karl Ernst Jarcke|Jarcke]], [[Joseph de Maistre|de Maistre]], [[Johann Jakob Moser|Moser]], [[Adam Müller|Müller]], [[Radowitz]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]], and [[Friedrich Julius Stahl|Stahl]].

===''Theory of War''===

In ''Theorie des Krieges'' (''Theory of War''), Kondylis opposed [[Raymond Aron]]'s liberal interpretation of [[Clausewitz]]'s theory. According to Aron in ''Penser La Guerre'' Clausewitz was one of the first writers condemning the militarism of military elites and their war-proneness (based on the famous sentence "war is a continuation of politics by other means"). Kondylis claimed that this was a reconstruction not coherent with Clausewitz's thought. Clausewitz was, according to Kondylis, morally indifferent to war from a theoretical point of view, and his propounding of the value of political rule over war had nothing to do with pacifistic claims. For Clausewitz war was just a means in the eternal quest for power in an often anarchical and unsafe world, and as such war could neither be a continuous phenomenon, nor cease altogether. In other words, war arose from the political (i.e. "political communication") in the wider sense of social existence encompassing society as a whole (inclusive of anthropological factors), and whether war occurred at a particular time or not depended on a correlation of social and political forces encompassing collective and individual input into any given state of affairs. Kondylis saw in Clausewitz a general theory of war with sufficiently inclusive and elastic conceptualisation which could cover all forms of strategy – even antithetical forms: from primitive guerrilla warfare to extremely technicised contemporary war, as well as the possibility of terrorism using advanced technology to cripple modern-day societies. Kondylis continued with an analysis of Lenin's, Engels's and Marx's theories of war, articles about military staff and politicians, technological and absolute war, and concluded (in the Greek edition) with an analysis of a possible Greek–Turkish war.

===''The Decline of the Bourgeois Thought''===

In ''Der Niedergang der bürgerlichen Denk- und Lebensformen. Die liberale Moderne und die massendemokratische Postmoderne'' (''The Decline of Bourgeois Thought- and Life-Forms. The Liberal Modern and the mass-democratic Post-modern''), Kondylis used Weberian ideal-typical analysis to outline the great "paradigm shift" of post-Modernity from around 1900 onwards, in bringing to an end the previously dominant bourgeois-liberal hierarchical and humanist world-view, and ushering in a new era of mass-democratic pluralism and leveling of hierarchies based on mass-democratic social formations characterised by, ''inter alia'', historically unprecedented mass production and mass consumption, atomisation and mobility, and, not least of all, the various forms of mass-democratic ideology. To this end, Kondylis made effective use of his distinction between the "synthetic-harmonising thought-form" and the "analytic-combinatory thought-form" in which the latter set aside the former during the same period as the setting-aside of classical bourgeois liberalism by mass democracy, which for the most part occurred as the re-interpretation and changing of liberalism in accordance with the needs of mass democracy, and not always as an open and programmatic clash between the two. The "synthetic-harmonising thought-form" and the "analytic-combinatory thought-form" distinction is applied by Kondylis to his extensive overview of developments in the arts (including literature, music, architecture, the visual arts, cinema), as well as of developments in philosophy, the sciences and commonplace mind-sets and ways of living, mainly from the second half of the 19th century until the cultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.

===''Planetary Politics after the Cold War''===

In ''Planetarische Politik nach dem kalten Krieg'' (''Planetary Politics after the Cold War''), Kondylis dealt with a number of matters e.g. conceptual confusion in the overtly polemical and unhistorical use of "conservative", "liberal" and "(social) democracy"; mass democracy as the world's first international social formation; the impact of communism on the 20th century; and "human rights" as predominantly American ideology but also amenable to interpretations contrary to American interests, i.e. the dissemination of universal human rights ideology will lead to a significant increase in international conflict and increase the worldwide trend towards anomy. The end of the Cold War in particular emerges as a pivotal point in history in which the European Modern Era finds itself in its historical twilight while coming full circle, absorbed by the Planetary Era which the European Modern Era itself inaugurated with the great geographic discoveries of the 15th and 16th centuries. Planetary history gulps down its creator, European history – another one of the blaring examples of the unintended consequences of collective action in history.

Kondylis's published works as a whole can be seen as a unified series of analyses based on an unwavering adherence to empirical fact and logical consistency no matter what aspect of study is being emphasised at any given time. He sought to eliminate artificial academic boundaries between e.g. "philosophy", "anthropology", "economics", "history", "sociology" and "politics" by emphasising the interconnectedness of such disciplines from the point of view of "value-free" i.e. "power claim"-free and non-normative scientific understanding. He thought of himself as "an observer of human affairs" or "writer" or "historian of ideas, social historian and theorist" (always writing by hand), rather than as a "philosopher", producing a body of work that bears little resemblance to any other author, apart from perhaps Max Weber.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1833">Trade negotiators generally refer to Article 13 of the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Agriculture]] as the '''Peace Clause'''. Article 13 holds that domestic support measures and export [[subsidies]] of a WTO Member that are legal under the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture cannot be challenged by other WTO Members on grounds of being illegal under the provisions of another WTO agreement.

The Peace Clause has expired on January 1, 2004. It is now possible, therefore, for [[developing countries]] and nations favoring [[free trade]] in agricultural goods, such as the [[Cairns Group]], to use the [[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|WTO dispute settlement]] mechanism in order to challenge, in particular, [[United States|U.S.]] and [[European Union|EU]] [[export subsidies]] on agricultural products.

Another temporary peace clause was made at the WTO Bali conference in December 2013. It stipulated that no country would be legally barred from food security programs for its own people even if the subsidy breached the limits specified in the WTO [[Agreement on Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/all-you-wanted-to-know-about-peace-clause/article22985323.ece] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20180430171655/https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/all-you-wanted-to-know-about-peace-clause/article22985323.ece])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Placide Frans Tempels''' (18 February 1906 &amp;ndash; 9 October 1977) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Franciscan]] [[missionary]] in the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]] who became famous for his book ''[[Bantu Philosophy]]''.

==Life==
Tempels was born in [[Berlaar]], [[Belgium]].  Born Frans Tempels, he took the name "Placide" on his entry into a [[Franciscan]] [[seminary]] in 1924.  After his ordination to the [[Catholic priesthood|priesthood]] in 1930 he taught for a short time in Belgium before being posted to the [[Belgian Congo]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) in 1933.  He stayed there for twenty-nine years, broken by only two short stays back in Belgium.  In April 1962 he returned to live in a Franciscan [[monastery]] in Berlaar, where he died in 1977.

==''Bantu Philosophy''==
{{Main|Bantu Philosophy}}

Though neither [[Africa]]n nor a [[philosopher]], Tempels had a huge influence on [[African philosophy]] through the publication in 1945 of his book ''La philosophie bantoue'' (published in [[English language|English]] translation in 1959) as ''Bantu Philosophy'').

'''Proportionalism''' is an ethical theory that lies between [[consequentialism|consequential]] theories and [[deontological]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Note that there is a substantial difference between teleology, as it is understood in the Thomistic context, and consequentialism. See {{cite book|last1=Curran|first1=Charles|title=The Catholic Moral Tradition Today: A Synthesis|date=1999|publisher=Georgetown University Press|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequential theories, like [[utilitarianism]], say that an action is right or wrong, depending on the consequences it produces, but deontological theories, such as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[categorical imperative]], say that actions are either intrinsically right or intrinsically wrong. Proportionalist theories like [[rule utilitarianism]], however, say that it is never right to go against a principle unless a proportionate reason would justify it.

In the 1960s, proportionalism was a consequentialist attempt to develop [[natural law]], a principally [[Roman Catholic]] teleological theory most strongly associated with the 13th-century [[scholasticism|scholastic]] theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]], but also found in [[Church Fathers]] such as [[Maximus the Confessor]] and [[John of Damascus]], as well as early pagan schools of philosophy such as [[Stoicism]]. The moral guidelines set down by Roman Catholic [[Magisterium|magisterial]] teachings of Natural Moral Law are mostly upheld in that intrinsically evil acts are still classified so. In certain situations where there is a balance of [[ontic]] goods and ontic evils (ontic evils are those that are not immoral but merely cause pain or suffering, ontic goods are those that alleviate pain or suffering). Proportionalism asserts that one can determine the right course of action by weighing up the good and the necessary evil caused by the action. As a result, proportionalism aims to choose the lesser of evils. [[Pope John Paul II]] rules out the 1960s proportionalism in his encyclicals ''[[Veritatis Splendor]]'', promulgated in 1993 (cf. section 75), and in ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'', 1995 (cf. article 68). Instead he offers an account of moral action based on the object of the act (''finis operis''), the intention of the person performing the act (''finis operantis''), and the circumstances surrounding the action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4001">'''Retention and protention''' ({{lang-de|Retention und Protention}}) are key aspects of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[temporality]]. 

==Overview==
Our experience of the world is not of a series of unconnected moments. Indeed, it would be impossible to have an experience of the world if we did not have a sense of [[temporality]]. That our perception brings an impression to our minds depends upon retention and protention. 

'''Retention''' is the process whereby a phase of a perceptual act is retained in our consciousness. It is a presentation of that which is no longer before us and is distinct from immediate experience. A simple example might be that of watching a ball being thrown. We retain where the ball was in our minds to understand the momentum of the ball as we perceive it in the immediate present. Retention is not a representation or memory but a presentation of a temporally extended present. That is, a present that extends beyond the few short milliseconds that are registered in a moment of sense perception. 

'''Protention''' is our anticipation of the next moment. The moment that has yet to be perceived. Again, using the example of a ball, our focus shifts along the expected path the ball will take. 

According to Husserl, perception has three temporal aspects, retention, the immediate present and protention and a flow through which each moment of protention becomes the retention of the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Francisco| last=Varela| author-link=Francisco Varela | title=The Specious Present : A Neurophenomenology of Time Consciousness | publisher=Stanford University Press | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] describes the temporal phenomenology of perception in the [[Phenomenology of Perception]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Husserl uses the terms protentions and retentions for the intentionalities which anchor me to an environment. They do not run from a central I, but from my perceptual field itself, so to speak, which draws along in its wake its own horizon of retentions, and bites into the future with its protentions. I do not pass through a series of instances of now, the images of which I preserve and which, placed end to end, make a line. With the arrival of every moment, its predecessor undergoes a change: I still have it in hand and it is still there, but already it is sinking away below the level of presents; in order to retain it, I need to reach through a thin layer of time. It is still the preceding moment, and I have the power to rejoin it as it was just now; I am not cut off from it, but still it would not belong to the past unless something had altered, unless it were beginning to outline itself against, or project itself upon, my present, whereas a moment ago it was my present. When a third moment arrives, the second undergoes a new modification; from being a retention it becomes the retention of a retention, and the layer of time between it and me thickens."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Maurice| last=Merleau-Ponty| author-link=Maurice Merleau-Ponty | title=Phenomenology of Perception | publisher=Routledge | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interesting links with this theory come from current neuroscience which shows that present, past and future are always intertwined, also in memory. Accordingly, “memory is not only about the past, but is also about the future. Indeed, while memory serves as the ability to recall previous experiences, recall itself is not solely directed toward the past, but is guided by the present for the service of the future”.&lt;ref&gt;Ofengenden, Tzofit (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-03.pdf Memory formation and belief.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):34–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5796">'''Robert W. Funk''' (July 18, 1926 – September 3, 2005) was an American biblical scholar, founder of the [[Jesus Seminar]] and the nonprofit [[Westar Institute]] in [[Santa Rosa, California]]. Funk, an academic, sought to promote research and education on what he called biblical literacy. His approach to [[hermeneutics]] was [[historical-critical method|historical-critical]], with a strongly [[skepticism|skeptical]] view of orthodox Christian belief, particularly concerning the [[historical Jesus]].&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. "The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide". Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition). p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; He and his peers described Jesus' parables as containing shocking messages that contradicted established religious attitudes.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

==Academic==
Funk had a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] and [[Master's degree]] from [[Butler University]] and its affiliated [[Christian Theological Seminary]] in 1950 and 1951, a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1953 from [[Vanderbilt University]] and was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] and a Senior [[Fulbright Scholar]].

He taught at the [[American School of Oriental Research]] in Jerusalem, was chairman of the graduate department of religion at Vanderbilt University and executive secretary of the [[Society of Biblical Literature]]. He was founder and first executive director of Scholars Press (1974–1980).

Library of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Hebrew]]: '''שמריה בן אליהו האיקריטי''') was a [[Romaniote Jews|Greek-Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;Sackson, A. "Joseph ben Moses Qilti: Preliminary Study of a Greek-Jewish Philosopher", JQR 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher and [[Biblical exegete]], contemporary of [[Dante]] and [[Immanuel the Roman]].

==Life==
He was born probably at [[Rome]], the descendant of a long line of [[Roman Jews]]. His father, in his youth, went as rabbi to [[Crete]], whence his surname, "Ha-Yewani" (="the Greek"), or "Ha-Iḳriṭti" (= "the Cretan"). Shemariah had a critical mind, and knew [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latin language|Latin]], and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Up to 1305 he studied the [[Bible]] exclusively; then he took up [[Talmudic]] [[aggadah]] and philosophy. The earliest ''Tractatus'' version in Hebrew was translated by Shemariah and presented as his own work, titled ''Sefer ha-Hihhayon''.&lt;ref&gt; Gad Freudenthal (2011). Science in Medieval Jewish Cultures. Cambridge University Press. pp. 128–. {{ISBN|978-1-107-00145-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His reputation was such that he was called to the court of [[King Robert of Naples]] (who acted as his patron), where he devoted himself chiefly to Biblical studies and wrote commentaries on [[Tanakh|Scripture]]. By 1328 he had completed philosophic commentaries on the [[Pentateuch]] (especially the story of the Creation), the [[Book of Job]], and [[Canticles]]. He aimed at bringing about a union between [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]] and [[Rabbinites]]; the Karaites, in fact, recognized and honored him. Shemariah addressed an ''Epistle on the Creation of the World'' to Robert in 1328. Shemariah of Negroponte also dedicated a commentary on the [[Song of Songs]] to the King, comparing the latter to [[King Solomon]].&lt;ref&gt;Colette Sirat (30 November 1990). A History of Jewish Philosophy in the Middle Ages. Cambridge University Press. pp. 330–. {{ISBN|978-0-521-39727-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of a son (1330) interrupted his work for a time, but he soon took it up again. In 1346 he wrote his ''Sefer ha-Mora,'' a refutation of the philosophical views on the Creation. Believing that he had placed Rabbinism on a sure foundation, Shemariah undertook, in 1352, a journey to [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and [[Andalusia]], in order to convert the Karaites. He is said to have pretended to be the [[Jewish Messiah]], and was reviled to such an extent that the government arrested him. He died in prison. Like most of his contemporaries, he was scientifically an epigone of the great philosophers and exegetes. He also wrote ''Elef ha-Magen'' (a commentary on the [[aggadah]] in the treatise [[wikt:megillah|Megillah]]), some [[piyyuṭim]], and poems.

[[File:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.jpg|thumb|200px|The original cover of [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), in which he discusses the concept of the social contract theory]]

In both [[Moral philosophy|moral]] and [[political philosophy]], the '''social contract''' is a theory or model that originated during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and usually concerns the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the authority of the [[State (polity)|state]] over the [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;"For the name social contract (or original contract) often covers two different kinds of contract, and, in tracing the evolution of the theory, it is well to distinguish them. Both were current in the 17th century and both can be discovered in Greek political thought. ... [The first] generally involved some theory of the origin of the state. The second form of social contract may be more accurately called the contract of government, or the contract of submission....  Generally, it has nothing to do with the origins of society, but, presupposing a society already formed, it purports to define the terms on which that society is to be governed: the people have made a contract with their ruler which determines their relations with him. They promise him obedience, while he promises his protection and good government. While he keeps his part of the bargain, they must keep theirs, but if he misgoverns the contract is broken and allegiance is at an end." [[J. W. Gough]], ''The Social Contract'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1936), pp.{{nbsp}}2–3. Modern revivals of social contract theories have not been as concerned with the origin of the state.&lt;/ref&gt; Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented, either explicitly or [[tacit consent|tacitly]], to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler (or to the decision of a majority) in exchange for protection of their remaining [[rights]].

Therefore, the relation between [[natural and legal rights]] is often a topic of social contract theory. The term takes its name from ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (French: ''Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique''), a 1762 book by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] that discussed this concept.

Although the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity, in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy and [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Canon Law]], the heyday of the social contract was the mid-17th to early 19th centuries, when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy. The starting point for most social contract theories is an examination of the human condition absent of any political order that [[Thomas Hobbes]] termed the "[[state of nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ross Harrison writes that "Hobbes seems to have invented this useful term." See Ross Harrison, ''Locke, Hobbs, and Confusion's Masterpiece'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p.{{nbsp}}70. The phrase "state of nature" does occur, in  [[State of nature#History|Thomas Aquinas]]'s [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer19.htm ''Quaestiones disputatae de veritate'', Question 19, Article 1, Answer 13]. However, Aquinas uses it in the context of a discussion of the nature of the soul after death, not in reference to politics.&lt;/ref&gt; In this condition, individuals' actions are bound only by their personal [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[conscience]]. From this shared starting point, social contract theorists seek to demonstrate, in different ways, why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up their natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order.

Prominent of 17th- and 18th-century theorists of social contract and natural rights include [[Hugo Grotius]] (1625), [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651), [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] (1673), [[John Locke]] (1689), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1762), and [[Immanuel Kant]] (1797). Each solved the problem of political authority differently. Grotius posited that individual humans had [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. [[Thomas Hobbes]] famously said that in a "[[state of nature]]", human life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". In the absence of political order and law, everyone would have unlimited natural freedoms, including the "right to all things" and thus the freedom to plunder, rape, and murder; there would be an endless "war of all against all" (''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]''). To avoid this, free men contract with each other to establish political [[community]] ([[civil society]]) through a social contract in which they all gain security in return for subjecting themselves to an absolute sovereign, one man or an assembly of men. Though the sovereign's edicts may well be arbitrary and tyrannical, Hobbes saw absolute government as the only alternative to the terrifying anarchy of a state of nature. Hobbes asserted that humans consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government (whether monarchical or parliamentary). Pufendorf disputed Hobbes's equation of a state of nature with war.&lt;ref name="Patrick Riley 2006 pp. 347"&gt;Patrick Riley, ''The Social Contract and Its Critics'', chapter{{nbsp}}12 in ''The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Political Thought'', Eds. Mark Goldie and Robert Wokler, Vol{{nbsp}}4 of ''The Cambridge History of Political Thought'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp.{{nbsp}}347–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued that we gain civil rights in return for accepting the obligation to respect and defend the rights of others, giving up some freedoms to do so.

The central assertion that social contract approaches is that law and political order are not natural, but human creations. The social contract and the political order it creates are simply the means towards an end—the benefit of the individuals involved—and legitimate only to the extent that they fulfill their part of the agreement. Hobbes argued that government is not a party to the original contract and citizens are not obligated to submit to the government when it is too weak to act effectively to suppress factionalism and civil unrest. According to other social contract theorists, when the government fails to secure their natural rights (Locke) or satisfy the best interests of society (called the "[[general will]]" in Rousseau), citizens can withdraw their obligation to obey, or change the leadership through elections or other means including, when necessary, violence.

Locke believed that [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] were inalienable, and therefore the rule of God superseded government authority, while Rousseau believed that democracy (self-rule) was the best way to ensure welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law. The Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. Social contract theories were eclipsed in the 19th{{nbsp}}century in favor of [[utilitarianism]], [[Hegelianism]], and [[Marxism]], and were revived in the 20th{{nbsp}}century, notably in the form of a [[Original position|thought experiment]] by [[John Rawls]].&lt;ref name="Patrick Riley 2006 pp. 347"/&gt;

==History==
The concept of the social contract was originally posed by [[Glaucon]], as described by [[Plato]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Book{{nbsp}}II.

{{quote|They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice;—it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic, Book II. Quoted from http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.3.ii.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The social contract theory also appears in ''[[Crito]]'', another dialogue from Plato.  Over time, the social contract theory became more widespread after [[Epicurus]] (341-270 BC), the first philosopher who saw justice as a social contract, and not as existing in Nature due to divine intervention (see below and also [[Epicureanism#Ethics|Epicurean ethics]]), decided to bring the theory to the forefront of his society.  As time went on, philosophers of traditional political and social thought, such as Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau put forward their opinions on social contract, which then caused the topic to become much more mainstream.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Classical thought===
Social contract formulations are preserved in many of the world's oldest records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/enlightenment--33?print=1|title=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/enlightenment--33?print=1|website=www.timetoast.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist text of the second century BCE, [[Mahāvastu]], recounts the legend of Mahasammata. The story goes as follows:
{{quote|In the early days of the cosmic cycle mankind lived on an immaterial plane, dancing on air in a sort of fairyland, where there was no need of food or clothing, and no private property, family, government or laws. Then gradually the process of cosmic decay began its work, and mankind became earthbound, and felt the need of food and shelter. As men lost their primeval glory, distinctions of class arose, and they entered into agreements with one another, accepting the institution of private property and the family. With this theft, murder, adultery, and other crime began, and so the people met together and decided to appoint one man from among them to maintain order in return for a share of the produce of their fields and herds. He was called "the Great Chosen One" (Mahasammata), and he received the title of raja because he pleased the people.&lt;ref name="AL Basham pp 83"&gt;AL Basham, ''The Wonder That Was India'', pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his rock edicts, the Buddhist king [[Asoka]] was said to have argued for a broad and far-reaching social contract. The Buddhist ''vinaya'' also reflects social contracts expected of the monks; one such instance is when the people of a certain town complained about monks felling saka trees, the Buddha tells his monks that they must stop and give way to social norms.

[[Epicurus]] in the fourth century BCE seemed to have had a strong sense of social contract, with justice and law being rooted in mutual agreement and advantage, as evidenced by these lines, among others, from his ''Principal Doctrines'' (see also [[Epicureanism#Ethics|Epicurean ethics]]):

{{quote|31. Natural justice is a pledge of reciprocal benefit, to prevent one man from harming or being harmed by another.

32. Those animals which are incapable of making binding agreements with one another not to inflict nor suffer harm are without either justice or injustice; and likewise for those peoples who either could not or would not form binding agreements not to inflict nor suffer harm.

33. There never was such a thing as absolute justice, but only agreements made in mutual dealings among men in whatever places at various times providing against the infliction or suffering of harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vincent Cook |url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html |title=Principal Doctrines |publisher=Epicurus |date=2000-08-26 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Renaissance developments===
[[Quentin Skinner]] has argued that several critical modern innovations in contract theory are found in the writings from French Calvinists and Huguenots, whose work in turn was invoked by writers in the [[Low Countries]] who objected to their subjection to Spain and, later still, by Catholics in England.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Skinner, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought: Volume 2: The Age of the Reformation'' (Cambridge, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617), from the [[School of Salamanca]], might be considered an early theorist of the social contract, theorizing [[natural law]] in an attempt to limit the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]] of [[absolute monarchy]]. All of these groups were led to articulate notions of popular [[sovereignty]] by means of a social covenant or contract, and all of these arguments began with proto-"state of nature" arguments, to the effect that the basis of politics is that everyone is by nature free of subjection to any government.

These arguments, however, relied on a corporatist theory found in Roman law, according to which "a populus" can exist as a distinct legal entity. Thus, these arguments held that a group of people can join a government because it has the capacity to exercise a single will and make decisions with a single voice in the absence of sovereign authority—a notion rejected by Hobbes and later contract theorists.

==Philosophers==

===Hugo Grotius (1625)===
In the early 17th century, [[Grotius]] (1583–1645) introduced the modern idea that individuals had ''natural rights'' that enabled self-preservation, employing this idea as a basis for moral consensus in the face of religious diversity and the rise of natural science. He seeks to find a parsimonious basis for a moral beginning for society, a kind of [[natural law]] that everyone could accept. He goes so far as to say in his ''[[De jure belli ac pacis|On the Law of War and Peace]]'' that even if we were to concede what we cannot concede without the utmost wickedness, namely that there is no God, these laws would still hold.

The idea was considered incendiary since it suggested that power can ultimately go back to the individuals if the political society that they have set up forfeits the purpose for which it was originally established, which is to preserve themselves. In other words, individual persons are sovereign. Grotius says that the people are ''sui juris'' (under their own jurisdiction). People have rights as human beings, but there is a delineation of those rights because of what is possible for everyone to accept morally; everyone has to accept that each person as an individual is entitled to try to preserve himself. Each person should, therefore, avoid doing harm to, or interfering with, another, and any breach of these rights should be punished.

===Thomas Hobbes' ''Leviathan'' (1651)===
{{main|Leviathan (Hobbes book)}}

The first modern philosopher to articulate a detailed contract theory was [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679). According to Hobbes, the lives of individuals in the [[state of nature]] were "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short", a state in which self-interest and the absence of rights and contracts prevented the "social", or society. Life was "anarchic" (without leadership or the concept of sovereignty). Individuals in the state of nature were apolitical and asocial. This state of nature is followed by the social contract.

The social contract was an "occurrence" during which individuals came together and ceded some of their [[natural rights|individual rights]] so that others would cede theirs.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. person{{nbsp}}A gives up his/her right to kill person{{nbsp}}B if person{{nbsp}}B does the same.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the establishment of the state, a sovereign entity like the individuals now under its rule used to be, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Human life was thus no longer "a war of all against all".

The state system, which grew out of the social contract, was, however, also anarchic (without leadership). Just as the individuals in the state of nature had been sovereigns and thus guided by self-interest and the absence of rights, so states now acted in their self-interest in competition with each other. Just like the state of nature, states were thus bound to be in conflict because there was no sovereign over and above the state (more powerful) capable of imposing some system such as social-contract laws on everyone by force. Indeed, Hobbes' work helped to serve as a basis for the [[Political realism|realism]] theories of international relations, advanced by [[E. H. Carr]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]]. Hobbes wrote in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' that humans ("we") need the "terrour of some Power" otherwise humans will not heed the [[Golden Rule|law of reciprocity]], "(in summe) doing to others, as wee would be done to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|title=Leviathan|date=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=London|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Locke's ''Second Treatise of Government'' (1689)===
[[John Locke]]'s conception of the social contract differed from Hobbes' in several fundamental ways, retaining only the central notion that persons in a state of nature would willingly come together to form a state. Locke believed that individuals in a state of nature would be bound morally, by the Law of Nature, not to harm each other in their lives or possessions. Without government to defend them against those seeking to injure or enslave them, Locke further believed people would have no security in their rights and would live in fear. Individuals, to Locke, would only agree to form a state that would provide, in part, a "neutral judge", acting to protect the lives, liberty, and property of those who lived within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaba|first=Jeffery|date=Spring 2007|title=John Locke and the Meaning of the Takings Clause|url=https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3727&amp;context=mlr|journal=Missouri Law Review|volume=72|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hobbes argued for near-absolute authority, Locke argued for inviolate freedom under law in his [[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|''Second Treatise of Government'']]. Locke argued that a government's legitimacy comes from the citizens' delegation to the government of their absolute right of violence (reserving the inalienable right of self-defense or "self-preservation"), along with elements of other rights (e.g. property will be liable to taxation) as necessary to achieve the goal of security through granting the state a monopoly of violence, whereby the government, as an impartial judge, may use the collective force of the populace to administer and enforce the law, rather than each man acting as his own judge, jury, and executioner—the condition in the state of nature.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ''Du contrat social'' (1762)===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778), in his influential 1762 treatise ''[[The Social Contract]]'', outlined a different version of social contract theory, as the foundations of [[political rights]] based on unlimited [[popular sovereignty]]. Although Rousseau wrote that the British were perhaps at the time the freest people on earth, he did not approve of their [[representative government]]. Rousseau believed that liberty was possible only where there was direct rule by the people as a whole in lawmaking, where popular sovereignty was indivisible and [[inalienable right|inalienable]]. But he also maintained that the people often did not know their "real will", and that a proper society would not occur until a great leader ("the Legislator") arose to change the values and customs of the people, likely through the strategic use of religion.

Rousseau's political theory differs in important ways from that of Locke and Hobbes. Rousseau's collectivism is most evident in his development of the "luminous conception" (which he credited to [[Denis Diderot]]) of the [[general will]]. Rousseau argues a citizen cannot pursue his true interest by being an [[Ethical egoism|egoist]] but must instead subordinate himself to the law created by the citizenry acting as a collective.

{{quote|[The social contract] can be reduced to the following terms: ''Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will; and in a body we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole.''&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''Oeuvres complètes'', ed.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Gagnebin and M.&amp;nbsp;Raymond (Paris, 1959–95), III, 361; ''The Collected Writings of Rousseau'', ed.&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Kelley and R.&amp;nbsp;Masters (Hanover, 1990–), IV, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rousseau's striking phrase that man must "be forced to be free"&lt;ref&gt;''Oeuvres complètes'', III, 364; ''The Collected Writings of Rousseau'', IV, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; should be understood this way: since the indivisible and inalienable popular sovereignty decides what is good for the whole, then if an individual lapses back into his ordinary egoism and disobeys the law, he will be forced to listen to what was decided when the people acted as a collectivity (as [[citizen]]s). Thus, the law, inasmuch as it is created by the people acting as a body, is not a limitation of individual freedom, but rather its expression.

Thus, enforcement of laws, including [[criminal law]], is not a restriction on individual liberty: the individual, as a citizen, explicitly agreed to be constrained if, as a private individual, he did not respect his own will as formulated in the general will. Because laws represent the restraints of civil freedom, they represent the leap made from humans in the state of nature into civil society. In this sense, the law is a civilizing force, and therefore Rousseau believed that the laws that govern a people helped to mold their character.

===Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's individualist social contract (1851)===
While Rousseau's social contract is based on [[popular sovereignty]] and not on individual sovereignty, there are other theories espoused by [[individualist]]s, [[libertarians]], and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] that do not involve agreeing to anything more than [[Negative and positive rights|negative rights]] and creates only a limited state, if any.

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) advocated a conception of social contract that did not involve an individual surrendering sovereignty to others. According to him, the social contract was not between individuals and the state, but rather among individuals who refrain from coercing or governing each other, each one maintaining complete sovereignty upon him- or herself:

{{quote|What really is the Social Contract? An agreement of the citizen with the government? No, that would mean but the continuation of [Rousseau's] idea. The social contract is an agreement of man with man; an agreement from which must result what we call society. In this, the notion of commutative justice, first brought forward by the primitive fact of exchange, ... is substituted for that of distributive justice ... Translating these words, contract, commutative justice, which are the language of the law, into the language of business, and you have commerce, that is to say, in its highest significance, the act by which man and man declare themselves essentially producers, and abdicate all pretension to govern each other.|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|''[[The General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century|General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1851)}}

===John Rawls' ''Theory of Justice'' (1971)===
Building on the work of Immanuel Kant with its presumption of limits on the state,&lt;ref&gt;• Gerald Gaus and Shane D. Courtland, 2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/  "Liberalism"], 1.1, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Immanuel Kant, ([1797]). ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', Part{{nbsp}}1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rawls]] (1921–2002), in ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), proposed a contractarian approach whereby rational people in a hypothetical "[[original position]]" would set aside their individual preferences and capacities under a "[[veil of ignorance]]" and agree to certain general principles of justice and legal organization. This idea is also used as a [[game theory|game-theoretical]] formalization of the notion of fairness.

===David Gauthier's ''Morals By Agreement'' (1986)===
{{Main|Contractarian ethics}}
[[David Gauthier]] "neo-Hobbesian" theory argues that cooperation between two independent and self-interested parties is indeed possible, especially when it comes to understanding morality and politics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/#SH3b |title=Social Contract Theory [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=2004-10-15 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauthier notably points out the advantages of cooperation between two parties when it comes to the challenge of the [[prisoner's dilemma]]. He proposes that, if two parties were to stick to the original agreed-upon arrangement and morals outlined by the contract, they would both experience an optimal result.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/#3 |title=Contractarianism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model for the social contract, factors including trust, rationality, and self-interest keep each party honest and dissuade them from breaking the rules.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

===Philip Pettit's ''Republicanism'' (1997)===
[[Philip Pettit]] (b. 1945) has argued, in ''Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government'' (1997), that the theory of social contract, classically based on the [[consent of the governed]], should be modified. Instead of arguing for explicit consent, which can always be [[Manufacturing Consent|manufactured]], Pettit argues that the absence of an effective rebellion against it is a contract's only legitimacy.

==Critical theories==

===Consent of the governed===
An early critic of social contract theory was [[Rousseau]]'s friend, the philosopher [[David Hume]], who in 1742 published an essay "Of Civil Liberty". The second part of this essay, entitled "Of the Original Contract",&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;{{cite book|url= |author=Hume, David|title= Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay XII, Of The Original Contract|publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stresses that the concept of a "social contract" is a convenient fiction: {{quote|As no party, in the present age can well support itself without a philosophical or speculative system of principles annexed to its political or practical one; we accordingly find that each of the factions into which this nation is divided has reared up a fabric of the former kind, in order to protect and cover that scheme of actions which it pursues. ... The one party [defenders of the absolute and divine right of kings, or Tories], by tracing up government to the DEITY, endeavor to render it so sacred and inviolate that it must be little less than sacrilege, however tyrannical it may become, to touch or invade it in the smallest article. The other party [the Whigs, or believers in constitutional monarchy], by founding government altogether on the consent of the PEOPLE suppose that there is a kind of original contract by which the subjects have tacitly reserved the power of resisting their sovereign, whenever they find themselves aggrieved by that authority with which they have for certain purposes voluntarily entrusted him. |David Hume, "On Civil Liberty" [II.XII.1]&lt;ref name="Hume"/&gt;}}

Hume argued that [[consent of the governed]] was the ideal foundation on which a government should rest, but that it had not actually occurred this way in general. {{quote|My intention here is not to exclude the consent of the people from being one just foundation of government where it has place. It is surely the best and most sacred of any. I only contend that it has very seldom had place in any degree and never almost in its full extent. And that therefore some other foundation of government must also be admitted. |Ibid II.XII.20}}

===Natural law and constitutionalism===
Legal scholar [[Randy Barnett]] has argued&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.randybarnett.com/ Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty]'', Randy Barnett (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; that, while presence in the territory of a society may be necessary for consent, this does not constitute consent to ''all'' rules the society might make regardless of their content. A second condition of consent is that the rules be consistent with underlying principles of justice and the protection of natural and social rights, and have procedures for effective protection of those rights (or liberties). This has also been discussed by O.{{nbsp}}A. Brownson,&lt;ref name="brownson"/&gt; who argued that, in a sense, three "constitutions" are involved: first, the ''constitution of nature'' that includes all of what the Founders called "[[natural law]]"; second, the ''constitution of society'', an unwritten and commonly understood set of rules for the society formed by a social contract before it establishes a government, by which it does establish the third, a ''constitution of government''. To consent, a necessary condition is that the rules be ''[[constitution]]al'' in that sense.

===Tacit consent===
The theory of an implicit social contract holds that by remaining in the territory controlled by some society, which usually has a government, people give consent to join that society and be governed by its government, if any. This consent is what gives legitimacy to such a government.

Other writers have argued that consent to join the society is not necessarily consent to its government. For that, the government must be set up according to a constitution of government that is consistent with the superior unwritten constitutions of nature and society.&lt;ref name="brownson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitution.org/oab/am_rep.htm |author=O. A. Brownson |title=''The American Republic: its Constitution, Tendencies, and Destiny'' |year=1866 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Explicit Consent ===
The theory of an implicit social contract also goes under the principles of explicit consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/gaining-explicit-consent-under-the-gdpr-2/|title=Gaining explicit consent under the GDPR|date=2017-07-05|work=IT Governance Blog|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main difference between Tacit consent and explicit consent is that explicit consent is meant to leave no room for misinterpretation.  Moreover, you should directly state what it is that you want and the person has to respond in a concise manner that either confirms or denies the proposition.

===Voluntarism===
According to the will theory of contract, a contract is not presumed valid unless all parties voluntarily agree to it, either tacitly or explicitly, without coercion. [[Lysander Spooner]], a 19th-century lawyer and staunch supporter of a right of contract between individuals, argued in his essay ''[[No Treason]]'' that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract. As a result, he maintains that such an agreement is not voluntary and therefore cannot be considered a legitimate contract at all.

Modern Anglo-American law, like European civil law, is based on a will theory of contract, according to which all terms of a contract are binding on the parties because they chose those terms for themselves. This was less true when Hobbes wrote ''Leviathan''; at that time more importance was attached to consideration, meaning a mutual exchange of benefits necessary to the formation of a valid contract, and most contracts had implicit terms that arose from the nature of the contractual relationship rather than from the choices made by the parties. Accordingly, it has been argued that social contract theory is more consistent with the contract law of the time of Hobbes and Locke than with the contract law of our time, and that certain features in the social contract which seem anomalous to us, such as the belief that we are bound by a contract formulated by our distant ancestors, would not have seemed as strange to Hobbes' contemporaries as they do to us.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kary, "Contract Law and the Social Contract: What Legal History Can Teach Us About the Political Theory of Hobbes and Locke", 31 Ottawa Law Review 73 (Jan. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Introduction ===
The Society was registered in 1951 by Dr Francis C. Roles, four years after the death of his teacher, the Russian philosopher [[P. D. Ouspensky]], who had settled in England in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Gary|title=In Search of P. D. Ouspensky|year=2006|publisher=Quest Books|isbn=978-0-8356-0848-0|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society was set up to continue Ouspensky's work as a "School of the Fourth Way".&lt;ref name="bridge14"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Eadie|first = Peter McGregor|journal = The Bridge|year = 2001|volume = 14|page = 27|publisher = The Study Society|title = The Odyssey of Francis C. Roles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=school&gt;{{cite book|last=Ouspensky|first=P. D.|title=The Psychology of Man′s Possible Evolution|year=1974|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-394-71943-3}} Originally published in 1940. Chapter: Lecture held Thursday, 23 September 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fourth Way ===
The Fourth Way is a concept used by [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]] to describe an approach to self-development learned over years of travel in the East that combined what he saw as three established traditional "ways," or "schools" into a fourth way. These three ways were of the body, mind and emotions.  According to his principles and instructions, Gurdjieff's method for awakening one's consciousness is different from that of the fakir, monk or yogi, so his discipline is also called the ‘[[Fourth Way]]’.&lt;ref name=school /&gt; His pupil [[P.D. Ouspensky]] from 1924 to 1947 made the term and its use central to his own teaching of Gurdjieff's ideas, and after Ouspensky's death, his students published a book titled ''The Fourth Way''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ouspensky|first=P. D.|title=The Fourth Way|date=1971|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-394-71672-8}} Originally published in 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;  based on his lectures.

[[P. D. Ouspensky]] had developed his system of Self-discovery from the fundamental idea that ordinary human consciousness is incomplete and that it is possible for it to evolve further by personal effort and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ouspensky|first=P. D.|title=The Psychology of Man′s Possible Evolution|year=1974|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-394-71943-3}} Originally published in 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, this approach has generally been confined to closed orders, religious or otherwise and directed to the development of one particular human faculty: intellectual, emotional or physical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ouspensky|first=P. D.|title=In Search of the Miraculous|year=1950|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd|isbn=0-7100-1910-6}} Chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ouspensky promoted the practice of a ‘[[Fourth Way]]’, whereby ordinary people, remaining engaged in life, could work on all three aspects simultaneously. His teaching asserts the unity of the individual with the whole cosmos in both structure and potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ouspensky|first=P. D.|title=In Search of the Miraculous|year=1950|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd|isbn=0-7100-1910-6|pages=205–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, Ouspensky had learned a system of knowledge and certain practical methods from [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]] and until his death in 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Gary|title=In Search of P. D. Ouspensky|year=2006|publisher=Quest Books|isbn=978-0-8356-0848-0|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ouspensky devoted his life to further developing this system in the light of his own ideas. He established large groups of pupils in London and New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Gary|title=In Search of P. D. Ouspensky|year=2006|publisher=Quest Books|isbn=978-0-8356-0848-0|pages=178, 248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ouspensky’s London headquarters before and following World War II were at Colet House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Gary|title=In Search of P.D. Ouspensky|year=2006|publisher=Quest Books|isbn=978-0-8356-0848-0|pages=230, 262}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work led him to the conviction that the system was essentially incomplete; in particular it lacked a simple method to allow the ideas to develop naturally into behaviour and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Company II|year=2009|publisher=The Study Society|isbn=978-0-9547939-9-9|page=9}}Extract of audiences with Shantanand Saraswati.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ouspensky Today: chronology 1941-1947|url=http://www.ouspenskytoday.org/wp/chronology/1941-1947-usa-england/|publisher=Ouspensky Today|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ‘The Movements’ ===
The [[Gurdjieff movements|Movements]] were introduced into this country by Mme Ouspensky in the 1930s, when they were taught to [[P. D. Ouspensky|Ouspensky’s]] pupils at Lyne Place, Virginia Water and at Colet House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howarth|first=Jessmin|title=Remember Inner Work|url=http://www.gurdjieff.org/howarth1.htm|publisher=Gurdjieff International Review Spring 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gurdjieff movements|Movements]] were originally called Sacred Dances, Prayers and Exercises, and were known only in certain monasteries, temples, closed communities and esoteric orders scattered throughout the Middle East, the Hindu Kush and Tibet. During his travels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]] learned these sacred dances and their original music at their diverse sources and brought them together into a single repertoire which he then taught to his students in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howarth|first=Jessmin &amp; Dushka|title=It’s Up To Ourselves|year=2009|publisher=Gurdjieff Heritage Society|isbn=978-0-9791926-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mistlberger|first=P. T.|title=The Three Dangerous Magi|year=2010|publisher=O Books|isbn=978-1-84694-435-2|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meditation ===
Dr Roles continued with Ouspensky’s teaching for 13 years but in 1960, as a result of Ouspensky’s instruction to search for ‘the source of the system’, he came to meet [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] in London. He recognised the method of mantra [[meditation]] that the Maharishi was disseminating as the simple method that Ouspensky had told him to find.&lt;ref name=bridge14 /&gt; The Study Society was instrumental in setting up the Maharishi’s seminal lecture to 5000 people at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collin-Smith|first=Joyce|title=Call No Man Master|year=1988|publisher=Gateway Books|location=Bath, UK|isbn=0-946551-46-4|pages=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meditation&gt;{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Paul|title=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi - The Biography of the Man who gave Transcendental Meditation to the World|year=1994|isbn=978-1-85230-571-0}} Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; which greatly raised his profile in Europe. Meditation was the inspiration of a group of Indian sages the most prominent of whom was Swami [[Brahmananda Saraswati]], Guru Deva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roles|first=Francis|title=A Lasting Freedom|year=1972|publisher=The Society for the Study of Normal Psychology|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was not until Dr Roles was introduced to Swami Shantanand Saraswati, [[Shankaracharya]] of [[Jyotirmath]]—the head of the Advaita tradition in Northern India whose teaching of the non-dual philosophy of the Vedanta complemented and completed all he had learnt before—that he became convinced that his search was over.&lt;ref name="Good Company II"&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Company II|year=2009|publisher=The Study Society|isbn=978-0-9547939-9-9|page=10}} Extract of audiences with Shantanand Saraswati.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Company|year=1987|publisher=The Society for the Study of Normal Psychology|isbn=978-0-9561442-1-8|page=9}} Extract of audiences with Shantanand Saraswati.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ouspensky Today: chronology 1960-1982|url=http://www.ouspenskytoday.org/wp/chronology/1960-1982-dr-f-c-roles-source-of-the-system/|publisher=Ouspensky Today|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mevlevi Turning of the Whirling Dervishes ===
In 1963 the Society formed a connection with Resuhi Baykara, a leader of the [[Rumi|Mevlevi]] Tradition in Istanbul who trained members of the Society in the discipline of [[Sufi whirling|Sufi Whirling Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Koren|first = Wilhelm|journal = The Bridge|year = 1997|volume = 12|page = 202|publisher = The Study Society|title = The Mevlevi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Sufism|Sufi]] discipline, originated by the 13th century mystic [[Rumi|Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī]] is said to provide a means of acquiring inner stillness. The ceremony of the [[Sama (Sufism)|sema, or Mukabele]] takes place regularly at Colet House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whirling Dervishes|url=http://www.studysociety.org/turning.html|publisher=The Study Society|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conclusion ===
Dr Francis C. Roles died in 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Dr F.C. Roles|journal=British Medical Journal|date=July 1982|volume=285|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1499089/pdf/bmjcred00614-0067.pdf|page=67|pmc=1499089}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Shantanand Saraswati in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, The Hindhu Times, Sunday December 7, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trialism''' in [[philosophy]] was introduced by [[John Cottingham]] as an alternative interpretation of the [[mind–body dualism]] of Rene [[Descartes]].  Trialism keeps the two substances of mind and body, but introduces a third attribute, sensation, belonging to the union of mind and body.  This allows animals, which do not have thought, to be regarded as having sensation and not as being mere [[automata]].

Christian trialism is the doctrine that humans have three separate essences (body, soul, spirit), based on a literal interpretation of [[1 Thessalonians]] 5:23 ''And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.'' This doctrine holds the [[soul]] to belong to the union of the body and the spirit, which makes it roughly compatible with philosophical trialism.  However, the [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Kenneth Copeland]] came under fire by critics such as [[Hank Hanegraff]] for extending trialism to each Person in the [[Trinity]], for a total of nine essences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4031">'''Wilfrid Augustine Hodges''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 27 May 1941) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]], known for his work in [[model theory]].

==Life==
Hodges was Professor of Mathematics at [[Queen Mary, University of London]] from 1987 to 2006, and is the author of books on [[logic]].

He attended [[New College, Oxford]] (1959–65), where he received degrees in both ''[[Literae Humaniores]]'' and (Christianic) [[Theology]]. In 1970 he was awarded a doctorate for a thesis in [[Logic]]. He lectured in both [[Philosophy]] and [[Mathematics]] at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College, University of London]]. He has held visiting appointments in the department of philosophy at the [[University of California]] and in the department of mathematics at [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]].

==Honors and awards==
Hodges was President of the [[British Logic Colloquium]], of the European [[Association for Logic, Language and Information]] and of the [[Division of Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science]].

In 2009 he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]].

==Writing style==
Wilfrid Hodges' books are written in an informal style. The "Notes on Notation" in his book "Model theory" end with the following characteristic sentence:

:'I' means I, 'we' means we.

When this 780-page book appeared in 1993, it became one of the standard textbooks on [[model theory]]. Due to its success an abbreviated version (but with a new chapter on [[stability theory (model theory)|stability theory]]) was published as a paperback.
