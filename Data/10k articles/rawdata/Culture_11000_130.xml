'''1636: The Kremlin Games''' is a novel in the [[1632 series]] written by [[Gorg Huff]] and [[Paula Goodlett]] along with [[Eric Flint]]. It is the fourth book in the series to be listed on the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]] for hardcover fiction. This book reached number 30 on the NY Times list during a single week in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-06-24/hardcover-fiction/list.html |title=Hardcover Fiction |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=24 June 2012 |access-date=March 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307010220/http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-06-24/hardcover-fiction/list.html |archive-date=March 7, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being listed on the NY Times Best Seller list, 1636: The Kremlin Games was also listed on the [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] Hardcovers Bestsellers List for the month of September in 2012 at number 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.locusmag.com/Magazine/2012/09/locus-bestsellers-september/ |title=Locus Bestsellers, September 2012 |magazine=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story follows Bernie Zeppi, an  auto mechanic from Grantville, as he travels East to [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] and helps to set in motion various chains of events that leads to fundamental reordering of Russian history and a massive shift from a primarily agrarian economy to a more industrialized one. In writing the review for ''1636: The Kremlin Game'', the reviewer for the ''SFRevu'' wrote a positive review stating that the book "is another side story in the ongoing Grantville saga" and that the "action is carried on by characters that haven't played a significant role in earlier parts of the series" and the book "allowed fans to get involved in the development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sfrevu.com/php/Review-id.php?id=13260 |title=1636: The Kremlin Games (Ring of Fire) by Eric Flint, Gorg Huff, and Paula Goodlett |website=SFRevu |date=June 5, 2012 |first=Bill |last=Lawhorn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for the ''San Francisco Book Review'' wrote that this book "is a standout even in a wonderful series" and it has "war, political intrigue, romance, [and] even car chases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://citybookreview.com/1636-the-kremlin-games-ring-of-fire/ |title=1636: The Kremlin Games |magazine=San Francisco Book Review |date=June 5, 2012 |first=Beth |last=Revers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Midwest Book Review]] said that this installment "is an enjoyable thriller with a wonderful second order effect on Bernie and the Russians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.midwestbookreview.com/mbw/aug_12.htm |title=MBR Bookwatch |website=[[Midwest Book Review]] |volume=11 |number=8 |date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Million Little Pieces''''' is a book by [[James Frey]], originally sold as a [[memoir]] and later marketed as a [[semi-fiction]]al novel following accusations of [[literary forgery]].&lt;ref&gt;Frey admitted in interviews that he had embellished central details of his purported incarceration for "obvious dramatic reasons". [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/million-little-lies The Man Who Conned Oprah]&lt;/ref&gt; It tells the story of a 23-year-old alcoholic and drug abuser and how he copes with rehabilitation in a [[Twelve-step program|twelve steps]]-oriented treatment center. While initially promoted as a memoir, it was later discovered that many of the events described in the book never happened.

==Summary==

A badly tattered James awakens on an airplane to Chicago, with no recollection of his injuries or of how he ended up on the plane. He is met by his parents at the airport, who take him to a rehabilitation clinic.  We find out that James is 23 years old, and has been an alcoholic for ten years, and a crack addict for three.  He is also wanted by the police in three different states on several charges.

As he checks into the rehab clinic, he is forced to quit his substance abuse, a transition that we find out later probably saves his life, but is also an incredibly agonizing event.  As part of this, he is forced to undergo a series of painful [[root canal]]s, without any [[anesthesia]] because of possible negative reactions to the drugs.  He copes with the pain by squeezing tennis balls until his nails crack (when challenged on this specific incident during his second ''Oprah'' appearance, Frey said that it ''may'' have been "more than one" root canal procedure and may or may not have included [[Novocaine]], as he remembers it).

The book follows Frey through the painful experiences that lead up to his eventual release from the center, including his participation in the clinic's family program with his parents, despite his strong desire not to.  Throughout the novel, Frey speaks of the "Fury" he is fighting, which he sees as the cause of his desire to drink alcohol and use drugs.  The "Fury" could be seen as the antagonist of the novel, because he believes that he will not be able to recover until he learns to ignore it or "kill it".

Frey meets many interesting people in the clinic, with whom he forms relationships and who play an important role in his life both during and after his time in the clinic.  These people include a [[mafia boss]] who plays a vital role in his recovery (subject of Frey's subsequent book ''[[My Friend Leonard]]''), and a woman drug addict with whom he falls in love, despite strict rules forbidding contact between men and women at the clinic. James finally recovers and never relapses.

A notable feature of ''Pieces'' is its lack of [[quotation marks]] to indicate direct quotes or dialogue. Instead, a new line is started each time someone speaks. The fact that the author uses this same style to indicate his internal thoughts, often interspersed between direct dialogue from himself and others, gives the book a unique and sometimes confusing writing style, purportedly reflecting the nature of his experience in the treatment center.  Frey makes frequent use of this [[stream of consciousness writing]] technique, which is intended to allow the reader to better understand his version of the events.  Frey's unique writing style also involves his capitalizing nouns throughout the book for unclear reasons. Frey also uses heavy repetition of words throughout the text.

==Reception==
The book was released on April 15, 2003, by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday Books]], a division of [[Random House]], and received mixed feedback. While some critics, such as [[Pat Conroy]],&lt;ref&gt;Conroy is quoted in an article by David Kamp titled "Step 13: Write a Book" published in ''Vanity Fair''&lt;/ref&gt; praised the book, calling it "the ''[[War and Peace]]'' of addiction", others were not as impressed by the gruesome nature of the book and Frey's overall attitude that sets the tone for the book. For example, critic Julian Keeling,&lt;ref&gt;Keeling's article in the New Statesman [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/145539 ''The yellow gloom of sleepless nights''] is a review of Frey's work and the similarities of his own experiences&lt;/ref&gt; a recovering addict, stated that "Frey's stylistic tactics are irritating...none of this makes the reader feel well-disposed towards him". Also, author Heather King said that "''A Million Little Pieces'' rings false".&lt;ref&gt;Heather King is the author of the memoir ''Parched'' and wrote the article in Publisher's Weekly [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/columns-and-blogs/soapbox/article/6642-why-james-frey-doesn-t-get-it-.html ''Why James Frey Doesn't Get It''], which tears down Frey's work and intention&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet and author [[John Dolan (writer)|John Dolan]] roundly criticized the book, saying:
:''Frey sums up his entire life in one sentence from p. 351 of this 382-page memoir: "I took money from my parents and I spent it on drugs." Given the simplicity and familiarity of the story, you might wonder what Frey does in the other 381 pages. The story itself is simple: he goes through rehab at an expensive private clinic, with his parents footing the bill. That's it. 400 pages of hanging around a rehab clinic.''

He was also scathing about the writing style, which he described as a "childish impersonation of the laconic Hemingway style", and referred to it as a "novel" several times.&lt;ref name=dolan&gt;Dolan, John  [http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=6948&amp;I6BLOCK_ID=35 "A Million Pieces Of Shit"], ''The Exile'', May 29, 2003, accessed December 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, the book was picked as an [[Oprah's Book Club]] selection, and shortly thereafter became the number one paperback non-fiction book on [[Amazon.com]], and topped the [[New York Times bestseller|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for fifteen straight weeks. By January 28, 2006, it had fallen to number four on the Amazon.com list with Winfrey's following selection, ''[[Night (book)|Night]]'' by [[Elie Wiesel]], taking over the top position.

The book garnered international attention in January 2006 after it was reported that it contained fabrications and was not, as originally represented by the author and publisher, a completely factual memoir.&lt;ref name="conned"/&gt;

In October 2017, it was announced that director [[Sam Taylor-Johnson]] and actor [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] were working on a film adaptation of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/sam-aaron-taylor-johnson-million-little-pieces-1202597903/|title=Sam Taylor-Johnson and Aaron Taylor-Johnson Team on ‘Million Little Pieces’|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=October 24, 2017|work=Variety|accessdate=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
After a six-week investigation, ''[[The Smoking Gun]]'' published an article on January 8, 2006, called "A Million Little Lies".  The article described fabrications in Frey's account of his drug abuse experiences, life, and criminal record.&lt;ref name="conned"&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/million-little-lies The Man Who Conned Oprah]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[CNN]], ''The Smoking Gun'''s editor, [[William Bastone]], said "the probe was prompted after the Oprah show aired".  He further stated, "We initially set off to just find a mug shot of him... It basically set off a chain of events that started with us having a difficult time finding a booking photo of this guy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/books/01/11/frey.lkl/index.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com - Winfrey stands behind 'Pieces' author - Jan 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minneapolis ''[[Star Tribune]]'' had questioned James Frey's claims as early as 2003. Frey responded, then, by saying, "I've never denied I've altered small details."

Stories surfaced about [[Random House]], publisher of ''A Million Little Pieces'', deciding to give full refunds to anyone who had purchased the book directly through it. According to a [[Gawker.com]] report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gawker.com/news/james-frey/james-frey-settlement-website-imminent-245978.php James Frey Settlement Website Imminent] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625023344/http://gawker.com/news/james-frey/james-frey-settlement-website-imminent-245978.php |date=June 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; customers could have a claim to money if they truly felt deceived by Frey.

In an article detailing the book, Frey is quoted saying he "stands by the book as being the essential truth of my life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2134203/ Picking Up the Pieces - How James Frey flunked rehab, and why his fakery matters.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, on January 26, 2006, Frey once again appeared  on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and this time admitted that the same "Demons" that had made him turn to alcohol and drugs had also driven him to fabricate crucial portions of his "memoir"; it first having been shopped as being a novel but declined by many, including Random House itself. Winfrey told Frey that she felt "really duped" but that, "more importantly, I feel that you betrayed millions of readers." She also apologized for her previous telephoned statement to ''[[Larry King Live]]'' — during Frey's appearance on that show on January 11, 2006 — that what mattered was not the truth of Frey's book, but its value as a therapeutic tool for addicts. She said, "I left the impression that the truth is not important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2006-01-25-frey-oprah_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Carol | last1=Memmott | title=Oprah grills Frey | date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the show, Winfrey interrogated Frey about everything from the number of root canals he had to the existence of his girlfriend, Lilly.  Winfrey then brought out Frey's publisher, [[Nan Talese]], to defend her decision to classify the book as a memoir, and forced Talese to admit that she had done nothing to check the book's veracity, despite the fact that her representatives had assured Winfrey's staff that the book was indeed non-fiction and described it as "brutally honest" in a press release.

[[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] of the ''New York Times'' wrote, "Both Mr. Frey and Ms. Talese were snapped in two like dry winter twigs."&lt;ref name="truthiness"&gt;{{cite news | last =Carr | first =David | coauthors = | title =How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =''The New York Times'' | date =January 30, 2006 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html?ex=1296277200&amp;en=1c0e8843da5b43d6&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | accessdate =2007-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Oprah annihilates Frey", proclaimed Larry King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/01/lkl.01.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'' columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] wrote, "It was a huge relief, after our long national slide into untruth and no consequences, into [[Swift boating|swiftboating]] and swift bucks, into [[George W.

All of Winfrey's reactions, as well as video clips of her interview with Frey, are found within her book club's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/200601/tows_past_20060126.jhtml James Frey and the "A Million Little Pieces" Controversy]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2006, [[Steven Levitt]], co-author of the book ''[[Freakonomics]]'', stated in his blog that, having searched the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] database of mortality detail records, he was unable to identify a single death that reasonably closely matched Frey's description of the circumstances of the death of "Lilly", Frey's alleged girlfriend in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/01/13/further-fact-checking-of-james-freys-memoirs/ | work=The New York Times | title=Further fact-checking of James Frey's memoirs | date=January 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Frey's admission to Winfrey that he had altered Lilly's method of suicide in the book from cutting her wrists to hanging, on January 27, 2006, Levitt recorded on his blog that he was again unable to find a recorded death consistent with Frey's revised description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/01/27/one-last-post-on-james-frey/ | work=The New York Times | title=One last post on James Frey | first=Steven D. | last=Levitt | date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Levitt states,
:"Frey’s primary defense has been to say that his criminal history is a minor part of the book and these inconsistencies do not substantively change the meaning of the story. Of course, his criminal history is the only thing that thesmokinggun.com actually looked into. Given that virtually nothing checked out, it doesn’t bode well for the veracity of the rest of the book."

==Reactions to controversy==
The publishers of the book, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and Anchor Books, initially stood by Frey, but further examination of the evidence eventually caused the publishers to alter their stances. They released a statement noting, "When the Smoking Gun report appeared, our first response, given that we were still learning the facts of the matter, was to support our author. Since then, we have questioned him about the allegations and have sadly come to the realization that a number of facts have been altered and incidents embellished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0601/27/ltm.01.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the publishers decided to include a publisher's note and an author's note from Frey as disclaimers to be included in future publications. According to the source at the company, there had been some disagreement among editors at the publishing house about Mr. Frey’s authenticity, but the early dissenters had been silenced by the book's commercial success, both pre- and post-Oprah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.observer.com/2006/01/the-awful-untruth-4/|title= The Awful Untruth - New York Observer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416084726/http://www.observer.com/20060123/20060123_Sheelah_Kolhatkar_pageone_coverstory2.asp |archivedate=April 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Random House issued a statement regarding the controversy. It noted that future editions of the book would contain notes from both the publisher and Frey on the text, as well as prominent notations on the cover and on their website about the additions. On September 12, 2006, Frey and publisher Random House, Inc. reached a tentative legal settlement, where readers who felt that they had been defrauded by Frey's ''A Million Little Pieces'' would be offered a refund. In order to receive the refund, customers must submit a proof of purchase, pieces of the book itself (page 163 from the hard cover or the front cover from the paperback), and complete a sworn statement indicating that they purchased the book under the assumption that it was a memoir.

In Frey's note to readers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.biz/media/pdfs/AMLP020106.pdf A note to the reader]&lt;/ref&gt; which will be included in future editions of the book, he apologized for fabricating portions of his book and for having made himself seem "tougher and more daring and more aggressive than in reality I was, or I am." He added,
:"People cope with adversity in many different ways, ways that are deeply personal. [...] My mistake [...] is writing about the person I created in my mind to help me cope, and not the person who went through the experience."
Frey admitted that he had literary reasons for his fabrications, as well:
:"I wanted the stories in the book to ebb and flow, to have dramatic arcs, to have the tension that all great stories require."
Nevertheless, he defended the right of memoirists to draw upon their memories, not simply upon documented facts, in creating their memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-ap-books-disputed-memoir-story.htmlJames Frey Admits Memoir's Alterations]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Frey has discussed the controversy and stated his side of the argument on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigjimindustries.com/wordpress/ James Frey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Frey's return to the Oprah Winfrey show, the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] went as far as recataloging Frey's book as fiction, although it appears most other libraries have not followed suit. The [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] still includes it on the Paperback Nonfiction List as of September 2006.

Regardless of this controversy, the book has been published in twenty-nine languages worldwide and has sold over 5 million copies. The majority of these sales occurred after Oprah announced it as the new [[Oprah's Book Club]] book.

On January 18, 2006, [[Marty Angelo]], prison minister and author of the book ''Once Life Matters: A New Beginning'', came to the defense of James Frey in a press release. While Angelo did not condone the inclusion of fictional elements in a book marketed as non-fiction, he stated, “The controversy surrounding the recent accusations that Frey embellished some of his statements in his book is relatively minor compared to the fact this man claims he cleared one of the biggest hurdles in his life—his substance abuse. That’s the bottom line issue.”

“Right now the media seems to be negatively attacking the messenger instead of concentrating on promoting the positive message of redemption...” Angelo added. “In terms of the benefit to readers as a self-help book, the message is the key issue, not the minor story details. One needs to stay focused on what the real message is—overcoming addiction.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martyangelo.com/book_press.htm Christian Prison Evangelist Sides with Oprah Winfrey @ Marty Angelo Ministries&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2007, at a literary convention in Texas, [[Nan Talese]] spoke of Oprah Winfrey as having been "mean and self-serving" and having had a "holier-than-thou attitude" and "fiercely bad manners" during Winfrey's debate with Talese and James Frey on January 26, 2006. Talese said she and Frey were led to believe the show was going to be a panel discussion on "Truth in America". Just before air time, both Talese and Frey were told the topic of the show had been changed to "The James Frey Controversy", thus the ambush began. Talese stated that Oprah needed to apologize for her behavior on the show. However [[Joyce Carol Oates]] said "This is an ethical issue which can be debated passionately and with convincing arguments on both sides. In the end, Oprah Winfrey had to defend her own ethical standards of truth on her television program, which was courageous of her." Talese was unapologetic about publishing Frey's ''A Million Little Pieces'' and commented the book has great value for anyone who must deal with a loved one who is an addict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1648140,00.html?cnn=yes | accessdate = July 30, 2007 | work=Time | title=Oprah vs. James Frey: The Sequel | date=July 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Touch Away''''' (Merchak Negi'aa; Hebrew, '''מרחק נגיעה''') is a 2006 Israeli television eight-episode mini-series set in [[Bnei Brak]], a city to the east of [[Tel Aviv]], within the larger [[Tel Aviv District]], in [[Israel]]. It has been described as a kind of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' story, focusing on the relationship of a young secular Jewish immigrant from [[Russia]] who falls in love with a young woman who is part of the city's [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-orthodox]] community. Using this relationship as the basis for the story, the series explores the lives of new immigrants, non-religious, and religious Jews in Israel.

The Bermans are a strictly religious family, whose daughter Rochale is about to enter into an arranged marriage with a wealthy young bridegroom. But sparks fly when a thoroughly secular family from Russia moves into a neighboring apartment. The forbidden love that soon blossoms between the two young neighbors, and the secrets that each family must hide, threaten the families deeply rooted traditions and challenge individual family member's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ttv.co.il/movies/movie.aspx?Z18vrVQ=J&amp;t04=F&amp;tabitem=3 |title=A Touch Away: Selected film festivals &amp; Awards |publisher=T.T.V Productions Ltd. |accessdate=September 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306155401/http://www.ttv.co.il/movies/movie.aspx?Z18vrVQ=J&amp;t04=F&amp;tabitem=3 |archivedate=March 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hjalmars avsked av Orvar Odd efter striden på Samsö.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Norwegian warrior [[Örvar-Oddr]] bids a last farewell to his blood brother, the Swedish warrior [[Hjalmar]], by [[Mårten Eskil Winge]] (1866).]]
'''Blood brother''' can refer to one of two things: a male [[Kinship|related by birth]], or two or more men not related by [[birth]] who have sworn loyalty to each other. This is in modern times usually done in a ceremony, known as a '''blood [[oath]]''', where each person makes a small cut, usually on a finger, hand or the [[forearm]], and then the two cuts are pressed together and bound, the idea being that each person's blood now flows in the other participant's [[veins]]. The act may carry a risk due to [[blood-borne disease]]s. In modern times, some gangs have also been rumored to make blood pacts. The process usually provides a participant with a heightened symbolic sense of attachment with another participant.

==Cultures==

===Scandinavia===

The Norsemen entering into the pact of foster brotherhood ({{lang-is|[[:is:Fóstbræðralag|Fóstbræðralag]]}}) involved a rite whereby they let their blood flow while they ducked underneath an arch formed by a strip of turf propped up by a spear or spears. An example is described in ''[[Gísla saga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Poole |first=Russell |author-link=Russell Poole |title=Claiming Kin Skaldic-Style |work=Verbal Encounters: Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse Studies for Roberta Frank |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8naeLlWGikC&amp;pg=PA278 |page=278 |isbn=9780802080110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Dasent|1866}}|translator=George Webbe Dasent|translator-link=George Webbe Dasent |others=Mildmay, C.

''[[Örvar-Oddr's saga]]'' contains another notable account of blood brotherhood. [[Örvar-Oddr]], after fighting the renowned Swedish warrior [[Hjalmar]] to a draw, entered into foster-brotherhood with him {{Dubious span|by this turf-raising ritual. Afterwards, the strand of turf was put back during oaths and incantations.|date=May 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} 

In the mythology of northern Europe, [[Gunther]] and [[Högni]] became the blood brothers of [[Sigurd]] when he married their sister [[Gudrun]]; in [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring Cycle]]'', the same occurs between [[Gunther]] and Wagner's version of Sigurd, [[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]], which is marked by the "Blood Brotherhood [[Leitmotiv]]". Additionally, it is briefly stated in [[Lokasenna]] that [[Odin]] and [[Loki]] are blood brothers.

===Scythia===
Among the [[Scyth]]ians, the covenantors would allow their blood to drip into a cup; the blood was subsequently mixed with wine and drunk by both participants. Every man was limited to having at most three blood brotherhoods at any time, lest his loyalties be distrusted; as a consequence, blood brotherhood was highly sought after and often preceded by a lengthy period of affiliation and friendship ([[Lucian]], ''[[Toxaris]]''). 
4th-century BC depictions of two Scythian warriors drinking from a single [[drinking horn]] (most notably in a gold appliqué from [[Kul-Oba]]) have been associated with the Scythian oath of blood brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar Meyer, ''Greco-Scythian Art and the Birth of Eurasia: From Classical Antiquity to Russian Modernity'',  OUP (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=884TAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 246 (fig. 98b)] "Gold relief appliqué showing two Scythians drinking from one drinking horn. From [[Kul-Oba]] (Inventory 2, K.12h). Rostoftzeff identified the scene with the Scythain sacred oath described in Herodotus 4.70. Fourth century BC. 5 × 3.7 cm, 28.35 gr."; see also

The Hungarian [[hajduk]]s had a similar ceremony, though the wine was often replaced with milk so that the blood would be more visible.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Asia===
In [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]], the act and ceremony of becoming blood brothers is generally seen as a [[tribal]] relationship, that is, to bring about alliance between tribes. It was practiced for this reason most notably among the [[Mongol]]s and [[Chinese history|early Chinese]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'','' the Chinese classical literature, the three main characters took an oath of blood brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Oath of the Peach Garden|date=2018-07-28|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oath_of_the_Peach_Garden&amp;oldid=852357830|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolian history, Genghis Khan the Great had an anda, blood brother in Mongolian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/anda|title=Anda {{!}} oath|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
The blood oath was used in much the same fashion as has already been described in much of 
[[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The British colonial administrator [[Lord Lugard]] is famous for having become blood brothers with numerous African chiefs as part of his political policy while in Africa. A powerful blood brother of his was the 
[[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] chieftain [[Waiyaki Wa Hinga]].

===Americas===
There may be some evidence that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] performed blood oathes to bring about [[Political alliance|alliances]] between tribes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Southeastern Europe===
Blood brothers among larger groups were common in ancient [[Southeastern Europe]] where, for example, whole companies of soldiers would become one family through the ceremony. It was perhaps most prevalent in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, as it helped the oppressed people to fight the enemy more effectively; blood brotherhoods were common in what is today [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Christianity also recognized sworn brotherhood in a ceremony (known as {{lang-gr|[[adelphopoiesis]]}}, {{lang-sla|pobratimstvo}} in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches; known as {{lang-la|ordo ad fratres faciendum}} in the [[Roman Catholic]] church). The tradition of intertwining arms and drinking wine is also believed to be a representation of becoming blood brothers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Caucasus===
Blood brotherhood, highly ritualized and subjected to a strong code, was a common practice in the [[Caucasus]], especially among the mountaineers. Some relics of this tradition survive to this day.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Famous blood brothers==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2018}}
=== Historical ===
* The chiefs of the seven [[Hungarian tribes]] formed an alliance by drinking from each other's blood, while choosing [[Álmos]] as their leader in the 9th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Anonymus | title = Gesta Hungarorum | year = c. 1200 | url= http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/18975/1/18975.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yesükhei]] and [[Keraites#Khanate|Toghril]]. Yesükhei was [[Genghis Khan]]'s father. Toghril is better known by his Chinese name [[Wang Khan]].
* The Greek [[Nikolaos Kriezotis]] and the Serbian [[Vasos Mavrovouniotis]] in the [[Greek War of Independence]]
* [[Temüjin]] (Genghis Khan) and [[Jamukha]] were childhood friends and blood brothers, although Jamukha later betrayed Temüjin, and was executed at the order of Temüjin.

* [[Samoans|Samoan]] [[professional wrestler]] [[Peter Maivia|"High Chief" Peter Maivia]] was considered a blood brother of Amituanai Anoa'i, the father of the fellow professional wrestlers [[Afa Anoaʻi|Afa]] and [[Sika Anoaʻi|Sika Anoa'i]], who are better known as [[the Wild Samoans]], thus the Anoa'i family regard the Maivia line from him on forward as an extension of their own clan.

=== Folklore and popular culture ===

In the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]], these three men swore in their famous [[Oath of the Peach Garden]] that despite not being born on the same day, their sworn brotherhood would end with them dying on the same day. Histories only mention that the three men were "close like brothers".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5427">'''Bor, Mámor, Bénye Festival (Wine, Shine...Bénye)''' - festival in the gardens of Erdőbénye was born in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.winesofa.eu/articles/wine-shine-benye-2016|title=Wine, Shine... Bénye 2016|website=WineSofa : Wine &amp; Adventures in CEE|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; from an ideas session of six wineries in [[Hungary]], [[Tokaj wine region|Tokaj Wine Region]], [[Erdőbénye]]. The local wine makers, who later formed an association – have staged this gastro-cultural event every year since.

== History&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bormamorbenye.hu/programok-korabban/|title=Programok korábban - Bor, mámor ...Bénye|work=Bor, mámor ...Bénye|access-date=2018-03-09|language=hu-HU}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

=== The Beginnings ===
The event was born in 2009 from an ideas session and cooperation between six local wineries. The first festival was a one-day event on 15 th August 2009 where, as well as the local wineries, Hungarian gastrobloggers and regional restaurants created dishes founded on [[Zemplén County|Zemplén]] flavours and raw ingredients, thus developing a distinct gastro-thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://borravalo.hu/bor-mamor-golden-valley/|title=Bor, mámor, Golden Valley {{!}} borravalo.hu|date=2009-08-17|work=borravalo.hu|access-date=2018-03-09|language=hu-HU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to great interest, in 2010 the participants founded the Bor, Mámor, Bénye Association to be able to continue the work more professionally and since then it has been the Festival organizer.

Two years later, in 2011, the festival expanded with a Friday night opening concert and joint tasting of all where the participating wineries came together to present their wines at a guided tasting.

=== Expansion ===
By 2013 the festival ran Friday-Saturday- Sunday with more events. By then over 12 wineries had joined the initiative and the event had become known throughout Hungary and popular with wine lovers from Poland and the Carpathian Basin. The festival also offered a campsite and parking area by then. That is when the entry system was introduced.

=== Today ===
In 2016 the event was a four-day event, to be more precise three days+zero day. The opening concert which had been on Friday moved with the joint tasting to Thursday evening. In 2017 the date of the festival changed to early July. The event will return to the original August time in 2019.

== Venue ==
The event is held in Hungary, in the [[Tokaj wine region|Tokaj Wine Region]] village of [[Erdőbénye]], where the venues for the wide range of events are the local gardens and cellars of the wineries, churches, village house museum and nearby vineyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://winicjatywa.pl/bor-mamor-benye-2017/|title=Festiwal w Erdőbénye czeka! {{!}} Winicjatywa|date=2017-05-26|work=Winicjatywa|access-date=2018-03-09|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current participants: Ábrahám Wine, Bardon Winery, Béres Vineyards and Winery, Budaházy-Fekete Kúria Winery, Csite Family Estate, Illés Cellar, Jakab Winery, Karádi-Berger Winery, Kerékgyártó Cellar, Préselő Winery, Pro Vinum Winery, Sanzon Tokaj, Vayi Winery.

== Gastronomy ==
It was primarily gastro-bloggers who created the dishes at the beginning. Over the years top restaurants from the region and Hungary came to the forefront.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tokajtoday.com/2017/07/11/wine-shine-benye-2017/|title=WINE, SHINE, BÉNYE 2017|website=www.tokajtoday.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers aim to show local ingredients and recipes in the long term. The Tokaj Wine Region produces white wines and the wines that can be tasted in the wineries’ cellars are mainly white wines: The main varieties are [[Furmint]], [[Hárslevelű]] and [[Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains|Muscat Lunel]] along with cuvées hereof.

== Events ==
The long weekend starts with Thursday evening joint tasting in which all the wineries participate followed by a concert. The other days of the festival see the wineries’ gardens become the venues for events.

Music ranges through [[jazz]], [[folk music]] and [[world music]]. Artists have performed here including [[Muzsikás]], [[Viktor Tóth]], [[Vilmos Gryllus]], [[Mihály Dresch]], but the organizers place great emphasis on bringing less well-known talents to the festival too. From 2018 the event also provides a home for the coopers’ dance, unique to this barrel-making village, and showing the traditions of barrel making. In addition there are exhibitions, literary readings and interviews, plus handcrafts, children’s events, round table discussions, thematic tastings, bicycle tours and other events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tokajwineregion.com/2015/08/bor-mamor-benye/|title=Magical Erdőbénye - Bor, Mámor...

The '''Bruges dialect''' ([[Dutch language|Standard Dutch]] and [[West Flemish]]: ''Brugs'') is a West Flemish dialect used in [[Bruges]]. It is rapidly declining, being replaced with what scholars call general (rural) West Flemish.{{sfnp|Hinskens|Taeldeman|2013|p=167}}{{sfnp|Vandekerckhove|2010|p=326}}{{sfnp|Taeldeman|2005|p=277}}

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
* After {{IPA|/u/}}, the sequence {{IPA|/nd/}} is realized as a velar nasal {{IPAblink|ŋ}}.{{sfnp|Hinskens|Taeldeman|2013|p=167}}
* The sequence {{IPA|/ən/}} is realized as a sequence {{IPA|[ən]}}, rather than a syllabic {{IPA|[n̩]}}.{{sfnp|Hinskens|Taeldeman|2013|p=167}}

====Realization of {{IPA|/r/}}====
According to {{Harvcoltxt|Hinskens|Taeldeman|2013}}, {{IPA|/r/}} is realized as a voiced uvular trill with little friction {{IPAblink|ʀ̝}}. In the neighbouring rural area, an alveolar {{IPAblink|r}} is used.{{sfnp|Hinskens|Taeldeman|2013|p=167}}

However, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Sebregts|2014}}, the vast majority of the speakers in Bruges realize {{IPA|/r/}} as alveolar, not uvular.{{sfnp|Sebregts|2014|p=90}}

Definitely, the most common realization of {{IPA|/r/}} is a voiced alveolar tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, which is used about four times more often than the second most common realization, which is a voiced alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r}}. The other alveolar realizations include: a voiceless alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r̥}}, a partially devoiced alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r̥}}, a voiceless alveolar fricative tap/trill {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɾ̞̊}} ~ {{IPA link|r̝̊}}]}}, a voiceless alveolar/postalveolar fricative {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɹ̝̊}}, {{IPA link|ɹ̠̊˔}}]}} (the least common realization), a voiced alveolar/postalveolar fricative {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɹ̝}} ~ {{IPA link|ɹ̠˔}}]}} and a voiced alveolar approximant {{IPAblink|ɹ}}.{{sfnp|Sebregts|2014|p=90}}

Among the uvular realizations, he lists a voiced uvular trill {{IPAblink|ʀ}}, a voiced uvular fricative trill {{IPAblink|ʀ̝}}, a voiced uvular fricative {{IPAblink|ʁ}} and a voiced uvular approximant {{IPAblink|ʁ̞}}, among which the uvular fricative trill is the most common realization. He also lists a central vowel (which probably means {{IPAblink|ə}}, {{IPAblink|ɐ}} or both of these) and elision of {{IPA|/r/}}, both of which are very rare.{{sfnp|Sebregts|2014|p=90}}

* In comparison with Standard Dutch, the short front vowels underwent a chain shift, so that the standard {{IPA|/i, y, ɪ, ʏ, ɛ/}} became {{IPA|/ɪ, ʏ, ɛ, œ, æ/}}. The standard {{IPA|/u/}} was also lowered to {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, yet the standard {{IPA|/ɔ/}} was left untouched.
* Among the back vowels, {{IPA|/ʊ, ɔ, ɔː/}} are rounded, whereas {{IPA|/ɑ, ɑː/}} are unrounded.
* {{IPA|/ɪ, ʏ, ʊ/}} are near-close {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ̟}}, {{IPA link|ʏ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ̠}}]}}; {{IPA|/ɪ/}} is fully front, whereas {{IPA|/ʊ/}} is fully back.
* {{IPA|/ʏ, ʊ, œː/}} (but not {{IPA|/œ, ɔ, ɔː/}}) are rather weakly rounded {{IPA|[ʏ̜, ʊ̜, œ̜ː]}}.
* Phonetically, {{IPA|/ɛ, ə/}} are mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛ̝}}, {{IPA link|ə}}]}}, whereas {{IPA|/ɛː, ɛ̃ː, œ, œː, ɔ, ɔː/}} are open-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛː}}, ɛ̃ː, {{IPA link|œ}}, {{IPA link|œː}}, {{IPA link|ɔ}}, {{IPA link|ɔː}}]}}.
* Before {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/æ/}} is lowered and retracted to {{IPAblink|ɑ}}. This feature is typical of working class speech and is nearly extinct.{{sfnp|Hinskens|Taeldeman|2013|p=167}}{{sfnp|Vandekerckhove|2010|p=326}}

* All of the diphthongs are falling.
* {{IPA|/eɪ, øʏ, oʊ/}} used to be pronounced as monophthongs {{IPA|[eː, øː, oː]}},{{sfnp|Hinskens|Taeldeman|2013|p=167}} a realization which is rapidly regaining popularity among younger speakers.
* Traditionally, {{IPA|/ɔu/}} used to have such a close first element that there was practically no distinction between {{IPA|/ɔu/}} and {{IPA|/oʊ/}}.
* Phonetically, {{IPA|/ɔːə/}} can be either {{IPA|[ɔːə]}} or {{IPA|[ɔːɑ]}}.

'''Chilean cinema''' refers to all films produced in [[Chile]] or made by [[Chilean people|Chileans]].

It had its origins at the start of the 20th century with the first Chilean film screening in 1902 and the first Chilean [[feature film]] appearing in 1910. The oldest surviving feature is ''[[El Húsar de la Muerte]]'' (1925), and the last silent film was ''Patrullas de Avanzada'' (1931). The Chilean film industry struggled in the late 1940s and in the 1950s, despite some box-office successes such as ''El Diamante de Maharajá''. The 1960s saw the development of the "New Chilean Cinema", with films like ''[[Three Sad Tigers]]'' (1968), ''[[Jackal of Nahueltoro]]'' (1969) and ''[[Valparaíso mi amor]]'' (1969). After the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 military coup]], film production was low, with many filmmakers working in [[exile]]. It increased after the end of the [[Pinochet regime]] in 1989, with occasional critical and/or popular successes such as ''[[Johnny cien pesos]]'' (1993), ''Historias de Fútbol'' (1997) and ''Gringuito'' (1998).

Greater box office success came in the late 1990s and early 2000s with films like ''[[El Chacotero Sentimental: la película]]'' (1999), ''[[Sexo con Amor]]'' (2003), ''Sub Terra'' (2003), and ''[[Machuca]]'' (2004) all of which were surpassed by ''Stefan v/s Kramer'' (2012) and ''[[No Filter (film)|Sin filtro]]'' (2016).

In recent years, Chilean films have made increasingly regular appearances at international film festivals, with ''[[No (2012 film)|No]]'' (2012) becoming the first Chilean film nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and ''[[A Fantastic Woman]]'' (2017) the first to win it.&lt;ref&gt;http://deadline.com/2018/03/a-fantastic-woman-wins-oscar-best-foreign-language-film-1202310740/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===

On 17 February 1895 entrepreneur Francisco de Paola presented the first [[Kinetoscope]], an [[History of film|early motion picture]] exhibition device, in [[Santiago]]. Next year, on 25 August 1896, the first [[Cinematograph|Cinématographe]] reels were shown to an astounded audience in [[Santiago]]. These were the same movies that only eight months earlier, the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumiere Brothers]] had shown in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmbirth.com/chile.html History of Cinema in Chile (EN)] www.filmbirth.com © Copyright 2001-2009 Filmbirth.com All Rights Reserved, retrieved on 18 November&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north of Chile, the [[Potassium nitrate]] mining industry created enough wealth to allow cities like [[Antofagasta]] and [[Iquique]] some privileges rare in other parts of the country.
In Iquique, photographer Luis Oddó Osorio was enthralled by this new technology and started to create his own short films. On 20 May 1897, he screened the short documentary "Una cueca en Cavancha"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinechile.cl/pelicula.php?pelicula_id=1520 Una cueca en Cavancha] Cinechile, Enciclopedia del Cine Chileno / Santiago, Chile , retrieved on November 18&lt;/ref&gt; in the Great Philharmonic Hall on Tarapaca Street. Osorio followed his first short with "El desfile en honor del Brasil",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinechile.cl/pelicula.php?pelicula_id=1519 El desfile en honor del Brasil] Cinechile, Enciclopedia del Cine Chileno / Santiago, Chile, retrieved on November 18&lt;/ref&gt; "La llegada de un tren de pasajeros a la estación de Iquique",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinechile.cl/pelicula.php?pelicula_id=1521 La llegada de un tren de pasajeros a la estación de Iquique] Cinechile, Enciclopedia del Cine Chileno / Santiago, Chile, retrieved on November 18&lt;/ref&gt; "Bomba Tarapacá Nº7"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinechile.cl/pelicula.php?pelicula_id=1522 Bomba Tarapacá Nº7] Cinechile, Enciclopedia del Cine Chileno / Santiago, Chile, retrieved on 18 November&lt;/ref&gt; and "Grupo de gananciosos en la partida de football"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinechile.cl/pelicula.php?pelicula_id=1523 Grupo de gananciosos en la partida de football] Cinechile, Enciclopedia del Cine Chileno / Santiago, Chile /, retrieved on 18 November&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1897, some [[circus]]es began to screen movies, which attracted great interest at first but soon trailed off due to the lack of new material. In the same year in Santiago, two new movie venues opened which both featured [[Thomas Edison|Edison's]] [[Vitascope]], less popular than the [[Cinematograph|Cinématographe]]. In June that year, the [[Bioscop]] was also launched as another alternative to the cinematographe, although it eventually failed. By the end of the year, all these new places would be closed.

In 1900, the Apollo Theatre in Santiago exhibited the film "Carreras en Viña", (Racing in [[Viña del Mar|Viña]]) and some other foreign films. The exact date that the films screened and further details of this event remain unknown.

In the port city of [[Valparaíso]], the first film ever fully produced in Chile was launched at the Teatro ODEON on 26 May 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Re-visión del Cine Chileno, Alicia Vega, p.204. [http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0014622 Link to e-book on MemoriaChilena.cl] Retrieved 10 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The film, ''Ejercicio General del Cuerpo de Bomberos''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinechile.cl/pelicula.php?pelicula_id=896 Ejercicio general del Cuerpo de Bomberos (1902)] Cinechile, Enciclopedia del Cine Chileno / Santiago, Chile /retrieved on 18 November&lt;/ref&gt; (General Practice of the Fire Department), filmed on 20 May the same year, was only three minutes long and showed the annual public show performed by the Valparaíso Fire Department in the city's [[Plaza Aníbal Pinto|Aníbal Pinto square]]. Nothing is known of the film's director, cinematographer or production team, and only 27 seconds of footage remain today, held by the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso|Catholic University of Valparaíso]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinechile.cl/pelicula-896 Ejercicio General del Cuerpo de Bomberos] Cine Chile: Enciclopedia del Cine Chileno. Retrieved 10 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, "Un paseo por playa ancha" (A walk through Playa Ancha) was filmed in [[Valparaiso]] by Maurice Albert Massonnier. The film is split into three parts. First, a [[huaso]] charges into the scene, causing some commotion among the people around, and dances the traditional Chilean [[cueca]] accompanied by musicians. This is followed by a scene where the characters eat a [[Cazuela#Chilean Cazuelas|Chilean Cazuela]]. Finally, in the last scene, a fight breaks but is quickly controlled by a guard. Maurice Albert Massonnier was sent to Chile by the Lumiere Brothers’ company, one of many sent around the world to document and produce films for them. After screening his film in Chile, Massonnier sent the film to Paris, where several copies were made. One of those copies was found in 1994 by Chilean film restorer Daniel Sandoval in an archive on Bois-d'Arcy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinetecadigital.ccplm.cl/Pelicula?ID=cf0f43d5-f043-64b8-a99e-ff0000f0762f "Un paseo por playa ancha" online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205112355/http://cinetecadigital.ccplm.cl/Pelicula?ID=cf0f43d5-f043-64b8-a99e-ff0000f0762f |date=5 December 2014 }} CINETECA NACIONAL DEL CENTRO CULTURAL LA MONEDA, retrieved on 18 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "Un paseo por playa ancha" is now the oldest surviving Chilean movie. Massonier ended up settling in Chile and made his own production company, "Empresa Massonnier y Ca".

===The silent era===
[[File:Manuel Rodríguez (1910).webm|thumbtime=1|thumb|''Manuel Rodríguez'' (fragment)]]
Film production boomed in Chile in the silent era, with 78 films released between 1910 and 1931. The first full-length film, ''Manuel Rodríguez'', was released in 1910. Directed by Adolfo Urzúa, and starring Nicanor de la Sotta, it told the story of [[Manuel Rodríguez Erdoíza]], who fought for Chile's independence from Spain until his death in 1818.&lt;ref name="Historia del Cine Chileno"&gt;[http://www.emol.com/especiales/festivaldivia_05/historiacinecl.htm Historia del Cine Chileno] Festival Internacional de Cine de Valdivia, September 2005, Emol.cl (website of El Mercurio newspaper). Retrieved 10 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many Chilean directors who took up the art in this period – Salvatore Giambastini, Juan Pérez Berrocal, Jorge "Coke" Délano, Nicanor de la Sotta, Carlos Borcosque and Alberto Santana – one name in particular stands out for film historians: [[Pedro Sienna]], a former stage actor who went on to direct and act in some of the best films of the age.&lt;ref name="Historia del Cine Chileno"/&gt;
It was Sienna who wrote, directed and starred in the first Chilean feature-length film that has survived to this day, ''[[El Húsar de la Muerte]]'' (The Hussar of the Dead).

Premiered in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] on 24 November 1925, ''El Húsar de la Muerte'' – like Adolfo Urzúa's eponymous ''Manuel Rodríguez'' – tells the story of Manuel Rodríguez Erdoíza. The film was restored in 1962 by the [[University of Chile]]’s film archive, with a musical soundtrack by well-known Chilean composer and pianist [[Sergio Ortega]]. ''El Húsar de la Muerte'' was shown in the Treasures from the Archives category of the 2005 [[London Film Festival]]. Critic Carolina Robino described ''El Húsar de la Muerte'' in [[BBC Mundo]] as "an extremely refined film for its era. The visual imagery has an extraordinary richness. Sienna plays masterfully with the time-shifts, with the subjective view of the characters and with their thoughts. Without words, it tells an epic story with exquisite touches of humor and provides an accurate description of [[colonial Chile|Chilean colonial society]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/misc/newsid_4370000/4370954.stm Obsesionado con el húsar] Carolina Robino, BBC Mundo, 24 October 2005. Retrieved 10 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last silent movie produced in Chile was ''Patrullas de Avanzada'' (Advanced Patrol), directed by Eric Page and released in 1931.&lt;ref name="Historia del Cine Chileno"/&gt;

===1940s and 1950s===
In 1942, the Chilean Production Development Corporation (Spanish: "Corporación de Fomento de la Producción" or [[CORFO]]) created the Chile Films project, which provided filmmakers with technical resources and supported the Chilean film industry. Despite this, the industry began to struggle in the late 1940s with some studios experiencing financial difficulties. Large sums of money were spent on cinematic "super-productions" to attract foreign directors, but most failed to make a profit.&lt;ref name="Historia del Cine Chileno"/&gt; One film which did buck the trend, however, was adventure-comedy ''El Diamante de Maharajá'' (The Maharaja Diamond), starring comedian Lucho Córdoba, which was a box-office hit.

The low-output trend continued into the 1950s, with only 13 films released in Chile over the course of the decade. Towards the end of the 1950s, however, two films appeared which gave a taste of the new wave of socially conscious cinema that would sweep Chile in the 1960s: Naum Kramarenko's ''Tres miradas a la calle'' (Three Views of the Street, 1957) and ''Deja que los perros ladren'' (Let the Dogs Bark, 1961).&lt;ref name="Historia del Cine Chileno"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===The "New Chilean Cinema", 1960s-1989===
In the 1960s, a vibrant national film culture developed which came to be known as the "New Chilean Cinema" ({{lang-es|link=no|Nuevo Cine Chileno}}). An experimental film department was founded at the [[University of Chile]], along with a Film Institute at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile|Catholic University of Chile]]. The industry also received support from the revitalised Chile Films project which had begun in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radio.uchile.cl/noticias/67049/ Antonella Estévez y las transformaciones del Cine Chileno en ARTV] Radio Universidad Chile website, 11 May 2010. Retrieved 12 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, young directors such as [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]], [[Patricio Guzmán]], [[Aldo Francia]], [[Helvio Soto]] and [[Miguel Littín]] emerged, along with a new genre inspired by social and political currents on the 1960s, the documentary.&lt;ref name="Historia del Cine Chileno"/&gt;

The first ever "Festival del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano" (New Latin American Film Festival) took place in [[Viña del Mar]] in 1967. Shortly afterwards some of the most important films from the New Chilean Cinema period were released: veteran Patricio Kaulen's ''[[Largo viaje]]'' (1967), [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]]'s ''[[Three Sad Tigers]]'' (1968), [[Miguel Littín]]'s ''[[Jackal of Nahueltoro]]'' (1969), [[Aldo Francia]]'s ''[[Valparaíso mi amor]]'' (1969) and [[Helvio Soto]]'s ''[[Caliche sangriento]]'' (1969).&lt;ref name="Historia del Cine Chileno"/&gt;

Politics was a key theme for Chilean cinema in the 1960s and beyond, as it was for similar movements in other South American countries (the [[Cinema of Brazil|Cinema Novo]] of [[Brazil]] and the [[Cinema of Argentina|Nueva Cinema]] of Argentina) and for Chilean movements in other fields of the arts, such as the [[Nueva canción#Chile|Nueva Canción Chilena]] (New Chilean Song). "This left-wing Chilean filmmakers’ movement cannot be understood without connecting it to the emerging social and political identity of the American continent", states the Chilean cultural website [[Memoria Chilena]].&lt;ref name="Nuevo Cine Chileno"&gt;[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/dest.asp?id=cinech50nuevo Nuevo Cine Chileno] Memoriachilena.cl. Retrieved 15 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 military coup]] drove many filmmakers abroad, where they continued to make films reflecting on and criticising the Chilean military government under [[Augusto Pinochet]]. Memoria Chilena says: "The premises of the Nuevo Cine did not die with the massive exile of filmmakers. Instead they were reinterpreted in the cinema of exile as protest against the repression under the military regime or expressing nostalgia for the shattered revolution." Some of the best known include ''[[The Promised Land (1973 film)|The Promised Land]]'' (1973), ''[[Il pleut sur Santiago]]'' (1975), ''[[Dialogues of Exiles]]'' (1975), ''[[Actas de Marusia]]'' (1975), ''[[Cantata de Chile]]'' (1976), ''[[Noch nad Chili]]'' (1977), ''[[The Battle of Chile]]'' (1979), [[Marilú Mallet]]'s ''[[Journal inachevé]]'' (1982), [[Angelina Vásquez]]'s ''[[Presencia lejana]]'' (1982) and ''[[Acta General de Chile]]'' (1986).&lt;ref name="Nuevo Cine Chileno"/&gt;

===Transition post-dictatorship, 1989-1999===
Film production within Chile was relatively low throughout the military regime, with most filmmakers working in exile, but began to increase again when the regime ended in 1989. In 1992, the [[FONDART]] national art fund was established which would go on to support some 90% of Chilean feature-length films made since its creation. Although many films released in the late 1980s and early 1990s received both public and critical acclaim, including ''Johnny Cien Pesos'' (Hundred Peso Johnny, 1993) by Gustavo Graef-Marino; ''Historias de Fútbol'' (Soccer Stories, 1997) the debut film from [[Andrés Wood]] and ''Gringuito'' (1998) by Sergio Castilla, Chilean movies struggled to compete with international films for audience numbers.&lt;ref name="Historia del Cine Chileno"/&gt;

The next decade saw this trend begin to change. The more commercial 1999 release ''[[El Chacotero Sentimental]]'' (The Sentimental Joker), by Cristián Galaz, broke Chilean box office records.&lt;ref name="Historia del Cine Chileno"/&gt;

===International awards since 2000===

Since 2000, Chilean films were box-office successes like [[Jorge Olguín (director)|Jorge Olguín's]] ''Ángel Negro'' (Black Angel, 2000) and Alejandro Rojas’ ''Ogú y Mampato en Rapa Nui'' (Ogú and Mampato on Easter Island, 2002). In 2003, the comedy ''Sexo con Amor'' (Sex with Love) by [[Boris Quercia]] set a new national box office record which would remain unbroken until 2012.&lt;ref name="Historia del Cine Chileno"/&gt; Chilean films also began to win awards at noted international festivals. Silvio Caiozzi's ''[[Coronación]]'' (Coronation, 2000) won prizes at the [[Montreal World Film Festival|Montreal]], [[Festival de Cine Iberoamericano de Huelva|Huelva]], [[Cartagena Film Festival|Cartagena]] and [[Havana Film Festival|Havana]] film festivals; Andrés Wood's ''[[La Fiebre del Loco]]'' (Abalone Fever, 2001) won at Cartagena and [[Lleida#Film|Lleida]]; and ''Taxi Para Tres'' (Taxi For Three, 2001) by [[Orlando Lübbert]] won at Cartagena, Havana, [[Mar del Plata Film Festival|Mar del Plata]], [[Miami International Film Festival|Miami]] and [[San Sebastián International Film Festival|San Sebastián]].&lt;ref name="Historia del Cine Chileno"/&gt;

[[Chilean President]] [[Ricardo Lagos]] founded the [[National Council of Culture and the Arts]] in 2003 and, since 2005, FONDART has been supplemented by additional competitive State funds which are allocated to encourage film production, distribution, literacy and heritage through the [[Consejo del Arte y la Industria Audiovisual]] (CAIA) and the [[Fondo de Fomento Audiovisual]].

[[File:Clothes.jpg|thumb|[[History of clothing and textiles|Clothing in history]], showing (from top) Egyptians, Ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Franks, and 13th through 15th century Europeans.]]

'''Clothing''' (also known as '''clothes''', '''apparel''' and '''attire''') is a collective term for items worn on the body. Clothing can be made of [[textile]]s, [[animal skin]], or other thin sheets of materials put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to [[human being]]s and is a feature of all human [[societies]]. The amount and type of clothing worn depend on body type, social, and geographic considerations. Some clothing can be gender-specific.

Physically, clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the [[weather|elements]] and can enhance safety during hazardous activities such as [[hiking]] and [[cooking]]. It protects the wearer from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, [[Insect bites and stings|insect bites]], [[splinter]]s, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns and prickles]] by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a [[hygienic]] barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]].

Wearing clothes is also a [[Dress code|social norm]], and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]], or not wearing clothes in public such that [[Sex organ#Mammals|genitals]], [[breast]]s or [[buttocks]] are visible could be seen as [[indecent exposure]].

== Origin of clothing ==
{{see also|Evolution of hair|History of clothing and textiles}}
There is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed, but some information has been inferred by studying lice which estimates the introduction of clothing at roughly 42,000–72,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser &amp; Mark Stoneking |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=13 |pages=1414–1417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325 |issue=16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120019/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoneking"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024|title=Molecular Evolution of Pediculus humanus and the Origin of Clothing|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=24|page=2309|year=2004|last1=Kittler|first1=Ralf|last2=Kayser|first2=Manfred|last3=Stoneking|first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/1/29.full "...Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use ..."], Mol Biol Evol (2011) 28 (1): 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The most obvious function of clothing is to improve the comfort of the wearer, by protecting the wearer from the elements. In hot climates, clothing provides protection from [[sunburn]] or [[wind]] damage, while in cold climates its thermal insulation properties are generally more important. Shelter usually reduces the functional need for clothing. For example, [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm home, particularly if one is living or sleeping there. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones.

Clothing performs a range of social and [[culture|cultural]] functions, such as individual, occupational and gender differentiation, and social status.&lt;ref name="Flugel1930"&gt;{{citation |date=1976|origyear= 1930 |author=Flugel, John Carl |title=The Psychology of Clothes |series=International Psycho-analytical Library |volume=No.18 |publisher=New York: AMS Press. First published by Hogarth Press, London | isbn = 0-404-14721-6 }} Alternative {{ISBN|978-0-404-14721-1}} (This work is one of the earliest attempts at an overview of the psycho-social and practical functions of clothing)&lt;/ref&gt; In many societies, norms about clothing reflect standards of [[modesty]], [[religion]], [[gender]], and [[social status]]. Clothing may also function as a form of adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.

Clothing can be and has in the past been made from a very wide variety of materials. [[Clothing material|Materials]] have ranged from leather and furs to woven materials, to elaborate and exotic natural and synthetic fabrics. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as [[Handbag|purses]]), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ([[scarves]]), worn purely for adornment ([[jewelry]]), or those that serve a function other than protection ([[eyeglasses]]), are normally considered [[fashion accessory|accessories]] rather than clothing, except for shoes.

Clothing protects against many things that might injure the uncovered human body. Clothes protect people from the elements, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. However, clothing that is too sheer, thin, small, tight, etc., offers less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as [[insect]]s, noxious chemicals, weather, [[weapons]], and contact with abrasive substances. Conversely, clothing may protect the environment from the clothing wearer: for instance doctors wear [[scrubs (clothing)|medical scrubs]].

Humans have been ingenious in devising clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as [[space suits]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suits]], [[swimsuits]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper gear]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and other pieces of [[protective clothing]]. Meanwhile, the distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut, since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider fashion in their design. The choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure reasonable clothing due to poverty or affordability, or simply lack of inclination, is sometimes said to be scruffy, ragged, or shabby.&lt;ref&gt;Baradel, Lacey. "Geographic Mobility and Domesticity in Eastman Johnson’s The Tramp." American Art 28.2 (2014): 26–49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
Although dissertations on clothing and its functions appear from the 19th century as colonists dealt with new environments,&lt;ref name="Jeffreys1858"&gt;e.g. {{citation |year=1858 |author=Jeffreys, Julius |title=The British Army in India: Its Preservation by an appropriate Clothing, Housing, Locating, Recreative Employment, and Hopeful Encouragement of the Troops |place=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans &amp; Roberts |url=https://archive.org/stream/britisharmyinin01jeffgoog#page/n7/mode/1up |accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was concerted scientific research into psycho-social, physiological and other functions of clothing (e.g. protective, cartage{{clarify|date=September 2018}}) in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as [[J.C. Flügel]]'s ''Psychology of Clothes'' in 1930,&lt;ref name="Flugel1930" /&gt; and Newburgh's seminal ''Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing'' in 1949.&lt;ref name="Newburgh1968"&gt;{{citation |date=1968|origyear= 1949 |editor=Newburgh, Louis Harry |title=Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing |place=New York &amp; London |publisher=Hafner Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1968, the field of environmental physiology had advanced and expanded significantly, but the science of clothing in relation to environmental physiology had changed little.&lt;ref name="Hertig1969"&gt;{{citation |date=February 1969 |author=Hertig, Bruce A |title=Book review: Physiology of Heat Regulation and the Science of Clothing |journal=[[Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |page=100 |url=http://journals.lww.com/joem/Citation/1969/02000/Physiology_of_Heat_Regulation_and_the_Science_of.12.aspx |accessdate=8 September 2010 |doi=10.1097/00043764-196902000-00012|pmc=1520373 }} (reviewer's name appears next to Newburgh, but was not the co-author.

==Cultural aspects==

===Gender differentiation===

[[File:Shinzō Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Advisor to [[US President]] and businesswoman [[Ivanka Trump]] (right) along with [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinzō Abe]] wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s as per their gender, 2017]]

In most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, and fabrics.

In Western societies, [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]] and [[high-heeled shoe]]s are usually seen as women's clothing, while [[necktie]]s are usually seen as men's clothing. [[Trousers]] were once seen as exclusively male clothing, but can nowadays be worn by both genders. Male clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for females. Males are typically allowed to [[bare chested|bare their chests]] in a greater variety of public places. It is generally acceptable for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual.

In some cultures, [[sumptuary law]]s regulate what men and women are required to wear. [[Islam]] requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually [[hijab]]. What qualifies as "modest" varies in different Muslim societies. However, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men are. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the [[headscarf|head-scarf]] to the [[burqa]].

Men may sometimes choose to wear [[men's skirts]] such as [[togas]] or [[kilt]]s in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.

Clothing designed to be worn by either sex is called [[unisex clothing]]. Unisex clothes, such as T-shirts, tend to be cut straighter to fit a wider variety of bodies. The majority of unisex clothing styles have started out as menswear, but some articles, like the [[fedora]], were originally worn by women.

===Social status===
[[File:MyBarong created this Custom tailored Barong Tagalog for my wedding.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|A [[Barong Tagalog]] made for a wedding ceremony.]]
[[File:Prokudin-Gorskii-19.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mohammed Alim Khan|Alim Khan]]'s bemedaled [[robe]] sends a social message about his wealth, status, and power.]]
In some societies, clothing may be used to indicate rank or [[social status|status]]. In [[ancient Rome]], for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]. In traditional [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and palaoa, or carved [[whale]] teeth. In China, before establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear [[yellow]]. History provides many examples of elaborate [[sumptuary law]]s that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, [[peer pressure]] influences clothing choice.

===Religion===

[[File:Takbir of prayer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Muslim]] men traditionally wear white robes and a cap during prayers]]
Some religious clothing might be considered a special case of occupational clothing. Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn every day as a marker for special religious status.

For example, [[Jain]]s and Muslim men wear unstitched [[cloth]] pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.

The cleanliness of religious dresses in Eastern religions like [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Jainism]] is of paramount importance since it indicates purity.

Clothing appears in numerous contexts in the [[Bible]]; the most prominent passages are: the story of [[Adam and Eve]] who made coverings for themselves out of [[fig leaf|fig leaves]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s [[Coat of many colors|cloak]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]]. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.

The Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: "...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them" (chapter 2:187).

Jewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. This practice is found in the Bible when Jacob hears of the apparent death of his son Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.divreinavon.com/pdf/BegedSimlaJBQ.pdf |title= ?|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=9 August 2010}}{{Self-published inline|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and history==
{{Main|History of clothing}}
{{See also|History of Western fashion|Category:History of clothing}}

===Early use===
According to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of [[fur]], [[leather]], leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early [[sewing needle]]s of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near [[Kostenki]], [[Russia]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffecker, J., Scott, J., ''Excavations In Eastern Europe Reveal Ancient Human Lifestyles'', University of Colorado at Boulder News Archive, March 21, 2002, [http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html colorado.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175257/http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyed [[flax]] fibers that could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] that date back to 34,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Balter M | year = 2009 | title = Clothes Make the (Hu) Man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1329 | doi = 10.1126/science.325_1329a | pmid = 19745126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kvavadze E, Bar-Yosef O, Belfer-Cohen A, Boaretto E, Jakeli N, Matskevich Z, Meshveliani T | year = 2009 | title = 30,000-Year-Old Wild Flax Fibers | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4270521| journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1359 | doi = 10.1126/science.1175404 | pmid = 19745144 }} [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/325/5946/1359/DC1/1 Supporting Online Material]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]], have conducted a genetic analysis of human [[body lice]] that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' away from the warm [[climate]] of [[Africa]], thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reed  ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | title =  Genetic Analysis of Lice Supports Direct Contact between Modern and Archaic Humans| journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e340 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020340 | pmid=15502871 | pmc=521174}}&lt;/ref&gt; For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.

===Making clothing===
{{See also|Garment industry||knitting|weaving}}
Some human cultures, such as the various peoples of the [[Arctic Circle]], traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[silk]], hemp, and [[ramie]].

Although modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The [[textile]] industry was the first to be mechanized&amp;nbsp;– with the [[power loom|powered loom]]&amp;nbsp;– during the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Different cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit&amp;nbsp;– for example, the [[dhoti]] for men and the [[sari]] for women in the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Scottish [[kilt]] and the [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[sarong]]. The clothes may simply be tied up (dhoti and sari); or pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various [[Clothing sizes|sizes]] can wear the garment.

Another approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a [[sewing machine]]. Clothing can be cut from a [[sewing pattern]] and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or [[dress form]] is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as [[gusset]]s. Traditional European patterns for men's [[shirt]]s and women's [[chemise]]s take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts.

Modern European [[fashion]] treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into [[quilt]]s.

In the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, [[photo]]s, [[painting]]s, [[mosaic]]s, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current [[fashion designer]]s, as well as costumiers for [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[film]]s, [[television]], and [[historical reenactment]].

==Contemporary clothing==
{{POV section|date=July 2017}}
{{Western dress codes}}

=== Western dress code ===
{{main|Western dress code}}
The Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years.  The mechanization of the [[textile industry]] made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices.  Styles have changed, and the availability of [[synthetic fabric]]s has changed the definition of "stylish".  In the latter half of the 20th century, [[jeans|blue jeans]] became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire.  [[Activewear]] has also become a large and growing market.

Jeans in the Western dress code are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found which include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.

The licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the [[fashion industry]] from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Gucci]], named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.

=== Spread of western styles ===
[[File:Move In Day 2011 (6099706937) (cropped).jpg|thumb|University students in [[casual clothes]] in US.]]

By the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European [[colonialism]]. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. [[Fast fashion]] clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated [[used good|used]] clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.

=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===
People may wear ethnic or [[national costume|national dress]] on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional [[hanbok]]s on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used [[T-shirt]] with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or [[tupenu]].

===Sport and activity===
{{Main|Activewear|Sportswear (fashion)}}

Most sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] garments include [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, and [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[salopettes]] (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Also, [[spandex]] materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, [[track &amp; field]], dance, gymnastics and swimming.

=== Fashion ===
{{Main|Fashion|2010s in fashion}}
Paris set the fashion trends for Europe and North America 1900–1940.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Louise Roberts,  "Samson and Delilah revisited: the politics of women's fashion in 1920s France." ''American Historical Review'' 98.3 (1993): 657–684.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1920s the goal was all about getting loose. Women wore dresses all day, everyday. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves(long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired.  Jewelry was less conspicuous.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Bliss, "'L’intelligence de la parure': Notes on Jewelry Wearing in the 1920s." ''Fashion Theory'' 20.1 (2016): 5-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Zdatny,  "The Boyish Look and the Liberated Woman: The Politics and Aesthetics of Women's Hairstyles." ''Fashion Theory'' 1.4 (1997): 367–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century a diverse range of styles exist in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive [[haute couture]] to traditional garb, to [[thrift store]] [[grunge]].  [[Fashion show]]s are events for designers to show off new and often extravagant designs.

==Political issues==

===Working conditions in the garments industry===
{{further|Garment industry}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
[[File:Garments Factory in Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|Garments factory in Bangladesh]]
[[File:Safety garb for women workers. The uniform at the left, complete with the plastic "bra" on the right, will prevent... - NARA - 522882.jpg|thumb|upright|Safety garb for women workers in [[Los Angeles]], c. 1943, was designed to prevent occupational accidents among female war workers.]]

Although [[mechanization]] transformed most aspects of human industry by the mid-20th century, [[garment]] workers have continued to labor under challenging conditions that demand repetitive manual labor. [[Mass-produced]] clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be [[sweatshops]], typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in [[developing countries]], clothes made in [[industrialized nation]]s may also be manufactured similarly.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Coalitions of [[NGO]]s, designers (including Katharine Hamnett, [[American Apparel]], [[Veja Sneakers|Veja]], [[Quiksilver]], eVocal, and Edun) and campaign groups like the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] (CCC) and the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] as well as [[textile and clothing trade unions]] have sought to improve these conditions as much as possible by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the workers.

[[Outsourcing]] production to low wage countries like Bangladesh, China, India and Sri Lanka became possible when the [[Multi Fibre Agreement]] (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a [[protectionist]] measure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Although many countries recognize treaties like the [[International Labour Organization]], which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them. India for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Despite the strong reactions that "sweatshops" evoked among [[Anti-globalization movement|critics of globalization]], the [[textile industry|production of textiles]] has functioned as a consistent industry for developing nations providing work and wages, whether construed as exploitative or not, to many thousands of people.

===Fur===
{{Main|Fur clothing}}
The use of animal fur in clothing dates to prehistoric times. It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]], along with other [[animal rights]] and [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] groups have called attention to [[fur farming]] and other practices they consider cruel.

==Life cycle==

===Clothing maintenance===
Clothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, becomes outworn, and loses functionality (as when [[button (clothing)|buttons]] fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and [[zipper]]s fail).

Often, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials like these inevitably age.

However, most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be [[laundry|laundered]] and mended (patching, [[darning]], but compare [[felt]]).

=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===
Humans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic [[washing machine]]s and [[dry cleaning]] (dissolving dirt in [[solvents]] other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] fabrics for [[hygiene]] purposes.

Many kinds of clothing are designed to be [[Ironing|ironed]] before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, [[dress shirt]]s and [[suit (clothing)|suits]]). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is [[permanent press]], having been treated with a coating (such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.

Once clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on [[clothes hanger]]s or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.

===Non-iron===
{{main|Permanent press}}
A resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php Changes of Free Formaldehyde Quantity in Non-iron Shirts by Washing and Storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124023/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php |date=2011-07-22 }}. ''Journal of Health Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mending===
{{see also|Darning}}
When the raw material&amp;nbsp;– cloth&amp;nbsp;– was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous [[tailor]] or [[seamstress]] could mend rips with thread raveled from [[hem]]s and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace [[zipper]]s and [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] and sew up ripped hems.

===Recycling===
Used, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for [[quilt]]s, [[:wikt:rag|rags]], [[Carpet|rugs]], [[bandage]]s, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into [[paper]]. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a [[clothing bin]]). It is also sold to [[consignment shop]]s, dress agencies, [[flea market]]s, and in [[online auction]]s. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.  Globally, used clothes are worth $4 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Minter|first1=Adam|title=No One Wants Your Used Clothes Anymore|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-15/no-one-wants-your-used-clothes-anymore|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=[[Bloomberg News#Bloomberg View|Bloomberg View]]|date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the US as the leading exporter at $575 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Banigan|first1=Melissa|title=East Africa Doesn’t Want Your Hand-Me-Downs|url=https://www.racked.com/2018/1/25/16923226/east-africa-used-clothing-ban|accessdate=26 January 2018|work=Racked|publisher=[[Vox Media#Racked|Vox Media]]|date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colloquis''', previously known as ActiveBuddy and Conversagent, was a company that created conversation-based interactive agents originally distributed via [[instant messaging]] platforms. The company had offices in New York, NY and [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale, CA]].

Founded in 2000, the company was the brainchild of [[Robert Hoffer]], Timothy Kay and Peter Levitan. The idea for interactive agents (also known as [[Internet bots]]) came from the team's vision to add functionality to increasingly popular instant messaging services. The original implementation took shape as a word-based adventure game but quickly grew to include a wide range of database applications including access to news, weather, stock information, movie times, yellow pages listings, and detailed sports data, as well as a variety of tools (calculators, translator, etc.). These various applications were bundled into a single entity and launched as [[SmarterChild]] in 2001. SmarterChild acted as a showcase for the quick data access and possibilities for fun conversation that the company planned to turn into customized, niche specific products. 

The rapid success of SmarterChild led to targeted promotional products for Radiohead, Austin Powers, The Sporting News, and others. ActiveBuddy sought to strengthen its hold on the interactive agent market for the future by filing for, and receiving, a controversial&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/1446781 "Naraine, Ryan; “ActiveBuddy’s Patent Win Riles IM Bot Developers”; internetnews.com; August 15, 2002"]&lt;/ref&gt; patent on their creation in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|6430602}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also released the BuddyScript SDK, a free developer kit that allow programmers to design and launch their own interactive agents using ActiveBuddy’s [[proprietary programming language|proprietary scripting language]], in 2002. Ultimately, however, the decline in ad spending in 2001 and 2002 led to a shift in corporate strategy towards business focused Automated Service Agents, building products for clients including Cingular, Comcast and Cox Communications. The company subsequently changed its name from ActiveBuddy to Conversagent in 2003, and then again to Colloquis in 2006. Colloquis was later purchased by Microsoft in October 2006.

Most of the ActiveBuddy, Colloquis and Microsoft team that launched and nurtured SmarterChild is now working on AB2.

Many articles are written in English and specifically aimed at international audiences.

The portal was founded in March 2001. The project was initially conceived and designed by Andrzej Lubomirski, who also acted as editor-in-chief until 2008. Subsequent editors-in-chief have included Monika Rencławowicz (2008 – 2009), Elżbieta Sawicka (2009 – 2012), Weronika Kostyrko (2012 – 2016) and John Beauchamp (2016 – present).

The [[dead man's hand]], a legendary "cursed" [[poker]] hand usually depicted as consisting of the ace of spades, ace of clubs, eight of spades and eight of clubs with an undefined fifth card, has appeared or been referenced in numerous works of popular culture. 

==Written fiction==
In the novel ''[[Along Came a Spider (novel)|Along Came a Spider]]'' by [[James Patterson]], Jezzie Flannigan tells the story of how her father won his gun with a hand of aces and eights &amp;ndash; she also uses "Aces&amp;Eights" as her computer password. 

''Dead Man's Hand'' is the name of the seventh book of the "[[Wild Cards]]" series.

In "[[Batman R.I.P.]]", while [[Batman]] is talking to [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] in [[Arkham Asylum]], the Joker sends a cryptic message to Batman by dealing himself a "dead man's hand, with a twist." The "twist" is that the 8's in the hand are red cards, while the aces remain black. His final card is a Joker.

In ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' by [[Ken Kesey]], McMurphy has a dead man's hand tattooed on his shoulder, "a poker hand fanned out across his muscle - aces and eights".

The title of the fourth novel based on the film ''[[Final Destination]]'' is titled ''Dead Man's Hand'', and takes place in [[Las Vegas]]. Also, a comic mini-series based on the film used the "dead man's hand" as a means of foreshadowing.

There is a Las Vegas bar called the Nine of Diamonds in the novel ''[[Inherent Vice]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]], "out on Boulder Highway....According to Bigfoot Bjornsen, for whom this piece of western trivia had won him many a bar bet, the nine of diamonds had been the fifth card in Wild Bill Hickok's last poker hand, along with the black aces and eights."

==Film==
At least two of [[John Ford]]'s films feature the aces and eights hand as a foreshadowing of death. In ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939), the hand is held by Luke Plummer ([[Tom Tyler]]), soon to be shot by the Ringo Kid ([[John Wayne]]). In ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962), Liberty Valance draws the hand just prior to his death. 

In [[Anthony Mann]]'s film ''[[Winchester '73]]'', "Dutch" Henry lays down a [[List of poker hands#Full house|full house]], aces over eights, stating that he just missed a "dead man's hand."  

In the 1941 Western ''The Badlands of Dakota'', [[Wild Bill Hickok]], played by [[Richard Dix]], is shown to be holding the aces and eights "dead man's hand" after he has been shot in the back.  

In ''[[Along Came a Spider (film)|Along Came a Spider]]'' (2001), aces and eights is the winning hand that gave ownership of a Turkish hand-made shotgun to the father of Agent Flannigan. It later provides a clue about her involvement in the kidnapping plot.

A Dead Man's Hand is featured in the first part of the [[Coen Brothers]] anthology ''[[The Ballad of Buster Scruggs]]'', the titular character replaces a player in a poker game, and the other players insist he play the retired player's hand.  Buster, upon seeing the hand, prefers not to play it, suggesting to the viewer he is familiar with the implication of those cards.  Yet he's seen the hand, and the segment of the film begins with a picture entitled "You seen 'em, you play 'em."  Shortly thereafter, Buster is killed in a showdown.

==TV==
{{examplefarm|section|date=May 2014}}
On ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode entitled "[[Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose]]", the title character is playing poker with [[Agent Scully]] and is seen holding a full house of aces and eights (the ace of hearts being the fifth card).

In "The Assassin" (Season 3 Episode 11) of the television series ''[[The Pretender (TV_series)|The Pretender]]'', poker plays a key role, including the appearance of the dead man's hand at the end of the episode.

In a first episode of ''[[Quantum Leap]]'' ("How The Tess Was Won") a character attempts to rig a game of poker by dealing aces and eights to [[Sam_Beckett|Sam's]] love interest. It is referred to as a "dead man's hand" by [[Al_Calavicci|Al]].

In an episode of ''[[The Untouchables (1993 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' syndicated TV series (1993-1994), members of an Irish gang are playing poker when they are gunned down by members of an Italian mob.  A short time later, other members of the Irish gang come to investigate the scene of the demise of their unfortunate colleagues.  At one point, the leader of the investigating team examines the poker hand held by one of the deceased and comments matter-of-factly, "Aces and eights".

In [[Legends of the Hidden Temple]], an episode from the first season was told about the legend of [[Wild Bill Hicock]] and the Dead Man's Hand.

In "Noosphere Rising" (Season 1 Episode 7) of the television series ''[[Touch (2012 TV series)|Touch]]'', a key is given to Jake Bohm ([[David Mazouz]]) by Dr. Teller ([[Danny Glover]]) with the number 1188 engraved on it.  The number is identified by Martin Bohm ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]) as the "dead man's hand", and is part of the number pattern of the fictional Amelia Sequence.

In "The Lightning" (Season 1 Episode 14) of the television series ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', Hotch plays cards with a death row inmate, hoping to reveal the location of another victim. Hotch claims to have a pair of aces and a pair of eights, a dead man's hand, which the inmate believes is what he should have. The inmate shows a straight: 7 of spades, 8 of hearts, 9 of spades, 10 of hearts, jack of hearts. Hotch reveals he was hiding another ace, thus beating the inmate.

In June 2012, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] introduced a faction known as the "[[Aces &amp; Eights]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.impactwrestling.com/news/item/3657-IMPACT-WRESTLING-Coverage-Total-Nonstop-Anarchy-by-The-Aces-8s |title=Impact Wrestling Coverage: "Total Nonstop Anarchy" by The Aces &amp; 8s |accessdate=2012-07-23 |work=[[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723001913/http://www.impactwrestling.com/news/item/3657-IMPACT-WRESTLING-Coverage-Total-Nonstop-Anarchy-by-The-Aces-8s |archivedate=23 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The faction would use the Dead Man's Hand (black aces, black eights and the fifth card overturned) as a calling card for their attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/tnaimpact/article_63491.shtml|title=Caldwell's TNA Impact Wrestling results 7/19: Ongoing "virtual-time" coverage of live Impact - Open Fight Night, Aries vs. Roode|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2012-07-19|accessdate=2012-07-23|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One edition of the [[Fox News Channel]] documentary series ''[[Legends and Lies: The Real West]]'' presented a biography of Wild Bill Hickok, including – of course – a description of the "Dead Man’s Hand".

[[Paul Daniels]] incorporated the hand into a trick shown during series 6, episode 5 of his [[The_Paul_Daniels_Magic_Show|magic show]], first broadcast 22 September 1984.

The '''[[Saudi Arabia]]n national emblem''' ({{lang-ar|شعار السعودية}}) was adopted in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/sa.html#coa Flags of the World, Saudi Arabia page]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Basic Law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/sa00000_.html#A004_ Saudi Basic Law of Government, Article 4]&lt;/ref&gt; it consists of two crossed [[sword]]s with a [[Date palm|palm tree]] in the space above and between the blades. 

The two swords represent the [[Kingdom of Hejaz]] and the [[Sultanate of Nejd|Sultanate of Najd and its dependencies]], which were [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd|united]] under [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Ibn Saud]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flaggenlexikon.de/ Flaggenlexicon.de]&lt;/ref&gt; The palm tree represents the Kingdom's assets which are defined as its [[Saudi Arabian people|people]], [[Culture of Saudi Arabia|heritage]], [[History of Saudi Arabia|history]], and resources natural and non-natural. Thus, the palm is shown to be guarded by the two swords, which represent the force to be used in defence of the nation.

==Usage==
The Emblem appears on government documents, [[Diplomatic missions of Saudi Arabia|diplomatic missions]], as well as several Saudi Arabian flags. It is emblazoned in gold on the flag of the [[Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia]] (which is also the Kingdom's [[war ensign]]), and on the lower hoist of the [[Royal Standard]]. The latter is essentially the [[Flag of Saudi Arabia|national flag]] with the added Emblem in gold, which is placed in the lower part of the (left-facing) [[Hoist (flag)|hoist]] and not in the [[Canton (flag)|canton]] as with other royal standards. The Emblem's lower position is in deference to the sacred nature of the ''[[Shahada]]'', the [[Islam|Islamic]] [[creed]].

[[File:English Illustration - The Sixties p236.png|thumb|Illustration for "Enoch Arden" in ''[[The Leisure Hour]]'' (1864)]]
'''''Enoch Arden''''' is a [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] published in 1864 by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], during his tenure as England's [[poet laureate]]. The story on which it was based was provided to Tennyson by [[Thomas Woolner]].

== Background ==
[[File:George Goodwin Kilburne Enoch Arden.jpg|thumb|''Enoch Arden'' (watercolour painting by [[George Goodwin Kilburne]])]]
The hero of the poem, fisherman turned merchant sailor Enoch Arden, leaves his wife Annie and three children to go to sea with his old captain, who offers him work after he had lost his job due to an accident; in a manner that reflects the hero's masculine view of personal toil and hardship to support his family, Enoch Arden left his family to better serve them as a husband and father. However during his voyage, Enoch Arden is shipwrecked on a [[desert island]] with two companions; both eventually die, leaving Arden alone there. This part of the story is reminiscent of [[Robinson Crusoe]]. Enoch Arden remains lost and missing for more than ten years.

He finds upon his return from the sea that, after his long absence, his wife, who believed him dead, is married happily to another man, his childhood friend Philip (Annie has known both men since her childhood, thus the rivalry), and has a child by him. Enoch's life remains unfulfilled, with one of his children now dead, and his wife and remaining children now being cared for by his onetime rival.

Enoch never reveals to his wife and children that he is really alive, as he loves her too much to spoil her new happiness. Enoch dies of a [[broken heart]].

The story could be considered a variation on and antithesis to the classical myth of [[Odysseus]], who after an absence of 20 years at the [[Trojan War]] and at sea found a faithful wife who had been loyally waiting for him. The use of the name Enoch for a man who disappears from the lives of his loved ones is surely inspired by the biblical character [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]]. In fact also the entire chronological structure of the protagonist's life with its cycles related to the biblical symbolism of the "days of Creation" binds to the name of Enoch, as demonstrated by the analysis of an Italian thinker long interested in this work,{{r|umpaZ}} and denotes the impressive ability of Tennyson to insert theological intentions into simple elegiac mode with an unprecedented complexity in English literature.{{r|hr22G}}

== Musical settings ==
In 1897, [[Richard Strauss]] set the poem as a [[Enoch Arden (Strauss)|recitation for speaker and piano]], published as his Op. 38. On 24 May 1962, [[Columbia Records]] released a recording of Enoch Arden (recorded 2–4 October 1961) with [[Glenn Gould]] on the piano and [[Claude Rains]] as the speaker. The LP was made at a cost of $1500 and only 2000 copies were released. It remains a collector's item.{{r|gkpWh}}{{r|1D3Ti}} In 2010, Chad Bowles and David Ripley released a CD.

Gender binary is one general type of a [[gender systems|gender system]]. Sometimes in this binary model, "sex", "gender" and "sexuality" are assumed by default to align. For example, when a male is born, gender binarism assumes the male will be masculine in appearance, character traits, and behavior, including having a [[heterosexual]] attraction to females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keating |first1=Anne |title=glbtq &gt;&gt; literature &gt;&gt; Gender |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/gender.html |website=www.glbtq.com |publisher=glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture |accessdate=2 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403155153/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/gender.html |archivedate=3 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''gender binary'' describes the system in which a society splits its members into one of two sets of [[gender role]]s, [[gender identity|gender identities]] and attributes based on the shape of genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64453299|title=Gendered bodies : feminist perspectives|last=Judith.|first=Lorber,|date=2007|publisher=Roxbury Pub. Co|others=Moore, Lisa Jean, 1967-|year=|isbn=1933220414|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|pages=2|oclc=64453299}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of people born with organs that fall outside this system ([[intersex]] people), enforcement of the binary often includes coercive surgical gender reassignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Fausto-Sterling|first1=Anne|title=The Five Sexes, Revisited|journal=The Sciences|volume=40|issue=4|pages=18–23|publisher=New York Academy of Sciences|doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.2000.tb03504.x|pmid=12569934|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fausto-Sterling|first1=Anne|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|date=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c3lhYfZzIXkC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=anne+fausto+sterling#v=onepage&amp;q=anne%20fausto%20sterling&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 November 2016|isbn=9780465077144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender roles are a major aspect of the gender binary. Gender roles shape and constrain people's life experiences, impacting aspects of self-expression ranging from clothing choices to occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/style/sc-cons-0728-less-gendered-clothing-20160727-story.html|title=Breaking down the gender stereotypes in kids clothing|last=D'Innocenzio|first=Anne|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/799022013|title=World development report 2012 : Gender equality and development|last=Bank.|first=World|date=2011-01-01|publisher=World Bank|isbn=9780821388129|oclc=799022013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional gender roles continue to be enforced by the media, religion, mainstream education, political and other cultural and social systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Joy|last2=Repta|first2=Robin|title=Sex and Gender: Beyond the Binaries|journal=Designing and conducting gender, sex, &amp; health research|date=2002|pages=17–39|url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40428_Chapter2.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major religions such as [[Islam]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], in particular, act as authorities for gender roles. Islam, for example, teaches that mothers are the primary care givers to their children and Catholics only allow [[cisgender]] men to serve as priests.

Worldwide, there are many individuals and even several subcultures that can be considered exceptions to the gender binary or specific [[transgender]] identities. In addition to individuals whose bodies are naturally [[intersex]], there are also specific social roles that involve aspects of both or neither of the binary genders. These include the [[Two-Spirit]]ed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] of [[India]]. In the contemporary [[Western world|West]], [[genderqueer]] people break the gender binary by refusing terms like "male" and "female". [[Transgender]] people have a unique place in relation to the gender binary. In some cases, their gender expression aligns with their sex. Attempting to conform to societal expectations for their gender, transsexual individuals may opt for surgery, hormones, or both, which can be difficult if the individual does not "pass" as [[cisgender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

According to Thomas Keith in ''Masculinities in Contemporary American Culture'', the longstanding cultural assumption that male–female dualities are "natural and immutable" partly explains the persistence of systems of [[patriarchy]] and [[male privilege]] in modern society.&lt;ref name="Keith"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keith |first1=Thomas |title=Masculinities in Contemporary American Culture: An Intersectional Approach to the Complexities and Challenges of Male Identity |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-31-759534-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_niDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30&amp;dq=binary+%22patriarchy+and+male+privilege%22 |page=2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Some feminist scholars have contested the existence of a clear gender binary. [[Judith Lorber]] explains the problem of failing to question dividing people into these two groups “even though they often find more significant within-group differences than between-group differences.”&lt;ref name="lorber"&gt;Lorber, Judith. "Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology." In ''The Gendered Society Reader,'' edited by Michael S. Kimmel, Amy Aronson, and Amy Kaler, 11-18. Toronto, ON: Oxford University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber argues that this corroborates the fact that the gender binary is arbitrary and leads to false expectations of both men and women. Instead, there is growing support for the possibility of utilizing additional categories that compare people without "prior assumptions about who is like whom".&lt;ref name="lorber"/&gt; By allowing for a more fluid approach to gender, people will be able to better identify themselves however they choose and scholarly research will find different similarities and differences.{{Ambiguous|date=March 2017}}

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] suggests a classification of 23 sexes and a move away from the socially constructed gender binary classification of male and female. In her paper "The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough", she discusses the existence of intersex people, individuals possessing a combination of male and female sexual characteristics, who are seen as deviations from the norm and who frequently undergo coercive surgery at a very young age in order to maintain the two-gender system. The existence of these individuals challenges the standards of gender binaries and put into question society's role in constructing gender.&lt;ref name="Drowninginlimbo"&gt;{{cite book | author = Morgan Holmes | title = Intersex: A Perilous Difference

The '''Getty Villa''' is one of two locations of the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]. Located at the easterly end of the Malibu coast in the [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles, California]], United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About the Museum (Getty Museum)|url = http://www.getty.edu/museum/about.html|website = www.getty.edu|access-date = 2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Getty Villa is an educational center and museum dedicated to the study of the arts and [[Greco-Roman culture|cultures]] of [[ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and [[Etruria]]. The collection has 44,000 Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities dating from 6,500&amp;nbsp;BC to 400&amp;nbsp;AD, including the [[Lansdowne Heracles]] and the [[Victorious Youth]]. The UCLA/Getty Master's Program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation is housed on this campus. The collection is documented and presented through the online GettyGuide as well as through audio tours.

==History==
[[File:060807-005-GettyVilla004entrance.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to the Getty Villa sets the tone of entering an archaeological dig.]]

In 1954, oil tycoon [[J. Paul Getty]] opened a gallery adjacent to his home in Pacific Palisades.&lt;ref&gt;Storrie at p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/visit/see_do/architecture.html|title=Architecture|publisher=Getty Trust|access-date=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewiston/&gt;  Quickly running out of room, he built a second museum, the Getty Villa, on the property down the hill from the original gallery.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;&lt;ref name=sd&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2011/feb/11/travel-getty-center-and-getty-villa/|title=The Getty Center and the Getty Villa|work=San Diego Reader|first=Derek |last=Ray|date=February 11, 2011|access-date=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The villa design was inspired by the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]]&lt;ref name=sd/&gt; and incorporated additional details from several other ancient sites. It was designed by architects [[Robert E. Langdon, Jr.]], and [[Ernest C. Wilson, Jr.]], in consultation with archeologist Norman Neuerburg.&lt;ref&gt;Myrna Oliver, [http://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/25/local/me-langdon25 Robert Langdon Jr., 86; Designed 1st Getty Museum], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', August 25, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arch.usc.edu/news/grad-student-unearths-architect%E2%80%99s-drawings-getty-exhibition Grad student unearths architect’s drawings for Getty exhibition], USC School of Architecture: School News, July 05, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in 1974,&lt;ref name=molt155&gt;Moltesen at p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; but was never visited by Getty, who died in 1976.&lt;ref name=Lewiston&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=soggAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r2UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3053,1344563&amp;dq=getty+museum&amp;hl=en|title=Getty Never Saw Fabulous Museum|first=Cricket|last=Bird|date=June 10, 1976|access-date=2011-03-08|page=10|work=Lewiston [Maine] Evening Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, the museum inherited $661 million&lt;ref name=Lenzner&gt;Lenzner, Robert. ''The great Getty: the life and loves of J. Paul Getty, richest man in the world''. New York: Crown Publishers, 1985. {{ISBN|0-517-56222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began planning a much larger campus, the [[Getty Center]], in nearby [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]]. The museum overcame neighborhood opposition to its new campus plan by agreeing to limit the total size of the development on the Getty Center site.&lt;ref name=filler215&gt;Filler at 215.&lt;/ref&gt;  To meet the museum's total space needs, the museum decided to split between the two locations with the Getty Villa housing the [[Greek culture|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] antiquities.&lt;ref name=filler215/&gt; In 1993, the Getty Trust selected Rodolpho Machado and Jorge Silvetti to design the renovation of the Getty Villa and its campus.&lt;ref name=filler215/&gt; In 1997, portions of the museum's collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities were moved to the Getty Center for display, and the Getty Villa was closed for renovation.&lt;ref name=die/&gt;  The collection was restored during the renovation.&lt;ref name=molt155/&gt;

Starting in 2004, the museum and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) hold summer institutes in Turkey, studying the conservation of Middle Eastern Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.ucla.edu/news/article.asp?parentid=14945 |title=UCLA and Getty Museum Hold Summer Institute in Turkey |publisher=UCLA |date=2004-09-23 |access-date=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720072945/http://international.ucla.edu/news/article.asp?parentid=14945 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reopened on January&amp;nbsp;28,&amp;nbsp;2006, the Getty Villa shows Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities within Roman-inspired architecture and surrounded by Roman-style gardens.&lt;ref name=molt157&gt;Moltesen at 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  The art is arranged by themes, e.g., ''Gods and Goddesses'', ''[[Dionysos]] and the Theater'',  and ''Stories of the [[Trojan War]]''.&lt;ref name=molt157/&gt; The new [[architectural plan]] surrounding the Villa – which was conceived by Boston architects [[Machado and Silvetti Associates]] (who were also responsible for the plans for the renovated museum) – is designed to simulate an archaeological dig. ''[[Architectural Record]]'' has praised their work on the Getty Villa as "a near miracle – a museum that elicits no smirks from the art world ... a masterful job ... crafting a sophisticated ensemble of buildings, plazas, and landscaping that finally provides a real home for a relic of another time and place."&lt;ref name='Architectural Record 2006-05'&gt;{{cite news | first = Clifford A. | last = Pearson | title = Machado and Silvetti creates an elaborate new setting that shows off the renovated Getty Villa without irony or apologies | date = May 2006 | publisher = The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. | url = http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/portfolio/archives/0605getty.asp | work = [[Archit.

In 2016–18 the collection was reinstalled in a chronological arrangement emphasizing art-historical themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/a-new-vision-for-the-collection-at-the-getty-villa/ |title=A New Vision for the Collection at the Getty Villa |last=Potts |first=Timothy |date=April 2, 2018 |website=The Getty Iris |publisher=J. Paul Getty Trust |access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been controversy surrounding the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Italy|Italian]] governments' claim that objects in the collection were [[Looted art|looted]] and should be [[Art repatriation|repatriated]].&lt;ref name=seattle/&gt; In 2006, the Getty returned or promised to return four looted objects to Greece: a [[stele]] (grave marker), a marble relief, a gold funerary wreath, and a marble statue.&lt;ref&gt;Carassava, Anthee.

==Facility and programs==

Admission to the Getty Villa is free, but timed tickets must be obtained in advance via phone or the museum's website.   As of June 2010, there is a $15.00 charge for parking during the day, but parking is free for evening performances. The museum is open Wednesday to Monday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. It is closed Tuesday and on [[New Year's Day]] (January&amp;nbsp;1), [[Independence Day (United States)|July&amp;nbsp;4]], [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]] (December&amp;nbsp;25).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/visit/hours/|title=Hours, Directions, Parking|publisher=Getty Trust|access-date=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Getty Villa hosts live performances in both its indoor auditorium and its outdoor theatre.  Indoor play-readings included ''The Trojan Women,'' Aristophanes' ''The Frogs,'' and Euripides' ''Helen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/museum/programs/performances/playreading_series.html|title=Villa Play–Reading Series|publisher=Getty Trust|access-date=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indoor musical performances, which typically relate to art exhibits, included: Musica Angelica, De Organographia, and Songs from the Fifth Age: Sones de México in Concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/museum/programs/performances/villa_concerts.html|title=Concerts at the Villa|publisher=Getty Trust|access-date=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auditorium also held a public reading of Homer's ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/museum/programs/performances/the_iliad.html|title=Public Reading of Homer's Iliad|publisher=Getty Trust|access-date=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor performances included Aristophanes' ''Peace'', Aeschylus's ''Agamemnon'', and Sophocles' ''Elektra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/museum/programs/performances/outdoor_theater.html|title=Getty Villa Outdoor Theater Production|publisher=Getty Trust|access-date=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Getty Villa also hosts visiting exhibitions beyond its own collections. For example, in March 2011 "In Search of Biblical Lands" was a photographic exhibition which included scenes of the Middle East dating back to the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/picks_clicks/article/calendar_picks_and_clicks_march_1march_11_2011_20110301/|title=Calendar Picks and Clicks|work=Jewish Journaldate=March 1, 2011|access-date=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Getty Villa offers special educational programs for children. A special Family Forum gallery offers activities including decorating Greek vases and projecting shadows onto a screen that represents a Greek urn.  The room also has polystyrene props from Greek and Roman culture for children to handle and use to cast shadows.  The Getty Villa also offers children's guides to the other exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/education/kids_families/programs/family_forum.html|title=Family Forum|publisher=Getty Trust|access-date=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=molt156&gt;Moltesen at p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Getty Conservation Institute offers a Master's Program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation in association with the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA. Classes and research are conducted in the museum wing of the ranch house. The program was the first of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/news/press/getty_villa_2008/gvpk01_general_08.pdf|title=Getty Villa Press Kit|publisher=Getty Trust|access-date=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the west of the Outer Peristyle is an herb garden. Beneath the Outer Peristyle is the Central Parking Garage. To the west of the Museum is a 450-seat outdoor Greek theater where evening performances are staged, named in honor of Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman.&lt;ref name=fs/&gt; The theater faces the west side of the Villa and uses its entrance as a stage.&lt;ref name=filler221&gt;Filler at p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; To the northwest of the theatre is a three-story, {{convert|15500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building built into the hill that contains the museum store on the lower level, a cafe on the second level, and a private dining room on the top level.&lt;ref&gt;Filler at p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;  North of the Villa is a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} indoor 250 seat auditorium.&lt;ref name=fs/&gt; On the hill above the museum are Getty's original private ranch house and the museum wing that Getty added to his home in 1954.

Architectural critic Calum Storrie describes the overall effect:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What the Getty Villa achieves, first by seclusion, then by control of access, and ultimately through the architecture, is a sense of detachment from its immediate environment.&lt;ref&gt;Storrie at p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Greco-Roman world''', '''Greco-Roman culture''', or the term '''''Greco-Roman''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɡ|r|i|k|oʊ|ˈ|r|oʊ|m|ən}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɡ|r|ɛ|k|oʊ|ˈ|r|oʊ|m|ən}}); spelled '''Graeco-Roman''' in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]), when used as an adjective, as understood by modern scholars and writers, refers to those geographical regions and countries that culturally (and so historically) were directly, long-term, and intimately influenced by the language, culture, government and religion of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. It is also better known as the [[Classical Civilisation]]. In exact terms the area refers to the "[[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean world]]", the extensive tracts of land centered on the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]] basins, the "swimming-pool and spa" of the Greeks and Romans, i.e. one wherein the cultural perceptions, ideas and sensitivities of these peoples were dominant.

This process was aided by the universal adoption of [[Greek language|Greek]] as the language of intellectual culture and commerce in the Eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]], and of [[Latin]] as the tongue for public management and forensic advocacy, especially in the Western Mediterranean.

Though the Greek and the Latin never became the native idioms of the rural peasants who composed the great majority of the empire's population, they were the languages of the [[Urban area|urban]]ites and [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] [[elites]], and the [[lingua franca]], even if only as corrupt or multifarious dialects to those who lived within the large territories and populations outside the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)#Empire|Macedonian settlements]] and the [[Colonies in antiquity#Roman colonies|Roman colonies]]. All Roman citizens of note and accomplishment regardless of their ethnic extractions, spoke and wrote in Greek and/or Latin, such as the Roman jurist and Imperial chancellor [[Ulpian]] who was of [[Phoenicia]]n origin, the mathematician and geographer [[Claudius Ptolemy]] who was of Greco-Egyptian origin and the famous post-Constantinian thinkers [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] who were of Syrian and [[Berber people|Berber]] origins, respectively, and the historian [[Josephus Flavius]] who was of [[Jews|Jewish]] origin and spoke and wrote in Greek.

==Cores/Domains of the Greco-Roman world==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
[[File:Culture of Antiquity.png|thumb|upright=2.05|A map of the ancient world, centred on Greece.]]

Based on the above definition, it can be confidently asserted that the "cores" of the Greco-Roman world were  [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Asia Minor]] (roughly corresponds to modern [[Turkey]]), [[Gaul]] (modern France), [[Greater Syria]], [[Egypt]] and [[Africa]] Proper ([[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]]). Occupying the periphery of this world were "Roman Germany" (the Alpine countries and the so-called [[Agri Decumates]], the territory between the [[Main (river)|Main]], the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]]), [[Illyria]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Odrysian kingdom|Thrace]] (roughly corresponds to modern [[Bulgaria]]), [[Moesia]] (roughly corresponds to modern northern [[Bulgaria]]), and [[Pannonia]] (the former [[Yugoslavia]], and [[Albania]], and [[Hungary]]).

Also included was [[Dacia]] (roughly corresponds to modern [[Romania]]), [[Nubia]] (roughly corresponds to modern northern [[Sudan]]), [[Mauretania]] (modern [[Morocco]] and western [[Algeria]]), [[Arabia Petraea]] (the [[Hejaz]] and [[Jordan]], with modern Egypt's [[Sinai Peninsula]]), the Tauric Chersonesus (modern [[Crimea]] in [[Ukraine]]).

The above seems to ignore the major rivalry between the Greco-Romans, during their period of ascendancy, and the great empire to the east, the Persians. See [[Xenophon]], [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|The Anabasis]], or, the March Up Country, the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Greco-Persian wars]], the famous battles of [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] and [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], the Greek tragedy "[[The Persians]]" by [[Aeschylus]],  [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Battle of Gaugamela|defeat]] of the Persian emperor [[Darius III]] and conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian empire]], or, the later Roman generals' difficulties with the Persian armies, such as [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]], and of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] (conqueror of the slave general [[Spartacus]]), who was defeated in the field by a Persian force, and was beheaded by them. (Ref: Appian, The Civil Wars).

==Culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
In the schools of [[art]], [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]], the foundations of [[education]] were transmitted throughout the lands of Greek and Roman rule. Within its educated class spanning all of the "Greco-Roman" eras, the testimony of literary borrowings and influences is overwhelming proof of a mantle of mutual knowledge. For example, several hundred [[papyrus]] volumes found in a Roman villa at [[Herculaneum]] are in Greek. From the lives of [[Cicero]] and [[Julius Caesar]], it is known that Romans frequented the schools in Greece.

The installation, both in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], of [[Augustus]]'s monumental eulogy, the [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]], is a proof of official recognition for the dual vehicles of the common culture. The familiarity of figures from Roman legend and history in the "[[Parallel Lives]]" composed by [[Plutarch]] is one example of the extent to which "[[universal history]]" was then synonymous with the accomplishments of famous [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] and [[Names of the Greeks|Hellenes]]. Most educated Romans were likely bilingual in Greek and Latin.

== Architecture ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
"Greco-Roman" architecture is the architecture of the Roman world that followed the principles and style established in ancient Greece. The most representative building of that era was the temple. Other prominent structures that represented the style included government buildings, like the Roman Senate, and cultural structures, like the [[Colosseum]]. The three primary styles of column design used in temples in classical Greece were [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]] and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]. Some examples of Doric architecture are the [[Parthenon]] and the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in Athens, while the [[Erechtheion|Erechtheum]], which is located right next to the Parthenon is Ionic.

==Politics==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
{{confusing section|date=December 2010}}
}}
The Romans made it possible for individuals from subject peoples to acquire [[Roman citizenship]] and would sometimes confer citizenship on whole communities; thus, "Roman" became less and less an ethnic and more and more a political designation.

By AD 211, with [[Caracalla]]'s edict known as the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'', all free inhabitants of the Empire became citizens. As a result, even after the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Fall of Rome]], the people of the empire that remained (later referred to by many historians as the [[Byzantine Empire]]) continued to call themselves Romans even though Greek became the main language of the Empire. ''Rhomaioi'' is what they continued to call themselves (''Hellenes'' referring to pagan Greeks) through the Ottoman era and even into modern times.

A '''hairbrush''' is a stick [[brush]] with rigid or soft [[bristle]]s used in [[hair care]] for smoothing, styling, and detangling human [[hair]], or for grooming an animal's fur. It can also be used for styling in combination with a [[curling iron]] or [[hair dryer]].

==Human use==
[[File:Julienne Mathieu having her hair brushed.gif|thumb|[[Julienne Mathieu]]'s hair being brushed, then combed and styled in the 1908 film ''[[El hotel eléctrico]].'']]
A flat brush is normally used for detangling hair, for example after sleep or showering. A round brush can be used for styling and curling hair, especially by a professional [[hairdresser|stylist]], often with a [[hair dryer]]. A paddle brush is used to [[straighten hair]] and tame fly-aways. For babies with fine, soft hair, many bristle materials are not suitable due to the hardness; some synthetic materials and [[horse]]/[[goat]] hair bristles are used instead.

==Animal use==
Special brushes are made for cats and dogs. Two different brushes can be made specifically for either short haired pets, or long haired pets. For an [[horse|equine]]'s tougher hair, a [[curry-comb]] is used.

==Types==

|image2    = Roundhairbrush.JPG
|caption2  = A round hairbrush is sometimes used to style medium length hair with a [[blowdryer]].
}}

Various types of brushes are used for different purposes, or have special features that are beneficial to certain hair types. For example:

* Round brush: Usually used with a blow dryer to add fullness and movement to the hair. Some have a metal or ceramic base which is designed to heat up during blow drying.&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;{{cite web |website=Mandy McCullough |title=Hair Brush 101 – What You Need to Know |date=August 27, 2013 |url=https://mandymccullough.com/2013/08/27/hair-brush-101-what-you-need-to-know/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vent brush: Vents allow more air flow between the bristles but does not affect the drying time.&lt;ref name="mm" /&gt;
* Cushion brush: Bristles are mounted on a rubber cushion or mat for added flexibility, to minimize hair breakage during detangling. Denman manufactures a popular line of cushion brushes.&lt;ref name="mm" /&gt;
* Paddle brush: A wide base allows more exposure while blow drying; flexible teeth are designed to minimize breakage, though some believe it does not work..&lt;ref name="mm" /&gt;
* Detangler brush: Features such as widely spaced, flexible, nylon teeth are designed to be gentle on tangled or knotted hair.&lt;ref name="mm" /&gt;
* Boar bristle brush: Tightly spaced boar-hair bristles are designed to increase tension while brushing, to smooth the hair.&lt;ref name="mm" /&gt;

The effects of brushing will be different depending  texture and whether the hair is wet or dry. Straight hair typically looks smoother when brushed. Curly hair tends to expand when brushed while dry. Which makes straight hair easier to work with.

===Materials===
Common materials used for the handle are [[ebony]], [[rosewood]], [[New Guinea rosewood]], [[beech]], [[ABS plastic]] and [[polyacetal]]. Common materials used for bristles include [[boar bristle]], [[horsehair]], [[nylon]], [[stainless steel]] and [[goat]] hair.

The [[hippie]] [[subculture]] began its development as a [[youth movement]] in the United States during the early 1960s and then developed around the world.

Its origins may  be traced to European social movements in the 19th and early 20th century such as [[Bohemianism|Bohemians]], and the influence of [[Eastern religion]] and spirituality. From around 1967, its fundamental ethos — including harmony with nature, communal living, artistic experimentation particularly in music, and the widespread use of recreational drugs — spread around the world during the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], which has become closely associated with the subculture.

==Precursors==
{{main|Counterculture|Flappers}}

===Classical culture===
The Hippie movement has found historical precedents as far back as the [[Mazdak]]ist movement in [[Persia]], whose leader the Persian reformer Mazdak, advocated communal living, the sharing of resources, [[vegetarianism]] and [[free love]].&lt;ref&gt;Crone, Patrician , "Kavad's Heresy and Mazdak's Revolt", in: Iran 29 (1991), S. 21–40.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1967 article in ''Time Magazine'' asserted that the hippie movement has a historical precedent in the counterculture of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], espoused by philosophers like [[Diogenes of Sinope]] and the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]s.&lt;ref name="Time_1968"&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate =2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article also claimed that the hippies were influenced by the ideals  of [[Jesus Christ]], [[Hillel the Elder]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[St. Francis of Assisi]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Gandhi]], and others.&lt;ref name="Time_1968" /&gt; Some{{Who|date=July 2010}} have pointed to the short-lived Merrymount colony in 1625 (allegorically portrayed by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] in "[[The Maypole of Merry Mount]])" as the first hippie experience on the American continent.

=== 19th- and early 20th-century Europe ===
{{Main|Lebensreform}}

In the late 1800s and early 1900s the German ''[[Lebensreform]]'' movement emphasized the goodness of nature, the harms to society, people, and to nature caused by industrialization, the importance of the whole person, body and mind, and the goodness of "the old ways".&lt;ref name=Williams2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=John Alexander|title=Turning to nature in Germany : hiking, nudism, and conservation, 1900-1940|date=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=9780804700153|pages=23–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGemAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hakl|first1=Hans Thomas|last2=McIntosh|first2=Christopher|title=Eranos: An Alternative Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317548133|page=272|quote=How can we explain the convergence of conservative-[[Völkisch movement|volkisch]] currents with the Lebensreform faction, the ecology movement,(103) early women's liberation and the opening to alternative forms of religion—a convergence that seems so surprising from todays perspective? A deep emotional chord is struck by the themes of one's own [[Volk]], of peace-giving religion, of the local soil that demands such careful nurturing, of one's own mother, indeed of the "feminine" in general. This chord vibrates again and again in the same register, which can best be characterized by the German word Geborgenheit, implying a reassuring sense of security against that which is new and strange.   Footnote 103: The ecology movement, which today tends to be seen as belonging to the left, had its origins in the Lebensreforrn groups of around the turn of the twentieth century, which were often marked by "volkisch" thinking and were influenced by the Wandervogel (wandering birds) movement.

=== Nature Boys of Southern California ===
During the first several decades of the 20th century, these beliefs were introduced to the United States as [[German Americans|Germans settled around the country]], some opening the first [[health food store]]s. (For example, [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]'s first health food store was opened in 1934 by [[Hermann Sexauer]], who was born in [[Teningen]], Germany on 4 March 1883 and died in December 1971; he left Germany in 1906, arrived in New York, ended up in California and lived a [[pacifist]], [[raw vegan]], non-conformist lifestyle.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunfood.net/straight-edge.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many moved to Southern California, where they could practice an alternative lifestyle in a warm climate. In turn, young Americans adopted the beliefs and practices of the new immigrants. One group, called the Nature Boys, who included [[William Pester]], took to the California desert, raised organic food, and espoused a back-to-nature lifestyle. [[eden ahbez]], a member of this group, wrote a hit song, "[[Nature Boy]]'", which was recorded in 1947 by [[Nat King Cole]], popularizing the homegrown back-to-nature movement to mainstream America. Eventually, a few of these Nature Boys, including the famous [[Gypsy Boots]], made their way to Northern California in 1967, just in time for the [[Summer of Love]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;The psychedelic posters that announced concerts at the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] and other San Francisco venues were heavily influenced by the artist [[Fidus]], one of the original German hippies. For more about the influence of the Germans on America's hippies, see Kennedy and Ryan above.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beat Generation ===
The [[Beat Generation]], especially those associated with the [[San Francisco Renaissance]], gradually gave way to the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s era counterculture]], accompanied by a shift in terminology from "beatnik" to "[[freak scene|freak]]" and "hippie". Many of the original Beats remained active participants, notably [[Allen Ginsberg]], who became a fixture of the anti-war movement. On the other hand, [[Jack Kerouac]] broke with Ginsberg and criticized the 1960s protest movements as an "excuse for spitefulness". [[Bob Dylan]] became close friends with Allen Ginsberg, and Ginsberg became close friends with [[Timothy Leary]]. Both Leary and Ginsberg were introduced to [[LSD]] by [[Michael Hollingshead]] in the early 1960s, and both became instrumental in popularizing psychedelic substances to the hippie movement.

In 1963, Ginsberg was living in San Francisco with [[Neal Cassady]] and [[Charles Plymell]].&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Cassady, and Plymell were at 1403 Gough St in 1963. A few years later, Charles Plymell helped publish the first issue of [[Robert Crumb|R. Crumb]]'s ''[[Zap Comix]]'', then moved to Ginsberg's commune in [[Cherry Valley (village), New York|Cherry Valley, NY]], in the early 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Ginsberg connected with [[Ken Kesey]], who was participating in [[CIA]] sponsored [[MKULTRA|LSD trials]], at the [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] Veterans' Hospital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paloalto.va.gov/locations/menlopark.asp|title=Menlo Park Division – VA Palo Alto Health Care System|author=VA Palo Alto Health Care System|work=va.gov|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked as a night aide.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Edward C.

According to [[Ed Sanders]], the change in the public label from "beatnik" to "hippie" occurred after the 1967 [[Human Be-In]] in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, where Ginsberg, [[Gary Snyder]], and [[Michael McClure]] led the crowd in chanting "Om". Ginsberg was also at the infamous [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], and was friends with [[Abbie Hoffman]] and other members of the [[Chicago Seven]]. Stylistic differences between beatniks, marked by somber colors, dark shades and goatees, gave way to colorful psychedelic clothing and long hair worn by hippies. While the beats were known for "playing it cool" and keeping a low profile, hippies became known for  displaying their individuality.

One early book hailed as evidencing the transition from "beatnik" to "hippie" culture, was ''[[Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me]]'' by [[Richard Fariña]], brother-in-law of [[Joan Baez]]. Written in 1963, it was published April 28, 1966—two days before its author was killed in a motorcycle crash.

== 1960 to 1966 ==

===Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters===
The [[Merry Pranksters]] were a group who originally formed around [[United States|American]] [[novelist]] [[Ken Kesey]], considered one of the most prominent figures in the psychedelic movement, and sometimes lived communally at his homes in California and Oregon. Notable members include Kesey's best friend [[Ken Babbs]], [[Neal Cassady]], [[Carolyn Garcia|Mountain Girl]] (born Carolyn Adams but best known as Mrs. Jerry Garcia), [[Wavy Gravy]], [[Paul Krassner]], [[Stewart Brand]], [[Del Close]], [[Paul Foster (cartoonist)|Paul Foster]], George Walker, and others. Their early escapades were chronicled by [[Tom Wolfe]] in ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]''.

Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters are remembered chiefly for the sociological significance of a lengthy roadtrip they took in 1964, traveling across the [[United States]] in a [[psychedelia|psychedelically]] painted school [[bus]] enigmatically labeled [[Further (bus)|Further]], and for the "Acid Tests". Kesey believed that psychedelics were best used as a tool for transforming society as a whole, and believed that if a sufficient percentage of the population had the psychedelic experience then revolutionary social and political changes would occur. Therefore, they made LSD available to anyone interested in partaking - most famously through the "electric kool-aid" made available at a series of "Acid Tests"; musical and multi-media events where participants were given "acid", the street name for LSD. The tests were held at various venues in California, and were sometimes advertised with colorful crayoned signs asking "Can you pass the acid test?" The first Acid Test was held in [[Palo Alto, California]] in November 1965. (LSD was legal in the United States until October 6, 1966.) The young [[psychedelic music]] band the [[Grateful Dead]] supplied the music during these events.

===Red Dog Experience===
{{Main|Red Dog Experience}}
[[Red Dog Saloon (Virginia City, Nevada)|The Red Dog Saloon]] was a bar and music venue located in the isolated, old-time mining town of [[Virginia City, Nevada]]. In April 1963, Chandler A. Laughlin III established a kind of tribal, family identity among approximately 50 people who attended a traditional, all-night [[peyote]] ceremony which combined a psychedelic experience with traditional [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] spiritual values.&lt;ref name="Works"&gt;{{cite video | people=Works, Mary | title=Rockin' At the Red Dog: The Dawn of Psychedelic Rock | medium=DVD | publisher=Monterey Video |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1965, Laughlin recruited much of the original talent that led to a unique amalgam of traditional folk music and the developing psychedelic rock scene.&lt;ref name="Works" /&gt; He and his cohorts created what became known as The Red Dog Experience, featuring previously unknown musical acts - [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[The Charlatans (U.S. band)|The Charlatans]], [[Grateful Dead]] and others. There was no clear delineation between "performers" and "audience" and the music, psychedelic experimentation, unique sense of personal style, and Bill Ham's first primitive light shows combined to create a new sense of community.&lt;ref name="Ham" /&gt;

===Anti-war protests===
{{Main|Opposition to the Vietnam War}}
Although there were many diverse groups and elements protesting the US military involvement in Vietnam as it began to escalate, many of the protesters, rightly or wrongly, came to be associated with aspects of the "hippie" movement in the popular view. A number of them had been highly active in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the first half of the 1960s, traveling across the country to take part in sit-ins and marches against [[racial segregation|segregation]] in the South. The first [[draft card burning]]s took place May 12, 1964, in New York City. Others followed, including more draft-card burnings in May 1965 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (which had already seen a precedent to the subsequent social turmoil, in form of the [[Free Speech Movement]]), and a coffin was marched to the Berkeley draft board. As similar protests continued through the summer, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] responded by signing a new law on August 31, 1965, penalizing the burning of draft cards with up to 5 years in prison and a $1,000 fine, although such burnings went on regardless. In later years, the [[Viet Cong]] flag of the "enemy" was even adopted as a symbol by more radical anti-war protesters. However, the core "hippie" philosophy remained staunchly aloof to politics, and politicians, throughout this time.

===Generation===
The new "hippie" values, e.g. [[natural childbirth]], made an early Broadway appearance October 6, 1965, with the opening of a popular new play, ''Generation'' by US playwright William Goodhart, starring [[Henry Fonda]] (as Jim Bolton), which, according to one of its reviews in ''Time'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,834534,00.html|title=Television: Nov. 12, 1965|date=November 12, 1965|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "converts a [[Greenwich Village]] loft into a sparring ground for [[the Establishment]] and the hippie, the parent and the child."  Owing to the success of this play, it went on to be made into a 1969 film, entitled ''Generation'' (also released under the title ''A Time for Giving and A Time for Caring'') with [[David Janssen]] in the role of Jim Bolton (also featuring [[Kim Darby]], [[Carl Reiner]], [[James Coco]] and [[Sam Waterston]]).

===Underground press===
Another signal of the rising movement was the sudden appearance of an underground hippie press in several US cities.  Among the first of these was the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'', which began in May 1964 as a broadside entitled ''The Faire Free Press''. This was soon followed by the ''[[Berkeley Barb]]'' in August 1965, the ''[[East Village Other]]'' of New York, in October 1965, ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|The Fifth Estate]]'', in Detroit in November 1965, and [[East Lansing]]'s ''The Paper'' in December 1965. By 1966 the Underground Press Syndicate had been organized; 80 presses of U.S. and Canada came to a conference sponsored by [[Middle Earth (newspaper)|Middle Earth]] in Iowa City. Liberation News Service, located in Washington DC, then New York, then split between New York and a commune in rural Massachusetts, served up alternative stories to the underground press world.

===Psychedelic rock===

'''A Tribute to Dr. Strange'''

When they returned to San Francisco at the end of Summer 1965, Red Dog participants Luria Castell, Ellen Harman and Alton Kelley created a collective called "The Family Dog".&lt;ref name="Works"/&gt; Modeled on their Red Dog experiences, on October 16, 1965, The Family Dog hosted "A Tribute to [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]]" at Longshoreman's Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Two other events followed before year's end, one at California Hall and one at the Matrix.&lt;ref name="Works" /&gt;

'''Trips Festival'''

A much larger psychedelic event, "The [[Trips Festival]]", took place on January 21–23, 1966, at Longshoreman's Hall, organized by [[Stewart Brand]], [[Ken Kesey]], [[Owsley Stanley]], Zach Stewart and others.  Ten thousand people attended this sold-out event, with a thousand more turned away each night.&lt;ref&gt;Tamony, 1981, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; On Saturday January 22, the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] came on stage, and 6,000 people arrived to imbibe punch spiked with LSD and to witness one of the first fully developed light shows of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pranksterweb.org/trips.htm,|title=Welcome to the Trips Festival Page – Prankster History Project|website=www.pranksterweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fillmore Auditorium and Avalon Ballroom'''

By February 1966, the Family Dog became [[Chet Helms#Family Dog Productions|Family Dog Productions]] under organizer [[Chet Helms]], promoting happenings at the [[Avalon Ballroom]] and the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] in initial cooperation with [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]].  These and other venues provided settings where participants could partake in the full psychedelic music experience.

When San Francisco's Fox Theater went out of business, hippies bought up its costume stock, reveling in the freedom to dress up for weekly musical performances at their favorite ballrooms.  As ''San Francisco Chronicle'' music columnist [[Ralph J. Gleason]] put it, "They danced all night long, orgiastic, spontaneous and completely free form."&lt;ref name="Works" /&gt;

=== Haight-Ashbury ===
{{Main|Haight-Ashbury}} {{See also|History of San Francisco, California}}
Some of the earliest San Francisco hippies were former students at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]] (later renamed San Francisco State University) who were intrigued by the developing psychedelic hippie music scene and left school after they started taking psychedelic drugs.&lt;ref name="Works" /&gt; These students joined the bands they loved and began living communally in the large, inexpensive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] apartments in the Haight.&lt;ref name="Perry_2005_57"&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|2005|pp=5–7}}.  Perry writes that SFSC students rented cheap, Edwardian-Victorians in the Haight.&lt;/ref&gt;  Young Americans around the country began moving to San Francisco, and by June 1966, around 15,000 hippies had moved into the Haight.&lt;ref name="Tompkins_2001b_57"&gt;{{harvnb|Tompkins|2001b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Charlatans (U.S. band)|The Charlatans]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], and the [[Grateful Dead]] all moved to San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood during this period.

'''Love Pageant Rally'''

{{Main|Love Pageant Rally}}
On October 6, 1966, the state of California made LSD a controlled substance, making the drug illegal.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{Citation | last = Farber| first = David |author2=Beth L.

According to Cohen, those who took LSD were mostly idealistic people who wanted to learn more about themselves and their place in the universe, and they used LSD as an aid to meditation and to creative, artistic expression.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  The Grateful Dead played, and some sources claim that LSD was consumed at the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lee| first =  Martin A. |author2=Bruce Shlain | title = Acid Dreams  | publisher = Grove Press | year = 1985| page = 119 | isbn = 0-8021-3062-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mantra-Rock Dance'''

{{Main|Mantra-Rock Dance}}
One frequently encountered theme was Asian spirituality, and Zen, dharma, "nirvana", karma and yoga were "buzzwords" of the counterculture. For most this infatuation with Asia was somewhat superficial, limited to their wearing colourful and inexpensive clothing from India and burning Indian made incense. One more substantive event in this connection was The Mantra-Rock Dance, January 29, 1967. An audience of nearly 3,000 gathered at the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco, filling the hall to its capacity for a fundraising effort for the first [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] center on the West Coast of the United States. The Mantra-Rock Dance featured some of the most prominent Californian rock groups of the time, such as the Grateful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company. The bands performed for free and countercultural leaders boosted the event's popularity; among them were LSD promoters Timothy Leary and Augustus Owsley Stanley III. Poet Allen Ginsberg led the singing of the Hare Krishna mantra onstage along with the founder acarya of the Krishna Consciousness movement, [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]]. Strobe lights and a psychedelic liquid light show along with pictures of Krishna and the words of the Hare Krishna mantra were projected onto the walls of the venue. Later Ginsberg called the Mantra-Rock Dance "the height of Haight-Ashbury spiritual enthusiasm ..."

'''Diggers'''

{{Main|Diggers (theater)}}

{{quote|quote = It is nothing new. We have a private revolution going on. A revolution of individuality and diversity that can only be private.

Hippie action in the Haight centered on the Diggers, a guerrilla street [[theatre]] group that combined spontaneous street theatre, anarchistic action, and [[Happening|art happenings]] in their agenda to create a "free city". By late 1966, the Diggers opened [[Give-away shop|stores which simply gave away their stock]]; provided free food, medical care, transport and temporary housing; they also organized free music concerts and works of political art.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  The Diggers criticized the term 'hippie' with their October 1967, 'Death of Hippie' event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

The Death of Hippie event: In late September 1967, many of the shops in the district began to display a stack of 4x5 cards on their counters proclaiming "Funeral Notice for Hippie". "Friends are invited to attend services beginning at sunrise, October 6, 1967, at Buena Vista Park". An organization known as the [[Haight Ashbury Switchboard]] actively supported the Digger's funeral concept. A funeral procession went from the park down Haight St and ended in the Panhandle with supporters carrying a trinket filled casket. It was emblematic of the fate of the hippie movement in San Francisco.

By mid-1968, it was widely noted that most of the original "Flower Children" had long since departed the Haight Ashbury district, having been replaced by a more cynical and exploitative crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902179,00.html|title=San Francisco: Wilting Flowers|date=May 10, 1968|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Angeles===
Los Angeles also had a vibrant hippie scene during the mid-1960s. The  [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice]] coffeehouses and beat culture sustained the hippies, giving birth to bands like [[The Doors]]. [[West Hollywood]] became the quintessential L.A. hippie gathering area, particularly on the [[Sunset Strip]] where the [[Whiskey A Go Go]] was located, and [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] on Santa Monica Boulevard. The Strip was the location of the protest described in [[Buffalo Springfield]]'s early 1967 hippie anthem, "[[For What It's Worth (Stephen Stills song)|For What It's Worth]]" by [[Stephen Stills]].  One of the first "Love Ins" took place in Elysian Park and spread from there.  Many hippies lived in that portion of Los Angeles known as East Hollywood.

===Millbrook===
Before the Summer of Love, [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Richard Alpert]] formed the  International Foundation for Internal Freedom in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], inhabiting two houses but later moving to a 64-room mansion at [[Millbrook, New York]], with a communal group of about 25–30 people in residence until they were shut down in 1967.&lt;ref name="CaliCommunes"&gt;[[Timothy Miller|Miller, Timothy]].

===Drop City===
{{Main|Drop City}}
In 1965, four art students and filmmakers, Gene Bernofsky, JoAnn Bernofsky, Richard Kallweit and Clark Richert, moved to a {{convert|7|acre|m2|adj=on}} tract of land near Trinidad, Colorado. Their intention was to create a live-in work of Drop Art, continuing an art concept they had developed earlier, and informed by "[[happenings]]".  As Drop City gained notoriety in the 1960s underground, people from around the world came to stay and work on the construction projects. Inspired by the architectural ideas of [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[Steve Baer]], residents constructed [[geodesic domes]] and zonahedra to house themselves, using geometric panels made from the metal of automobile roofs and other inexpensive materials. In 1967 the group, consisting of 10 core people and many contributors, won Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion award for their constructions.

==1967==

===Summer of Love===
{{Main|Summer of Love}}

On January 14, 1967, the outdoor [[Human Be-In]] in San Francisco popularized hippie culture across the United States, with 30,000 hippies gathering in [[Golden Gate Park]].  The [[Monterey Pop Festival]] from June 16 to June 18 introduced the rock music of the counterculture to a wide audience and marked the start of the "Summer of Love".&lt;ref name="Dudley_2000_254"&gt;{{harvnb|Dudley|2000|p=254}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scott McKenzie]]'s rendition of [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]]' song, "[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)|San Francisco]]", became a hit in the United States and  Europe.  The lyrics, "If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair", inspired thousands of young people from all over the world to  travel to San Francisco, sometimes wearing flowers in their hair and distributing flowers to passersby, earning them the name, "[[flower child|Flower Children]]".

Bands like the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] (with [[Janis Joplin]]), and [[Jefferson Airplane]] continued to live in the Haight, but by the end of the summer, the incessant media coverage led the Diggers to declare the "death" of the hippie with a parade.  According to the late poet Stormi Chambless, the hippies buried an effigy of a hippie in the [[Panhandle (San Francisco)|Panhandle]] to demonstrate the end of his/her reign.  Regarding this period of history, the July 7, 1967, ''[[TIME]]'' magazine featured a cover story entitled, "The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture". The article described the guidelines of the hippie code: "Do your own thing, wherever you have to do it and whenever you want.  Drop out.  Leave society as you have known it.  Leave it utterly.  Blow the mind of every straight person you can reach.  Turn them on, if not to drugs, then to beauty, love, honesty, fun."&lt;ref name="Marty_1997_125"&gt;{{harvnb|Marty|1997|p=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that around 100,000 people traveled to San Francisco in the summer of 1967. The media was right behind them, casting a spotlight on the Haight-Ashbury district and popularizing the "hippie" label.  With this increased attention, hippies found support for their ideals of love and peace but were also criticized for their anti-work, pro-drug, and permissive ethos.  Misgivings about the hippie culture, particularly with regard to [[drug abuse]] and lenient morality, fueled the [[moral panic]]s of the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===New Communalism===
{{See also|Back-to-the-land movement}}
When the  Summer of Love finally ended, thousands of hippies left San Francisco, a large minority of them heading "back to the land".  These hippies created the largest number of [[intentional communities]] or communes in the history of the United States, forming alternative, egalitarian farms and homesteads in Northern California, Colorado, New Mexico, New York, Tennessee and other states.  According to Timothy Miller, communes were organized in many different ways, some along religious, political, and even sexual orientation.  Poet and writer [[Judson Jerome]], who studied the American commune movement, estimates that by the early 1970s, about 750,000 people lived in more than ten thousand communes across the United States.&lt;ref name="Turner_2006_3239"&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2006|pp=32–39}}.  Turner (2006) cites Timothy Miller's 1999 book, ''The 60s Communes: Hippies and Beyond''.  See also Kruger, Mark. (2006). "The Concept of Individualism at East Wind Community". Vol 17:'''2'''. pp. 371–376.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Farm
{{Main|The Farm (Tennessee)}}
In 1967, [[Stephen Gaskin]] began to develop a philosophy of hippie  perspectives at San Francisco State College, where he taught English, creative writing, and [[General Semantics]]. Gaskin's "Monday Night Class" became a broad, open discussion group involving up to 1,500 students and other participants from the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1970, Gaskin and his wife, [[Ina May Gaskin]], led a caravan of 60 buses, vans and trucks on a cross country speaking tour.  Along the way, they checked out various places that might be suitable for settlement.  When they got back to San Francisco, they decided to return to [[Summertown, Tennessee]], where they bought 1,700 acres (688 hectares) and created an intentional community called "[[The Farm (Tennessee)|The Farm]]". The Farm became a widely respected, [[spirituality|spiritually based]] hippie community that still thrives, although it is now more a hip village of 300 than a commune of 1,200. The Farm continues in many public-service and philanthropic enterprises through the Farm Midwifery Center, [[Plenty International]], and other sub-organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Bates|Bates, Albert]].

;Strawberry Fields
''The second commune on the west coast''

Started by former Boston stockbroker and later probation officer [[Gridley Wright]], Strawberry Fields, named after the song by the Beatles, occupied forty four acres of land in Decker Canyon, in the arid hills above [[Malibu, California]].  Nine adults and six children made up the original community, housed in two old houses and a barn.  Over fifty people ended up there during its five months of existence.  It was a stopping off place for [[Timothy Leary]] as well as other well known figures in the psychedelic movement. Annie and the Family were one of the original families to take up residence there; they later went on to take part in the magical mystery tour and to live in a number of other communes in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Lorenz|Lorenz, Chris]].

==1968==
By 1968,  hippie-influenced fashions were beginning to take off in the mainstream, especially for youths and younger adults of the populous "[[Baby Boomer]]" generation, many of whom may have aspired to emulate the hardcore movements now living in tribalistic communes, but had no overt connections to them. This was noticed not only in terms of clothes and also longer hair for men, but also in music, film, art, and literature, and not just in the US, but around the world. [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s brief presidential campaign successfully persuaded a significant minority of young adults to "get clean for Gene" by shaving their beards or wearing lower miniskirts; however the "Clean Genes" had little impact on the popular image in the media spotlight, of the hirsute hippie adorned in beads, feathers, flowers and bells.

The year 1968 also saw the development of two new, but dissimilar, ''genres'' of music that each exerted some influence on, and were influenced by, the hippie movements: [[heavy metal music|Heavy metal]],&lt;ref&gt;David Muggleton, ''The post subcultures reader'', pp. 218–219.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[reggae]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy White, ''Catch a Fire'', pp. 259–260.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yippies===
{{Main|Youth International Party}}
The Yippies, who were seen as an offshoot of the hippie movements parodying as a political party, came to national attention during their celebration of the 1968 spring equinox, when some 3,000 of them took over [[Grand Central Station]] in New York — eventually resulting in 61 arrests. The Yippies, especially their leaders [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Rubin]], became notorious for their theatrics, such as trying to levitate the Pentagon at the October 1967 war protest, and such slogans as "Rise up and abandon the creeping meatball!" Their stated intention to protest the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago in August, including nominating their own candidate, "[[Pigasus (politics)|Lyndon Pigasus Pig]]" (an actual pig), was also widely publicized in the media at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900067,00.html|title=Youth: The Politics of YIP|date=April 5, 1968|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the convention, city officials were prepared for the worst, with 23,000 police, National Guard, and Federal troops. Following the pig's nomination on the first day, Rubin and 6 others were arrested, but protests and music concerts were allowed to continue in Lincoln Park for two days, albeit an 11:00 PM curfew was enforced. On the Convention's second night, poet Allan Ginsberg led protesters out of the park, thus avoiding confrontation, by chanting "''[[Om]]''". On the third night, riots erupted in response to the curfew, causing police to indiscriminately attack protesters and innocent bystanders alike, including journalists from around the world and even visiting dignitaries, throughout the streets of Chicago.  The violence suffered by the journalists present, even including [[Mike Wallace]], [[Dan Rather]] and [[Hugh Hefner]], resulted in a mainstream media that was more sympathetic to certain hippie ideals, and less so to politicians, for several years. However, this galvanized the protest movement, and the following year, the trial of Hoffman, Rubin, and others as the "[[Chicago Seven]]" (originally Eight) generated significant interest.

===Resurrection City===
Beginning May 12, 1968, the newly formed [[Poor People's Campaign]], started by the recently assassinated [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], organized a [[shantytown]] known as ''Resurrection City'', composed of around 3,000 black, native, and Latino militants, along with a significant contingent of hippies and diggers, encamped on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, DC. This culminated in the June 19 "Solidarity Day" protest which drew 55,000 protesters, after which the tent settlements' population dwindled to around 300. It was finally razed, after almost 6 weeks, on June 24, 1968, by 1,000 riot police using tear gas.

==1969==

===People's Park===
{{Main|People's Park (Berkeley)}}

In April 1969, the building of People's Park in Berkeley, California received international attention.  The [[University of California, Berkeley]] had demolished all the buildings on a {{convert|2.8|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel near campus, intending to use the land to build playing fields and a parking lot. After a long delay, during which the site became a dangerous eyesore, thousands of ordinary Berkeley citizens, merchants, students, and hippies took matters into their own hands, planting trees, shrubs, flowers and grass to convert the land into a park.  A major confrontation ensued on May 15, 1969, and Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] ordered a two-week occupation of the city of Berkeley by the [[United States National Guard]]. [[Flower power]] came into its own during this occupation as hippies engaged in acts of [[civil disobedience]] to plant flowers in empty lots all over Berkeley under the slogan "Let A Thousand Parks Bloom."

===Woodstock===
[[File:Woodstock redmond cocker.JPG|thumb|Joe Cocker at Woodstock 1969]]
{{Main|Woodstock Festival}}
In August 1969, the Woodstock Music and Art Festival took place in [[Bethel, New York]], which for many, exemplified the best of hippie counterculture. Over 500,000 people arrived to hear the most notable  musicians and bands of the era, among them [[Richie Havens]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[The Who]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], and [[Jimi Hendrix]].  [[Wavy Gravy|Wavy Gravy's]] [[Hog Farm]] provided security and attended to practical needs, and the hippie ideals of love and human fellowship seemed to have gained real-world expression.

===Altamont===
{{Main|Altamont Music Festival}}
In December 1969, a similar event took place in [[Altamont, California]], about 30 miles (45&amp;nbsp;km) east of San Francisco.  Initially billed as "Woodstock West", its official name was The Altamont Free Concert.  About 300,000 people gathered to hear [[The Rolling Stones]]; [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young|Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]]; [[Jefferson Airplane]] and other bands.  The [[Hells Angels]] provided security that proved far less beneficent than the security provided at the Woodstock event:  18-year-old [[Meredith Curly Hunter, Jr.|Meredith Hunter]] was stabbed and killed while drawing a gun in front of the stage during The Rolling Stones performance, and four accidental deaths occurred.  There were also four births at the concert.

==1970 to present==
By 1970, the 1960s [[zeitgeist]] that had spawned hippie culture seemed to be on the wane,&lt;ref name="Bugliosi_1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Bugliosi|Gentry|1994|pp=638–640}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi (1994) describes the popular view that the Manson case "sounded the death knell for hippies and all they symbolically represented", citing [[Joan Didion]], [[Diane Sawyer]], and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.  Bugliosi admits that although the Manson murders "may have hastened" the end of the hippie era, the era was already in decline.&lt;/ref&gt; at least in the US. The events at Altamont shocked many Americans, including those who had strongly identified with hippie culture. Another shock came in the form of the [[Sharon Tate]] and [[Leno and Rosemary LaBianca]] murders committed in August 1969 by [[Charles Manson]] and his "family" of followers.

Nevertheless, the oppressive political atmosphere that featured the bombing of [[Cambodia]] and shootings by [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] at [[Jackson State University]] and [[Kent State University]] still brought people together. These shootings inspired the May 1970 songs by [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]] "What About Me?", where they sang "You keep adding to my numbers as you shoot my people down" and [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]]'s protest song "Ohio".

Meanwhile, in England, the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970]] (August) drew an even bigger attendance than Woodstock, and was a major gathering of the hippie movement (as well as one of the last major concert appearances for a few prominent musicians of the time, such as [[Jimi Hendrix]]).

Also in 1970, coverage of the [[Chicago Seven]] trials provided the mainstream media an opportunity to highlight the most radical aspects of the movement.  Yippie leader [[Jerry Rubin]]'s guest appearance on the ''[[Phil Donahue Show]]'' in that year (April 1) represents the virtual apex of such publicity — surpassed only by his appearance November 7 that same year on ''The [[David Frost]] Show'', where he lit a joint and tried to pass it to Frost, then summoned an army of expletive-using hippies planted in the audience to swarm the stage, all on live television.

===Charles Manson===
{{Main|Charles Manson}}
Charles Manson was a lifelong criminal who had been released from prison just in time for San Francisco's Summer of Love.  With his long hair, [[charisma]] and the ability to charm a crowd with his [[guitar]] playing, his singing and rhetoric, Manson exhibited many of the outward manifestations of hippie identity.  Yet he hardly exemplified the hippie ideals of peace, love, compassion and human fellowship; through twisted logic, [[hallucinogenic drugs]], and [[psychological manipulation]], he inspired his followers to commit murder. Manson's highly publicized 1970 trial and subsequent conviction in January 1971 irrevocably tarnished the hippie image in the eyes of many Americans.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi_1994" /&gt;

===John Lennon===
{{Main|John Lennon#Political activism}}
Also around this time, John Lennon of the Beatles and his wife [[Yoko Ono]] took up the mantle of a more prominent media role, as a force for continuing the 'humane revolution' that was politically opposed to the 'establishment'. As early as March 1969 the couple had conducted their first "Bed-In for Peace"; in August 1971 they moved to New York City and joined up with the Chicago Trial "Yippie" defendants and other notable activists.  In December 1971, Lennon sang at the [[John Sinclair Freedom Rally]] in [[Michigan]], calling attention to [[John Sinclair (poet)|Sinclair]]'s ten-year prison sentence for giving two [[joints]] to an undercover policewoman. Sinclair's release was suddenly approved by the state's authorities three days later, a testimony to the potential force of popular pressure; however, soon thereafter, the Nixon administration responded by seeking to have Lennon deported, on the pretext of a 1968 marijuana conviction in London. This dragged on through half of 1973, only increasing their status as anti-war and counterculture celebrities; by June 1973, the Watergate hearings had begun in earnest, and the famous pair made their final political statement by attending one of them.  In 1975, the deportation case was dropped, and Lennon and Yoko attended the Inaugural Ball of president [[Jimmy Carter]] in January 1977.

Although many of the original hippies and those who were core to the movement remained (or remain) dedicated to the values they originally espoused, many of those who played more peripheral roles are often seen as having "sold out" during the 1980s by becoming a part of the corporate, materialist culture they initially rejected.&lt;ref name="Lattin_2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Lattin|2004|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heath_Potter_2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Heath|Potter|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mainstream popularity of psychedelic music====
Psychedelic hard rock was the first of the psychedelic subgenres to reach the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 songs in June 1966 with "[[Paint It Black]]" by [[the Rolling Stones]]. The Stones had previously had [[hard rock]] hits such as "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]" (1965), and with "Paint It Black", they now combined hard rock with psychedelia. Other psychedelic rock #1 hits over the years were: 1967 - "[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]" (The Rolling Stones), "[[Light My Fire]]" ([[The Doors]]), "[[The Letter (The Box Tops song)|The Letter]]" ([[The Box Tops]]); 1968 - "[[Hello, I Love You]]" (The Doors), "[[People Got to Be Free]]" ([[The Rascals]]); 1969 - "[[Crimson and Clover]]" ([[Tommy James and the Shondells]], psychedelic [[garage rock]]); 1970 - "[[Venus (Shocking Blue song)|Venus]]" ([[Shocking Blue]]).

For the next several years, as new psychedelic subgenres began to mushroom, combining with other styles, the charts saw numerous #1 hits reflecting their level of popularity with young music listeners. These subgenres included:

*''[[Psychedelic folk]]'' - hit #1 in September 1966 with "[[Sunshine Superman]]" ([[Donovan]]). Other psychedelic folk #1 hits include: 1967 - "[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]" ([[The Turtles]]); 1968 - "[[Mrs. Robinson]]" ([[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]]); 1969 - "[[In the Year 2525]]" ([[Zager and Evans]]); 1971 - "[[Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves]]" ([[Cher]]); 1972 - "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]" ([[Don McLean]]), "[[A Horse with No Name]]" ([[America (band)|America]]).
*''[[Psychedelic pop]]'' - hit #1 in September 1966 with "[[Cherish (The Association song)|Cherish]]" ([[The Association]]). Other psychedelic pop #1 hits include: 1966 - "[[Good Vibrations]]" ([[The Beach Boys]]); 1967 - "[[Penny Lane]]" ([[The Beatles]]), "[[Windy]]" (The Association), "[[All You Need Is Love]]" (The Beatles), "[[To Sir With Love (song)|To Sir With Love]]" ([[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]]), "[[Incense and Peppermints]]" ([[Strawberry Alarm Clock]]), "[[Hello, Goodbye]]" (The Beatles); 1968 - "[[Hey, Jude]]" (The Beatles); 1969 - "[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In]]" ([[The 5th Dimension]], psychedelic [[sunshine pop]]) 1971 - "[[Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey]]" ([[Paul McCartney]]).
*''[[Psychedelic soul]]'' - hit #1 in October 1966 with "[[Reach Out I'll Be There]]" ([[Four Tops]]). Other psychedelic soul #1 hits include: 1967 - "[[The Happening (song)|The Happening]]" ([[The Supremes]]); 1968 - "[[Love Child (song)|Love Child]]" (The Supremes); 1969 - "[[Everyday People]]" ([[Sly and the Family Stone]]), "[[I Can't Get Next to You]]" ([[The Temptations]]), "[[Wedding Bell Blues]]" (The 5th Dimension); 1970 - "[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]" ([[Edwin Starr]]); 1971 - "[[Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)|Just My Imagination]]" (The Temptations), "[[Family Affair (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]" (Sly and the Family Stone); 1972 - "[[Lean on Me (song)|Lean on Me]]" ([[Bill Withers]]), "[[Papa Was a Rollin' Stone]]" (The Temptations); 1973 - "[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]" ([[Roberta Flack]]).
*''Psychedelic [[bubblegum pop]]'' - hit #1 in February 1968 with "[[Green Tambourine]]" ([[Lemon Pipers]]). Psychedelic bubblegum pop included #1 hits such as: 1969 - "[[Dizzy (Tommy Roe song)|Dizzy]]" ([[Tommy Roe]]). Bubblegum pop then became a genre in its own right, and drifted away from psychedelia with #1 hits by artists including [[The Archies]], [[The Jackson 5]], [[The Partridge Family]], [[The Osmonds]], and the [[Honey Cone]].
*''[[Psychedelic rock|Psychedelic blues rock]]'' - hit #1 in November 1969 with "[[Come Together]]" (The Beatles). Other psychedelic blues #1 hits include: 1970 - "[[American Woman]]" ([[The Guess Who]]); 1971 - "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]" ([[Janis Joplin]]).
*''[[Hard rock|Heavy]] [[Psychedelic rock|psych]]'' - Bands like [[Iron Butterfly]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Blue Cheer]], [[Sir Lord Baltimore]], [[Mount Rushmore (band)|Mount Rushmore]], [[Morgen (band)|Morgen]], [[Blue Öyster Cult]], [[Yesterday's Children]], [[Andromeda (English Band)|Andromeda]], [[Edgar Broughton Band]], [[High Tide (band)|High Tide]], [[Josefus]], [[Captain Beyond]], [[Frijid Pink]], [[Third Power]], [[Morly Grey]], [[The Illusion (band)|The Illusion]], [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], [[May Blitz]], [[Pink Fairies]], [[The Open Mind (band)|The Open Mind]], [[Crow (band)|Crow]], [[The Litter]], [[Mason (American Band)|Mason]], [[Toe Fat]], [[Stack Waddy]], [[Leaf Hound]], [[Buffalo (band)|Buffalo]], [[Kahvas Jute]], [[Baumstam]], [[Flower Travellin' Band]], [[Creation (Japanese Band)|Blues Creation]], [[Speed, Glue &amp; Shinki]], [[JPT Scare Band]], [[Truth and Janey]] and also some early material by [[Grand Funk Railroad]], [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]], [[MC5]] and [[The Stooges]] mixed psychedelic/acid blues rock with some heavier sounds between the late 60s and early 70s. Even if some of them have gained some mainstream attention, most of them were underground bands and they were re-discovered by collectionists and stoner rock fans.

Many genres that first appeared in the 1970s also incorporated psychedelic influences in the beginning, such as [[soft rock]] and [[disco]], though they soon developed their own sounds that were distinct from psychedelic music.

"Heath_Potter_2004"/&gt;

Hippies who did not "sell out" have been featured in the press as recently as April 2014. Forty years after founding the "Hippie Kitchen" in [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Los Angeles' Skid Row]] in the back of a van, [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Workers]] Jeff Dietrich, a [[Draft evasion|draft resister]], and Catherine Morris, a [[List of former Roman Catholic nuns|former nun]], remained active in their work feeding Skid Row residents and [[Peace movement|protesting wars]], especially in front of the local [[Wilshire Federal Building|Federal Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Hippies may still be found in [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] enclaves around the world.&lt;ref name="Stone_1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/havens.htm Hippy Havens]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary hippies have made use of the [[World Wide Web]] and can be found on virtual communities. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[New age travellers]] movement, while eschewing the label 'hippie', nevertheless revived many hippie traditions into the 1980s and 1990s.  Current events, [[festivals]] and [[parties]] continue to promote the hippie lifestyle and values. The "[[boho-chic]]" fashion style of 2003-2007 had a number of hippie features and the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' even used the term "hippie chic" (March 11, 2005).

===Neo-hippies===
[[File:Freespiritartcar.jpg|thumb|[[Art car]] seen in Northern California]]
Neo-hippies, some of whom are children and grandchildren of the original hippies, advocate many of the same beliefs of their 1960s counterparts.
Drug use is just as accepted as in the "original" hippie days, although some neo-hippies do not consider it necessary to take drugs in order to be part of the lifestyle, and others reject drug use in favor of alternative methods of reaching higher or altered consciousness such as drumming circles, community singing, meditation, yoga and dance. On April 20 (4/20) many neo-hippies gather at "Hippie Hill" in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco.

In the United States, some hippies refer to themselves as "Rainbows", a name derived from their tie-dyed T-shirts, and for some, from their participation in the hippie group, "[[Rainbow Family]] of Living Light".  Since the early 1970s, the Rainbows meet informally  at [[Rainbow Gathering]]s on U.S. National Forest Land  as well as internationally.  "Peace, love, harmony, freedom, and community" is their motto.

===Activism===
{{Main|Occupy movement}}
Hippies have maintained activist activities after the 1960s. Heavy hippie presence has been noted at the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests, and was at times ridiculed.&lt;ref name="occupy hippies"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/occupy-wall-street-yes-i-hate-hippies-2011-10 |title=I Hate Useless, Loitering Hippies, But I Despise Wall Street Even More |accessdate=2011-10-11 |date=October 11, 2011 |work=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Business Insider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
{{Original research|date=October 2007}}

[[File:Glastonmud 85.jpg|thumb|right|Glastonbury Festival in 1985]]

The tradition of hippie festivals began in the United States in 1965 with Ken Kesey's [[Acid Tests]], where the [[Grateful Dead]] played under the influence of [[LSD]] and initiated psychedelic jamming.  For the next several decades, many hippies and neo-hippies became part of the [[Deadhead]] and [[Phish Head]] communities, attending  music and art festivals held around the country.  The [[Grateful Dead]] toured continuously, with few interruptions between 1965 and 1995. [[Phish]] toured sporadically between 1983 and 2004.  With the demise of the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Phish]], the nomadic touring hippies have been left without a main jam band to follow.  Instead, they attend a growing series of summer festivals, the largest of which is called the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival]], which premiered in 2002.

The [[Oregon Country Fair]] began in 1969 as a benefit for an alternative school.  Currently, the three-day festival features handmade crafts, educational displays and costumed entertainment in a wooded setting near [[Veneta, Oregon]], just west of [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. Each year the festival becomes the third largest city in Lane County.

The annual [[Starwood Festival]], founded in 1981, is a six-day event held in [[Pomeroy, Ohio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starwoodfestival.com/|title=The Starwood Festival|website=The Starwood Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicative of the spiritual quest of hippies through an exploration of non-mainstream religions and world-views. It has offered performances and classes by a variety of hippie and counter-culture icons, from musical guests like [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], [[Merl Saunders]] and [[Babatunde Olatunji]] to speakers such as [[Timothy Leary]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[Paul Krassner]], [[Stephen Gaskin]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]], [[Harvey Wasserman]] and [[Ralph Metzner]].

The [[Burning Man]] festival began in 1986 at a San Francisco beach party.  Now an annual gathering, the event is held in the [[Black Rock Desert]] northeast of [[Reno, Nevada]].  Though few participants would accept the "hippie" label, Burning Man is a contemporary expression of alternative community in the same spirit as early hippie events.  The gathering becomes a temporary city (36,500 occupants in 2005), with  elaborate encampments, displays and many [[art cars]].

Held annually in Manchester, Tennessee, the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]] has become a tradition for many music fans, since its sold-out premiere in 2002.  Approximately 70-80,000 attend Bonnaroo yearly.  The festival producers have made investments in their property, constructing vast telecommunications networks, potable water supplies, sanitation facilities, and safety features such as first aid shelters for every 200-300 fans.

The [[10,000 Lakes Festival]] is an annual three-day music festival in [[Detroit Lakes, Minnesota]]. Also referred to as '10KLF' (K for thousand, LF for Lakes Festival), the festival began in 2003. Attendance in 2006 was around 18,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10klf.com 10KLF :: music | nature | euphoria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030162954/http://www.10klf.com/ |date=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1981 People Pix.jpg|thumb|right|Hippies at the [[Nambassa]] 1981 Festival [[New Zealand]] ]]

In the UK, there are many [[new age travellers]] who are known as hippies to outsiders, but prefer to call themselves the [[Peace Convoy]]. They started the [[Stonehenge Free Festival]] in 1974, especially [[Wally Hope]], until the [[English Heritage]] legally banned the festival, resulting in the [[Battle of the Beanfield]] in 1985. With Stonehenge banned as a festival site new age travellers gather at the annual [[Glastonbury Festival]] to see hundreds of live dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret and other performances. Others  argue that it has now become too much of a commercial event, and instead opt for smaller festivals such as [[Beautiful Days (festival)|Beautiful Days]], [[Sunrise Celebration]], or the [[Big Green Gathering]]. In 2005, Glastonbury festival covered 900 acres (3.6&amp;nbsp;km²) and attracted 150,000 people.

In Australia the hippie movement originated at the [[Aquarius Festival]] held in 1971 in [[Canberra]] and again in [[Nimbin, New South Wales|Nimbin]] two years later.&lt;ref name="bt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/relationships/peace-love-and-real-life/2008/03/14/1205472071315.html?page=2 |title=Peace, love and real life |accessdate=2009-11-03 |date=March 14, 2008 |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Digital]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many festival goers stayed in Nimbin, transforming the town and local area. It also resulted in the formation of one of Australia's largest and most successful [[commune (intentional community)|commune]]s.

Between 1976 and 1981, hippie music festivals were held on large farms around [[Waihi]] and [[Waikino]] in [[New Zealand]]- [[Aotearoa]].  Named ''[[Nambassa]]'', the festivals focused on [[peace]], [[love]], and a balanced lifestyle, featuring [[workshops]] and displays advocating [[alternative lifestyles]], clean and [[sustainable energy]], and unadulterated foods.  Nambassa is also the tribal name of a trust that has championed sustainable ideas and demonstrated practical [[counterculture]] and [[alternative lifestyle]] methods since the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Nambassa: A New Direction, edited by Colin Broadley and Judith Jones, A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed, 1979. {{ISBN|0589012169}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the bands performing at hippie festivals, and their derivatives, are called [[jam band]]s, since they play songs that contain long instrumentals similar to the original hippie bands of the 1960s. [[Psychedelic trance]] or "[[psytrance]]", a type of [[techno]] music influenced by 1960s [[psychedelic rock]] and hippie culture is also popular among neo-hippies worldwide.  Psytrance hippies usually attend separate festivals where only electronic music is played.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4007">'''Itching powder''' refers to a group of [[Powder (substance)|powders]] or powder-like substances that induce [[itching]] when applied onto human [[skin]]. This is usually done as a [[Practical joke device|practical joke]] or [[prank]] to an unsuspecting victim.

The cause of the irritation can be mechanical, such as products containing ground [[rose hips]].&lt;ref name="albert"&gt;Albert MR. Novelty shop "itching powder."

March 1963&lt;/ref&gt; a type of [[legume]] that produces seedpods coated with thousands of detachable spicules (needle-like hairs), the spicules contain an enzyme ([[mucunain]]) that causes severe itching, and they have been sold commercially as itching powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Epidemiologic Notes and Reports Mucuna pruriens- Associated Pruritus – New Jersey |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000646.htm |website=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=15 July 2018 |date=6 December 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mucuna pruriens'' has been used to test the efficacy of [[antipruritic|anti-itch drugs]].&lt;ref name="joglekar"/&gt;

The term "itching powder" is colloquial; there is no one specific source of the powder, though some gag companies do tend to have favourites. Two very common, accessible, and fairly harmless (though not entirely – itching powder can be very dangerous when abused) sources are maple [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] and rosehips.

'''''Karcher v. May''''', 484 U.S. 72 (1987),&lt;ref name=decision&gt;{{ussc|name=Karcher v. May|volume=484|page=72|pin=|year=1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[school prayer]] case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the former presiding officers of the New Jersey legislature did not have Article III [[standing (law)|standing]] to appeal a case, that standing had passed on to their legislative successors.

==Background==
In 1982, the [[New Jersey]] [[New Jersey Legislature|Legislature]] passed a statute over the governor's veto providing for a [[moment of silence]] in public schools, which failed to specifically mention [[prayer]]. May filed a lawsuit in the federal [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] challenging the constitutionality of the statute; the executive-branch officials normally tasked with defending such suits (the Governor and the Attorney General) admitted the unconstitutionality of the statute and refused to defend it in court. Consequently, [[Alan Karcher]], Speaker of the [[New Jersey General Assembly]], and [[Carmen Orechio]], President of the [[New Jersey Senate]], moved to [[intervention (law)|intervene]] (under Rule 24 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]) as defendants on behalf of the Legislature; the court granted the motion. In 1983, the District Court found that the purpose of the statute was religious, and deemed the law unconstitutional on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref name=kamen&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1357500.html|title=Ruling on `Moment of Silence' Avoided; Court Also Curtails Environmental Suits Under Clean Water Act|last=Kamen|first=Al|date=December 2, 1987|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1347183.html|title=Court Hears Suit Over Schools' Moment of Silence; Questions Suggest a Definitive Ruling Is Unlikely on New Jersey Law's Constitutionality|last=Kamen|first=Al|date=October 7, 1987|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karcher and Orechio appealed, although by the time of filing their terms as Speaker and President had expired; their successors, [[Chuck Hardwick]] and [[John F. Russo]], joined the executive officers in refusing to defend the constitutionality of the statute. Karcher and Orechio's lawyer, [[Rex E. Lee]], nevertheless contended that their standing to continue to defend suit on the state's behalf remained, and also argued the purpose of the law was secular.&lt;ref name="Association1987"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3Kqlldz7GAC&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=1987-10-01|publisher=American Bar Association Journal|pages=50–|title=School Prayer|author=Andrea Neal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vile2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vile|first=John R.|title=Great American Lawyers: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XR1NPiqp5aQC&amp;pg=PA457|accessdate=20 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576072028|pages=457–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
The court found that the former legislative leaders lacked standing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1987/12/09/07390036.h07.html|title=Technicality Bars Ruling On Moments of Silence|last=Mirga|first=Tom|date=December 9, 1987|work=Education Week|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that that authority had passed by design to the current leaders of the New Jersey legislature.&lt;ref name="Schwartz1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=|title=Section 1983 Lit: Clms V1b 3e|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5tmAUU_QtqQC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=1995-12-31|publisher=Aspen Publishers Online|isbn=9780735549357|pages=178–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s majority decision was joined by six other justices, with Justice [[Byron White]] writing a concurring opinion. There was no ninth vote, as Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] had resigned earlier in the year, and no replacement had yet been confirmed.

As a result of this opinion, the district court ruling that the law was unconstitutional was left intact.&lt;ref name=kamen/&gt;

Once possessed by the spirit, the body in which the Kokou inhabits may remain in a trance all day and in due course demonstrate a thirst for blood with glass bottles and knives, swallow sharp objects or repeatedly beat its head against the wall until it bleeds profusively, revealing a high tolerance to pain.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;

[[ISO 639]] is a standardized nomenclature used to classify [[language]]s. Each language is assigned a two-letter (639-1) and three-letter (639-2 and 639-3), lowercase abbreviation, amended in later versions of the nomenclature.

This table lists all of:
* [[ISO 639-1]]: two-letter codes, one per language for [[ISO 639 macrolanguage]]
And some of:
* [[ISO 639-2|ISO 639-2/T]]: three-letter codes, for the same languages as 639-1
* [[ISO 639-2|ISO 639-2/B]]: three-letter codes, mostly the same as 639-2/T, but with some codes derived from English names rather than native names of languages (in the following table, these differing codes are highlighted in '''[[boldface]]''')
* [[ISO 639-3]]: three-letter codes, the same as 639-2/T for languages, but with distinct codes for each variety of an ISO 639 macrolanguage

Note: Colors on the leftmost column represent the language family mentioned in second column.

A '''machine shop''' is a room, building, or company where [[machining]] is done. In a machine shop, [[machinist]]s use [[machine tool]]s and [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tools]] to make parts, usually of [[metal]] or [[plastic]] (but sometimes of other materials such as [[glass]] or [[wood]]). A machine shop can be a [[small business]] (such as a [[job shop]]) or a portion of a [[factory]], whether a [[toolroom]] or a production area for [[manufacturing]]. The parts produced can be the [[Product (business)|end product]] of the factory, to be sold to customers in the [[machine industry]], the [[car industry]], the [[aircraft industry]], or others. In other cases, companies in those fields have their own machine shops.

The production can consist of [[cutting]], shaping, [[drilling]], finishing, and other processes. The machine tools typically include [[metal lathe]]s, [[milling (machining)|milling machines]], machining centers, multitasking machines, [[drill press]]es, or [[grinding machine]]s, many controlled with [[numerical control|computer numerical control]] (CNC). Other processes, such as [[heat treating]], [[electroplating]], or [[painting]] of the parts before or after machining, are often done in a separate facility. A machine shop can contain some [[raw material]]s (such as [[bar stock]] for machining) and an [[inventory]] of finished parts. These items are often stored in a [[warehouse]].

A machine shop can be a [[capital intensity|capital intensive]] business, because the [[purchasing|purchase]] of equipment can require large [[investment]]s. A machine shop can also be [[labor intensity|labour-intensive]], especially if it is specialized in repairing machinery on a [[job production]] basis, but production machining (both [[batch production]] and [[mass production]]) is much more [[automation|automated]] than it was before the development of CNC, [[programmable logic controller|programmable logic control]] (PLC), [[microcomputer]]s, and [[robotics]]. It no longer requires masses of [[workforce|workers]], although the [[job]]s that remain tend to require high [[aptitude|talent]] and [[skill]]. [[Training]] and [[experience]] in a machine shop can both be scarce and valuable.

== History ==

=== Until the 19th century ===
The first machine shops started to appear in the 19th century when the [[Industrial Revolution]] was already long underway. Before the industrial revolution parts and tools were produced in workshops in local villages and cities on small-scale often for a local market. The first machinery that made possible the Industrial Revolution were also developed in similar [[workshop]]s.

The production machines in the first factories were built on site, where every part was still individually made to fit. After some time those factories started their own workshops, where parts of the existing machinery were repaired or modified. In those days textiles were the dominant industry, and these industries started to further develop their own machine tools.

=== 19th century ===

[[File:Machine Shop Men GPN-2000-000364.jpg|thumb|Machinists and toolmakers making experimental engine parts at the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory, 1946.]]
Further development early in the 19th century in [[England]], [[Germany]] and [[Scotland]] of [[machine tool]]s and cheaper methods for production of steel, such as the [[Bessemer steel]], triggered the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], which culminated in early factory electrification, mass production and the production line. The machine shop emerged as Burghardt called, a "place in which metal parts are cut to the size required and put together to form mechanical units or machines, the machines so made to be used directly or indirectly in the production of the necessities and luxuries of civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Henry D. Burghardt (1919). ''Machine Tool Operation.'' p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of machine shops and their specific manufacturing and organizational problems triggered the early [[job shop]] management pioneers, whose theories became known with as [[scientific management]]. One of the earliest publications in this field was [[Horace Lucian Arnold]], who in 1896 wrote a first series of articles about "Modern Machine-Shop Economics."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold, Horace L.]] "Modern Machine-Shop Economics." in ''Engineering Magazine'' 11. 1896: [https://archive.org/stream/factoryindustria11newy#page/58/mode/2up Part I], [https://archive.org/stream/factoryindustria11newy#page/262/mode/2up Part II], [https://archive.org/stream/factoryindustria11newy#page/468/mode/2up Part III], [https://archive.org/stream/factoryindustria11newy#page/468/mode/2up Part IV], [https://archive.org/stream/factoryindustria11newy#page/882/mode/2up Part V], and [https://archive.org/stream/factoryindustria11newy#page/1088/mode/2up Part VI]&lt;/ref&gt; This work stretched out from production technology, production methods and factory lay out to time studies, [[production planning]], and machine shop management. A series of publications on these topic would follow. In 1899 [[Joshua Rose (engineer)|Joshua Rose]] published the book ''Modern machine-shop practice,'' about the operation, construction, and principles of shop machinery, steam engines, and electrical machinery.

=== 20th century ===
In 1903 the ''Cyclopedia of Modern Shop Practice'' was published with [[Howard Monroe Raymond]] as Editor-in-Chief, and in the same year [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] published his ''Shop management; a paper read before the American society of mechanical engineers. New York.'' Taylor had started his workmanship as a machine-shop laborer at Midvale Steel Works in 1878, and worked his way up to machine shop foreman, research director, and finally chief engineer of the works. As independent consulting engineer one of his first major assignments was in 1898 at [[Bethlehem Steel]] was to solve an expensive machine-shop capacity problem.

In 1906 [[Oscar E. Perrigo]] published the popular book ''Modern machine shop,'' construction the equipment and management of machines shops. The first part of ''Modern machine shop,'' Perrigo (1906)  focussed on the physical construction of the building, and presented a model machine shop. With this model machine shop Perrigo explored the way the space in factories could be organized.&lt;ref name="AVA 2008"&gt;Anna Vemer Andrzejewski (2008). ''Building Power: Architecture and Surveillance in Victorian America.'' p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This was not uncommon in his days. Many [[industrial engineer]]s, like [[Alexander Hamilton Church]], [[J. Slater Lewis]], [[Hugo Diemer]] etc., published plans for some new industrial complex.

These works among others cumulated in the [[scientific management]] movement on which Taylor in 1911 wrote his famous ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management]],'' a seminal text of modern organization and [[decision theory]], with a significant part dedicated to the organization of machine shops.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Winslow Taylor. ''Scientific Management.'' Routledge, 1911/1 jun. 2004; This work the term "machine shop" is mentioned 31 times during the book.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of new cutting materials as [[high-speed steel]], and better organization of the production by implementing new [[scientific management]] methods such as planning boards (see image), significantly improved machine shop [[productivity]] and [[efficiency]] of machine shops. In the course of the 20th century these further increased with the further development of technology.

In the early 20th century, the power for the machine tools was still supplied by a [[Belt (mechanical)|mechanical belt]], which was powered by a central steam engine. In the course of the 20th century electric motors took over the power supply of the machine tools. In the second part of the 20th century, automation started with [[numerical control]] (NC) automation, and computer numerical control (CNC). Further integration of information technology into machine tools lead to beginning of [[computer-integrated manufacturing]]. Production design and production became integrated into [[CAD/CAM]], and [[production control]] became integrated in [[enterprise resource planning]].

=== 21st century ===
The introduction of [[industrial robot]]s in the second part of the 20th century further increased factory automation. Typical applications of robots include welding, painting, assembly, pick and place (such as packaging, palletizing and SMT), product inspection, and testing. As a result of this introduction the machine shop also "has been modernized to the extent that robotics and electronic controls have been introduced into the operation and control of machines.&lt;ref&gt;Rex Miller, Mark Richard Miller (2004). ''AudelMachine Shop Tools and Operations.'' p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

== Machine shop topics ==

=== Machines ===
{{Main article|machine}}
A [[machine]] is a [[tool]] containing one or more parts that uses [[energy]] to perform an intended action. Machines are usually [[Work (physics)|powered]] by mechanical, chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often [[Engine|motorized]]. Historically, a [[power tool]] also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of [[electronics]] has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary'', Second College Edition. Houghton Mifflin Co., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machining ===
[[Machining]] is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The many processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing, in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the "controlled" part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).

=== Machine tools ===
{{main article|machine tool}}
A [[machine tool]] is a [[machine]] for shaping or [[machining]] metal or other rigid materials, usually by cutting, boring, [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], shearing, or other forms of deformation.  Machine tools employ some sort of tool that does the cutting or shaping.  All machine tools have some means of constraining the workpiece and provide a guided movement of the parts of the machine. Thus the relative movement between the workpiece and the [[cutting tool]] is controlled or constrained by the machine to at least some extent, rather than being entirely "offhand" or "freehand".

{{Life in Malaysia}}
'''Malaysian literature''' is the collection of literary works produced in the [[Malay peninsula]] until 1963 and in [[Malaysia]] thereafter. Malaysian literature is typically written in any of the country's four main languages: [[Malay language|Malay]], [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. It portrays various aspects of Malaysian life and comprises an important part of the [[culture of Malaysia]].

The earliest works of Malaysian literature were transmitted orally in the absence of writing scripts. [[Oral literature]] encompasses a variety of genres of [[Malay folklore]], such as [[myth]]s, [[legend]]s, [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]], [[Epic poetry|epics]], [[poetry]], [[proverb]]s, origin stories and oral histories. Oral tradition thrived among the [[Malay people|Malays]], but continues to survive among the indigenous people of Malaysia, including the [[Orang Asli]] and numerous ethnic groups in [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]].

==Information==
[[File:Malacca Literature Museum.JPG|thumb|[[Malacca Literature Museum]]]]

Early Malays literature was mainly influenced by Indian epics, such as the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Ramayana]], which later included other traditions that now form the Malay literary heritage prose which were delivered through generations by oral, such as the Hikayat Mara Karma, [[Hikayat Panca Tanderan]] and Hikayat Gul Bakawali. Much of the stories were recompiled and republished into books, driven by Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, the national language society. Malay romantic tales were also sourced from the [[Panji cycle]] of Hindu [[Java]]. There were also several forms of Malay poetry, which are either in the form of pantun (poems that rhymed with each other and are didactic in its every sense), syair (a long narrative poem, that is made up of four stanzas and recited with a tone akin to singing), gurindam and seloka and are still remain popular until today.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume9/literaryheritage.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106024444/http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume9/literaryheritage.html |archivedate=6 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Orang Asli]], literature was and still is constituted by accounts of actual events. Different ethnic groups have different versions of the same story, although there are several recurring themes and elements in every tale.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"/&gt;

The cultural practices of the indigenous people in [[Sarawak]] are shaped in part by oral traditions. Themes like the relationship of the people to their past, particularly their ancestry, and the spirit world, including its influence on the production of food and health are the primary themes of the oral literature of various ethnic groups in Sarawak. The recitation of [[oral literature]] is often accompanied by rituals.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"/&gt;

The oral traditions of [[Sabah]] encompass folk tales and legends, such as [[creation myth]]s, that have been preserved by the ethnic groups in the state. This oral literature is recited during ceremonies conducted by priestesses, who serve as ritual specialists, faith healers and spirit mediums.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"/&gt;

By the 19th century, oral literature on the Malay peninsula was superseded by [[written literature]]. This was attributed largely in part to the introduction of [[Islam]] to the Peninsula by the 15th century and the adoption of the [[Jawi script]] as well as their surging fervor of nationalism that had seeped through the intellectuals, educated in Turkey or in Al-Azhar University, in Egypt. This tradition was influenced both by earlier oral traditions and [[Islamic literature]] from the [[Middle East]]. Works during this time ranged from theological literature that discusses religion as the crucial solution towards social problems as well as colonialism (Melati Kota Bharu by Abdul Kadir Adabi) and legal digests, to romances (Nasib Hasnah by Abdullah Sidek; discusses of the principles of romance and long-lasting relationship within the husband and the wife, moral anecdotes (commonly seen in short stories throughout 1920s and the 1930s), popular tales of Islamic prophets and even animal tales, which were written in a number of styles ranging from religious to the ''[[Hikayat]]'' form.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"/&gt;

The literary traditions of the Malay sultanates were distinct in that scribes were hired to record the significant events of the time. One important work of this period was ''[[Sejarah Melayu]]'' (The Malay Annals), which was written during the era of the [[Malacca Sultanate]], rewritten in 1536 and revised in 1612.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"/&gt;
 
A surge of new, modern writers gave the birth of what considered as a novelty then, in the form of novel and short story. The colonialism and the increasing numbers of intellectuals mainly educated in MPSI (Maktab Perguruan Sultan Idris) or MCKK (Malay College Kuala Kangsar) had such profound impact throughout the development of the two forms. First developed by Abdullah Munshi in his Hikayat Pelayaran, it is developed more by the end of the 1920s and throughout the 1930s. Much of the works were didactic in every sense, implementing elements of religion and theology, and a critique of the social problems that surfaced and deemed to halt such progresses of economic prosperity as well as independence. In every sense, their novels often melancholic and portrayed the Malay proletariat class in an idealistic manner, much driven with realism as well as romanticism. Writers during this period were Abdul Rahim Kajai, Harun Aminurrashid and to a lesser extent, Abdullah Sidek.

During the Japanese Occupation, literature were mainly driven with such fervor of the Emperor of Japan and were published in magazines (Fajar Asia as such). Most of the works centered about the strength of the Japanese Army and their successes, and Japanese-induced nationalistic fervor. Not much of the novel, short story nor poetry were written during this period, only a few remained from the 1930s such as Ishak Haji Muhammad and Abdul Rahim Kajai.

==Poetry==
Traditional Malay poetry was used for entertainment and the recording of history and laws. There are three forms of traditional Malay poetry: the ''[[mantra|mantera]]'', the ''[[pantun]]'' and the ''[[syair]]''. Modern Malay poetry consists of the ''[[Sajak (poetry)|sajak]]''.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"/&gt;

}}The '''National Dance Association''' ('''NDA'''), is a defunct association of SHAPEAmerica, formerly the [[American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance]] (AAHPERD).  It was the oldest of dance education organizations, and developed programs, published books and materials, and sponsored professional development conferences for dance educators in a broad range of disciplines.

==History==
The [http://www.aahperd.org/NDA/ National Dance Association] was originally established in 1932 as the section on Dance by the American Physical Education Association (APEA), a forerunner to the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education and Recreation (AAHPER). It was elevated to Divisional status in 1965 and nine years later became an association within the newly renamed American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (AAHPERD). In 2013 NDA was dissolved as AAHPERD became one unified organization and changed its name to SHAPE America (Society of Health and Physical Education).

===Constituencies Served===
NDA serves dance educators in the following areas:
''Early Childhood
Elementary
Secondary
College/University
Private Studios/ Schools
Dance Medicine &amp; Science
Dance Technology
Curriculum Development
Publications Development
Dance Performance
Dance for the Differently Abled
Advocacy and Public Relations
''{{clarify|date=October 2011}}

===Teacher/Dance Educator Enhancement===
NDA promoted dance professionalism through continuing education credits in workshops and conventions held at national, district and state levels. Publications included NDA's landmark document, the National Standards for Dance Education, Opportunity- to- Learn Standards for Dance and Anne Green Gilbert's Creative Dance for All Ages.

===Dance Science and Somatics===
NDA was at the forefront supporting efforts to integrate technology within the arts through such conferences as Dancing with the Mouse and Page-to-Stage. It supported healthy lifestyles through its publications Dance Movement Therapy and Preventing Dance Injuries.

==Nu Delta Alpha==
Nu Delta Alpha was an Honor Society that recognized Students and Professionals for High Achievements in Dance.
It was designed for dance education students, dance educators, and professional dancers to express their devotion to the art form by sharing, recognizing, and promoting dance education within schools and communities.  Nu Delta Alpha chapters were designated for middle through high school, college through professional levels, private studios, and preparatory and home schools.  Affiliation with Nu Delta Alpha provided students and professionals with the opportunity to advocate for dance education.

==Officers==
NDA is governed by a Board of Directors.

==History==

The name Nepal Sambat was used for the calendar for the first time in Nepal Sambat 148 (1028 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Malla | first =K. P.| url = http://www.kpmalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-relevance-of-Nepala-samvat.pdf

===Sankhadhar Sakhwa===
The Nepal Sambat epoch corresponds to 879 AD, which commemorates the payment of all the debts of the Nepalese people by a merchant named [[Sankhadhar Sakhwa]] in popular legend.&lt;ref&gt;https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/sankhadhar-sakhwa-may-never-existed-experts/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=10891 My Republica]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legend, an astrologer from [[Bhaktapur]] predicted that the sand at the confluence Bhacha Khushi and [[Bishnumati River]] in [[Kathmandu]] would transform into gold at a certain moment, so the king sent a team of workers to Kathmandu to collect sand from the spot at the special hour. A local merchant named Sankhadhar Sakhwa saw them resting with their baskets of sand at a traveler's shelter at [[Maru, Kathmandu|Maru]] near Durbar Square before returning to Bhaktapur. Believing that the sand to be unusual if the workers were gathering it, he convinced them to give it to him instead. The next day, Sakhwa discovered his sand had turned to gold, while the king of Bhaktapur was left with a pile of ordinary sand which his porters had dug up after the auspicious hour had passed. Sankhadhar used the gold to repay the debts of the people of Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pradhananga|first=Gyanendra Dhar|title=The sands of time|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2012/01/28/free-the-words/the-sands-of-time/230946.html|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = Daniel | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfNepal/HistoryOfNepaldanielWright#page/n199/mode/2up| title = History of Nepal | work = | publisher = New Delhi: Asian Educational Services | year=1990| pages=163-165|accessdate = 28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use outside Kathmandu===

Nepal Sambat has also been used outside [[Nepal Mandala]] in Nepal and in other countries including [[India]], [[China]] and [[Myanmar]]. In [[Gorkha District|Gorkha]], a stone inscription at the Bhairav Temple at Pokharithok Bazaar contains the date Nepal Sambat 704 (1584 AD). An inscription in the [[Nepali language]] at a rest house in [[Salyankot]] is dated Nepal Sambat 912 (1792 AD).&lt;ref&gt;''Itihas Prakash'' (14 April 1955). Kathmandu: Itihas Prakash Mandal. Page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In east Nepal, an inscription on the Bidyadhari Ajima Temple in [[Bhojpur, Nepal|Bhojpur]] recording the donation of a door and [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is dated Nepal Sambat 1011 (1891 AD). The Bindhyabasini Temple in [[Bandipur]] in west Nepal contains an inscription dated Nepal Sambat 950 (1830 AD) recording the donation of a tympanum.&lt;ref&gt;''Jhee'' (February–March 1975). Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Bikas Mandal. Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Palanchok Bhagawati Temple]] situated to the east of Kathmandu contains an inscription recording a land donation dated Nepal Sambat 861 (1741 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (ed.) (1971). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Jatah.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Pages 113.&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription on a [[stupa]] in [[Panauti]] is dated Nepal Sambat 866 (1746 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (ed.) (1971). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Jatah.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Pages 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Nepalese merchants based in Tibet ([[Lhasa Newar (trans-Himalayan traders)|Lhasa Newars]]) used Nepal Sambat in their official documents, correspondence and inscriptions recording votive offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (ed.) (1971). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Jatah.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Pages 255-256.&lt;/ref&gt; A copper plate recording the donation of a tympanum at the shrine of Chhwaskamini Ajima (Tibetan: [[Palden Lhamo]]) in the [[Jokhang]] Temple in [[Lhasa]] is dated Nepal Sambat 781 (1661 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (ed.) (1971). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Jatah.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression and campaign for revival===

Nepal Sambat was replaced as the national calendar in [[Rana dynasty|Rana period]] of Nepal. The victory of the Gorkha Kingdom resulted in the end of the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla dynasty]] and the advent of The Shahs used [[Saka era]]. However, Nepal Sambat remained in official use for a time even after the coming of the Shahs. For example, the treaty with [[Tibet]] signed during the reign of [[Pratap Singh Shah]] is dated Nepal Sambat 895 (1775 AD). In 1903, Saka Sambat, in turn, was superseded by [[Bikram Sambat]] as the official calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=10891 My Republica]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government continued to use Saka Sambat on gold and silver coins till 1912 when it was fully replaced by Bikram Sambat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Pradhan |first= Bhuvan Lal |title= Maniharsha Jyoti in the Fields of Religion, Language and Era |url=|accessdate=|newspaper=In Memory of Maniharsha Jyoti| publisher = Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad|year=1995}} Page 460.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Money, George Wigram Pocklington. (1917) ''Gurkhali Manual.'' Asian Educational Services. {{ISBN|81-206-1576-X}}, 9788120615762. Page 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign to reinstate Nepal Sambat as the national calendar began in the 1920s when [[Dharmaditya Dharmacharya]], a Buddhist and Nepal Bhasa activist based in [[Kolkata]], initiated a campaign to promote it as the national calendar. The movement was continued by language and cultural activists in Nepal with the advent of democracy following the ouster of the autocratic [[Rana dynasty]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Xinhua|first=|title= Nepal Sambat 1132 being celebrated in Nepal|url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2011-10-27/content_4186284.html|accessdate=12 April 2012|newspaper=China Daily|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand to make Nepal Sambat a national calendar intensified with the establishment of [[Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala]] in 1979. It organized rallies and public functions publicizing the importance of the era as a symbol of nationalism. Nepal Sambat has also emerged as a symbol to rally people against the suppression of their culture, language and literature by the politically dominant ruling classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Malla | first =K.

===Reinstated as national calendar===

[[File:Lakhu phalcha.jpg|thumb|200px|Lakhu Phalchā (shelter) at Maru where the sand carriers stopped to rest.]]
The Nepal Sambat movement achieved its first success on 18 November 1999 when the government declared the founder of the calendar, a trader of [[Kathmandu]] named [[Sankhadhar Sakhwa]] (संखधर साख्वा), a national hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joshi|first=Amar Prasad|title=Shankhadhar Sakhwa: Founder of Nepal Samvat|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=25573&amp;cat_id=10|accessdate=22 January 2012|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706163359/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=25573&amp;cat_id=10|archivedate=6 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2003, the Department of Postal Service issued a commemorative postage stamp depicting his portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.wnsstamps.ch/en/stamps/NP010.03?lang=en| title =NP010.03| work = | publisher = Universal Postal Union| date=| accessdate = 23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Sankhadhar was erected in [[Tansen]], [[Palpa District|Palpa]] in western Nepal on 28 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;''Sandhya Times'' (29 January 2012). Kathmandu: Artha Pithana Prakashan. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 2011, the government decided to bring Nepal Sambat into use as the country's national calendar following prolonged lobbying by cultural and social organizations, most prominently by [[Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pradhananga|first=Gyanendra Dhar|title=The sands of time|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2012/01/28/free-the-words/the-sands-of-time/230946.html|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and formed a taskforce to make recommendations on its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Govt to bring Nepal Sambat into use|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=37568|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=Republica|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All major newspapers now print Nepal Sambat along with other dates on their mastheads.

Nepal Sambat is a [[lunisolar calendar]] with 354 days in a normal year. An [[intercalary month]] named Anālā (अनाला) is added every three years to prevent the calendar from drifting with the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levy |first= Robert Isaac |date=1990 |title= Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal|chapter=A Catalogue of Annual Events and Their Distribution throughout the Lunar Year |publisher= University of California Press |pages=643–657|isbn=9780520069114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Year===

New Year's Day falls on the first day of the waxing moon during the [[Swanti (festival)|Swanti festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = Daniel | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfNepal/HistoryOfNepaldanielWright#page/n59/mode/2up| title = History of Nepal | work = | publisher = New Delhi: Asian Educational Services | year=1990| page= 34|accessdate = 7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, traders used to close their ledgers and open new account books on the first day of Nepal Sambat. [[Newars]] observe New Year's Day by performing [[Mha Puja]] ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: म्हपुजा), a ritual to purify and empower the soul for the coming New Year besides praying for longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Mha Puja today, Nepal Sambat 1132 being observed|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2011/10/27/top-story/mha-puja-today-nepal-sambat-1132-being-observed/342845.html|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=Ekantipur|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this ceremony, family members sit cross-legged in a row on the floor in front of [[mandala]]s (sand paintings) drawn for each person. Offerings are made to the mandala, and each family member is presented auspicious ritual food which includes boiled egg, smoked fish and rice wine during the [[Sagan (ceremony)|Sagan ceremony]]. Mha Puja and Nepal Sambat are also celebrated abroad where Nepalese have settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppguk.org/Activities-/-Events/ppguk-recent-activites.html|title=Mha Puja 2012 &amp; New Year Nepal Samvat 1133 Celebration|last=|first=|year=2012|website=Pasa Puchah Guthi UK|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130720024545/http://www.ppguk.org/Activities-/-Events/ppguk-recent-activites.html|archivedate=20 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor celebrations of the new year consist of cultural processions, pageants, and rallies. Participants dressed in [[traditional Newar clothing]] like tapālan, suruwā and hāku patāsi parade on the streets. Musical bands playing various kinds of drums take part in the processions. Streets and market squares are decorated with arches, gates, and banners bearing new year greetings. The president of Nepal also issues a message of greetings on the occasion of New Year's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Prez‚ Chairman extend Nepal Sambat New Year greetings |url= http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Prez%26sbquo%3B+Chairman+extend+Nepal+Sambat+New+Year+greetings&amp;NewsID=395950 |newspaper= The Himalayan Times |location=Kathmandu |publisher= |date=4 November 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public functions are held in which the prime minister and other government leaders participate.

'''''Madonna Enthroned''''', also known as the '''''Ognissanti Madonna''''', is a painting by the Italian late medieval artist [[Giotto di Bondone]], housed in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] of [[Florence, Italy]].

The painting has a traditional Christian subject, representing the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Christ Child]] seated on her lap, with saints and angels surrounding them on all sides. This particular representation of the Virgin is called a [[Maestà]], a popular representation at the time. It is often celebrated as the first painting of the [[Renaissance]] due to its newfound naturalism and escape from the constraints of [[Gothic art]].

It is generally dated to around 1310. While historians have had trouble finding specific information for indisputably attributing many of Giotto's works to the artist, ''Madonna Enthroned'' is one piece for which there are a few documents supporting its creation by Giotto.  There are many sources that show he spent many years living and creating in [[Florence]]. However, the main source that documents ''Madonna Enthroned'' specifically is artist [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s autobiography, ''I Commentarii'' (1447).  An earlier manuscript document of 1418 also attributes the painting to Giotto, but it is Ghiberti's autobiography that provides the most solid evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 676&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Giotto's later works, ''Madonna Enthroned'' was completed in [[Florence]], upon the artist's return to the city.  It was originally painted for the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]] Franciscan church in Florence.  Built for the [[Humiliati]], a small religious order at the time, the church had many acclaimed paintings designed for it.  Specifically, Giotto's ''Madonna Enthroned'' was designed for the high altar.

==Influences==
The ''Madonna Enthroned'' shows the numerous styles of art that influenced Giotto. In both the gold coloring used throughout the artwork and the flattened gold background, Giotto's art continued the traditional Italo-Byzantine style so popular in the proto-Renaissance time period.  The altarpiece represents a formalized representation of an icon, still retaining the stiffness of Byzantine art, and Giotto retained the hierarchy of scale, making the centralized Madonna and the Christ Child much larger in size than the surrounding saints and religious figures.

Giotto's figures however escape the bounds of Byzantine art.  His figures are weighty and are reminiscent of three-dimensional sculptures, such as that in classical Roman sculpture.  The Madonna's intricately decorated throne, which itself is an Italian Gothic design, has a very specific use of colored marble as a surface decoration.  This method of decoration, based on a style called Cosmatesque or Cosmati, was popular in Rome since the Early Christian period and in Tuscany in the Late Middle Ages.

There were, additionally, a number of specific artists whose styles heavily influenced ''The Ognissanti Madonna''.  The influence of [[Cimabue]], traditionally recognized as Giotto's teacher, is shown first in the very symmetrical composition of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, 603&lt;/ref&gt; Cimabue portrayed the same subject in his 1280 ''Virgin and Child Enthroned'', and both pieces share aspects of the Italo-Byzantine style, with Cimabue's having more Byzantine attributes.  Additionally, the two depictions of the angels' wings in Giotto and Cimabue's pieces clearly resemble each other. Both pieces share a similar, initial feeling of severity, yet there is more to each piece than the drama. Giotto adopted from his teacher the importance of, and the concern for, volume and forms in space.  

The tranquility of Giotto's figures resembled also the style of [[Pietro Cavallini]].  From this artist, who painted neo-Byzantine pieces, taking cues from both mosaics and frescos from Roman and Early Christian times, Giotto took important lessons in the technique of painting, and in rendering figures as statuesque and calm.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 686&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lastly, Giotto took cues from many contemporary sculptors, including [[Nicola Pisano|Nicola]] and [[Giovanni Pisano]], whose work shares influences of Northern Gothic art.  In the work of these artists, Giotto saw great, dramatic compositions that would certainly influence his ''Ognissanti Madonna''.

==Technique==
[[Giotto]] was the first artist to depict three-dimensional figures in western European art. Additionally, he used a much smaller space than other contemporary artists, further emphasizing the importance of the bodies in the artwork. Giotto did away with many aspects of Byzantine art that would flatten the painting.  Within [[Cimabue]]'s ''Virgin and Child Enthroned'', there is the use of gold tracing to delineate the folds of the fabric.  In contrast to this, Giotto's fabric folds are more realistic, and instead of lines he used light, shadow, and color to create the appearance of fabric.  Contours of the body underneath these fabric folds are also visible, specifically in the Virgin's knees and also around her breasts. 

Giotto used a value scale, a distinct range of light and darks, to create a sense of volume in his figures, giving them the slight smokiness that is usually characteristic of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and later Renaissance artists.

'''Old Swedish''' ([[Swedish language|Modern Swedish]]: ''fornsvenska'') is the name for two distinct stages of the Swedish language that were spoken in the [[Middle Ages]]: '''Early Old Swedish''' (''Klassisk fornsvenska''), spoken from around 1225 until 1375, and '''Late Old Swedish''' (''Yngre fornsvenska''), spoken from 1375 until 1526.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue, Michael D. ''Historical linguistics 2003: selected papers from the 16th International Conference on Historical Linguistics, Copenhagen, 11–15 August 2003''. John Benjamins Publishing Company 2005. p. 258. Accessed through [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Swedish developed from [[Old Norse#Old East Norse|Old East Norse]], the eastern dialect of [[Old Norse]]. The earliest forms of the Swedish and [[Danish language]]s, spoken between the years 800 and 1100, were dialects of Old East Norse and are referred to as ''[[Runic Swedish]]'' and ''Runic Danish'' because at the time all texts were written in the [[runic alphabet]]. The differences were only minute, however, and the dialects truly began to diverge around the 12th century, becoming Old Swedish and [[Old Danish]] in the 13th century. It is not known when exactly [[Old Gutnish]] and [[Elfdalian]] began to diverge from Swedish, but Old Gutnish diverged long before Old Danish did.

Early Old Swedish was markedly different from modern Swedish in that it had a more complex case structure and had not yet experienced a reduction of the gender system and thus had three genders. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases: [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]] and [[accusative]].

==Development==

===Early Old Swedish===
[[Image:Västgötalagen blad 21.jpg|thumb|right|A page of the ''[[Västgötalagen|Äldre Västgötalagen]]'' (Westrogothic law), a [[code of law|law code]] used in [[Västergötland]], from the 1280s]]

The writing of the [[Västgötalagen|Westrogothic law]] marked the beginning of Early Old Swedish (''klassisk fornsvenska'' or ''äldre fornsvenska''; 1225–1375), which had developed from Old East Norse. It was the first Swedish language document written in the [[Latin alphabet]], and its oldest fragments have been dated to around the year 1225.

Old Swedish was relatively stable during this period. The phonological and grammatical systems inherited from Old Norse were relatively well preserved and did not experience any major changes.

Most of the texts from the Early Old Swedish period were written in [[Latin]], as it was the language of knowledge and the [[Catholic Church|Church]]. However, Old Swedish was used as a literary language as well, and laws especially were written in it; of the 28 surviving manuscripts from this period, 24 contain law texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bandle, Oskar; Elmevik, Lennart; Widmark, Gun. ''The Nordic languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages. Volume 1.'' Walter de Gruyter 2002. Accessed through [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the knowledge of Old Swedish comes from these law texts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010126042400/http://www.algonet.se/~fransren/sprhist/klassforn.htm Klassisk- och yngre fornsvenska]. Svenska språkhistoria. Retrieved 2009-28-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to laws, some religious and poetic texts were also written in Old Swedish.

====Loanwords====

The Catholic Church and its various [[monasticism|monastic orders]] introduced many new [[Classical Greek|Greek]] and Latin [[loanword]]s into Old Swedish. Latin especially had an influence on the written language.&lt;ref name=grunbaun&gt;Grünbaun, Katharina. [http://www.sweden.se/upload/Sweden_se/otherlanguages/factsheets/SI/Svenska_spraket.pdf ''Svenska språket''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025181238/http://www.sweden.se/upload/Sweden_se/otherlanguages/factsheets/SI/Svenska_spraket.pdf |date=25 October 2012 }}. Svenska institutet.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Low German]] language also influenced Old Swedish due to the economic and political power of the [[Hanseatic League]] during the 13th and 14th centuries. Many German speakers immigrated to Swedish cities and worked in trade and administration. Accordingly, loanwords relating to warfare, trade, crafts and bureaucracy entered the Swedish language directly from Low German, along with some grammatical suffixes and conjunctions. The prefixes ''be-'', ''ge-'' and ''för-'' that can be found in the beginning of modern Swedish words came from the Low German ''be-'', ''ge-'' and ''vor-''. Some words were replaced with new ones: the native word for window, ''vindøgha'', was replaced with ''fönster'', ''eldhus'' (kitchen) was replaced with ''kök'' and ''gælda'' (to pay) with ''betala''.&lt;ref name=grunbaun /&gt; Some of these words still exist in Modern Swedish but are often considered archaic or dialectal; one example is the word ''vindöga'' (window). Many words related to seafaring were borrowed from Dutch.

The influence of Low German was so strong that the inflectional system of Old Swedish was largely broken down.&lt;ref&gt;Hird, Gladys; Huss, Göran; Hartman, Göran. ''Swedish: an elementary grammar reader''. Cambridge University Press 1980. p. 1. Accessed through [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Old Swedish===

In contrast to the stable Early Old Swedish, Late Old Swedish (''yngre fornsvenska''; 1375–1526) experienced many changes, including a simplification of the grammatical system and a [[vowel shift]], so that in the 16th century the language resembled modern Swedish more than before. The printing of the [[New Testament]] in Swedish in 1526 marked the starting point for modern Swedish.

In this period Old Swedish had taken in a large amount of new vocabulary primarily from Latin, Low German and Dutch. When the country became part of the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1397, many Danish scribes brought Danicisms into the written language.

==Orthography==
Old Swedish used some letters that are no longer found in modern Swedish: {{angle bracket|[[æ]]}} and {{angle bracket|[[ø]]}} were used for modern {{angle bracket|[[ä]]}} and {{angle bracket|[[ö]]}} respectively, and {{angle bracket|[[Thorn (letter)|þ]]}} could stand for both {{IPAslink|ð}} (''th'' as in the) and {{IPAslink|θ}} (''th'' as in thing). In the latter part of the 14th century {{angle bracket|þ}} was replaced with {{angle bracket|th}} and {{angle bracket|dh}}.

The [[grapheme]] {{angle bracket|i}} could stand for both the [[phoneme]]s {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} (e.g. ''siæl'' (soul), ''själ'' in modern Swedish). The graphemes {{angle bracket|u}}, {{angle bracket|v}}, and {{angle bracket|w}} were used interchangeably with the phonemes {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} (e.g. ''vtan'' (without), ''utan'' in modern Swedish), and {{angle bracket|w}} could also sometimes stand for the consonant-vowel combinations {{IPA|/vu/}} and {{IPA|/uv/}}: ''dwa'' (''duva'' or dove).

Certain abbreviations were used in writing, such as {{angle bracket|mꝫ}} for ''meþ'' (modern ''med'', with).&lt;ref&gt;Beukema, Frits H.; van der Wurff, Wim. ''Imperative clauses in generative grammar: studies in honour of Frits Beukema''. John Benjamins Publishing Company 2007. p. 195, note 14. Accessed through [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; The letter combinations {{angle bracket|aa}} and {{angle bracket|oe}} were often written so that one of the letters stood above the other as a smaller letter, which led to the development of the modern letters {{angle bracket|å}}, {{angle bracket|ä}}, and {{angle bracket|ö}}.

==Phonology==

The root syllable length in Old Swedish could be short (VC), long (V:C, VC:) or overlong (V:C:).&lt;ref&gt;[[Östen Dahl|Dahl, Östen]]; Koptjevskaja-Tamm, Maria. ''The Circum-Baltic languages: typology and contact''. John Benjamins Publishing Company 2001. Accessed through [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; During the Late Old Swedish period the short root syllables (VC) were lengthened and the overlong root syllables (V:C:) were shortened, so modern Swedish only has the combinations V:C and VC:. Unlike in modern Swedish, a short vowel in Old Swedish did not entail a long consonant.

There were eight [[vowel]]s in Early Old Swedish: {{IPA|/iː, yː, uː, oː, eː, aː, øː, ɛː/}}. A [[vowel shift]] (''stora vokaldansen'') occurred during the Late Old Swedish period, which had the following effects:

*{{IPA|[uː]}} became {{IPA|[ʉː]}} (''hūs'' {{IPA|[huːs]}} &gt; ''hus'' {{IPA|[hʉːs]}}, house)
*[oː] became [uː] (''bōk'' {{IPA|[boːk]}} &gt; ''bok'' {{IPA|[buːk]}}, book)
*[aː] became [oː] (''blā'' {{IPA|[blaː]}} &gt; blå {{IPA|[bloː]}}, blue)

The [[consonant]] sounds were largely the same as in modern Swedish, with the notable exceptions of {{IPAslink|ð}} and {{IPAslink|θ}}, which do not exist in modern Swedish.
The Modern Swedish tje-sound ([ɕ]) and sje-sound ([ɧ]) were probably [t͡ʃ] and [ʃ], respectively. A similar change can be seen from Old Spanish [t͡s/d͡z] and [ʃ/ʒ] to Modern Spanish [s/θ] and [x].

==Grammar==

===Nominal morphology===

====Early Old Swedish====
The most defining difference between Old Swedish and modern Swedish was the more complex grammatical system of the former. In Old Swedish nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases ([[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]] and [[accusative]]), whereas modern standard Swedish has reduced the case system to a common form and a genitive (some dialects retain distinct dative forms). There were also three [[grammatical gender]]s (masculine, feminine and neuter), still retained in many dialects today, but now reduced to two in the standard language, where the masculine and feminine have merged. These features of Old Swedish are still found in modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]]; the noun declensions are almost identical.

Noun [[declension]]s fell under two categories: weak and strong.&lt;ref name=altschw&gt;Noreen, Adolf: [http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/texts/oswed_noreen_about.html ''Altschwedische Grammatik, mit Einschluss des Altgutnischen'']. 1904. Retrieved 2009-28-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The weak masculine, feminine and neuter nouns had their own declensions and at least three groups of strong masculine nouns, three groups of strong feminine nouns and one group of strong neuter nouns can be identified. Below is an overview of the noun declension system:

'''The noun declension system'''&lt;ref name=altschw /&gt;

*Vowel stems (strong declension)
**a-stems
***a-stems
***ja-stems
***ia-stems
**ō-stems
***ō-stems
***jō-stems
***iō-stems
**i-stems
**u-stems
*Consonant n-stems (weak declension)
**n-stems
***an-stems
***ōn, ūn-stems
***īn-stems
*Consonant stems
** monosyllabic stems
** r-stems
** nd-stems

Some noun paradigms of the words ''fisker'' (fish), ''sun'' (son), ''siang'' (bed), ''skip'' (ship), ''biti'' (bit) and ''vika'' (week):&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Terje Faarlund|Faarlund, Jan Terje]].

====Late Old Swedish====

By the year 1500 the number of cases in Old Swedish had been reduced from four ([[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]] and [[accusative]]) to two (nominative and genitive). The dative case, however, lived on in a few [[Swedish dialects|dialects]] well into the 20th century.

Other major changes include the loss of a separate inflectional system for masculine and feminine nouns, pronouns and adjectives in the course of the 15th century, leaving only two genders in the standard Swedish language, although three genders are still common in many of the dialects. The old dative forms of the personal pronouns became the [[object (grammar)|object]] forms (''honom'', ''henne'', ''dem''; him, her, them) and ''-s'' became more common as the ending for the genitive singular.

===Adjectives===

Adjectives and certain numerals were inflected according to the gender and case the noun they modified was in.&lt;ref&gt;Pettersson, Gertrud. ''Svenska språket under sjuhundra år''. Lund 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Below is a table of the inflection of weak adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;Wischer, Hilse; Diewald, Gabriele. ''New reflections on grammaticalization''.

===Verbs===

Verbs in Old Swedish were conjugated according to person and number. There were four [[Germanic weak verb|weak verb]] conjugations and six groups of [[Germanic strong verb|strong verbs]].&lt;ref name=altschw /&gt; The difference between weak and strong verbs is in the way the [[past tense]] ([[preterite]]) is formed: strong verbs form it with a vowel shift in the root of the verb, while weak verbs form it with a dental suffix (þ, d or t).&lt;ref name=verbix&gt;[http://www.verbix.com/languages/oldswedish.shtml Germanic languages: conjugate Old Swedish verbs]. ''Verbix.com''. Retrieved 2009-28-10.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Late Old Swedish period the verbal conjugation system was simplified, and [[Agreement (linguistics)|verb agreement]] for person was lost.

====Strong verbs====
The verbs in the table below are ''bīta'' (bite), ''biūþa'' (offer), ''værþa'' (become), ''stiæla'' (steal), ''mæta'' (measure) and ''fara'' (go).&lt;ref name=verbix /&gt;

====Weak verbs====

Weak verbs are grouped into four classes:&lt;ref name=altschw /&gt;
*'''First conjugation''': verbs ending in ''-a(r)'', ''-ā(r)'' in the present tense. Most verbs belong to this class.
*'''Second conjugation''': verbs ending in ''-e(r)'', ''-æ(r)'' in the present tense.
*'''Third conjugation''': verbs ending in ''-i(r)'', ''-ø(r)'' in the present tense.
*'''Fourth conjugation''': these verbs have a more or less irregular conjugation. About twenty verbs belong to this class.

Inside the conjugation classes the weak verbs are also categorised into further three classes:&lt;ref name=altschw /&gt;
*'''I''': those ending in ''-þe'' in the preterite
*'''II''': those ending in ''-de'' in the preterite
*'''III''': those ending in ''-te'' in the preterite

===Syntax===
[[Word order]] was less restricted in Old Swedish than modern Swedish due to complex verbal morphology. Both referential and nonreferential [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]] could be left out as verbal structures already conveyed the necessary information, in much the same way as in languages such as Spanish and [[Latin]].

In [[noun phrase|nominal phrases]] the [[genitive case|genitive]] attribute could stand both before and after the word it modified, i.e. one could say ''his house'' or ''house his''. The same was true for pronouns and adjectives (''that house'' or ''house that''; ''green pasture'' or ''pasture green''). During the Late Old Swedish period the usage of the genitive attribute became increasingly more restricted, and it nearly always came to be placed before the word it modified, so in modern Swedish one would usually only say ''hans hus'' (his house), or in some dialects or manners of emphasis, ''huset hans'', but almost never ''hus hans''. Although, this too has lived on in some dialects, like in [[Västgötska]], where the use of "mor din" (mother yours) has been common.&lt;ref&gt;In Västgötska, "molin" can also be used instead of "mor din". [[:sv:Västgötska#K-N|Västgötska words and expressions (Swedish)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal pronouns===

==Examples==

===Västgötalagen===
This is an extract from the [[Västgötalagen|Westrogothic law]] (''Västgötalagen''), which is the oldest continuous text written in the Swedish language, and was compiled during the early 13th century. The text marks the beginning of Old Swedish.

:''Dræpær maþar svænskan man eller smalenskæn, innan konongsrikis man, eigh væstgøskan, bøte firi atta ørtogher ok þrettan markær ok ænga ætar bot. [...] Dræpar maþær danskan man allæ noræn man, bøte niv markum. Dræpær maþær vtlænskan man, eigh ma frid flyia or landi sinu oc j æth hans. Dræpær maþær vtlænskæn prest, bøte sva mykit firi sum hærlænskan man. Præstær skal i bondalaghum væræ. Varþær suþærman dræpin ællær ænskær maþær, ta skal bøta firi marchum fiurum þem sakinæ søkir, ok tvar marchar konongi.''

'''Modern Swedish''':

:''Dräper man en svensk eller en smålänning, en man ifrån konungariket, men ej en västgöte, så bötar man tretton marker och åtta örtugar, men ingen mansbot. [...] Dräper man en dansk eller en norrman bötar man nio marker. Dräper man en utländsk man, skall man inte bannlysas utan förvisas till sin ätt. Dräper man en utländsk präst bötar man lika mycket som för en landsman. En präst räknas som en fri man. Om en sörlänning dräps eller en engelsman, skall han böta fyra marker till målsäganden och två marker till konungen.''

'''English''':

:''If someone slays a [[Suiones|Swede]] or a [[Småland]]er, a man from the kingdom, but not a West [[Geats|Geat]], he will pay eight örtugar and thirteen marks, but no [[wergild]]. [...] If someone slays a [[Danes (ancient people)|Dane]] or a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]], he will pay nine marks. If someone slays a foreigner, he shall not be banished and have to flee to his [[Norse clan|clan]]. If someone slays a foreign priest, he will pay as much as for a fellow countryman. A priest counts as a free man. If a Southerner is slain or an [[Englishman]], he shall pay four marks to the plaintiff and two marks to the king.''

===The Life of Saint Eric===

This text about [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric IX]] (ca. 1120–1160) can be found in the [[Codex Bureanus]], a collection of Old Swedish manuscripts from the mid-14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/tmp/oi_gordon_taylor_corpus.html Gordon and Taylor Old Norse readings]. ''Lexicon.ff.cuni.cz''. Retrieved 2009-28-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Hǣr viliom wī medh Gudz nādhom sighia medh faam ordhom aff thø̄m hælgha Gudz martire Sancto Ērīco, som fordum war konungher ī Swērīke. Bādhe aff ǣt ok ædle han war swā fast aff konunga slækt som aff androm Swērīkis høfdingiom.

Translation:

:''Here we want to say with God's grace a few words about that holy God's martyr Saint Eric, who was earlier the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]]. In both heritage and nobility he was fastly of royal extraction as other Swedish leaders. Since the realm was without a leader and he was beloved by all of the land's nobility and all of the common people, the commoners chose him as King with all of their good will, and sat him reverentially on the King's throne at [[Uppsala]].''

==Etymology==
The term ''parrhesia'' first appears in Greek literature in Euripides and can be found in ancient Greek texts throughout the end of the fourth century and during fifth century B.C.&lt;ref name = "foucault" /&gt; The term is borrowed from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] παρρησία ''parrhēsía'' (πᾶν "all" and ῥῆσις "utterance, speech") meaning literally "to speak everything" and by extension "to speak freely", "to speak boldly", or "boldness".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|parrhsi/a|παρρησία|cite}}&lt;/ref&gt; It implies not only freedom of speech, but the obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.

==Usage in ancient Greece==
In ancient Greece, rhetoric and '''parrhesia''' were understood to be in opposition to each other through the dialogues written by [[Plato]]. There are two major philosophies during this period, one being [[Sophistry]] and one being [[Dialectic]]. 

Sophistry is most commonly associated with the use of rhetoric or means of persuasion to teach or persuade an audience. In its opposition is the practice of dialectic, supported by Plato and his mentor Socrates, which uses dialogue to break apart complex issues in search of absolute truth or knowledge. In Plato's writings, specifically [[Gorgias]], the term ''parrhesia'' is more closely associated with dialectic meaning that it is "free speech" and not rhetoric or manipulation. 

Parrhesia was a fundamental component of the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]] of [[Classical Athens]]. In [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|assemblies]] and the [[Athenian law court (classical period)|courts]] Athenians were free to say almost anything, and in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre]], playwrights such as [[Aristophanes]] made full use of the right to ridicule whomever they chose.&lt;ref name="wallace"&gt;{{Citation | first = Robert W | last = Wallace | contribution = The Power to Speak — and not to listen – in Ancient Athens | editor1-first = Ineke | editor1-last = Sluiter | editor2-first = Ralph Mark | editor2-last = Rosen | year = 2002 | title= Free Speech in Classical Antiquity | pages = 222–3 | publisher = Brill}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere there were limits to what might be said; freedom to discuss politics, morals, religion, or to criticize people would depend on context: by whom it was made, and when, and how, and where.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John Willoby | last = Roberts | year = 1984 | title = City of Sokrates | page = 148 | publisher = Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If a man was seen as immoral, or his views went contrary to popular opinion, then there were great risks involved in making use of such an unbridled freedom of speech, as [[Socrates]] found out when he was sentenced to death for not adoring Athens' gods and for corrupting the young.&lt;ref name="wallace"/&gt; 

=== Cynic philosophers ===
{{main article|Cynicism (philosophy)}}

Parrhesia was a central concept for the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic philosophers]], as epitomized in the shameless speech of [[Diogenes of Sinope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Luis E | last = Navia | title = Diogenes the Cynic | page = 179 | publisher = Humanity Books}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Epicureans ===
{{main article|Epicureans}}
Parrhesia was also used by Epicureans in a friendly manner of frank criticism during teaching Epicurean philosophy and offering psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;6Konstan D, Clay D and Glad CE: Philodemus: On frank criticism (Peri parrhesias). Society of Biblical Literature, Atlanta, USA, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament use==
A related use of parrhesia is found in the Greek [[New Testament]], where it means "bold speech", the ability of believers to hold their own in discourse before political and religious authorities (e.g. Acts 4:13: "Now when they saw the boldness [την παρρησίαν] of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized them as companions of Jesus."). It is also used to describe the reply Jesus made to the [[Pharisees]].&lt;ref name = Burton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120211164007/http://www.drbilllong.com/EvenMoreWords/ParrhesiaII.html | first = William 'Bill' | last = Long | contribution = Parrhesia and Earliest Christianity | title = Even more words | date = December 1, 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Heinrich | last = Schlier | contribution = παρρησία, παρρησιάζομαι | title = Theological Dictionary of the New Testament | editor1-first = Gerhard | editor1-last = Kittel | editor2-first = Gerhard | editor2-last = Friedrich | place = Ann Arbor | publisher = Eerdmans | year = 1967 | volume = V | pages = 871ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in rabbinic Jewish writings==
Parrhesia appears in [[midrash|Midrashic]] literature as a condition for the transmission of [[Torah]]. Connoting open and public communication, ''parrhesia'' appears in combination with the term, [[wikt:δῆμος|δῆμος]] (''dimus'', short for ''dimosia''), translated ''coram publica'', in the public eye, i.e. open to the public&lt;ref&gt;A meaning found in ''Sylloge lnscriptionum Graecum'', 2nd edition, ed. Diltenberger 1888-1901, no.807, an inscription from after 138 C. E.&lt;/ref&gt; As a mode of communication it is repeatedly described in terms analogous to a [[Commons]]. ''Parrhesia'' is closely associated with an ownerless wilderness of primary mytho-geographic import, the ''Midbar Sinai'' in which the Torah was initially received. The dissemination of Torah thus depends on its teachers cultivating a nature which is as open, ownerless, and sharing as that wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;''Bamidbar Rabbah'' 1:7&lt;/ref&gt; The term is important to advocates of [[Open Source Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Varady | first =Aharon|title= ‘Make yourself into a Maqom Hefker’: Teachings on Open Source in Judaism | type = sourcesheet | url = http://opensiddur.org/development/open-siddur/make-yourself-into-a-maqom-hefker-teachings-on-open-source-in-judaism-sourcesheet/ | publisher = The Open Siddur Project | accessdate = 29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the text from the [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]] where the term ''dimus parrhesia'' appears (see bolded text).

והם הלכו במדבר. התורה נתנה לדמוס כומר במקום של אדמות. השאלה ניתנה בארץ ישראל. הם אמרו לאומות העולם שאין להם חלק בכך. מדוע לא קמה התורה בארץ ישראל? לא לתת אמון לאומות העולם, ללמוד כי חייתי בארצם וכי הם לא קיבלו אותנו. כלומר, לא לתת מחלוקת בין השבטים, כי לא נאמר בארצי שהתורה ניתנה, וזה אומר שבארצי נתתי את התורה. בשלושה דברים, התורה מושווה למדבר, האש והמים, כדי לומר לך: "אמא מיה וילי!.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mekhilta de Rebbi Yishmael|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta.19.2.7?lang=he&amp;layout=lines&amp;sidebarLang=all|website=the Sefaria Project|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::Torah was given over ''dimus '''parrhesia''''' in a ''maqom hefker'' (a place belonging to no one). For had it been given in the Land of Israel, they would have had cause to say to the nations of the world, “you have no share in it.” Thus was it given ''dimus '''parrhesia''''', in a place belonging to no one: “Let all who wish to receive it, come and receive it!” Why was the Torah not given in the land of Israel? In order that the peoples of the world should not have the excuse for saying: `Because it was given in Israel's land, therefore we have not accepted it. Another reason: To avoid causing dissension among the tribes [of Israel]. Else one might have said: In my land the Torah was given. And the other might have said: In my land the Torah was given. Therefore, the Torah was given in the ''Midbar'' (wilderness), ''dimus '''parrhesia''''', in a place belonging to no one. To three things the Torah is likened: to the ''Midbar'' (wilderness), to fire, and to water. This is to tell you that just as these three things are free to all who come into the world, so also are the words of the Torah free to all who come into the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780827610033 | volume = Tractate Baḥodesh | chapter = 5 | at = on Shemot 20:2 | publisher = JHU | ISBN = 978-0-82761003-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Israel|Israeli]] Hebrew,"parrhesia" (פרהסיא, פרהסיה) means simply "in public".

== Modern scholarship ==
[[Michel Foucault]] developed the concept of parrhesia as a mode of [[discourse]] in which one speaks openly and truthfully about one's opinions and ideas without the use of rhetoric, manipulation, or generalization.&lt;ref name="foucault"/&gt; Foucault's use of parrhesia, he tells us, is troubled by our modern day [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] model of evidential necessity. For [[Descartes]], [[truth]] is the same as the undeniable.  Whatever can be doubted must be, and, thus, speech that is not examined or criticized does not necessarily have a valid relation to truth.

There are several conditions upon which the traditional Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] notion of parrhesia relies. One who uses parrhesia is only recognized as doing so if he or she holds a credible relationship to the truth, if he serves as [[critic]] to either himself or popular opinion or [[culture]], if the revelation of this truth places him in a position of danger and he persists in speaking the truth, nevertheless, as he feels it is his moral, social, and/or political [[obligation]]. Further, in a public situation, a user of parrhesia must be in a social position less empowered than those to whom he is revealing.

Foucault (1983) sums up the Ancient Greek concept of parrhesia as such:
{{Quote | So you see, the parrhesiastes is someone who takes a risk. Of course, this risk is not always a risk of life. When, for example, you see a friend doing something wrong and you risk incurring his anger by telling him he is wrong, you are acting as a parrhesiastes. In such a case, you do not risk your life, but you may hurt him by your remarks, and your friendship may consequently suffer for it. If, in a political debate, an orator risks losing his popularity because his opinions are contrary to the majority's opinion, or his opinions may usher in a political scandal, he uses parrhesia. Parrhesia, then, is linked to courage in the face of danger: it demands the courage to speak the truth in spite of some danger. And in its extreme form, telling the truth takes place in the "game" of life or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = Fearless Speech | pages = 15–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and
{{Quote | To summarize the foregoing, parrhesia is a kind of verbal activity where the speaker has a specific relation to truth through frankness, a certain relationship to his own life through danger, a certain type of relation to himself or other people through criticism (self-criticism or criticism of other people), and a specific relation to moral law through freedom and duty. More precisely, parrhesia is a verbal activity in which a speaker expresses his personal relationship to truth, and risks his life because he recognizes truth-telling as a duty to improve or help other people (as well as himself). In parrhesia, the speaker uses his freedom and chooses frankness instead of persuasion, truth instead of falsehood or silence, the risk of death instead of life and security, criticism instead of flattery, and moral duty instead of self-interest and moral apathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = Fearless Speech | pages = 19–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault (1984) sums up that:
{{Quote | The Parrhesiastes is the person who says everything. Thus, as an example, in his discourse "On the Embassy," Demosthenes says: It is necessary to speak with parrhesia, without holding back at anything without concealing anything. Similarly, in the "First Philippic," he takes up exactly the same term and says: I will tell you what I think without concealing anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = The Courage of Truth | page = 9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
This characteristic decorative motif probably originated in [[Hungary]], and by the beginning of the 20th century it became one of the most recognisable decorative patterns in the [[Podhale]] region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
The origin of the term is unclear, it is possibly related to old-Polish verbs ''parznąć'' and ''parznić'' meaning to make some object filthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=cEaMLpuIfhYC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Joanna+Dziadowiec,+Zeszyty+Naukowe+TDUJ2010&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ktt5Xypaib&amp;sig=mFsxIhSopc6BfJ6W5XwnukT0t2I&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvw73L4YLRAhWBqywKHYKmD7AQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Joanna%20Dziadowiec,%20Zeszyty%20Naukowe%20TDUJ2010&amp;f=false|title=Góralskie reprezentacje, czyli rzecz o Podhalanach i ich kulturze|last=Dziadowiec|first=Joanna|work=Zeszyty Naukowe Towarzystwa Doktorantów Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=Tendera|editor-first=Paulina|location=Kraków|pages=67–90|language=pl|quote=|via=|issue=numer specjalny 1/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the name also applied to various other objects popular in everyday life of the Goral people, including wooden forms used in cheese production and heart-shaped motifs used in [[wood carving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strój górali podhalańskich = The dress of Podhale highlanders|last=Trebunia|first=Stanisława|last2=Kubienia|first2=Jacek|last3=Bielatowicz|first3=Anna|date=2011|publisher=Fundacja Braci Golec|year=|isbn=9788392551812|series=Stroje Ludowe w Karpatach Polskich, t. 4|location=Kraków; Milówka|pages=250|language=Polish and English|translator-last=Domańska|translator-first=Monika|oclc=804547001|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;The origin of the pattern itself is also unclear, some authors believe that it was imported from [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the second half of the 19th century, the first parzenicas made in the Tatras were but simple string loops, used for reinforcing cuts in front of cloth trousers. Such loops prevented wool fabric from fraying. With time local craftsmen adopted navy blue or red string and added additional loops to create an ornamental design rather than a simple loop. With time appliqué design was replaced with embroidery and more colours were added.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nowak-Hermanowicz|first=Krystyna|date=2014|title=The Costume|url=|journal=Ethnologia Polona|volume= 35|pages=101–123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Members of the 'Wiyrchowianie' folklore group in Podhale costume.jpg|thumb|Folk costumes from [[Podhale]], parzenica embroidery on the men`s trousers]]
The parzenica [[embroidery]] (also called ''cyfra'') dates back to the mid-19th century. Initially they were simple string loops, used for reinforcing cuts in front of cloth trousers. They had practical functions and protected the cloth from fraying. The "Knightly knot" is a decorative motif laid in three-loop of string, characteristic for highlander's male costume,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulkiewicz|first=Olga|year=1955|title=Parzenice gorczańskie|url=http://www.cyfrowaetnografia.pl/dlibra/editions-content?id=4061|journal=Polska Sztuka Ludowa - Konteksty|volume=9 |issue=4|pages=217–222|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; often used as base for parzenica. It is one of the eldest type of parzenicas, present in the traditional costume of highladers of [[Beskid Sądecki]], [[Gorce Mountains]] and other areas.

The modern look parzenica got from those [[tailor]]s who began using red or navy blue string, simultaneously increasing the number of loops. Later the appliqué design was replaced with embroidery. Using [[wool]]len [[yarn]] allowed the parzenica to become more colourful and eventually it become a stand-alone trouser ornamentation, developed by talented tailors and [[embroider]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birnbaum's Eastern Europe|last=Birnbaum|first=Alexandra Mayes|publisher=HarperPerennial|year=1992|isbn=9780062780836|location=|pages=625|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multilingualism, including multilingual societies as well as individuals who speak more than one language, is common. Individual polyglots or hyperpolyglots speak, study, or use large numbers of languages. In rare cases, polyglot savants have mental disabilities, but are able to learn many languages.

== Multilingual societies ==
{{main|Multilingualism}}
Most [[nation state]]s are home to multiple [[ethnic group]]s and multiple [[language]]s, and most of the world's population is bilingual or multilingual. In other words, only a minority of the world's peoples are monolingual&lt;ref name="LSA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Valdés|first=Guadalupe|title=Multilingualism|url=http://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/multilingualism|website=Linguistic Society of America|year=2012|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal surveys suggest that the number of languages spoken in multilingual societies is typically between two and six languages.&lt;ref name="Hudson"/&gt; However, there is a lack of consensus on such numbers due to the lack of shared definitions of multilingualism and the difficulty of differentiating among [[Variety (linguistics)|language varieties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Vivian|title=Second Language Learning and Language Teaching|year=2008|publisher=Hodder Education|isbn=978-0-340-95876-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polyglots and hyperpolyglots ==
{{further|List of polyglots}}
Some individuals speak, study, or otherwise use large numbers of languages. One notable hyperpolyglot was Cardinal [[Giuseppe Caspar Mezzofanti]], an Italian priest reputed to have spoken anywhere from 30 to 72 languages.&lt;ref name="Erard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hudson"/&gt; Individuals who consider themselves polyglots generally speak, read, or otherwise use five or more languages. In some cases, the number can be as high as several dozen.

Many polyglots and hyperpolyglots become multilingual by [[Second-language acquisition|studying languages]].&lt;ref name="Erard"/&gt; [[Language proficiency]] and learning success vary among individuals. [[Neuroscience of multilingualism]] points to possible differences among learners. One theory suggests that a spike in a baby's testosterone levels while in the uterus can increase brain asymmetry, which may relate to music and language ability, among other effects.&lt;ref name="Leland"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leland|first=John|authorlink=John Leland (journalist)|title=Adventures of a Teenage Polyglot|work=The New York Times|date=9 March 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/nyregion/a-teenage-master-of-languages-finds-online-fellowship.html?_r=1|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Study and motivation also affect learning. People learning multiple languages may optimize their learning strategies, making it easier to learn subsequent languages. They may also experience [[Language transfer|positive transfer]] – the process by which it becomes easier to learn additional languages if the [[grammar]] or [[vocabulary]] of the new language is similar to those of languages already spoken. On the other hand, students may also experience negative transfer – interference from languages learned at an earlier stage of development while learning a new language later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavlenko|first=Aneta|title=Can a second language help you learn a third?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/life-bilingual/201506/can-second-language-help-you-learn-third|website=Psychology Today: Life as a Bilingual|date=2 June 2015|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Association of Hyperpolyglots represents those with demonstrable hyperpolyglotic language proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://polyglotassociation.org International Association of Hyperpolyglots] Organisational Profile. Accessed 7 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=April 2017}}

Hyperpolyglots speak a larger number of languages and tend to show an above average ability to learn and speak languages. Linguistic expert [[Michael Erard]] says that while there are many polyglots who know six languages, the number drops off above this number. Based on the numbers, he says that when people know eleven languages fluently, it puts them in the hyperpolyglot category.&lt;ref&gt;Steinmetz, Katy http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/30/are-you-a-hyperpolyglot-the-secrets-of-language-superlearners/ Are You A Hyperpolyglot: the secrets of language superlearners], ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polyglot savant syndrome ==
While the term "savant" generally refers to an individual with a natural and/or innate talent for a particular field, people diagnosed with [[savant syndrome]] are typically individuals with significant mental disabilities who demonstrate profound and [[Child prodigy|prodigious]] capacities and/or abilities far in excess of what would be considered normal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9990844|year=1999|last1=Miller|first1=LK|title=The savant syndrome: Intellectual impairment and exceptional skill|volume=125|issue=1|pages=31–46|journal=Psychological Bulletin|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.1.31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2003.11.002|title=Comparing the intelligence profiles of savant and nonsavant individuals with autistic disorder|year=2004|last1=Bolte|first1=S|journal=Intelligence|volume=32|issue=2|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally including the capacity for languages. The condition is associated with an increased memory capacity, which would aid in the storage and retrieval of knowledge of a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Treffert|first=Darold A.|date=2009-05-27|title=The savant syndrome: an extraordinary condition. A synopsis: past, present, future|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=364|issue=1522|pages=1351–1357|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0326|issn=0962-8436|pmc=2677584|pmid=19528017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, for example, [[Neil Smith (linguist)|Neil Smith]] and Ianthi-Maria Tsimpli described Christopher, a man with non-verbal [[IQ]] scores between 40 and 70, who learned sixteen languages. Christopher was born in 1962 and approximately six months after his birth was diagnosed with brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=Elizabeth|date=1997|title=On language savants and the structure of the mind|url=https://crl.ucsd.edu/bates/papers/pdf/langsav.pdf|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|pages=163–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being institutionalized because he was unable to take care of himself, Christopher had a verbal IQ of 89, was able to speak English with no impairment, and could learn subsequent languages with apparent ease. This facility with language and communication is considered unusual among savants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Neil|last2=Tsimpli|first2=Ianthi-Maria|title=Linguistic modularity?

'''Postmodern law''', and postmodern jurisprudence, relates to interpretations of the legal system using [[postmodern philosophy]] and the theories of [[postmodernism]].  It also relevant to law within the context of the [[postmodern]] era.  Since the mid-1990s Annual meetings of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] have focused on the inclusion of postmodern interpretative strategies at these meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31436150|title=Postmodern legal movements : law and jurisprudence at century's end|last=Gary.|first=Minda,|date=1995|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=0814755100|location=New York|oclc=31436150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern interpretations of the law can involve critically considering legal inequalities connected to [[gender]], [[Class (social)|class]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] and [[ethnicity]] by acknowledging "diversity and multiplicity".  Critical practices connected to postmodern philosophy, such as [[critical literacy]] and [[deconstruction]], can be used as an interpretative tool to ensure that a range of different and [[Diversity (politics)|diverse]] values and norms are acknowledged or considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173368722|title=Sociology of law : visions of a scholarly tradition|last=Mathieu.|first=Deflem,|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521857253|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=173368722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is speculated that the term originated with the rise of the [[Four Asian Tigers]] across Asia, in which rapid economic growth may have contributed to a corresponding rise in consumerist or [[Nouveau riche|materialistic]] attitudes and upper classes investing heavily in their children, who might subsequently become accustomed to material wealth and domestic help.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca |date=2012 |title=Empiricism and analytical tools for 21 Century applied linguistics: selected papers from the XXIX International Conference of the Spanish Association of Applied Linguistics (AESLA)|page=451|ISBN=9788490121542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mainland China, the resultant phenomenon, often attributed to the former [[one-child policy]], is known as the '[[Little Emperor Syndrome]]'. A combination of [[helicopter parent]]ing and presence of [[Domestic worker]]s, allowing middle-class parents to work, can contribute to their children being [[Spoiled brat|spoilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong|first=Bill|title=Monster/Helicopter Parents and Their Children's Independence|url=http://otconnections.aota.org/community_blogs/user_blogs/b/humancalculatorot/archive/2011/02/03/monster-helicopter-parents-and-their-children-s-independence.aspx|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widening income gap in Hong Kong, along with concerns over democracy and social inequality, also reflects the perceived attitudes of the 'elite' classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/28/hong-kongs-pro-democracy-movement-is-about-inequality-the-elite-knows-it |title=Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement is about inequality.

The '''Prix de Rome''' ({{IPA-fr|pʁi də ʁɔm|pron}}) or '''Grand Prix de Rome'''&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Grand orx}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French scholarship for arts students, initially for painters and sculptors, that was established in 1663 during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France]]. Winners were awarded a bursary that allowed them to stay in Rome for three to five years at the expense of the state. The prize was extended to architecture in 1720, music in 1803, and engraving in 1804. The prestigious award was abolished in 1968 by [[André Malraux]], the Minister of Culture.

==History==
The Prix de Rome was initially created for painters and sculptors in 1663 in France during the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. It was an annual [[bursary]] for promising artists having proved their talents by completing a very difficult elimination contest. The prize, organised by the ''[[Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture]]'' (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture), was open to their students. From 1666, the award winner could win a stay of three to five years at the [[Palazzo Mancini]] in Rome at the expense of the King of France. In 1720, the Académie Royale d’Architecture began a prize in architecture. Six painters, four sculptors, and two architects&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S. "Prix de Rome", ''Grove Dictionary of Art online''&lt;/ref&gt; would be sent to the [[French Academy in Rome]] founded by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] from 1666.

Expanded after 140 years into five categories, the contest started in 1663 as two categories: painting and sculpture.  Architecture was added in 1720.  In 1803, music was added, and after 1804 there was a ''prix'' for engraving as well. The primary winner took the "First Grand Prize" (called the ''agréé'')&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Michael. ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Second Prizes" were awarded to the runners-up.

In 1803, [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] moved the French Academy in Rome to the [[Villa Medici]] with the intention of preserving an institution once threatened by the [[French Revolution]]. At first, the villa and its gardens were in a sad state, and they had to be renovated in order to house the winners of the Prix de Rome. In this way, he hoped to retain for young French artists the opportunity to see and copy the masterpieces of antiquity and the Renaissance.

[[Jacques-Louis David]], having failed to win the prize three years in a row, considered suicide. [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Ernest Chausson]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] attempted the Prix de Rome, but did not gain recognition.  Ravel tried a total of five times to win the prize, and the last failed attempt in 1905 was so controversial that it led to a complete reorganization of the administration at the [[Paris Conservatory]].

During World War II (1939–45) the prize winners were accommodated in the [[Villa Paradiso]] in Nice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://enligne.cg06.fr/jean-moulin/bottaro.html|last=Moulin|first=Jean|year=2014|publisher=Conseil général des Alpes-Maritimes|title=Nice, cité-refuge ?|accessdate=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Prix de Rome was abolished in 1968 by [[André Malraux]], who was Minister of Culture at the time. Since then, a number of contests have been created, and the academies, together with the [[Institut de France]], were merged by the State and the Minister of Culture. Selected residents now have an opportunity for study during an 18-month (sometimes 2-year) stay at The Academy of France in Rome, which is accommodated in the Villa Medici.

The heyday of the Prix de Rome was during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, ''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; It was later imitated by the [[Abd-el-Tif prize|Prix Abd-el-Tif]] and the [[Villa Abd-el-Tif]] in Algiers, 1907–1961, and later [[Prix d'Indochine]] including a bursary to visit the [[École des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine]] in [[Hanoi]], 1920–1939, and bursary for residence at the [[Casa de Velázquez]] in Madrid, 1929–present.

&lt;ref name=Foot03&gt;From 1767 through 1772, the winners of the Prix de Rome were deprived of the usual scholarship that funded their trips to Rome; this occurred because of the vengeance exacted by [[Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]] in an enormous abuse of his power. Having quarreled with the Académie d'Architecture, Poisson de Vendières sent his personal manservants instead to Rome instead of the winners of the Grand Prix.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot04&gt;Carried over from 1771.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot05&gt;In 1773 the funding for the scholarship to Rome was reestablished for architects through the generosity of the Abbé Terray, successor of the Marquis de Marigny.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot06&gt;1775 was the last year that a third prize (Troisieme Prix) was awarded.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot07&gt;Carried over from 1778.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot8A&gt;Fontaine would never win the Prix de Rome; however, a space at the Mancini Palace opened up in 1787 due to the delay in awarding the prize for that year, and Fontaine became the resident ''pensionnaire'', remaining in Rome until 1790.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot08&gt;Carried over from 1787.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot9A&gt;"The projected entrants boycotted the contest by renouncing their status of students until the Académie adopted the changes they demanded in the old regulations.''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Foot09&gt;From 1794–96 no competitions were held, since the Académies established by the Ancien Régime had been abolished by the Republican government. They were re-established by decree of 28 October 1796 under a new body known as the [[Institut de France]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prix de Rome (Netherlands)==
{{main article|Prix de Rome (Netherlands)}}

A Prix de Rome was also established in the [[Kingdom of Holland]] by [[Louis Bonaparte|Lodewijk Napoleon]] to award young artists and architects. During the years 1807–1810 prize winners were sent to Paris and onwards to Rome for study. In 1817, after the [[Netherlands]] had gained its independence, [[William I of the Netherlands|King Willem I]] restarted the prize; though it took until 1823 before the new "Royal Academies" of Amsterdam and Antwerp could organize the juries. Suspended in 1851 it was reinstated in 1870 by [[William III of the Netherlands]]. Since then the winners have been selected by the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam under the main headings of architecture and the visual arts.

==Prix de Rome (Belgium)==
{{main article|Prix de Rome (Belgium)}}

The Belgian Prix de Rome (Dutch: Prijs van Rome) is an award for young artists, created in 1832, following the example of the original French Prix de Rome. The [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp]] organised the prize until 1920, when the national government took over. The first prize is also sometimes called the Grand Prix de Rome. There were distinct categories for architecture, painting, sculpture and music.

{{Renaissance}}

The '''Renaissance''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|r|ᵻ|ˈ|n|eɪ|s|ən|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|r|ɛ|n|ə|ˈ|s|ɑː|n|s}})&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-fr|ʁənɛsɑ̃s}}, from {{lang-fr|Renaissance}} "re-birth", {{lang-it|Rinascimento}} {{IPA-it|rinaʃʃiˈmento|}}, from ''rinascere'' "to be reborn" {{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: "Renaissance" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[periodization|period]] in [[History of Europe|European history]], covering the span between the 14th and 17th centuries. It is an extension of the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bdIBlQXSKi8C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=renaissance+as+extension+of+middle+ages#v=onepage&amp;q=renaissance%20as%20extension%20of%20middle%20ages&amp;f=false|title=Forever Young: A Cultural History of Longevity|isbn=9781861891549|last1=Boia|first1=Lucian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is bridged by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] to [[modern history]]. It grew in fragments, with the very first traces found seemingly in [[Italy]], coming to cover much of Europe, for some scholars marking the beginning of the [[modern age]].

The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its own invented version of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]], derived from the concept of Roman [[Humanitas]] and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of [[Protagoras]], who said that "Man is the measure of all things." This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Early examples were the development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in [[oil painting]] and the recycled knowledge of how to make [[concrete]]. Although the invention of [[Movable type#Metal movable type in Europe|metal movable type]] sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe: the very first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of [[Dante]] and the paintings of [[Giotto]].

As a cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to [[Petrarch]]; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in [[painting]]; and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational reform]]. In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of [[diplomacy]], and in science to an increased reliance on observation and [[inductive reasoning]]. Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term "Renaissance man".&lt;ref&gt;BBC Science and Nature, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' Retrieved May 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC History, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' Retrieved May 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance began in [[Florence]], Italy, in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P., ''The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time: its political structure; the patronage of its dominant family, the [[House of Medici|Medici]];&lt;ref name="strathern"&gt;Strathern, Paul ''The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. {{ISBN|5-85050-825-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the migration of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholars]] and texts to Italy following the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Turkish people|Ottoman Turks]].&lt;ref name=Britannica1&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Renaissance'', 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Har, Michael H.

The Renaissance has a long and complex [[historiography]], and, in line with general scepticism of discrete [[periodization]]s, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the "Renaissance" and individual culture heroes as "Renaissance men", questioning the usefulness of ''Renaissance'' as a term and as a historical delineation.&lt;ref name = "brotton"/&gt; The [[Art history|art historian]] [[Erwin Panofsky]] observed of this resistance to the concept of "Renaissance":

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the [[Italian Renaissance]] has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'' 1969:38; Panofsky's chapter "'Renaissance— self-definition or self-deception?" succinctly introduces the historiographical debate, with copious footnotes to the literature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some observers have called into question whether the Renaissance was a cultural "advance" from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and [[nostalgia]] for [[classical antiquity]],&lt;ref name="huizinga"&gt;[[Johan Huizinga|Huizanga, Johan]], ''[[The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919, trans. 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; while social and economic historians, especially of the ''[[longue durée]]'', have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras,&lt;ref name="starn" /&gt; which are linked, as Panofsky observed, "by a thousand ties".&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky 1969:6.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--not mainstream:Indeed, some have called for an end to the use of the term, which they see as a product of [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]] – the use of [[history]] to validate and glorify modern ideals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REN/IDEA.HTM The Idea of the Renaissance]'', Richard Hooker, Washington State University Website (Retrieved on May 2) {{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The word ''Renaissance'', literally meaning "Rebirth" in French, first appeared in English in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites W Dyce and C H Wilson’s ''Letter to Lord Meadowbank'' (1837): "A style possessing many points of rude resemblance with the more elegant and refined character of the art of the renaissance in Italy." And the following year in ''Civil Engineer &amp; Architect’s Journal'': "Not that we consider the style of the Renaissance to be either pure or good per se." See Oxford English Dictionary, "Renaissance"&lt;/ref&gt; The word also occurs in [[Jules Michelet]]'s 1855 work, ''Histoire de France''. The word ''Renaissance'' has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] and the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].&lt;ref name=mur /&gt;

==Overview==
The Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the [[early modern period]]. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.&lt;ref name="perry-humanities"&gt;Perry, M. [http://college.hmco.com/humanities/perry/humanities/1e/students/summaries/ch13.html Humanities in the Western Tradition], Ch. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance humanist]]s such as [[Poggio Bracciolini]] sought out in Europe's monastic libraries the Latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]], while the [[Fall of Constantinople]] (1453) generated a wave of émigré Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in [[ancient Greek]], many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West. It is in their new focus on literary and historical texts that Renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], who had focused on studying [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic]] works of natural sciences, philosophy and mathematics, rather than on such cultural texts.

[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Idealized Portrait of a Lady (Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci as Nymph) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright||''[[Portrait of a Young Woman (Botticelli, Frankfurt)|Portrait of a Young Woman]]'' (c. 1480-85) ([[Simonetta Vespucci]]) by [[Sandro Botticelli]]]]

In the revival of [[neo-Platonism]] Renaissance humanists did not reject [[Christianity]]; quite the contrary, many of the Renaissance's greatest works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art. However, a subtle shift took place in the way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life.&lt;ref name="openuni"&gt;Open University, ''[http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/religion.htm Looking at the Renaissance: Religious Context in the Renaissance]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many Greek Christian works, including the Greek New Testament, were brought back from Byzantium to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars for the first time since late antiquity. This new engagement with Greek Christian works, and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]], would help pave the way for the [[Protestant Reformation]].

Well after the first artistic return to classicism had been exemplified in the sculpture of [[Nicola Pisano]], Florentine painters led by [[Masaccio]] strove to portray the human form realistically, developing techniques to render [[Linear perspective|perspective]] and light more naturally. [[Political philosophy|Political philosophers]], most famously [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally. A critical contribution to Italian Renaissance humanism [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] wrote the famous text ''"De hominis dignitate"'' ([[Oration on the Dignity of Man]], 1486), which consists of a series of theses on philosophy, natural thought, faith and magic defended against any opponent on the grounds of reason. In addition to studying classical Latin and Greek, Renaissance authors also began increasingly to use [[vernacular]] languages; combined with the introduction of [[Movable type|printing]], this would allow many more people access to books, especially the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Open University, [http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/economic.htm#urban ''Looking at the Renaissance: Urban economy and government''] (Retrieved May 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the [[secular]] and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought. Some scholars, such as [[Rodney Stark]],&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason'', Random House, NY: 2005&lt;/ref&gt; play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the [[Italian city-states]] in the [[High Middle Ages]], which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of [[capitalism]]. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.

==Origins==
{{main|Italian Renaissance}}
[[File:Sunset over florence 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|View of [[Florence]], birthplace of the Renaissance]]

Many argue that the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century [[Florence]], in particular with the writings of [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321) and [[Petrarch]] (1304–1374), as well as the paintings of [[Giotto di Bondone]] (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] and [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the [[Florence Cathedral]] (Ghiberti won).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Paul Robert, ''The Feud that sparked the Renaissance: How Brunelleschi and Ghiberti Changed the Art World'' (New York, Perennial-Harper Collins, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, [[Donatello]], and [[Masaccio]] for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance. Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.

During the Renaissance, money and art went hand in hand. Artists depended entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent. Wealth was brought to Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into Asia and Europe. Silver mining in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] increased the flow of money. Luxuries from the Eastern world, brought home during the [[Crusades]], increased the prosperity of Genoa and Venice.&lt;ref name="National Geographic Society"&gt;{{cite book | last = Severy | first = Merle |author2=Thomas B Allen |author3=Ross Bennett |author4=Jules B Billard |author5=Russell Bourne |author6=Edward Lanoutte |author7=David F Robinson |author8=Verla Lee Smith | title = The Renaissance – Maker of Modern Man| publisher = National Geographic Society| year = 1970| isbn = 978-0-87044-091-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jules Michelet]] defined the 16th-century Renaissance in France as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|title=The Renaissance Bazaar|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin and Greek phases of Renaissance humanism===
{{see also|Transmission of the Greek Classics}}
{{too few opinions|date=June 2015}}&lt;!--Needs some mention of Arabic scholars, such as Averroes' commentary of Aristotle and Plato; it is well known that Copernicus took ideas from uncited (not necessarily for POV reasons) Arabic scholars--&gt;
[[File:Salutati.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Coluccio Salutati]]]]

In stark contrast to the [[High Middle Ages]], when Latin scholars focused almost entirely on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;For information on this earlier, very different approach to a different set of ancient texts (scientific texts rather than cultural texts) see [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], and [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe]].&lt;/ref&gt; Renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as [[Petrarch]], [[Coluccio Salutati]] (1331–1406), [[Niccolò de' Niccoli]] (1364–1437) and [[Poggio Bracciolini]] (1380–1459) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as [[Cicero]], [[Lucretius]], [[Livy]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds and Wilson, pp. 113–123.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 15th century, the bulk of the surviving such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European scholars turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds and Wilson, pp. 123, 130–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike with Latin texts, which had been preserved and studied in Western Europe since late antiquity, the study of ancient Greek texts was very limited in medieval Western Europe. Ancient Greek works on science, maths and philosophy had been studied since the [[High Middle Ages]] in Western Europe and in the medieval Islamic world (normally in translation), but Greek literary, oratorical and historical works (such as Homer, the Greek dramatists, [[Demosthenes]] and [[Thucydides]]) were not studied in either the Latin or medieval Islamic worlds; in the Middle Ages these sorts of texts were only studied by Byzantine scholars. One of the greatest achievements of Renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of Greek cultural works back into Western Europe for the first time since late antiquity. Arab logicians had inherited Greek ideas after they had invaded and conquered [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Levant]]. Their translations and commentaries on these ideas worked their way through the Arab West into [[Al-Andalus|Iberia]] and [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]], which became important centers for this transmission of ideas. From the 11th to the 13th century, many schools dedicated to the translation of philosophical and scientific works from [[Classical Arabic]] to [[Medieval Latin]] were established in Iberia. Most notably the [[Toledo School of Translators]]. This work of translation from Islamic culture, though largely unplanned and disorganized, constituted one of the greatest transmissions of ideas in history.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kKGgoNo4un0C&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261 ''Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society''], Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret C. Jacob, James R. Jacob, 2008, 903 pages, p.261/262.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement to reintegrate the regular study of Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts back into the Western European curriculum is usually dated to the 1396 invitation from Coluccio Salutati to the Byzantine diplomat and scholar [[Manuel Chrysoloras]] (c.1355–1415) to teach Greek in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds and Wilson, pp. 119, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; This legacy was continued by a number of expatriate Greek scholars, from [[Basilios Bessarion]] to [[Leo Allatius]].

===Social and political structures in Italy===
[[File:Italy 1494 AD.png|thumb|A political map of the Italian [[Peninsula]] circa 1494]]

The unique political structures of late [[Middle Ages]] [[Italy]] have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a [[Nation-state|political entity]] in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller [[Italian city-states|city states]] and territories: the [[Kingdom of Naples]] controlled the south, the [[Republic of Florence]] and the [[Papal States]] at the center, the [[Milan]]ese and the [[Genoa|Genoese]] to the north and west respectively, and the [[Venice|Venetians]] to the east. Fifteenth-century Italy was one of the most [[urbanization|urbanised]] areas in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kirshner, Julius, ''Family and Marriage: A socio-legal perspective'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=x9grA0fWpDMC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=italy+urban+population+15th+century&amp;sig=7QjemnDKllytG-1qNFygZFmlUD0 ''Italy in the Age of the Renaissance: 1300–1550''], ed. John M. Najemy (Oxford University Press, 2004) p.89 (Retrieved on May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.&lt;ref&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob, ''The Revival of Antiquity', [http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/3-2.html ''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407181825/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/3-2.html |date=April 7, 2007 }}'' (trans. by S.G.C. Middlemore, 1878)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian and political philosopher [[Quentin Skinner]] points out that [[Otto of Freising]] (c. 1114–1158), a German bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form of political and social organization, observing that Italy appeared to have exited from Feudalism so that its society was based on merchants and commerce. Linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance fresco cycle ''Allegory of Good and Bad Government in Siena'' by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] (painted 1338–1340), whose strong message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration. Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as the [[Matteo Palmieri]] (1406–1475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but "the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same time".&lt;ref name="Skinner, Quentin p. 69"&gt;Skinner, Quentin, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought'', vol I: ''The Renaissance''; vol II: ''The Age of Reformation'', Cambridge University Press, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Even cities and states beyond central Italy, such as the [[Republic of Florence]] at this time, were also notable for their merchant [[Republics]], especially the [[Republic of Venice]]. Although in practice these were [[oligarchy|oligarchical]], and bore little resemblance to a modern [[democracy]], they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty.&lt;ref name="Skinner, Quentin p. 69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason'', New York, Random House, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, J. and Romano, D., ''Venice Reconsidered'', Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.&lt;ref name="burckhardt-republics"&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob, ''The Republics: Venice and Florence'', ''[http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/1-7.html The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407035616/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/1-7.html |date=April 7, 2007 }}'', translated by S.G.C. Middlemore, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. [[Merchants]] brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the [[Levant]]. Venice was Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine [[Venetian glass|glass]], while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.&lt;ref name="burckhardt-republics" /&gt;

===Black Plague===
One theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in [[Florence]] caused by the [[Black Death]], which hit [[Europe]] between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th-century Italy. Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on [[spirituality]] and the [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Tuchman]] (1978) ''A Distant Mirror'', Knopf {{ISBN|0-394-40026-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the [[Patron#Arts|sponsorship]] of religious works of art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/blackdeath.html The End of Europe's Middle Ages: The Black Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309162102/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/blackdeath.html |date=March 9, 2013 }} University of Calgary website. (Retrieved on April 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.&lt;ref name="brotton"&gt;Brotton, J., ''The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-280163-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of England, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.&lt;ref&gt;Netzley, Patricia D. ''Life During the Renaissance.''San Diego: Lucent Books, Inc., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30 to 40% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400.&lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, p. 217). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.

The spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty. [[Epidemic]]s ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;"Renaissance And Reformation France" Mack P. Holt pg.30,39,69,166&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Death caused greater upheaval to Florence's social and political structure than later epidemics. Despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to function during this period. Formal meetings of elected representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured continuity of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hatty|first=Suzanne|title=Disordered Body: Epidemic Disease and Cultural Transformation|work=ebscohost|location=State University of New York|page=89|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural conditions in Florence===
[[File:Lorenzo de' Medici Rubens.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lorenzo de' Medici]], ruler of [[Florence]] and patron of arts (Portrait by [[Rubens]])]]

It has long been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in [[Florence]], and not elsewhere in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the [[Medici]], a [[banking|banking family]] and later [[dynasty|ducal ruling house]], in patronizing and stimulating the arts. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]].&lt;ref name="strathern" /&gt; Works by [[Neri di Bicci]], Botticelli, da Vinci and [[Filippino Lippi]] had been commissioned additionally by the convent di San Donato agli Scopeti of the [[Augustinians]] order in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Carocci, I dintorni di Firenze, Vol. II, Galletti e Cocci, Firenze, 1907, pagg. 336-337&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance was certainly underway before Lorenzo de' Medici came to power – indeed, before the Medici family itself achieved hegemony in Florentine society. Some historians have postulated that Florence was the birthplace of the Renaissance as a result of luck, i.e. because "[[Great man theory|Great Men]]" were born there by chance:&lt;ref name="burckhardt-individual"&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob, ''The Development of the Individual'', ''[http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/2-1.html The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003000844/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/2-1.html |date=October 3, 2008 }}'', translated by S.G.C. Middlemore, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli and Michelangelo were all born in [[Tuscany]]. Arguing that such chance seems improbable, other historians have contended that these "Great Men" were only able to rise to prominence because of the prevailing cultural conditions at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, J., ''Individualism and the cult of creative personality'', ''The Italian Renaissance'', New York, 1990 p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Humanism===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}
[[File:Pico1.jpg|thumb|[[Pico della Mirandola]] wrote the famous ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'', which has been called the "Manifesto of the Renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;''Oration on the Dignity of Man'' (1486) [http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_1/pico.html wsu.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104024142/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_1/pico.html |date=January 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In some ways [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] was not a philosophy but a method of learning. In contrast to the medieval [[scholasticism|scholastic]] mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, humanists would study ancient texts in the original and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and [[empirical evidence]]. Humanist education was based on the programme of 'Studia Humanitatis', the study of five humanities: [[poetry]], [[grammar]], [[history]], [[moral philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]]. Although historians have sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely, most have settled on "a middle of the road definition... the movement to recover, interpret, and assimilate the language, literature, learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P., "The spread of Italian humanism", in ''The Impact of Humanism on Western Europe'', ed. A. Goodman and A. MacKay, London, 1990, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, humanists asserted "the genius of man&amp;nbsp;... the unique and extraordinary ability of the human mind".&lt;ref&gt;As asserted by Gianozzo Manetti in ''On the Dignity and Excellence of Man'', cited in Clare, J., ''Italian Renaissance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanist scholars shaped the intellectual landscape throughout the early modern period. Political philosophers such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Thomas More]] revived the ideas of Greek and Roman thinkers and applied them in critiques of contemporary government. [[Pico della Mirandola]] wrote the "manifesto" of the Renaissance, the ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'', a vibrant defence of thinking. [[Matteo Palmieri]] (1406–1475), another humanist, is most known for his work ''Della vita civile'' ("On Civic Life"; printed 1528), which advocated [[Classical republicanism|civic humanism]], and for his influence in refining the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan vernacular]] to the same level as Latin. Palmieri drew on Roman philosophers and theorists, especially [[Cicero]], who, like Palmieri, lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a theorist and philosopher and also [[Quintilian]]. Perhaps the most succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic work ''La città di vita'', but an earlier work, ''Della vita civile'' (On Civic Life), is more wide-ranging. Composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house in the Mugello countryside outside Florence during the plague of 1430, Palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen. The dialogues include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which is honest.

The humanists believed that it is important to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation.&lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, pp. 245–246). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology was referred to as the ''[[Polymath|uomo universale]]'', an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.

===Humanism and Libraries===
A unique characteristic of some Renaissance libraries is that they were open to the public. These libraries were places where ideas were exchanged and where scholarship and reading were considered both pleasurable and beneficial to the mind and soul. As freethinking was a hallmark of the age, many libraries contained a wide range of writers. Classical texts could be found alongside humanist writings. These informal associations of intellectuals profoundly influenced Renaissance culture. Some of the richest "bibliophiles" built libraries as temples to books and knowledge. A number of libraries appeared as manifestations of immense wealth joined with a love of books. In some cases, cultivated library builders were also committed to offering others the opportunity to use their collections. Prominent aristocrats and princes of the Church created great libraries for the use of their courts, called "court libraries", and were housed in lavishly designed monumental buildings decorated with ornate woodwork, and the walls adorned with frescoes (Murray, Stuart A.P.)

===Art===

{{see also|Islamic influences on Western art}}
[[File:Michelangelo's grave4.jpg|thumb|The tomb of [[Michelangelo]] in the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]]]]

Renaissance art marks a cultural rebirth at the close of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. [[Giotto|Giotto di Bondone]] (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.&lt;ref&gt;Clare, John D. &amp; Millen, Alan, ''Italian Renaissance'', London, 1994, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of perspective was part of a wider trend towards [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Stork, David G. ''[http://sirl.stanford.edu/~bob/teaching/pdf/arth202/Stork_SciAm04.pdf Optics and Realism in Renaissance Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614023308/http://sirl.stanford.edu/~bob/teaching/pdf/arth202/Stork_SciAm04.pdf |date=June 14, 2007 }}'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[human anatomy]]. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of [[aesthetics]], with the works of Leonardo, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]] representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Giorgio, ''Lives of the Artists'', translated by George Bull, Penguin Classics, 1965, {{ISBN|0-14-044164-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists include [[Sandro Botticelli]], working for the Medici in Florence, [[Donatello]], another Florentine, and [[Titian]] in Venice, among others.

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' (c. 1490) demonstrates the effect writers of Antiquity had on Renaissance thinkers. Based on the specifications in [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]'' (1st century BC), Leonardo tried to draw the perfectly proportioned man. (Museum [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], [[Venice]])]]

In the [[Netherlands]], a particularly vibrant artistic culture developed. The work of [[Hugo van der Goes]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] was particularly influential on the development of painting in Italy, both technically with the introduction of [[oil paint]] and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation (see ''[[Renaissance in the Netherlands]]''). Later, the work of [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/bio/b/bruegel/pieter_e/biograph.html Peter Brueghel Biography]'', Web Gallery of Art (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In architecture, [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] was foremost in studying the remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer [[Vitruvius]] and the flourishing discipline of [[mathematics]], Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building the dome of the [[Duomo of Florence|Florence Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, Richard, ''[http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/arts/Architec/RenaissanceArchitecture/ArchitectureandPublicSpace/ArchitectureandPublicSpace.htm Architecture and Public Space] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522160730/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/arts/Architec/RenaissanceArchitecture/ArchitectureandPublicSpace/ArchitectureandPublicSpace.htm |date=May 22, 2007 }}'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew in [[Mantua]], built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], combining the skills of [[Bramante]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Sangallo]] and [[Carlo Maderno|Maderno]].

During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and [[entablatures]] as an integrated system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of [[pilasters]]. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings|last=Saalman|first=Howard|publisher=Zwemmer|year=1993|isbn=978-0-271-01067-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arches, semi-circular or (in the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the [[Gothic style|Gothic]] vault, which is frequently rectangular.

Renaissance artists were not pagans, although they admired antiquity and kept some ideas and symbols of the medieval past. [[Nicola Pisano]] (c. 1220–c. 1278) imitated classical forms by portraying scenes from the Bible. His ''Annunciation'', from the [[Pisa Baptistry|Baptistry at Pisa]], demonstrates that classical models influenced Italian art before the Renaissance took root as a literary movement &lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, pp. 250–251). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
{{Main|History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance technology}}
[[File:Pacioli.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Portrait of Luca Pacioli]]'', father of accounting, painted by [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], 1495, ([[Museo di Capodimonte]]).]]

The rediscovery of ancient texts and the invention of [[printing]] democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely distributed ideas. In the first period of the [[Italian Renaissance]], humanists favoured the study of [[humanities]] over [[natural philosophy]] or [[applied mathematics]], and their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] views of the universe. Writing around 1450, [[Nicholas of Cusa|Nicholas Cusanus]] anticipated the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] worldview of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], but in a philosophical fashion.

Science and art were intermingled in the early Renaissance, with [[polymath]] artists such as Leonardo da Vinci making observational drawings of anatomy and nature. Da Vinci set up controlled experiments in water flow, medical dissection, and systematic study of movement and aerodynamics, and he devised principles of research method that led Fritjof Capra to classify him as the "father of modern science".&lt;ref&gt;Capra, Fritjof, ''The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Great Genius of the Renaissance'', New York, Doubleday, 2007. Exhaustive 2007 study by Fritjof Capra shows that Leonardo was a much greater scientist than previously thought, and not just an inventor. Leonardo was innovative in science theory and in conducting actual science practice. In Capra's detailed assessment of many surviving manuscripts, Leonardo's science in tune with holistic non-mechanistic and non-reductive approaches to science, which are becoming popular today.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of Da Vinci's contribution during this period include machines designed to saw marbles and lift monoliths and new discoveries in acoustics, botany, geology, anatomy and mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Columbus and Vesalius—The Age of Discoverers. ''JAMA.'' 2015;313(3):312. doi:10.1001/jama.2014.11534&lt;/ref&gt;

A suitable environment had developed to question scientific doctrine. The [[Age of Discovery|discovery]] in 1492 of the [[New World]] by [[Christopher Columbus]] challenged the classical worldview. The works of [[Ptolemy]] (in geography) and [[Galen]] (in medicine) were found to not always match everyday observations. As the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]] clashed, the [[Northern Renaissance]] showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Debus]], ''Man and Nature in the Renaissance'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements.

Some view this as a "[[scientific revolution]]", heralding the beginning of the modern age,&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, Herbert, ''The Origins of Modern Science, 1300–1800'', p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; others as an acceleration of a continuous process stretching from the ancient world to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, Steven. ''The Scientific Revolution'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Significant scientific advances were made during this time by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;"Scientific Revolution" in ''[[Encarta]]''. 2007. [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_701509067/Scientific_Revolution.html.]&lt;/ref&gt; Copernicus, in ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|De Revolutionibus]]'', posited that the Earth moved around the Sun. ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''On the Workings of the Human Body''), by [[Andreas Vesalius]], gave a new confidence to the role of [[dissection]], observation, and the [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanistic]] view of anatomy.&lt;ref name="short-science"&gt;Brotton, J., "Science and Philosophy", ''The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-280163-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important development was in the ''process'' for discovery, the [[scientific method]],&lt;ref name="short-science" /&gt; focusing on [[Empiricism|empirical evidence]] and the importance of [[mathematics]], while discarding Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included Copernicus, Galileo, and [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;

Applied innovation extended to commerce. At the end of the 15th century [[Luca Pacioli]] published the first work on [[bookkeeping]], making him the founder of [[accounting]].&lt;ref name=jkdiwan&gt;{{cite book |last=DIWAN |first=Jaswith|title=ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS &amp; THEORIES|publisher=MORRE|location=LONDON|id=id# 94452|pages=001–002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navigation and Geography===

During the Renaissance, extending from 1450 to 1650 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woodward |first1=David |title=The History of Cartography, Volume Three: Cartography in the European Renaissance |date=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago and London |isbn=9780226907338}}&lt;/ref&gt;, every Continent was visited and mostly mapped by Europeans, except the south polar continent now known as [[Antarctica]]. This development is depicted in the large world map ''Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula'' made by the Dutch cartographer [[Joan Blaeu]] in 1648 to commemorate the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. 

In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain seeking a direct route to Asia. He accidentally stumbled upon the Americas, but believed he had reached the East Indies.

In 1606, the Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the East Indies in the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] ship [[Duyfken]] and landed in [[Australia]]. He charted about 300 km of the west coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]] in Queensland. More than thirty Dutch expeditions followed, mapping sections of the north, west and south coasts. In 1642-1643, [[Abel Tasman]] circumnavigated the continent, proving that it was not joined to the imagined south polar continent.

By 1650, Dutch cartographers had mapped most of the coastline of the continent, which they named [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], except the east coast which was charted in 1770 by [[James Cook|Captain Cook]].

The long-imagined south polar continent was eventually sighted in 1820. Throughout the Renaissance it had been known as [[Terra Australis]], or 'Australia' for short. However, after that name was transferred to New Holland in the nineteenth century, the new name of 'Antarctica' was bestowed on the south polar continent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |page=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Renaissance music}}

From this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular the [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style of the [[Franco-Flemish]] school. The development of [[printing press|printing]] made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois class. Dissemination of [[chanson]]s, [[motet]]s, and [[mass (music)|masses]] throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Lassus]], [[Tomás Luis de Victoria|Victoria]] and [[William Byrd]].

===Religion===
{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Counter-Reformation}}
[[File:Alexander VI - Pinturicchio detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander VI]], a [[Borgia]] Pope infamous for his corruption]]

The new ideals of humanism, although more secular in some aspects, developed against a [[Christian]] backdrop, especially in the [[Northern Renaissance]]. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]].&lt;ref name="openuni" /&gt; However, the Renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary [[theology]], particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God.&lt;ref name="openuni" /&gt; Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including [[Erasmus]], [[Zwingli]], [[Thomas More]], [[Martin Luther]], and [[John Calvin]].

[[File:Clovio magi.jpg|thumb|''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' and ''[[Solomon]] adored by the [[Queen of Sheba]]'' from the ''[[Farnese Hours]]'' (1546) by [[Giulio Clovio]] marks [[Italian Renaissance#Renaissance end|the end of the Italian Renaissance]] of [[illuminated manuscript]] together with the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''.]]

The Renaissance began in times of religious turmoil. The late [[Middle Ages]] was a period of political intrigue surrounding the [[Papacy]], culminating in the [[Western Schism]], in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], ''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13539a.htm Western Schism]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; While the schism was resolved by the [[Council of Constance]] (1414), a resulting reform movement known as [[Conciliarism]] sought to limit the power of the pope. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] (1511), it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of [[Pope Alexander VI]], who was accused variously of [[simony]], [[nepotism]] and fathering four children (most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power) while a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], ''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01289a.htm Alexander VI]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther proposed reform to the Church, often based on humanist [[textual criticism]] of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name="openuni" /&gt; In October 1517 Luther published the [[95 Theses]], challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, particularly with regard to instances of sold [[indulgences]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;It is sometimes thought that the Church, as an institution, formally sold indulgences at the time. This, however, was not the practice. Donations were often received, but only mandated by individuals that were condemned. (See [[Indulgence]].)&lt;/ref&gt; The 95 Theses led to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in [[Western Europe]]. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.

[[Pope Paul III]] came to the papal throne (1534–1549) after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]], with uncertainties prevalent in the Catholic Church following the Protestant Reformation. Nicolaus Copernicus dedicated ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) to Paul III, who became the grandfather of [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)]], who had paintings by [[Titian]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael]], as well as an important collection of drawings, and who commissioned the masterpiece of [[Giulio Clovio]], arguably the last major [[illuminated manuscript]], the ''[[Farnese Hours]]''.

===Self-awareness===
[[File:Leonardo Bruni - Imagines philologorum.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Leonardo Bruni]]]]
By the 15th century, writers, artists, and architects in Italy were well aware of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as ''modi antichi'' (in the antique manner) or ''alle romana et alla antica'' (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to describe their work. In the 1330s [[Petrarch]] referred to pre-Christian times as ''antiqua'' (ancient) and to the Christian period as ''nova'' (new).&lt;ref name=mommsen&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mommsen | first = Theodore E.|authorlink =Theodor Ernst Mommsen |title = Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages' | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–242 | year = 1942| doi = 10.2307/2856364|jstor = 2856364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt;
[[Leonardo Bruni]] was the first to use tripartite [[periodization]] in his ''History of the Florentine People'' (1442).&lt;ref name="Hankins"&gt;Leonardo Bruni, James Hankins, ''History of the Florentine people'', Volume 1, Books 1–4 (2001), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. [[Flavio Biondo]] used a similar framework in ''Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire'' (1439–1453).

Humanist historians argued that contemporary scholarship restored direct links to the classical period, thus bypassing the Medieval period, which they then named for the first time the "[[Middle Ages]]". The term first appears in Latin in 1469 as ''media tempestas'' (middle times).&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin, ''The Global Age: state and society beyond modernity'' (1997), Stanford University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwmdxMMjOd4C&amp;pg=PA205 p. 205] {{ISBN|0-8047-2870-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''la rinascita'' (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Le Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, e architettori|Lives of the Artists]]'', 1550, revised 1568.&lt;ref name="panofsky"&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky, Erwin]]. ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', New York: Harper and Row, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Open University Guide to the Renaissance, ''[http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance/defining.htm Defining the Renaissance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721070445/http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance/defining.htm |date=July 21, 2009 }}'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari divides the age into three phases: the first phase contains [[Cimabue]], [[Giotto]], and [[Arnolfo di Cambio]]; the second phase contains [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], and [[Donatello]]; the third centers on [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and culminates with [[Michelangelo]]. It was not just the growing awareness of classical antiquity that drove this development, according to Vasari, but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sohm, Philip. ''Style in the Art Theory of Early Modern Italy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-521-78069-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread==
In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly from its birthplace in Florence to the rest of Italy and soon to the rest of Europe. The invention of the [[printing press]] by German printer [[Johannes Gutenberg]] allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. As it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.

===England===
{{main|English Renaissance}}

how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension
how like a god!" — from [[William Shakespeare]]'s'' [[Hamlet]]''.]]

In England, the sixteenth century marked the beginning of the [[English Renaissance]] with the work of writers [[William Shakespeare]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Sir Thomas More]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Sir Philip Sidney]], as well as great artists, architects (such as [[Inigo Jones]] who introduced Italianate architecture to England), and composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]], [[John Taverner]], and [[William Byrd]].

===France===
{{main|French Renaissance}}

[[File:Chateau de chambord.jpg|thumb|left|[[Château de Chambord]] (1519–1547), one of the most famous examples of [[Renaissance architecture]]]]

The word "Renaissance" is borrowed from the French language, where it means "re-birth". It was first used in the eighteenth century and was later popularized by French [[historian]] [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874) in his 1855 work, ''Histoire de France'' (History of France).&lt;ref name="Michelet, Jules 1847"&gt;Michelet, Jules.

In 1495 the [[Italian Renaissance]] arrived in France, imported by King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted the spread of secularism was the inability of the Church to offer assistance against the [[Black Death]]. [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] imported Italian art and artists, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as [[François Rabelais]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]], [[Joachim du Bellay]] and [[Michel de Montaigne]], painters such as [[Jean Clouet]], and musicians such as [[Jean Mouton]] also borrowed from the spirit of the Renaissance.

In 1533, a fourteen-year-old [[Catherine de' Medici|Caterina de' Medici]] (1519–1589), born in Florence to Lorenzo II de' Medici and Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne, married [[Henry II of France]], second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude. Though she became famous and infamous for her role in France's religious wars, she made a direct contribution in bringing arts, sciences and music (including the origins of [[ballet]]) to the French court from her native Florence.

===Germany===
{{main|German Renaissance}}
[[File:Jan van Eyck 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'', by [[Jan van Eyck]], 1434]]

In the second half of the 15th century, the Renaissance spirit spread to [[Germany]] and the [[Low Countries]], where the development of the printing press (ca. 1450) and early Renaissance artists such as the painters [[Jan van Eyck]] (1395–1441) and [[Hieronymus Bosch]] (1450–1516) and the composers [[Johannes Ockeghem]] (1410–1497), [[Jacob Obrecht]] (1457–1505) and [[Josquin des Prez]] (1455–1521) predated the influence from Italy. In the early Protestant areas of the country [[humanism]] became closely linked to the turmoil of the Protestant Reformation, and the art and writing of the [[German Renaissance]] frequently reflected this dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=560776|year=1965|title=The Religious Renaissance of the German Humanists |author=Strauss, Gerald|journal=English Historical Review|volume=80|issue=314|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the gothic style and medieval scholastic philosophy remained exclusively until the turn of the 16th century. Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] of [[Habsburg]] (ruling 1493–1519) was the first truly Renaissance monarch of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

===Hungary===
After Italy, Hungary was the first European country where the Renaissance appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Waldman }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance style came directly from Italy during the [[Quattrocento]] to Hungary first in the Central European region, thanks to the development of early Hungarian-Italian relationships – not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations – growing in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason – exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegrád, Tata and Várpalota. In Sigismund's court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Title: Hungary (4th edition)Authors: Zoltán Halász / András Balla (photo) / Zsuzsa Béres (translation) Published by Corvina, in 1998 {{ISBN|963-13-4129-1}}, 963-13-4727-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Italian trend combined with existing national traditions to create a particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to the [[Florence|Florentine]] humanist center, so a direct connection with [[Florence]] evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to [[Buda]], helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them [[Vitéz János]], archbishop of [[Esztergom]], one of the founders of Hungarian humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazione-delbianco.org/inglese/relaz00_01/mester.htm |title=the influences of the florentine renaissance in hungary |publisher=Fondazione-delbianco.org |accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the long reign of emperor [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]] the [[Buda Castle|Royal Castle of Buda]] became probably the largest [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] palace of the late [[Middle Ages]]. King [[Matthias Corvinus]] (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.&lt;ref&gt;History section: Miklós Horler: Budapest műemlékei I, Bp: 1955, pp. 259–307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Post-war reconstruction: László Gerő: A helyreállított budai vár, Bp, 1980, pp. 11–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the marriage in 1476 of King Matthias to [[Beatrice of Naples]], [[Buda]] became one of the most important artistic centres of the Renaissance north of the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name="czigany"&gt;Czigány, Lóránt, ''A History of Hungarian Literature'', "[http://mek.oszk.hu/02000/02042/html/5.html The Renaissance in Hungary]" (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important humanists living in Matthias' court were [[Antonio Bonfini]] and the famous Hungarian poet [[Janus Pannonius]].&lt;ref name="czigany" /&gt; [[András Hess]] set up a printing press in Buda in 1472. Matthias Corvinus's library, the ''[[Bibliotheca Corviniana]]'', was Europe's greatest collections of secular books: historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century. His library was second only in size to the Vatican Library. (However, the Vatican Library mainly contained Bibles and religious materials.)&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Tanner, The Raven King: Matthias Corvinus and the Fate of his Lost Library (New Haven: Yale U.P., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1489, Bartolomeo della Fonte of Florence wrote that Lorenzo de' Medici founded his own Greek-Latin library encouraged by the example of the Hungarian king. Corvinus's library is part of UNESCO World Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051105150132/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D15976%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html Documentary heritage concerning Hungary and recommended for inclusion in the Memory of the World International Register]. portal.unesco.org&lt;/ref&gt;
Other important figures of Hungarian Renaissance include [[Bálint Balassi]] (poet), [[Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos]] (poet), [[Bálint Bakfark]] (composer and lutenist), and [[Master MS]] (fresco painter).

===Netherlands===

Culture in the Netherlands at the end of the 15th century was influenced by the Italian Renaissance through trade via [[Bruges]], which made Flanders wealthy. Its nobles commissioned artists who became known across Europe.&lt;ref name="Heughebaert"&gt;{{cite book | last=Heughebaert | first=H. |author2=Defoort, A. |author3=Van Der Donck, R. | year=1998 | title=Artistieke opvoeding | publisher=Den Gulden Engel bvba. | location=Wommelgem, Belgium | isbn=978-90-5035-222-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In science, the [[Anatomy|anatomist]] [[Andreas Vesalius]] led the way; in [[cartography]], [[Gerardus Mercator]]'s map assisted explorers and navigators.

[[File:Thetriumphofdeath.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'' (c. 1562) reflects the social upheaval and terror that followed the plague that devastated medieval Europe.]]

The Renaissance in Northern Europe has been termed the "Northern Renaissance". While Renaissance ideas were moving north from Italy, there was a simultaneous southward spread of some areas of innovation, particularly in [[Renaissance music|music]].&lt;ref name="musical-quarterly"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Láng, Paul Henry|jstor=738699|title=The So Called Netherlands Schools|journal=The Musical Quarterly|volume=25|issue= 1|year=1939|pages=48–59|doi=10.1093/mq/xxv.1.48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music of the 15th-century [[Burgundian School]] defined the beginning of the Renaissance in music, and the [[polyphony]] of the [[Franco-Flemish School|Netherlanders]], as it moved with the musicians themselves into Italy, formed the core of the first true international style in [[music]] since the standardization of [[Gregorian Chant]] in the 9th century.&lt;ref name="musical-quarterly" /&gt; The culmination of the Netherlandish school was in the music of the Italian [[composer]] [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]]. At the end of the 16th century Italy again became a center of musical innovation, with the development of the polychoral style of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], which spread northward into Germany around 1600.

The paintings of the Italian Renaissance differed from those of the Northern Renaissance. [[Italian Renaissance]] artists were among the first to paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Later, the works of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that [[Flemish Primitives|Flemish]] brothers [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] perfected the [[oil painting]] technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/optg/hd_optg.htm Painting in Oil in the Low Countries and Its Spread to Southern Europe]'', [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] website. (Retrieved April 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the decisive influence of [[Dante Alighieri]] on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Celenza, Christopher (2004), ''The Lost Italian Renaissance: Humanists, Historians, and Latin's Legacy''. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the printing press technology boosted the Renaissance in Northern Europe as elsewhere, with Venice becoming a world center of printing.

An early Italian humanist who came to [[Poland]] in the mid-15th century was [[Filippo Buonaccorsi]]. Many Italian artists came to Poland with [[Bona Sforza]] of Milan, when she married King [[Sigismund I the Old]] in 1518.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.poland.gov.pl/Bona,Sforza,%281494,%E2%80%93,1557%29,1958.html Bona Sforza (1494–1557)]. poland.gov.pl (Retrieved April 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, as well as by newly established universities.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [http://www.uj.edu.pl/dispatch.jsp?item=uniwersytet/historia/historiatxt.jsp&amp;lang=en#narodziny re-establishment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021120144715/http://www.uj.edu.pl/dispatch.jsp?item=uniwersytet%2Fhistoria%2Fhistoriatxt.jsp&amp;lang=en |date=November 20, 2002 }} of [[Jagiellonian University]] in 1364.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the [[Polish Golden Age|Golden Age]] of [[Polish culture]]. Ruled by the [[Jagiellon dynasty]], the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] (from 1569 known as the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major wars – aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the [[Polish Brethren]]), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (''[[szlachta]]'') who gained dominance in the new political system of [[Golden Liberty]]. The Polish Renaissance architecture has three periods of development.

The greatest monument of this style in the territory of the former [[Duchy of Pomerania]] is the [[Ducal Castle, Szczecin|Ducal Castle]] in [[Szczecin]].

===Portugal===

Renaissance arrived through the influence of wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of [[Age of Discovery|European exploration]], [[Lisbon]] flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including [[Pedro Nunes]], [[João de Castro]], [[Abraham Zacuto]] and [[Martin Behaim]]. Cartographers [[Pedro Reinel]], [[Lopo Homem]], [[Estêvão Gomes]] and [[Diogo Ribeiro]] made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary [[Tomé Pires]] and physicians [[Garcia de Orta]] and [[Cristóvão da Costa]] collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist [[Carolus Clusius]].

===Russia===
Renaissance trends from Italy and Central Europe influenced Russia in many ways. Their influence was rather limited, however, due to the large distances between Russia and the main European cultural centers and the strong adherence of Russians to their [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox traditions]] and [[Third Rome|Byzantine legacy]].

Prince [[Ivan III]] introduced [[Renaissance architecture]] to [[Russia]] by inviting a number of architects from [[Italy]], who brought new construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of [[Russian architecture]]. In 1475 the Bolognese architect [[Aristotele Fioravanti]] came to rebuild the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], which had been damaged in an earthquake. Fioravanti was given the 12th-century [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Vladimir Cathedral]] as a model, and he produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.

[[File:Palais à facettes.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Facets]] on the [[Cathedral Square, Moscow|Cathedral Square]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]]]]

In 1485 Ivan III commissioned the building of the royal residence, [[Terem Palace]], within the Kremlin, with [[Aloisio da Milano]] as the architect of the first three floors. He and other Italian architects also contributed to the construction of the Kremlin walls and towers. The small banquet hall of the [[Russian Tsar]]s, called the [[Palace of Facets]] because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, [[Marco Ruffo]] and [[Pietro Solario]], and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as [[Aleviz Novyi]] or Aleviz Fryazin arrived in Moscow. He may have been the Venetian sculptor, Alevisio Lamberti da Montagne. He built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]], a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style. It is believed that the Cathedral of the [[Metropolitan Peter]] in [[Vysokopetrovsky Monastery]], another work of Aleviz Novyi, later served as an inspiration for the so-called ''octagon-on-tetragon'' architectural form in the [[Moscow Baroque]] of the late 17th century.

Between the early 16th and the late 17th centuries, an original tradition of stone [[tented roof]] architecture developed in Russia. It was quite unique and different from the contemporary Renaissance architecture elsewhere in Europe, though some research terms the style 'Russian Gothic' and compares it with the European [[Gothic architecture]] of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced the invention of the stone tented roof (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called [[Petrok Maly]] may have been an author of the Ascension Church in [[Kolomenskoye]], one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm The first stone tented roof church and the origins of the tented roof architecture] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at RusArch.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century the influence of [[Renaissance painting]] resulted in [[Russian icons]] becoming slightly more realistic, while still following most of the old icon painting [[Aesthetic canon|canon]]s, as seen in the works of [[Bogdan Saltanov]], [[Simon Ushakov]], [[Gury Nikitin]], [[Karp Zolotaryov]] and other [[Russian artists]] of the era. Gradually the new type of secular portrait painting appeared, called ''parsúna'' (from "persona" – person), which was transitional style between abstract iconographics and real paintings.

In the mid 16th-century Russians adopted [[printing]] from Central Europe, with [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] being the first known Russian printer. In the 17th century printing became widespread, and [[woodcut]]s became especially popular. That led to the development of a special form of [[folk art]] known as [[lubok]] printing, which persisted in Russia well into the 19th century.

A number of technologies from the European Renaissance period were adopted by Russia rather early and subsequently perfected to become a part of a strong domestic tradition. Mostly these were military technologies, such as [[cannon]] [[casting]] adopted by at least the 15th century. The [[Tsar Cannon]], which is the [[List of largest cannon by caliber|world's largest bombard by caliber]], is a masterpiece of Russian cannon making. It was cast in 1586 by [[Andrey Chokhov]] and is notable for its rich, decorative [[relief]]. Another technology, that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from Europe by the [[Italians]], resulted in the development of [[vodka]], the national beverage of Russia. As early as 1386 [[Genoa|Genoese]] ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ("water of life") to [[Moscow]] and presented it to [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Duke]] [[Dmitry Donskoy]]. The Genoese likely developed this beverage with the help of the [[alchemist]]s of [[Provence]], who used an [[Arab]]-invented [[distillation apparatus]] to convert [[grape]] [[must]] into [[alcohol]]. A Moscovite monk called [[Isidore (inventor)|Isidore]] used this technology to produce the first original [[Russian vodka]] c. 1430.&lt;ref name="pohlebkin_history"&gt;{{cite book

The Renaissance arrived in the Iberian peninsula through the Mediterranean possessions of the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese Crown]] and the city of [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]]. Many early Spanish Renaissance writers come from the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], including [[Ausiàs March]] and [[Joanot Martorell]]. In the [[Kingdom of Castile]], the early Renaissance was heavily influenced by the Italian humanism, starting with writers and poets such as [[Íñigo López de Mendoza, marqués de Santillana|the Marquis of Santillana]], who introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain in the early 15th century. Other writers, such as [[Jorge Manrique]], [[Fernando de Rojas]], [[Juan del Encina]], [[Juan Boscán Almogáver]] and [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]], kept a close resemblance to the Italian canon. [[Miguel de Cervantes]]'s [[masterpiece]] [[Don Quixote]] is credited as the first Western novel. Renaissance humanism flourished in the early 16th century, with influential writers such as philosopher [[Juan Luis Vives]], grammarian [[Antonio de Nebrija]] and natural historian [[Pedro Mexía|Pedro de Mexía]].

Later Spanish Renaissance tended towards religious themes and mysticism, with poets such as [[Luis Ponce de León|fray Luis de León]], [[Teresa of Ávila]] and [[John of the Cross]], and treated issues related to the exploration of the [[New World]], with chroniclers and writers such as [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]] and [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], giving rise to a body of work, now known as [[Spanish Renaissance literature]]. The late Renaissance in Spain produced artists such as [[El Greco]] and composers such as [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]] and [[Antonio de Cabezón]].

==Historiography==

===Conception===
[[File:Vite.jpg|thumb|A cover of the ''Lives of the Artists'' by [[Giorgio Vasari]] ]]

The Italian [[artist]] and [[critic]] [[Giorgio Vasari]] (1511–1574) first used the term ''rinascita'' retrospectively in his book ''[[The Lives of the Artists]]'' (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define what he described as a break with the barbarities of [[gothic art]]: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay with the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]] and only the [[Tuscana|Tuscan]] artists, beginning with [[Cimabue]] (1240–1301) and [[Giotto]] (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw antique art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/defining.htm |title=Defining the Renaissance, Open University |publisher=Open.ac.uk |accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, only in the 19th century did the [[French language|French]] word ''Renaissance'' achieve popularity in describing the self-conscious cultural movement based on revival of Roman models that began in the late-13th century. French [[historian]] [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874) defined "The Renaissance" in his 1855 work ''Histoire de France'' as an entire historical period, whereas previously it had been used in a more limited sense.&lt;ref name=mur&gt;Murray, P. and Murray, L. (1963) ''The Art of the Renaissance''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] (World of Art), p. 9. {{ISBN|978-0-500-20008-7}}.  "...in 1855 we find, for the first time, the word 'Renaissance' used — by the French historian Michelet — as an adjective to describe a whole period of history and not confined to the rebirth of Latin letters or a classically inspired style in the arts."&lt;/ref&gt; For Michelet, the Renaissance was more a development in science than in art and culture. He asserted that it spanned the period from [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Copernicus to [[Galileo]]; that is, from the end of the 15th century to the middle of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Michelet, Jules 1847"/&gt; Moreover, Michelet distinguished between what he called, "the bizarre and monstrous" quality of the Middle Ages and the [[democracy|democratic]] values that he, as a vocal [[Republicanism|Republican]], chose to see in its character.&lt;ref name="brotton" /&gt; A French nationalist, Michelet also sought to claim the Renaissance as a French movement.&lt;ref name="brotton" /&gt;

The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897) in his ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'' (1860), by contrast, defined the Renaissance as the period between Giotto and [[Michelangelo]] in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance the emergence of the modern spirit of [[individualism|individuality]], which the [[Middle Ages]] had stifled.&lt;ref&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob. ''[http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/burckhardt.html The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921145058/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/burckhardt.html |date=September 21, 2008 }}'' (trans. S.G.C Middlemore, London, 1878)&lt;/ref&gt; His book was widely read and became influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter, ''Style in History'', New York: Basic Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Buckhardt has been accused{{by whom|date=November 2013}} of setting forth a linear [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of history in seeing the Renaissance as the origin of the modern world.&lt;ref name="starn"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Starn, Randolph|jstor=2650779|title= Renaissance Redux|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=103|issue=1 |year=1998|pages=122–124|doi=10.2307/2650779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, some historians have been much less keen to define the Renaissance as a historical age, or even as a coherent cultural movement. The historian Randolph Starn, of the [[University of California Berkeley]], stated in 1998:

{{quote|"Rather than a period with definitive beginnings and endings and consistent content in between, the Renaissance can be (and occasionally has been) seen as a movement of practices and ideas to which specific groups and identifiable persons variously responded in different times and places. It would be in this sense a network of diverse, sometimes converging, sometimes conflicting cultures, not a single, time-bound culture".&lt;ref name="starn" /&gt;
}}

===Debates about progress===
{{see also|Continuity thesis}}
[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|thumb|Painting of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], an event in the [[French Wars of Religion]], by [[François Dubois]]]]
There is debate about the extent to which the Renaissance improved on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance towards the [[modern age]]. Burckhardt likened the change to a veil being removed from man's eyes, allowing him to see clearly.&lt;ref name="burckhardt-individual" /&gt;

{{quote|In the Middle Ages both sides of human consciousness – that which was turned within as that which was turned without – lay dreaming or half awake beneath a common veil. The veil was woven of faith, illusion, and childish prepossession, through which the world and history were seen clad in strange hues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Burckhardt |first=Jacob |authorlink=Jacob Burckhardt |url=http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/2-1.html |title=The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy |accessdate=August 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003000844/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/2-1.html |archivedate=October 3, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;|Jacob Burckhardt|''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy}}

On the other hand, many historians now point out that most of the negative social factors popularly associated with the medieval period – poverty, warfare, religious and political persecution, for example – seem to have worsened in this era, which saw the rise of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavellian politics]], the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], the corrupt [[Borgia]] Popes, and the intensified [[witch-hunt]]s of the 16th century. Many people who lived during the Renaissance did not view it as the "[[golden age]]" imagined by certain 19th-century authors, but were concerned by these social maladies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Savonarola]]'s popularity is a prime example of the manifestation of such concerns. Other examples include [[Philip II of Spain]]'s censorship of Florentine paintings, noted by Edward L. Goldberg, "Spanish Values and Tuscan Painting", ''Renaissance Quarterly'' (1998) p.914&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, though, the artists, writers, and patrons involved in the cultural movements in question believed they were living in a new era that was a clean break from the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="panofsky" /&gt; Some [[Historical materialism|Marxist historians]] prefer to describe the Renaissance in material terms, holding the view that the changes in art, literature, and philosophy were part of a general economic trend from [[feudalism]] towards [[capitalism]], resulting in a [[bourgeois]] class with leisure time to devote to the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hull.ac.uk/renforum/v2no2/siar.htm Renaissance Forum] at [[Hull University]], Autumn 1997 (Retrieved on May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johan Huizinga]] (1872–1945) acknowledged the existence of the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]'', he argued that the Renaissance was a period of decline from the [[High Middle Ages]], destroying much that was important.&lt;ref name="huizinga" /&gt; The [[Latin|Latin language]], for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep [[economic recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lopez, Robert S. |author2=Miskimin, Harry A. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Economic Depression of the Renaissance|journal=Economic History Review|jstor=2591885|volume= 14 |year=1962|pages=408–26|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1962.tb00059.x|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[George Sarton]] and [[Lynn Thorndike]] have both argued that [[Science|scientific]] progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Lynn Thorndike|author=Thorndike, Lynn|year=1943|title=Some Remarks on the Question of the Originality of the Renaissance|pages=49–74|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|jstor=2707236|volume= 4|issue=1|doi=10.2307/2707236|last2=Johnson|first2=F. R.|last3=Kristeller|first3=P. O.|last4=Lockwood|first4=D. P.|last5=Thorndike|first5=L.|bibcode=1961JHI....22..215C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Joan Kelly]] argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly-Gadol, Joan. "Did Women Have a Renaissance?" ''Becoming Visible: Women in European History.'' Edited by Renate Bridenthal and Claudia Koonz. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians have begun to consider the word ''Renaissance'' to be unnecessarily loaded, implying an unambiguously positive rebirth from the supposedly more primitive "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", the [[Middle Ages]]. Most historians now prefer to use the term "[[Early Modern Europe|early modern]]" for this period, a more neutral designation that highlights the period as a transitional one between the Middle Ages and the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt]] ''Renaissance Self-Fashioning: From More to Shakespeare'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Roger Osborne have come to consider the Italian Renaissance as a repository of the myths and ideals of western history in general, and instead of rebirth of ancient ideas as a period of great innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Osborne, Roger |title=Civilization: a new history of the Western world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFZ3M8N73b0C&amp;pg=PA180|accessdate=December 10, 2011|date=November 1, 2006|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-933648-19-4|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Renaissances==
The term ''Renaissance'' has also been used to define periods outside of the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Charles H. Haskins]] (1870–1937), for example, made a case for a [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Haskins, Charles Homer, ''The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1927 {{ISBN|0-674-76075-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians have argued for a [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 8th and 9th centuries, and still later for an [[Ottonian Renaissance]] in the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, Jean, ''L'Empire carolingien'' (English: ''The Carolingian Renaissance'', translated by James Emmons, New York: G. Braziller, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Other periods of cultural rebirth have also been termed "renaissances", such as the [[Bengal Renaissance]], [[Tamil Renaissance]], [[Nepal Bhasa renaissance]], [[al-Nahda]] or the [[Harlem Renaissance]].

'''Rural TV''' was a [[rural]] lifestyle and culture [[television]] channel. It was launched on March 2, 2009, replacing '''Pulse +45mins'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruraltv.tv/about.php ''Rural TV: About us'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural TV, known as "The World's Rural Channel", was considered to have been the world’s first 24-hour international multi-media channel dedicated to serving the needs, and interests, of country people, and those with a passion for rural affairs.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Programmes are aimed at enthusiasts for equine, rural lifestyle, and farming, along with traditional country music and entertainment.

The Rural TV website offered video-on-demand and streaming video of the channels content through its "Country Club" membership subscription. In addition, a Rural TV Newsletter, "The Rural Good Times Dispatch" is published bi-weekly.

Rural TV was the international sister channel of [[RFD-TV]]. The two channels broadcast a certain amount of each other's programmes. Rural TV International and Rural Media Group, which has distributed TV programming internationally (Which began in 2005), began distributing Rural media content globally. Sales and distribution of the content was handled by London and Nashville offices.

In June 2010, Rural TV ceased as a separate channel, with its programming moved to [[Horse &amp; Country TV]] as a series of programming blocks, airing there 7 days a week. In January 2011, Rural TV went to a 24/7 online broadcast. Rural TV was available through an RFD-TV/Rural TV Country Club Membership. The Country Club could be accessed on both the Rural TV and RFD-TV web sites. Rural TV was available on Dish Network Channel 232, which began in February 2012. FamilyNet replaced Rural TV on that Channel space when those two networks merged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2012/11/familynet-merges-with-rural-tv-on.html FamilyNet merges with Rural TV]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2012, Rural TV purchased FamilyNet &amp; was then announced that FamilyNet would take over the channel space of Rural TV, and did so when the two channels merged on January 1, 2013. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melodika.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=442766&amp;Itemid=54|title=Rural Media Group Purchases FamilyNet|work=Melodika|date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russel Blaine Nye''' (February 17, 1913 – September 2, 1993&lt;ref name=SSDI&gt;{{cite web|title=Russel B Nye|url=http://www.americanancestors.org/PageDetail.aspx?recordId=84333408|work=Social Security Death Index|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] professor of English who in the 1960s pioneered [[popular culture studies|Popular Culture Theory]].  He is the author of a dozen books.  His book ''George Bancroft: Brahmin Rebel'' won the 1945 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]].

Born in [[Viola, Wisconsin]], Nye received his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Oberlin College]] in 1934 and his master's degree from the [[University of Wisconsin]] in English the following year. In 1938 he married Kathryn Chaney, and in 1940 he completed his doctorate on [[George Bancroft]] again at the [[University of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;"Russel B(laine) Nye - 1913-1993" ''Contemporary Authors'' Gale&lt;/ref&gt; Nye taught in the English department at [[Michigan State University]] from 1941 to 1979.

In 1957 after the director of the [[Detroit Public Library]] claimed that [[Frank L. Baum]]'s novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'' had no value and shouldn't be stocked by libraries, Nye and [[Martin Gardner]] published a new critical edition of the novel bringing out its value, causing a firestorm of controversy, followed by eventual acceptance.

In 1970 he co-founded the [[Popular Culture Association]] with [[Ray B. Browne]] and [[Marshall Fishwick]], working to shape a new academic discipline called [[popular culture studies|Popular Culture Theory]] that blurred the traditional distinctions between high and low culture, focusing on mass culture mediums like television and the Internet, and cultural archetypes like [[comic book]] heroes.

He died in [[Lansing, Michigan]] in 1993.

One early founder of the STEAM initiative is [[Georgette Yakman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501083822/http://stanleybeamansears.com/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-steam-education/|title=Stanley Beaman &amp; Sears » 5 Things You Need to Know About STEAM Education|date=2013-05-01|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in addition to raising the idea of adding the arts to the STEM acronym, claims to have found a formal way to link the subjects together and correspond them to the global socioeconomic world: "Science and Technology, interpreted through Engineering and the Arts, all based in elements of Mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yakman|first=Georgette|title=STEAM Education: an overview of creating a model of integrative education|url=https://www.academia.edu/8113795/STEAM_Education_an_overview_of_creating_a_model_of_integrative_education|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She provides professional development training to individual educators and programs on how to use the STEAM framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://steamedu.com/programs/|title=https://steamedu.com/programs/|website=steamedu.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Senator Mark Warner announced Yakman's nomination as NCTC’s STEAM Teacher of the Year 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://steamedu.com/|website=STEAM Education|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgette Yakman|url=https://steamedu.academia.edu/GeorgetteYakman|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*A [[joint resolution]] was introduced  in the [[United States House of Representatives]] expressing the sense that adding art and design into Federal programs that target the STEM fields encourages innovation and economic growth in the United States.&lt;ref name="113HR51"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hres51ih/pdf/BILLS-113hres51ih.pdf|title=H.

*''Sesame Street''{{'}}s 43rd season continues to focus on STEM, but finds ways to integrate arts. They state: "This helps make learning STEM concepts relevant and enticing to young children by highlighting how artists use STEM knowledge to enhance their art or solve problems. It also provides context for the importance of STEM knowledge in careers in the arts (e.g. musician, painter, sculptor and dancer)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/stem-to-steam-strengthens-economy-john-maeda|title=STEM to STEAM: Art in K-12 Is Key to Building a Strong Economy|last1=Maeda|first1=John|date=|website=Edutopia|publisher=Edutopia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sesame Workshop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/season43/about-the-show/curriculum/|title=STEM + A = STEAM: When art meets science, technology, engineering and math|last=|first=|date=|website=Sesameworkshop.org|publisher=Sesame Workshop|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Rhode Island School of Design]] has a STEM to STEAM program and maintains an interactive map that shows global STEAM initiatives. Relevant organizations are able to add themselves to the map. [[John Maeda]], (2008 to 2013 president of Rhode Island School of Design) has been a leader in bringing the initiative to the political forums of educational policy.
* Wolf Trap's Institute of Education, as part of a $1.5 million Department of Education grant, trains and places teaching artists into preschool and kindergarten classrooms.

== Other uses of the STEAM Acronym ==
American [[Lisa La Bonte]], CEO of the [[Arab Youth Venture Foundation]] based in the [[United Arab Emirates]], uses the STEAM acronym however her work does not include arts integration. In 2007, she created high profile public STEAM programs in 2007 having added an A for 'inspired STEM', with the A standing for Aeronautics,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Aviation,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Astronomy,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Aerospace,&lt;ref name="BTC_LaBonte_E"&gt;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/migrate/uploads/BTC_LaBonte_E.pdf|title=Microsoft Word - Lisa LaBonte Final to Ann|year=2010|author=Lisa LaBonte|accessdate=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ad Astra!{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} and using all things "air and space"{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} as a hook for youth to embark on greater experimentation, studies, and careers in the region's burgeoning space related industries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1746">'''The Scandinavian Society for Iranian Studies''' ({{lang-fa|انجمنِ ایران‌شناسیِ اسکاندیناوی}}) is a [[Scandinavia]]n association of scholars working in the field of [[Iranian Studies]] with members not only from Scandinavian countries, but also from the [[Baltic States]] and [[Finland]]. The goal of the Society is to enforce, develop and support [[Iranian Studies]] in all subject areas of this field, in particular [[philology]] and [[linguistics]].

== History ==
The Society was founded in [[Oslo]] in 2010 on the initiative of the Founding President [[Ashk Dahlén]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranistics.com/organisation/scandinavian-society-iranian-studies - Iranistics Records of Iranian Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
The Society arranges academic events in the [[Scandinavia]]n countries on a regular basis for the purpose of promoting the interdisciplinary study of [[Iranian culture|Iranian civilization]] and knowledge of [[Iran]] and the [[Persian language|Persian-speaking]] world from the earliest periods to the present.
The 1st Triennial Iranian Studies Conference was held in [[Oslo]] on 30 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iranianstudies.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/1st-triennial-conference-report - 1st Triennial Conference of the Scandinavian Society for Iranian Studies (Report)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music]], '''''sostenuto''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɒ|s|t|ə|'|n|uː|t|oʊ}}, {{IPA-it|sosteˈnuːto|lang}}; Italian 'sustained') is usually a very [[legato]] style in which the notes are performed in a sustained manner beyond their normal values. It may imply a slowing of [[tempo]].

==Sostenuto pedal==
{{see also|Piano pedal#Sostenuto pedal}}
[[File:D274.jpg|thumb|right|The sostenuto pedal is the pedal in the middle under the [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] of the grand piano]]
On a modern [[grand piano]] with three [[piano pedals|pedals]], the middle pedal is usually a '''sostenuto pedal'''. It sustains ''only'' those notes that are being held down when the pedal is depressed, allowing future notes played to be unaffected. It is commonly abbreviated "S.P.", "Sost. Ped.", or "ThP." (from the German equivalent "Tonhalte-Pedal").

On some upright pianos and lower-quality grand pianos, the middle pedal sustains all notes in the bass register, but this is not a true sostenuto pedal. On other uprights, the middle pedal is a practice pedal (with a locking option), which makes the sound extremely quiet beyond the standard [[soft pedal]]. This is often achieved by [[mute (music)|dropping a felt cloth]] between the hammers and the strings when the practice pedal is depressed. Not all pianos have a sostenuto pedal, however. Some older, or modern low-quality uprights do not have this option. 

The sostenuto pedal should not be confused with the much more commonly used [[sustain pedal]], which undamps ''all'' the strings on the piano.

'''Structural building components''' are specialized structural [[building products]] designed, engineered and manufactured under controlled conditions for a specific [[Application software|application]]. They are incorporated into the overall building structural system by a [[building designer]]. Examples are wood or steel [[roof truss]]es, floor trusses, floor panels, [[I-joist]]s, or engineered beams and headers.

A structural building component manufacturer or truss manufacturer is an individual or organization regularly engaged in the manufacturing of components.

'''Taiwanization''' ({{zh|t=臺灣本土化運動}}), also known as the '''Taiwanese localization movement''', is a conceptual term used in [[Taiwan]] to emphasize the importance of a Taiwanese culture, society, economy, nationality, and [[Taiwanese identity|identity]] rather than to regard Taiwan as solely an appendage of [[China]]. This involves the teaching of the [[history of Taiwan]], [[geography of Taiwan|geography]], and [[culture of Taiwan|culture]] from a Taiwan-centric perspective, as well as promoting languages locally established in Taiwan, including [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] (Taiwanese), [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[Formosan languages|aboriginal languages]].

Originally part of the [[Taiwan independence]] movement and related to the '''Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign''' ({{zh|台灣正名運動|labels=no}}), some of Taiwanization's aims are now endorsed by some supporters of [[Chinese Unification]] on Taiwan.

The localization movement has been expressed in forms such as the use of [[language]] or [[dialect]] in the broadcast media and entire channels devoted to [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] affairs. Textbooks have been rewritten by scholars to more prominently emphasize Taiwan. The political compromise that has been reached is to teach both the history of Taiwan and the history of mainland China.

Some Taiwanese-owned companies or organizations established in earlier times have names containing the words "China" or "Chinese". They have been encouraged in recent years to change the word "China" in their names to "Taiwan" as an act of Taiwanization. This campaign for changing the names is known as the "Name Rectification Campaign" ({{zh|正名運動|labels=no}}) or "Taiwan Name Rectification". Many Taiwan-based companies in international sectors already identify themselves as "Taiwan"-based for clarity's sake. This keeps international customers from confusing them with an enterprise based in the People's Republic of China. Other Taiwan-based companies decline to change to a "Taiwanese" name because of expense or the political views held by important clients and company leaders.

== History and development ==
[[File:中華民國第一位民選首都市長吳三連於1951年勝選後 First People-elected Mayor of Taipei, the Capital of TAIWAN.jpg|thumb|[[Tangwai movement|Tangwai]] politicians in Taipei in 1951.]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}

No one can confirm when the concept of Taiwanization has started. Some say when the first large wave of Han people emigrated from mainland China to Taiwan in the mid-16th century, they must have wanted to maintain some independence from the control of the ruling class in their original hometown. Others say that only when the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], with its capital at Tainan, was built by the Zheng family in 1662, did this concept appear.

Most Chinese contemporary scholars of Mainland China believe the roots of the localization movement began during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1895 to 1945), when groups organized to lobby the [[Imperial Japan]]ese government for greater Taiwanese autonomy and home rule. After the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) took over Taiwan, the Taiwan home-rule groups were decimated in the wake of the [[February 28 Incident]] of 1947. The KMT viewed Taiwan primarily as a base to retake mainland China and quickly tried to subdue potential political opposition on the island. The KMT did little to promote a unique Taiwanese identity; often newly immigrated Chinese or "[[Mainland Chinese|mainlander]]s" as they were called, working in administrative positions, lived in neighborhoods where they were segregated from the Taiwanese. Others, especially poorer refugees, were shunned by the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo Taiwanese]] and lived among aborigines instead. The mainlanders often learned [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]]. However, since Mandarin was enforced as the official language of the Republic of China and Taiwanese was not allowed to be spoken in schools, the mainlanders who learned Taiwanese found their new language skills to diminish. As Taiwanese, or any language other than Mandarin, was forbidden in the military posts, many mainlanders whose family lived in [[Military dependents' village|martial villages]] only spoke Mandarin and perhaps their home language (e.g. [[Cantonese]], [[Shanghainese]], etc.). The promotion of [[Chinese nationalism]] within Taiwan and the fact that the ruling group on Taiwan were considered outsiders by some were the reasons cited for both the [[Taiwan independence]] movement and Taiwanization.

In the 1970s and 1980s there was a shift in power away from the KMT to people native to Taiwan. This, combined with cultural liberalization and the increasing remoteness of the possibility of retaking mainland China, led to a cultural and political movement which emphasized a Taiwan-centered view of history and culture rather than one which was China-centered or even, as before 1946, Japan-centered. Taiwanization was strongly supported by President [[Lee Teng-hui]].

The ''Bentuhua'' or ''localization/indigenization movement'' was sparked in the mid-1970s with the growing expression of ethnic discontent due to unequal distribution of political and cultural power between mainlanders and Taiwanese people. Beginning in the 1960s, Taiwan was enveloped by the problems of rapid industrial development, rural abandonment, labor disputes and the uneven distribution of access to wealth and social power. These changes, combined with the loss of several key allies, forced the KMT regime to institute limited reforms. The reforms permitted under Chiang Ching-kuo allowed indigenization to increase as leading dissidents generated a response to the government's failures. The dissident groups, united under the "[[tangwai movement|Tangwai]]", or “outside the party” banner, called for the government to accept the reality that it was only the government of Taiwan and not China. The key demands of the Tangwai involved instituting democracy and seeking international recognition as a sovereign state. Taiwanese demanded full civil rights as guaranteed under the ROC constitution and equal political rights as those experienced by the Mainlander elite.

The Taiwanese cultural elite fully promoted the development of ''Xiang tu'' literature and cultural activities, including rediscovering Taiwanese nativist literature written under Japanese colonial rule. The [[tangwai movement]] revived symbols of Taiwanese resistance to Japanese rule in the effort to mobilize ethnic Taiwanese. The opposition to the KMT's China-centered cultural policies resulted in dissidents crafting new national-historical narratives that placed the island of Taiwan itself at the center of the island's history. The Taiwanese emerged as a frequently colonized and often oppressed people. The concept of ''bentuhua'' was finally expressed in the cultural domain in the premise of Taiwan as a place with a unique society, culture and history. This principle has been largely adopted for understanding Taiwan's cultural representation and expressed in a variety of cultural activities, including [[Taiwanese literature movement|music, film and the literary and performing arts]].

The pressures of indigenization and the growing acceptance of a unique Taiwanese cultural identity have met opposition from more conservative elements of Taiwan society. Critics argue that the new perspective creates a “false” identity rooted in ethnic nationalism as opposed to an “authentic” Chinese identity, which is primordial and inherent. Many mainlanders living on Taiwan complain that their own culture is marginalized by ''bentuhua'', and initially expressed fear of facing growing alienation. In the past decade these complaints have subsided somewhat as Taiwan increasingly views itself as a pluralistic society that embraces many cultures and recognizes the rights of all citizens.

In the mid-to-late 1990s, gestures toward Taiwanization were increasingly adopted by pro-unification figures who, while supporting the Chinese nationalism of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], saw it as appropriate, or at least advisable, to display more appreciation for cultures of Taiwan. Pro-unification politicians such as [[James Soong]], the former head of the Government Information Office who once oversaw the limitation of Taiwanese dialects, began speaking in Hoklo on semi-formal occasions.

== Name Rectification Campaign ==

The "Name Rectification Campaign" includes efforts by the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) government beginning in 2000 to distance itself from [[China]] and rollback earlier sinicization efforts by taking actions such as removing Chinese influence from items within Taiwan control. While the [[Taiwanese localization movement]] may view such efforts as emphasizing the importance of Taiwan's culture, this section addresses the perspective of those who likely support the [[Chinese reunification]] of all of [[Greater China]] under a single political entity.

=== Origin ===
[[File:Wild-lily-movement.jpg|thumb|[[Wild Lily student movement|Wild Lily Movement]] in Taipei.]]
At the end of [[World War II]], Chinese [[Kuomintang]] forces [[Retrocession Day|took over]] Taiwan and soon began an effort to [[Sinicize#Taiwan|sinicize]] the population. Taiwanese urban elites were wiped out in the [[February 28 Incident]]. [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]] became the only language allowed in media and school to the exclusion of other [[languages of Taiwan]], as well as Japanese. Public institutions and corporations were given names that included the words "China" or "Chinese".  School history and geography lessons focused on China with little attention paid to Taiwan.  Street names in Taipei were changed from their original names to Chinese names that reflected the geography of China and Kuomintang ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = June Teufel | last = Dreyer | title = Taiwan’s Evolving Identity | url = http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.event_summary&amp;event_id=31149 Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | location = Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | quote = In order to shore up his government’s legitimacy, Chiang set about turning Taiwan’s inhabitants into Chinese. To use Renan’s terminology, Chiang chose to re-define the concept of shared destiny to include the mainland. Streets were re-named; major thoroughfares in Taipei received names associated with the traditional Confucian virtues. The avenue passing in front of the foreign ministry en route to the presidential palace was named chieh-shou (界壽), meaning "long live Chiang Kai-shek. Students were required to learn Mandarin and speak it exclusively; those who disobeyed and spoke Taiwanese, Hakka, or aboriginal tongues could be fined, slapped, or subjected to other disciplinary actions. | date = 17 July 2003 | accessdate = 20 May 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605131558/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.event_summary&amp;event_id=31149 | archivedate = 5 June 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/17827189.html|quote=The new KMT concluded that it must “Sinicize” Taiwan if it were ever to unify mainland China.

With the end of martial law in 1987 and the introduction of democracy in the 1990s after the [[Wild Lily student movement]], an effort began to re-assert Taiwanese identity and culture while trying to get rid of many Chinese influences imposed by the [[Kuomintang]].

=== Education and language campaign ===
In 2000, then-ROC president [[Lee Teng-hui]] began making statements such as "Taiwan culture is not a branch of Chinese culture" and "Taiwan's Minnan dialect is not a branch of [[Fujian]]'s [[Southern Min|Minnan]], dialect but rather a 'Taiwan dialect'&lt;ref name="hoping"&gt;Huining, Zhuang; Haixia, Huang. (19 March 2001) [[World News Connection]] ''Hoping for an Early Completion of the Great Cause of National Reunification. China's NPC Deputies, CPPCC Members on Cross-Strait Reunification Viewed.''&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan radio and TV increased their [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] programming.&lt;ref name="hoping"/&gt; These efforts were perceived in China as initial efforts towards breaking the ties between Taiwan culture and Chinese culture by downplaying the long-term Chinese cultural and historic identification in that region.&lt;ref name="hoping"/&gt;

In April 2003, the Committee for Promoting Mandarin, which was part of Taiwan's Ministry of Education, released a legislation proposal entitled "Language Equality Law."&lt;ref name="suppressing"&gt;Weixue, Peng (Beijing Renmin Wang). (10 April 2003) [[Open Source Center|World News Connection]] ''Taiwan Strait Observation: Taiwan Authorities Are Suppressing 'Mandarin' and Promoting 'Cultural Taiwan Independence.'''&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed legislation sought to designate fourteen languages as the national languages of Taiwan.&lt;ref name="suppressing"/&gt; In mainland China, this was seen as an effort to diminish the use of [[standard Mandarin]] and its cultural influences in favor of revising the cultural and psychological foundations on the island of Taiwan by using other languages.&lt;ref name="suppressing"/&gt; The draft was not adopted.&lt;ref name="suppressing"/&gt;

The textbook issue was raised in November 2004, when a group of lawmakers, legislative candidates and supporters of the pro-independence [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] (TSU) urged the [[ROC Ministry of Education]] to publish Taiwan-centric history and geography textbooks for school children as part of the Taiwanization campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Sofia - [[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Taipei Central News Agency]]. (9 November 2004) [[Open Source Center|World News Connection]] ''Tsu Lawmakers Call For Taiwan-centric History Textbooks.''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the resulting draft outline of history course for regular senior middle schools was criticized by a variety of groups,&lt;ref&gt;[[People's Daily|People's Daily Online]] (11 November 2004) ''[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200411/11/eng20041111_163629.html Islanders Criticize Taiwan Authorities' Outline of New History Course.]''&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Chen Shui-bian]] responded that "to seek the truth of Taiwan's history" is not equal to [[desinicization]] nor an act of independence and indicated that he would not interfere with the history editing and compilation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Chieh-yu, Lin. (19 November 2004) [[Taipei Times]] ''[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/11/19/2003211651 Chen says he's open-minded when it comes to history.]'' Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Lilian. (21 July 2007) [[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Taiwan Headlines]] ''[http://www.cna.com.tw/eng/cepread.php?id=200707210028 Education Minister Denies Accusations On Textbooks.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposals to revise Taiwan's history textbooks were condemned in February 2007 by the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[Taiwan Affairs Office|Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council]] as being part of the desinicization campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[[PLA Daily|Beijing Jiefangjun Bao]] (1 February 2007) ''[http://www.chinamil.com.cn/site1/xwpdxw/2007-02/01/content_723435.htm Chinese State Council Taiwan Affairs Office Condemns Taiwan Authorities Revising History Textbooks as Desinicization Move.]''&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, the [[Education in Taiwan|Taiwan Ministry of Education]] released a study that found 5,000 textbook terms, some relating to Chinese culture, as being "unsuitable".&lt;ref&gt;[[China Post]] (22 July 2007) ''[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/print/115697.htm Ministry of Education study concludes 5,000 textbook terms 'unsuitable'.]''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kuomintang]] saw this as part of a textbook censorship desinicization campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[[China Post]] (23 July 2007) ''Opposition slams Taiwan denial textbook censorship desinicization campaign.''&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals have not been adopted.

=== Name change campaign ===
[[File:Taiwan ROC Passport.jpg|thumb|[[ROC passport|Republic of China (Taiwan) passport]].]]
[[File:Taichung Post Office, Taiwan 20070831.jpg|thumb|[[Chunghwa Post|Taiwan Post Co.]] post office in [[Taichung]].]]
Between 2002 and 2007, the ROC government under Chen Shui-bian took steps to revise the terms "China", "Republic of China", "Taipei", and others that impart an association with the Chinese culture.&lt;ref name="relations"&gt;[[Ta Kung Pao|Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao]] (11 May 2002) [[Open Source Center|World News Connection]] ''Ta Kung Pao Editorial Criticizes Forces Promoting 'Taiwan' as Official Name. Rectification of Taiwan's Name' Is Actually for the Sake of Pursuing 'Taiwan Independence.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[China Post]] (8 February 2007) ''The DPP's Cultural Revolution.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[China Post]] (11 February 2007) ''The name-change fever.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hsiu-chuan, Shih. (21 March 2007) [[Taipei Times]] ''[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/03/21/2003353189 Wu's transfer to US upsets pan-blues.]'' Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the "Name Rectification Campaign" made significant advances in replacing the terms "China", "Republic of China", or "Taipei" with the term "Taiwan" on official documents, in the names of Taiwan-registered organizations, companies, and public enterprises on the island, and in the names of businesses stationed abroad.&lt;ref name="relations"/&gt; In 2003, the ROC Foreign Ministry issued a new [[Republic of China passport|passport]] with the word "Taiwan" printed in English on its cover.&lt;ref&gt;Qing, Hua (Beijing Renmin Ribao) (17 June 2003) [[Open Source Center|World News Connection]] ''What 'Convenience' Does the Addition of 'Taiwan' Provide? Column Criticizes Decision to Add 'Taiwan' to Passports.''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in January 2005, Taiwan adopted a Westernized writing format for government documents, denied that it was an attempt at desinicization, and promoted the actions as "a concerted effort at globalizing Taiwan's ossified bureaucracies and upgrading the nation's competitive edge."&lt;ref&gt;Shu-ling, Ko. (4 January 2005) [[Taipei Times]] ''[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2005/01/04/2003217950 Using Westernized writing format isn't an issue: premier.]'' Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Campaigning in this area continued in March 2006, where the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] sought to change the Republic of China year designation used in Taiwan to the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name="calendar"&gt;Wu, Lilian - [[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Taipei Central News Agency]]. (21 March 2006) [[Open Source Center|World News Connection]] ''Taiwan Lawmakers Say Changing Year Designation To Cost Nearly $309 Million.''&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of the year 2006 being referred to as the "95th year of the ROC"—with the 1912 founding of the Republic of China being referred to as "the first year of the ROC"—the year 2006 would be identified as 2006 in official usage such as on banknotes, IDs, national health insurance cards, driver's licenses, diplomas and wedding certificates.&lt;ref name="calendar"/&gt; This was viewed as the government trying another angle for desinicization by removing any trace of China from Taiwan.&lt;ref name="calendar"/&gt;

In February 2007, the term "China" was replaced by the term "Taiwan" on Taiwan postage stamps to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the [[February 28 Incident]] that began on 28 February 1947 that was violently suppressed by the Kuomintang (KMT).&lt;ref&gt;[[China Post]] (14 February 2007) ''Desinicization likely to continue.''&lt;/ref&gt; In that same month, the name of the official [[mail|postal service]] of Taiwan was changed from the [[Chunghwa Post|Chunghwa Post Co.]] to The Taiwan Post Co.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Sophia. (23 July 2007) [[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Taiwan Headlines]]. ''[http://www.taiwanheadlines.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=81816&amp;CtNode=39 Cgj Not To Deal With Name Change Constitutionality Issue.]''&lt;/ref&gt; The company's name was changed back on 1 August 2008, and the names on the postal stamps were reversed in late 2008, soon after the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) candidate [[Ma Ying-Jeou]] won back presidency and ended 8 years of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) rule.

In March 2007, the name plate of the [[Republic of China diplomatic missions|ROC Embassy in Panama]] was revised both to include the word "Taiwan" in parentheses between the words "the Republic of China" and "Embassy" in both of its Chinese and Spanish titles, and to omit the ROC national emblem.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Ramon; Wu, Sofia. (25 March 2007) [[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Taiwan Headlines]] ''[http://www.taiwanheadlines.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=67612&amp;CtNode=39 Taiwan Embassies, Representative Offices in Latin America Replace Name Plates.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the name-change movement argue that the Republic of China no longer exists, as it did not include Taiwan when it was founded in 1912 and mainland China is now controlled by the Chinese Communist Party as the People's Republic of China.  Furthermore, the ambiguity surrounding the [[legal status of Taiwan]] as a result of the [[Treaty of peace with Japan]] and [[Treaty of San Francisco]] after World War II, means that the Republic of China was merely a military occupier of Taiwan.  As Japan relinquished its sovereignty over Taiwan without passing it to a specific country, it is argued that Taiwan ought to be deemed a land belonging to no country, whose international status has yet to be defined.

=== Constitutional and political campaign ===
In October 2003, President [[Chen Shui-bian]] announced that Taiwan would seek a new constitution suitable for the Taiwan people that would turn Taiwan into a "normal country."&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;Wu, Lilian - [[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Taipei Central News Agency]]. (6 October 2003) [[Open Source Center|World News Connection]] ''President Wants Constitution That Fits Taiwan People.''&lt;/ref&gt; In explaining what a normal country was in the context of desinicization and the 1992 [[One-China policy]], Chen Shui-bian stated,

{{quote|Taiwan is an independent sovereign country, but a lot of people do not think of Taiwan as a country and do not dare to call Taiwan an independent sovereign nation, which is quite abnormal. ... Taiwan must not fall into the trap of being regarded as part of China, or become a special region of China like Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=December 2012}}}}

In response, the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] within Taiwan sought to portray President Chen Shui-bian and his [[Democratic Progressive Party]] as radicals intent on implementing revolutionary desinicization that would disenfranchise various ethnic groups within Taiwan who have an affinity for China and the Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;Tai-lin, Huang - [[Taipei Times]]. (15 November 2003) [[Open Source Center|World News Connection]] ''Pan-Blue Portraying Green Camp As "Radical"''&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) adopted a resolution to identify those responsible for the 1947 [[February 28 Incident]] massacre of Taiwanese people in order to charge them with [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]]. The effort also sought to remove the "remnants of dictatorship" traced to that sixty-year-old incident.&lt;ref name="incident"&gt;[[China Post]] (8 February 2007) ''DPP urges probe to 'uncover truth' of 2-28.''&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen in mainland China as being in line with a series of desinicization actions by both the Taiwan government and the DPP to rid both Chiang and China from the Taiwan public scene.&lt;ref name="incident"/&gt; Some applauded this as a courageous act of seeking justice. Others criticized the request, seeing it as "rubbing salt into wounds" by playing up the historical issues for political gain.&lt;ref name="incident"/&gt;

=== Other campaign ===
In March 2007, it was noted that the destruction of the [[Western Line, Taiwan|Western Line]] railway base found below the floor of the [[Taipei Main Station]] and built in 1893 by [[Qing Empire]]-appointed Governor of [[Taiwan Province (Qing)|Taiwan Province]] [[Liu Mingchuan]] was part of the government's call for desinicization through removal of the Chinese site.&lt;ref&gt;Ting-wei, Ku. (12 March 2007) [[Taipei Times]] ''[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/03/12/2003351975 Picking and {{sic|nolink=y|chosing|expected=choosing}} the history we want to keep.]'' Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, President Chen Shui-bian announced that he would allow mainland Chinese diplomas or students into Taiwan during the rest of his presidential term.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taipei Times]] (24 July 2007) ''[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/07/24/2003371081 Chen's Diploma Policy Is Backward.]'' Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, was not achieved.

=== Impact ===
One phenomenon that has resulted from the Taiwanization movement is the advent of [[Taike]] subculture, in which young people consciously adopt the wardrobe, language and cuisine to emphasize the uniqueness of popular, grassroots Taiwanese culture, which in previous times had often been seen as provincial and backwards by the mainstream.

In April 2002, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) noted both active efforts on the part of Taiwan to push ahead its Taiwanization policy and intensified United States-Taiwan military cooperation. In response, the CPC publicly reminded its military to be prepared to achieve its goal of "[[Chinese reunification]]" (intended to mean making Taiwan a part of the People's Republic of China) through military means. In addition, the CPC sought assistance from the United States to address the matter with Taiwan. As part of making the upcoming U.S. visit by then vice-president [[Hu Jintao]] go smoothly, the United States cautioned the [[Chen Shui-bian]] administration not to "go too far" in [[cross-Strait relations]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ming Pao|Hong Kong Ming Pao]] (12 April 2002) [[Open Source Center|World News Connection]] ''U.S. Cautions Taiwan Not To "Go Too Far" in Cross-Strait Relations.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, the Communist Party of China (CPC) general secretary Hu Jintao and the former ROC Vice President and then chairman of the Kuomintang party (KMT) [[Lien Chan]] shook hands. Billed as a historic moment, this was the first handshake by the top leaders of the KMT and the CPC in 60 years.&lt;ref name="handshake"&gt;[[People's Daily|People's Daily Online]] (30 April 2005) ''[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200504/30/eng20050430_183378.html A moment that goes down in history.]''&lt;/ref&gt; In remarking on the handshake, chairman Chan noted that it was a turning point where the KMT and the CPC would work together to bring about peaceful [[cross-strait relations]] and specifically distanced the KMT from Taiwan independence and desinicization efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Binhua, Chen; Yong, Zhang - [[Xinhua News Agency|Beijing Xinhua Domestic Service]] (30 April 2005) [[Open Source Center|World News Connection]] ''Hu Jintao, Lien Chan Hold 'Formal Talks;' Exchange Views on Developing Cross-Strait Ties.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support and opposition ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}
[[File:Kuomintang nanjing.jpg|thumb|[[Lien Chan|KMT Chairman Lien Chan]] [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|visited]] Mainland China in 2005 to oppose the [[Taiwan independence]] movement.]]
Significant outcries surfaced both within Taiwan and abroad opposing the concept of Taiwan localization in the early years after President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]'s death, denouncing it as the "independent Taiwan movement" (Chinese: 台獨運動).  Vocal opponents are primarily the 1949-generation Mainlanders, or older generations of Mainlanders living in Taiwan that had spent their formative years and adulthood on the pre-1949 mainland Republic of China, and native Taiwanese who identify with a pan-Han Chinese cultural identity.  They included people ranging from academics like [[Chien Mu]], reputed to be the last prominent Chinese intellectual opposing the [[conventional wisdom]] take on the [[May Fourth Movement]], politicians like [[Lien Chan]], from a family with a long history of active pan-Chinese patriotism despite being native Taiwanese, to gang mobsters like [[Chang An-lo]], a leader of the notorious [[United Bamboo Gang]].

The opposing voices were subsequently confined to the fringe in the mid 2000s Taiwan itself. Issues persist, particularly supporters of the [[Pan-Blue coalition]], which advocates retaining a strong link to mainland China, dispute over such issues as what histories to teach. Nonetheless both of the two major political forces in Taiwan reached a consensus, and the movement has overwhelming support among the population.  This is in part due to the 1949-generation Mainlanders have gradually passed on from the scene, and politicians supporting and opposing the Taiwanese independence movement both realize a majority of Taiwan's current residents, either because they are born in Taiwan to Mainlander parents with no collective memories of their ancestral homes, or they are native Taiwanese, thus feeling no historical connotations with the entire pre-1949 Republic of China on mainland China, support the movement as such.

In mainland China, the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] government has on the surface adopted a neutral policy on Taiwanization and its highest-level leaders publicly proclaim it does not consider the Taiwanization movement to be either a violation of its [[One China Policy]] or equivalent to the independence movement. Nonetheless, the state-owned media and academics employed by organizations such as universities' Institutes of Taiwan Studies or the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS) periodically release study results, academic journal articles, or editorials strongly criticizing the movement as "the cultural arm of Taiwanese independence movement" (Chinese: 文化台獨) with the government's tacit approval, showing the PRC government's opposition towards Taiwanization.

Nowadays, another source of significant opposition to the Taiwanization movement remains in the [[overseas Chinese]] communities in Southeast Asia and the Western world, who identify more with the historic pre-1949 mainland Republic of China or pre-Taiwanization movement ROC on Taiwan that oriented itself as the rump legitimate government of China. A great many are themselves refugees and dissidents who fled mainland China, either directly or through Hong Kong or Taiwan, during the founding of the People's Republic of China and the subsequent periods of destructive policies (such as the [[Land Reform]], the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]], [[Great Leap Forward]], or the [[Cultural Revolution]]), [[Hong Kong]] anti-Communist immigrants who fled Hong Kong in light of the Handover to the PRC in 1997, or Mainlanders living in Taiwan who moved to the West in response to the Taiwanization movement. Conversely, the current population of Taiwan regard these overseas Chinese as foreigners akin to [[Singapore]]an Chinese, as opposed to the pre-Taiwanization era when they were labeled as fellow Chinese compatriots. The PRC has capitalized on this window of opportunity in making overtures to the traditionally anti-Communist overseas Chinese communities, including gestures in supporting traditional Chinese culture and dumping explicitly Communist tones in overseas communications. This results in a decline of active political opposition to the PRC from overseas Chinese when compared with the times before the Taiwanization movement in Taiwan.

In Hong Kong, Taiwanization movements have pushed localization or pro-Chinese Communist tilts among the traditionally pro-Republic of China individuals and organizations. A prominent example is Chu Hai College, whose academic degree programs were recognized officially by the Hong Kong SAR government in May 2004, and registered as an "Approved Post-secondary College" with the Hong Kong SAR government since July of the same year. It has since been renamed the Chu Hai College of Higher Education (珠海學院) and no longer registered with the Republic of China's Ministry of Education. New students from 2004 have been awarded degrees in the right of Hong Kong rather than Taiwan.

==Role in domestic politics==
{{Main|Tangwai movement}}
Even though it is a broad consensus currently regarding the overall ideology of Taiwanization, there are still deep disputes over practical policies between the three main political groups of [[Taiwan independence]], [[Chinese reunification]], and supporters of [[Chinese culture]]. Pro-independence supporters argue that Taiwan is and should be enhancing an identity which is separate from the Chinese one, and in more extreme cases advocates the removal of Chinese "imprints". Meanwhile, some would argue that Taiwan should create a distinctive identity that either includes certain Chinese aspect or exists within a broader Chinese one. Those who support Chinese reunification call for a policy of enhancing the Chinese identity. Groups that support [[Chinese reunification]] and [[Chinese nationalism]] have emphasized the distinction between Taiwanization and what some perceive as [[desinicization]] and argued that they do not oppose the promotion of a Taiwanese identity, but rather oppose the use of that identity to separate itself from a broader Chinese one. On the other hand, a few apolitical groups have claimed that most of the political factions merely use these points to win support for elections{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}.

'''The Headbangers''' were a [[professional wrestling]] [[tag team]] consisting of [[Mosh (wrestler)|Mosh]] (Charles Warrington) and [[Thrasher (wrestler)|Thrasher]] (Glenn Ruth). As the name of the team implied, their [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] was that they were a pair of [[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]], complete with [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] related T-shirts, kilts, piercings, goatees, shaved heads, and black [[Body painting#Face painting|face paint]].

==History==
===Beginning (1994–1996)===
They were both trained by [[Larry Sharpe (wrestler) | Larry Sharpe]] in New Jersey in the early 1990s. Warrington and Ruth teamed up in 1994 as the Spiders in their home state, New Jersey, for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]. They made an [[Eastern Championship Wrestling]] appearance in June 1994, losing to [[The Bad Breed]] ([[Axl Rotten|Axl]] and [[Ian Rotten]]). The Spiders had a brief stint in Dallas for the NWA in 1995. Later that year they moved down to Tennessee in [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW). It was there that they changed their gimmicks to the Headbangers. Their slogan was "Real men wear skirts." During their time in SMW, they feuded with [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] ([[Ricky Morton]] and [[Robert Gibson (wrestler)|Robert Gibson]]) and [[The Thugs]] ([[Tracy Smothers]] and [[Tony Anthony]]), and later sided with [[Jim Cornette]] and [[Terry Gordy]] in their feud with [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]] over the [[SMW Heavyweight Championship]]. By the end of the year, SMW folded and they joined the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA). In December 1995, they debuted as jobbers in the WWF as the Spiders, the Arachnoids, and even used their real names. On an episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' they got a World Tag Team Title shot against the Smoking Gunns. They returned to the USWA.

===World Wrestling Federation===
==== WWF Tag Team Champions====
The team debuted on WWF television on the November 24, 1996 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'' under their Headbangers gimmick defeating Alex Porteau and 
[[Justin Credible|Aldo Montoya]]. Shortly after that, they began wearing [[nun]]s' clothing and billed as the Flying Nuns (a play on the [[The Flying Nun|television show of the same name]]), Sister Angelica and Mother Smucker. They were also humorously billed as hailing from a monastery in the Himalayas. On an episode of ''[[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night|Shotgun Saturday Night]]'', [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] showed up to manage the Nuns. After the Nuns defeated [[The Godwinns]], Love renamed them the Sisters of Love.&lt;ref name=wwf1997&gt;{{cite web|title=1997|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/97.htm|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gimmick was short-lived, but they kept the skirts when they returned to being The Headbangers in January 1997.&lt;ref name=wwf1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|last=Baines|first=Tim|title=Bangers a smash: Eccentric, yes, but WWF tag team caught up in fun|work=SLAM!

Throughout 1997, The Headbangers (who were [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Tweener|Tweeners]]), [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with The Godwinns, as well as [[Doug Furnas]] and [[Philip Lafond|Phil Lafon]], often finding themselves on the losing end. They faced [[The Road Warriors|Legion of Doom]] during their surprise return match on February 24 to a double [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]]. At [[WrestleMania 13]], The Headbangers won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|four-way elimination match]] for a shot at the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]]. The team was seen on [[New York City|New York]]'s [[WABC-TV]] in June, which re-aired on WWF programming.

The Headbangers won the vacant Tag Team title at [[Ground Zero: In Your House]] after Mosh pinned [[Owen Hart]], thanks to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Run-in|run-in interference]] by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]].&lt;ref name=wwftag&gt;{{cite web|title=W.W.W.F./W.W.F./W.W.E.

They faced the [[New Age Outlaws]] in their debut match as a team on October 20 and frequently challenged them into the following the year for the Tag Team title.

The two are seen backstage playing with [[Bret Hart]]'s son, Blade, in the [[1998 in film|1998]] [[documentary film]] ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]''. The footage depicts events from the previous year.

Both Mosh and Thrasher entered the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Royal Rumble]] and both lasted over 10 minutes before Mosh was eliminated by [[Robert Maillet|Kurrgan]] and Thrasher by Steve Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWF Royal Rumble 1998|work=Hoffco Inc.|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/rr98.html|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 17, 1998, The Headbangers won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]], which aired on the February 23 edition of Raw Is War. They feuded with [[The Quebecers]] and the [[The Oddities (professional wrestling)|Oddities]] throughout the year and become the first [[MCW Tag Team Championship|Maryland Championship Wrestling Tag Team Champions]] on August 18 defeating Jimmy Cicero and Julio Sanchez in the finals of a tournament.&lt;ref name=mcw&gt;{{cite web|title=Maryland Championship Wrestling Tag Team Title|work=Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/md/mcw/mcw-t.html|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Split and Reunion====
The Headbangers were both meant to compete in the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 Royal Rumble]], but Thrasher suffered a (legitimate) knee injury and was shelved while Mosh was (kayfabe) attacked backstage by [[Viscera (wrestler)|Mabel]] as a way to write both men off television. While Thrasher was injured, Mosh would be repackaged as Beaver Cleavage and then Chaz, performed in singles competition and began having problems with his on-screen girlfriend, [[Marianna Komlos]].&lt;ref name=owwchaz&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrestler Profiles: Chaz Warrington|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/c/chaz.html|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[kayfabe]] arrested on an episode of ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' in September after Komlos claimed he [[Domestic violence|hit her]].&lt;ref name=owow/&gt;&lt;ref name=owwchaz/&gt; After Chaz's match on October 5, Glenn Ruth (Thrasher) showed GTV footage of Mariana applying makeup to create the effect of wounds.&lt;ref name=owow/&gt;&lt;ref name=wwf1999&gt;{{cite web|title=1999|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/99.htm|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved her accusations false, and The Headbangers subsequently reunited. They then took on a gimmick where they dressed as the opponents that they feuded with, such as the [[Dudley Boyz]] and [[Mean Street Posse]]. The duo later turned heel and began to dress in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], which included wearing breast cones.

Mosh entered in the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|2000 Royal Rumble]] alone eliminated by [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Rumble 2000|work=Pro Wrestling History|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble.html#00|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, The Headbangers continued performing in tag team and singles matches.&lt;ref name=wwf2000&gt;{{cite web|title=2000|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/00.htm|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men participated in the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore]] [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] at [[WrestleMania 2000]] where Thrasher held the title for [[List of WWE Hardcore Champions|43 seconds]] defeating [[Joey Abs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W.W.F./W.W.E.

Glenn Ruth was released from the WWF in July 2000 and Charles Warrington was released from the WWF in July 2001.

===Criticism by WWE===
Years after their departure from the company, The Headbangers have borne the brunt of criticism by [[WWE]] media. One example can be found in a 2007 article in ''[[WWE Magazine]]'' about the history of WWE champions. The article criticized wrestlers who are considered not worthy of winning a belt they held. The Headbangers were included in this article for their supposedly poor [[World Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Championship]] reign.&lt;ref&gt;''[[WWE Magazine]]'', June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The article suggested that the team had the titles by default since it was "in between the eras of [[The Smoking Gunns]] and the [[New Age Outlaws]]."

WWE's ''Raw 15th Anniversary'' magazine also includes a list of 15 superstars who "overstayed" their welcomes in the company. This has The Headbangers at #2, behind only [[Scott Steiner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tons Of News: Christy, Steiner, Hassan, Too Cool’, Kennedy

===Independent circuit (2011–2015)===
Mosh and Thrasher reunited on the independent circuit in 2011. They are members of the [[NWA Ring Warriors]] roster. They wrestled for [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]] multiple times. On August 12, 2011, The Headbangers were in the battle royal won by [[Zach Gowen]]. On December 17, 2011, The Headbangers defeated Necro Butcher and Mad Man Pondo. December 31, 2011, The Headbangers lost to Shockwave The Robot and 2 Tuff Tony. The Headbangers then lost two ten-man tag team matches while teaming with Bull Pain, Jake Manning and Colt Cabana.&lt;ref name="onlineworldofwrestling.com"&gt;http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/h/headbangers/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosh and Thrasher appeared on the [[Ring of Honor]] [[pay-per-view]] [[Best in the World 2012: Hostage Crisis|Best in the World]] on June 24, 2012 as the masked tag team Guardians of Truth, managed by the [[Truth Martini]]. They lost to the [[Briscoe Brothers]]. Later on, the two would unmask themselves and go on to compete as The Headbangers. They then competed on the Independent Circuit. In March 2013, both Headbangers were present during a ''[[WWE Smackdown]]'' taping. On June 18, 2013, The Headbangers defeated The South Side Playaz Club (Craig Steele and Joe Hardway) at PWS Dream on 6th Anniversary iPPV.

The Headbangers made their debut for Championship Wrestling Entertainment (CWE) competing in a triple threat match at Wrestlefest 2015.

===Return to WWE (2016)===
The duo made their first appearance as a team in WWE since 2000 on the August 30, 2016 episode of ''SmackDown Live'' as heels and participants of the [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Championship]] tournament, losing against [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]] in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Mike|title=FORMER WWF TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS SAY THEY WILL RETURN TO WWE ON SMACKDOWN THIS TUESDAY|url=http://pwinsider.com/article/104333/former-wwf-tag-team-champions-say-they-will-return-to-wwe-on-smackdown-this-tuesday.html?p=1|publisher=PWInsider|date=August 26, 2016|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They returned on the November 1 episode of ''SmackDown'', losing to [[The Usos]] in a [[Survivor Series (2016)|Survivor Series]] qualifying match. Then they were seen again on the 15 November 900th ''SmackDown'' episode, teaming with other heel tag teams.

'''''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún''''' is a book containing two [[narrative poem]]s and related texts composed by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. It was published by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] and [[HarperCollins]] on 5 May 2009.

The two poems that make up most of the book were probably written during the 1930s, and were inspired by the legend of [[Sigurd]] and the fall of the [[Niflungs]] in [[Norse mythology]].{{clarify|reason=clarify on norse/germanic sources and naming|date=September 2018}} Both poems are in a form of [[alliterative verse]] inspired by the traditional verse of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century. [[Christopher Tolkien]] has added copious notes and commentary on his father's work.

==Plot==

===The New Lay of the Völsungs===

====Upphaf====
After the creation of the Nine Worlds by the [[Aesir]], the walls of [[Asgard]] are besieged by an army of [[jötunn]]s and [[troll]]s. Wielding the hammer [[Mjöllnir]], [[Thor]] succeeds in driving these "foes immortal" back to [[Jotunheim]]. However, there are new perils to come.

A female seer prophesies the apocalyptic battle of [[Ragnarök]] and speaks of how [[Odin]] shall be slain by the wolf [[Fenrir]] and Thor by the [[Midgard serpent]]. There is but one chance for the doom of the nine worlds to be averted. If on the day of battle a mortal warrior, a slayer of serpents and descendant of Odin, fights alongside the gods, the forces of evil shall be defeated and the world shall be reborn.

In response, Odin scatters his seed among mortals in hopes of birthing "the world's chosen". Although many great heroes soon join him in [[Valhalla]], the serpent slayer's coming continues to be awaited.

====Andvari's gold====
Ages later, Odin, [[Loki]], and [[Hoenir]] arrive at the cave of the [[Norse dwarves|dwarf]] [[Andvari]]. There, they encountered the demon [[Hreidmar]]'s son [[Ótr]] and, thinking him to be merely a fishing [[otter]], Loki slays him with a stone, removes his [[Fur|pelt]], and steals his catch of salmon. Enraged, Hreidmar and his other sons, [[Fafnir]] and [[Regin]], bind the three gods in unbreakable chains and demand that Otr's pelt be covered with gold as [[weregild]] for his death.

Seeking to pay the ransom, Loki seeks out the dwarf Andvari and extorts the gold ransom. Although Andvari attempts to conceal a golden ring, Loki seizes it as well. Enraged, Andvari vows that both the ring and the gold will be the death of all who possess them. Pleased, Loki returns and delivers the gold to Hreidmar and his sons. Although Loki gloatingly informs them of the curse, Hreidmar is unimpressed and boasts of the fortune he now possesses.

====Signý====
On the coasts of the North, [[Rerir]] the sea lord, grandson of [[Odin]], conducts raids in Viking [[longship]]s. He is succeeded as king by his son Völsung. The latter, whom Odin favours, has been given a [[valkyrie]] as his wife. She bears twins, [[Sigmund]] and [[Signý]], during her husband's reign.

Years later, [[Siggeir]], [[King of the Geats|King of the Gauts]] sends an emissary and demands Signý's hand in marriage as the price of peace. Sigmund counsels his father to arrange the marriage, suggesting that the Gauts will prove valuable allies.

At the wedding feast, Odin enters the hall under the veil of a hoary bearded elder under the name [[Odin's names|Grímnir]]. He drives a sword into the oak at the center of the hall and dares the men present to pull it out. After all others try and fail, Sigmund at last succeeds in pulling it from the oak. King Siggeir, coveting the sword, offers Sigmund a fortune in gold in exchange for it. Unmoved, Sigmund boasts that the sword was made for his hands and vows never to sell it.

Enraged, Siggeir declares war on King Völsung, who is slain on a beach after cutting down many Gautish warriors. Although Signý pleads for the lives of her brothers, Siggeir orders them to be bound to trees in the forest and left for the wolves to eat. Although his nine brothers perish, Sigmund slays the she-wolf and escapes into an enchanted cave. There he mates with his sister, who has entered the cave in the guise of an elvish maiden. Nine months later, she bears a son, [[Sinfjötli]].

When Sinfjötli comes of age, he visits his father in the cave and delivers the sword of Grímnir. As the years pass, father and son range through Gautland as outlaws, slaying and plundering many men. Eventually, they infiltrate the hall of Siggeir, slay the watchmen, and vow that no one inside shall be spared. Although they ask Signý to leave with them, she refuses and elects to die at her husband's side.

====The Death of Sinfjötli====
Laden with the pillaged loot of Siggeir's hall, Sigmund and Sinfjötli return by ship to the land of the Völsungs. Together they rule for many years, slaying seven kings and sacking cities far and near. Although he will live to regret it, Sigmund takes a queen from among the war captives.

Loathing the man who slew her father, the Queen brews a poisoned brew of wine for Sinfjötli. Sigmund, suspecting that the wine has been tampered with, drains the cup instead of Sinfjötli and remains unharmed. Enraged, the Queen brews a beaker of poisoned beer, which again is offered to Sinfjötli but drunk by his father with no harm. Still determined to slay Sinfjötli, the Queen also delivers him a beaker of poisoned [[ale]]. This time the cup is drunk by Sinfjötli himself, who to the horror of Sigmund falls dead. Sinfjötli is then welcomed in [[Valhalla]] by grandfather King Völsung, who comments that the serpent slayer is still awaited.

====Sigurd born====
As the years pass, Sigmund grows old, having lost both his son and his treacherous Queen. Eventually, however, he learns of the beauteous Princess [[Sigrlinn]]. Although seven young sons of kings are also asking for her hand, Sigrlinn marries Sigmund, preferring to be the mother of a mighty hero.

Enraged at this slight, the seven sons of kings invade the land of Völsung. Sigmund vows that they will be greeted by the sword of Grímnir and slays many on the field of battle. However, he is soon confronted by a one-eyed warrior. As the warrior's spear clashes with Sigmund's sword, the blade of Grímnir breaks asunder. Severely wounded, Sigmund sinks to the ground.

Although Sigrlinn vows to heal his wounds, Sigmund refuses to permit this, insisting that [[Odin]] summon him to Valhalla. He prophesies that her unborn child will be the serpent slayer and orders her to carefully preserve the fragments of Grímnir's gift. He dies and Sigrlinn is carried into slavery. However, when the parentage of her son is revealed, Sigrlinn is wed to the king of that land. [[Sigurd]] is sent to be fostered by [[Regin]], the son of [[Hreidmar]].

====Regin====
Years later, Otr's ransom remains in the keeping of Regin's brother [[Fafnir]], who has been transformed into a [[European dragon|dragon]]. Coveting the gold hoard, Regin goads Sigurd into fighting Fafnir by accusing him of [[cowardice]]. When an enraged Sigurd demands to know the reason, Regin relates the story of Otr's murder by Loki and the [[weregild]] paid by the [[Aesir]] in recompense. According to Regin, [[Hreidmar]] refused to share the gold with his sons and was subsequently slain by Fafnir. Unimpressed, Sigurd asks Regin whether he desires his brother's death for justice or the gold hoard. Regin claims that he desires only to avenge his father. The gold and the glory, he adds, are for Sigurd to keep.

Twice Regin attempts to forge a sword for Sigurd, only to see the latter effortlessly break them. At last, Sigurd goes to his mother Sigrlinn and requests the broken pieces of Grímnir. Regin takes these and forges the sword [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]]. Although Sigurd wishes to slay Fafnir then and there, Regin tells him he must have a horse. In response, Sigurd buys the horse [[Grani]], who was sired by Odin's eight-legged steed [[Sleipnir]], and goes forth to kill Fafnir.

Later, as the dragon returns from taking a drink of water, Sigurd hides in a subterranean hollow and stabs the fell beast in the heart. As Fafnir's black blood drains over Sigurd and hardens his flesh, the young warrior withdraws his sword and leaps into the dragon's eyesight.

Although Fafnir warns him of the curse, Sigurd is unmoved, believing that the dragon wishes only to preserve his gold hoard. As the dragon belches out his last breath, Regin arrives and attempts to claim a share of the gold, commenting that he also had a role in the slaying and forged the sword. As Sigurd mocks his foster father's logic, Regin draws a knife and slices Fafnir's heart from his chest.

Ordering Sigurd to roast it for him, Regin departs. Meanwhile, Sigurd fashions a spit and kindles a fire. After burning his finger on the roasting heart, Sigurd puts the finger in his mouth and suddenly understands the language of birds.

As he listens to the birds speaking, Sigurd decides to eat the heart whole. Upon seeing Regin sneaking towards him with a drawn blade, Sigurd draws Gram and slays his foster father. He then loads the gold hoard onto Grani and departs, listening all the while to the birds singing of the [[valkyrie]] [[Brynhild]], her quarrel with [[Odin]], and the circle of fire which surrounds her sleeping form.

====Brynhildr====
After much riding on the back of Grani, Sigurd arrives at heights of Hindarfell. As they climb the mountainside, Grani leaps the ring of lightning and fire which surrounds Brynhild. As he reaches her side, Sigurd slices her [[corslet]] with Gram and awakens the sleeping valkyrie.

Addressing Sigurd, Brynhild explains how Odin doomed her to mate a mortal man. Impetuously, Brynhild had vowed to wed but one, the serpent slayer prophesied by the seeress of Asgard. When Sigurd relates his descent from Odin and the slaying of Fafnir, Brynhild is overjoyed and explains that the gods await his coming in [[Valhalla]]. Immediately after, Brynhild and Sigurd plight their troth. There is one complication, however.

Brynhild vows that she will only wed Sigurd when he has won a kingdom for himself. After cautioning her betrothed to avoid the abode of a witch-hearted woman, she returns to the height of Hindarfell and their ways sunder. Meanwhile, Sigurd rides toward the court of the [[Niflungs]]' at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]].

====Gudrun====
One morning, Princess [[Gudrun]] of the [[Niflungs]] approaches her mother, the witch-hearted Queen [[Grimhild]], with a disturbing dream. The Niflungs were hunting a [[stag]] with a golden coat and towering horns which evaded their grasp. It was Gudrun who caught him, only to see him stung with a shaft by a spiteful woman. Her mother then gave Gudrun a [[wolf]] to ease her grief and the former bathed her in the blood of her brothers. Her mother counsels her that evil dreams are often a good omen.

As they converse, Gudrun catches sight of a warrior riding toward the court arrayed for war. A short time later, Sigurd enters the court of the Niflungs, riding upon Grani. When her father [[Gjuki]] asks his name and parentage, he is overjoyed to learn that a Völsung warrior has arrived and summons a seat for Sigurd.

As the evening wears on, Gudrun's brother [[Gunnar]] seizes a harp and sings a lay of the Niflungs' longstanding war against King [[Attila the Hun|Atli]] of the [[Huns]]. As soon as he has finished, Sigurd takes the harp and sings of Brynhild and the gold hoard. Impressed, Gunnar and [[Högni]] invite Sigurd to dwell among them as long as he desires.

As time passes and Sigurd accompanies the Niflungs in war, the glory of the Burgundian lords spreads far and wide. Sigurd, however, continues to think of his father's lost kingdom and returns there by ship. There, as he looks upon the roofless remains of his father's mead hall, Odin appears and informs him that Gram is not destined to shine in the land of the Völsungs. As a result, Sigurd returns to Worms.

At a feast thrown to celebrate Sigurd's return, [[Grimhild]] advises her sons to regularise their alliance with Sigurd by marrying him to [[Gudrun]]. As Sigurd ponders how he soon will depart to claim Brynhild, Grimhild gives him a [[potion|love potion]] to drink. Shortly after, Gudrun enters the hall. Colored by the potion, Sigurd's mind is glamoured and his mood confounded.

====Brynhild betrayed====
Brynhild continues to await the coming of Sigurd, slaying almost every [[suitor]] who dares to call. Eventually, Odin arrives on horseback and armoured as an ancient king. He prophesies that she shall wed a mortal king before two winters pass. As he departs, a ring of fire surrounds her hall and Brynhild ponders that one man only can reach her now.

Meanwhile, a radiantly happy Sigurd weds Gudrun in a feast which lasts many days and nights in the mead hall of Worms. In addition, Sigurd and his in-laws swear a [[Blood brother|blood oath]] of eternal brotherhood. Although he and Gudrun are deeply happy in their marriage, a shadow remains in Sigurd's heart.

As time passes, the news of Brynhild and the gold hoard reaches Grimhild's ears. Certain that such a Queen will bring glory to her son's court, Grimhild counsels King [[Gunther|Gunnar]] that it is time for him to wed. Riding together, Sigurd, [[Högni]], and Gunnar depart for Brynhild's mead hall.

When they reach their destination, King Gunnar's horse shies away at the sight of the fire. Although the king smites the sides of his steed, Honi still refuses to go forward. With Sigurd's permission, Gunnar borrows Grani who, unfortunately, refuses to go forward under another rider. As a result, Sigurd springs to the rescue of his blood brother.

Through a spell cast by Grimhild, Sigurd rides through the fire in Gunnar's likeness. Stunned that a different warrior has ridden through the fire, Brynhild demands to know whether "Gunnar" is the masterless warrior she has vowed to wed. "Gunnar" reminds her that, as her oath has been fulfilled, she is doomed to wed him.

That night, Brynhild and Sigurd sleep in the same bed with a drawn sword lying between them. As dawn arrives, Brynhild at last agrees to marry "Gunnar."

====Strife====
During the nuptial feast after Brynhild's wedding to Gunnar, the bride catches sight of Sigurd seated next to Gudrun. As the blood drains from her horrified face, Grimhild's spell dissipates and Sigurd at last recalls the solemn oaths he swore to Brynhild. Realizing he can no longer honourably fulfill them, he stands as cold and unsmiling as a carven stone.

During a subsequent stag hunt, Brynhild and Gudrun bathe together in the [[Rhine]] River. Hautily, Brynhild comments that the water washing Gudrun will soon wash one far lovelier. Bristling, Gudrun snaps that she is far more queenly and is married to a better man, citing Sigurd's slaying of Fafnir. Unimpressed, Brynhild boasts of Gunnar's ride through the fire and lightning to claim her. With an icy laugh, Gudrun reveals that Sigurd rode through the fire and shows the ring of Brynhild on her own hand. Shocked and horrified, Brynhild departs the river and return to her [[wikt:bower|bower]], where she curses the [[Norns]] for framing her fate.

As days pass, Brynhild refuses to eat, drink, or depart her bed. When Gunnar approaches her, she call him a coward and curses him for causing her to break her oath to marry Sigurd. Reluctantly, Sigurd agrees to speak with her and, raising her coverlet, awakens her as he once did on the heights of Hindarfell. Seething with hatred, Brynhild addresses him as "cruel forswearer," and curses both him and Gudrun to an early death.

Stunned, Sigurd speaks lovingly to her of the spell that was cast upon him and admits that his only comfort has been to see her in Gunnar's hall. Although deeply touched, Brynhild states that it is too late to avert the evil of her curse. The one comfort which she can offer is that Sigurd shall die an honourable death at the point of a sword. Deeply grieved, Sigurd and Brynhild prepare for their respective fates.

Upon returning to Gudrun, Sigurd sadly tells her of the curse, saying, "Woe worth the words by women spoken!" When Gunnar later seeks his advice, Sigurd informs him that Brynhild's only doctor should be her husband. In response, Gunnar approaches his wife, offering her a hoard of gold and silver. Unmoved, Brynhild taunts him as "a Völsung's [[squire]], a [[vassal]]'s servant." She adds that she will depart his mead hall and leave Gunnar in disgrace unless he slays his [[brother in law]].

Stunned, Gunnar insists that he has sworn a blood oath of eternal brotherhood with Sigurd and will never break it. Brynhild, however, insists that Sigurd has already broken the oath by seducing her in Gunnar's shape after riding through the fire. Devastated, Gunnar departs Brynhild's room and spends many days pondering over what to do. At last, he summons his brother [[Högni]].

Gunnar declares to [[Högni]] that Sigurd has broken the oath and must be slain. Shocked, Högni suggests that Brynhild is lying out of jealousy. Gunnar insists, however, that he loves and trusts Brynhild more than anyone in the world and adds that, by slaying Sigurd, they will be masters again of their kingdom and able to seize the gold hoard of Fafnir. Saddened, Högni declares that, in the future, the [[Niflungs]] will miss both Sigurd's prowess in war and the mighty nephews he could have sired. Knowing that he swore no oath, Gunnar approaches his [[half brother]] [[Gotthorm]] and promises him both gold and lordship if he will kill Sigurd.

Later, as Sigurd hunts with his falcon, Gutthorm accuses him of being a "wife marrer" who wishes to usurp the Niflung throne. Enraged, Sigurd grips his sword hilt and orders Gutthorm to say no more if he values his life. Waiting for a more opportune moment, Gutthorm obeys.

At dawn the following morning, Gutthorm enters Sigurd's room with a drawn sword and stabs the serpent slayer, impaling him to the mattress. Awakening, Sigurd brandishes Gram and slays his attacker on the spot. In anguish, Gudrun awakens and, in horror, cradles her dying husband. Sigurd, however, orders her not to weep and not to blame her brothers for his death. As the light drains from his eyes, Sigurd declares,

:''"Brynhild wrought this:
:''best she loved me,
:''worst she dealt me,
:''worst belied me.
:''I Gunnar never
:''grieved nor injured;
:''oaths I swore him,
:''all fulfilled them!"&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun'', page 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Gudrun screams in anguish over Sigurd's body, Brynhild cackles in laughter. When Gunnar criticises her as a cold and "fell-hearted" woman, Brynhild curses the Niflungs for murdering their blood brother. She further reveals that Sigurd's seduction of her was a lie and that the sword Gram lay unsheathed between them. To the further horror of Gunnar, Brynhild announces that she is leaving him forever.

In vain do Gunnar and his courtiers attempt to sway her from her purpose. [[Högni]] alone insists that she was born for evil and that they are all better off without her. Attiring herself in a golden [[corslet]], Brynhild falls upon her sword. As she lies dying she requests that her corpse be burned in Sigurd's [[funeral pyre]]. She requests that Sigurd's hawks be laid at each side and his dog at their feet. Their horses are to be slain and laid beside them. The sword Gram is to lie unsheathed between them as on their only night together. Her wishes are obeyed and both Sigurd and Brynhild are carried to [[Valhalla]] in the flames of a [[Viking funeral]].

Later, [[Odin]] and the other Völsungs welcome the serpent slayer whose coming they have awaited for so long. On the day of [[Ragnarök]], Brynhild will attire Sigurd for war and he shall stand deathless against the wolf [[Fenrir]] and the [[Midgard serpent]]. Although most of the [[Aesir]] gods shall die, the forces of darkness shall be struck down at Sigurd's hands. Then, under the rule of [[Baldur]], the nine worlds shall be created anew.

===The New Lay of Gudrun===
As the flames of the funeral pyre sink down and the ashes turn cold, a devastated Gudrun wanders through the forest witless. Despite loathing every moment of her life, she cannot bring herself to commit suicide.

Meanwhile, King [[Atilla the Hun|Atli]]'s [[Hunnic Empire]] grows ever stronger. Although Atli has overthrown the [[Goths]] and seized many treasures, the gold hoard of [[Fafnir]] and the beauty of Gudrun have caught his interest. Determined to claim both as his own, Atli's [[Huns]] hasten westward.

As the news reaches the Niflung court at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Gunnar asks [[Högni]] whether Atli should be met with violent resistance or appeased with [[tribute]]. Högni comments that now they have further reason to mourn the passing of Sigurd, as Atli would never have grown so bold if the serpent slayer still lived. Despite the dangers, he advises Gunnar to meet Atli on the field of battle.

[[Grimhild]], however, has another idea and counsels that Atli's friendship can be bought via Gudrun's hand in marriage. It is this advice which the Niflungs choose to take.

Gudrun they find in a forest hut where she has been weaving a [[tapestry]] which depicts the story of the gold hoard, the [[Völsung]]s, and the arrival of [[Sigurd]] into the court at Worms. Although they offer her a large payment of gold as [[weregild]] for her husband's death, Gudrun refuses to forgive her brothers or even acknowledge their presence. Only Grimhild is able to gain a response from the widow.

Grimhild advises her daughter to mourn no longer, commenting that Brynhild is dead and that Gudrun is still beautiful. She explains that King Atli wishes her hand in marriage and speaks of the great respect which the Queen of Hunland will command. Gudrun, however, is unmoved.

The widow speaks longingly of the days before Sigurd came, saying that then only nightmares vexed her. She speaks again of the dream she had before Sigurd's arrival, commenting that one half of it has already been fulfilled in Sigurd's death. Gudrun further declares that, although she now has little love for her brothers, she has no desire to see them slaughtered. Believing also that she will never again know happiness, Gudrun sees no point in remarrying.

Grimhild retorts that Gudrun should not blame her brothers. Brynhild was responsible for Sigurd's death and the Niflungs are, quite sensibly, in grief for it. Grimhild continues urging Gudrun to marry, saying that a Queen's bed is better than one cold and empty. When Gudrun angrily orders her mother to leave, Grimhild threatens to curse her daughter to unimaginable torment if she will not obey. Intimidated, Gudrun caves in to her mother's demands.

At their wedding feast, Atli blissfully drinks to Gudrun, moved both by her beauty and by dreams of the dragon hoard. After swearing oaths of kinship to the Niflungs, Atli takes Gudrun back with him to Hunland.

As the years pass, Gudrun remains unmoved, both by the glories of Hunland and by the love which Atli feels for her. Meanwhile, Atli's lust for the dragon hoard remains unquenched. At long last, he sends his herald, [[Vingi]], to summon the Niflungs to a feast in Hunland.

In response to the summons, Gunnar asks Högni whether they are vassals of Atli that they must come when he calls them. Högni is troubled, commenting that Gudrun has sent him a ring with wolf's hair woven around it. He is certain, therefore that there is a trap waiting for them in Hunland.

Gunnar, however, comments that Gudrun sent him a wooden slab graven with "[[runes]] of healing." In response, he summons for wine to be brought to the herald of Atli. As the feast continues in Gunnar's mead hall, Grimhild arrives and gives her opinion of the runic tablet.

The original runes, she says, have been shaven off the tablet but may still be read. Therefore, it is clear that the original message from Gudrun was a warning of danger. In response to his mother's advice, Gunnar informs the herald Vingi that he will not be coming to the feast in Hunland.

Laughing in amusement, Vingi responds that, as Grimhild clearly rules the Niflung kingdom, there is no need for Gunnar to come. Atli, however, had only wished for their assistance. The King of the Huns is growing old and wished for his sons by Gudrun, Erp and [[Eitill]], to have a strong protector after his death. Therefore, he had hoped that Gunnar and Högni would one day rule the [[Hunnic Empire]] in their names. Although Gunnar still suspects a trap, he agrees to come to the feast.

Although he states that he will be accompanying his brother, Högni is troubled that they aren't taking their mother's counsel. Vingi, despite knowing exactly what Atli has in mind for his in-laws, swears that the [[gallows]] shall take him and that [[common raven|raven]]s shall devour his flesh if the runes are lying.

Later, as the Niflungs depart for Hunland with Vingi, Grimhild watches as they disappear. Although silent, she is certain that she will never again look upon her sons.

After a long journey in longship and on horseback, the Niflungs arrive in Hunland and sound their horns to announce their coming. To their surprise, they find the gates barred. Vingi at last reveals the real reason for the invitation: Atli has prepared a gallows where ravens will rend the flesh of the Niflungs.

Although the lives of heralds are considered sacrosanct, Högni vows that the treacherous Vingi has forfeited his life. Dragging him to a nearby oak, the Niflungs hang Vingi within sight of the Huns.

Seething with hatred, the Huns pour forth from the mead hall's gates and hurl themselves upon the Niflungs. To Atli's surprise, Gunnar and Högni drive the Huns back inside the mead hall. With frigid loathing, Atli comes forth and refers to the Niflungs as his [[vassal]]s. He further demands Fafnir's gold hoard as the price of their lives. Gunnar, however, is unimpressed.

He vows that Atli will never receive any gold from him at all. If the King of the Huns desires the Niflungs' lives, he will pay dearly in many dead lords and warriors.

Changing tactic, Atli demands the gold as [[weregild]] for Sigurd, saying that he is entitled to it as Gudrun's husband. Gunnar, however, insists that these words are not his sister's. The lust for the gold is Atli's alone. Högni adds that, as the fighting has already begun, the time for atonement is over. Doors spring open and dozens of Hun warriors charge the Niflungs, who defend themselves until the mead hall is filled with carnage.

Meanwhile, Gudrun sits listening to the battle below and ponders that her dream has finally been fulfilled. Devastated, she curses the hour of her birth. She calls upon her husband's Gothic vassals to defend her brothers from the Hunnic "troll people."

Recalling their past wars against Atli and his Huns, the Goths turn against their lord and make common cause with the Niflungs. Högni sings of the great warriors of the past until his son Snaevar is slain before him. Unweeping, Högni continues hewing a pathway through the mead hall.

Coming at last upon Gudrun, Gunnar and Högni declare that the [[Norns]] have fated them to always give her in marriage and then slay her husband. However, Gudrun pleads with them not to tempt fate and to spare Atli's life. In response, they mock Atli as unfit for a warrior's death and grudgingly allow him to slink forth from the bloodied mead hall. As he departs in shame and anguish, the Goths and Niflungs hurl the Hunnish corpses from the roof. Meanwhile, night falls as Atli rallies warriors throughout the countryside.

Later, as the Goths and Niflungs begin nodding off to sleep, Högni notices a large column of fire moving toward the mead hall. Commenting that there are no [[dragon]]s in Hunland, Gunnar rallies his men for the final battle. Declaring that [[Valhalla]] lies open to receive them, the defenders of the mead hall succeed in holding the doorways until dawn arrives.

Five days later, the mead hall is still held by the Niflungs and Goths. Bewailing his fate, Atli declares that his power, wealth, vassals, and wife have all deserted him in the evening of his life. His counselor Beiti, however, declares that there is still another way.

Deciding to take Beiti's advice, Atli orders the mead hall built by his father to be set afire. Just before the blazing ceiling of the mead hall falls upon them, the Goths and Niflungs charge forth and are set upon by Atli's minions. Although for weapons the former have only their fists, many Hunnic necks and knees are broken before the Niflung lords are taken.

Casting his captives before Gudrun, Atli vows that he will avenge Sigurd by hurling her brothers into a pit of adders. Disgusted, Gudrun calls her husband evil and expresses hope that his death will be shameful. However, she also reminds Atli that the Niflungs are the uncles of their son Erp and Eitil. For this reason, she pleads for their lives. Atli vows that the only way he will release the Niflungs is if he is given the gold hoard that haunts his dreams.

At last relenting, Gunnar agrees to give Atli the gold, but only if his brother Högni is first slain and the heart is delivered to him. Now frantic, Gudrun pleads with Atli to spare her brother Högni. Atli, however, vows that he will have the gold despite the tears of his wife.

Atli's wise men, however, plead for caution. Fearing the queen, they persuade Atli to instead slay the [[thrall]] Hjalli. When the heart of Hjalli is delivered to him, Gunnar is unimpressed, having heard the thrall's screams. He declares that his brother's heart would never quake in such a manner. In response, the Huns visit Högni's dungeon and cut out his heart and the Niflung laughs in their faces.

Upon seeing his brother's heart, Gunnar also laughs in the faces of the Huns. The gold, he declares, is long gone, having been cast into the [[Rhine]] after Sigurd's death. Gunnar curses Atli, calling him a gold-haunted murderer. Enraged and devastated at the loss of the gold, Atli orders Gunnar to be stripped naked and cast into the pit of [[Viperidae|adders]].

As her heart hardens in hatred for her husband, Gudrun orders a harp to be sent to her brother in the pit. Smiting the strings, Gunnar chants of [[Odin]] and the [[Aesir]], of ancient kings, and the coming doom of Hunland. The whole palace listens in wonder and the snakes are stilled to sleep. At long last, an ancient adder stings Gunnar in the chest. Crying out in a loud voice, Gunnar topples over dead and the harp is stilled.

Gudrun hears the cry as she sits aghast in her bower. At last realising how to avenge her brothers, Gudrun summons her sons Erp and Eitil.

[[Viking funeral]]s are prepared for the Niflung lords and the champions of Hunland and a funeral feast is held in the remnants of Atli's palace. At long last, Gudrun appears and, presenting two goblets to her husband, she toasts his health.

As he drinks deep from the goblets, Atli feels regret over the loss of the gold. However, he also feels satisfaction that Gunnar is dead. Gudrun then announces that, in vengeance for her brothers, she has slain their sons Erp and Eitil. The goblets were made from their skulls and have been filled with a mixture of their blood and [[honey]]. The remnants of their bodies have been fed to Atli's hounds. As the mead hall explodes in horror and anguish, Atli turns pale and falls into a swoon.

As the horned moon rises, Atli is carried to his bed, as sick as one poisoned. Intending to wreak her final vengeance, Gudrun enters his chambers, wakes her husband, and drives a knife into Atli's breast.

As his life drains away, Atli snarls that Gudrun deserves to be torn apart by hounds, stoned, branded, and then [[burned at the stake]]. Laughing, Gudrun taunts him with the news that his funeral pyre has already been kindled. Within moments, a blazing inferno consumes Atli's palace and the surrounding town. The night that has proven so fatal to so many at last ends in dawn.

In the aftermath, Gudrun again wanders witless through the forest. At last, detesting her life, Gudrun casts herself into the sea, which refuses to take her.

Sitting on the edge of the sea, Gudrun ponders her woes. At long last, she calls upon Sigurd and, reminding him of their wedding vows, she implores him to return to her. Again she casts herself into the sea, wherein her grief is finally drowned.

:''"Thus glory endeth,
:''and gold fadeth,
:''on noise and clamours
:''the night falleth.
:''Lift up your hearts,
:''lords and maidens,
:''for the song of sorrow
:''that was sung of old."&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun'', page 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of composition of the two poems in ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun'', though circumstantial evidence suggests that they date from the 1930s. In his foreword, Christopher Tolkien writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"He scarely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them."&lt;ref&gt;Foreword, ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tolkien wrote in 1967, in a letter to [[W. H. Auden]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Thank you for your wonderful effort in translating and reorganizing ''[[Völuspá|The Song of the Sibyl]]''. In return, I hope to send you, if I can lay my hands on it (I hope it isn't lost), a thing I did many years ago while trying to learn the art of writing alliterative poetry: an attempt to unify the lays about the Völsungs from the [[Elder Edda]], written in the old eight-line [[fornyrðislag]] [[stanza]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien'', Letter 295, 29 March 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Commentary==
In a prefatory text, "Introduction to the ''Elder Edda''", based partly on one of his lectures, Tolkien draws a sharp distinction between [[epic poem]]s and the [[Skald]]ic and [[eddic poem|eddic]] poems of the Nordic countries: "...epic poetry never developed in those lands";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún |last1=Tolkien  |first1=J. R. R. |authorlink1=J. R. R. Tolkien |first2=Christopher|last2=Tolkien|authorlink2=Christopher Tolkien|year=2009 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York |isbn=978-0-547-27342-6|oclc=310224953 |page=20 |chapter=Introduction to the ''Elder Edda''}}&lt;/ref&gt; "verse developed its local brief, pithy, strophic, often dramatic form, not into epic, but into the astonishing and euphonious but formal elaborations of scaldic verse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún |last1=Tolkien  |first1=J. R. R. |authorlink1=J. R. R. Tolkien |first2=Christopher|last2=Tolkien|authorlink2=Christopher Tolkien|year=2009 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York |isbn=978-0-547-27342-6|oclc=310224953 |page=34|chapter=The ''Prose Edda'' of Snorri Sturluson}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also draws a distinction, although not as sharply, between the later elaborate skaldic verse and the simpler forms used in the poems of the ''[[Elder Edda]]''. The poems in ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún'' use these simpler forms, which, the book says, arose earlier but persisted alongside the skaldic forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún |last1=Tolkien  |first1=J. R. R. |authorlink1=J. R. R.

They are related growths, branches on the same tree, essentially connected, even possibly sometimes by the same hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún |last1=Tolkien  |first1=J. R. R. |authorlink1=J. R. R. Tolkien |first2=Christopher|last2=Tolkien|authorlink2=Christopher Tolkien|year=2009 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York |isbn=978-0-547-27342-6|oclc=310224953 |page=35|chapter=The ''Prose Edda'' of Snorri Sturluson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien also mentions that the use of the term "eddic" for this simpler style of verse is a later development, even an anachronism: "Thus the term 'Eddaic', as now used, in opposition to 'Skaldic,' is a perfect reversal of its former meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún |last1=Tolkien  |first1=J. R. R. |authorlink1=J. R. R. Tolkien |first2=Christopher|last2=Tolkien|authorlink2=Christopher Tolkien|year=2009 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York |isbn=978-0-547-27342-6|oclc=310224953 |page=37|chapter=The 'Prose Edda' of Snorri Sturluson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains extensive commentary by Christopher Tolkien on the sources for the two poems by his father, and the ways in which he used, mixed, and differed from those sources, as well as the larger background of legend and history behind the stories. Excerpts from notes for lectures that J. R. R. Tolkien gave on related topics are also included.

[[File:John George Brown - The Tomboy.jpg|thumb|''The Tomboy'', 1873 painting by [[John George Brown]]]]
A '''tomboy''' is a [[girl]] who exhibits [[Gender role|characteristics or behaviors]] considered typical of a [[boy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=tomboy&amp;searchmode=none Tomboy] in the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ymnp46xa0lfup1cd/ Who Are Tomboys and Why Should We Study Them?], ''[[Springer Publishing|SpringerLink]]'', ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'', Volume 31, Number 4&lt;/ref&gt; including wearing [[Masculinity|masculine]] clothing and engaging in games and activities that are physical in nature and are considered in many cultures to be [[femininity|unfeminine]] or the domain of boys.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;
==History and society==
''Tomboy'', according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), "has been connected with connotations of rudeness and impropriety" throughout its use.&lt;ref name=ELHAC/&gt; The ''OED'' dates the first use of the term to 1592,&lt;ref name=ELHAC/&gt; but an earlier use is recorded in ''[[Ralph Roister Doister]]'', which is believed to date from 1553, and was published in 1567. Author Michelle Ann Abate stated that, in nineteenth-century American culture, the usage of the word ''tomboy'' came to refer to a specific code of conduct that permitted young girls to exercise, wear "sensible clothing", and to eat a "wholesome diet". Because of the emphasis on a healthier lifestyle, tomboyism quickly grew in popularity during this time period as an alternative to the dominant feminine code of conduct that had limited women's physical movement. Abate stated that this mode of behavior was planned to enhance the power and durability of the country's coming brides and child-bearers and the progeny that they birthed. She said that tomboyism was more than a new fostering method or gender statement for the country's young women; it was also a way to improve [[Eugenics|the genetic quality of the human population]] and at least a way to assert white racial supremacy.&lt;ref name="Temple University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abate|first1=Michelle Ann|title=Tomboys: A Literary and Cultural History|date=2008|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-59213-722-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=pYdrZNd7B1sC&amp;q=exercise#v=snippet&amp;q=wholesome&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1898 book ''[[Women and Economics]]'', feminist writer [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] lauds the health benefits of being a tomboy as well as the freedom for gender exploration: "not feminine till it is time to be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilman |first1=Charlotte Perkins |title=Women and Economics |date=1898 |location=Boston |publisher=Small, Maynard &amp; Company |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94EEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Lee, a playground advocate, wrote in 1915 that the tomboy phase was crucial to physical development between the ages of eight and thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Play in Education|last = Lee|first = Joseph|publisher = |year = 1915|isbn = |location = |pages = 392–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomboyism remained popular through [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] in society, literature, and then film.

During the twentieth century, [[Freudian psychology]] and backlash against [[LGBT social movements]] resulted in societal fears about the sexualities of tomboys, and this caused some to question if tomboyism leads to [[lesbian]]ism.&lt;ref name="Temple University Press"/&gt; Throughout history, there has been a perceived correlation between tomboyishness and lesbianism.&lt;ref name=ELHAC&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Jayne Relaford|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian Histories and Cultures|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0815319207|pages=771–772|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0EUoCrFolGcC|editor=B. Zimmerman|accessdate=21 August 2012|chapter=Tomboy|quote=The word [tomboy] also has a history of sexual, even lesbian, connotations. [ ... ] The connection between tomboyism and lesbianism continued, in a more positive way, as a frequent theme in twentieth-century lesbian literature and nonfiction coming out stories.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Halberstam&gt;{{cite book|last=Halberstam|first=Judith|title=Female Masculinity|year=1998|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822322439|pages=193–196|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYAi9OEYRekC|quote=Hollywood film offers us a vision of the adult tomboy as the predatory butch dyke: in this particular category, we find some of the best and worst of Hollywood stereotyping.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Hollywood films would stereotype the adult tomboy as a "predatory butch [[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]".&lt;ref name=Halberstam/&gt; Lynne Yamaguchi and Karen Barber, editors of ''Tomboys! Tales of Dyke Derring-Do'', argue that "tomboyhood is much more than a phase for many lesbians", it "seems to remain a part of the foundation of who we are as adults".&lt;ref name=ELHAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tomboys! Tales of Dyke Derring-Do |year=1995|publisher=Alysson |location=Los Angeles |editor=Yamaguchi, Lynne and Karen Barber}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contributors to ''Tomboys!'' linked their self-identification as tomboys and lesbians to both labels positioning them outside "cultural and gender boundaries".&lt;ref name=ELHAC/&gt; Psychoanalyst Dianne Elise's essay reported that more lesbians noted being a tomboy than straight women.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Elizabeth|title=A Short History of the Tomboy|journal=The Atlantic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/01/tomboy/512258/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while some tomboys later reveal a lesbian identity in their adolescent or adult years, behavior typical of boys but displayed by girls is not a true indicator of one's [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gabriel Phillips |author2=Ray Over |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Differences between heterosexual, bisexual, and lesbian women in recalled childhood experiences |journal=[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] |year=1995 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |doi=10.1007/BF01541985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gender scholar [[Judith Halberstam]] states that while the defying of gender roles is often tolerated in young girls, [[adolescence|adolescent]] girls who display masculine traits are often repressed or punished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Halberstam|Halberstam, Judith]]: ''Female Masculinity'', Durham: Duke University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ubiquity of traditionally female clothing such as skirts and dresses has declined in the [[Western world]], where it is generally no longer considered a male trait for girls and women not to wear such clothing. An increase in the popularity of women's sporting events (see [[Title IX]]) and other activities that were traditionally male-dominated has broadened tolerance and lessened the impact of ''tomboy'' as a [[pejorative]] term.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; Instead, as sociologist [[Barrie Thorne]] suggested, some "adult women tell with a hint of pride as if to suggest: I was (and am) independent and active; I held (and hold) my own with boys and men and have earned their respect and friendship; I resisted (and continue to resist) gender stereotypes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender play: boys and girls in school|last=Thorne|first=Barrie|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=1993|isbn=0-8135-1923-3|location=|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
There have been few studies of the causality of women's behavior and interests when they do not match the female gender role. One report from the ''Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children'' suggests that preschool girls engaging in masculine-typical gender-role behavior, such as playing with toys typically preferred by boys, is influenced by genetic and prenatal factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=Melissa|author2=Golombok, Susan; Rust, John; Johnston, Katie J.; Golding, Jean; Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Study Team|title=Testosterone during Pregnancy and Gender Role Behavior of Preschool Children: A Longitudinal, Population Study|journal=Child Development|date=1 November 2002|volume=73|issue=6|pages=1678–1687|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00498|jstor=3696409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomboys have also been noted to demonstrate a stronger interest in science and technology.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18001">'''Voodoo death''', a term coined by [[Walter Cannon]] in 1942 also known as '''psychogenic death''' or '''psychosomatic death''', is the phenomenon of sudden [[death]] as brought about by a strong emotional shock, such as fear. The anomaly is recognized as "psychosomatic" in that death is caused by an emotional response—often fear—to some suggested outside force. Voodoo death is particularly noted in native societies, and [[concentration camp|concentration]]- or [[prisoner of war camps]], but the condition is not specific to any particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idStumpfe1979|Stumpfe, K.D. "The psychogenic death of Mr. J. A case report."]] pp. 263–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walter Cannon and his work==
In 1942, [[Walter Bradford Cannon]], MD, now looked to as a forerunner in modern [[physiological psychology]], published a work wherein he postulated the idea that fear could affect a person to the point that their physical condition would deteriorate in response to psychological distress.&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;[[#Reference-idCannon1942|Cannon, Walter. "Voodoo Death."]] pp. 169–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing examples of extraordinary deaths (and their extraneous circumstances) in aboriginal societies, Cannon posited the idea that fear of [[supernatural]] consequences to broken societal taboos caused the deaths witnessed in the natives.

What Cannon describes has since been termed "bone-pointing syndrome," wherein an individual receives some sort of shock—often the breaking of some social/religious taboo—that he interprets as an ill omen for himself; his physical condition then deteriorates at a rapid rate, and he dies within a period as short as 24 hours after the initial shock.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

Cannon discusses the example of a [[Māori people|Maori]] woman who learned that the fruit she had eaten came from a [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] (tabooed) place; less than 24 hours later she was dead. Conversely, Cannon also shares the example of a young man who had fallen ill when the local witch doctor had pointed a bone at him, a societal taboo that meant a curse of death; however, when the perpetrator explained to the young man that the whole thing had been a mistake, and that no bone had been pointed at him at all, the young man's health returned instantly.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

Cannon notes the similarities in each case: the individuals were both members of a society where beliefs in the supernatural are fiercely upheld, and both had suffered what they both believed to be some form of a [[curse]] as dictated within their personal beliefs; also, the individuals shared similar physical symptoms. And yet, in the case of the young man, once the cause for the psychological distress was removed, his mysterious illness disappeared. Cannon attributes these rather drastic physical repercussions as the workings of the emotion fear upon the mind which then leads to destruction of the physical condition.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

==Causes==
===Cannon's explanation===
According to Cannon, the emotion of fear working on the mind, which he terms the "sympathetic" or "sympathico-adrenal" division of the nervous system, causes a fall in blood pressure as brought on by "a reduction of the volume of circulating blood".&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt; Cannon explains the loss of blood volume by the constant injection of adrenaline into the small arterioles which constrict, preventing a proper flow of blood within the body and causing a drop in blood pressure. From there, the weak blood pressure prevents the sufficient circulation of the blood by damaging the heart and nerves responsible for the maintenance of the vessels which transport blood, thus making it harder for circulation to continue since the very organs necessary to maintain proper blood circulation are deteriorating. An accelerated heart rate then ensues, followed by rapid breathing. Added to these symptoms are the effects of no food or drink in the person experiencing psychological distress: Cannon suggests that true shock, in the medical sense, could be the cause of death as a result of little food or drink. States Cannon: "The combination of lack of food and water, anxiety, very rapid pulse and respiration, associated with a shocking experience having persistent effects, would fit well with fatal conditions reported from primitive tribes."&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

===Modern explanations===
Since 1942, scientists have discovered many more of the processes involved in the effect of stress upon the body, such as the region of the brain called the [[amygdala]]. The series of events by which a sensory stimulus is introduced to the mind, and the amygdala processes the emotion of fear which follows is called the "vision-to-fear pathway", or the "auditory-to-fear pathway", depending on the stimulus.

The generally recognized sequence of events, as enumerated by Esther M. Sternberg, MD, in 2002, stands as follows: various chemicals and electrical impulses are released that are transmitted by nerve fibers. Simultaneously, hormones are excreted from the brain, [[adrenal]] and [[pituitary glands]] in response to stress on the system. [[Cardiac arrhythmias]] are often the result of an overabundance of these hormones on the system.&lt;ref name="Esther"&gt;[[#Reference-idSternberg2002|Sternberg, Esther. "Walter B. Cannon and 'Voodoo' Death: A Perspective From 60 Years On."]] pp. 1564–1566.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Wylie Vale]], PhD, discovered [[corticotrophin]], the brain's hypothalamic stress hormone, or CRH: this hormone secreted by the [[hypothalamus]] coordinates with "the brain stem adrenaline centers involved in initiation of the sympathetic response ... to cause a massive release of both adrenaline-like nerve chemicals and stress hormones. Together these might well cause illness, including loss of appetite, weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and even vascular collapse that could result in death."&lt;ref name="Esther"/&gt;

Martin A. Samuels, MD, elaborates further on still another process of death, stating that with the release of adrenaline and an increased heart rate, sometimes [[catecholamines]], stress hormones, will build up, leading to calcium channels opening and remaining open, resulting in an overflow of calcium into the system, killing off cells.&lt;ref name="Samuels"&gt;[[#Reference-idKirn2004|Kirn, Timothy. "Voodoo death is brain's lethal response to fear."]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parasympathetic over-activation==
Cannon believed that extreme emotional stress could be explained in terms of degree of sympathetic-adrenal excitation. However, an experiment performed by Curt Richter (1957) responded to Cannon's challenge with an animal model. Richter placed pre-stressed rats in a closed turbulent water. the latency to drowning was recorded. Most domestic lab rats lasted for hours while unexpectedly all of the wild rats died within 15 minutes. Richter monitored heart rate and determined whether the heart was in systole or diastole after death. He found out that heart rate slowed down prior to death and the heart was engaged with blood reflecting a state of diastole. This contradicted Cannons proposal that sympathetic adrenal over-activation is the result of death since a sympathetic over-arousal would increase both heart rate and blood pressure to severe degrees.
Richter interpreted this that the rats died as a result of over-stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, specifically the [[vagus nerve]] which regulates heartbeat. The lethal vagal effect was the psychological state of hopelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richter | first1 = C.P. | year = 1957 | title = On the phenomenon of sudden death in animals and man | url = | journal = Psychosom. Med. | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 191–8 | doi=10.1097/00006842-195705000-00004| pmid = 13432092 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.536.1405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudden prolonged immobility or faked death is an adaptive response exhibited by many mammalian species. Hofer(1970) demonstrated that several rodent species when threatened exhibited an immobility that was accompanied by a very low heart rate. For some of the rodents that heart rate reached below 50% of the baseline. Hofer distinguished between prolonged immobility and faked death phenomenon. Unlike the behavior of "hopelessness" described by Richter, the death-faking occurred with a sudden motor collapse during active struggling. Hofer interpreted the fear-inducing slowing of heart rate as a vagal phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofer | first1 = M.A. | year = 1970 | title = Cardiac respiratory function during sudden prolonged immobility in wild rodents | url = | journal = Psychosom. Med. | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 633–47 | doi=10.1097/00006842-197011000-00008| pmid = 5530023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These data suggest that vagus contributes to severe emotional states and may be related to emotional states of immobilization, such as extreme terror. Unfortunately, this immobilization technique is potentially life-threatening for mammals (but not for reptiles). Mammals would undergo states of [[bradycardia]] or [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] as an over-activation of parasympathetic vagus system. The organs of the oxygen-hungry mammal are deprived of oxygen due to lack of blood flow, and the animal dies.

==Critical evaluation==
Despite Cannon's general ignorance on the particulars of physiological breakdown, scientists in the intervening years since the publication of Cannon's work, have generally agreed with his fundamental hypotheses concerning voodoo death. Criticisms that generally come against Cannon's work are directed at the hearsay nature of Cannon's case studies, but recent studies have discovered numerous examples of voodoo death in various societies.&lt;ref name="Lester"&gt;[[#Reference-idLester2009|Lester, David. "Voodoo Death."]] pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; To those who allege difficulty in the experimental process of validating Cannon's theory, Barbara W. Lex, in her 1974 article titled, "Voodoo Death: New Thoughts on an Old Explanation", states that "Voodoo death" can easily be observed without complicated experiments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Pupillary constriction, easily observable and indicative of parasympathetic activation ... the amount of saliva, of perspiration, degree of muscle tonicity and skin pallor in an individual are also discernible without complicated instruments."&lt;ref name="Lex"&gt;[[#Reference-idLex2009|Lex, Barbara. "Voodoo Death: New Thoughts on an Old Explanation."]] pp. 818–823.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are those who contest the theories involving psychologically-induced body failure. David Lester, PhD, in 1972, contends that Cannon's evidence, particularly the evidence concerning animals, is anecdotal and irrelevant, and instead sets forth the concept of "death by suggestion", and supports "giving up-given up" complex set forth by George L. Engel, thus attributing the cause of death entirely to the psychological state of the individual in question rather than a psychological–physiological connection adduced by Cannon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idLester1972|Lester, David. "Voodoo Death: Some New Thoughts on an Old Phenomenon."]] pp. 386–390.&lt;/ref&gt; Going even further, Harry D. Eastwell, MD in his 1982 article, "Voodoo Death and the Mechanism for Dispatch of the Dying in East Arnhem, Australia", rejects entirely the concept of "Voodoo death", stating that the deaths in cases reported by Cannon et al. were more likely due to dehydration rather than to any psychological response.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idEastwell1982|Eastwell, Harry D. "Voodoo Death and the Mechanism for Dispatch of the Dying in East Arnhem, Australia."]] pp. 5–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of this theory on modern science==
===Fight or flight===
Deeply related to these cases of sudden death is what Cannon termed the "[[fight-or-flight response]]", what has been classified as a "neurophysiological-behavioral" response pattern. "Fight or flight" is a phrase used to describe the instinctual and physiological responses to strong emotion within animals as well as humans. Cannon associates the two emotions of rage and fear because of the similar effects the emotions will have upon the mind and body—rage will encourage the response to "fight", while fear will encourage "flight". The mind, when faced with one or both of these emotions in response to a perceived threat, will emit adrenaline, and heart rate will increase; however, sometimes the system is overwhelmed by the responses, and collapse ensues as brought about by the workings of stress hormones.&lt;ref name= "Samuels"/&gt;

In the case of voodoo death, the "flight" response overpowers the system, but there is little to no possibility for action in the mind of the individual suffering from the perceived threat—considering the state of aboriginal tribes, the victims believe themselves to be suffering from a curse in which they are condemned to die, and so they believe themselves to be unable to act to save themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGomez1982|Gomez, E.A. "Voodoo and sudden death: the effects of expectations on health."]] pp. 75–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New fields===
Cannon's theory concerning voodoo death opened research into various fields of psychological studies; since the publication of Cannon's work, scientists have discovered many disorders and the like related to psychosomatic responses to situations. Because of Cannon's postulation that the mind could bring about death, scientists have become open to the idea of the mind working on the body in a greater number of ways, leading to the development of [[psychosomatic medicine]].&lt;ref name="names"&gt;[[#Reference-idLane2009|Lane, R.D., Waldstein, S.R., Chesney, M.A, et al. "The Rebirth of Neuroscience in Psychosomatic Medicine, Part I: Historical Context, Methods, and Relevant Basic Science."]] pp. 117–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of theories concerning voodoo death within the scientific field has also led to the development of a branch of psychology termed [[psychophysiology]].&lt;ref name="names"/&gt;

==Notable cases==
Though cases within aboriginal societies are the most commonly cited when researchers such as Cannon set forth examples, similar cases of psychosomatic death have also been reported in other cultures.

In his 1964 article, James L. Mathis, MD, describes a case of a previously healthy man who died from asthmatic attacks when his mother "cursed" him for going against her wishes. Mathis proposes that "fatal psychosomatic conditions" were the cause of this man's death, and thus a form of voodoo death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idMathis1964|Mathis, James L. "Sophisticated Version of Voodoo Death."]] pp. 104–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scientist—Clifton K. Meador, MD—in 1992 discussed the case of a man diagnosed with cancer who, along with his physicians and family, believed he was dying of cancer. In the autopsy after his death, however, the doctors discovered that his cancer was not at all the cause of his death. Meador deduces that the man's belief in his imminent death was the cause of his death itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1546347 | volume=85 | issue=3 | title=Hex death: voodoo magic or persuasion? | journal=South Med J | pages=244–7 | last1 = Meador | first1 = CK | doi=10.1097/00007611-199203000-00004| year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
