Protests began the night of 12 June 2009, following the announcement that incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won nearly 63% of the vote, despite several reported irregularities.  However, all three opposition candidates claimed the votes were manipulated and the election was rigged, with Rezaee and Mousavi lodging official complaints. Mousavi announced he "won't surrender to this manipulation", before lodging an official appeal against the result to the [[Guardian Council]] on [[Timeline of the 2009 Iranian election protests#June|14 June]].&lt;ref name=join/&gt; Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] ordered an investigation into the claims of electoral fraud and irregularities, as requested by Green Movement leaders.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{Cite news|title=Election Battles Turn Into Street Fights in Iran |publisher=[[ABC News]] |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7830630 |date=13 June 2009 |accessdate=13 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibzFCQPv?url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7830630 |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnsonMurphy"&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Anna Johnson |author2=Brian Murphy |title=Iranian protester killed after opposition rally |date=15 June 2009 |agency=Associated Press |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090615/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_election |accessdate=20 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618115353/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090615/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_election |archivedate=18 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chinaview"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Iran's supreme leader orders investigation into claims of vote fraud |date=15 June 2009 |work=China View |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/15/content_11546228.htm |accessdate=18 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibzHnLho?url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/15/content_11546228.htm |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadinejad called the election "completely free" and the outcome a "great victory" for Iran, dismissing the protests as akin to little more than "passions after a soccer match".&lt;ref name=join1&gt;{{Cite news|date=14 June 2009|accessdate=23 June 2009|title=Iranian leader: Fiery clashes over election 'not important'|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-06-13-iran-vote-saturday_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Prior to 2005===
{{main|History of the Islamic Republic of Iran}}
{{See also|Politics of Iran|Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|Iranian reform movement}}
Since 1980 following the [[Iranian Revolution|collapse of the Shah's regime in 1979]]. The government is based on the concept of [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|Velayat-e Faqih]], which is a system of governance in which a ''faqih'' was to serve as the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]. However, following calls that this idea was undemocratic, the system was moderately altered into the current "Islamic Republic", in which a [[Assembly of Experts|council of clerics]], who are elected by the people, choose the Supreme Leader who, per the constitution, has to be a cleric (though this was altered in 1988). The Supreme Leader, in turn appoints the members of the twelve member [[Guardian Council]], who approve laws and candidates for elections, even at the presidential level. The President of Iran is not the commander-in-chief, and the control of the military, police, and the parallel [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] is under the control of the Supreme Leader. The Revolutionary Guards is a constitutionally protected paramilitary force that operates alongside the regular Armed forces, whose primary function is to protect the Islamic Republic. The Revolutionary Guards also have an auxiliary wing called the [[Basij]], who provide support in enforcing religious laws and suppressing dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', W.W. Norton, (2005), p.88, 316–318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/world/middleeast/19basij.html?_r=1&amp;ref=global-home |title=Shadowy Iranian Vigilantes Vow Bolder Action |work=New York Times |author=Neil MacFarquhar |accessdate=19 June 2009 |date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not considered full members of the Revolutionary Guards, and lack the training given to full-time members, although they can be called up at any time to assist the regular forces in times of trouble. Though Ayatollah Khomeini and his successor Ayatollah Khamenei, claimed that this system was democratic and the Revolutionary guards are necessitated to protect the government from military coups and foreign interference, critics contend that this system only serves to keep like-minded conservatives in power and marginalize any opposition, while using the Revolutionary guards to silence any dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146308224 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=8 October 2006 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146308301 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146307117 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=7 September 2005 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/media.asp?id=10588595 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Media - Articles |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date= |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=1779650752 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=11 January 2004 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic Republic has not escaped popular opposition in the past. During the 1980s, the Marxist-Islamist, [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mojahedin Khalq]] was instrumental in opposing Ayatollah Khomeini through large protests and bombings against politicians such as [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]], [[Shahid Beheshti]], and Khamenei himself, who escaped an assassination attempt that left his right arm paralyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/islam/countries/bl_IranRevolutionTerror.htm |title=Religion in Iran - Terror and Repression |publisher=Atheism.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily News - June 1981"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id112.htm |title=The Daily News - June 1981 |publisher=Eightiesclub.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=72375 |title=Iran ABC News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=1981-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1981 [[Hafte Tir bombing]], Ayatollah Khomeini declared the Mojahedin and anyone opposed to the Islamic republic, "enemies of god" and pursued a mass campaign of torture, rape, and execution against members of the Mojahedin, [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian (Majority)|Fadaiyan]], and [[Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh]] parties as well as their families, close friends, and even anyone who was accused of insufficient Islamic behavior, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Iranians who were usually tried in secret kangaroo courts run by hard line clerics.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.243&lt;/ref&gt; Following the failed [[Operation Mersad]] in 1988, Khomeini [[1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners|ordered all prisons to execute those still in captivity]], resulting in an estimated 30,000 dead. Since then, no organized opposition has surfaced in Iran and following this experience, the Iranian Government usually employs heavy handed tactics to marginalize any attempt at regime removal and usually justifies this with the "enemy of god" classification.

In 1997, following the unexpected victory of a little-known reformist cleric [[Mohammad Khatami]], there was a revival of a moderate faction within the government whom the public believed had the ability to reform and curb the power of the conservatives and make the system somewhat democratic, and that Khamenei was willing to trust this faction in the hopes that it could recover the country after the eight-year war with Iraq, which Rafsanjani and the conservatives had failed to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1373476.stm |title=BBC News, 6 June 2001 Profile: Mohammad Khatami |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-06-06 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than promoting a reform of the system, the reformists began questioning the concept of the Islamic republic itself and following the exposure of the [[Chain Murders of Iran|murders of dissidents by the intelligence services]] in reformist newspapers (which were run by former Revolutionary Guards and intelligence agents now turned reformists), the government began to distrust Khatami and his faction, a conflict which reached the breaking point after the 1999 [[Iran student protests, July 1999|student protests]], after which hardliners such as [[Mohammad Ali Jafari]], [[Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf]], and [[Qasem Soleimani]] were promoted to take control of the Revolutionary Guards and the Security Services to crack down on most reformist movements. Despite reformists gaining a majority in the Majlis in 2000 and Khatami winning the 2001 election as well, Khamenei would oppose any attempts at liberalization of the government or society.&lt;ref&gt;"Men of principle", ''The Economist''. London: 21 July 2007. Vol. 384, Iss. 8538; pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Most Iranians and observers in general have regarded the reform movement to have been a failure with [[Saeed Hajjarian]], the main theorist behind the movement, declaring in 2003 that "the reform movement is dead. Long live the reform movement".&lt;ref&gt;اصلاحات مرد زنده باد اصلاحات&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadinejad's first term===
{{main|Government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005–13)}}
In 2005, Tehran Mayor [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was elected to the presidency, defeating now reformist [[Ali-Akbar Rafsanjani]], placing the conservatives in charge of the government once more. Ahmadinejad would focus his presidency on confronting Israel. His speeches gained international infamy, which usually called for the destruction of Israel and claimed that the [[Holocaust]] was fabricated. The funding of anti-Israeli groups went up exponentially, particularly towards [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]], which have been labeled as Terrorist groups by the United States. Despite Iran's huge oil and gas reserves, those sectors have been relatively neglected in favor of a nuclear energy program that has cost billions of dollars and has been condemned by Israel and the United States, who claim that the program is a cover up for a much larger nuclear weapons program. As a result, the United Nations has placed sanctions on the Iranian government, which has had a heavy impact on the economy, reducing the value of the rial from a low of 8,000 to the dollar in 2005 to 10,000 to the dollar in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=7 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203093100/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |archivedate=3 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran has been experiencing high birth rates since 1988, both due to an increase in standard of living and government encouragement of large families, with an estimated 60 percent of the country being under the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uesco.org/education/wef/countryreports/iran/rapport_2.html Country Reports - Iran]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

===The election===
The [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|election of the president of Iran in 2009]] was preceded by [[Iran 2009 election#Opinion polls|many Iranian surveys]] and a survey by the US-based Terror Free Tomorrow organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/ |title=Terror Free Tomorrow |accessdate=18 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jc8EoPnz?url=http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/ |archivedate=7 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Terror Free Tomorrow opinion poll, conducted from 11 to 20 May 2009, predicted the high participation and showed similar ratios for the candidates to the later official result, with over a quarter yet undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahmadinejad Front Runner in Upcoming Presidential Elections; Iranians Continue to Back Compromise and Better Relations with US and West.

The election for presidency took place on 12 June 2009. Unlike the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|election in 2005]], the 2009 election featured high participation. The results of the elections were announced only 2 hours after the end of the votes, which may seem impossible. The [[Iran 2009 election#Result|official results]] were rejected by all three opposition candidates, who claimed that the votes were manipulated and the election was rigged. The last presidential election had already been [[Iranian presidential election, 2005#Election controversies|controversial]], but this time it escalated. Candidates [[Mohsen Rezaee]] and Mousavi have lodged official complaints. Mousavi announced that he "won't surrender to this manipulation" before lodging an official appeal against the result to the [[Guardian Council]] on 14 June.&lt;ref name=join/&gt;

According to an analysis by Professor Walter R. Mebane, Jr. from the Department of Statistics of the [[University of Michigan]], considering data from the first stage of the 2005 presidential election produces results that "give moderately strong support for a diagnosis that the 2009 election was affected by significant fraud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mebane|first=Walter R.|title=Note on the presidential election in Iran, June 2009|date=18 June 2009|format=PDF|url=http://www.umich.edu/~wmebane/note18jun2009.pdf| accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK-based think-tank Chatham House also suspected fraud in the voting process for a number of reasons:&lt;ref name="chatham"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Analysis of the Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Election|url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Research/Middle%20East/iranelection0609.pdf|date=26 June 2011|author1=Ali Ansari|author2=Daniel Berman|author3=Thomas Rintoul|publisher=Chatham House and the Institute of Iranian Studies, University of St Andrews|accessdate=21 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005142556/http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Research/Middle%20East/iranelection0609.pdf|archive-date=5 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| More than 100%
|In two Conservative provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, a turnout of ''more than 100%'' was recorded.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;
|-
| No swing
|At a provincial level, there is no correlation between the increased turnout, and the swing to Ahmadinejad.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt; This challenges the notion that his victory was due to the massive participation of a previously silent Conservative majority.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;
|-
| Reformist votes
|In a third of all provinces, the official results would require that Ahmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters, and all former centrist voters, and all new voters, but ''also took up to 44% of former Reformist voters'', despite a decade of conflict between these two groups.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;

|In 2005, as in 2001 and 1997, conservative candidates, and Ahmadinejad in particular, were markedly unpopular in rural areas. The claim that this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provinces in 2009 flies in the face of these trends.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;

{{Main|Timeline of the 2009 Iranian election protests|Results of the Iranian presidential election, 2009}}

On Saturday 13 June after election results announced that Ahmadinejad had won, supporters of Mousavi took to the streets to protest. The next day, protests grew, as did violence. On the night of 14 June the pro-Ahmadinejad [[Basij]] paramilitary group raided Tehran University, injuring many. On 15 June millions of protesters marched on Azadi street and Mousavi made his first post-election appearance.

On 16 June, protests continued, and the [[Guardian Council]] announced a partial recount would be conducted; however, the vote was not annulled. On Wednesday 17 June another large protest occurred; some members of the [[Iranian national football team]] wore green wristbands in support of Mousavi during their game against South Korea. On Thursday, 18 June more than 100,000 protesters held a candlelight vigil in Tehran following Mousavi's call for a day of mourning for those killed in protests. The Guardian Council invited the three major challengers to meet to discuss their grievances.

On Friday, 19 June, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini spoke during religious services, saying the election was legitimate and called the large voter turnout and resulting victory (for Ahmadinejad) a "divine assessment" and that protests would no longer be tolerated. However, the opposition did not accept this and the protests occurred, albeit on a smaller scale. The next day, 20 June, fewer protesters took to streets. At the protests that did occur, said to number in the tens of thousands of people, much violence occurred, causing many would-be protesters to stay in their homes the next day, Sunday, 21 June. On 20 June, a young Iranian woman, identified as [[Neda Agha-Soltan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=French |publisher=egoblog.net |title=Her name was Neda |url=http://egoblog.net/2009/06/21/her-name-was-neda/ |accessdate=21 June 2009 |date=21 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibz2nxSW?url=http://egoblog.net/2009/06/21/her-name-was-neda/ |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shot and died in front of cameras on Kargar Avenue in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=BreakForNews.com |title=Unidentified Woman Shot Dead in Karegar Ave – 20 June 2009 |url=http://breakfornews.com/KarekarAveShooting090620.htm |accessdate=20 June 2009 |date=20 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibz44O18?url=http://breakfornews.com/KarekarAveShooting090620.htm |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly graphic amateur videos of the killing rapidly spread [[Viral video|viral]] across the Internet after being posted to Facebook and YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Youtube|title=Basij shots to a young woman in Tehran's Saturday 20 June protests |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=185vPe_gROA |accessdate =20 June 2009|date=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June, riot police broke up the main rally in Tehran with tear gas and live fire into the air.

During Friday, 26 June, prayers were broadcast live on television, and [[Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami]] is reported to have said that "Anybody who fights against the Islamic system or the leader of Islamic society, fight him until complete destruction" and called for the execution of leading demonstrators as they are "people who wage war against God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6583797.ece |accessdate=27 June 2009 |location=London |work=The Times |first=Martin |last=Fletcher |title=Leading demonstrators must be executed Ayatollah Khatami demands |date=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, 29 June, the Guardian Council certified the results of the controversial election.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran Council Certifies Disputed Election Results|author=Michael Slackman|date=29 June 2009|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set off a wave of protests, disregarding the Iranian government's ban on street marches.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; The Iranian intelligence chief alleged that western and "Zionist" forces were responsible for inciting the protests. Four of the nine British officials arrested on 28 June 2009 remain in custody under those charges.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

Late July, protest had reportedly entered a "Phase II", using tactics such as the boycott of goods advertised on state-controlled television; attempting to deny power to state-run TV evening news broadcasts by turning on all electric appliances just before the news; "blitz" street demonstrations "lasting just long enough to chant `Death to the dictator!` several times", but not long enough for security forces to arrive; identifying paramilitary [[Basij]] vigilantes linked to the crackdown and putting marks in the opposition color green, or pictures of protest victims in front of their homes; scribbled anti-regime slogans on money. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The new protest is reportedly based on the idea of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] that "even the most powerful cannot rule without the cooperation of the ruled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1912941,00.html?xid=rss-world |work=Time |first=Robin |last=Wright |title=Iran's Protesters: Phase 2 of Their Feisty Campaign |date=27 July 2009|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term as President of Iran in an official inauguration in Tehran. Protests were held outside the Parliament during the inauguration, with protesters chanting "death to the dictator".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/world/52524657.html|title=Ahmadinejad sworn in as Iran president amid crisis|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=5 August 2009}}{{Dead link|date=August 2009|bot=WebCiteBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major protests would continue after the inauguration as well.

While the [[Death of Neda Agha-Soltan|death of Neda]] attracted widespread media attention, ''The Guardian'' is also maintaining a list of numerous other people who have ostensibly been either killed or arrested since the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Iran election: faces of the dead and detained |accessdate=5 July 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2009/jun/29/iran-election-dead-detained |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=29 June 2009 |first=Simon |last=Jeffery |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724091446/http://www.guardian.co.uk//world//interactive//2009//jun//29//iran-election-dead-detained|archivedate=24 July 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has issued very little official information on who has been killed or arrested (except Neda Agha-Soltan, whose video circulated quickly on the Internet). Hospitals were prohibited from registering the dead bodies or injured people, as a medical student at Rasoul-Akram hospital witnessed on the night of 15 June: "Nine people died at our hospital and another 28 had gunshot wounds...

The families of those who died were allegedly subjected to penalties and bureaucratic [[red tape]], such as being asked to sign paperwork that they do not have complaints against the government prior to being allowed to claim bodies. When the death was due to gunshot wounds, some were reportedly asked to pay a $3,000 fee, ostensibly for the bullet used by security forces.&lt;ref name="wsjalipour"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124571865270639351 |title=Son's Death Has Iranian Family Asking Why|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=23 June 2009 |first=Farnaz |last=Fassihi|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126194701/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124571865270639351.html|archivedate=26 January 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on burial locations have also been reported,&lt;ref name="wsjalipour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="makanbbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8113552.stm|title=Death video woman 'targeted by militia'|publisher=BBC News|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iranian government did not permit a memorial service for Neda Agha-Soltan.&lt;ref name="makanbbc"/&gt; [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] speculates that the [[Arba'een|Shi'ite cycle of mourning]] on the third (23 June), seventh (27 June), and 40th (30 July) day after a person's death may give the protests sustained momentum, similar in fashion to what occurred during the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Iranian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wright |first=Robin |title=In Iran, one woman's death may have many consequences |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=23 June 2009 |date=21 June 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1906049,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622174825/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1906049%2C00.html |archivedate=22 June 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Torture of prisoners====
Opposition leaders have claimed that the prisoners have been tortured and raped in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090812/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_23|title=Pro-reform party blames Iran's president for abuse|accessdate=13 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition leaders and world leaders condemned the abuse.

Former chairman of Iranian parliament [[Mehdi Karroubi]] stated that male and female prisoners have been raped in the prison and their genitals were torn, but it is not yet proven. He asked the head of the assembly to investigate the issue in a letter to the head of [[Assembly of Experts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1494473.php/Opposition-party-leader-claims-sexual-abuse-in-Iranian-prisons |title=Opposition party leader claims sexual abuse in Iranian prisons |accessdate=9 August 2009 |author1=James Wray |author2=Ulf Stabe |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j5ISFK5N?url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1494473.php/Opposition-party-leader-claims-sexual-abuse-in-Iranian-prisons |archivedate=17 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's police chief, Gen.

Additionally, several of the detained died while in prison. Authorities claimed that the deaths were caused by "pre-existing conditions". However, examinations of the bodies showed signs of torture, including broken bones, finger nails torn off, and rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090812/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_23|title=Pro-reform party blames Iran's president for abuse|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=13 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theaustralian&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26093533-2703,00.html|title=Ahmadinejad's Basiji run a regime of rape, murder to suppress critics|work=The Australian|accessdate=4 October 2009 |first1=Martin |last1=Fletcher |date=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian film maker [[Reza Allamehzadeh]] made a documentary about Azar Al-Kanan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Azar Ale-Kanan &amp;#124; Iranian.com |url=http://iranian.com/main/2009/aug/azar-ale-kanan |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j6930NAT?url=http://iranian.com/main/2009/aug/azar-ale-kanan |archivedate=17 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=16 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent Iranian human rights activist and former political prisoner in Iran who became one of the victims of torture, sexual abuse, and finally, rape. The documentary was released after ex-chairman of Iranian parliament Mehdi Karroubi called for investigation of sexual abuse of protesters in prisons by Iranian police and the judicial system, both under the responsibility of the Supreme Leader. Karroubi's letter angered conservatives and the head of Iranian parliament, [[Ali Larijani]], and senior cleric and representative of the Supreme Leader, [[Ahmad Khatami]], denied the reports of sexual abuse. Following the denials, on 16 August 2009, [[Fereshteh Ghazi]], in an article in [[Rooz]], wrote her story and described the torture and sexual violence in Iranian prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=تکان دهنده تر از دروغ – roozonline.com |url=http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article////107/-1738c4bd99.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jD3gG533?url=http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article////107/-1738c4bd99.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=16 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June, Belgian national television reporter Jef Lambrecht from the [[Flanders|Flemish]] public television broadcaster [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]] and his sound technician, Vandervorst, were arrested in Tehran. They had been doing a story on the riots and had gotten caught in the middle of the violence. While Lambrecht had taken a punch, Vandervorst was arrested by riot police. When Lambrecht went to check where Vandervorst was being taken, he was promptly arrested as well. Both were taken to the Ministry of Information and detained in the basement. They were both released after two hours with strict instructions not to make any photos or film recordings of the protests. At the same time, two Dutch reporters from Nova were also arrested and deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VRT-reporter opgepakt in woelig Teheran |url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=LO2BDPIV |language=Dutch |date=15 June 2009 |work=[[Het Nieuwsblad]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ic2uaN8l?url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=LO2BDPIV |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This directly appeals to the notion of injustice and redemption at the heart of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{Cite news|title=Demanding to be counted |url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13856232 |work=The Economist |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ic2vgQmU?url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13856232 |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 July 2009 |date=18 June 2009 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, were [[Irreligion in Iran|irreligious]] in their protests.

For Iran, one of the links of communication exist solely because of the ideology the revolutionary movement was based upon Islamism (Poursaied, p.&amp;nbsp;136). The religious institutions were used to communicate from one revolutionary group to another. These institutions consist of "mosques, ritual centres, and even charity funds,&lt;ref&gt;Poursaeid Farzad, “Democracy Promotion, Authoritarian Resiliency, and Political Unrest in Iran", ''Discourse: An Iranian Quarterly'', Volume 10 (Winter/Spring 2012):119–143.&lt;/ref&gt; and these venues allowed people to gather right under the nose of the government in order to become organised.

Protesters have deliberately dressed modestly. The marches in Tehran saw women in [[chador]]s and turbaned clerics,&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; some of whom were seen thronging Mousavi's car during the 15 June rally at Revolution Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gunfire, euphoria: week that shook Iran|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iIZfBKxzXFlFYz1AGvhnIVr27tXwD98UIHVO1|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anna Johnson of Associated Press, conservative women in black chadors have joined the liberal youth for the common goal of trying to get their voices heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Anna Johnson|title=Families, women in chadors join Iran's opposition|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hWoxNISdzCH6A5mt0n0coCRzxg-QD98SQ4Q03|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] reported that some protesters believed they had a religious duty to protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Forbidden Iran: How to Report When You're Banned|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1906069,00.html|author=Nahid Siamdoust|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Neda Agha-Soltan.jpg|thumb|[[Neda Soltan]], a woman killed by [[Basij]] on 20 June]] --&gt;
A bystander, [[Neda Agha-Soltan]], who was killed by authorities, has been mythologised by the opposition as a [[Shahid|martyr]]. The status of a martyr is revered in Shia Islam. To prevent this from happening, the authorities have tried to call off [[janaza|funeral services]] for her, which according to Shia Islam, must be held on the third, seventh, and 40th day after the martyr's passing. Robert Tait and Matthew Weaver of ''The Guardian'' noted that it was [[funeral procession]]s on the 40th day of [[mourning]] of fallen protesters in 1979 that created momentum in toppling the [[Pahlavi dynasty|shah's regime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How Neda Soltani became the face of Iran's struggle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/22/neda-soltani-death-iran|author1=Robert Tait |author2=Matthew Weaver |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of martyrdom resonates deeply amongst the Shiite Muslim population of Iran.

[[Image:Bin.JPG|thumb|150px|The bin bugs can only be attached to wheelie bins, which not all British households currently possess.]]
The term "'''bin bug'''" was coined in August 2006 by the [[Media of the United Kingdom|British media]] to refer to the use of [[Radio Frequency Identification]] (RFID) chips by some local councils to monitor the amount of [[municipal solid waste|domestic waste]] created by each household. The system works by having a unique RFID chip for each household's non-recycling [[wheelie bin]] (such households have two bins: one for general waste and one [[recycling]] bin).  The chip is scanned by the [[waste collection vehicle|dustbin lorry]] and, as it lifts the bin, records the weight of the contents.  This is then stored in a central [[database]] that monitors the non-recycled waste output of each household.&lt;ref name="thisislondon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirror.co.uk.  28 August 2006.  [https://www.mirror.co.uk/new s/tm_objectid=17638188&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=how-the-bin-bug-works--name_page.html How the bin bug works]".  Accessed 1 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in England==
If the pilot schemes are successful it is expected that most British cities will introduce the system in the next two years.&lt;ref name="thisislondon"&gt;thisislondon.co.uk.  26 August 2006.  "[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23364736-details/Spy%20in%20your%20wheelie%20bin/article.do Germans plant bugs in our wheelie bins] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116215432/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23364736-details/Spy%20in%20your%20wheelie%20bin/article.do |date=November 16, 2006 }}".  Accessed 1 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCbugged"&gt;[[BBC News]].  27 August 2006.  "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5291222.stm Bugged bins to promote recycling]".  Accessed 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Three local councils in England and five [[Ulster]] councils have been trialling the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;McBride, Sam.  ''Belfast Telegraph''.  "[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/story.jsp?story=704289 Secret chip that checks what you put in your bin]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}".  Accessed 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
While some councils informed the householders of their intentions to monitor their waste output many others did not.&lt;ref name="thisislondon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennet"&gt;28 August 2006.  "[http://www.anenglishmanscastle.com/archives/003093.html Kennet Bin Bug Secrecy — Council leader "not told of true purpose"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323201604/http://www.anenglishmanscastle.com/archives/003093.html |date=March 23, 2007 }}".  Accessed 1 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Worcester]] City Council, for example, detailed their plans through local newspaper ''Worcester News'' in August 2005.&lt;ref name="Berrow"&gt;31 August 2006.  ''[[Berrow's Worcester Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aberdeen City]] Council kept the scheme quiet until a local newspaper ran the story; the council declared no intention to operate or bring the system online but did not rule out future use.&lt;ref name="thisisnorthscotland"&gt;31 August 2006 {{cite web |url=http://www.thisisnorthscotland.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=149235&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=149218&amp;contentPK=15298408 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117110905/http://www.thisisnorthscotland.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=149235&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=149218&amp;contentPK=15298408 |archivedate=2016-01-17 |df= }} Outrage over secret bugs in rubbish bins Accessed 31 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some councillors said that the purpose of the "bin bugs" was to settle disputes about the ownership of the bins, but others mentioned that the system is a trial and means that they are more prepared should the government introduce a household waste tax.  The tax would be in the form of a charge for households that exceed set limits of non-recycled waste.&lt;ref name="thisislondon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leyden, John.  ''[[The Register]]''.  29 August 2006.  "[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/29/bin_brother/ Wheelie bin bugging foreshadows 'rubbish tax']".  Accessed 1 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  With recycling in the UK amongst the lowest percentage in Europe at 18%, a new tax scheme would have the intention of encouraging domestic recycling and meeting European landfill reduction targets.&lt;ref name="BBCbugged" /&gt;

Each RFID chip costs around £2, with each scanning system costing around £15,000.  The [[Local Government Association]] (LGA) provided £5 million to councils to fund 40 pilot schemes.&lt;ref name="BBCbugged" /&gt;  They are supplied by two rival [[Germany|German]] companies: Sulo and [[Deister Electronic]].&lt;ref name="thisislondon" /&gt;  Some suggest that people who removed the chip might not have their bin emptied.&lt;ref name="Kennet" /&gt;

==European Directives==
The motivation behind the RFID chips are to monitor the production of landfill waste so that councils can comply with the European Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100953/http://www.binbugs.com/directive.htm]"
The standard regulating RFID tags for the waste industry is EN 14803 Identification and/or determination of the quantity of waste.

==Removing the bug==
The [[RFID]] tag is located in a recess under the front lip of the bin, either as a self-contained unit or behind a plastic cap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/regions/sheffield/2006/08/349168.html Is your bin bugged?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dushka.co.uk/blog/index.php?id=26 Removing the Bin Bug] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927042811/http://www.dushka.co.uk/blog/index.php?id=26 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dushka.co.uk/blog/?id=58 Another day...] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927042817/http://www.dushka.co.uk/blog/?id=58 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some debate as to the legality of removing the RFID chip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starttherevolution.org/archives/2006/i%20-%20september/TheGreatBinBugRevolt.htm The Great Bin Bug Revolt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928184541/http://www.starttherevolution.org/archives/2006/i%20-%20september/TheGreatBinBugRevolt.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carboxymethyl cellulose''' ('''CMC''') or '''cellulose gum'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/gsfaonline/additives/details.html?id=51 |author=Codex Alimentarius Commission |title=Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Cellulose gum) |year=2016 |work=GFSA Online |publisher=FAO}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''tylose powder'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prettywittycakes.co.uk/blog/what-difference-between-gum-tragacanth-cmc-and-tylose |title=What is the difference between Gum Tragacanth, CMC and Tylose? |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[cellulose]] [[derivatization|derivative]] with carboxymethyl groups (-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-COOH) bound to some of the [[hydroxyl]] groups of the [[glucose|glucopyranose]] [[monomer]]s that make up the cellulose [[polymer|backbone]]. It is often used as its [[Sodium salts|sodium salt]], sodium carboxymethyl cellulose.

==Preparation==
It is [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] by the [[alkali]]-[[catalyst|catalyzed]] [[chemical reaction|reaction]] of cellulose with [[chloroacetic acid]].&lt;ref name="Hollabaugh1945"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hollabaugh |first1=C.B. |last2=Burt |first2=Leland H. |last3=Walsh |first3=Anna Peterson |date=October 1945 |title=Carboxymethylcellulose... Uses and Applications |url= |journal=Industrial and Engineering Chemistry |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=943–947 |doi=10.1021/ie50430a015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[polar molecule|polar]] (organic [[acid]]) [[carboxyl group]]s render the cellulose [[soluble]] and chemically reactive.

Following the initial reaction, the resultant mixture produces about 60% CMC plus 40% salts ([[sodium chloride]] and [[sodium glycolate]]). This product is the so-called technical CMC which is used in [[detergents]]. A further purification process is used to remove these salts to produce the pure CMC used for food, pharmaceutical, and dentifrice (toothpaste) applications. An intermediate "semipurified" grade is also produced, typically used in paper applications such as restoration of archival documents.

The functional properties of CMC depend on the degree of [[substitution (chemistry)|substitution]] of the cellulose structure (i.e., how many of the hydroxyl groups have taken part in the substitution reaction), as well as the chain length of the cellulose backbone structure and the degree of clustering of the carboxymethyl substituents.

==Uses==

CMC is used in [[Food science|food]] under the   [[E number]] E466 or E469 (when it is [[enzymatically hydrolyzed]]) as a [[viscosity]] modifier or [[thickener]], and to [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilize]] [[emulsion]]s in various products including [[ice cream]]. It is also a constituent of many non-food products, such as [[toothpaste]], [[laxative]]s, [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] pills,  [[water]]-based [[paint]]s, [[detergent]]s, textile [[sizing#Textile warp sizing|sizing]], reusable [[Ice pack|heat packs,]] and various [[paper]] products. It is used primarily because it has high [[viscosity]], is nontoxic, and is generally considered to be [[hypoallergenic]] as the major source fiber is either softwood pulp or [[cotton linter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CP Kelco Cellulose Gum / Carboxymethyl Cellulose|url=http://www.cpkelco.com/products-cellulose-gum.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose -  The Ideal Hydrocolloid for Bakery &amp; Dough Products |url=http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_0163/0901b803801632c7.pdf?filepath=/194-01430.pdf&amp;fromPage=GetDoc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626142113/http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_0163/0901b803801632c7.pdf?filepath=%2F194-01430.pdf&amp;fromPage=GetDoc |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CMC is used extensively in gluten free and reduced fat food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodhealthinnovation.com/media/4041/food_processing_technologies_for_reduction_of_fat_in_products_final.pdf |title=Food Processing Technologies for Reduction of Fat in Products |last=Stanford |first=John |date=January 2012 |website=Food &amp; Health Innovation Service |publisher=Scotland Food &amp; Drink |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023145749/http://www.foodhealthinnovation.com/media/4041/food_processing_technologies_for_reduction_of_fat_in_products_final.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In laundry detergents, it is used as a soil suspension polymer designed to deposit onto cotton and other cellulosic fabrics, creating a negatively charged barrier to soils in the wash solution. CMC is used as a [[lubricant]] in [[artificial tears]].

CMC is also used as a thickening agent, for example, in the oil-drilling industry as an ingredient of [[drilling fluid|drilling mud]], where it acts as a viscosity modifier and water retention agent.

Knitted fabric made of cellulose (e.g. cotton or viscose rayon) may be converted into CMC and used in various medical applications.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The device is soaked in water to form a gel, this is inserted into the nose and the balloon inflated. The combination of the inflated balloon and the therapeutic effect of the CMC stops the bleeding. (See "Rapid Rhino")

Insoluble microgranular CMC is used as a cation-exchange resin in [[ion-exchange chromatography]] for purification of proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatman.com/CationExchangeCelluloses.aspx|title=Whatman Filters &amp; Sample Collection|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, the level of derivatization is much lower, so the solubility properties of microgranular cellulose are retained, while adding sufficient negatively charged carboxylate groups to bind to positively charged proteins.

CMC is also used in [[ice pack]]s to form a [[Eutectic system|eutectic mixture]] resulting in [[Freezing point depression|a lower freezing point]], and therefore more cooling capacity than ice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coldchaintech.com/faqs-refrigerants.php Use in ice packs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174610/http://www.coldchaintech.com/faqs-refrigerants.php |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aqueous solutions of CMC have also been used to disperse carbon nanotubes.  The long CMC molecules are thought to wrap around the nanotubes, allowing them to be dispersed in water. In conservation-restoration, it is used as an adhesive or fixative (commercial name Klucel).

CMC is used to achieve [[tartrate]] or cold stability in wine. This innovation may save megawatts of electricity used to chill wine in warm climates. It is more stable than [[metatartaric acid]] and is very effective in inhibiting tartrate precipitation. It is reported that [[Potassium bitartrate|KHT]] crystals, in presence of CMC, grow slower and change their morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Gerbaud |first=Vincent |date=18 October 1996 |title=Determination de l'etat de sursaturation et effet des polysaccharides sur la cristallisation du bitartrate de potassium dans les vins |trans-title=Determination of the state of supersaturation and effect of polysaccharides on the crystallization of potassium bitartrate in wines |type=Ph.D. |chapter= |publisher=[[National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse|Institut National Polytechnique de Talouse]] |docket=961NP1030G |url= http://ethesis.inp-toulouse.fr/archive/00001182/01/gerbaud.pdf|access-date=2017-05-07 |language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their shape becomes flatter because they lose 2 of the 7 faces, changing their dimensions. CMC molecules, negatively charged at wine pH, interact with the electropositive surface of the crystals, where potassium ions are accumulated. The slower growth of the crystals and the modification of their shape are caused by the competition between CMC molecules and bitartrate ions for binding to the KHT crystals (Cracherau et al. 2001).

In veterinary medicine, CMC is used in abdominal surgeries in large animals, particularly horses, to prevent the formation of bowel adhesions.

CMC is sometimes used as an electrode binder in advanced battery applications (i.e. [[lithium ion batteries]]), especially with [[graphite#Batteries|graphite]] anodes. CMC's water solubility allows for less toxic and costly processing than with non-water soluble binders, like the traditional [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF), which requires toxic [[n-methylpyrrolidone]] (NMP) for processing. CMC is often used in conjunction with [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber (SBR) for electrodes requiring extra flexibility, e.g. for use with silicon-containing anodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celluloseether.com/applications-sodium-carboxymethyl-cellulose-binder-batteries/] Applications of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose As a Binder In Batteries&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culinary uses===
CMC powder is widely used in the ice cream industry. It is used to make ice creams without churning mechanism or extreme low temperatures thereby eliminating the need of the conventional churners or salt ice mixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bahramparvar |first1=Maryam |last2=Mazaheri Tehrani |first2=Mostafa |date=3 March 2011 |title=Application and Functions of Stabilizers in Ice Cream |url=http://profdoc.um.ac.ir/articles/a/1022651.pdf |journal=Food Reviews International |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=389–407 |doi=10.1080/87559129.2011.563399}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMC is used in bakery products like breads and cake preparation. The use of CMC gives loaf a much improved quality at a reduced cost to the baker economizing on the fat component. CMC is also used as an emulsifier in producing high quality biscuits. Due to CMC, fat disperses uniformly in the dough and hence CMC improves the release of the dough from the moulds and cutters to achieve well-shaped biscuits without any distorted edges. It can help to reduce consumption of egg yolk or fat used in making biscuits, thus achieving economy. Use of CMC in candy preparation ensures smooth dispersion in flavour oils, improves texture &amp; quality. They are used in chewing gums, margarines and peanut butter as emulsifier, also it is used in leather crafting to burnish the edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tarladalal.com/glossary-cmc-1226i|title=C.m.c.

===Enzymology===
CMC has also been used extensively to characterize enzyme activity from endoglucanases (part of the [[cellulase]] complex). CMC is a highly specific substrate for endo-acting cellulases, as its structure has been engineered to decrystallize [[cellulose]] and create amorphous sites that are ideal for endoglucanase action. CMC is desirable because the catalysis product ([[glucose]]) is easily measured using a [[reducing sugar]] assay, such as [[3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid]]. Using CMC in enzyme assays is especially important in regard to screening for cellulase enzymes that are needed for more efficient [[cellulosic ethanol]] conversion. However, CMC has also been misused in earlier work with cellulase enzymes, as many had associated whole cellulase activity with CMC hydrolysis. As the mechanism of cellul

==Adverse reactions==
While thought to be uncommon, case reports of severe reactions to carboxymethyl cellulose exist. In one such instance, a woman was known to experience anaphylaxis following exposure.&lt;ref name="AAAAI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaaai.org/ask-the-expert/carboxymethylcellulose |title=Anaphylaxis to carboxymethylcellulose |last=Lieberman |first=Phil |publisher=[[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170712011138/http://www.aaaai.org/ask-the-expert/carboxymethylcellulose |archivedate=2017-07-12 |accessdate=2017-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skin testing is believed to be a useful diagnostic tool for this purpose.&lt;ref name="AAAAI"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">The '''Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens'''  (also: Zentral-Verein, Central Verein, CV, C.V., C.-V.) (Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith) was founded by [[Germany|German]] Jewish intellectuals on 26 March 1893 in [[Berlin]], with the intention of opposing the rise of [[antisemitism]] in the [[German Empire]]. Shortly after its founding it had 1,420, and in 1926 approximately 60,000 members.

==History==
It was founded in Berlin by Jewish intellectuals on 26 March 1893. The CV’s aim was to unify German citizens of [[Judaism|Jewish faith]], to fight for the Jews’ rights as citizens and to combat rising antisemitism.  Commitment to the German Nation was an important part of the CV’s agenda - the members saw themselves primarily as German citizens with their own religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Horne |first=John |title=State, Society and Mobilization in Europe During the First World War |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-521-52266-8 |page=91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the CV repudiated [[Zionism]].

Beginning in 1922, the CV published a weekly newspaper, called '''''C.V.-Zeitung''''' (C.V.-Newspaper) and continued fighting the rising antisemitic threat. Through publications and conversations with the [[President of Germany (Weimar Republic)|President of Germany]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and economic leaders the CV tried to call attention to the threat. In 1926 there were approximately 60,000 members.

[[File:Gedenktafel Pariser Str 44 (Wilmd) C.-V..jpg|thumb|Plaque outside the Pariser Strasse offices]]
In 1928 the "Büro Wilhelmstrasse" (Wilhelmstrasse Office) was created with instrumental support of [[Alfred Wiener]]. It documented [[Nazism|Nazi]] activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933, when [[Hitler]] came to power.&lt;ref&gt;C.V.-Zeitung (CVZ) 2 February 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Nazi era, the CV was forced to change its name several times.  From 1936 onwards it was called "Jüdischer Central Verein" (Jewish Central Association).&lt;ref&gt;CVZ, 13 August 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[Kristallnacht]] (Night of Broken Glass or November Pogrom) in 1938 the CV had to stop publishing its newspaper and the association was prohibited a short time later.

The '''Cluster Munition Coalition''' ('''CMC''') is an international civil society movement campaigning against the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of [[cluster munitions]]. Cluster munitions are a type of [[explosive weapon]] widely stockpiled by more than 80 states. They are documented to have caused significant civilian deaths and injuries and have frequently caused indiscriminate effects both during and after conflicts. Their use is prohibited under the 2008 [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]]. This convention was formally endorsed on 30 May 2008 in [[Dublin]], Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/05/clusterbomb_ban_us_opposes_pas.html Baltimore- Sun - Cluster-bomb ban U.S. opposes passes (actual passage)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602063409/http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/05/clusterbomb_ban_us_opposes_pas.html |date=2008-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was signed by 94 countries in [[Oslo]] on 3–4 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7762031.stm BBC Nations sign cluster bomb treaty]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-10829976 entered into force] and became binding international law on 1 August 2010, after 30 countries formally ratified it. As of 4 January 2012, it had been signed by 111 countries, 77 of which have ratified it.

The CMC, formed in November 2003, is a network of civil society organizations, including NGOs, faith-based groups and professional organizations. It includes large worldwide organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Handicap International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], as well as nationally based organizations (such as the [[Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society]] and [[Legacies of war|Legacies of War]]) and national campaigns (such as the Philippines Campaign against Cluster Munitions and the Aotearoa New Zealand Cluster Munition Coalition).

All of these organizations share a common goal of preventing the adverse humanitarian and development impacts from [[cluster munitions]] and providing assistance to the victims and survivors of cluster munitions, as well as ensuring their inclusion in society. Organizations and individuals that make up the CMC also work directly to address the effects of cluster munitions through the course of their work in conflict zones, providing assistance to victims, clearing areas contaminated by cluster munitions, investigating human rights abuses and violations of [[international humanitarian law]].

Members of the CMC network worked together on an international campaign to ban cluster munitions and successfully brought about the signature by 94 countries of the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]] in Oslo on 3–4 December 2008. The CMC is now campaigning for accession and ratification of this comprehensive ban by all states its full and effective implementation by all States Parties; the universalization of its norms; and the rigorous monitoring of states' compliance with it.

The CMC is an example of the emerging model of international diplomacy that involves the coordination of global grassroots initiatives to promote a specific goal, engaging in an international diplomatic process in partnership with like-minded states. An important focus for the CMC was to ensure those affected by cluster munitions were able to play a key role in shaping the outcome of the campaign and the international treaty it has brought about. This has been demonstrated by affected states such as [[Lebanon]] and [[Lao PDR]], who were at the forefront of the diplomatic negotiations, as well as the active roles played within the CMC by individual survivors of cluster bombs (such as Branislav Kapetanovic and others involved with the [[Ban Advocates]] initiative set up by Handicap International).

In 2011, the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] (ICBL) and Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC) merged into one unified structure, now known as the ICBL-CMC, in order to realize operational efficiencies and reinforce complementary work. The ICBL and the CMC campaigns remain separate and continue to remind governments of their commitments to implement and promote both treaties. Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor continues its unique civil society monitoring program on the humanitarian and developmental consequences of landmines, cluster munitions, and explosive remnants of war.

The activities of the ICBL-CMC are supported by a Governance Board representative of various elements of the ICBL that provides strategic, financial and human resources oversight. An Advisory Committee provides more regular input to staff and the working of the campaign. Four ambassadors serve as campaign representatives at speaking events and other conferences worldwide. They include Jody Williams, Tun Channareth (Cambodian landmine survivor), Song Kosal (Cambodian landmine survivor), and Margaret Arech Orech (Ugandan landmine survivor and founder of Ugandan Landmine Survivors Association). Currently, the ICBL has 14 staff members based in Geneva (the central office), Lyon, Paris, and Ottawa. Additionally, the ICBL-CMC hosts several interns each year.

Through their activities, the member organizations that make up the CMC have researched the effects of [[cluster munitions]] on civilians. [http://www.the-monitor.org Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor] is the ICBL-CMC's research and monitoring arm. It is the ''de facto'' monitoring regime for the Mine Ban Treaty and the Convention on Cluster Munitions. It monitors and reports on States Parties' implementation of and compliance with the Mine Ban Treaty and the Convention on Cluster Munitions, and more generally, it assesses the problems caused by landmines, cluster munitions, and other explosive remnants of war (ERW). The Monitor represents the first time that NGOs have come together in a coordinated, systematic, and sustained way to monitor humanitarian law or disarmament treaties, and to regularly document progress and problems, thereby successfully putting into practice the concept of civil society-based verification. Since its creation in 1998, Monitor research has been carried out by a global network of primarily in-country researchers, most of them ICBL-CMC campaigners, and all content undergoes rigorous editing by the Monitor's Editorial Team prior to publication.

The '''Congo Free State''' ({{lang-fr|État indépendant du Congo}}, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} "Independent State of the Congo"; {{lang-nl|Kongo-Vrijstaat}}) was a large state in [[Central Africa]] from 1885 to 1908. It was ruled personally by [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] and operated entirely separate from Belgium, of which he was also king. Leopold II was able to [[Colonization of the Congo|procure the region]] by convincing other [[Eurasia]]n states at the [[Berlin Conference]] that he was involved in humanitarian and philanthropic work and would not tax trade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=France and Britain in Africa.

On 29 May 1885, the king announced that he planned to rename his new colony "the Congo Free State", a name which officially replaced "Association Internationale Africaine" on 1 August 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis, Sabine. 1991.

Tervuren: Royal Museum for Central Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; The Congo Free State operated as a corporate state privately controlled by Leopold II through a [[non-governmental organization]], the [[International Association of the Congo]]. The state included the entire area of the present [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and existed from 1885 to 1908, when the government of Belgium [[Colonial Charter on the Belgian annexation of the Congo Free State|reluctantly annexed]] the area.&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of the Belgian Congo|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/59/|publisher=World DIgital Library|accessdate=21 January 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Leopold's reign in the Congo eventually earned infamy on account of the [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State|atrocities perpetrated on the locals]]. Leopold II's Free State extracted [[ivory]], [[Congo rubber|rubber]] and minerals in the upper Congo basin for sale on the world market through a series of international [[Abir Congo Company|concessionary companies]], even though its ostensible purpose in the region was to uplift the local people and develop the area. Under Leopold II's administration, the Congo Free State became one of the greatest international scandals of the early 20th century. The [[Casement Report]] of the British Consul [[Roger Casement]] led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for killings during a rubber-collecting expedition in 1903.{{Citation Needed|date=September 2018}}

The loss of life and atrocities inspired literature such as [[Joseph Conrad|Joseph Conrad's]] novel ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and raised an international outcry.

==Background==
{{Main|Colonization of the Congo}}{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}

===Early European exploration===
[[Diogo Cão]] traveled around the mouth of the [[Congo River]] in 1482,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=65|title=World Exploration From Ancient Times|author=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|year=2011|isbn=9781615354559}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] to claim the region as England did with River Victoria. Until the middle of the 19th century, the Congo was at the heart of independent Africa, as European colonialists seldom entered the interior. Along with fierce local resistance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crossingtheoceansea.com/OceanSeaPages/OS-51-DiogoCaoCongo.html|title=Crossing the Ocean Sea - Diogo Cão Reaches the Congo|website=www.crossingtheoceansea.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[rainforest]], [[swamp]]s, and attendant [[malaria]], and other diseases such as [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] made it a difficult environment for Europeans to settle. Western states were at first reluctant to colonize the area in the absence of obvious economic benefits.

===Stanley's exploration===
[[File:Henry Morton Stanley 1.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Henry Morton Stanley]], whose exploration of the Congo region at Leopold's invitation led to the establishment of the Congo Free State under personal sovereignty]]
In 1876 [[Leopold II of Belgium]] hosted [[Brussels Geographic Conference|a geographic conference]] in [[Brussels]], inviting famous explorers, philanthropists, and members of geographic societies to stir up interest in a "humanitarian" endeavor for Europeans to take in central Africa to "improve" and "civilize" the lives of the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1014377418|title=European atrocity, African catastrophe : Leopold II, the Congo Free State and its aftermath|last=Ewans|first=Martin|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=1317849086|location=London|pages=41|oclc=1014377418}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conference, Leopold organized the [[International African Association]] with the cooperation of European and American explorers and the support of several European governments, and was himself elected chairman. Leopold used the association to promote plans to seize independent central Africa under this philanthropic guise.

[[Henry Morton Stanley]], famous for making contact with British missionary [[David Livingstone]] in Africa in 1871, later explored the region during a journey that ended in 1877 and was described in Stanley's 1878 novel ''Through the Dark Continent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/throughdarkcont00unkngoog|via=Internet Archive|title=Through the Dark Continent|author=Sir Henry Morton Stanley|year=1978|location=New York|publisher=Harper and Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failing to enlist British interest in developing the Congo region, Stanley took up service with Leopold II, who hired him to help gain a foothold in the region and annex the region for himself.&lt;ref name=NIE/&gt;

From August 1879 to June 1884 Stanley was in the Congo basin, where he built a road from the lower Congo up to [[Pool Malebo|Stanley Pool]] and launched steamers on the upper river. While exploring the Congo for Leopold, Stanley set up treaties with the local chiefs and with native leaders.&lt;ref name=NIE/&gt; Few to none of these tribal leaders had a realistic idea of what they were signing, and, in essence, the documents gave over all rights of their respective pieces of land to King Leopold II. With Stanley's help, Leopold was able to claim a great area along the [[Congo River]], and [[military base|military posts]] were established.

[[Christian de Bonchamps]], a French explorer who served Leopold in [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], expressed attitudes towards such treaties shared by many Europeans, saying, "The treaties with these little African tyrants, which generally consist of four long pages of which they do not understand a word, and to which they sign a cross in order to have peace and to receive gifts, are really only serious matters for the European powers, in the event of disputes over the territories. They do not concern the black sovereign who signs them for a moment."&lt;ref name=RPJ1&gt;[http://collin.francois.free.fr/Le_tour_du_monde/ René de Pont-Jest: ''L'Expédition du Katanga, d'après les notes de voyage du marquis Christian de Bonchamps''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205012517/http://collin.francois.free.fr/Le_tour_du_monde/ |date=February 5, 2010 }} published 1892 in: Edouard Charton (editor): ''Le Tour du Monde'' magazine, website accessed 5 May 2007. Section I: "D'ailleurs ces lettres de soumission de ces petits tyrans africains, auxquels on lit quatre longues pages, dont, le plus souvent, ils ne comprennent pas un mot, et qu'ils approuvent d'une croix, afin d'avoir la, paix et des présents, ne sont sérieuses que pour les puissances européennes, en cas de contestations de territoires. Quant au souverain noir qui les signe, il ne s'en inquiète pas un seul instant."&lt;/ref&gt;

===King Leopold's campaign===
Leopold began to create a plan to convince other European powers of the legitimacy of his claim to the region, all the while maintaining the guise that his work was for the benefit of the native peoples under the name of a philanthropic "association".

The king launched a publicity campaign in Britain to distract critics, drawing attention to Portugal's record of slavery, and offering to drive slave traders from the Congo basin. He also secretly told British merchant houses that if he was given formal control of the Congo for this and other humanitarian purposes, he would then give them the same [[most favored nation]] (MFN) status Portugal had offered them. At the same time, Leopold promised Bismarck he would not give any one nation special status, and that German traders would be as welcome as any other.

}}
Leopold then offered France the support of the association for French ownership of the entire northern bank of the Congo, and sweetened the deal by proposing that, if his personal wealth proved insufficient to hold the entire Congo, as seemed utterly inevitable, that it should revert to France. On April 23, 1884, the International Association's claim on the southern Congo basin was formally recognized by France on condition that the French got the first option to buy the territory if the association decided to sell. This may also have helped Leopold in gaining recognition for his claim by the other major powers, who thus wanted him to succeed instead of selling his claims to France.&lt;ref&gt;Pakenham 1991, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also enlisted the aid of the United States, sending President [[Chester A. Arthur]] carefully edited copies of the cloth-and-trinket treaties British explorer Henry Morton Stanley claimed to have negotiated with various local authorities, and proposing that, as an entirely disinterested humanitarian body, the association would administer the Congo for the good of all, handing over power to the locals as soon as they were ready for that responsibility.

[[King Leopold II|King Leopold]] wanted to have the United States to support his plans for the Congo in order to have support from the European nations. He had help from [[Henry Shelton Sanford]] who helped employ [[Henry Morton Stanley]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;who became an important asset to Leopold’s plan. Henry Sanford swayed [[Chester A. Arthur]] by inviting him to stay as his guest at Sanford House hotel on Lake Monroe while he was in [[Belgium]].  On November 29, 1883, during his meeting with the President, as Leopold’s envoy, he convinced the President that Leopold agenda was similar to the United States involvement in Liberia. This satisfied Southern politicians and businessmen, especially [[John Tyler Morgan]]. Morgan saw Congo as the same opportunity to send freedmen to Africa so they can contribute and build the cotton market. Sanford also convinced the people in New York that they were going to abolish slavery and aid travelers and scientists in order to have the public support. After Henry actions of convincing President Chester A. Arthur, the United States was the first country to recognize Congo as a legitimate sovereign state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-02-18/news/0102160536_1_sanford-king-leopold-congo|title=Sanford Was Pawn In Congo Plot|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbying and claiming the region===
Leopold was able to attract scientific and humanitarian backing for the [[International African Association]] ({{lang-fr|Association internationale africaine}}, or AIA), which he formed during a [[Brussels Geographic Conference]] of geographic societies, explorers, and dignitaries he hosted in 1876. At the conference, Leopold proposed establishing an international benevolent committee for the propagation of civilization among the peoples of central Africa (the Congo region). Originally conceived as a multi-national, scientific, and humanitarian assembly, the AIA eventually became a development company controlled by Leopold.

After 1879 and the crumbling of the International African Association, Leopold's work was done under the auspices of the "Committee for Studies of the Upper Congo" ({{lang-fr|Comité d'Études du Haut-Congo}}). The committee, supposedly an international commercial, scientific, and humanitarian group, was in fact made of a group of businessmen who had shares in the Congo, with Leopold holding a large block by proxy. The committee itself eventually disintegrated (but Leopold continued to refer to it and use the defunct organization as a smokescreen for his operations in laying claim to the Congo region).

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="Belgium does not need a colony. Belgians are not drawn towards overseas enterprises: they prefer to spend their energy and capital in countries which have already been explored or on less risky schemes&amp;nbsp;... Still, you can assure His Majesty of my whole-hearted sympathy for the generous plan he had conceived, as long as the Congo does not make any international difficulties for us."|source=[[Walthère Frère-Orban]], Liberal [[Prime Minister of Belgium]], 1878–84.{{sfn|Ascherson|1999|p=136}} }}

Determined to look for a colony for himself and inspired by recent reports from central Africa, Leopold began patronizing a number of leading explorers, including [[Henry Morton Stanley]].{{sfn|Pakenham|1991|pp=12–15}} Leopold established the [[International African Association]], a charitable organization to oversee the exploration and surveying of a territory based around the [[Congo River]], with the stated goal of bringing humanitarian assistance and civilization to the natives. In the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85, European leaders officially noted Leopold's control over the {{convert|1000000|sqmi}} of the notionally-independent Congo Free State.{{sfn|Pakenham|1991|pp=253–5}}

To give his African operations a name that could serve for a political entity, Leopold created, between 1879 and 1882, the [[International Association of the Congo]] ({{lang-fr|Association internationale du Congo}}, or AIC) as a new umbrella organization. This organization sought to combine the numerous small territories acquired into one sovereign state and asked for recognition from the European powers. On April 22, 1884, thanks to the successful lobbying of businessman [[Henry Shelton Sanford]] at Leopold's request, President [[Chester A. Arthur]] of the [[United States]] decided that the cessions claimed by Leopold from the local leaders were lawful and recognized the International Association of the Congo's claim on the region, becoming the first country to do so. In 1884, the US Secretary of State said, "The Government of the United States announces its sympathy with and approval of the humane and benevolent purposes of the International Association of the Congo."&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild 1998, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin Conference===
In November 1884, [[Otto von Bismarck]] convened a 14-nation conference to submit the Congo question to international control and to finalize the colonial partitioning of the African continent. Most major powers (including [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Belgium]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[United States]]) attended the [[Berlin Conference]], and drafted an international code governing the way that European countries should behave as they acquired African territory. The conference officially recognized the International Congo Association, and specified that it should have no connection with Belgium or any other country, but would be under the personal control of King Leopold, i.e., [[personal union]].

It drew specific boundaries and specified that all nations should have access to do business in the Congo with no tariffs. The slave trade would be suppressed. In 1885, Leopold emerged triumphant. France was given {{convert|666,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} on the north bank (the modern [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]] and [[Central African Republic]]), Portugal {{convert|909,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} to the south (modern [[Angola]]), and Leopold's personal organisation received the balance: {{convert|2,344,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, with about 30 million people.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} However, it still remained for these territories to be occupied under the conference's [[Berlin Conference#Principle of Effective Occupation|"Principle of Effective Occupation"]].

===International recognition===
Following the United States's recognition of Leopold's colony, other European powers deliberated on the news. Portugal flirted with the French at first, but the British offered to support Portugal's claim to the entire Congo in return for a free trade agreement and to spite their French rivals. Britain was uneasy at French expansion and had a technical claim on the Congo via Lieutenant [[Verney Lovett Cameron|Cameron]]'s 1873 expedition from [[Zanzibar]] to bring home [[David Livingstone|Livingstone]]'s body, but was reluctant to take on yet another expensive, unproductive colony. [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] of Germany had vast new holdings in [[German South-West Africa|southwest Africa]], and had no plans for the Congo, but was happy to see rivals Britain and France excluded from the colony.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1885, Leopold's efforts to establish Belgian influence in the Congo Basin were awarded with the ''État Indépendant du Congo'' (CFS, Congo Free State). By a resolution passed in the Belgian parliament, Leopold became ''roi souverain'', sovereign king, of the newly formed CFS, over which he enjoyed nearly absolute control. The CFS (today the Democratic Republic of the Congo), a country of over two million square kilometers, became Leopold's personal property, the ''Domaine Privé''. Eventually,{{when|date=November 2016}} the Congo Free State was recognized as a neutral independent sovereignty&lt;ref name=NIE&gt;''New International Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; by various European and North American states.

==Government==
[[File:Leopold ii garter knight.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]], King of the Belgians and ''de facto'' owner of the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908]]

Leopold used the title Sovereign King as ruler of the Congo Free State. He appointed the heads of the three departments of state: interior, foreign affairs and finances. Each was headed by an administrator-general (''administrateur-général''), later a secretary-general (''secrétaire-général''), who was obligated to enact the policies of the sovereign or else resign. Below the secretaries-general were a series of bureaucrats of decreasing rank: directors general (''directeurs généraux''), directors (''directeurs''), ''chefs de divisions'' (division chiefs) and ''chefs de bureaux'' (bureau chiefs). The departments were headquartered in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name=Gann&gt;Lewis H. Gann and Peter Duignan (1979), ''The Rulers of Belgian Africa, 1884–1914'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press), 86–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finance was in charge of accounting for income and expenditure and tracking the public debt. Besides diplomacy, foreign affairs was in charge of shipping, education, religion and commerce. The department of the interior was responsible for defence, police, public health and public works. It was also charged with overseeing the exploitation of the Congo's natural resources and plantations. In 1904, the secretary-general of the interior set up a propaganda office, the ''Bureau central de la presse'' ("Central Press Bureau"), in [[Frankfurt]] under the auspices of the ''Comité pour la représentation des intérêts coloniaux en Afrique'' (in German, ''Komitee zur Wahrung der kolonialen Interessen in Afrika'', "Committee for the Representation of Colonial Interests in Africa").&lt;ref name=Gann/&gt;

The oversight of all the departments was nominally in the hands of the Governor-General (''Gouverneur général''), but this office was at times more honorary than real. When the governor-general was in Belgium he was represented in the Congo by a vice governor-general (''vice-gouverneur général''), who was nominally equal in rank to a secretary-general but in fact was beneath them in power and influence. A ''Comité consultatif'' (consultative committee) made up of civil servants was set up in 1887 to assist the governor-general, but he was not obliged to consult it. The vice governor-general on the ground had a state secretary through whom he communicated with his district officers.&lt;ref name=Gann/&gt;

The Free State had an independent judiciary headed by a minister of justice at Boma. The minister was equal in rank to the vice governor-general and initially answered to the governor-general, but was eventually made responsible to the sovereign alone. There was a supreme court composed of three judges, which heard appeals, and below it a high court of one judge. These sat at Boma. In addition to these, there were district courts and public prosecutors (''procureurs d'état''). Justice, however, was slow and the system ill-suited to a frontier society.&lt;ref&gt;Gann and Duignan (1979), 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leopold's rule==
[[File:Kongovrijstaat.jpg|thumb|Map of the Congo Free State in 1892]]
Leopold no longer needed the façade of the ''association'', and replaced it with an appointed cabinet of Belgians who would do his bidding. To the temporary new capital of [[Boma, Kongo Central|Boma]], he sent a governor-general and a chief of police. The vast [[Congo basin]] was split up into 14 administrative districts, each district into zones, each zone into sectors, and each sector into posts. From the district commissioners down to post level, every appointed head was European. However, with little financial means the Free State mainly relied on local elites to rule and tax the vast and hard-to-reach Congolese interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Roo|first=Bas|date=2014|title=The blurred lines of legality.

Leopold pledged to suppress the east African slave trade; promote humanitarian policies; guarantee free trade within the colony; impose no import duties for twenty years; and encourage philanthropic and scientific enterprises. Beginning in the mid-1880s, Leopold first decreed that the state asserted rights of proprietorship over all vacant lands throughout the Congo territory. In three successive decrees, Leopold promised the rights of the Congolese in their land to native villages and farms, essentially making nearly all of the CFS ''terres domainales'' (state-owned land).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://westerncivguides.umwblogs.org/2012/03/27/2547/|title=Congo’s brutal regime under King Leopold II of Belgium : Western Civilization II Guides|last=|first=|date=27 March 2012|website=westerncivguides.umwblogs.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold further decreed that merchants should limit their commercial operations in rubber trade with the natives.

For example, the slaving gangs of [[Zanzibar]] trader [[Tippu Tip]] had a strong presence in the eastern part of the territory in the modern-day [[Maniema]], [[Tanganyika Province|Tanganika]] and [[Ituri Province|Ituri]] regions. They were linked to the [[Swahili coast]] via [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]] and had established independent slave states.

===Early economics and concessions===
[[File:StoryoftheCongoFreeState 46.jpg|thumb|Congo Free State, 1899]]
[[File:196 Boma. - La revu.jpg|thumb|'La revue' of the [[Force Publique]], [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]], capital city of the Congo Free State, 1899]]

Leopold could not meet the costs of running the Congo Free State. Desperately, he set in motion a system to maximize revenue. The first change was the introduction of the concept of ''terres vacantes'', "vacant" land, which was any land that did not contain a habitation or a cultivated garden plot. All of this land (i.e., most of the country) was therefore deemed to belong to the state. Servants of the state (namely any men in Leopold's employ) were encouraged to exploit it.

Shortly after the anti-slavery conference he held in Brussels in 1889, Leopold issued a new decree which said that Africans could only sell their harvested products (mostly ivory and rubber) to the state in a large part of the Free State. This law grew out of the earlier decree which had said that all "unoccupied" land belonged to the state. Any ivory or rubber collected from the state-owned land, the reasoning went, must belong to the state; creating a de facto state-controlled monopoly. Suddenly, the only outlet a large share of the local population had for their products was the state, which could set purchase prices and therefore could control the amount of income the Congolese could receive for their work. However, for local elites this system presented new opportunities as the Free State and concession companies paid them with guns to tax their subjects in kind.

Trading companies began to lose out to the free state government, which not only paid no taxes but also collected all the potential income. These companies were outraged by the restrictions on [[free trade]], which the [[Berlin Conference|Berlin Act]] had so carefully protected years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Roo|first=Bas|date=2015|title=The Trouble with Tariffs: Customs Policies and the Shaky Balance between Colonial and Private Interests in the Congo (1886-1914)|url=https://www.academia.edu/26890340|journal=Low Countries Journal of Social and Economic History|volume=10|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their protests against the violation of free trade prompted Leopold to take another, less obvious tack to make money.

[[File:Congo concessions.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The concessions and the ''Domaine de la Couronne.'' The infamous [[Abir Congo Company|A.B.I.R.]] company is shown in dark red.]]

A decree in 1892 divided the ''terres vacantes'' into a domainal system, which privatized extraction rights over rubber for the state in certain private domains, allowing Leopold to grant vast concessions to private companies. In other areas, private companies could continue to trade but were highly restricted and taxed. The domainal system enforced an in-kind tax on the Free State's Congolese subjects. As essential intermediaries, local rulers forced their men, women and children to collect rubber, ivory and foodstuffs. Depending on the power of local rulers, the Free State paid below rising market prices.&lt;ref&gt;Vos, J. (2008). "The Economics of the Kwango rubber trade c. 1900". ''Angola on the Move: Transport Routes, Communications and History''. B. Heintze and A. von Oppen. Frankfurt am Main, Lembeck: 85–98.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1892, Leopold granted concessions to a number of companies. Each company was given a large amount of land in the Congo Free State on which to collect rubber and ivory for sale in Europe. These companies were allowed to detain Africans who did not work hard enough, to police their vast areas as they saw fit and to take all the products of the forest for themselves. In return for their concessions, these companies paid an annual dividend to the Free State. At the height of the rubber boom, from 1901 until 1906, these dividends also filled the royal coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonial Exploitation and Economic Development.

The Free Trade Zone in the Congo was open to entrepreneurs of any European nation, who were allowed to buy 10-&amp;nbsp;and 15-year monopoly leases on anything of value: [[ivory]] from a district or the [[rubber]] concession, for example. The other zone—almost two-thirds of the Congo—became the ''Domaine Privé'', the exclusive private property of the state.

In 1893, Leopold excised the most readily accessible {{convert|259,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} portion of the Free Trade Zone and declared it to be the ''Domaine de la Couronne'', literally, "fief of the crown".

===Scramble for Katanga===
{{Main article|Stairs Expedition}}
[[File:Cecil Rhodes ww.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cecil Rhodes]] attempted to expand British territory northward into the [[Congo basin]], presenting a problem for Leopold II.]]

Early in Leopold's rule, the second problem—the British South Africa Company's expansionism into the southern Congo Basin—was addressed. The distant [[Yeke Kingdom]], in [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] on the upper [[Lualaba River]], had signed no treaties, was known to be rich in [[copper]] and thought to have much gold from its slave-trading activities. Its powerful ''mwami'' (big chief), [[Msiri]], had already rejected a treaty brought by [[Alfred Sharpe]] on behalf of [[Cecil Rhodes]]. In 1891 a Free State expedition extracted a letter from Msiri agreeing to their agents coming to Katanga and later that year Leopold II sent the well-armed [[Stairs Expedition]], led by the Canadian-British captain [[William Grant Stairs]], to take possession of Katanga one way or another.&lt;ref name="Moloney 1893: Chapter X–XI"&gt;Moloney (1893): Chapter X–XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Msiri tried to play the Free State off against Rhodes and when negotiations bogged down, Stairs flew the Free State flag anyway and gave Msiri an ultimatum. Instead, Msiri decamped to another [[Boma (enclosure)|stockade]]. Stairs sent a force to capture him but Msiri stood his ground, whereupon Captain [[Omer Bodson]] shot Msiri dead and was fatally wounded in the resulting fight.&lt;ref name="Moloney 1893: Chapter X–XI"/&gt; The expedition cut off Msiri's head and put it on a pole, as he had often done to his enemies. This was to impress upon the locals that Msiri's rule had really ended, after which the successor chief recognized by Stairs signed the treaty.&lt;ref name=RPJ2&gt;[http://collin.francois.free.fr/Le_tour_du_monde/ René de Pont-Jest: ''L'Expédition du Katanga, d'après les notes de voyage du marquis Christian de Bonchamps''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205012517/http://collin.francois.free.fr/Le_tour_du_monde/ |date=February 5, 2010 }} published 1892 in: Edouard Charton (editor): ''Le Tour du Monde'' magazine, website accessed 5 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War with Arab slavers===
{{Main article|Congo Arab war}}
[[File:Muhammad bin Khalfan bin Khamis al-Barwani alias Rumaliza.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rumaliza]], 1900]]

In the short term, the third problem, that of the [[Arab slave trade|African and Arab slavers]] like [[Zanzibar]]i/Swahili strongman [[Tippu Tip]] (nom de guerre)—his real name was Hamad bin Muhammad bin Juma bin Rajab el Murjebi—was temporarily solved. Initially the authority of the Congo Free State was relatively weak in the eastern regions of the Congo.

In early 1887, [[Henry Morton Stanley]] arrived in [[Zanzibar]] and proposed that ''Tippu Tip'' be made [[governor]] (wali) of the [[Kisangani|Stanley Falls District]]. Both [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] and [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Barghash bin Said]] agreed and on February 24, 1887, Tippu Tip accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and Brode&lt;/ref&gt;

In the longer term this alliance was undefendable at home and abroad. Leopold II was heavily criticized by the European public opinion, for his dealings with Tippu Tip. In Belgium, the [[Belgian Anti-Slavery Society]] was founded in [[1888]], mainly by Catholic intellectuals, led by count [[Hippolyte d'Ursel]], aimed at abolishing the [[Arab slave trade]]. Furthermore, Tippu Tip and Leopold were commercial rivals. Every person that Tippu Tip hunted down and put into [[chattel slavery]] and every pound of ivory he exported to [[Zanzibar]] was a loss to Leopold II. This, and Leopold's humanitarian pledges to the [[Berlin Conference]] to end slavery, meant war was inevitable.

Open warfare broke out in late November 1892. Both sides fought by proxy, arming and leading the populations of the upper Congo forests in a conflict. By early 1894 the Zanzibari/Swahili slavers were defeated in the eastern Congo region and the [[Congo Arab war]] came to an end.

=== The Lado Enclave ===
{{Main article|Battle of Rejaf}}
[[File:BaronDhanisGala.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francis Dhanis]], c. 1900]]

In 1894, King Leopold II signed a treaty with Great Britain which conceded a strip of land on the Free State's eastern border in exchange for the [[Lado Enclave]], which provided access to the navigable Nile and extended the Free State's sphere of influence northwards into [[South Sudan|Sudan]]. After rubber profits soared in 1895, Leopold ordered the organization of an expedition into the Lado Enclave, which had been overrun by [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdist]] rebels since the outbreak of the [[Mahdist War]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Louis, William (2006). ''Ends of British Imperialism''. I.B.Tauris. {{ISBN|978-1-84511-347-6}}. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was composed of two columns: the first, under Belgian war hero [[Francis Dhanis|Baron Dhanis]], consisted of a sizable force, numbering around three-thousand, and was to strike north through the jungle and attack the rebels at their base at Rejaf. The second, a much smaller force of only eight-hundred, was led by [[Louis-Napoléon Chaltin]] and took the main road towards Rejaf. Both expeditions set out in December 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Charles de Kavanagh Boulger, Demetrius (1898).''The Congo State: Or, The Growth of Civilisation in Central Africa''. Congo: W. Thacker &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-217-57889-6}}. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Leopold II had initially planned for the expedition to carry on much farther than the Lado Enclave, hoping indeed to take [[Fashoda]] and then [[Khartoum]], [[Batetela rebellion|Dhanis' column mutinied]] in February 1897, resulting in the death of several Belgian officers and the loss of his entire force.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Fox Bourne 1903 p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Chaltin continued his advance, and on 17 February 1897, his outnumbered forces defeated the rebels in the [[Battle of Rejaf]], securing the Lado Enclave as a Belgian territory until Leopold's death in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Pakenham 1991 p. 525–526.&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold's conquest of the Lado Enclave pleased the British government, at least initially, which welcomed any aid in their ongoing war with Mahdist Sudan. But frequent raids outside of Lado territory by Belgian Congolese forces based in [[Rejaf]] caused alarm and suspicion among British and French officials wary of Leopold's imperial ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Fox Bourne (1903), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, following the Belgian annexation of the Congo Free State as the [[Belgian Congo]] in 1908 and the death of the Belgian King in December 1909, British authorities reclaimed the Lado Enclave as per the Anglo-Congolese treaty signed in 1894, and added the territory to [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lado-Enclave|title=Lado Enclave|last=|first=|date=19 July 2011|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy during Leopold's rule==
[[File:ELdelCongo.jpg|thumb|300px|Clearing [[tropical forest]]s ate away at profit margins. However, ample plots of cleared land were already available. Above, a Congolese farming village (Baringa, [[Équateur Province|Equateur]]) is emptied and leveled to make way for a rubber plantation.]]

While the war against African powers was ending, the quest for income was increasing, fueled by the [[concession (contract)|aire]] policy. By 1890, Leopold was facing considerable financial difficulty. District officials' salaries were reduced to a bare minimum, and made up with a commission payment based on the profit that their area returned to Leopold. After widespread criticism, this "primes system" was substituted for the ''allocation de retraite'' in which a large part of the payment was granted, at the end of the service, only to those territorial agents and magistrates whose conduct was judged "satisfactory" by their superiors. This meant in practice that nothing changed. Congolese communities in the ''Domaine Privé'' were not merely forbidden by law to sell items to anyone but the state; they were required to provide state officials with set quotas of rubber and ivory at a fixed, government-mandated price and to provide food to the local post.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In direct violation of his promises of free trade within the CFS under the terms of the Berlin Treaty, not only had the state become a commercial entity directly or indirectly trading within its dominion, but also, Leopold had been slowly monopolizing a considerable amount of the ivory and rubber trade by imposing export duties on the resources traded by other merchants within the CFS. In terms of infrastructure, Leopold's regime began construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). This project, known today as the [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway]], took years to complete.

[[File:Punch congo rubber cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|A 1906 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon depicting Leopold II as a rubber vine entangling a Congolese man.]]

By the final decade of the 19th century, [[John Boyd Dunlop]]’s 1887 invention of inflatable, rubber bicycle tubes and the growing popularity of the automobile dramatically increased global demand for [[rubber]]. To monopolize the resources of the entire Congo Free State, Leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that reduced the native population to serfs. Collectively, these forced the natives to deliver all ivory and rubber, harvested or found, to state officers thus nearly completing Leopold's monopoly of the ivory and rubber trade. The rubber came from wild vines in the jungle, unlike the rubber from [[First Brazilian Republic|Brazil]] (''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]''), which was tapped from trees. To extract the rubber, instead of tapping the vines, the Congolese workers would slash them and lather their bodies with the rubber latex. When the latex hardened, it would be scraped off the skin in a painful manner, as it took off the worker's hair with it.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Adam. ''[[King Leopold's Ghost|King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa]]''. [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]]: [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]], 1998, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Force Publique]]'' (FP), Leopold's private army, was used to enforce the rubber quotas. Early on, the FP was used primarily to campaign against the Arab slave trade in the Upper Congo, protect Leopold's economic interests, and suppress the frequent uprisings within the state. The Force Publique's officer corps included only white Europeans (Belgian regular soldiers and mercenaries from other countries). On arriving in the Congo, these recruited men from Zanzibar and west Africa, and eventually from the Congo itself. In addition, Leopold had been actually encouraging the slave trade among Arabs in the Upper Congo in return for slaves to fill the ranks of the FP. During the 1890s, the FP's primary role was to exploit the natives as [[corvée]] laborers to promote the rubber trade.

Many of the black soldiers were from far-off peoples of the Upper Congo, while others had been kidnapped in raids on villages in their childhood and brought to Roman Catholic missions, where they received a military training in conditions close to slavery. Armed with modern weapons and the ''[[chicotte]]''—a bull whip made of [[hippopotamus]] hide—the ''Force Publique'' routinely took and tortured hostages, slaughtered families of rebels, and flogged and raped Congolese people with a reign of terror and abuse that cost millions of lives. One refugee from these horrors described the process:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We were always in the forest to find the rubber vines, to go without food, and our women had to give up cultivating the fields and gardens. Then we starved.... When we failed and our rubber was short, the soldiers came to our towns and killed us. Many were shot, some had their ears cut off; others were tied up with ropes round their necks and taken away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonial Encounters in the Age of High Imperialism|last=Cook|first=Scott B.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1996|isbn=9780673992291|location=New York|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also burned recalcitrant villages, and above all, cut off the hands of Congolese natives, including children. The human hands were collected as trophies on the orders of their officers to show that bullets had not been wasted. Officers were concerned that their subordinates might waste their ammunition on hunting animals for sport, so they required soldiers to submit one hand for every bullet spent.&lt;ref name="caw"&gt;Cawthorne, Nigel.

&lt;/ref&gt; These mutilations also served to further terrorize the Congolese into submission. This was all contrary to the promises of uplift made at the Berlin Conference which had recognized the Congo Free State.

===Mutilation===
{{anchor|Severed hands}}
[[File:MutilatedChildrenFromCongo.jpg|thumb|Mutilated Congolese children, image from ''[[King Leopold's Soliloquy]]'', [[Mark Twain]]’s political [[satire]], where the aging king complains that the incorruptible camera was the only witness he had encountered in his long experience that he could not bribe. The book was illustrated with photographs by [[John Hobbis Harris|Harris]]]]

Failure to meet the rubber collection quotas was punishable by death. Meanwhile, the Force Publique were required to provide the hand of their victims as proof when they had shot and killed someone, as it was believed that they would otherwise use the munitions (imported from Europe at considerable cost) for hunting.&lt;ref name="caw"/&gt; As a consequence, the rubber quotas were in part paid off in chopped-off hands. Sometimes the hands were collected by the soldiers of the Force Publique, sometimes by the villages themselves. There were even small wars where villages attacked neighboring villages to gather hands, since their rubber quotas were too unrealistic to fill. A Catholic priest quotes a man, Tswambe, speaking of the hated state official Léon Fiévez, who ran a district along the river {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} north of [[Pool Malebo|Stanley Pool]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All blacks saw this man as the devil of the [[Equator]] ... From all the bodies killed in the field, you had to cut off the hands. He wanted to see the number of hands cut off by each soldier, who had to bring them in baskets ... A village which refused to provide rubber would be completely swept clean. As a young man, I saw [Fiévez's] soldier Molili, then guarding the village of Boyeka, take a net, put ten arrested natives in it, attach big stones to the net, and make it tumble into the river ... Rubber causes these torments; that's why we no longer want to hear its name spoken. Soldiers made young men kill or [[rape]] their own mothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, ''King Leopold's Ghost'', 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One junior officer described a raid to punish a village that had protested. The officer in command "ordered us to cut off the heads of the men and hang them on the village palisades ... and to hang the women and the children on the palisade in the form of a cross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourne |first=Henry Richard Fox |title=Civilisation in Congoland: A Story of International Wrong-doing |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jWccAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Civilisation+in+Congoland%22#PPR3,M1 |accessdate=2007-09-26 |year=1903 |publisher=P. S. King &amp; Son |location=London |pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing a Congolese person killed for the first time, a Danish missionary wrote, "The soldier said 'Don't take this to heart so much. They kill us if we don't bring the rubber. The Commissioner has promised us if we have plenty of hands he will shorten our service.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbath |first=Peter |title=The River Congo: The Discovery, Exploration and Exploitation of the World's Most Dramatic Rivers |year=1977 |publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]] |location= |isbn=978-0-06-122490-4 |pages=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Forbath's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The baskets of severed hands, set down at the feet of the European post commanders, became the symbol of the Congo Free State. ... The collection of hands became an end in itself. ''Force Publique'' soldiers brought them to the stations in place of rubber; they even went out to harvest them instead of rubber ... They became a sort of currency. They came to be used to make up for shortfalls in rubber quotas, to replace ... the people who were demanded for the forced labour gangs; and the ''Force Publique'' soldiers were paid their bonuses on the basis of how many hands they collected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In theory, each right hand proved a killing. In practice, to save ammunition soldiers sometimes "cheated" by simply cutting off the hand and leaving the victim to live or die. More than a few survivors later said that they had lived through a massacre by acting dead, not moving even when their hands were severed, and waiting till the soldiers left before seeking help. In some instances a soldier could shorten his service term by bringing more hands than the other soldiers, which led to widespread mutilations and dismemberment.

===Death toll===
[[File:Nsala of Wala in Congo looks at the severed hand and foot of his five-year old daughter, 1904.jpg|thumb|A Congolese man looking at the severed hand and foot of his five-year-old daughter who was killed, and allegedly cannibalized, by the members of [[Abir Congo Company|Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company]] militia, 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Morel, E. D. (1904) ''King Leopold's Rule in Africa''. London: William Heinnemann, p. 144-145&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A reduction of the population of the Congo is noted by all who have compared the country at the beginning of Leopold's control with the beginning of Belgian state rule in 1908, but estimates of the death toll vary considerably. Estimates of some contemporary observers suggest that the population decreased by half during this period. According to [[E. D. Morel|Edmund D. Morel]], the Congo Free State counted "20 million souls".&lt;ref&gt;Morel, E. D. (1904) ''King Leopold's Rule in Africa''. London: William Heinnemann, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, [[Mark Twain]] mentioned the number of ten million deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Twain, M. (1905) ''King Leopold’s soliloquy a defense of his Congo rule''. Boston: P. R. Warren Co., p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to British diplomat [[Roger Casement]], this depopulation had four main causes: "indiscriminate war", starvation, reduction of births, and disease.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. pp. 226–232.&lt;/ref&gt; [[African trypanosomiasis|Sleeping sickness]] was also a major cause of fatality at the time. Opponents of Leopold's rule stated, however, that the administration itself was to be considered responsible for the spreading of the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. pp. 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of a census providing even an initial idea of the size of population of the region at the inception of the Congo Free State (the first was taken in 1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelton |first=D. |title=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity |year=2005 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-02-865849-0 |pages=621}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is impossible to quantify population changes in the period. Despite this, Forbath more recently claimed the loss was at least five million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbath |first=P. |title=The River Congo: The Discovery, Exploration, and Exploitation of the World's Most Dramatic River, 1991 (Paperback) |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=978-0-06-122490-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Hochschild]] and [[Jan Vansina]] use the number 10 million. Hochschild cites several recent independent lines of investigation, by anthropologist Jan Vansina and others, that examine local sources (police records, religious records, oral traditions, genealogies, personal diaries), which generally agree with the assessment of the 1919 Belgian government commission: roughly half the population perished during the Free State period. Since the first official census by the Belgian authorities in 1924 put the population at about 10 million, these various approaches suggest a rough estimate of a total of 10 million dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Hochschild |authorlink=Adam Hochschild |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-74329-160-3 |pages=225–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Vansina returned to the issue of quantifying the total population decline, and revised his earlier position, he concluded that the Kuba population (one of the many Congolese populations) was rising during the first two decades of Leopold II's rule, and declined with 25 percent from 1900 to 1919, mainly due to sickness.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Vansina is an anthropologist that made quantitative estimates based on qualitative research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vansina, Jan (2010).

''Belgium and the Congo, 1885–1980''. New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-19421-1}}. p 25&lt;/ref&gt; Others argued a decrease of 20 percent over the first forty years of colonial rule (up to the census of 1924).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.congo2005.be/geheugen/brochureEN.pdf pages 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Congolese historian Isidore Ndaywel è Nziem 13 million died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Histoire générale du Congo: De l'héritage ancien à la République Démocratique|author=Ndaywel è Nziem, I}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put these population changes in context, sourced references state that in 1900 [[Africa]] as a whole had between 90 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=G. |title=What Went Wrong with Africa? |department=Review |journal=[[African Studies Review]] |volume=49 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=179–181 |doi=10.1353/arw.2006.0081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 133 million people.&lt;ref&gt;World Population Prospects: The 2006 Revision&lt;/ref&gt; However, no verifiable records exist. Louis and Stengers state that population figures at the start of Leopold's control are only "wild guesses", while calling E. D.

Oxford: Clarendon, pp. 252–257.&lt;/ref&gt; However, authors that point out the lack of reliable demographic data are questioned by others calling the former minimalists and agnosticists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roes | first1 = A | year = 2010 | title = Towards a History of Mass Violence in the Etat Indépendant du Congo, 1885-1908 | url = | journal = South African Historical Journal | volume = 62 | issue = 4| page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; proving that these questions remain the object of heated debate.

==International criticism==
{{Main article|Congo Free State propaganda war|Casement Report}}
Leopold ran up high debts with his Congo investments before the beginning of the worldwide rubber boom in the 1890s. Prices increased throughout the decade as industries discovered new uses for rubber in tires, hoses, tubing, insulation for [[telegraph]] and telephone cables and wiring. By the late-1890s, wild rubber had far surpassed ivory as the main source of revenue from the Congo Free State. The peak year was 1903, with rubber fetching the highest price and concessionary companies raking in the highest profits.

However, the boom sparked efforts to find lower-cost producers. Congolese concessionary companies started facing competition from rubber cultivation in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. As [[plantation]]s were begun in other tropical areas—mostly under the ownership of the rival British firms—world rubber prices started to dip. Competition heightened the drive to exploit forced labour in the Congo in order to lower production costs. Meanwhile, the cost of enforcement was eating away at profit margins, along with the toll taken by the increasingly unsustainable harvesting methods. As competition from other areas of rubber cultivation mounted, Leopold's private rule was left increasingly vulnerable to international scrutiny.

[[Missionary|Missionaries]] were allowed only on sufferance, and Leopold was able to silence the Belgian [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]].{{clarify|date=November 2016}} Rumours circulated so Leopold attempted to discredit them, even creating a Commission for the Protection of the Natives. Publishers were bribed, critics accused of running secret campaigns to further other nations' colonial ambitions, and eyewitness reports from missionaries such as [[William Henry Sheppard]] dismissed as attempts by [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to smear Catholic priests.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} For at least a decade, criticism was largely contained.

===Congo Reform Association===
[[File:Casement Roger.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Roger Casement]]]]
[[File:1922_Edmund_Dene_Morel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[E.D. Morel]]]]

[[Joseph Conrad]]’s novel ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', originally published in 1899 as a three-part series in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', inspired by his service as a captain on a steamer on the Congo 12 years before, sparked an organized international opposition to Leopold's exploitational activities.&lt;!--Heart of Darkness is a [[novel]] --&gt; In 1900, [[E. D. Morel|Edmund Dene Morel]], a part-time journalist and head of trade with Congo for the [[Liverpool]] shipping firm [[Elder Dempster]], noticed that ships that brought vast loads of rubber from the Congo only ever returned there loaded with guns and ammunition for the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Morel became a journalist and then a publisher, attempting to discredit Leopold's regime. In 1902, Morel retired from his position at Elder Dempster to focus on campaigning. He founded his own magazine, ''The West African Mail'', and conducted speaking tours in Britain.

Increasing public outcry over the atrocities in the CFS moved the British government to launch an official investigation. In 1903, Morel and those who agreed with him in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]&lt;!-- is morel in house of commons? not previously mentioned --&gt; succeeded in passing a resolution calling on the British government to conduct an inquiry into alleged violations of the [[Berlin Agreement]]. [[Roger Casement]], then the British Consul at [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]] (at the mouth of the [[Congo River]]), was sent to the Congo Free State to investigate. Reporting back to the [[Foreign Office]] in 1900, Casement wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The root of the evil lies in the fact that the government of the Congo is above all a commercial trust, that everything else is orientated towards commercial gain...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

E. D. Morel was introduced to Roger Casement by their mutual friend [[Herbert Ward (sculptor)|Herbert Ward]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C3suCpMEC4UC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=%22Herbert+Ward%22+Morel+casement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WkxxjTXkAf&amp;sig=Pb-Gubq2EPSWmTmCppZspZzWfdQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S_DIU8rjHKbe7AaI4YG4Dw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Herbert%20Ward%22%20Morel%20casement&amp;f=false Martial Frindéthié: ''Francophone African Cinema: History, Culture, Politics and Theory'']&lt;/ref&gt; just before the publication of Casement's 1904 detailed eyewitness report—known as the [[Casement Report]]—in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organisation for dealing specifically with the Congo question, the [[Congo Reform Association]]. With Casement's and Dr. Guinness's assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold's control of the Congo Free State. Branches of the association were established as far away as the United States. The Congo Reform movement's members included Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Mark Twain]], Joseph Conrad, [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[Bertrand Russell]].

The mass deaths in the Congo Free State became a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' in the last years of the 19th century. The Congo reform movement led a vigorous international movement against the maltreatment of the Congolese population.&lt;ref name="RJR"&gt;[[R. J.

"[https://www.theguardian.com/print/0,3858,4460659-103681,00.html Belgium exhumes its colonial demons]". ''[[The Guardian]]'', July 13, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Parliament]] demanded a meeting of the 14 signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. The [[Belgian Parliament]], pushed by [[Emile Vandervelde]] and other critics of the king's Congolese policy, forced Leopold to set up an independent commission of inquiry, and despite the king's efforts, in 1905 it confirmed Casement's report.

One of the main ways England was involved in ending [[Leopold II of Belgium]]’s rule in the Congo, was by making Belgium, as a whole, more aware of the brutality present in the Congo. [[E. D. Morel]] was one of the key activists of England for a Congo free from Belgium rule. Once the U.S became aware of the occurences in the Congo, Morel began the [[Congo Reform Association]]. One of the methods Morel used to make the world more aware of the atrocities in the Congo during Leopold’s rule was through the press. Articles were published in both magazines and articles in order to make the people of these powerful countries, such as the U.S and England, more aware of what truly was being done in this part of [[Africa]]. With this newfound unwanted publicity, the Belgium government was pressured in assuming control of the Congo from Leopold.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297a/The%20Congo%20From%20Leopold%20to%20Lumumba.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals such as [[George Washington Williams]] also had a significant impact in the events that surrounded the [[Congo Free State propaganda war]]. In his famous letter, "An Open Letter to His Serene Majesty Léopold II, King of the Belgians and Sovereign of the Independent State of Congo”,  that was sent on July 18, 1890, Williams essentially exposed the true atrocities committed by [[Leopold II of Belgium]]. It was after this, that his letter became published throughout mass media outlets around the world and enlightened many individuals about the true side of Leopold. In his letter, Williams went into greater depth about the crimes that were pinned against the residents of the Congo and their overall mistreatment. It would be this letter, that would initiate the widespread call for justice against the horrors of the Congo, caused by [[Leopold II of Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/George_W._Williams|title=George W.

==Belgian annexation of the Congo Free State as the Belgian Congo==
{{Main|Belgian Congo}}
[[File:Proclamation on the founding of the Belgian Congo.JPG|thumb|Proclamation from Inspector-general Ghislain to the population of the Congo, announcing the annexation of the territory by Belgium in 1908.]]

Leopold II offered to reform his Congo Free State regime, but international opinion supported an end to the king's rule, and no nation was willing to accept this responsibility. Belgium was the obvious European candidate to annex the Congo Free State. For two years, it debated the question and held new elections on the issue.

Yielding to international pressure, the [[parliament of Belgium]] annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration on November 15, 1908, as the [[colony]] of the [[Belgian Congo]]. The governance of the Belgian Congo was outlined in the 1908 [[Colonial Charter on the Belgian annexation of the Congo Free State|Colonial Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;Senelle, R., and E. Clément (2009), ''Léopold II et la Charte Coloniale'', Brussels: Editions Mols.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being effectively removed from power, the international scrutiny was no major loss to Leopold II—who died in Brussels on 17 December 1909—or the concessionary companies in the Congo. By then Southeast Asia and Latin America had become lower-cost producers of rubber. Along with the effects of resource depletion in the Congo, international [[commodity]] [[price]]s had fallen to a level that rendered Congolese extraction unprofitable. Just prior to releasing sovereignty over the CFS, Leopold had all evidence of his activities in the CFS destroyed, including the archives of the departments of finance and of the interior. Leopold II lost the absolute power he had had there, but the population now had a Belgian colonial regime, which had become heavily [[Paternalism|paternalistic]], with church, state, and private companies all instructed to oversee the welfare of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Patrick, The African Diaspora, pg. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]], originally created in 1897, rewarded heroic deeds and service achieved while serving in the Congo Free State. The Order was made a decoration of the Belgian state with the abolition of the Congo Free State in 1908 and is still awarded today.

Between 1886 and 1908 Free State issued a number of [[postage stamp]]s. These typically showed scenes of wildlife, landscapes, and natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stamps_of_Congo_Free_State|title=Stamps of Congo Free State - Wikimedia Commons|website=commons.wikimedia.org|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stampaday.wordpress.com/2017/08/16/congo-free-state-24-1894/|title=Congo Free State #24 (1894)|last=|first=|date=2017-08-16|work=A Stamp A Day|access-date=2018-09-11|others=From the collection of Mark Jochim|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins were minted from 1887 to 1908, using the Belgian standard. They ranged from a copper 1 [[Centime]] through a silver 5 [[Franc]]s. The lower values showed a star on the obverse and were holed, the higher ones had a bust of Leopold II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgs.com/news/lets-go-to-africa/|title=Let's Go to Africa|website=Pcgs.com|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genocide question===
In the aftermath of the 1998 publication of ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'' by [[Adam Hochschild]], where he had written "the killing in the Congo was of genocidal proportions", but "it was not strictly speaking a genocide",&lt;ref name="JoGResearch"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weisbord |first1=Robert G. |year=2003 |title=The King, the Cardinal and the Pope: Leopold II's genocide in the Congo and the Vatican |journal=Journal of Genocide Research |volume=5 |pages=35–45 |doi=10.1080/14623520305651}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]] in Brussels would finance an investigation into some of the claims made by Hochschild. An investigatory panel announced in 2002, likely to be headed by Professor Jean-Luc Vellut, was scheduled to report its findings in 2004.&lt;ref name="Osborn_2002" /&gt; Robert G. Weisbord stated in the 2003 ''Journal of Genocide Research'' that attempting to eliminate a portion of the population is enough to qualify as genocide under the UN convention. In the case of the Congo Free State, the unbearable conditions would qualify as a genocide.&lt;ref name="JoGResearch"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the report, an exhibition was held at the Royal Museum for Central Africa entitled ''The Memory of Congo''. Critics, including Hochschild, claimed that there were "distortions and evasions" in the exhibition and stated "The exhibit deals with this question in a wall panel misleadingly headed 'Genocide in the Congo?' This is a red herring, for no reputable historian of the Congo has made charges of genocide; a forced labor system, although it may be equally deadly, is different."&lt;ref name="heart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2005/oct/06/in-the-heart-of-darkness/?pagination=false|title=In the Heart of Darkness|author=Hochschild, Adam|website=The New York Review of Books|date=October 6, 2005|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[early day motion]] presented to the [[British Parliament]] in 2006 described "the tragedy of King Leopold's regime" as [[genocide]] and called for an apology from the Belgian government. It received the signature of 48 members of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2005-06/2251|title=Early day motion 2251 - COLONIAL GENOCIDE AND THE CONGO|website=UK Parliament|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corruption in North Korea''' is a widespread and growing problem in North Korean society. [[North Korea]] is ranked 175 out of 177 countries in [[Transparency International]]'s 2013 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (tied with [[Somalia]] and [[Afghanistan]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/results 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index] [[Transparency International]]&lt;/ref&gt; Strict rules and draconian punishments imposed by the regime, for example, against accessing foreign media or for modifying radio or television receivers to access foreign media, are commonly evaded by offering bribes to the police.

'''Dissent in Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu''' was voicing disagreements with the government policies of [[Communist Romania]] during the [[totalitarian]] rule of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] after the [[July Theses]] in 1971. Because of the strong secret police (the [[Securitate]]) and harsh punishments, open dissent was rare. Notable acts of dissent include [[Paul Goma]]'s 1977 letters to Ceaușescu, the founding of [[SLOMR]] (an independent workers' union) in 1979 and a number of work conflicts, such as the [[Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977]] and the [[Braşov Rebellion]] of 1987.

Dissent from within the [[Romanian Communist Party]] came for the first time from [[Constantin Pîrvulescu]], a veteran party member who, in 1979, during the [[12th Congress of the Communist Party of Romania|12th Party Congress]], accused Ceaușescu of putting personal interests in front of those of the party. Pîrvulescu was excluded from the party, but, in 1989, together with other five party veterans signed the [[Letter of the Six]], an open letter written by [[Silviu Brucan]] which was a left-wing critique of Ceaușescu.

The [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] began as an act of dissent, as people began supporting Hungarian pastor [[László Tőkés]], who was about to be evicted for dissent.

==1960s counterculture==

Starting with the mid-1960s, a counterculture developed in Romania among the Romanian youth and students. While this culture shared the aesthetics of the Western [[Counterculture of the 1960s]] (for instance hippie fashion or [[rock and roll]]) and its [[anti-authoritarianism]], from an ideological point of view, it wasn't integrated in the worldwide countercultural movement.&lt;ref name="Fichter, p. 567"&gt;Fichter, p. 567&lt;/ref&gt; The counterculture used nationalist rhetoric and unlike its Western or Yugoslav counterpart, where it embraced the "[[New Left]]" and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|opposed]] the [[Vietnam War]], in Romania, it was [[Criticism of socialism|skeptical]] of [[socialism]], even if [[liberal socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Fichter, p. 574&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were aware of the movements in the west, they never shared their goals or had any interest in declaring solidarity with them.&lt;ref name=Fichter568&gt;Fichter, p. 568&lt;/ref&gt;

A dissident community flourished as Romania became more liberal and allowed more [[freedom of expression]]. Nonconformist literature, film, theatre, music, philosophy boomed as young intellectuals challenged the abuses of the early era of [[Socialist Romania]] and demanded more freedom of thought and expression, as well as a better standard of living.&lt;ref name=Fichter568/&gt; The counterculture did support some goals with the government, such as reform and the independence from the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Fichter, p. 578&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the culture of protest within the counterculture came in December 1968 when a group of a few hundred student protesters were beaten by the police and their leaders were arrested.&lt;ref name="Fichter, p. 567"/&gt;  Ceaușescu warned against any art and political positions that were against the regime in 1969, while the following year, he explicitly banned such countercultural activities and in 1971, with the [[July Theses]], a "mini-[[Cultural Revolution]]" began that demanded strict conformity.&lt;ref&gt;Fichter, p. 578-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romanian Communist Party]] took over the film, theatre and literary communities and demanded them to adhere to [[socialist realism]]. While this did not end the counterculture, it greatly diminished its scale. Critics of the regime were routinely harassed by the police, expelled from the party or fired their workplace and they often fled abroad.&lt;ref name=Fichter579&gt;Fichter, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists and intellectuals, such as [[Cornel Chiriac]], fled to [[Western Europe]], while others, such as [[Adrian Păunescu]] (who was attacked in 1972 for his subversive activities and complaints about [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censorship]]) joined the regime's [[propaganda]] machine.&lt;ref name=Fichter579/&gt;

==Goma's 1977 letters==
[[Paul Goma]], a [[Bessarabia]]n-born writer, provided the earliest challenge to the Ceaușescu regime in the spring of 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.235&lt;/ref&gt; Goma had challenged the previous communist governments of Romania: in 1956, he read at university a chapter of a novel describing a student movements similar to the one of [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].&lt;ref name="Deletant, p.236"&gt;Deletant, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the manuscript for his novel, ''Obstinato'', was denied publication and so was his next novel, ''Gherla'', both of which were published in French and German translations.&lt;ref name="Deletant, p.236"/&gt;

Becoming frustrated with the ban of his writings and inspired by the Czechoslovak [[Charter 77]], Goma wrote a letter of support to [[Pavel Kohout]]. Finding few friends willing to sign it, he invited [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] to sign it.&lt;ref name="Deletant, p.236"/&gt; In a letter addressed to Ceaușescu, he told him that he can't find people to sign the letter because they are afraid of the [[Securitate]] and that the only two Romanians not afraid of the Securitatea are him and Ceaușescu.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.238&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the intimidations of the Securitate, Goma's letter got over 200 signatures (including the support of psychiatrist [[Ion Vianu]] and literary critic [[Ion Negoiţescu]]), but it was denounced by Ceaușescu, who attacked "the traitors of the country".&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.239&lt;/ref&gt; As he wrote an even harsher letter to Ceaușescu, Goma was excluded from the Writers' Union, arrested and attacked in a variety of magazines such as ''[[Săptămâna]]'', ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'' and ''[[Contemporanul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.241&lt;/ref&gt; After an international appeal, he was released and in November 1977 he went into exile in France.&lt;ref name=Deletant242&gt;Deletant, p.242&lt;/ref&gt;

Goma continued to criticize the Ceaușescu regime from Paris and in 1982, the Romanian authorities ordered a Romanian secret agent, [[Matei Pavel Haiducu]], to kill Goma, together with another dissident, [[Virgil Tănase]] by injecting a poison which would cause cardiac arrest. Nevertheless, Haiducu refused the order by defecting to the French authorities.&lt;ref name=Deletant242/&gt;

==Labour disputes==

===Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977===
{{main|Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977}}
Only a few months after Goma's lettes, the first major strike occurred on a Romanian company. The immediate cause of the strike was the new July 1977 legislation which ended disability pensions for miners and increased the retirement age for miners from 50 to 53.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.243&lt;/ref&gt; Ceaușescu made a commission led by [[Ilie Verdeț]] to go to Lupeni and discuss with the miners, but they were apprehended by the miners, who demanded Ceaușescu to come.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceaușescu came to Lupeni on the same day and in front of the angry crowd, he agreed to have a six-hour day throughout the Jiu Valley, to build factories that would provide employment for the miners' wives and daughters and to that no punishment would be given against the miners who organized the strike. After this, the crowds dispersed and the miners continued working.&lt;ref name="Deletant245"&gt;Deletant, p.245&lt;/ref&gt;

The promises were not kept, as in the following months, the Securitate began its investigations and repression, with 4000 miners being sent to other mining areas and others imprisoned.&lt;ref name="Deletant245"/&gt; Neither were the concessions regarding the six-hour day and the retirement age were kept, the only promise kept was about the creation of jobs for the miners' families.&lt;ref name="Deletant246"&gt;Deletant, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the Jiu Valley strikes, there was a total [[media blackout]] about the event.&lt;ref name="Deletant246"/&gt;

===Free Trade Union of the Working People of Romania, 1979===
{{main|SLOMR}}
A group of 15 workers at the shipyards of [[Turnu Severin]], helped by an MD, [[Ionel Cană]], founded a free trade union, the founding declaration of which was broadcast on the [[Radio Free Europe]] on March 4, 1979. It soon attracted over 2400 signatures from workers throughout the country. They got the support of [[Paul Goma]] and [[Gheorghe Calciu]], a dissident orthodox priest.&lt;ref name=Deletant247/&gt;

Its manifesto called for the legalization of independent trade unions and the right to [[Freedom of association|free association]]. As some of its members, including Cană and economist [[Gheorghe Broșoveanu]] were arrested, the union protested against the repression through an [[open letter]]. The next chairman of the trade union was sentenced to 18 months in prison for "passing state secrets to [[Amnesty International]]".&lt;ref name=Deletant247&gt;Deletant, p.247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strikes during the austerity of the 1980s===
{{main|1980s austerity policy in Romania}}
Ceaușescu introduced a series of very harsh austerity measures in order to cut the imports and repay the debts acquired from the Western banks. Food and energy were rationized and the real value of the wage was cut.&lt;ref name=Deletant248&gt;Deletant, p.248&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1983, miners from seven metal mines of [[Maramureș]] went on strike to protest pay cuts, the strike being quelled by the Securitate.&lt;ref name=Deletant248/&gt; Further strikes were started at the Heavy Machinery Plant and the Refrigeration Plant in [[Cluj-Napoca]], as well as at the glass factory in Turda in November 1984 following the reduction of the bread ration and pay cuts for failure to fill the targets. Like in Jiu Valley, the Party promised to meet the demands of the workers and Securitate launched an investigation and moving some workers to other areas.&lt;ref name=Deletant249&gt;Deletant, p.249&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 1987, about a thousand employees of the Nicolina rolling stocks factory in [[Iași]] protested pay cuts; 150 of the strikers were fired from the factory.&lt;ref name=Deletant249/&gt;

===Braşov strike of 1987===
{{main|Braşov Rebellion}}

On November 15, 1987, a group of several thousand workers from [[Steagul Roșu plant]] assembled in order to go and vote in the local elections. Instead they marched toward the city centre (where the local headquarters of the Party was located), singing ''[[Deșteaptă-te, române!]]'', the song of the 1848 Revolution and chanting "Down with the dictatorship!". They were joined by Braşov tractor plant workers and Brașov locals.&lt;ref name=Deletant252&gt;Deletant, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

It was five days after the implementation of a decree on reducing the heating on private dwellings (part of the [[1980s austerity policy in Romania]]) and after a second month with wage cuts due to failure to meet production targets (which couldn't be done due to lack of commercial [[Order (business)|orders]]), corroborated with food shortages.&lt;ref name=Deletant252/&gt;

The [[apparatchik]]s fled from the Party headquarters through the back entrance while the crowd tore down the headquarters' sign, smashed the windows, forced their way inside by breaking the wooden gates and destroyed the content, throwing posters, files, equipment onto the street.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; These were set alight and a similar ransacking occurred on the People's Council building on the opposite side of the road.&lt;ref name=Deletant251&gt;Deletant, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, police and military vehicles carrying armed soldiers came, as the people in the crowd tried to flee. Some were beaten up and arrested, while others were arrested from their home in the middle of the night.&lt;ref name=Deletant251/&gt; The following days, all the outstanding debts to the workers had been paid and food shops had been stocked.&lt;ref name=Deletant252/&gt;

The state media kept silence about the protests for weeks and it only acknowledged the disturbances on December 2, when [[Radio Bucharest]] announced that the workers' representatives decided to dismiss the management which had illegally reduced the wages of the workers. It also noted that the workers "who engaged in acts that are alien to our society" will be moved or be punished according to the law.&lt;ref name=Deletant254/&gt;

The Securitate investigated the protests and, by December, it compiled a list of 425 workers who were held. The group trial led to 60 protesters to be jailed for "[[hooliganism]]", being sentenced for jail terms of between one and four years.&lt;ref name=Deletant254&gt;Deletant, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissent in literature==
{{stub-section|date=December 2012}}

==Dissent from within the Party==
The earliest case of dissent from within the Party occurred during the 12th Party Congress, when [[Constantin Pîrvulescu]], an old-time party member, took the floor and argued against the re-election of Ceaușescu, arguing that he puts the personal glorification in front of the interest of the Party and the country. As a result, he was stripped of his delegate to the congress and placed under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, [http://countrystudies.us/romania/72.htm "The Ceausescu Era"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Braşov Rebellion, on November 26, 1987, former deputy director of Scînteia [[Silviu Brucan]] handed a declaration to some foreign journalists, in which he warned Ceaușescu that "a period of crisis has opened up in relations between the Romanian Communist Party and the working class" and he warned that this may lead to an isolation from both the West and the East.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; Brucan was reprimanded by the Party and put under [[house arrest]],&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.255&lt;/ref&gt; but he was released following a visit of the American [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]] [[John C. Whitehead]] to Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.257&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dumitru Mazilu]], a Romanian official was commissioned by the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in 1985 to write a report on [[human rights in Romania]]. He was due to present it in Geneva in June 1987, but he was prevented by the Romanian state. The official explanation was that he had a heart attack, but Mazilu eventually sent in 1988 a letter to the Chairman of the UN subcommission in which he talked about repressive measures taken against him after he refused to give up working on this project, including surveillance and intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.259-260&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 1989, six senior members ([[Silviu Brucan]], [[Gheorghe Apostol]], [[Alexandru Bârlădeanu]], [[Grigore Răceanu]], [[Corneliu Mănescu]] and [[Constantin Pîrvulescu]]) of the Romanian Communist Party signed a letter (the ''[[Letter of the Six]]'') written by Brucan and made public to [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.274-275&lt;/ref&gt; Since they sent the letter directly abroad rather than discussing it in the Party, it shows that the Party was completely under the rule of Ceaușescu and that no party mechanism allowed discussion of party policy.&lt;ref name="deletant275"&gt;Deletant, p.275&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Doina Cornea, they did not argue for a democratic [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], but only a pluralism within the party. They argued that the "very idea of socialism" was being threatened by Ceaușescu's policies.&lt;ref name="deletant275"/&gt; The letter discussed the Systematization, the lack of observance of human rights and that in practice, the constitution was suspended and that there was no legal system in force.&lt;ref name="deletant275"/&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:ArmaTiroPumEtaMilikiliklik26 8.jpg|thumb|ETA members fire blanks during the [[Euzko Gudarostea|Day of the Basque Soldier]] of 2006]]

ETA changed its internal structure on several occasions, commonly for security reasons. The group used to have a very hierarchical organization with a leading figure at the top, delegating into three substructures: the logistical, military and political sections. Reports from Spanish and French police pointed towards significant changes in ETA's structures in its later years. ETA divided the three substructures into a total of eleven. The change was a response to captures, and possible infiltration, by the different law enforcement agencies. ETA's intention was to disperse its members and reduce the impact of detentions.

The leading committee comprised 7 to 11 individuals, and ETA's internal documentation referred to it as Zuba, an abbreviation of ''Zuzendaritza Batzordea'' (directorial committee). There was another committee named ''Zuba-hitu'' that functioned as an advisory committee. The eleven different substructures were: logistics, politics, international relations with fraternal organisations, military operations, reserves, prisoner support, expropriation, information, recruitment, negotiation, and treasury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcorreodigital.com/vizcaya/pg060323/actualidad/politica/200603/23/ECD_eta_funcionamiento.html POLÍTICA – ETA ha modificado su estructura interna por motivos de seguridad]. El Correo Digital (1 December 1997). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

ETA's armed operations were organized in different ''taldes'' ("groups") or ''commandos'', generally composed of three to five members, whose objective was to conduct attacks in a specific geographic zone.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The ''taldes'' were coordinated by the ''cúpula militar'' ("military [[cupola]]"). To supply the ''taldes'', support groups maintained [[safe house]]s and ''zulos'' (small rooms concealed in forests, [[garret]]s or underground, used to store arms, explosives or, sometimes, kidnapped people; the Basque word ''zulo'' literally means "hole"). The small cellars used to hide the people kidnapped are named by ETA and ETA's supporters "people's jails".&lt;ref name="La Razón Técnico"&gt;''[http://www.belt.es/noticias/2004/octubre/21/eta_zulo.htm «El técnico» construyó los zulos de ETA]'', [[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]], 18 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common ''commandos'' were itinerant, not linked to any specific area, and thus were more difficult to capture.&lt;ref&gt;Riding, Alan. (11 July 1992) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0D7143DF932A25754C0A964958260 OLYMPICS – OLYMPICS – Keeping Terrorism at Bay in Barcelona – NYTimes.com]. New York Times. Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its members, ETA distinguished between ''legales/legalak'' ("legal ones"), those members who did not have police records and lived apparently normal lives; ''liberados'' ("liberated") members known to the police that were on ETA's payroll and working full-time for ETA; and ''apoyos'' ("support") who just gave occasional help and logistics support to the group when required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne Anderson|title=The ETA: Spain's Basque terrorists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZ5TNlhO5V8C&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=30 January 2011|date=January 2003|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3818-6|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also imprisoned members of the group, serving time scattered across Spain and France, that sometimes still have significant influence inside the organisation; and finally the ''quemados'' ("burnt out"), members freed after having been imprisoned or those that were suspected by the group of being under police vigilance. In the past there was also the figure of the deportees, expelled by the French government to remote countries where they lived freely. ETA's internal bulletin was named ''[[Zutabe]]'' ("Column"), replacing the earlier one (1962) ''[[Zutik (publication)|Zutik]]'' ("Standing").

ETA also promoted the ''[[kale borroka]]'' ("street fight"), that is, violent acts against public transportation, political parties offices or cultural buildings, destruction of private property of politicians, police, military, journalist, council members, and anyone voicing criticism against ETA, bank offices, menaces, graffiti of political mottoes, and general rioting, usually using [[Molotov cocktails]]. These groups were mostly made up of young people, who were directed through youth organisations (such as [[Jarrai]], [[Haika]] and [[Segi (organization)|Segi]]). Many members of ETA started their collaboration with the group as participants in the ''kale borroka''.

==Political support==

The former political party [[Batasuna]], disbanded in 2003, pursued the same political goals as ETA and did not condemn ETA's use of violence. Formerly known as [[Euskal Herritarrok]] and "[[Herri Batasuna]]", it was banned by the Spanish Supreme Court as an anti-democratic organisation following the Political Parties Law (''Ley de Partidos Políticos''&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo6-2002.html Party Law] in Spanish&lt;/ref&gt;), It generally received 10% to 20% of the vote in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/especiales/2005/03/espana/elecciones_pv/resultados.html Elecciones en el País Vasco 2005]. elmundo.es.

Batasuna's political status was controversial. It was considered to be the political wing of ETA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/56763.stm|work=BBC News  |title=ETA's political wing elects new leaders|date=14 February 1998|access-date=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-1272166/Batasuna|title=Batasuna (Basque org.) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|author=|date=|work=Britannica.com|access-date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, after the investigations on the nature of the relationship between Batasuna and ETA by Judge [[Baltasar Garzón]], who suspended the activities of the political organisation and ordered police to shut down its headquarters, the [[Supreme Court of Spain]] finally declared Batasuna illegal on 18 March 2003. The court considered proven that Batasuna had links with ETA and that it constituted in fact part of ETA's structure. In 2003, the Constitutional Tribunal upheld the legality of the law.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

However, the party itself denied being the political wing of ETA,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} although double membership – simultaneous or alternative – between Batasuna and ETA was often recorded, such as with the cases of prominent Batasuna leaders like Josu Ternera, [[Arnaldo Otegi]], Jon Salaberria and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4581987.stm|work=BBC News  |title=Basque nationalist leader jailed|date=26 May 2005|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "jvjtfe"&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/direccion/Batasuna/ETA/elpepuesp/20080521elpepunac_4/Tes De la dirección de Batasuna a la de ETA · ELPAÍS.com].

The Spanish [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] (the Spanish Parliament) began the process of declaring the party illegal in August 2002 by issuing a bill entitled the ''Ley de Partidos Políticos'' which bars political parties that use violence to achieve political goals, promote hatred against different groups or seek to destroy the democratic system. The bill passed the Cortes with a 304 to 16 vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/2002/06/05/espana/1153258.html El Congreso aprueba la Ley de Partidos con el 95% de los votos], ''El Mundo'', 5 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Many within the Basque nationalistic movement strongly disputed the Law, which they considered too draconian or even unconstitutional; alleging that any party could be made illegal almost by choice, simply for not clearly stating their opposition to an attack.

Defenders of the law argued that the ''Ley de Partidos'' did not necessarily require responses to individual acts of violence, but rather a declaration of principles explicitly rejecting violence as a means of achieving political goals. Defenders also argued that the ban of a political party is subject to judicial process, with all the guarantees of the State of Law. Batasuna had failed to produce such a statement. {{As of|2008|alt=As of February 2008}} other political parties linked to organizations such as ''[[Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted)|Partido Comunista de España (reconstituido)]]'' have also been declared illegal, and [[Acción Nacionalista Vasca]] and [[Communist Party of the Basque Lands]] (EHAK/PCTV, ''Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista/Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas'') were declared illegal in September 2008.

A new party called [[Aukera Guztiak]] ''(All the Options)'' was formed expressly for the elections to the [[Basque Parliament]] of April 2005. Its supporters claimed no heritage from Batasuna, asserting that their aim was to allow Basque citizens to freely express their political ideas, even those of independence. On the matter of political violence, Aukera Guztiak stated their right not to condemn some kinds of violence more than others if they did not see fit (in this regard, the [[Basque National Liberation Movement]] (MLNV) regards present police actions as violence, torture and state terrorism). Nevertheless, most of their members and certainly most of their leadership were former Batasuna supporters or affiliates. The Spanish Supreme Court unanimously considered the party to be a successor to Batasuna and declared a ban on it.

After Aukera Guztiak had been banned, and less than two weeks before the election, another political group appeared born from an earlier schism from Herri Batasuna, the [[Communist Party of the Basque Lands]] (EHAK/PCTV, ''Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista/Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas''), a formerly unknown political party which had no representation in the Autonomous Basque Parliament. EHAK made the announcement that they would apply the votes they obtained to sustain the political programme of the now banned Aukera Guztiak platform.

This move left no time for the Spanish courts to investigate EHAK in compliance with the ''Ley de Partidos'' before the elections were held. The bulk of Batasuna supporters voted in this election for PCTV. It obtained 9 seats of 75 (12.44% of votes) in the Basque Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/especiales/2005/03/espana/elecciones_pv/resultados/ Elecciones en el País Vasco 2005]. elmundo.es. Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The election of EHAK representatives eventually allowed the programme of the now-illegal Batasuna to continue being represented without having condemned violence as required by the ''Ley de Partidos''.

In February 2011, Sortu, a party described as "the new Batasuna",&lt;ref name="LV8F"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/politica/20110208/54111615502/el-nuevo-partido-de-la-izquierda-abertzale-se-denomina-sortu.html|title="El nuevo partido de la izquierda abertzale se denomina 'Sortu'", La Vanguardia, 8 February 2011|work=LA VANGUARDIA|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched. Unlike predecessor parties, Sortu explicitly rejects politically motivated violence, including that of ETA.&lt;ref name="LV8F"/&gt; However, on 23 March 2011, the Spanish Supreme Court banned Sortu from registering as a political party on the grounds that it was linked to ETA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spanish supreme court bans Basque separatist party Sortu for links to ETA|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/858354060|work=BBC  Monitoring European|publisher=BBC  Worldwide Limited|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish transition to democracy]] from 1975 on and ETA's progressive radicalisation have resulted in a steady loss of support, which became especially apparent at the time of their 1997 kidnapping and countdown assassination of [[Miguel Ángel Blanco]]. Their loss of sympathisers has been reflected in an erosion of support for the political parties identified with them. In the 1998 Basque parliament elections Euskal Herritarrok, formerly Batasuna, polled 17.7% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/eus/parliament.php?election=1998 Basque parliament election 1998].

According to [[Amnesty International]], [[torture]] was still "persistent", though not "systematic."

===Opinion polls===
The [[Euskobarometro]], the survey carried out by the [[Universidad del País Vasco]] (University of the Basque Country), asking about the views of ETA within the Basque population, obtained these results in May 2009:&lt;ref name="Euskobarometro"&gt;[http://alweb.ehu.es/euskobarometro/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=78&amp;Itemid=114 Euskobarómetro – EUSKOBAROMETRO MAYO 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094823/http://alweb.ehu.es/euskobarometro/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=78&amp;Itemid=114 |date=11 August 2011 }}. Alweb.ehu.es. Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 64% rejected ETA totally, 13% identified themselves as former ETA sympathisers who no longer support the group. Another 10% agreed with ETA's ends, but not their means. 3% said that their attitude towards ETA was mainly one of fear, 3% expressed indifference and 3% were undecided or did not answer. About 3% gave ETA "justified, with criticism" support (supporting the group but criticising some of their actions) and only 1% gave ETA total support. Even within Batasuna voters, at least 48% rejected ETA's violence.

This poll also reveals that the hope of a peaceful resolution to the issue of the constitutional status of the Basque region has fallen to 78% (from 90% in April).

These polls did not cover [[Navarre]], where support for Basque nationalist electoral options is weaker (around 25% of population) or the [[Northern Basque Country]] where support is even weaker (around 15% of population).

==History==

===During Franco's dictatorship===

ETA grew out of a student group called Ekin, founded in the early 1950s, which published a magazine and undertook direct action.&lt;ref name=newandcourrier&gt;{{cite news|title=Basques Stir Ferment in Spain|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fnZJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SAsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4795,3283737&amp;dq=eta+bayonne+france+1962&amp;hl=en|accessdate=21 October 2011|newspaper=The News and Courier|date=1 October 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETA was founded on 31 July 1959 as Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (Basque Homeland and Freedom) by students frustrated by the moderate stance of the [[Basque Nationalist Party]].&lt;ref name=studentgroup&gt;{{cite news|title=ETA: from student group to Basque bombers|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/8839645/ETA-from-student-group-to-Basque-bombers.html|accessdate=21 October 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Originally, the name for the organisation used the word ''Aberri'' instead of ''Euskadi'', creating the acronym ''ATA''.

ETA held their first assembly in [[Bayonne]], France, in 1962, during which a "declaration of principles" was formulated and following which a structure of activist cells was developed.&lt;ref name=Conversi&gt;{{cite book|last=Conversi|first=Daniele|title=The Basques, the Catalans, and Spain|year=1997|publisher=C.

In contrast to previous Basque nationalist platforms, Krutwig's vision was anti-religious and based upon language and culture rather than race.&lt;ref name=Conversi/&gt; ETA's third and fourth assemblies, held in 1964 and 1965, adopted an anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist position, seeing nationalism and the class struggle as intrinsically connected.&lt;ref name=Conversi/&gt;

ETA's first killing occurred on 7 June 1968, when [[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] member José Pardines Arcay was shot dead after he tried to halt ETA member [[Txabi Etxebarrieta]] during a routine road check. Etxebarrieta was chased down and killed as he tried to flee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/primer/dia/ETA/asesino/elpepuesp/20080604elpepunac_4/Tes "El primer día en el que ETA asesinó"].

The most significant assassination performed by ETA during Franco's dictatorship was [[Operación Ogro]], the December 1973 bomb assassination in [[Madrid]] of Admiral [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], Franco's chosen successor and president of the government (a position roughly equivalent to being a prime minister). The assassination had been planned for months and was executed by placing a bomb in a tunnel dug below the street where Carrero Blanco's car passed every day. The bomb blew up beneath the politician's car and threw it five stories into the air and over the top of a nearby building onto a balcony in a nearby courtyard.&lt;ref name=studentgroup/&gt;

For some in the Spanish opposition, Carrero Blanco's assassination,i.e., the elimination of Franco's chosen successor was an instrumental step for the subsequent re-establishment of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jGqNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT179&amp;lpg=PT179&amp;dq=CARRERO+BLANCO+ASSASSINATION+IMPORTANT&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nWcIzdOuIg&amp;sig=yUS15H9AAfX349-ZjGijM133bBQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCWoVChMI8P3a25ykxwIV6bNyCh2GyQOg#v=onepage&amp;q=CARRERO%20BLANCO%20ASSASSINATION%20IMPORTANT&amp;f=false The Identity of the Constitutional Subject: Selfhood, Citizenship, Culture, and Community], Chapter 4.3, Michel Rosenfeld, Routledge, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The government responded with new anti-terrorist laws which gave police greater powers and empowered military tribunals to pass death sentences against those found guilty. However, the [[last use of capital punishment in Spain]] when two ETA members were executed in September 1975, eight weeks before Franco's death, sparked massive domestic and international protests against the Spanish government.

===During the transition===
During the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] which began following Franco's death, ETA split into two separate groups: [[ETA political-military]] or ETA(pm), and ETA military or ETA(m).

Both ETA(m) and ETA(pm) refused offers of amnesty, and instead pursued and intensified their violent struggle. The years 1978–80 were to prove ETA's most deadly, with 68, 76, and 98 fatalities, respectively.

During the Franco dictatorship, ETA was able to take advantage of tolerance by the [[French government]], which allowed its members to move freely through French territory, believing that in this manner they were contributing to the end of Franco's regime. There is much controversy over the degree to which this policy of "[[sanctuary]]" continued even after the transition to democracy, but it is generally agreed that currently the French authorities collaborate closely with the Spanish government against ETA.

In the 1980s, ETA(pm) accepted the Spanish government's offer of individual pardons to all ETA prisoners, even those who had committed violent crimes, who publicly abandoned the policy of violence. This caused a new division in ETA(pm) between the seventh and eighth assemblies. ETA VII accepted this partial amnesty granted by the now democratic Spanish government and integrated into the political party ''[[Euskadiko Ezkerra]]'' ("[[left-wing politics|Left]] of the Basque Country").&lt;ref&gt;* Gaizka Fernández Soldevilla, ''Agur a las armas. EIA, Euskadiko Ezkerra y la disolución de ETA político-militar (1976–1985)'', en ''Sancho el sabio''.

ETA VIII, after a brief period of independent activity, eventually integrated into ETA(m). With no factions existing anymore, ETA(m) revamped the original name of Euskadi Ta Askatasuna.

====GAL====
During the 1980s a "dirty war" ensued by means of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación]] (GAL, "Antiterrorist Liberation Groups"), a paramilitary group which billed themselves as [[counter-terrorist]], active between 1983 and 1987. The GAL committed assassinations, kidnappings and torture, not only of ETA members but of civilians supposedly related to those, some of whom turned out to have nothing to do with ETA. 27 people were killed by GAL.&lt;ref name="santamaria437"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Diego Carcedo]]|title=Sáenz de Santa María. El general que cambió de bando|page=437|isbn=84-8460-309-1|year=2004|publisher=Temas de Hoy|location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAL activities were a follow-up of similar dirty war actions by death squads, actively supported by members of Spanish security forces and secret services, using names such as [[Batallón Vasco Español]] active from 1975 to 1981. They were responsible for the killing of about 48 people.&lt;ref name="santamaria437"/&gt;

One consequence of GAL's activities in France was the decision in 1984 by interior minister Pierre Joxe to permit the extradition of ETA suspects to Spain. Reaching this decision had taken 25 years and was critical in curbing ETA's capabilities by denial of previously safe territory in France.&lt;ref&gt;''Talking to Terrorists: Making Peace in Northern Ireland and the Basque Country'' (pp. 197–202), John Bew, Martyn Frampton, and Inigo Gurruchaga, Hurst &amp; Co., London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The airing of the state-sponsored "dirty war" scheme and the imprisonment of officials responsible for GAL in the early 1990s led to a political scandal in Spain. The group's connections with the state were unveiled by the Spanish journal [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]], with an [[investigative journalism|investigative]] series leading to the GAL plot being discovered and a national trial initiated. As a consequence, the group's attacks since the revelation have generally been dubbed [[state terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/168958.stm Europe | Former Spanish ministers jailed for 'terrorism']. BBC News (12 September 1998). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the Spanish [[Audiencia Nacional]] court finished its trial, which resulted in convictions and imprisonment of several individuals related to the GAL, including civil servants up to the highest levels of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) government, such as former Homeland Minister [[José Barrionuevo]]. Premier [[Felipe González]] was quoted as saying that the [[Rechtsstaat|constitutional state]] has to defend itself "also in the sewers" (''El Estado de derecho también se defiende en las cloacas'') something which, for some, indicated at least his knowledge of the scheme. However, his involvement with the GAL could never be proven.

These events marked the end of the armed "counter-terrorist" period in Spain and no major cases of foul play on the part of the Spanish government after 1987 (when GAL ceased to operate) have been proven in courts.

According to the radical nationalist group, Euskal Memoria, between 1960 and 2010 there were 465 deaths in the Basque Country due to (primarily Spanish) "state violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minutodigital.com/2011/02/28/los-etarras-escriben-su-historia-euskal-memoria/|title=Los etarras escriben su historia…Euskal Memoria|work=Minuto digital|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is considerably higher than those given elsewhere, which are usually between 250 and 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gara.naiz.info/paperezkoa/20101107/230664/es/474-personas-han-muerto-represion-desde-1960|title=474 personas han muerto por la represin desde 1960 - GARA|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of ETA cite only  56 members of that organisation killed by state forces since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-15-09-2003/abc/Nacional/cincuenta-y-seis-etarras-han-muerto-en-enfrentamientos-con-las-fuerzas-de-seguridad_207653.html|title=Cincuenta y seis etarras han muerto en enfrentamientos con las fuerzas de seguridad|work=ABC|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ETA members and supporters routinely claim [[torture]] at the hands of Spanish police forces.&lt;ref name="publico"/&gt; While these claims are hard to verify, some convictions are based on confessions while prisoners are held ''incomunicado'' and without access to a lawyer of their choice, for a maximum of five days. These confessions are routinely repudiated by the defendants during trials as having been extracted under torture. There have been some successful prosecutions of proven tortures during the "dirty war" period of the mid-1980s, although the penalties have been considered by [[Amnesty International]] as unjustifiably light and lenient with co-conspirators and enablers.&lt;ref name="AIUN2002"&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGEUR410122002 October 2002 AI Index: EUR 41/12/2002: SPAIN: A briefing for the United Nations Committee against Torture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021212345/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGEUR410122002 |date=21 October 2006 }}: ''Although convictions of torturers occur, these are rare.&amp;nbsp;... examining judges and prosecutors may not always be displaying due diligence&amp;nbsp;... trials involving torture complaints are often delayed for long periods.

===Under democracy===
ETA performed their first [[car bomb]] assassination in [[Madrid]] in September 1985, resulting in one death (American citizen Eugene Kent Brown, Johnson &amp; Johnson employee) and sixteen injuries; the [[Plaza República Dominicana bombing]] in July 1986 killed 12 members of the Guardia Civil and injured 50; on 19 June 1987, the [[1987 Hipercor bombing|Hipercor bombing]] was an attack in a shopping center in [[Barcelona]], killing twenty-one and injuring forty-five; in the last case, entire families were killed. The horror caused then was so striking that ETA felt compelled to issue a communiqué stating that they had given warning of the Hipercor bomb, but that the police had declined to evacuate the area. The police claim that the warning came only a few minutes before the bomb exploded.

In 1986 [[Gesto por la Paz]] (known in English as [[Association for Peace in the Basque Country]]) was founded; they began to convene silent demonstrations in communities throughout the Basque Country the day after any violent killing, whether by ETA or by GAL. These were the first systematic demonstrations in the Basque Country against political violence. Also in 1986, in [[Ordizia]], ETA shot down [[María Dolores Katarain]], known as "Yoyes", while she was walking with her infant son. Yoyes was a former member of ETA who had abandoned the armed struggle and rejoined civil society: they accused her of "desertion" because of her taking advantage of the Spanish reinsertion policy which granted amnesty to those prisoners who publicly refused political violence (see below).

On 12 January 1988, all Basque political parties except ETA-affiliated [[Batasuna|Herri Batasuna]] signed the [[Ajuria-Enea pact]] with the intent of ending ETA's violence. Weeks later on 28 January, ETA announced a 60-day "ceasefire", later prolonged several times. Negotiations known as the [[Mesa de Argel]] ("[[Algiers]] Table") took place between the ETA representative [[Eugenio Etxebeste]] ("Antxon"), and the then PSOE government of Spain but no successful conclusion was reached, and ETA eventually resumed the use of violence.

During this period, the Spanish government had a policy referred to as "[[reinsertion]]", under which imprisoned ETA members whom the government believed had genuinely abandoned violence could be freed and allowed to rejoin society. Claiming a need to prevent ETA from coercively impeding this reinsertion, the PSOE government decided that imprisoned ETA members, who previously had all been imprisoned within the Basque Country, would instead be dispersed to prisons throughout Spain, some as far from their families as in the [[Salto del Negro]] prison in the [[Canary Islands]]. France has taken a similar approach.

In the event, the only clear effect of this policy was to incite social protest, especially from nationalists and families of the prisoners, claiming cruelty of separating family members from the insurgents. Much of the protest against this policy runs under the slogan "''Euskal Presoak – Euskal Herrira''" (''Basque prisoners to the Basque Country'', by "Basque prisoners" only ETA members are meant). It has to be noted that almost in any Spanish jail there is a group of ETA prisoners, as the number of ETA prisoners makes it difficult to disperse them.

[[File:EPPK 2008.jpg|thumb|Banner in support of imprisoned ETA members, by ''[[Gestoras pro Amnistía|Gestoras pro Amnistía/Amnistiaren Aldeko Batzordeak]]'' ("Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies", currently illegal)]]

''[[Gestoras pro Amnistía|Gestoras pro Amnistía/Amnistiaren Aldeko Batzordeak]]'' ("Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies", currently illegal), later ''[[Askatasuna]]'' ("Freedom") and ''[[Senideak]]'' ("The family members") provided support for prisoners and families. The [[Basque Government]] and several Nationalist town halls granted money on humanitarian reasons for relatives to visit prisoners. The long road trips have caused accidental deaths that are protested against by Nationalist Prisoner's Family supporters.

During the ETA ceasefire of the late 1990s, the PSOE government brought back to the mainland the prisoners on the islands and in Africa.&lt;!-- Is this Ceuta and Melilla? --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Since the end of the ceasefire, ETA prisoners have not been sent back to overseas prisons. Some Basque authorities have established grants for the expenses of visiting families.

Another Spanish "counter-terrorist" law puts suspected terrorist cases under the central tribunal ''[[Audiencia Nacional]]'' in [[Madrid]], due to the threats by the group over the Basque courts. Under Article 509 suspected terrorists are subject to being held "incommunicado" for up to thirteen days, during which they have no contact with the outside world other than through the court-appointed lawyer, including informing their family of their arrest, consultation with private lawyers or examination by a physician other than the [[coroner]]s. In comparison, the [[habeas corpus]] term for other suspects is three days.

In 1992, ETA's three top leaders—"military" leader [[Francisco Mujika Garmendia]] ("Pakito"), political leader [[José Luis Alvarez Santacristina]] ("Txelis") and logistical leader [[José María Arregi Erostarbe]] ("Fiti"), often referred to collectively as the "cúpula" of ETA or as the Artapalo collective&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informativos.telecinco.es/dn_16360.htm Informativos Telecinco.com – Internacional – Trece muertos y más de cincuenta heridos en dos atentados suicidas en Bangladesh]. Informativos.telecinco.es. Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;—were arrested in the northern Basque town of [[Bidart]], which led to changes in ETA's leadership and direction.

After a two-month truce, ETA adopted even more radical positions. The principal consequence of the change appears to have been the creation of the "''[[Y Groups]]''", formed by young militants of ETA parallel groups (generally [[minor (law)|minors]]), dedicated to so-called "''kale borroka''"—street struggle—and whose activities included burning buses, street lamps, benches, [[Automatic teller machine|ATMs]], garbage containers, and throwing [[Molotov cocktail]]s. The appearance of these groups was attributed by many to the supposed weakness of ETA, which obliged them to resort to minors to maintain or augment their impact on society after arrests of leading militants, including the "cupola". ETA also began to menace leaders of other parties besides rival Basque nationalist parties.

In 1995, the armed group again launched a peace proposal. The so-called "Democratic Alternative" replaced the earlier [[Koordinadora Abertzale Sozialista|KAS]] Alternative as a minimum proposal for the establishment of Euskal Herria. The Democratic Alternative offered the cessation of all armed ETA activity if the Spanish-government would recognize the Basque people as having sovereignty over Basque territory, the right to [[self-determination]] and that it freed all ETA members in prison. The Spanish government ultimately rejected this peace offer as it would go against the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. Changing the constitution was not considered.

Also in 1995 came a failed ETA car bombing attempt directed against [[José María Aznar]], a conservative politician who was leader of the then-opposition [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) and was shortly after elected to the presidency of the government; there was also an abortive attempt in [[Majorca]] on the life of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos&amp;nbsp;I]]. Still, the act with the largest social impact came the following year. 10 July 1997, PP council member [[Miguel Ángel Blanco]] was kidnapped in the Basque town of [[Ermua]], with the separatist group threatening to assassinate him unless the Spanish government met ETA's demand of starting to bring all ETA's inmates to prisons of the Basque Country within two days after the kidnapping.

This demand was not met by the Spanish government and after three days Miguel Ángel Blanco was found shot dead when the deadline expired. More than six million people took out to the streets to demand his liberation, with massive demonstrations occurring as much in the Basque regions as elsewhere in Spain, chanting cries of "Assassins" and "Basques yes, ETA no". This response came to be known as the "Spirit of Ermua".

Later came acts of violence such as the 6 November 2001 car bomb in Madrid which injured 65 people, and attacks on [[Association football|football]] stadiums and tourist destinations throughout Spain.

The [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the USA appeared to have dealt a hard blow to ETA, owing to the worldwide toughening of "anti-terrorist" measures (such as the freezing of bank accounts), the increase in international police coordination, and the end of the toleration some countries had, up until then, extended to ETA. In addition, in 2002 the Basque nationalist youth movement, ''Jarrai'', was outlawed and the law of parties was changed outlawing Herri Batasuna, the "political arm" of ETA (although even before the change in law, Batasuna had been largely paralysed and under judicial investigation by judge [[Baltasar Garzón]]).

With ever-increasing frequency, attempted ETA actions have been frustrated by Spanish security forces.

On 24 December 2003, in San Sebastián and in [[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]], National Police arrested two ETA members who had left dynamite in a railroad car prepared to explode in [[Chamartín Station]] in Madrid. On 1 March 2004, in a place between [[Alcalá de Henares]] and [[Madrid]], a light truck with 536&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives was discovered by the Guardia Civil.

ETA was initially blamed for the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|2004 Madrid bombings]] by the outgoing government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL16484708|title=ANALYSIS-Spain's PM down but not out after ETA bomb|first=Jason|last=Webb|date=16 January 2007|agency=Reuters  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and large sections of the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/3505422.stm Europe | Spain papers point finger at Eta].

====2006 ceasefire declaration and subsequent discontinuation====
[[File:Atentado de ETA en el aeropuerto de Madrid Barajas4.jpg|thumb|Barajas Airport parking lot after the bomb]]

{{Main article|ETA's 2006 ceasefire declaration|2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing}}

In the context of negotiation with the Spanish government, ETA has declared what it has described as "truce" a number of times since its creation.

On 22 March 2006, ETA sent a DVD message to the Basque Network [[Euskal Irrati-Telebista]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/effective-on-march-24-eta-cease-fire?itemId=D20829&amp;cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&amp;idioma=en ETA cease-fire], ''eitb24'', {{Nowrap|23 March 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the journals ''[[Gara]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{fr icon}} {{eu icon}} [http://gara.net/idatzia/20060323/art156940.php ETA declara un alto el fuego permanente para impulsar un proceso democrático] ("ETA declares a permanent ceasefire to give impetus to a democratic process"), ''Gara'', {{Nowrap|3 March 2006}} (article in Spanish, text of announcement in Basque, Spanish and French.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Berria]] with a communiqué from the group announcing what it called a "permanent ceasefire" that was broadcast over Spanish TV.

Talks with the group were then officially opened by Spanish ''Presidente del Gobierno'' [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]].

These took place all over 2006, not free from incidents such as an ETA cell stealing some 300 handguns, ammunition and spare parts in France in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.gara.net/idatzia/20061025/art186010.php La Policía sospecha que fue ETA quien robó anteayer 350 pistolas en Nimes] ("The police suspect that it was ETA who stole 350 guns yesterday in Nîmes"), ''Gara'', {{Nowrap|25 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a series of warnings made by ETA such as the one of 23 September, when masked ETA militants declared that the group would "keep taking up arms" until achieving "independence and socialism in the Basque country",&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/09/24/espana/1159091695.html El Mundo] {{Nowrap|24 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were regarded by some as a way to increase pressure on the talks, by others as a tactic to reinforce ETA's position in the negotiations.

Finally, on [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing|30 December 2006 ETA detonated a van bomb]] after three confusing warning calls, in a parking building at the [[Madrid]] Barajas international airport. The explosion caused the collapse of the building and killed two Ecuadorian immigrants who were napping inside their cars in the parking building.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}}

In January 2008, ETA stated that its call for independence is similar to that of the [[Kosovo status process|Kosovo status]] and [[Scottish independence|Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_id=46703 News – ETA to follow Kosovo example] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501175528/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_id=46703 |date=1 May 2009 }}.

In the week of 8 September 2008, two Basque political parties were banned by a Spanish court for their secretive links to ETA. In another case in the same week, 21 people were convicted whose work on behalf of ETA prisoners actually belied secretive links to the armed separatists themselves.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} ETA reacted to these actions by placing three major car bombs in less than 24 hours in northern Spain.

In April 2009 [[Jurdan Martitegi]] was arrested, making him the fourth consecutive ETA military chief to be captured within a single year, an unprecedented police record, further weakening the group.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Violence surged in the middle of 2009, with several ETA attacks leaving three people dead and dozens injured around Spain.

The Basque newspaper ''[[Gara]]'' published an article that suggested that ETA member Jon Anza could have been killed and buried by Spanish police in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Altuna|first=Iñaki|title=El refugiado donostiarra Jon Anza está desaparecido desde el pasado 18 de abril|url=http://www.gara.net/paperezkoa/20090516/137467/es/El-refugiado-donostiarra-Jon-Anza-esta-desaparecido-desde-pasado-18-abril|accessdate=20 October 2011|newspaper=Gara|date=16 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central prosecutor in the French town of Bayonne, Anne Kayanakis, announced, as the official version, that the autopsy carried out on the body of Jon Anza – a suspected member of the armed Basque group ETA, missing since April 2009 – revealed no signs of having been beaten, wounded or shot, which should rule out any suspicions that he died from unnatural causes.&lt;ref name="eitb.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=CP reports verdict of death by natural causes in case of Anza |url=http://www.eitb.com/news/politics/detail/377714/cp-reports-verdict-death-natural-causes-case-anza/ |access-date=5 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728103543/http://www.eitb.com/news/politics/detail/377714/cp-reports-verdict-death-natural-causes-case-anza/# |archive-date=28 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, that very magistrate denied the demand of the family asking for the presence of a family doctor during the autopsy. After this, Jon Anza's family members asked for a second autopsy to be carried out.&lt;ref name="gara.net"&gt;{{cite web|title= Autopsy carried out without family doctor |url=http://www.gara.net/azkenak/03/188405/es/Concluye-autopsia-Jon-Anza-sin-presencia-forense-confianza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Spain raised its terror alert after warning that ETA could be planning major attacks or high-profile kidnappings during Spain's European Union presidency. The next day, after being asked by the opposition, [[Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba]] said that warning was part of a strategy.

====2010 ceasefire====

On 5 September 2010, ETA declared a new ceasefire, its third, after two previous ceasefires were ended by the group. A spokesperson speaking on a video announcing the ceasefire said the group wished to use "peaceful, democratic means" to achieve its aims, though it was not specified whether the ceasefire was considered permanent by the group. ETA claimed that it had made the decision to initiate a ceasefire several months prior to the announcement. In part of the video, the spokesperson said that the group was "prepared today as yesterday to agree to the minimum democratic conditions necessary to put in motion a democratic process, if the Spanish government is willing."&lt;ref name="bbc 5 sep"/&gt;

The announcement was met with a mixed reaction; Basque nationalist politicians responded positively, and said that the Spanish and international governments should do the same, while the Spanish interior counselor of Basque, Rodolfo Ares, said that the commitment did not go far enough. He said that he considered ETA's statement "absolutely insufficient" because it did not commit to a complete termination of what Ares considered "terrorist activity" by the group.&lt;ref name="bbc 5 sep"/&gt;

====2011 permanent ceasefire and cessation of armed activity====

[[File:Konferentzia.ogv|thumb|400px|The final declaration of the [[Donostia-San Sebastián International Peace Conference]] (17 October 2011) led to an announcement of cessation of armed activity by ETA.]]

The day after the ceasefire, in a contribution piece to the ''New York Times'', Tony Blair indicated that lessons in dealing with paramilitary separatist groups can be learned from the way in which the Spanish administration handled ETA. Blair wrote, "governments must firmly defend themselves, their principles and their people against terrorists. This requires good police and intelligence work as well as political determination. [However], firm security pressure on terrorists must be coupled with offering them a way out when they realize that they cannot win by violence. Terrorist groups are rarely defeated by military means alone".&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Blair, Tony. "A Basque Peace." The New York Times: Opinion Pages 21 October 2011. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/opinion/22iht-edblair22,1.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair also suggested that Spain will need to discuss weapon decommissioning, peace strategies, reparations for victims, and security with ETA, as Britain has discussed with the [[Provisional IRA]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

ETA has declared ceasefires many times before, most significantly in 1999 and 2006, but the Spanish government and media outlets expressed particularly hopeful opinions regarding the permanence of this proclamation. Spanish premier [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] described the move as "a victory for democracy, law and reason".&lt;ref name=BBC20111020/&gt; Additionally, the effort of security and intelligence forces in Spain and France are cited by politicians as the primary instruments responsible for the weakening of ETA.&lt;ref&gt;Euronews.

Less optimistically, Spanish Prime Minister [[Mariano Rajoy]] of the center-right [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] expressed the need to push for the full dissolution of ETA.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt; The People's Party has emphasized the obligation of the state to refuse negotiations with separatist movements since former Prime Minister [[José María Aznar]] was in office.

"Ending with ETA?: Elusive Peace in the Basque Country." Washington, D.C.: United States Institute for Peace, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in preparation for his party’s manifesto, on 30 October 2011, Rajoy declared that the People's Party would not negotiate with ETA under threats of violence nor announcements of the group’s termination, but would instead focus party efforts on remembering and honoring victims of separatist violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_32500.shtml|title=“Mariano Rajoy Says the PP Will Not Talk to ETA”.

ETA, for its part, issued a statement endorsing the [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|2017 Catalan independence referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;The communiqué published in ''[[Gara]]'' read that "the Spanish state is a prison for the people, and this is shown by denying the national identity of the Catalan countries.

==Victims, tactics and attacks==
===Victims===
ETA's targets expanded from military or police-related personnel and their families, to a wider array, which included the following:{{Clarify|date=April 2009}}

[[File:Txema Agirre Plaza placa.jpg|thumb|Flowers and a plate remember [[Ertzaina]] officer José "Txema" Agirre, shot dead by ETA gunmen in 1997 while protecting the [[Guggenheim Bilbao Museum]] (visible in the background)]]

* Spanish military and police personnel, active duty or retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Terrorist Group Profiles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55BZmIJ9xd8C&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=30 January 2011|date=1 August 1989|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-56806-864-0|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barracks of the [[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] also provide housing for their families, thus, attacks on the barracks have also resulted in deaths of relatives, including children. As the regional police ([[Ertzaintza]] in the Basque Country and [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] in Catalonia) took a greater role in combating ETA, they were added to their list of targets.
* Businessmen (such as [[Javier Ybarra Bergé|Javier Ybarra]], [[Joxe Mari Korta]] or [[Ignacio Uria Mendizabal]]):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ETA/asesina/empresario/nacionalista/elpepiesp/20081204elpepinac_2/Tes ETA asesina a un empresario nacionalista · ELPAÍS.com].

Refusal to pay has been punished with assassinations, kidnappings for ransom or bombings of their business.
* Prison officers such as [[José Antonio Ortega Lara]].
* Elected parliamentarians, city councillors and ex-councillors, politicians in general: most prominently [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], killed in 1973). Dozens of politicians belonging to the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) and [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) were assassinated or maimed. Some Basque nationalist politicians from the PNV party, such as [[Juan Mari Atutxa]], also received threats. Hundreds of politicians in Spain required a constant bodyguard service. Bodyguards are contingent victims as well. In 2005 ETA announced that it would no longer "target" elected politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/20/spain.dalefuchs|work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Anger and doubts greet promise by Eta not to target Spanish politicians|first=Dale|last=Fuchs|date=20 June 2005|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, ETA killed ex-council member [[Isaías Carrasco]] in [[Mondragón|Mondragon/Arrasate]] on 7 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/08/spain?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews|work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Spain cancels election rallies after murder|first=Paul|last=Hamilos|date=8 March 2008|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* University professors who publicly expressed ideas that countered armed Basque separatism: such as [[Manuel Broseta]] or [[Francisco Tomás y Valiente]].

* Journalists: some of these professionals began to be labeled by ETA as targets starting with the killing of journalist [[José Luis López de la Calle]], assassinated in May 2000.
* Economic targets: a wide array of private or public property considered valuable assets of Spain, especially railroads, tourist sites, industries, or malls.
* Exceptionally, ETA also assassinated former ETA members such as [[María Dolores Katarain]] as a reprisal for having left the group.&lt;ref name = "hizrqw"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/701371.stm|work=BBC News  |title=Spanish cinema breaks ETA taboo|date=4 April 2000|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tactics===
ETA's tactics included:
* Direct attacks: killing by shooting the victim in the [[nape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1350358.stm|work=BBC News  |title=European press review|date=25 May 2001|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/10/09/spain.eta/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/19/spain.nikkiknewstub|work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Eta to end attacks on elected politicians|first=Nikki|last=Knewstub|date=19 June 2005|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bombings (often with [[car bomb]]s). When the bombs targeted individuals for assassination they were often surreptitiously rigged in the victim's car. The detonating systems varied. They were rarely manually ignited but instead, for example, wired so the bomb would explode on ignition or when the car went over a set speed limit. Sometimes the bomb was placed inside a stolen car with false plates, parked along the route of the objective, and the explosive remotely activated when the target passed by (e.g. V.I.P. cars, police patrols or military vehicles).

These bombs sometimes killed family members of ETA's target victim and bystanders. When the bombs were large car-bombs seeking to produce large damage and terror, they were generally announced by one or more telephone calls made to newspapers speaking in the name of ETA. Charities (usually [[Detente Y Ayuda]]—DYA) were also used to announce the threat if the bomb was in a populated area. The type of explosives used in these attacks were initially [[Goma-2]] or self-produced [[ammonal]]. After a number of successful robberies in France, ETA began using [[Titadyne]].
* [[shell (projectile)|Shells]]: hand-made [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] (the ''Jo ta ke'' model)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larazon.es/9918/noticia/Espa%F1a/ETA_retoma_el_uso_de_las_granadas_%ABJotake%BB_para_atentar_contra_cuarteles La Razón Digital – ETA retoma el uso de las granadas «Jotake» para atentar contra cuarteles].

Their lack of precision was probably the reason their use was discontinued.
* Anonymous threats: often delivered in the Basque Country by placards or graffiti. Such threats forced many people into hiding or into exile from the Basque Country, and were used to prevent people from freely expressing political ideas other than Basque nationalist ones.
* [[Extortion]] or blackmail: called by ETA a "revolutionary tax", demanding money from a business owner in the Basque Country or elsewhere in Spain, under threats to him and his family, up to and including death threats. Occasionally, some French Basques were threatened in this manner, such as footballer [[Bixente Lizarazu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/internationals/eta-tries-to-justify-tax-on-lizarazu-688316.html|work=The Independent |location=London |title=ETA tries to justify 'tax' on Lizarazu|date=21 March 2001|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETA moves the extorted funds to accounts in [[Liechtenstein]] and other fiscal havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/bank-accounts-linked-to-eta-are-frozen-in-liechtenstein-802730.html|work=The Independent |location=London |title=Bank accounts linked to Eta are frozen in Liechtenstein|first=Elizabeth|last=Nash|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to French judiciary sources, ETA exacts an estimated 900,000 euros a year in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elconfidencial.com/cache/2008/02/19/28_recauda_anualmente_900000_segun_policia_francesa.html ETA recauda anualmente 900.000 €, según la Policía francesa]. elConfidencial.com. Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kidnapping: often as a punishment for failing to pay the blackmail known as "revolutionary tax", but was also used to try to force the government to free ETA prisoners under the threat of killing the kidnapped, as in the kidnapping and subsequent execution of [[Miguel Angel Blanco]]. ETA often hid the kidnapped in underground chambers without windows, called ''[[zulos]]'', of very reduced dimensions for extended periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/fotogaleria//9-1/ El zulo de Aldaya y Delclaux – Los secuestros de ETA – ELPAÍS.com].

* Robbery: ETA members also stole weapons, explosives, machines for license plates and vehicles.

===Attacks===
{{Main article|List of ETA attacks}}

==Activity==
With its attacks against what they consider "enemies of the Basque people", ETA has killed over 820 people since 1968 to date, including more than 340 civilians.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14191335 Basque terrorism: Dying spasms]. The Economist (6 August 2009). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It has maimed hundreds more&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com"/&gt; and kidnapped dozens.

Its ability to inflict violence has declined steadily since the group was at its strongest during the late 1970s and 1980 (when it killed 92 people in a single year).&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt; After decreasing peaks in the fatal casualties in 1987 and 1991, 2000 remains to date as the last year when ETA killed more than 20 in a single year. Since 2002 to date,{{When|date=April 2017}} the yearly number of ETA's fatal casualties has been reduced to single digits.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

Similarly, over the 1990s and, especially, during the 2000s (decade), fluid cooperation between the French and Spanish police, state-of-the-art tracking devices and techniques and, apparently, police [[mole (espionage)|infiltration]]&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/europe/20eta.html|work=The New York Times|title=Spain Hails Arrest of Man Seen as ETA Leader|first=Victoria|last=Burnett|date=20 April 2009|access-date=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have allowed increasingly repeating blows to ETA's leadership and structure (between May 2008 and April 2009 no less than four consecutive "military chiefs" were arrested&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;).

ETA operates mainly in Spain, particularly in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Navarre]], and (to a lesser degree) Madrid, Barcelona, and the tourist areas of the Spanish Mediterranean coast. To date, about 65% of ETA's killings have been committed in the Basque Country, followed by [[Madrid (autonomous community)|Madrid]] with roughly 15%. Navarre and [[Catalonia]] also register significant numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mir.es/DGRIS/Terrorismo_de_ETA/ultimas_victimas/p12b-esp.htm : Últimas víctimas mortales Cuadros Estadísticos- ???plantilla_home.title??? :] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915224606/http://www.mir.es/DGRIS/Terrorismo_de_ETA/ultimas_victimas/p12b-esp.htm |date=15 September 2010 }}. Mir.es (30 July 2009). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actions in France usually consist of assaults on arsenals or military industries in order to steal weapons or explosives; these are usually stored in large quantities in hide-outs located in the French Basque Country rather than Spain. The French judge [[Laurence Le Vert]] has been threatened by ETA and a plot arguably aiming to assassinate her was unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/037/article_15042.asp RFI – Question basque – Paris, cible du terrorisme basque ?]. Rfi.fr (28 August 2002). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Only very rarely have ETA members engaged in shootings with the French [[Gendarmerie]]. This has often occurred mainly when members of the group were confronted at checkpoints.

In spite of this, ETA killed in France on 1 December 2007, two Spanish [[Guardia Civil|Civil Guards]] on counter-terrorist surveillance duties in [[Capbreton]], Landes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7129002.stm Europe | 'Eta attack' kills second officer]. BBC News (5 December 2007). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been its first killing after it ended its 2006 declaration of "permanent ceasefire" and the first killing committed by ETA in France of a Spanish police agent ever since 1976, when they kidnapped, tortured and assassinated two Spanish inspectors in [[Hendaye]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ETA/rompe/baraja/suelo/frances/elpepunac/20071202elpepinac_7/Tes ETA rompe la baraja en suelo francés · ELPAÍS.com]. Elpais.com. Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===
More recently, 2007 police reports point out that, after the serious blows suffered by ETA and its political counterparts during the 2000s (decade), its budget would have been adjusted to 2,000,000 euros annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elimparcial.es/contenido/1589.html El Imparcial: Noticias: ETA maneja un presupuesto de dos millones de euros al ańo]. Elimparcial.es (25 January 2008). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ETA used robbery as a means of financing its activities in its early days, it has since been accused both of arms trafficking and of benefiting economically from its political counterpart Batasuna. [[Extortion]] remains ETA's main source of funds.

==Basque nationalist context==
ETA is considered to form part of what is informally known as the [[Basque National Liberation Movement]], a movement born much after ETA's creation. This loose term refers to a range of political organizations that are ideologically akin, comprising several distinct organizations that promote a type of [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalism that is often referred to by the Basque-language term ''Ezker [[Abertzale]]a'' (Nationalist Left). Other groups typically considered to belong to this independentist movement are: the political party [[Batasuna]], the nationalist youth organization [[Segi (organization)|Segi]], the labour union [[Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak]] (LAB), and [[Askatasuna]] among others. There are often strong interconnections between these groups, double or even triple membership are not infrequent.&lt;ref name = "jvjtfe"/&gt;

There are Basque nationalist parties with similar goals as those of ETA (namely, independence) but who openly reject their violent means. They are: [[EAJ-PNV]], [[Eusko Alkartasuna]], [[Aralar Party|Aralar]] and, in the [[French Basque country]], [[Abertzaleen Batasuna]]. In addition, a number of left-wing parties, such as [[United Left (Spain)|Ezker Batua]], [[Batzarre]] and some sectors of the [[EAJ-PNV]] party, also support self-determination but are not in favour of independence.

==French role==
Historically, members of ETA have taken refuge in France, particularly the [[French Basque Country]]. The leadership have typically chosen to live in France for security reasons, where police pressure is much less than in Spain.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/1386545/Payback-for-Eta-in-the-Pays-Basque.html|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Payback for Eta in the Pays Basque|first=Isambard|last=Wilkinson|date=2 March 2002|access-date=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, ETA's tactical approach had been to downplay the issue of independence of the French Basque country so as to get French acquiescence for their activities. The [[French government]] quietly tolerated the group, especially during [[Francoist Spain|Franco's regime]], when ETA members could face the death penalty in Spain. In the 1980s, the advent of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación|GAL]] still hindered [[counter-terrorist]] cooperation between France and Spain, with the French government considering ETA a Spanish domestic problem. At the time, ETA members often travelled between the two countries using the French sanctuary as a base of operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20080926-spain-basque-separatism-batasuna-eta Spain looks to France for help against Basque separatists]. France24 (26 September 2008). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the disbanding of the GAL, the French government changed its position on the matter and in the 1990s initiated the ongoing period of active cooperation with the Spanish government against ETA, including fast-track transfers of detainees to Spanish tribunals that are regarded as fully compliant with [[European Union]] legislation on human rights and the legal representation of detainees. Virtually all of the highest ranks within ETA –including their successive "military", "political" or finances chiefs – have been captured in French territory, from where they had been plotting their activities after having crossed the border from Spain.

In response to the new situation, ETA carried out attacks against French policemen and made threats to some French judges and prosecutors. This implied a change from the group's previous low-profile in the French Basque Country, which successive ETA leaders had used to discreetly manage their activities in Spain.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==Government response==
ETA considers its prisoners [[political prisoner]]s. Until 2003,&lt;ref&gt;''ETA pide el tercer grado para sus presos'' [[Libertad Digital]], 5 October 2003, quoted in {{cite web|url= http://www.bastaya.org/actualidad/Violencia/InformeTorturas/Ladispersiondelospresosdeeta.pdf |title=La dispersión de los presos de ETA }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(47.2&amp;nbsp;KB)}} (p. 9), a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] in the [[¡Basta Ya!]] site.&lt;/ref&gt; ETA consequently forbade them to ask penal authorities for progression to ''tercer grado'' (a form of [[open prison]] that allows single-day or weekend [[furlough]]s) or parole. Before that date, those who did so were menaced and expelled from the group. Some were assassinated by ETA for leaving the group and going through reinsertion programs.&lt;ref name = "hizrqw"/&gt;

The Spanish Government passed the ''Ley de Partidos Políticos''. This is a law barring political parties that support violence and do not condemn terrorist actions or are involved with terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="Ley 6/2002"&gt;[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo6-2002.html Ley Orgánica 6/2002, de 27 de junio, de Partidos Políticos]. Noticias.juridicas.com (21 January 2011). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The law resulted in the banning of [[Herri Batasuna]] and its successor parties unless they explicitly condemned terrorist actions and, at times, imprisoning or trying some of its leaders who have been indicted for cooperation with ETA.

Judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] has initiated a judicial procedure (coded as ''18/98''), aimed towards the support structure of ETA. This procedure started in 1998 with the preventive closure of the newspaper ''[[Egin (newspaper)|Egin]]'' (and its associated radio-station ''Egin Irratia''), accused of being linked to ETA, and temporary imprisoning the editor of its "investigative unit", [[Pepe Rei]], under similar accusations. In August 1999 Judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] authorized the reopening of the newspaper and the radio, but they could not reopen due to economic difficulties.

Judicial procedure 18/98 has many ramifications, including the following:

* A trial against a little-known organization called ''[[Xaki]]'', acquitted in 2001 as the "international network" of ETA.
* A trial against the youths' movement ''[[Jarrai]]''-''Haika''-''Segi'', accused of contributing to street violence in an organized form and in connivance with ETA.
* Another trial against [[Pepe Rei]] and his new investigation magazine ''Ardi Beltza'' (''Black Sheep''). The magazine was also closed down.
* A trial against the political organization ''[[Ekin]]'' (''Action''), accused of promoting [[civil disobedience]].
* A trial against the organization ''[[Joxemi Zumalabe Fundazioa]]'', which was once again accused of promoting civil disobedience.
* A trial against the prisoner support movement ''[[Amnistiaren Aldeko Komiteak]]''.&lt;!-- Isn't it Batzordeak? --&gt;
* A trial against [[Batasuna]] and the ''[[Herriko Tabernak]]'' (''people's taverns''), accused of acting as a network of meeting centres for members and supporters of ETA. Batasuna was outlawed in all forms. Most taverns continue working normally as their ownership is not directly linked to Batasuna.
* A trial against the league of Basque-language academies [[Alfabetatze Euskalduntze Koordinakundea|AEK]]. The case was dropped in 2001.
* Another trial against ''Ekin'', accusing [[Iker Casnova]] of managing the finances of ETA.
* A trial against the association of Basque municipalities [[Udalbiltza]].
* The closing of the newspaper [[Euskaldunon Egunkaria]] in 2003 and the imprisonment and trial of its editor, [[Martxelo Otamendi]], due to links with ETA accounting and fundraising, and other journalists (some of whom reported torture).&lt;ref name="Otamendi"&gt;[http://www.englishpen.org/writersintranslation/magazineofliteratureintranslat/basquecountry/martxelootamendi/ Testimony by Martxelo Otamendi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218152327/http://www.englishpen.org/writersintranslation/magazineofliteratureintranslat/basquecountry/martxelootamendi/ |date=18 February 2012 }} at the [[Universal Forum of Cultures]], Barcelona (May 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2007|alt=As of June 2007}}, indicted members of the youth movements Haika, Segi and Jarrai have been found guilty (January 2007) of a crime of [[connivance]] with terrorism. Most of the other trials are still under process.

On Tuesday 20 May 2008, leading ETA figures were arrested in [[Bordeaux]], France. [[Francisco Javier López Peña]], also known as 'Thierry,' had been on the run for twenty years before his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10511726 ETA terror leader's arrest hailed as 'heavy blow'], NZ Herald, 22 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A final total of arrests brought in six people, including ETA members and supporters, including the ex-Mayor of [[Andoain]], [[José Antonio Barandiarán]], who is rumoured to have led police to 'Thierry'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1809271,00.html|work=Time|title=The Fall of Spain's Most Wanted|date=24 May 2008|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Interior Ministry claimed the relevance of the arrests would come in time with the investigation. Furthermore, the Interior Minister said that those members of ETA now arrested had ordered the latest attacks, and that senior ETA member Francisco Javier López Peña was "not just another arrest because he is, in all probability, the man who has most political and military weight in the terrorist group."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_16604.shtml Spanish government speaks of the significance of latest ETA arrests in France] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705135907/http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_16604.shtml |date=5 July 2008 }}.

After Lopez Pena's arrest, along with the [[Basque referendum, 2008|Basque referendum]] being put on hold, police work has been on the rise. On 22 July 2008, Spanish police dismantled the most active cell of ETA by detaining nine suspected members of the group. [[Interior Minister]] [[Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba]] said about the arrests: "We can't say this is the only ETA unit but it was the most active, most dynamic and of course the most wanted one."&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5imMCVAth4FzitUIFYwyNXdvxPeYw AFP: Spanish police dismantle ETA's 'most active' cell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707132912/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5imMCVAth4FzitUIFYwyNXdvxPeYw |date=7 July 2009 }}.

===International response===
The [[European Union]] and the [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|United States]] list ETA as a [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist group]] in their relevant watch lists. ETA has been a Proscribed Organisation in the [[United Kingdom]] under the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] since 29 March 2001.&lt;ref name="legislation2000"/&gt; The [[Canada|Canadian Parliament]] listed ETA as a terrorist group in 2003.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

France and Spain have often shown co-operation in the fight against ETA, after France's lack of co-operation during the Franco era. In late 2007, two Spanish guards were shot to death in France when on a joint operation with their French counterparts. Furthermore, in May 2008, the arrests of four people in Bordeaux led to a major breakthrough against ETA, according to the Spanish Interior Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10511726|title=NZherald.co.nz|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2008, as ETA activity increased, France increased its pressure on ETA by arresting more ETA suspects, including [[Unai Fano]], [[María Lizarraga]] on 23 September, and [[Esteban Murillo Zubiri]] in [[Bidarrain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=France arrests third alleged ETA terrorist in two weeks|url=http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_18290.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004221323/http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_18290.shtml|archive-date=4 October 2008|date=4 October 2008|deadurl = yes }}.

French judicial authorities had already ordered that he be held in prison on remand.

Spain has also sought cooperation from the United Kingdom in dealing with ETA-IRA ties. In November 2008, this came to light after [[Iñaki de Juana Chaos]], whose release from prison was canceled on appeal, had moved to [[Belfast]]. He was thought to be staying at an [[Provisional IRA|IRA]] safe house while being sought by the Spanish authorities. Interpol notified the judge, Eloy Velasco, that he was in either the Republic of Ireland or [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5150232.ece|work=The Times |location=London |title=Eta terrorist Inaki de Juana Chaos to give himself up at Belfast court|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Engage''' is an [[anti-racist]] organisation which publishes materials in opposition to [[antisemitism]], primarily in [[UK]] academic institutions. The group is made up of [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] academics who oppose [[boycott]]s of [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3406627,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation describes its mission as follows: "'''Engage''' challenges [[new antisemitism|left and liberal antisemitism]] in the [[labour movement]], in our universities and in public life more generally. Antisemitism here, manifests itself mainly as [[anti-Zionism]]. We are a resource for the monitoring and the critique of left and liberal antisemitism." Engage was founded in response to the decision of the [[Association of University Teachers]] to participate in a cultural and [[academic boycott of Israel]].

The founders of Engage are [[David Hirsh]], who teaches at [[Goldsmiths College]] at the [[University of London]], and Jon Pike, who teaches at the [[Open University]]. Hirsh had written about left and liberal antisemitism for the [[Guardian Unlimited]] blog. Well-known supporters have included the late academic and blogger [[Norman Geras]].

==Positions==
According to its founding statement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engageonline.org.uk/archives/index.php?id=14 Original founding statement]&lt;/ref&gt; the organisation
* opposes Israel’s occupation of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. ''Engage'' is in favour of the foundation of a [[Palestinian state]] [[Two-state solution|alongside the state of Israel]].
* opposes the idea of an academic or cultural boycott of Israel.
* aims to encourage, facilitate and publicise positive links between Israeli, Palestinian, British and global academia.
* stands up against antisemitism in universities, in unions and in students unions. In ''Engage'''s opinion, opposing the sometimes brutal actions of the Israeli government and army is not antisemitic, but certain expressions of criticism of Israel constitute antisemitism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14553">{{International relations theory sidebar|realism}}
The '''English School''' of [[international relations theory]] (sometimes also referred to as '''liberal realism''', the '''International Society school''' or the '''British institutionalists''') maintains that there is a 'society of states' at the international level, despite the condition of [[Anarchy in international relations|anarchy]] (that is, the lack of a global ruler or world state). The English school stands for the conviction that ideas, rather than simply material capabilities, shape the conduct of international politics, and therefore deserve analysis and critique. In this sense it is similar to [[Constructivism_(international_relations)|constructivism]], though the English School has its roots more in world history, international law and political theory, and is more open to normative approaches than is generally the case with constructivism.

==Overview==

===International system, international society, world society===

====International system====
The classical English school starts with the realist assumption of an international ''system'' that forms as soon as two or more states have a sufficient amount of interaction. It underlines the English school tradition of realism and ''Machtpolitik'' (power politics) and puts international anarchy at the centre of International Relations Theory.&lt;ref name="Buzan, 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buzan|first=Barry|title=From international to world society? English school theory and the social structure of globalisation|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-511-18590-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hedley Bull defined the international system as being formed " when two or more have sufficient contact between them, and has sufficient impact on one another's decisions to cause them to behave as part of a whole.

====International society====
[[Hedley Bull]], however, argued that states share a certain common interest (usually the "fear of unrestricted violence"&lt;ref name="Bull, 1977"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bull|first=Hedley|title=The Anarchical Society: A Study of Order in World Politics|year=1977|publisher=Macmillan|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that lead to the development of a certain set of "rules". He thus defined an international society as existent when:

{{quote|…a group of states (or, more generally, a group of independent political communities) which not merely form a system, in the sense that the behaviour of each is a necessary factor in the calculations of the others, but also have established by dialogue and consent common rules and institutions for the conduct of their relations, and recognise their common interest in maintaining these arrangements.&lt;ref name="Bull &amp; Watson, 1984"&gt;{{harvnb|Bull|Watson|1984|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Bull's view, any type of society needed to have rules about restraints on the use of force, about the sanctity of agreements, and about property rights. Without elements of these three there would be no society.

These ''rules'' are expressed in a set of institutions that capture the normative structure of any international society. In the classical English School these were: [[war]], the [[great powers]], [[diplomacy]], the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]], and [[international law]], especially in the mutual recognition of [[sovereignty]] by states. To these could be added: territoriality, nationalism, the market, and human equality. Since these rules are not legally binding and there is no ordering institutions, speaking of [[Norm (philosophy)|norms]] would probably be more appropriate. States that respect these basic rules form an international society. Brown and Ainley therefore define the international society as a "norm-governed relationship whose members accept that they have at least limited responsibilities towards one another and the society as a whole".&lt;ref name="Brown, 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Chris|title=Understanding International Relations|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0-230-21311-1|pages=48–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; States thus follow their interests, but not at all costs.&lt;ref name="Dunne, 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Tim|title=The Social Construction of International Society|journal=European Journal of International Relations|year=1995|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way of looking at this would be through Adam Watson's term 'raison de système', a counterpoint to 'raison d'état', and defined as 'the idea that it pays to make the system work'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Watson, The Evolution of International Society, 1992, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are differing accounts, within the school, concerning the evolution of those ideas, some (like [[Martin Wight]]) arguing their origins can be found in the remnants of medieval conceptions of ''societas Christiana'', and others such as [[Hedley Bull]], in the concerns of sovereign states to safeguard and promote basic goals, especially their survival. Most English School understandings of international society blend these two together, maintaining that the contemporary society of states is partly the product of a common civilization - the Christian world of medieval Europe, and before that, the Roman Empire - and partly that of a kind of [[John Locke|Lockean]] contract.

====World society====
Based on a [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian understanding of the world, the concept of world society takes the global population as a whole as basis for a global identity. However, Buzan also argued that the concept of World Society was the "Cinderella concept of English school theory", as it received almost no conceptual development.&lt;ref name="Buzan, 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buzan|first=Barry|title=From international to world society? English school theory and the social structure of globalisation|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-511-18590-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reexamination of traditional approaches===
A great deal of the English School of thought concerns itself with the examination of traditional international theory, casting it — as [[Martin Wight]] did in his 1950s-era lectures at the [[London School of Economics]] — into three divisions (called by [[Barry Buzan]] as the English School's triad, based on Wight's ''three traditions''):
# Realist (or [[Hobbesian]], after [[Thomas Hobbes]]) and thus the concept of international system
# Rationalist (or Grotian, after [[Hugo Grotius]]), representing the international society
# Revolutionist (or Kantian, after [[Immanuel Kant]]) representing world society.

In broad terms, the English School itself has supported the rationalist or Grotian tradition, seeking a middle way (or ''via media'') between the '[[power politics]]' of realism and the '[[utopianism]]' of revolutionism.

Later Wight changed his triad into a four-part division by adding [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Martin Wight |first=Martin |last=Wight |title=Four Seminal Thinkers in International Theory: [[Machiavelli]], Grotius, Kant, and Mazzini |publisher=Oxford University Press |editor1-first=Gabriele |editor1-last=Wight |editor2-first=Brian |editor2-last=Porter |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English School is largely a [[constructivism (international relations)|constructivist]] theory, emphasizing the non-deterministic nature of [[anarchy in international relations|anarchy]] in international affairs that also draws on [[functionalism in international relations|functionalism]] and [[political realism|realism]].

===Internal divisions===
The English School is often understood to be split into two main wings, named after two categories described by Hedley Bull:
* The '''pluralists''' argue that the diversity of humankind - their differing political and religious views, ethnic and linguistic traditions, and so on - is best contained within a society that allows for the greatest possible independence for states, which can, in their forms of government, express those differing conceptions of the 'good life'. This position is expressed most forcefully by the Canadian academic Robert Jackson, especially in ''The Global Covenant'' (2001).
* The '''solidarists''', by contrast, argue that the society of states should do more to promote the causes of human rights and, perhaps, emancipation - as opposed to the rights of states to political independence and non-intervention in their internal affairs. This position may be located in the work on humanitarian intervention by, amongst others, Nicholas Wheeler, in ''Saving Strangers'' (2000).

There are, however, further divisions within the school. The most obvious is that between those scholars who acquire that the school's approach should be historical and normative (such as Robert Jackson or Tim Dunne) and those who think it can be methodologically 'pluralist', making use of 'positivist' approaches to the field (like Barry Buzan and Richard Little).&lt;ref&gt;Pruszynski, S. (2013) ''What are the core elements of the international society approach to international relations?'' University of Southampton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affinities to others===
The English School does have affinities:
* The pluralists have drawn from the classical '[[political realism]]' of [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]
* The pluralists have also been influence by the underpinnings of [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]'s [[Christian realism (international relations)|Christian realism]]
* The solidarists have drawn from [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] writers, such as [[Stanley Hoffmann]]

Contemporary English School writers draw from a variety of sources:
* from structural '[[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]]' of [[Kenneth Waltz]], in the case of [[Barry Buzan]];
* from [[Constructivism in international relations|social constructivism]] of [[Alexander Wendt]], see [[Tim Dunne]];
* from '[[critical theorists]]', in that of [[Andrew Linklater]]; and
* even from the '[[post-structuralism]]' of [[Michel Foucault]], in the case of [[James Der Derian]].

==History==
The 'English-ness' of the school is questionable - many of its most prominent members are not English - and its intellectual origins are disputed. One view (that of [[Hidemi Suganami]]) is that its roots lie in the work of pioneering inter-war scholars like the South African [[Charles Manning]], the founding professor of the Department of International Relations at the [[London School of Economics]]. Others (especially [[Tim Dunne]] and Brunello Vigezzi) have located them in the work of the [[British committee on the theory of international politics]], a group created in 1959 under the chairmanship of the Cambridge historian [[Herbert Butterfield]], with financial aid from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Both positions acknowledge the central role played by the theorists [[Martin Wight]], [[Hedley Bull]] (an Australian teaching at the [[London School of Economics]]) and [[R J Vincent]].

The name 'English School' was first coined by Roy Jones in an article published in the ''[[Review of International Studies]]'' in 1981, entitled "The English school - a case for closure". Some other descriptions - notably that of 'British institutionalists' (Hidemi Suganami) - have been suggested, but are not generally used. Throughout the development of the theory, the name became widely accepted, not least because it was developed almost exclusively at the London School of Economics, Cambridge and Oxford University.

The '''Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1995''' (previously [[bill (law)|bill]] no. 15 of 1995) is an [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|amendment]] of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] which removed the constitutional prohibition on [[divorce]], and allowed for the dissolution of a marriage provided specified conditions were satisfied. It was approved by [[referendum]] on 24 November 1995 and signed into law on 17 June 1996.

==Background==
The Constitution of Ireland adopted in 1937 included a constitutional ban on divorce. A previous bill to amend this provision proposed by the [[Fine Gael]]–[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] government of [[Garret FitzGerald]], the [[Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1986|Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1986]], was rejected in a referendum by 63.5% to 36.5%.

In the intervening years, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989 allowed for [[legal separation]] to be recognised by a court. The government made other legislative changes to address the issues identified in that referendum campaign, including the social welfare and pension rights of divorced spouses, which were copper fastened, and the abolition of the status of illegitimacy to remove any distinction between the rights of the children of first and subsequent unions.&lt;ref name="it57963"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ten-year-wait-is-finally-over-for-those-who-campaigned-for-divorce-1.57963|title=Ten year wait is finally over for those who campaigned for divorce|last=Coulter|first=Carol|date=13 June 1996|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before its collapse, the [[Government of the 26th Dáil|1989–92 government]] published a [[white paper]] on marriage breakdown, which proposed "to have a referendum on divorce after a full debate on the complex issues involved and following the enactment of other legislative proposals in the area of family law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Department of Justice (Ireland)|Department of Justice]]|title=Marital breakdown: a review and proposed changes  |url=http://opac.oireachtas.ie/AWData/Library3/Library2/DL040836.pdf#page=11|series=Official publications|volume=Pl.9104|date=1 October 1992|publisher=Stationery Office|location=Dublin|accessdate=11 December 2013|page=9, §1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1995, the [[Fine Gael]]–[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]]–[[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] government of [[John Bruton]] proposed a new amendment to allow for divorce in specified circumstances.

==Changes to the text==
The Fifteenth Amendment deleted the following Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution:
{{quote frame|2º No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.}}
and substituted that subsection with the following:
{{quote frame|2º A Court designated by law may grant a dissolution of marriage where, but only where, it is satisfied that –
:i. at the date of the institution of the proceedings, the spouses have lived apart from one another for a period of, or periods amounting to, at least four years during the previous five years,
:ii. there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the spouses,
:iii. such provision as the Court considers proper having regard to the circumstances exists or will be made for the spouses, any children of either or both of them and any other person prescribed by law, and
:iv. any further conditions prescribed by law are complied with.}}

==Oireachtas Debate==
The Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill 1995 was proposed in the Dáil on 27 October 1995 by [[Minister for Labour|Minister for Equality and Law Reform]] [[Mervyn Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1995-09-27/10/|title=Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 1995: Second Stage.|date=27 October 1995|access-date=21 May 2018|publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas}}&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment was proposed by [[Helen Keogh]] on behalf of the [[Progressive Democrats]] which would have allowed for legislation generally, without the restrictions proposed in the government's proposal:
{{quote frame|2º Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution, a Court designated by law may grant a dissolution of marriage where it is satisfied that all the conditions prescribed by law are complied with.}}
This amendment was rejected and the Bill passed final stages by the Dáil without division on 11 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1995-10-11/10/|title=Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 1995: Fifth Stage.|date=11 October 1995|access-date=21 May 2018|publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed by the Seanad on 18 October and proceed to a referendum on 24 November 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/seanad/1995-10-18/6/|title=Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 1995: Committee and Final Stages.|date=11 October 1995|access-date=21 May 2018|publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
The Catholic Church was strongly against the amendment, but stated that Catholics could vote for the amendment in good conscience, and that it would not be a sin to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/world/premier-urges-irish-to-vote-for-legalizing-of-divorce.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|title=Premier Urges Irish to Vote For Legalizing Of Divorce|work=New York Times|date=20 November 1995|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '± Yes 1986' column shows the percentage point change in the Yes vote compared to the [[Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1986|Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill]] on a similar proposal rejected in a referendum in 1986.

==Court challenge==
During the referendum, government funds were used to advertise in favour of a 'Yes' vote. One week before the referendum, [[Patricia McKenna]], a [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] MEP, successfully lodged a complaint against the government with the Supreme Court, and the advertising stopped.&lt;ref name="it57963" /&gt; This Supreme Court decision led to legislation that would establish a [[Referendum Commission]] for each referendum, commencing with the [[Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighteenth Amendment]] in 1998.

The [[returning officer]] submitted a provisional certificate of the result of the referendum in the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] as required by the Referendum Act 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0012/sec0040.html|title=Referendum Act, 1994, Section 40|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="it58604"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/result-of-divorce-referendum-is-formally-signed-by-high-court-1.58604|title=Result of divorce referendum is formally signed by High Court|last=Newman|first=Christine|date=15 June 1996|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to ''[[The Irish Times]]'', "the polls taken at the time showed that, if anything, the end of the advertising campaign coincided with a halt in the slide of support for divorce".&lt;ref name="it58604" /&gt; Because of the use of Government funds for one side of the campaign, a petition against the result was lodged by [[Des Hanafin]], a [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Seanad Éireann|Senator]] and chairman of the [[Pro Life Campaign]], which was dismissed by the High Court on 9 February 1996.&lt;ref name="it58604" /&gt;&lt;ref name="it57963" /&gt; Hanafin appealed to the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]], which in June upheld the High Court decision. The High Court then endorsed the provisional certificate on 14 June 1996.&lt;ref name="it58604" /&gt; President [[Mary Robinson]] signed the amendment bill into law three days later.

==Subsequent legislation==
Before the referendum, a draft Family Law (Divorce) Bill was published to illustrate how the Constitutional provisions would be implemented if the amendment were passed. Once the Constitutional amendment came into force, the divorce bill was [[second reading|introduced]] in the Oireachtas on 27 June 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1996-06-27/3/|title=Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996: Second Stage.|date=27 June 1996|work=Dáil Éireann debates|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[signed into law]] on 27 November 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0033/|title=Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave effect in [[primary legislation]] to the new Constitutional provisions.

The estate can vary from under ten to hundreds or even thousands of acres. The gentleman farmer can employ labourers and farm managers. The chief source of income for the gentleman farmer was derived not from any income that the landed property may generate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2884">'''Gunnysacking''' is when someone silently collects irritations and slights until "the last straw is placed on them" causing an overblown reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Dunne, ''Anger and Conflict Management'' (2003) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gunnysacking has been described as 'an alienating fight tactic in which a person saves up, or gunnysacks, grievances until the sack gets too heavy and bursts, and old hostilities pour out'.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Lamanna et al, ''marriages and Families'' (2006) p. 590&lt;/ref&gt; (A [[gunny sack]] is a cloth container used for carrying or storing things).

==Stonewalling==

Gunnysacking is used in [[conflict resolution]], referring to the act of "storing up" grievances acquired in the course of a relationship without systematically resolving them.  'When grievances simmer, they build and build in intensity until there's an explosion; when they are aired and worked out, it takes the pressure off'.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1995) p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

The related practice of '[[stonewalling]] may encourage one's partner to engage in "gunnysacking" – keeping one's grievances secret while tossing them into an imaginary gunnysack, which grows heavier and heavier over time'.&lt;ref&gt;Lamanna, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kitchen-sinking==

The term may alternately refer to the act of verbally bringing up past grievances (i.e. dumping the contents of the sack) during the process of trying to resolve some present problem in a relationship – 'gunnysacking or bringing in everything but the kitchen sink'.&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Guerrero et al. ''Close Encounters'' (2010) p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;  In which case, gunnysacking (as a tactic) has the dual effect of raising additional problems (in what is typically already a volatile situation) and presenting an obstacle to dealing with the current issues.  Once the practice becomes a familiar pattern used by one person in a relationship, other persons may avoid reporting new issues or problems for the sake of avoiding a repeat of the gunnysacking behavior.
"Couples who engage in patterns of negative reciprocity, such as joint gunnysacking and sequences of complaints followed by countercomplaints, report less relational satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, 'constructive fighting aims at resolving specific problems that are happening ''now'' – not at gunnysacking'.&lt;ref&gt;Lamanna, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1800">'''HDcctv''' ([[High-definition television|High Definition]] [[Closed Circuit Television]]) is an open industrial standard for transmitting uncompressed high-definition [[digital video]] over [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[coaxial cable]] links for [[video surveillance]] applications. HDcctv uses the [[SMPTE]] [[HD-SDI]] protocol and can transmit [[720p]] or [[1080p]] video over at least 100 m of [[RG59]] cable.

The HDcctv Alliance is a non-profit, global consortium that develops and promotes the HDcctv standard. Advantages over [[IP video surveillance]] are claimed to include low [[latency (engineering)|latency]] and zero configuration.

Devices incorporating HDcctv interfaces include video cameras, [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s and repeaters.

==  No need for existing cabling changes ==

One of the main advantages of HDcctv is that it does not require significant modification for existing CCTV systems designed for analog cameras originally using composite [[NTSC]] or [[PAL]] video, for which extensive cabling and labor was invested for installation of the original analog system.

Since the coaxial cables originally used for the analog system have significant unused data spectrum available, it is a simple matter to just replace the camera and the recorder to obtain nearly seven times higher detail (1920x1080 vs 640x480) than the original camera system. Since coaxial cable is capable of carrying a hundred [[HDTV]] channels simultaneously, there is still more unused data capacity available for future resolution improvements.

The '''International Disability and Development Consortium (IDDC)''' is a global [[consortium]] of [[disability]] and development related organisations.  The aim of IDDC is to promote [[inclusive development]] internationally, with a special focus on promoting [[human rights]] for all disabled people living in economically poor communities in lower and middle-income countries.

IDDC's work is primarily led by task groups where members collaborate to exchange views and ideas, and agree upon common strategies and positions.  These task groups are thus fundamental to the implementation of the IDDC objectives.

== History ==
In 1993, the Italian organization, Associazione Italiana Amici di Raoul Follereau, had been discussing the need for collaboration with the [[World Health Organization]]'s Rehabilitation Unit – now the Disability and Rehabilitation Team – and decided to call a meeting of European NGOs who were involved in disability and [[leprosy]] programmes in countries in the South.  Eleven NGOs attended the first meeting and at a subsequent meeting in Oslo in 1994, the International Disability Consortium (IDC) was established with the aim of sharing information and expertise and to collaborate so that their work would be more effective and efficient.

== Membership ==
IDDC Currently has 23 full members:

'''International Media Support''' (IMS) is an international [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] located in Copenhagen, Denmark, working to support local media in countries affected by [[armed conflict]], human insecurity and political transition. It works in 41 countries to improve professional journalism and help media personnel to operate under difficult circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.menassat.com/?q=en/en-media-support-organizations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-m-s.dk/page/introduction-ims |accessdate=July 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719125022/http://www.i-m-s.dk/page/introduction-ims |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group works to promote [[freedom of expression]] and [[freedom of the press]], in order to reduce conflict, strengthen [[democracy]] and bring about dialogue.

IMS was established in 2001 in the wake of violence and killings in [[Rwanda]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]]. In the 1990s, IMS members believe these and other conflicts saw media being manipulated and used as a tool to fuel violent conflict. IMS was set up in response, with an aim to helping local media working in conflict-affected areas to remain operative and professional. The group works in partnership with local media and media support organisations, nationally and internationally, to identify and react rapidly and flexibly to the needs of local media. This can include help with media laws and media reforms, skills training, [[technical support]] and the protection of [[journalists]]. The group advocates media rights and monitors for violations, supporting community, exiled and [[alternative media]], and works with media professionals within and across borders to promote knowledge exchange and cooperation.

The group aims to undertake its work through cooperation and collaboration, seeking to encourage maximum coordination with existing local and international initiatives.

'''Kosynierzy''' (singular: kosynier; sometimes translated as scythe-bearers or scythemen, from Polish ''kosa'', scythe) is the term for soldiers (often [[peasant]]s) armed with [[war scythe]]s. First appearing in the [[Kościuszko Insurrection]] of 1794, kosynierzy quickly became one of the symbols of the [[history of Poland (1795–1918)|struggle for Polish independence]].

==History==

The term comes from the Polish language. In Poland the kosynierzy formations are best remembered for their decisive role in the [[Battle of Racławice]], 1794, during the [[Kościuszko Insurrection]].&lt;ref name="HannMagocsi2005-119"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKI1996"/&gt; Through this battle, well known in Poland, and because of Kościuszko's influence and pro-peasant stance, the kosynierzy became one of the symbols of the fight for Polish independence, as well as a symbol of [[self-identification]] of the peasantry with the [[Poland|Polish nation]].&lt;ref name="LERSKI1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HannMagocsi2005-125"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jakubowska2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Storozynski2009"/&gt; One of the kosynierzy, [[Wojciech Bartosz Głowacki]], recognized for his bravery in the battle of Racławice, became one of the most famous Polish peasants, a symbol in his own right, attracting what some described as a cult following.&lt;ref name="HannMagocsi2005-119"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKI1996B"/&gt;

The tradition of the kosynierzy would be commemorated through peasant-staged battle reenactments, statues, poems, and plays.&lt;ref name="HannMagocsi2005-122"/&gt;

During the Kościuszko Uprising, most of the peasants who joined the kosynierzy units came from the [[Kraków]] region, inspired by the [[Proclamation of Połaniec]] that Kościuszko issued there. Local quartermasters issued a simple uniform to them, based on the Kraków regional peasant garb (white [[sukmana]] dress, plus a cheap military [[rogatywka]] cap in red). This garb soon became traditionally associated with the kosynierzy.&lt;ref name="wielecki"/&gt;

Despite the popular myth, the kosynierzy were only a support formation in Kościuszko's forces during the uprising; they formed a majority of troops in only one infantry regiment.&lt;ref name="maciejewski"/&gt;

Kosynierzy units also fought in the [[November Uprising]] of 1830–31, the [[Kraków Uprising]] of 1846, the [[January Uprising]] of 1863–64, and possibly as late as during the [[German invasion of Poland]] of 1939.&lt;ref name="encyklopedia"/&gt; Though less remembered, the kosynierzy's participation in the November and January Uprisings were likely more significant than during the Kośiuszko Insurrection.&lt;ref name="uzbrojeniu"/&gt;

The '''land reform in SA''' promises "land restitution" that aims to empower farm workers (who now have the opportunity to become farmers) and reduce inequality.&lt;ref name="KeeferKnack2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Keefer| first1=Philip| last2=Knack| first2=Stephen| journal=Public Choice| volume=111|issue=1/2|year=2002|pages=127–154|issn=0048-5829|doi=10.1023/A:1015168000336|title=Polarization, Politics and Property Rights: Links Between Inequality and Growth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed to allow previously unemployed people to participate in the economy and better the country's economic growth.&lt;ref name="Torstensson1994"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Torstensson| first1=Johan| title=Property Rights and Economic Growth: An Empirical Study| journal=Kyklos| volume=47| issue=2| year=1994|  pages=231–247|issn=0023-5962|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6435.1994.tb02257.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many South Africans and foreign commentators have also voiced alarm over the failure of the redistribution policy. Around 50% of farms are said to be failing,&lt;ref name="econ_Seed"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Seeds of change | author =  | work = The Economist | date = 20 June 2013 | accessdate = 2016-10-01 | url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2013/06/land-reform-south-africa | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and critics suggest that the ANC government's policy will be detrimental to the South African agricultural industry.

== The reform ==

The Land Reform Process focused on three areas: restitution, land tenure reform and land redistribution.&lt;ref name="Deininger, Klaus 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deininger|first1=Klaus|year=1999|title=Making Negotiated Land Reform Work: Initial Experience from Colombia, Brazil and South Africa|journal=World Development|volume=27|issue=4|pages=651–672|doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(99)00023-6|issn=0305-750X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoseleyMcCUSKER2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=William G.|last2=McCusker|first2=Brent|title=Fighting Fire with a Broken Teacup: A Comparative Analysis of South Africa's Land-Redistribution Program      |journal=Geographical Review| volume=98| issue=3| year=2010|pages=322–338|issn=0016-7428|doi=10.1111/j.1931-0846.2008.tb00304.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restitution, where the government compensates (monetary) individuals who had been forcefully removed, has been very unsuccessful and the policy has now shifted to redistribution with secure land tenure. Land tenure reform is a system of recognizing people's right to own land and therefore control of the land.

Redistribution is the most important component of land reform in South Africa.&lt;ref name=Lahiff2008 /&gt;  Initially, land was bought from its owners (willing seller) by the government (willing buyer) and redistributed, in order to maintain public confidence in the land market.&lt;ref name="Deininger, Klaus 1999"/&gt;

Although this system has worked in various countries in the world, in South Africa it has proved to be very difficult to implement. This is because many owners do not actually see the land they are purchasing and are not involved in the important decisions made at the beginning of the purchase and negotiation.

In 2000 the South African Government decided to review and change the redistribution and tenure process to a more decentralised and area based planning process. The idea is to have local integrated development plans in 47 districts. This will hopefully mean more community participation and more redistribution taking place, but there are also various concerns and challenges with this system too.&lt;ref name=Hall2008 /&gt;

These include the use of third parties, agents accredited by the state, and who are held accountable to the government. The result has been local land holding elites dominating the system in many of these areas. The government still hopes that with "improved identification and selection of beneficiaries, better planning of land and ultimately greater productivity of the land acquired..."&lt;ref name=Lahiff2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Lahiff|first= Edward|publisher=Program for Land and Agrarian Studies |title=Land Reform in South Africa: A status Report 2008 |date= 2008|pages=42|url=http://www.plaas.org.za/sites/default/files/publications-pdf/RR38_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the land reform process will begin moving faster.&lt;ref name=Hall2008&gt;{{citation|last=Hall|first= Ruth|title=Decentralization in South Africa's Land Redistribution.|work= Presentation to the PLAAS regional workshop on Land Reform from Below? Decentralization of Land Reform in Southern Africa. |publisher=Program for land and agrarian studies|location=Kopanong Conference Centre, Kempton Park, Johannesburg|date= 23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2006, the [[African National Congress|ANC]] government announced that it will start [[Nationalization|expropriating]] the land, although according to the country's chief land-claims commissioner, Tozi Gwanya, unlike Zimbabwe there will be compensation to those whose land is expropriated, "but it must be a just amount, not inflated sums."&lt;ref name="MG2006"&gt;{{Cite web|title=SA land expropriation to start soon |work=Mail &amp; Guardian Online |date=7 February 2006 |accessdate=2016-10-01 |archive-date=31 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331024038/http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=263484&amp;area=%2Fbreaking_news%2Fbreaking_news__national%2F |url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=263484&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/ |language= |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these moves towards decentralisation, these improved practices and government promises are not very evident. South Africa still remains hugely unequal, with black South Africans still dispossessed of land and many still homeless.  The challenge for the incumbent politicians is to improve the various bureaucratic processes, and find solutions to giving more South Africans secure land tenure.

In South Africa, the main model of Land Reforms that was implemented was based on the Market-led Agrarian Reform (MLAR) approach. Within the MLAR, the strategic partnership (SP) model was implemented in seven claimant communities in Levubu in the Limpopo province. The SP model was implemented between 2005–2008 that ended up in a fiasco leading to creation of conflict between several interested parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Basu|first = Soutrik|title = Community, Conflict and Land: Exploring the Strategic Partnership Model of South African Land Restitution|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1002/jid.3150|journal = Journal of International Development|pages = 733–748|doi = 10.1002/jid.3150|volume=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2010 the National Rural Youth Service Corps (NARYSEC) was launched by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform to provide and recruit rural youth specifically dependents of Military Veterans between the ages of 18–25  with skills development and to serve their communities by providing a 24-month training program at South African military bases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruraldevelopment.gov.za/about-us/narysec/283-narysec-infor/566-narysec-background#.WkEh_COxXqA&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2017 the ruling ANC-led government announced at their 54th National Conference that they will seek to amend Section 25 of the South African Constitution regarding property rights to implement ''land expropriation without compensation'' (EWC). At the conference a resolution was passed to grant ownership of traditional land to the respective communities, about 13% of the country, usually registered in trust like the [[Ingonyama Trust]] under the name of traditional leaders to the respective communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-12-21-ancdecides2017-land-expropriation-without-compensation-makes-grand-entrance/|title=#ANCdecides2017: Land expropriation without compensation makes grand entrance - Daily Maverick|first=Marianne|last=Merten|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the [[Parliament of South Africa]] passed a motion to review the property ownership clause of the constitution, to allow for the expropriation of land, in the public interest, without compensation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-02-27-historic-vote-land-expropriation-without-compensation-passed|title=First step to land expropriation without compensation|last=Pather|first=Ra'eesa|work=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=https://www.parliament.gov.za/press-releases/national-assembly-gives-constitution-review-committee-mandate-review-section-25-constitution|title=National Assembly gives the Constitution Review Committee mandate to review Section 25 of the Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Minutes of Proceedings of National Assembly.

In August 2018, the South African government began the process of taking two white-owned farmlands by filing papers seeking to acquire the farms via [[eminent domain]] for one-tenth of their estimated value, (which in one case is based on possible value when the farm is developed into an eco-estate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eybers|first=Johan|title=Dispute after state authorised expropriation of farm|newspaper=City Press|date=19 August 2018|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/state-takes-first-farm-20180818}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2017 government audit, 72 percent of the nation's private farmland is owned by white people, who make up 9 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/20/south-africa-begins-seizing-white-owned-farms/|title=South Africa begins seizing white-owned farms|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization Afriforum claim that 24% of South African land is owned by the state and 34,5% is owned by black people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afriforum.co.za/wp-content/uploads/AfriForum-Land-and-land-reform.pdf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future challenges==
Various researchers have identified various challenges facing land and agrarian reform in South Africa. The following are amongst the challenges as identified by {{harv |Hall|2004}} and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (2008):
* Willing seller-willing buyer principle: it takes a long time to negotiate land price with the current land owners;
* Claim disputes: it is a long process to mediate and resolve claim disputes (e.g. unresolved disputes between Makgoba Traditional Council and the Trust in the Limpopo Province, South Africa);
* Capacity: there is lack of institutional capacity for community legal entities (e.g. trust);
* Beneficiary selection: it is a lengthy process and time consuming process to select the rightful beneficiaries for land redistribution;
* Resettlement support: it requires enough resources and time to effectively facilitate post-resettlement support to new land owners;
* Monitoring and evaluation: there is lack of reliable monitoring system and evaluation thereof;
* Policy: there are gaps in the current policies which compromise effective implementation of land reform programme.
* Different political views: there is lack of common consensus among political parties on land reform debate.

Unresolved [[land claim]]s, which are largely rural claims, are mostly affected by a number of challenges such as:
* disputes with land owners on the validity of claims, land prices, settlement models and conditions;
* family or community dispute;
* conflict among traditional leaders, community, trust and beneficiaries
* boundaries disputes among traditional leaders;
* reluctance of other government departments and institutions to release state land;
* high land prices and disputes on land valuation;
* land price negotiations with current owners;
* lack of technical and financial support;
* mismanagement of resources;

As of 2016 the South African government has pumped more than R60bn into land reform projects since 1994. Despite this investment, the land reform programme has not stimulated development in the targeted rural areas. A report by the South African Government's [[Financial and Fiscal Commission]] shows that land reform as a mechanism for agricultural development and job creation has failed. A survey by the commission in [[Limpopo province]], [[KwaZulu-Natal]] and the [[Eastern Cape]] found that most land reform farms show little or no agricultural activity; the land reform beneficiaries earn little to no income, and the majority of these beneficiaries seek work on surrounding commercial farms instead of actively farming their own land. Where farming is taking place on land reform farms, these farms operate below their full agricultural potential and are mainly used for [[subsistence agriculture]]. On average, crop production had decreased by 79% since conversion to land reform. In the three provinces surveyed, job losses averaged 84%, with KwaZulu-Natal suffering a 94% job haemorrhage.

The deadliest [[1986 Damascus bombings|bombings]] were executed in Damascus and surrounding areas in 1986. The events caused 144 fatalities, and were blamed by the Syrian authorities upon Iraqi [[Ba'ath]]ist agents, though other alleged perpetrators, like the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], were proposed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10817">'''Ministry of Land Defence''' ({{lang-sv|Lantförsvarsdepartementet}}) was in a broad sense, one of the eight ministries, in which the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] administration was divided into.&lt;ref name="Westrin (1911), pp. 1099-1100"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://runeberg.org/nfbo/0584.html |editor-first1=Theodor |editor-last1=Westrin |title=Nordisk familjebok: konversationslexikon och realencyklopedi |year=1911 |publisher=Nordisk familjeboks förl. |volume=15 |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |id={{LIBRIS|8072220}} |pages=1099-1100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its head was called Minister of War. The Ministry of Land Defence Department was established on 16 May 1840 and was merged with the [[Ministry for Naval Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry for Naval Affairs]] into the newly established [[Ministry of Defence (Sweden)|Ministry of Defence]] on 30 June 1920.

==History==
The Ministry of Land Defence was established in connection with the ministry reform in 1840. The cases, previously handled by the War Office (''Krigsexpeditionen''), were now divided between the Ministry of Land Defence and the [[Ministry for Naval Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry for Naval Affairs]]. The Ministry of Land Defence's first cabinet meeting day was on 19 May 1840.&lt;ref name="Cavallie (1967), pp. 1-3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arkis2dok.ra.se/ra/1202/1202A.02_Lantf%C3%B6rsvar_Hemliga.pdf |publisher=[[National Archives of Sweden]] |title=Lantförsvarsdepartementet |trans-title=Ministry of Land Defence |location=Stockholm |first=James |last=Cavallie |pages=1-3 |date=September 1967 |access-date=2 May 2017 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Royal Decree concerning the distribution of cases between the ministries on 16 May 1840 ([[Swedish Code of Statutes|SFS]] 1840 No. 14), the following cases sorted under the Ministry of Land Defence:&lt;ref name="Cavallie (1967), pp. 1-3"/&gt;

Cases relating to the organization and maintenance of the land defence, as well as the staff, the disposition of funds and equipment to the land defence, the construction and maintenance of fortifications, educational institutions, church and medical affairs, pension and charity facilities for the land army and associated staff; the [[Allotment system]] and ''Roteringsverket'' for the army; questions about commanding land troops for service or use for the necessary public works; the care of homes and buildings of the land defence, and The Crown's additional insight into the use of artillery foundry (''styckebruk''), the rifle factories and the gunpowder manufacturing; questions concerning telegraph arrangements (the telegraphic arrangements here means the military [[Semaphore line|optical telegraph]]) in Sweden, with the exception of the individual needs of the [[Swedish Navy]]. In addition came the so-called Command Objectives (''Kommandomålen''), i.e. those matters of generally less importance which were determined by the king as [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces|Supreme Commander]] of Sweden's military force.&lt;ref name="Cavallie (1967), pp. 1-3"/&gt;

These cases were settled, in accordance with §15 of the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|Instrument of Government]] for the Ministry of Land Defence's concern, by the King, following presentation by the head of the Ministry of Land Defence, and in attendance only by him. The Command Objectives (''Kommandomålen'') mainly concerned the [[Swedish Army]]'s weapons exercises, schools, training courses, personnel accounts, service conditions, regulations, etc.&lt;ref name="Cavallie (1967), pp. 1-3"/&gt; During the period up to the issue of the renewed ministry statute in 1900, the ministry was liberated from some of the often complex cases relating to the gradual modifications of the [[allotment system]]. Following the decommissioning of the allotment system by the new army order in 1901, only the cases relating to its decommissioning remained. Until the Ministry of Land Defence's merging into the [[Ministry of Defence (Sweden)|Ministry of Defence]] in 1920, some significant changes in the ministry's area of affairs did not take place. In 1920, the ministry's all cases were transferred to the new ministry.&lt;ref name="Cavallie (1967), pp. 1-3"/&gt; For preparing these cases, the head of the ministry had a department of the [[King in Council (Sweden)|Royal Majesty]]'s Chancery (''Kunglig Majestäts kansli''), which consisted of one permanent undersecretary, two deputy directors (''kansliråd'') and directors (''byråchef''), three office secretaries, one registrar and an unspecified number of extra officials (assistants).&lt;ref name="Westrin (1911), pp. 1099-1100"/&gt;

Under the Ministry of Land Defence sorted government agencies such as: the Military Office (''Kommandoexpedition'') of the Ministry of Land Defence and the [[Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration]]. The ministry also belonged to the army with its ''Generalitet'',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Generalitet'' or ''Generalitetet'', the collective term for all the generals in an army. Also the term for (and an administrative corps) for all generals in active service and in the reserve in the Swedish Army.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[General Staff (Sweden)|General Staff]], the regiments and the corps, the Commendant Staff (''Kommendantskapen''), the [[Royal Swedish Army Staff College]], the [[Artillery and Engineering College]], the [[Military Academy Karlberg|Royal Military Academy]], the [[Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences]] and other military education and training institutions, the subordinate ordnance, ammunition and rifle stores of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration, the investigative offices in [[Stockholm]] and at [[Military Academy Karlberg|Karlsborg]], the Fortification Commissariat (''Fästningsintendenturen'') in Stockholm, the State Warehouse Agency (''Magasinsstaten'') in Stockholm with the Crown Bakery (''Kronobageriet''), the [[Bofors Carl Gustaf|Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori]], [[Marieberg, Stockholm|Marieberg]]'s Ammunition Factory, Fortification Treasurers and custodians, the Potassium Nitrate Maker's School (''Salpetersjuderiskolan''), the Discipline Company at Karlsborg, the garrison hospitals in Stockholm and at Karlsborg, as well as all the foundations of the land defence.&lt;ref name="Westrin (1885), pp. 703-704"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://runeberg.org/nfai/0358.html |editor-first1=Theodor |editor-last1=Westrin |title=Nordisk familjebok: konversationslexikon och realencyklopedi |year=1885 |publisher=Nordisk familjeboks förl. |volume=9 |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |id={{LIBRIS|8072220}} |pages=703-704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the act on the state ministries on 19 June 1919, the Ministry of Land Defence and the  Ministry for Naval Affairs were merged into a new ministry, the Ministry of Defence, from 1 July 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arkis2dok.ra.se/ra/1203/1203A_Sj%C3%B6f%C3%B6rsvar.pdf |publisher=[[National Archives of Sweden]] |title=Sjöförsvarsdepartementet |trans-title=Ministry for Naval Affairs |first=James |last=Cavallie |format=PDF |location=Stockholm |date=May 1967 |page=2 |access-date=3 May 2017 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
During the years 1840-1851, the Ministry of Land Defence was, like the [[Ministry for Naval Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry for Naval Affairs]], located in the ''Stenbockska palatset'' at [[Birger Jarls torg]] 4. During this time, however, the Military Office (''Kommandoexpeditionen'') was located in the so-called ''Preisiska huset'' at [[Drottninggatan]] 36. In 1851, the ministry moved to ''Mynthuset'' (the predecessor of the current ''Kanslihuset''), where it remained until 1920.&lt;ref name="Cavallie (1967), pp. 1-3"/&gt;

==Ministers==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3746">The '''National Warning System''' (NAWAS) is an automated telephone system used to convey warnings to [[United States]]-based federal, state and local governments, as well as the military and civilian population.&lt;ref name=fema&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/1550_2.pdf National Warning System Operations Manual] – [[FEMA]], 30 Mar 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The original mission of NAWAS was to warn of an imminent enemy attack or an actual accidental missile launch upon the United States.  NAWAS still supports this mission but the emphasis is on natural and technological disasters.&lt;ref name=fema /&gt; Organizations are able to disseminate and coordinate emergency alerts and warning messages through NAWAS and other public systems by means of the [[Integrated Public Alert and Warning System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fema.gov/integrated-public-alert-warning-system |title=Integrated Public Alert &amp; Warning System |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=September 18, 2018 |website=fema.gov |publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency |access-date=September 22, 2018 |quote=IPAWS provides public safety officials with an effective way to alert and warn the public about serious emergencies using the Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio, and other public alerting systems from a single interface.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NAWAS is operated and fully funded by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA).

Today, the system consists of what is essentially a 2200+ telephone [[Party line (telephony)|party line]]. The phone instruments are designed to provide protection for lightning strikes so they may be used during storms. The interconnecting lines provide some protection by avoiding local telephone switches. This ensures they are available even when the local system is down or overloaded. NAWAS has major terminals at each state [[Emergency Operations Center]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.gallaudet.edu/emergency/nov05conference/Remarks/Bongers.asp Emergency Alert System Update] – Martin Bongers,Project Officer, Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)&lt;/ref&gt; and State Emergency Management Facility. Other secondary terminals include local emergency management agencies, [[National Weather Service]] field offices and [[Public-safety answering point]]s (PSAPs).

NAWAS is used to disseminate warning information concerning natural and technological disasters to approximately 2200 warning points throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and the Virgin Islands. This information includes acts of terrorism including [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]] (WMD) after aircraft incidents/accidents, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, nuclear incidents/accidents, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, tsunamis and winter storms/blizzards.  NAWAS allows issuance of warnings to all stations nationwide or to selected stations as dictated by the situation. 

When the NAWAS is not being used for emergency traffic/tests, State and local government personnel are encouraged to use it for official business.&lt;ref name=fema /&gt;

'''Paul Ralph Ehrlich''' (born May 29, 1932) is an [[United States|American]] biologist, best known for his warnings about the consequences of [[population growth]] and limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Mieszkowski | first=Katharine | url=http://www.salon.com/news/environment/feature/2008/09/17/population_control | title=Do we need population control? | publisher=Salon.com | date=2008-09-17 | accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the Bing Professor of [[Population Studies]] of the Department of Biology of [[Stanford University]] and president of Stanford's Center for [[Conservation biology|Conservation Biology]].

Ehrlich became well known for his controversial 1968 book ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', which asserted that the world's human population would soon increase to the point where mass starvation ensued.&lt;ref name=leaders/&gt;&lt;ref name="tierney1990"/&gt; Among the solutions he suggested in that book was [[population control]], to be used in his opinion if voluntary methods were to fail. Ehrlich has been criticized for his opinions; for example, [[Ronald Bailey]] termed Ehrlich an "irrepressible doomster".&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt; However, Carl Haub observed that Ehrlich's warnings had encouraged governments to change their policies to avert disaster.&lt;ref name=Haub/&gt; Ehrlich has acknowledged that some of what he predicted has not occurred, but maintains that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct, and that [[human overpopulation]] is a major problem.&lt;ref name=grist/&gt;

==Early life, education, and academic career==
[[File:Paul R Ehrlich.png|thumb|Ehrlich circa 2010]]
Ehrlich was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the son of William Ehrlich and Ruth (Rosenberg) Ehrlich,&lt;ref name=leaders&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oHYD-XUiSBEC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318| title=Leaders from the 1960s: A Biographical Sourcebook of American Activism | publisher=Greenwood Press, 1994 | page=318 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[liberal Judaism|liberal]] [[American Jews|Jews]].&lt;ref name=Stoll&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=bjooDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260| title=Inherit the Holy Mountain: Religion and the Rise of American Environmentalism | publisher=Oxford University Press, 2015 | page=260 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a shirt salesman, his mother a [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] scholar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PAUL EHRLICH | url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2009/2747139.htm | work=Radio National | publisher=ABC | accessdate=4 March 2013 | author=Phillip Adams | author2=Kate MacDonald | date=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and public school teacher.&lt;ref name=leaders/&gt; Ehrlich's mother's Reform-Jewish German ancestors arrived in the United States in the 1840s, and his paternal grandparents immigrated there later from the Galician and Romanian part of the Austrian Empire.&lt;ref name=Stoll/&gt; During his childhood his family moved to [[Maplewood, New Jersey]], where he attended high school.&lt;ref name=leaders/&gt;

Ehrlich earned a bachelor's degree in [[zoology]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1953, an M.A. from the [[University of Kansas]] in 1955, and a Ph.D. from the University of Kansas in 1957, supervised by the prominent [[bee]] researcher [[Charles Duncan Michener]] (the title of his dissertation: "The Morphology, Phylogeny and Higher Classification of the Butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea)").&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Paul R., "[http://hdl.handle.net/1808/7853 The Morphology, Phylogeny and Higher Classification of the Butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea)]," Ph.D. dissertation, University of Kansas, May 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; During his studies he participated with surveys of [[insect]]s in the areas of the [[Bering Sea]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Arctic]], and then with a [[National Institutes of Health]] fellowship, investigated the genetics and behavior of parasitic [[mite]]s. In 1959 he joined the faculty at [[Stanford University]], being promoted to professor of [[biology]] in 1966. By training he is an [[entomologist]] specializing in [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies); he published a major paper about the evolution of plants and insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ehrlich | first1=Paul R. | last2=Raven | first2=Peter H. | year=1964 | title=Butterflies and Plants: A Study in Coevolution |  journal=Evolution | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=586–608 | doi=10.2307/2406212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lecture that Ehrlich gave on the topic of overpopulation at the [[Commonwealth Club of California]] was broadcast by radio in April 1967.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;{{cite web | title=Story: Paul Ehrlich, the Vindication of a Public Scholar. | url=http://spot.us/pitches/135-paul-ehrlich-the-vindication-of-a-public-scholar/story | work=Spot.us (first published by The Earth Island Journal) | publisher=American Public Media | accessdate=4 March 2013 | author=Tom Turner | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the lecture caused further publicity, and the suggestion from [[David Brower]] the executive director of the environmentalist [[Sierra Club]], and [[Ian Ballantine]] of [[Ballantine Books]] to write a book concerning the topic. Ehrlich and his wife, [[Anne Ehrlich]], collaborated on the book, ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', but the publisher insisted that a single author be credited.&lt;ref name="The Population Bomb Revisited"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Paul R. Ehrlich | author2=Anne H.

Although Ehrlich was not the first to warn about population issues&amp;nbsp;– concern had been widespread during the 1950s and 1960s&amp;nbsp;– his charismatic and media-savvy methods helped publicize the topic.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book | title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail&amp;nbsp;– and Why We Believe Them Anyway | author=Dan Gardner | publisher=McClelland and Stewart | year=2010 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings===

====''The Population Bomb'' (1968)====
The original edition of ''The Population Bomb'' began with this statement: "The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Population Bomb"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ehrlich, Paul R. | title=The Population Bomb | publisher=Ballantine Books | year=1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich argued that the human population was too great, and that while the extent of disaster could be mitigated, humanity could not prevent severe famines, the spread of disease, social unrest, and other negative consequences of overpopulation. By the end of the 1970s, this prediction proved to be incorrect. However, he continued to argue that societies must take strong action to decrease population growth in order to mitigate future disasters, both ecological and social.

In the book Ehrlich presented a number of "scenarios" detailing possible future events, some of which have been used as examples of errors in the years since. Of these scenarios, Ehrlich has said that although, "we clearly stated that they were not predictions and that 'we can be sure that none of them will come true as stated,’ (p.&amp;nbsp;72) – their failure to occur is often cited as a failure of prediction. In honesty, the scenarios were way off, especially in their timing (we underestimated the resilience of the world system). But they did deal with future issues that people in 1968 should have been thinking about." Ehrlich further states that he still endorses the main thesis of the book, and that its message is as apt now as it was in 1968.&lt;ref name="The Population Bomb Revisited" /&gt;

Ehrlich's opinions have evolved over time, and he has proposed different solutions to the [[Human overpopulation|problem of overpopulation]]. In ''Population Bomb'' he wrote, "We must have [[population control]] at home, hopefully through a system of incentives and penalties, but by compulsion if voluntary methods fail. We must use our political power to push other countries into programs which combine agricultural development and population control."&lt;ref name="Population Bomb" /&gt; Voluntary measures he has endorsed include the easiest possible availability of [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].  In 1967 he had expressed his belief that aid should only be given to those countries that were not considered to be "hopeless" to feed their own populations.&lt;ref name=lomborg&gt;{{cite book | last1=Lomborg | first1=Bjørn | title=[[The Skeptical Environmentalist|The skeptical environmentalist : measuring the real state of the world]] | date=2002 | publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press | location=Cambridge | isbn=978-0-521-01068-9 | page=350 | quote=In 1967 Paul Ehrlich predicted that the world was headed for massive starvation. In order to limit the extent of this, he believed – reasonably enough given his point of view – that aid should be given only to those countries that would have a chance to make it through. According to Ehrlich, India was not among them. We must "announce that we will no longer send emergency aid to countries such as India where sober analysis shows a hopeless imbalance between food production and population . . . Our inadequate aid ought to be reserved for those which can survive."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Population Explosion'' (1990)====
In their sequel to ''The Population Bomb'', the Ehrlichs wrote about how the world's growing population dwarfs the Earth's capacity to sustain current living standards. The book calls for action to confront population growth and the ensuing crisis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ehrlich | first1=Paul R. | last2=Ehrlich | first2=Anne H. | title=The population explosion | date=1990 | publisher=Hutchinson | location=London | isbn=0091745519 | pages=39–40 | url=http://www.ditext.com/ehrlich/title.html | accessdate=20 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote | When is an area overpopulated? When its population can't be maintained without rapidly depleting nonrenewable resources [39] (or converting renewable resources into nonrenewable ones) and without degrading the capacity of the environment to support the population. In short, if the long-term carrying capacity of an area is clearly being degraded by its current human occupants, that area is overpopulated.}}

====''Optimum Human Population Size'' (1994) ====
In this paper, the Ehrlichs discuss the [[optimum population|'optimal size' for human population]], given current technological realities. They refer to establishing "social policies to influence fertility rates."&lt;ref&gt;Daily, Gretchen C.; Ehrlich, Anne H. and Ehrlich, Paul R. ''[http://dieoff.org/page99.htm Optimum Human Population Size]''. Population and Environment: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies Volume 15, Number 6, July 1994 01994 Human Sciences Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul R. Ehrlich 2008.jpg|thumb|Ehrlich speaking in 2008]]

===After 2000===
During a 2004 interview, Ehrlich answered questions about the predictions he made in ''The Population Bomb''. He acknowledged that some of what he had published had not occurred, but reaffirmed his basic opinion that overpopulation is a major problem. He noted that, "Fifty-eight academies of science said that same thing in 1994, as did the world scientists' warning to humanity in the same year. My view has become depressingly mainline!"&lt;ref name=grist&gt;{{cite web | title=When Paul's Said and Done | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041115081108/http://www.grist.org/comments/interactivist/2004/08/09/ehrlich/index1.html | publisher=Grist Magazine | accessdate=24 Sep 2015 | author=Ehrlich, Paul | url=http://www.grist.org/comments/interactivist/2004/08/09/ehrlich/index1.html | archivedate=15 November 2004 | date=13 August 2004 |quote="Some things I predicted have not come to pass."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich also stated that 600 million people were very hungry, billions were under-nourished, and that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct.&lt;ref name=grist/&gt; Retrospectively, Ehrlich believes that ''The Population Bomb'' was "way too optimistic".&lt;ref name="turner" /&gt;

In a 2008 discussion hosted by the website ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', Paul Ehrlich has become more critical of the United States specifically, claiming that it should control its population and consumption as an example to the rest of the world. He has disavowed some of what he said in ''The Population Bomb''. He still thinks that governments should discourage people from having more than two children, suggesting, for example a greater tax rate for larger families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Salon.com | url=http://www.salon.com/2008/09/17/population_control/ | title=Do we need population control? | author=Katharine Mieszkowski  | date=17 Sep 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, as the world's population passed the seven billion mark Ehrlich has argued that the next two billion people on Earth would cause more damage than the previous two billion because we are now increasingly having to resort to using more marginal and environmentally damaging resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hall | first=Eleanor | title=Population analyst warns of catastrophe | url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2011/s3351962.htm | accessdate=31 October 2011 | newspaper=The World Today | date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, Ehrlich continues to perform policy research concerning population and resource issues, with an emphasis upon [[endangered species]], [[cultural evolution]], [[environmental ethics]], and the preservation of [[genetics|genetic]] resources. Along with Dr. Gretchen Daily, he has performed work in countryside [[biogeography]]; that is, the study of making human-disturbed areas hospitable to [[biodiversity]]. His research group at Stanford University examines extensively natural populations of the [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] (''Euphydryas editha bayensis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jrbp.stanford.edu/db/projects/project_display.php?project_id=80 | title=Longterm studies of the Bay checkerspot butterfly and feasibility of reintroduction | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902173022/http://jrbp.stanford.edu/db/projects/project_display.php?project_id=80 | archivedate=2006-09-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The population-related disasters Ehrlich predicted have largely failed to materialize, with population growth rates slowing and new food production technologies increasing the food supply faster than the population.&lt;ref name=Haberman&gt;{{cite web | last=Haberman | first=Clyde | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/us/the-unrealized-horrors-of-population-explosion.html | title=The Unrealized Horrors of Population Explosion | publisher=The New York Times | date=2015-05-31 | accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich endorses his general thesis that the human population is too large, posing a direct threat to human survival and the environment of the planet.&lt;ref name=Haberman/&gt;

=={{anchor | Critics}}Reception==
[[File:Wheat yields in Least Developed Countries.svg|thumb|280px|Wheat yields have grown rapidly in [[least developed countries]] since 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wheat yields are levelling off, even in some developing countries | url=http://environmentalresearchweb.org/cws/article/news/49901 | website=environmentalresearchweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Critics have disputed Ehrlich's main thesis about overpopulation and its effects on the environment and human society, and his solutions, as well as some of his specific predictions made since the late 1960s. One criticism concerns Ehrlich's allegedly alarmist and sensational statements and inaccurate "predictions". [[Ronald Bailey]] of ''[[Reason Magazine]]'' has termed him an "irrepressible doomster&amp;nbsp;... who, as far as I can tell, has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe."&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt; On the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970, he warned that "[i]n ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish."&lt;ref name=Reason&gt;{{cite web | title=Cracked Crystal Ball: Environmental Catastrophe Edition | url=http://reason.com/blog/2010/12/30/cracked-crystal-ball-environme | work=reason.com – Free minds and free markets | publisher=Reason Foundation | accessdate=4 March 2013 | author=Ronald Bailey | date=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news| title=Eight Botched Environmental Forecasts |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/12/30/botched-environmental-forecasts/ | date=December 30, 2010 | author=Maxim Lott | work=FOX News | accessdate=2015-10-31 | quote="Again, not totally accurate, but I never claimed to predict the future with full accuracy"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1971 speech, he predicted that: "By the year 2000 the [[United Kingdom]] will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people." "If I were a gambler," Professor Ehrlich concluded before boarding an airplane, " I would take even money that [[England]] will not exist in the year 2000."&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt;&lt;ref name=foxnews /&gt; When this scenario did not occur, he responded that "When you predict the future, you get things wrong. How wrong is another question. I would have lost if I had had taken the bet. However, if you [[Demographics of England|look closely at England]], what can I tell you? They're having all kinds of problems, just like everybody else."&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt; Ehrlich wrote in ''The Population Bomb'' that, "India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980."&lt;ref name="Population Bomb" /&gt;

Carl Haub of the [[Population Reference Bureau]] has replied that it was precisely the alarmist rhetoric that prevented the catastrophes of which Ehrlich warned. According to Haub "It makes no sense that Ehrlich is now criticized as being alarmist because his dire warnings did not, in the main, come true. But it was because of such warnings from Ehrlich and others that countries took action to avoid potential disaster."&lt;ref name=Haub&gt;{{cite web | author=Haub, Carl | title=In Defense of Paul Ehrlich | url=http://prbblog.org/?p=22 | date= 5 November 2008 | accessdate= 10 February 2011 | work=Behind the Numbers: The PRB blog on population, health, and the environment }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s and 70s when Ehrlich made his most alarming warnings, there was a widespread belief among experts that population growth presented an extremely serious threat to the future of human civilization, although differences existed regarding the severity of the situation, and how to decrease it.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonhardt&gt;{{cite news | last=Leonhardt | first=David | title=Lessons From a Famous Bet | url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/lessons-from-a-famous-bet/ | accessdate=24 October 2013 | newspaper=New York Times | date=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Felsoetold Wheat field, Hungary.jpg| thumb | left | 280px | A large increase in global [[Agricultural productivity|food production]] since the 1960s and a slowing of [[population growth]] have, within the current context of continued depletion of [[non-renewable resources]], averted the scale of food shortage, [[famine]] and catastrophe foretold by the Ehrlichs.]]

Dan Gardner argues that Ehrlich has been insufficiently forthright in acknowledging errors he made, while being intellectually dishonest or evasive in taking credit for things he claims he got "right". For example, he rarely acknowledges the mistakes he made in predicting material shortages, massive death tolls from starvation (as many as one billion in the publication ''Age of Affluence'') or regarding the disastrous effects on specific countries. Meanwhile, he is happy to claim credit for "predicting" the increase of [[AIDS]] or global warming. However, in the case of disease, Ehrlich had predicted the increase of a disease based on overcrowding, or the weakened immune systems of starving people, so it is "a stretch to see this as forecasting the emergence of AIDS in the 1980s." Similarly, global warming was one of the scenarios that Ehrlich described, so claiming credit for it, while disavowing responsibility for failed scenarios is a [[double standard]]. Gardner believes that Ehrlich is displaying classical signs of [[cognitive dissonance]], and that his failure to acknowledge obvious errors of his own judgement render his current thinking suspect.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

[[Barry Commoner]] has criticized Ehrlich's 1970 statement that "When you reach a point where you realize further efforts will be futile, you may as well look after yourself and your friends and enjoy what little time you have left. That point for me is 1972."&lt;ref name="Commoner"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | author= Barry Commoner | date=May 1972 | title=A Bulletin Dialogue: on "The Closing Circle"&amp;nbsp;— Response | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages=17–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner has criticized Ehrlich for endorsing the strategies proposed by William and Paul Paddock in their book ''[[Famine 1975!]]''. They had proposed a system of "triage" that would end food aid to "hopeless" countries such as India and Egypt. In ''Population Bomb'', Ehrlich suggests that "there is no rational choice except to adopt some form of the Paddocks' strategy as far as food distribution is concerned." Had this strategy been implemented for countries such as India and Egypt, which were reliant on food aid at that time, they would almost certainly have suffered famines.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; Instead, both Egypt and India have greatly increased their food production and now feed much larger populations without reliance on food aid.&lt;ref name="lomborg" /&gt;

===Left-wing critics===

Another group of critics, generally of the [[political left]], argues that Ehrlich emphasizes overpopulation too much as a problem in itself instead of distribution of resources.&lt;ref name="The Population Bomb Revisited" /&gt; [[Barry Commoner]] argued that Ehrlich emphasized overpopulation too much as the source of environmental problems, and that his proposed solutions were politically unacceptable because of the coercion that they implied, and because they would cost poor people disproportionately. He argued that technological, and above all social development would result in a natural decrease of both population growth and environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | author=Barry Commoner | date=May 1972 | title=A Bulletin Dialogue: on "The Closing Circle"&amp;nbsp;— Response | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages=17–56 | quote=Population control (as distinct from voluntary, self-initiated control of fertility), no matter how disguised, involves some measure of political repression, and would burden the poor nations with the social cost of a situation&amp;nbsp;— overpopulation&amp;nbsp;— which is the current outcome of their previous exploitation, as colonies, by the wealthy nations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich denies any type of racism, and has argued that if his policy ideas were implemented properly they would not be repressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Race Bomb | year=1978 | publisher=Ballantine Books | author=Paul Ehrlich | author2=Shirley Feldman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2018 interview with ''The Guardian'', Ehrlich advocated for an "unprecedented redistribution of wealth" in order to mitigate the problem of [[overconsumption]] of resources by the wealthy, but said "the rich who now run the global system – that hold the annual ‘world destroyer’ meetings in Davos – are unlikely to let it happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Carrington|first=Damian|date=March 22, 2018 |title=Paul Ehrlich: 'Collapse of civilisation is a near certainty within decades'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/22/collapse-civilisation-near-certain-decades-population-bomb-paul-ehrlich|work=[[The Guardian]] |location= |access-date=April 4, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simon–Ehrlich wager===
{{main | Simon–Ehrlich wager}}

[[Julian Simon]], a [[cornucopian]] [[economist]], argued that overpopulation is not a problem in itself, and that humanity will adapt to changing conditions. Simon argued that eventually human creativity will improve living standards, and that most resources were replaceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Resources, Population, Environment: An Oversupply of False Bad News | journal=Science | volume=208 | date=June 27, 1980 | pages=1431–1437 | issue=4451 | doi=10.1126/science.7384784 | pmid=7384784 | last1=Simon | first1=JL | jstor=1684670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon stated that over hundreds of years, the prices of virtually all commodities have decreased significantly and persistently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The End of Doom |author=[[Ronald Bailey]] |date=2015 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-1-250-05767-9 |pages=38, 59 |quote="...nearly all resources in the past were much more expensive than they are today"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich termed Simon the proponent of a "space-age cargo cult" of economists convinced that human creativity and ingenuity would create substitutes for scarce resources and reasserted the idea that population growth was outstripping the earth's supplies of food, fresh water and minerals.&lt;ref name="tierney1990"/&gt; This exchange resulted in the [[Simon–Ehrlich wager]], a bet about the trend of prices for resources during a ten-year period that was made with Simon in 1980.&lt;ref name="tierney1990"&gt;{{cite news | last=Tierney | first= John | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/magazine/betting-on-the-planet.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm | title= Betting on the Planet | work=The New York Times | date= December 2, 1990 | accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich was allowed to choose ten commodities that he predicted would become scarce and thus increase in price. Ehrlich chose mostly metals, and lost the bet, as their average price decreased by about 30% in the next 10 years. Simon and Ehrlich could not agree about the terms of a second bet.

===Ehrlich's response to critics===
Ehrlich has argued that humanity has simply deferred the disaster by the use of more intensive agricultural techniques, such as those introduced during the [[Green Revolution]]. Ehrlich claims that increasing populations and affluence are increasingly stressing the global environment, due to such factors as loss of [[biodiversity]], [[overfishing]], [[global warming]], [[urbanization]], chemical pollution and competition for raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Paul Ehrlich | author2=Anne Ehrlich | title=One with Nineveh:politics, consumption, and the human future | publisher=Island Press | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintains that due to growing global incomes, reducing consumption and human population is critical to protecting the environment and maintaining living standards, and that current rates of growth are still too great for a sustainable future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Paul R. Ehrlich: Saving Earth | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/12/opinion/la-oe-morrison-ehrlich-021211 | accessdate=4 March 2013 | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=12 February 2011 | author=Patt Morrison | quote=Consumption is equally important.

==Other activities==
Ehrlich was one of the initiators of the group [[Population Connection|Zero Population Growth]] (renamed Population Connection) in 1968, along with Richard Bowers and [[Charles Remington]]. In 1971, Ehrlich was elected to the [[Common Cause]] National Governing Board. He and his wife Anne were part of the board of advisers of the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] until 2003. He is currently a patron of [[Population Matters]], (formerly known as the Optimum Population Trust).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Population Matters Patron | url=http://www.populationmatters.org/about/people/patrons/ | website=www.populationmatters.org | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625195121/http://populationmatters.org/about/people/patrons/ | archivedate=2014-06-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with his concern about the impact of pollution and in response to a doctoral dissertation by his student Edward Goth III, Ehrlich wrote in 1977 that, “Fluorides have been shown to concentrate in food chains, and evidence suggesting a potential for significant ecological effects is accumulating.”&lt;ref&gt;Zelko F.  Optimizing nature: Invoking the “natural” in the struggle over water fluoridation. History of Science. 2018; 1–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ehrlich has spoken at conferences in Israel on the issue of [[desertification]]. He has argued that "True Zionists should have small families".&lt;ref name="haaretz"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/true-zionists-should-have-small-families-suggests-paul-ehrlich-40-years-after-writing-the-population-bomb.premium-1.483039 | title='True Zionists should have small families' suggests Paul Ehrlich, 40 years after writing 'The Population Bomb'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ehrlich has been married to [[Anne H. Ehrlich]] (born Anne Fitzhugh Howland, 1933) since December 1954; the two are parents to one child, Lisa Marie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://icte.umsl.edu/WEArecipients/ehrlich.html | title=Whitney R.

'''Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan'''  ({{IPAc-en|p|ɪər|s}}; [[Given name#Name at birth|né]] '''O'Meara'''; born 30 March 1965) is an English journalist and television presenter currently working on the [[ITV Breakfast]] programme ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]''. 

Morgan began his career in [[Fleet Street]] as a writer and editor for several [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] papers, including ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', ''[[News of the World]]'', and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''. In 1994, aged 29, he was appointed editor of the ''News of the World'' by [[Rupert Murdoch]], which made him the youngest editor of a British national newspaper in more than half a century.&lt;ref name="Davies1994"/&gt; He later edited the ''Daily Mirror'', and was in charge during the period that the paper was implicated in the [[News International phone hacking scandal|phone hacking scandal]]. In 2011 Morgan denied having ever hacked a phone or "to my knowledge published any story obtained from the hacking of a phone". In 2012 he was heavily criticised in the findings of the [[Leveson Inquiry]], when the chair [[Brian Leveson]] stated that comments made in Morgan's testimony about phone hacking were "utterly unpersuasive" and "clearly prove ... that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it".&lt;ref name="Mark Sweney"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sweney |first=Mark |date=30 November 2012 |title=Piers Morgan claims over phone hacking branded 'utterly unpersuasive' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/30/piers-morgan-phone-hacking-leveson-inquiry |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On television, he hosted ''[[Piers Morgan Live]]'' on [[CNN]] from 2011 to 2014, replacing ''[[Larry King Live]]'' in the timeslot following [[Larry King|King]]'s retirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39060518/ns/today-entertainment "Piers Morgan is Larry King's CNN replacement"], MSNBC, 8 September 2010; accessed 7 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Piers Morgan's CNN show cancelled after 3 years|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/piers-morgan-s-cnn-show-cancelled-after-3-years-1.2548831|accessdate=24 February 2014|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a judge on ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' and ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nudd|first=Tim|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20544255,00.html|title=Piers Morgan Leaving America's Got Talent|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Morgan won the seventh season of the US ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. Season 7)|Celebrity Apprentice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Caitlin |date=28 March 2008 |title=Relative unknown wins 'Celebrity Apprentice' |url=http://www.today.com/id/23838097/ns/today-entertainment/t/relative-unknown-wins-celebrity-apprentice |publisher=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, he presents ''[[Piers Morgan's Life Stories]]'' (since 2009) has presented ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=14 October 2015|title=Piers Morgan handed permanent role on Good Morning Britain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/13/piers-morgan-permanent-fixture-good-morning-britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/08/01/piers-morgan-has-been-replaced-on-good-morning-britain/1/?tse_id=INF_6f69916076e411e785e8bfcdfe5d7856|title=Piers Morgan has been replaced on Good Morning Britain|work=PinkNews|access-date=2017-08-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan has written eight books, including four volumes of memoirs.

==Early life==
Piers Morgan was born in 1965 in [[Newick]], [[Sussex]], England&lt;ref name="offaly"/&gt; as Piers Stefan O'Meara, the son of Vincent Eamonn O'Meara, an Irish dentist originally from [[County Offaly]],&lt;ref name="offaly"&gt;[http://www.offalyindependent.ie/news/roundup/articles/2011/01/21/4002777-first-barack-now-piers-morgan-is-offaly-conquering Piers Morgan reference to his father's background], Offalyindependent.ie (cached), 21 January 2011; accessed 7 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/44111/pages/10035|title=Notices Under The Trustee Act, 1925|publisher=The London Gazette|date=13 September 1966|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabrielle Georgina Sybille (née Oliver),&lt;ref name=cantoph&gt;{{cite web|url=http://website.lineone.net/~hstjw/p29.htm#i1071|first=Hugh|last=Wilding|title=Wildings &amp; Thurleys, Cantophers &amp; McConnells|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; who raised her son as a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].&lt;ref name=cantoph /&gt; With regard to his religious views, Morgan still identifies as a Catholic due to his mother's influence, and believes in an [[afterlife]], but does not "go to [[Sacrament of Penance|Confession]], probably because it would take me too long".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mance |first1=Henry |title=Piers Morgan on Trump, Twitter and the power of prayer |url=https://www.ft.com/content/eac296be-03fc-11e7-ace0-1ce02ef0def9 |accessdate=30 July 2018 |work=Financial Times |date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a brother, Jeremy, who is two years older.&lt;ref name="Naughton"/&gt;

==Press career==
===At the Murdoch titles (1988–1995)===
Morgan began to work as a freelance at ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' in 1988, at this point dropping his [[double-barrelled name]]. He told [[Hunter Davies]] in December 1994 that he was personally recruited  by ''Sun'' editor [[Kelvin MacKenzie]] to work on the newspaper's show business column "Bizarre", his first high-profile post.&lt;ref name="Davies1994"/&gt; Although he was not a fan of pop music, he was considered skilled at self-publicity and became the column's main writer. "I became the Friend of the Stars, a rampant egomaniac, pictured all the time with famous people – Madonna, Stallone, Bowie, Paul McCartney, hundreds of them. It was shameless, as they didn't know me from Adam", he told Davies.&lt;ref name="Davies1994"/&gt;

In January 1994, he became editor of the ''[[News of the World]]'' after being appointed to the job by [[Rupert Murdoch]]. Initially an acting editor, he was confirmed in the summer, becoming at 29 the youngest national newspaper editor in more than half a century.&lt;ref name="Davies1994"/&gt; He quickly gained notice for his prying, forthright style and lack of sympathy for celebrities' privacy, claiming that they could not manipulate the media to further their own ends without accepting the consequences of a two-way deal.

Morgan left this post in 1995 shortly after publishing photographs of [[Victoria Aitken|Catherine Victoria Lockwood]], then wife of [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer|Charles, Earl Spencer]], leaving an addictive disorders clinic in Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Rhys |date=12 May 1995 |title=Murdoch lashes editor shock |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/murdoch-lashes-editor-shock-1619121.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action ran against the editors' code of conduct,&lt;ref name="BBC2004"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3713857.stm "Profile: Piers Morgan"], BBC News, 14 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; a misdemeanour for which the [[Press Complaints Commission]] upheld a complaint against Morgan.&lt;ref name="BBC2004"/&gt; Murdoch was reported as having said that "the boy went too far"&lt;ref&gt;Ginny Dougary [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/books/article2451447.ece "Educating Piers"], ''The Times Magazine'', 7 April 2007. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publicly distanced himself from the story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/47847.stm "Earl Spencer loses privacy battle to Europe"], BBC News, 16 January 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Fearful of a privacy law action if he had not criticised one of his employees, Murdoch is said to have apologised to Morgan in private.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Watson and Martin Hickman  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lel9DjaPgqEC&amp;pg=PT30 ''Dial M for Murdoch: News Corporation and the Corruption of Britain''], London: Penguin, 2012, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Wallace [http://nymag.com/news/media/piers-morgan-2011-10/index1.html "Piers Morgan Isn’t Sleeping Well"], ''New York'' (magazine), 9 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident was reported to have contributed to Morgan's decision to leave for the ''Daily Mirror'' editorship.&lt;ref name="Summerskill"&gt;{{cite news |last=Summerskill |first=Ben |author-link=Ben Summerskill |date=1 September 2002 |title=Has Piers now got news for Ian? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/sep/01/pressandpublishing.uknews |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan's autobiography ''[[The Insider: The Private Diaries of a Scandalous Decade|The Insider]]'' states that he left the ''News of the World'' for the ''Mirror'' of his own choice. It asserts he was an admirer of former prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] for most of her period of office making the appointment surprising as the ''Mirror'' is a Labour supporting title.&lt;ref name="Naughton"/&gt;

===''Daily Mirror'' editor (1995–2004)===
As editor of the ''Daily Mirror'', Morgan was forced to apologise on television for the headline (rendered in upper case) "Achtung Surrender! For You Fritz Ze Euro Championship Is Over" on 25 June 1996, a day before [[England national football team|England]] met [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in a semi-final of the [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro '96]] football championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maguire |first=Kevin |author-link=Kevin Maguire (journalist) |date=25 February 2002 |title=The New Statesman Profile – Piers Morgan |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/142285 |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |location=London |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Byrne |first=Ciar |date=15 May 2004 |title=Piers Morgan: The man with no moral compass who found his destiny in a steadfast opposition to war |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/piers-morgan-the-man-with-no-moral-compass-who-found-his-destiny-in-a-steadfast-opposition-to-war-6169902.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Wilkes and Dominic Wing "The British Press and European Integration: 1948 to 1996", in David Baker, David Seawright (eds.)

Morgan was the subject of an investigation in 2000 after Suzy Jagger wrote an article for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' revealing that he had bought [[pound sterling|£]]20,000 worth of shares in the computer company [[Viglen]] soon before the ''Mirror'' 's "City Slickers" column tipped Viglen as a good buy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jagger |first=Suzy |title=Mirror editor saw his shares soar after paper tipped company |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/02/02/nmir02.html |deadurl=yes |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021122223139/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F2000%2F02%2F02%2Fnmir02.html |archivedate=22 November 2002 |accessdate=13 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan was found by the [[Press Complaints Commission]] to have breached the Code of Conduct on financial journalism, but kept his job.

I've always loved Jimmy Savile."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Piers Morgan: did he meet Jimmy Savile or didn't he?|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/piers-morgan-did-he-meet-jimmy-savile-or-didnt-he-8222958.html|work=London Evening Standard|date=23 October 2012|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the editor-at-large of the ''[[Mail Online]]'' website's US operation in September 2014 and Morgan writes several columns a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deans|first=Jason|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/30/piers-morgan-joins-mail-online|title=Piers Morgan joins Mail Online as US editor-at-large|work=The Guardian|date=30 September 2014|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also writes a weekly diary for the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' ''Event'' magazine, having also written one for its predecessor ''Live''.

==Television career==
Morgan's career expanded into television presenting before he left the ''Daily Mirror''. He presented a three-part television documentary series for the [[BBC]] titled ''The Importance of Being Famous'' (2003), about fame and the manner in which celebrities are covered by modern media. At the annual [[Pride of Britain Awards]] broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], Morgan chaired a panel of prominent people who had chosen the recipients of the awards from 1999 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prideofbritain.com/contentPages/judges/default.aspx |title=Judges |author=The Pride of Britain Awards |publisher=Trinity Mirror Group |accessdate=26 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217203455/http://www.prideofbritain.com/contentPages/judges/default.aspx |archivedate=17 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He co-hosted a current affairs interview show on [[Channel 4]] with [[Amanda Platell]], ''Morgan and Platell''. Morgan and Platell were put together because of their opposing political viewpoints; Platell interrogated guests from the [[right wing]], Morgan from the [[left wing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.newstatesman.com/200411080018 | title= Amanda Platell notes Piers Morgan's two left feet|newspaper=New Statesman |date=8 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was dropped after three series reputedly because of poor viewing figures, although the chairman of Channel 4 [[Luke Johnson (Businessman)|Luke Johnson]] was reported not to like the programme.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/may/12/channel4.politicsandthemedia "Morgan and Platell to return on Channel 4"], ''MediaGuardian'', 12 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2006, Morgan appeared as a judge on the television show ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' alongside [[Brandy Norwood]] and [[David Hasselhoff]] on [[NBC]]. Morgan was chosen by Simon Cowell as a replacement for himself because of the conditions of his ''[[American Idol]]'' contract. Morgan appeared as a celebrity contestant on ''[[Comic Relief Does The Apprentice]]'' in 2007, to raise money for the BBC charity telethon [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. After his team lost, Morgan was selected by [[Alan Sugar|Sir Alan Sugar]] as the contestant to be fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tvnews.virginmedia.com/news/?news_id=7543|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618102236/http://tvnews.virginmedia.com/news/?news_id=7543|archivedate=18 June 2008|title='Red Nose apprentice' Morgan fired|author=PA Entertainment|date= 16 March 2007|work=TV News|publisher=Virgin Media|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, Morgan appeared as a judge for the second season of ''America's Got Talent'' and also appeared as a judge on ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], alongside [[Amanda Holden]] and Simon Cowell. He also presented ''You Can't Fire Me, I'm Famous'' on [[BBC One]]. He fronted a three-part documentary about [[Sandbanks]] for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] entitled ''Piers Morgan on Sandbanks'' in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Sandbanks/default.html|title=Sandbanks: Piers Morgan meets Dorset's mega-rich|date=10 January 2008|publisher=ITV|accessdate=8 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621170129/http://www.itv.com/Sandbanks/default.html|archivedate=21 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan signed a two-year "[[golden handcuffs]]" deal with ITV in May 2008, reportedly worth £2 million per year. As part of the deal, he would continue as a judge on ''Britain's Got Talent'' for at least two more series and front a new [[Talk/Chat show|chat show]]. He also made some interview specials, plus three more documentaries from various countries. Morgan's golden handcuffs deal was the first signing by ITV's new director of television, [[Peter Fincham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/may/29/itv.television|title=Piers Morgan: Britain's Got Talent judge signs two-year deal with ITV|last=Conlan|first=Tara|date= 29 May 2008|newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September 2008, Morgan featured in ''[[The Dark Side of Fame with Piers Morgan]]'', produced by [[BBC Scotland]].

He returned to ITV in February 2009, with the three-part series, ''[[Piers Morgan On...]]'', which saw him visit [[Dubai]], [[Monte Carlo]] and [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Preston|first=John|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4371911/Review-Piers-Morgan-in...-Dubai-ITV1-and-Jamie-Saves-Our-Bacon-Channel-4.html|title=Review: Piers Morgan in...

From 13 April to 17 April 2015, Morgan guest-hosted five episodes of ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and became a permanent co-host in November 2015, appearing alongside [[Susanna Reid]] and [[Charlotte Hawkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Guardian|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=14 October 2015|title=Piers Morgan handed permanent role on Good Morning Britain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/13/piers-morgan-permanent-fixture-good-morning-britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; "You can't help but go into battle with him every morning", Reid has said of her colleague with whom she has clashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44524374|title=Susanna Reid in 'constant battle' with Piers Morgan|work=BBC News|date=19 June 2018|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donald Trump===
Morgan was the winner of the U.S. celebrity version of ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 7)|The Apprentice]]'', in 2008.

Morgan predicted Trump's election as [[President of the United States]] and has described himself as a close personal friend of Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=Piers|title=It’s weird when your friend becomes leader of the free world|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/12/its-weird-when-your-friend-becomes-leader-of-the-free-world/|work=The Spectator|date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan interviewed Donald Trump on ''Good Morning Britain'' in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Demianyk|first=Graeme|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-piers-morgan-good-morning-britain_uk_56f230f1e4b08af01be9c210|title=Donald Trump Tells Piers Morgan That Muslims Are ‘Absolutely Not’ Reporting Terrorists|work=The Huffington Post|date=23 March 2016|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan appeared on ITV's ''[[Loose Women]]'' panel show in late January 2017, and was challenged to repudiate Donald Trump.&lt;ref name=LooseWomen/&gt; He refused to do so, despite stating that he disagreed with him on many issues relating to gun control, climate change, abortion and the [[Executive Order 13769|'Muslim travel ban']], saying that he found the principle of the ban understandable, but disagreed with "the way [Trump] has gone about it".&lt;ref name=LooseWomen&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/30/piers-morgan-defends-friendship-with-donald-trump|title=Piers Morgan defends friendship with Donald Trump|work=The Guardian|date=31 January 2017|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a fortnight later, on the American talk show ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', Morgan said "There is no Muslim ban", as "85% of the world's Muslims are allowed in the country". Another participant in the discussion, Australian comedian [[Jim Jefferies (comedian)|Jim Jefferies]], immediately told him to "fuck off", adding in part "[[Hitler]] didn't kill the Jews on the first day, he worked up to it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stolworthy|first=Jacob|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/jim-jefferies-piers-morgan-defence-of-donald-trump-muslim-ban-real-time-with-bill-maher-a7574746.html|title=Piers Morgan slammed by Jim Jefferies after defending Donald Trump on talk show ''Real Time with Bill Maher''|work=The Independent|date=11 February 2017|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the novelist [[J.

Morgan criticised Trump after Trump retweeted [[Jayda Fransen]], deputy leader of the small right-wing party [[Britain First]] in late November 2017. He tweeted to Trump: "What the hell are you doing retweeting a bunch of unverified videos by Britain First, a bunch of disgustingly racist far-right extremists?

==Feuds==

===Ian Hislop===
Morgan appeared as a guest on the satirical news quiz ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' in an episode transmitted on 24 May 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/have-i-got-news-for-you/felix-dexter-piers-morgan-clive-anderson/episode/143355/summary.html Have I Got News for You Episode Guide &gt; Season 11, Episode 6] TV.com&lt;/ref&gt; In it, show regular [[Ian Hislop]] accused Morgan of having him followed and having his house watched. The conflict escalated and at one point the host, [[Angus Deayton]], asked if they wished to go outside and have a fight. Later on, guest panellist [[Clive Anderson]] confronted Morgan commenting, "the last time I was rude to you, you sent photographers to my doorstep the next day", to which Piers Morgan retorted, "You won't see them this time." The audience responded loudly in favour of Hislop.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' BBC2, Series 11 episode 6; Transmitted on 24 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; "We're about to start exposing the moon-faced midget", Morgan was quoted as saying in 2002, to which Hislop responded, "all he's been offering for information about my private life is a £50 reward. My friends think that's not nearly enough."&lt;ref name="Summerskill" /&gt;

In 2007, Hislop chose Morgan as one of his pet hates on ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]''.&lt;ref name=R101&gt;''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]'' BBC2, Series 11 episode 6; Transmitted on 9 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/room_101/episodes/11/6/ Room 101 Episode 11.6 – Ian Hislop] British Comedy Guide&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Hislop spoke of the history of animosity between himself and Morgan and revealed that after their exchange on ''Have I Got News For You'' (which was shown as a clip), Morgan's reporters were tasked with trying to get gossip on Hislop's private life (including phoning acquaintances of Hislop), and photographers were sent in case Hislop did anything untoward or embarrassing while in their presence. Neither the reporters nor the photographers succeeded. Hislop also revealed that Morgan had attempted to quell the feud in an article in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'', saying, "The war is over. I'm officially calling an end to hostilities, at least from my end. I'm sure it won't stop him carrying on his 'Piers Moron' stuff"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Emily |date=4 April 2011 |title=Piers Morgan: The Biography |url=http://www.johnblakepublishing.co.uk/e-store/Piers-Morgan-The-Biography.html |location=London |publisher=[[John Blake (journalist)#John Blake Publishing|John Blake Publishing Ltd]] |page= |isbn=1843583518 |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Private Eye]]'', the fortnightly satirical magazine which Hislop edits, regularly calls Morgan 'Piers Moron')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=What a moron |newspaper=[[Private Eye]] |date=20 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hattenstone |first=Simon |date=12 October 2013 |title=Piers Morgan: 'I want to be at the centre of the big stuff' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/12/piers-morgan-shooting-straight |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ellison |first=Sarah |author-link=Sarah Ellison |date=November 2012 |title=Blood, Sweat, and Piers |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2012/11/piers-morgan-criticized-hated-than-ignored |newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hislop, who was working on a [[World War I]] documentary at the time, responded by asking "Is that an armistice or an unconditional surrender?" Although [[Paul Merton]] – host of ''Room 101'' at the time and regular team captain alongside Hislop at ''Have I Got News For You'' – agreed to put Morgan into ''Room 101'', he then comically rejected Morgan as being "too toxic" for ''Room 101''.&lt;ref name=R101/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/10/broadcasting.tvandradio1 "Room 101, BBC1"], The Guardian, 10 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anthony |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Anthony |date=20 April 2010 |title=Piers Morgan: The man with stars in his eyes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/jun/20/profile-piers-morgan |newspaper=The Observer |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
In October 2003, journalist and television personality [[Jeremy Clarkson]] reportedly emptied a glass of [[water]] over Morgan during the last flight of [[Concorde]] for some photographs published in the ''Mirror''.&lt;ref name="Media Monkey"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/mar/17/mediamonkey.pressandpublishing|author=Media Monkey|title=Clarkson and Morgan in tabloid tussle|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 March 2004|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2004, at the [[British Press Awards]], Clarkson punched Morgan three times during another argument.&lt;ref name="Media Monkey"/&gt; Morgan reported on a rapprochement with Clarkson in the epilogue of his book, ''Don't You Know Who I Am?''

On 4 February 2014, transgender advocate [[Janet Mock]] appeared as a guest on ''Piers Morgan Live'' to discuss her memoir, ''Redefining Realness''. After the interview aired, Mock sent a series of tweets criticising Morgan for describing Mock as being "formerly a man". Morgan responded that he had "never been treated in such a disgraceful manner" by a guest. On 5 February, Mock appeared as a guest again to debate the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hedgecock |first=Sarah |url=http://gawker.com/piers-morgan-demands-apology-from-disgraceful-trans-w-1516913568 |title=Piers Morgan Demands Apology from "Disgraceful" Trans Woman Guest |accessdate=6 February 2014 |newspaper=Gawker |date=5 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206203218/http://gawker.com/piers-morgan-demands-apology-from-disgraceful-trans-w-1516913568 |archivedate= 6 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan strongly objected to the [[2017 Women's March|Women's March on Washington]] on 21 January 2017, the day after [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|Trump's inauguration]], describing protesters as "rabid feminists" and the multiple protests as being "vacuous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oppenheim|first1=Maya|title=Piers Morgan just accused Ewan McGregor of being 'paedophile-loving hypocrite'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/piers-morgan-ewan-mcgregor-accuse-paedophile-loving-hypocrite-good-morning-britain-no-show-t2-a7543911.html|accessdate=27 February 2017|work=The Independent|date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor [[Ewan McGregor]] disagreed with Morgan's statements on the women's march and pulled out of appearing on ''Good Morning Britain'' the following Tuesday after discovered Morgan would be interviewing him, along with Reid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38729770|title=Ewan McGregor and Piers Morgan row over Good Morning Britain appearance|publisher=BBC News|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan accused McGregor of being a "paedophile-loving hypocrite" for his past support of [[Roman Polanski]].&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aitkenhead|first=Decca|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/28/piers-morgan-im-just-putting-opinions-out-there-its-my-job|title=Piers Morgan: 'I’m just putting opinions out there.

===Banned guests===
On 28 March 2012, MTV referred to the bad relations between Piers Morgan and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], reporting that "Morgan has apparently felt slighted over the years by Madonna ... he claims he was lied to by the singer's publicist".&lt;ref name="Kaufman"&gt;"Madonna Banned..." by Gil Kaufman, ''MTV.com'', 28 March 2012; [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1681945/madonna-banned-piers-morgan.jhtml retrieved 30 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, it was reported that Morgan had also banned actor [[Kelsey Grammer]]. Morgan himself claimed, "Kelsey Grammer saw a photo of [[Camille Grammer|his ex-wife Camille]] in the open of our show and legged it."&lt;ref&gt;"Kelsey Grammer Walks Out on Piers Morgan", ''ABCNews'', 20 September 2012; [http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/09/kelsey-grammer-walks-out-on-piers-morgan retrieved 30 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TVGuide]]'' reported, "All plans were still a go for the segment until Grammer actually got in the hot seat and saw the footage the producers had planned to peg to the segment, including a picture of his ex-wife".&lt;ref&gt;"Kelsey Grammer storms off set" by Emily Gagne, ''TVGuide.ca'', 20 September 2012; [http://tvguide.ca/TVNews/Articles/120920_grammer_leaves_piers_EG.htm retrieved 30 September 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;  On 26 September 2012, Fox 11 Los Angeles reported that "many say [it] was an ambush by Piers".&lt;ref&gt;Official Facebook page: ''FOX 11 Flash'', 26 September 2012; [https://www.facebook.com/FOX11Flash retrieved  30 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' reported that "before the interview was scheduled, it was made clear that Grammer would answer all questions, including those about [his ex-wife].

Morgan also banned actor [[Hugh Grant]] from his shows on CNN and ITV in May 2011 after Grant denigrated the tabloid press. On Twitter he responded: "Hugh Grant is now banned, in perpetuity, from @PiersTonight and Life Stories and anything else I ever do. Tedious little man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/piers-morgan-bans-tedious-little-man-hugh-grant-from-cnn-show/|title=Piers Morgan bans 'tedious little man' Hugh Grant from CNN show|work=Press Gazette|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phone hacking allegations==
During Morgan's tenure as editor, the ''Daily Mirror'' was advised by Steven Nott that voicemail interception was possible by means of a standard PIN code. Despite staff initially expressing enthusiasm for the story it did not appear in the paper, although it did subsequently feature in a ''[[South Wales Argus]]'' article and on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] in October 1999. On 18 July 2011 Nott was visited by officers of [[Operation Weeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/this-scandal-is-all-my-fault-says-salesman-2332669.html|first=Matt|last=Blake|title=This scandal is all my fault, says salesman|newspaper=The Independent|date=6 August 2011|accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He came under criticism for his "boasting" about phone hacking from [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Louise Mensch]], who has since apologised for these accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14346050 |publisher=BBC News |title=MP Mensch apologises to Piers Morgan for hacking slur |date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, in a sequence of articles, political blogger [[Paul Staines]] alleged that while editor of the ''Daily Mirror'' in 2002 Morgan published a story concerning the affair of [[Sven-Goran Eriksson]] and [[Ulrika Jonsson]] while knowing it to have been obtained by [[phone hacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Young |first=Toby |author-link=Toby Young |date=29 July 2011 |title=The net closes around Piers Morgan |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100098912/the-net-closes-around-piers-morgan/ |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2011, Morgan was a witness by satellite link from the United States at the [[Leveson Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="BBCLeverson"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16259941 "Piers Morgan tells Leveson: Daily Mirror did not hack phones"], BBC News, 20 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; While he said he had no reason to believe that phone hacking had occurred at the ''Mirror'' while he was in charge there, he admitted to hearing a recording of an answerphone message left by [[Paul McCartney]] for [[Heather Mills]], but refused to "discuss where that tape was played or who made [it] – it would compromise a source."&lt;ref name="BBCLeverson"/&gt; Appearing as a witness at the same Inquiry on 9 February 2012, Mills was asked under oath if she had ever made a recording of Paul McCartney's phone call or had played it to Piers Morgan; she replied: "Never".&lt;ref name="anon"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/9071901/Leveson-Inquiry-Heather-Mills-vows-she-did-not-play-Paul-McCartney-messages-to-Piers-Morgan.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|title=Leveson Inquiry: Heather Mills vows she did not play Paul McCartney messages to Piers Morgan|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael Holden"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Holden|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-britain-hacking-morgan-idUSTRE8181CL20120209|publisher=[[Reuters]]|title=Beatle's ex-wife says Piers Morgan heard hacked call|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She said that she had never authorised Morgan, or anybody, to access or listen to her voicemails.&lt;ref name="anon"/&gt;  Mills told the inquiry that Morgan, "a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years", would have relished telling the inquiry if she had played a personal voicemail message to him.&lt;ref name="Michael Holden"/&gt;

On 23 May 2012, ''[[Newsnight]]'' presenter [[Jeremy Paxman]] was a witness at the Leveson Inquiry. He recalled a lunch with the ''Mirror'' editor in September 2002 at which Morgan outlined the means of hacking into a mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Sabbagh and Lisa O'Carroll [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/23/leveson-piers-morgan-paxman "Piers Morgan told me how to hack a phone, says Jeremy Paxman"], ''The Guardian'', 23 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2012, the [[Channel 4]] documentary ''Taking on the Tabloids'', fronted by actor and phone hacking victim [[Hugh Grant]], showed footage from a 2003 interview with Morgan by the singer and phone hacking victim [[Charlotte Church]], during which he explained to her how to avoid answerphone messages being listened to by journalists. He said: "You can access ... voicemails by typing in a number. Now, are you really telling me that journalists aren’t going to do that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matilda Battersby|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/video-from-2003-shows-piers-morgan-talking-about-phone-hacking-8364468.html|title=Video from 2003 shows Piers Morgan talking about phone hacking|newspaper=The Independent|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tntmagazine.com/news/uk/video-new-clip-surfaces-showing-piers-morgan-talking-to-charlotte-church-about-phone-hacking|title=Video: New clip surfaces showing Piers Morgan talking to Charlotte Church about phone hacking|newspaper=[[TNT (magazine)|TNT]]|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 2012, the official findings of the [[Leveson Inquiry]] were released, in which [[Lord Justice Leveson]] said that Morgan's testimony under oath on phone hacking was "utterly unpersuasive". He stated:  "[The] evidence does not establish that [Morgan] authorised the hacking of voicemails or that journalists employed by TMG [Trinity Mirror Group] were indulging in this practice ... What it does, however, clearly prove is that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it."&lt;ref name="Mark Sweney"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.itv.com/news/2012-11-28/key-moments-from-the-leveson-inquiry |title=Key moments from the Leveson Inquiry |publisher=ITV News |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|Piers Morgan interviewed by police investigating phone hacking}}
On 6 December 2013, Morgan was interviewed, under caution, by police officers from Operation Weeting investigating phone hacking allegations at ''[[Mirror Group Newspapers]]'' during his tenure as editor.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Evans [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/10638562/Piers-Morgan-questioned-by-police-over-phone-hacking.html "Piers Morgan questioned by police over phone-hacking"], telegraph,.co.uk, 14 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2014, the [[Trinity Mirror|Trinity Mirror publishing group]] admitted for the first time that some of its journalists had been involved in phone hacking and agreed to pay compensation to four people who sued for the alleged hacking of voicemails.&lt;ref&gt;Gallivan, Rory and Zekaria, Simon (September 2014) [https://online.wsj.com/articles/trinity-mirror-admits-liability-over-phone-hacking-1411547673 “Trinity Mirror Admits Liability Over Phone Hacking”], ''Wall Street Journal'', 24 September 2014.

Retrieved 29 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Six other phone-hacking claims had already been settled. The BBC reported that it had seen legal papers showing that although the alleged hacking could have taken place as early as 1998, the bulk of the alleged wrongdoing took place in the early 2000s when Morgan was the ''Daily Mirror'' editor.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;BBC News online  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29339756 “Phone-hacking: Trinity Mirror admits liability”], BBC News online, 24 September 2014 (Retrieved 29 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  The admissions by Trinity Mirror came whilst the London Metropolitan Police investigation into the phone hacking allegations was ongoing. Morgan has always denied any involvement in the practice.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

[[File:Radio operator - Royal Thai Police Na Wa.jpg|thumb|A radio operator of the [[Royal Thai Police]].]]
[[File:BOS-Funkantenne.jpg|thumb|Antenna of the [[Bavarian State Police]], Germany.]]
'''Police radio''' is a communications radio system used by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agencies all over the world.

Many such systems are encrypted to prevent eavesdroppers from listening in.

==Portable radios==
The vast majority of economically developed countries police services have access to such equipment; also, in most countries, [[police car]]s have sets which are designed to receive calls from the control room, and respond. Also, small personal radios exist that allow each officer to carry one easily, as well as a large central room at the [[Police station]] which directs personnel to the location of emergency incidents. Portable police radios first appeared within the [[British police]] in 1969.

==By country==

===Germany===

In Germany, it is illegal for private citizens to listen to the police radio, even if its unintentional. One can be sued with up to two years of prison or substantially fined.

===Norway===

In Norway, it is legal for private citizens to listen to the police radio, there are even streams available online.

===United Kingdom===
It is an offence under the [[Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006]] to listen to police radio in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/36/section/48
|accessdate=2014-08-17
|title=Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006
|date=2014-08-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/enforcement/spectrum-enforcement/guidance
|accessdate=2014-08-17
|title=Ofcom - Guidance on Receive-Only Radio Scanners
|date=2014-08-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move from open [[Analog signal|analogue]] to the encrypted [[Digital data|digital]] [[Airwave (communications network)|Airwave]] system in the UK has made it practically impossible to just listen in to police radio.

===United States===
U.S state patrols, county [[Sheriff|sheriffs' offices]], and municipal police departments often run their own systems in parallel, presenting [[interoperability]] problems. The FCC assigns licenses to these entities in the public safety (PP and PX) allotments of the spectrum. These include allocations in the lower portion of the [[VHF]] spectrum (around 39 - 45&amp;nbsp;MHz), highly susceptible to [[Sporadic E|"skip"]] interference but still used by state highway patrols; the VHF "hi-band", from 150 to 160&amp;nbsp;MHz; and various UHF bands. Many systems still use conventional [[Frequency modulation|FM]] transmissions for most traffic; others are [[Trunking|trunked]] analog or digital systems. Recently, there has been a move towards digital trunked systems, especially those based around the public-safety standard [[Project 25]] format set by the [[Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International]]. A minority of other police radio systems, the largest examples being the [[Milwaukee]] Police Department and [[Pennsylvania State Police]] use the incompatible [[OpenSky]] format. [[TETRA]], the standard in many European countries as well as other places in the world, is virtually unused in the United States.

Recently, some states have begun to operate statewide radio networks with varying levels of participation from police on the county and city levels. Some of them are:

* Illinois: [[StarCom21]]
* Louisiana: LWIN Louisiana Wireless Information Network
* Michigan: MPSCS Michigan Public Safety Communications System
* Minnesota: [[ARMER]] [http://www.srb.state.mn.us]
* Montana: Montana Statewide Interoperable Public Safety Radio System [http://pssb.mt.gov/siec/default.mcpx]
* North Carolina: VIPER [http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/Index2.cfm?a=000001,001148]
* Ohio: MARCS - Multi-agency communications system
* South Carolina: Palmetto 800
* Wisconsin: WISCOM [http://interop.wi.gov/section.asp?linkid=1621&amp;locid=166]

It is generally legal in the United States to listen to unencrypted police communications. However some states prohibit such listening within vehicles.

A '''real estate contract''' is a [[contract]] between parties for the purchase and sale, exchange, or other [[Conveyancing|conveyance]] of [[real estate]]. The sale of land is governed by the laws and practices of the jurisdiction in which the land is located. Real estate called [[leasehold estate]] is actually a [[rental]] of real property such as an apartment, and [[leases]] (rental contracts) cover such rentals since they typically do not result in recordable [[deed]]s.  [[Freehold (real property)|Freehold]] ("More permanent") conveyances of real estate are covered by real estate contracts, including conveying [[fee simple]] [[Title (property)|title]], [[life estate]]s, remainder estates, and freehold [[easement]]s.  Real estate contracts are typically [[bilateral contract]]s (i. e., agreed to by two parties) and should have the legal requirements specified by [[contract law]] in general and should also be '''in writing''' to be enforceable.

==Details explained on the contract==

===In writing===
It is a legal requirement in all jurisdictions that contracts for the sale of land be in writing to be enforceable. The various ''[[Statute of frauds]]'' require contracts for the sale of land to be in writing. In [[South Africa]], the ''Alienation of Land Act'' specifies that any agreement of sale of immovable property must be in writing. In [[Italy]], each transfer of real estate must be registered in front of a [[notary public]] in writing.

The common practice is for an "exchange of contracts" to take place. This involves two copies of the contract of sale being signed, one copy of which is retained by each party. When the parties are together, both would usually sign both copies, one copy of which would be retained by each party, sometimes with a formal handing over of a copy from one party to the other. However, it is usually sufficient that only the copy retained by each party be signed by the other party only. This rule enables contracts to be "exchanged" by mail. Both copies of the contract of sale become binding only after each party is in possession of a copy of the contract signed by the other party—ie., the exchange is said to be "complete". An exchange by electronic means is generally insufficient for an exchange, unless the laws of the jurisdiction expressly validate such signatures.

A contract for the sale of land must:

* '''Identify the parties:''' The full name of the parties must be on the contract. In a sales contract, the parties are the seller(s) and buyer(s) of the real estate, who are often called the [[:wikt:principal|principals]] to distinguish them from [[real estate agent]]s, who are effectively their intermediaries and representatives in [[negotiation]] of the price. If there are any real estate agents brokering the sale, they are typically listed also as the real estate brokers/agents who would earn the commission from the sale.
* '''Identify the real estate (property):''' At least the [[Address (geography)|address]], but preferably the legal description must be on the contract.
* '''Identify the purchase price:''' The amount of the sales price or a reasonably ascertainable figure (an appraisal to be completed at a future date) must be on the contract.
* '''Include signatures:''' A real estate contract must be entered into voluntarily (not by force), and must be signed by the parties.
* '''Have a legal purpose:''' The contract is void if it calls for illegal action.
* '''Involve [[Competence (law)|Competent]] parties:''' Mentally impaired, drugged persons, etc. cannot enter into a contract.  Contracts in which at least one of the parties is a minor are voidable by the minor.
* '''Reflect a meeting of the minds:''' Each side must be clear and agree as to the essential details, rights, and obligations of the contract.
* '''Include [[Consideration]]:'''  Consideration is something of value bargained for in exchange of the real estate.  Money is the most common form of consideration, but other consideration of value, such as other property in exchange, or a promise to perform (i.e. a promise to pay) is also satisfactory.

Notarization by a notary public is normally not required for a real estate contract, but many recording offices require that a seller's or conveyor's signature on a [[deed]] be notarized to record the deed. The real estate contract is typically not recorded with the government, although statements or declarations of the price paid are commonly required to be submitted to the recorder's office.

Sometimes real estate contracts will provide for a [[lawyer]] review period of several days after the signing by the parties to check the provisions of the contract and counterpropose any that are unsuitable.

If there are any real estate brokers/agents brokering the sale, the buyer's agent will often fill in the blanks on a standard contract form for the buyer(s) and seller(s) to sign.  The broker commonly gets such contract forms from a real estate association he/she belongs to.  When both buyer and seller have agreed to the contract by signing it, the broker provides copies of the signed contract to the buyer and seller.

===Offer and acceptance===
As may be the case with other contracts, real estate contracts may be formed by one party making an [[Offer and acceptance|offer]] and another party [[Offer and acceptance|accepting]] the offer.  To be enforceable, the offers and acceptances must be in writing ([[Statute of frauds|Statute of Frauds]], [[Common Law]])and signed by the parties agreeing to the contract.  Often, the party making the offer prepares a written real estate contract, signs it, and transmits it to the other party who would accept the offer by signing the contract.  As with all other types of legal offers, the other party may accept the offer, reject it (in which case the offer is terminated), make a counteroffer (in which case the original offer is terminated), or not respond to the offer (in which case the offer terminates by the [[expiration (options)|expiration date]] in it).  Before the offer (or counteroffer) is accepted, the offering (or countering) party can withdraw it.  A counteroffer may be countered with yet another offer, and a counteroffering process may go on indefinitely between the parties.

To be enforceable, a real estate contract must possess original signatures by the parties and any alterations to the contract must be initialed by all the parties involved. If the original offer is marked up and initialed by the party receiving it, then signed, this is not an offer and acceptance but a counter-offer.

===Deed specified===
A real estate contract typically does not [[conveyancing|convey]] or transfer [[ownership]] of real estate by itself. A different document called a [[deed]] is used to convey real estate.  In a real estate contract, the type of deed to be used to convey the real estate may be specified, such as a [[warranty deed]] or a [[quitclaim deed]]. If a deed type is not specifically mentioned, "marketable title" may be specified, implying a warranty deed should be provided. Lenders will insist on a warranty deed.  Any [[lien]]s or other [[encumbrance]]s on the [[Title (property)|title]] to the real estate should be mentioned up front in the real estate contract, so the presence of these deficiencies would not be a reason for [[voidable|voiding]] the contract at or before the [[Closing (real estate)|closing]]. If the liens are not cleared before by the time of the closing, then the deed should specifically have an exception(s) listed for the lien(s) not cleared.

The buyer(s) signing the real estate contract are liable (legally responsible) for providing the promised consideration for the real estate, which is typically money in the amount of the purchase price. However, the details about the type of ownership may not be specified in the contract.  Sometimes, signing buyer(s) may direct a lawyer preparing the deed separately what type of ownership to list on the deed and may decide to add a joint owner(s), such as a spouse, to the deed.  For example, [[Concurrent estate|types of joint ownership]] (title) may include tenancy in common, joint tenancy with right of survivorship, or joint tenancy by the entireties.  Another possibility is ownership in [[Trust (law)|trust]] instead of direct ownership.

===Contingencies===
[[Contingency (contract)|Contingencies]] are conditions which must be met if a contract is to be performed.

Contingencies that suspend the contract until certain events occur are known as "suspensive conditions". Contingencies that cancel the contract if certain event occur are known as "resolutive conditions".

Most contracts of sale contain contingencies of some kind or another, because few people can afford to enter into a real estate purchase without them. But it is possible for a real estate contract not to have any contingencies.

Some types of contingencies which can appear in a real estate contract include:

*[[Mortgage loan|Mortgage]] contingency&amp;nbsp;– Performance of the contract (purchase of the real estate) is ''contingent upon'' or ''subject to'' the buyer getting a mortgage [[loan]] for the purchase.   Usually such a contingency calls for a buyer to apply for a loan within a certain period of time after the contract is signed.  Since most people who buy a house require financing to complete their purchase, mortgage contingencies are one of the most common type of contingencies in [[real property]] contracts.  If the financing is not secured, the buyer may unilaterally cancel the contract by stating that his or her condition has not or will not be satisfied or allow the contract to expire by declining to waive the condition within the specified time period.
*Inspection contingency&amp;nbsp;– Another buyer's condition.  Purchase of the real estate is contingent upon a satisfactory inspection of the real property revealing no significant defects.  Contingencies could also be made on the satisfactory repair of a certain item associated with the real estate.
*another sale contingency&amp;nbsp;– Purchase or sale of the real estate is contingent on a successful sale or purchase of another piece of real estate.  The successful sale of another house may be needed to finance the purchase of a new one.
*appraisal contingency&amp;nbsp;– Purchase of the real estate is contingent upon the contract price being at or below a [[fair market value]] determined by an [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]].  Lenders will often not lend more than a certain percentage (fraction) of the appraised value, so such a contingency may be useful for a buyer.
*[[72-hour clause|72-hour kick out contingency]] - Seller contingency, in which the seller accepts a contract from a buyer with a contingency (typically a home sale or rent contingency where the buyer conditions the sale on their ability to find a buyer or renter for their current property prior to settlement).  The seller retains the right to sell the property to another party if he so chooses after giving the buyer 72 hours notice to remove their contingency.  The buyer will then either remove their contingency and provide proof that they can consummate the sale or will release the seller from their contract and allow the seller to move forward with the new contract.

===Date of closing and possession===
A typical real estate contract specifies a date by which the closing must occur. The closing is the event in which the money (or other consideration) for the real estate is paid for and [[Title (property)|title]] (ownership) of the real estate is conveyed from the seller(s) to the buyer(s). The conveyance is done by the seller(s) signing a deed for buyer(s) or their attorneys or other agents to record the transfer of ownership.  Often other paperwork is necessary at the closing.

The date of the closing is normally also the date when [[Possession (law)|possession]] of the real estate is transferred from the seller(s) to the buyer(s). However, the real estate contract can specify a different date when possession changes hands. Transfer of possession of a house, condominium, or building is usually accomplished by handing over the key(s) to it.  The contract may have provisions in case the seller(s) hold over possession beyond the agreed date.

The contract can also specify which party pays for what closing cost(s). If the contract does not specify, then there are certain customary defaults depending on law, common law (judicial precedents), location, and other orders or agreements, regarding who pays for which closing costs.

===Condition of property===
A real estate contract may specify in what condition of the property should be when conveying the title or transferring possession.  For example, the contract may say that the property is sold as is, especially if demolition is intended.  Alternatively there may be a representation or a warranty (guarantee) regarding the condition of the house, building, or some part of it such as affixed appliances, [[HVAC]] system, etc.  Sometimes a separate disclosure form specified by a government entity is also used.  The contract could also specify any [[personal property]] (non-real property) items which are to be included with the deal, such as washer and dryer which are normally detachable from the house.  Utility meters, [[electrical wiring]] systems, [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or [[circuit breaker]] boxes, [[plumbing]], [[furnace]]s, [[water heater]]s, [[sink]]s, [[toilet]]s, [[bathtub]]s, and most [[central air conditioning]] systems are normally considered to be attached to a house or building and would normally be included with the real property by default.

===Riders===
Riders (or addenda) are special attachments (separate sheets) that become part of the contract in certain situations.

===Earnest money deposit===
Although money is the most common consideration, it is not a required element to have a valid real estate contract. 
An [[earnest money]]  deposit from the buyer(s) customarily accompanies an offer to buy real estate and the deposit is held by a third party, like a title company, attorney or sometimes the seller.  The amount, a small fraction of the total price, is listed in the contract, with the remainder of the cost to be paid at the closing. In some rare cases, other instruments of value, like notes and/or stock or other negotiable instruments can be used for consideration. Other hard assets, like gold, silver and anything of value can also be used or in other cases, love (where it can be shown to have existed between the parties).  However, the earnest money deposit represents a credit towards the final sales price, which is usually the main or only consideration.

==Financial qualifications of buyer(s)==
The better the financial qualification of the buyer(s) is, the more likely the closing will be successfully completed, which is typically the goal of the seller.  Any documentation demonstrating financial qualifications of the buyer(s), such as mortgage loan pre-approval or pre-qualification, may accompany a real estate offer to buy along with an earnest money check.  When there are competing offers or when a lower offer is presented, the seller may be more likely to accept an offer from a buyer demonstrating evidence of being well qualified than from a buyer without such evidence.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5702">{{Hegelianism}}
The '''Right Hegelians''' ({{lang-de|Rechtshegelianer}}), '''Old Hegelians''' (''Althegelianer''), or '''the Hegelian Right''' (''die Hegelsche Rechte''), were those followers of [[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in the early 19th century who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously [[conservative]] direction.  They are typically contrasted with the [[Young Hegelians]], who interpreted Hegel's [[political philosophy]] to support innovations in politics or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2026775|journal= The Journal of Philosophy|date=1987 |title= The Discourse of Modernity: Hegel and Habermas|last=Dallmayr|first=Fred|volume=84|pages=682–692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Hegel's [[historicism]] holds that both ideas and institutions can only be understood by understanding their history.  Throughout his life, Hegel said he was an [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Lutheran]]. He devoted considerable attention to [[the Absolute]], his term for the infinite Spirit responsible for the totality of reality—something like God, though not the God of classical theism. This Spirit comes to fullest expression in the historical reality of the modern state. In his ''Philosophy of Right'', Hegel writes that:

{{quotation|The [[Sovereign state|State]] is absolutely rational inasmuch as it is the actuality of the substantial will which it possesses in the particular self-consciousness once that consciousness has been raised to consciousness of its universality. This substantial unity is an absolute unmoved end in itself, in which freedom comes into its supreme right. On the other hand this final end has supreme right against the individual, whose supreme duty is to be a member of the State.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hegel, Georg H. W. 1821. Philosophy of Right. Trad. S. W. Dyde, 2008. Cosimo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aNa9-h-RGTMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=snippet&amp;q=state%20end%20individual&amp;f=false Google Print, p. 133]&lt;/ref&gt;|''Philosophy of Right'', "The State", p. 258}}

The Hegelian right expanded this conception of [[statism]], seizing on it as an affirmation of establishment politics and orthodox religion.  Hegel's historicism could be read to affirm the historical inevitability of modern institutions; a [[nation]] was an [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideal]], existing in Hegelian [[idealism]] above and about the people who constituted it.  To argue for political change was to attack the Ideal of the national state.  The Right Hegelians believed that advanced [[Europe]]an societies, as they existed in the first half of the nineteenth century, were the summit of all social development, the product of the historical [[dialectic]] that had existed thus far.  Most praised the Prussian state, which enjoyed an extensive [[civil service]] system, good universities, [[industrialization]], and high [[employment]], as the acme of progress and the incarnation of the ''[[Zeitgeist]]''.

Many of the members of the Hegelian right went on to have distinguished careers in public academia or the Lutheran Church.  As a school, they were closely associated with the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], and held many of the chairs of philosophy and theology there.  Generally, the philosophers of the Hegelian right have been neglected; their fame, if not their reputations, has been eclipsed by the [[Young Hegelians]], including [[Bruno Bauer]] and [[Karl Marx]]. They left their mark chiefly in theology.  Their efforts did not have the intended effect of bolstering a sense of the inevitability of faith as a product of history; rather, they pioneered the introduction of [[higher criticism]] by demonstrating the influence of an era on the development of Christianity.

Philosophers within the camp of the Hegelian right include:

* [[Johann Philipp Gabler]]
* [[Hermann Friedrich Wilhelm Hinrichs]]
* [[Karl Daub]]
* [[Heinrich Leo]]
* [[Leopold von Henning]]
* [[Heinrich Gustav Hotho]]

Other thinkers or historians who may be included among the Hegelian right, with some reservations, include:

* [[Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz]]
* [[Eduard Gans]]
* [[Karl Ludwig Michelet]]
* [[Philip Marheineke]]
* [[Wilhelm Vatke]]
* [[Johann Eduard Erdmann]]
* [[Eduard Zeller]]
* [[Albert Schwegler]]
* [[Hans Lassen Martensen]]

==Speculative theism&lt;!--'Speculative theism' and 'Speculative theist' redirect here--&gt;==
'''Speculative theism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; was a 1830s movement closely related to but distinguished from Right Hegelianism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]] (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Hegel'', Cambridge University Press, 1993, p. 339 n. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents ([[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]], [[Christian Hermann Weisse]], [[Hermann Ulrici]])&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Parker, Krzysztof Skowronski (eds.), ''Josiah Royce for the Twenty-first Century: Historical, Ethical, and Religious Interpretations'', Lexington Books, 2012, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; were united in their demand to recover the "[[personal God]]" after [[panlogist]] Hegelianism.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Breckman, ''Marx, the Young Hegelians, and the Origins of Radical Social Theory: Dethroning the Self'', Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement featured elements of [[anti-psychologism]] in the [[historiography of philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;William R. Woodward, ''Hermann Lotze: An Intellectual Biography'', Cambridge University Press, 2015, pp. 74–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Koninklijk]]e Marechaussee''', the ''Royal Netherlands Marechaussee'', abbreviated to KMar, is one of the four Services of the armed forces of the [[Netherlands]]. It is a [[gendarmerie]] force performing military police and civil [[police]] duties.

==History==
The ''Corps de Maréchaussée'' was created by King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] to replace the [[French Gendarmerie]] on October 26, 1814. The word ''[[gendarmerie]]'' had gained a negative connotation, so William called the new force ''"marechaussée"'' (he forgot the first acute accent in the document). Maréchaussée is an alternate French word for ''gendarmerie''. At that time, the Marechaussee was a part of the army (''landmacht''). The Marechaussee was tasked with maintaining public order, law enforcement, and safeguarding the main roads. Although not specifically mentioned, this included police duties for the army. As such, the Marechaussee was part of the national police (''rijkspolitie'').

[[Image:Koninklijke Marechaussee busje.JPG|thumb|A Marechaussee van]]

The Marechaussee was the only police force in many small municipalities, such as [[Venlo]], especially in the southern provinces of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and [[North Brabant]] (former [[Generality Lands]]).

In 1908, Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]] assigned the Marechaussee the task of guarding the royal palaces, which had previously been done by [[gardener]]s. To this day, guarding a palace is called "''klompendienst''{{-"}} ([[Clog (shoe)|clog]] service).

On July 5, 1940, the [[Germany|German]] occupation government merged the Marechaussee with the ''rijksveldwacht'' and the ''gemeenteveldwacht''. This meant that the Marechaussee lost its military status and the [[wikt:predicate|predicate]] Royal. These changes did not apply to the Marechaussee outside occupied Dutch territory. About 200 ''marechaussees'' guarded the Royal Family and the Dutch government-in-exile, and provided military police services to the [[Princess Irene Brigade]], a brigade formed in the [[United Kingdom]], consisting of Dutchmen.

After [[World War II]], the Marechaussee was split into a ''[[Korps landelijke politiediensten|Korps Rijkspolitie]]'' (National Police Corps) (as a replacement of the ''rijksveldwacht'' and the ''gemeenteveldwacht'') and the ''Royal Marechaussee'', which regained its military status. The main tasks for the Marechaussee since then have been border protection, military police and guard duties.

On July 3, 1956, Princess [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] became patroness of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee.

In 1994, the national and municipal police forces were merged into the present 25 regional police forces and the ''[[Korps landelijke politiediensten]]'' (National Police Services Agency). The National Police transferred its airport police and security tasks (primarily [[Schiphol]]) to the Marechaussee.

In 1998, the Marechaussee became a separate Service within the armed forces.

In 2014, a team of 40 Dutch Military Police went to eastern [[Ukraine]] to assist the investigation into the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|shooting down of Malaysian airliner MH17]]. They provided security for the international team and assistance in collecting evidence from the crash site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28506109|title=Dutch military police in Ukraine to investigate flight MH17|publisher=[[BBC NEWS]]|date=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem==
[[Image:Springende granaat.jpg|100px|thumb| The Grenade]]
The emblem of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee is, as with many other gendarmerie forces, a flaming [[grenade]]. In the 17th century, a new weapon was introduced in [[Europe]]: the [[hand grenade]]. The soldiers who handled grenades were called grenadiers. They became an [[elite]] type of soldier in all European armies. In France, the grenade symbol was adopted by the gendarmerie, and this was imitated by similar forces throughout Europe.

The flaming grenade (but in this case within an eight-pointed star) was also the emblem of the ''Rijkspolitie''.

The present marechaussee is a police organisation with a military status, under the [[jurisdiction]] of the Ministry of Defense, but mostly working for the Ministry of Security and Justice and the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. The RNLM performs the following duties:

* assistance to and replacement by the Police
* fighting [[illegal immigration]]
* fighting [[Transnational crime|international crime]]
* guarding the [[national border]]s
* guarding the royal [[palace]]s and the house of the [[Dutch Prime Minister|Prime Minister]]
* [[military police]] functions for the [[Military of the Netherlands|Dutch Armed Forces]]
* [[riot control]] and protection
* security and police work at all civilian airports, notably [[Schiphol Airport]]
* VIP close protection including the [[Royal Family]] and high-ranking government officials
* Special Protection Assignments Brigade ([[Brigade Speciale Beveiligingsopdrachten|BSB]]), [[special forces]] for arrests, surveillance and protection
* KMOO, the [[Military Police]] Service

The first four units are territorial, other two have national rather than regional responsibilities.

==Ranks==
See [[Military ranks of the Dutch armed forces]]

==Equipment==
* [[Colt Canada C7 rifle#The Netherlands|Colt Canada C8NLD]]
* [[Glock 17]]
* [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK416]]
* [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]]
* [[FN MAG]] (only on [[AIFV]] armoured vehicles)

==Spelling==
In the course of time the two acute accents of the French spelling (Maréchaussée) were dropped. The lowest ranking personnel are referred to as marechaussees (without the capital M), a rank comparable to [[lance corporal]] and [[corporal]].

The '''SS Race and Settlement Main Office''', (''Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt der SS'', RuSHA), was the organization responsible for "safeguarding the racial 'purity' of the SS" within [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stengerhistorica.com/ArchivalResearch/RuSHA.htm] SS Collections: RuSHA (Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt) – Stenger Historica&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of its duties was to oversee the marriages of [[SS]] personnel in accordance with the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]]. After [[Heinrich Himmler]] introduced the "marriage order" on December 31, 1931, the RuSHA would only issue a permit to marry once detailed background investigations into the racial fitness of both prospective parents had been completed and proved both of them to be of Aryan descent back to 1800.&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991"&gt;{{cite book|author = Michael Burleigh | authorlink=Michael Burleigh| title = The Racial State: Germany 1933–1945 | date = 7 November 1991 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-39802-2|page = 84, 273, }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1991|pp=146, 576, 747}}

==Formation==
The RuSHA was founded in 1931 by ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Richard Walther Darré]], who later rose to the rank of SS-''[[Obergruppenführer]]''. In 1935, it was upgraded to an SS Main Office. Under its first director, Darré, it propagated the Nazi ideology of "Blood and Soil". Darré was dismissed by Himmler in 1938 and was succeeded by SS-''[[Gruppenführer]]'' [[Günther Pancke]], SS-''Gruppenführer'' [[Otto Hofmann]] in 1940, and [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]-''Gruppenführer'' [[Richard Hildebrandt]] in 1943.{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1991|p=747}}

The RuSHA was created in part to monitor Himmler's 1931 order that the marital decisions of unmarried [[SS]] men should be supervised by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi state]]. SS men would thereafter have to apply for a marriage permit three months before getting married so that the parents of the fiancée could be investigated to ensure her racial purity. With time, the marriage laws became less strict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stengerhistorica.com/ArchivalResearch/RuSHA.htm] SS Collections: RuSHA (Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt) – Stenger Historica&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, in December 1935 Himmler ordered the RuSHA to establish the [[Lebensborn]] network of maternity homes, whose purpose was "to accommodate and look after racially and genetically valuable expectant mothers." The RuSHA increasingly focused on processing SS marriage applications, genealogy, "racial-biological" investigations and the social welfare services of SS members.{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1991|pp=534, 747}}

==Organization==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1973-010-11, Schwester in einem Lebensbornheim.jpg|thumb|upright|Babies born during the SS [[Lebensborn]] program in 1943.]]
In 1935 the RuSHA consisted of seven departments ({{lang-de|Ämter or Amtsgruppen}}):
*'''''Amt Organisation und Verwaltungsamt''''' ({{lang-en|Organisation and Administration}})
*'''''Amt Rassenamt''''' (Race)
*'''''Amt Schulungsamt''''' (Education)
*'''''Amt Sippen und Heiratsamt''''' (Family and Marriage)
*'''''Amt Siedlungsamt''''' (Settlement)
*'''''Amt für Archiv und Zeitungswesen''''' (Records and Press)
*'''''Amt für Bevölkerungspolitik''''' (Population Policy)

In 1940 it was reorganized to create four main departments:
*'''''Verwaltungsamt''''' (Administration Office).
*'''''Rassenamt''''' (Racial Office), it selected future SS personnel and conducted racial selections.
*'''''Heiratsamt''''' (Marriage Office) it controlled the selection of suitable wives by SS men.
*'''''Siedlungsamt''''' (Settlement Office), it dealt with the settlement of discharged SS men, especially in the annexed eastern areas.

The Race and Settlement Departments were further divided into the ''Hauptabteilungen'' (Main Branches). One of these managed welfare and pensions in cooperation with the ''SS-Hauptfürsorge- und  Versorgungsamt'' (SS Main Welfare and Pension Department) at the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Reich Ministry of the Interior]].

==Racial policies==
{{see also|Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany}}
By 1937 more than 300 SS men had been expelled from the SS for violating Nazi race laws (''[[Rassenschande]]''), although an order later stated that they could remain if they were already married and could satisfy racial criteria. In November 1940, Himmler reinstated all SS personnel expelled under the marriage laws, provided they met racial requirements of the [[Nazi Party]].

Following the [[operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, the RuSHA worked in partnership with [[VOMI]] in the "[[germanization]]" of captured territory, monitoring of settler welfare, and the [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]] of [[Volksdeutsche|ethnic Germans]] in areas designated for settlement by the [[SS]], particularly in occupied Ukraine. This involved in part, the resetting of Germans in the Nazi occupied Eastern territories and ejecting the native families from those lands. 

The RuSHA was also an advisory and executive office for all questions of racial selection. Racial examinations were performed by ''Rasse und Siedlungs'' (RUS) leaders or their racial examiners (''Eignungsprüfer'') in connection with:

* Cases where sexual intercourse had occurred between Eastern European POWs or workers and Germans
* Children born to Eastern European workers
* Classification of people of German descent
* Selection of enemy nationals, particularly Poles, for slave labour and Germanization
* Kidnapping of children suitable for Germanization
* Population transfers
* The persecution and liquidation of Jews

The RuSHA also employed [[Josef Mengele]] for a short time from November 1940 to early 1941, in Department II of its Family Office, where he was responsible for "care of genetic health" and "genetic health tests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schmuhl| first = Hans-Walter | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = The Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics, 1927–1945: Crossing Boundaries | publisher = Springer| year = 2008 | location =  | nopp =  | page = 364 | url =  | isbn = 1-4020-6599-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to become one of the team of doctors responsible for the selection of victims to be killed in the [[gas chamber]]s and for performing deadly [[Nazi human experimentation|human experiments]] on prisoners at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=227}}

==Postwar==
[[File:RuSHA Trial Indictment.jpg|thumb|upright|Some of the 14 defendants in the [[RuSHA Trial]] at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] read the indictments against them in July 1947.]]
In July 1947, 14 officials from the organization were indicted in the [[RuSHA Trial]] and tried by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]]. All were charged with crimes against humanity, war crimes and membership of a criminal organization (the SS). All but one (who was acquitted on the two more serious charges) were found guilty and sentenced to between three and 25 years imprisonment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11498">In the United Kingdom, government policy requires that staff undergo '''security vetting''' in order to gain access to government information.

The government uses four levels&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp|Annex C, p. 24}} of personnel security controls depending on the [[Government Security Classifications Policy|level of assurance]] required. Three of these levels are types of national security vetting clearance.&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp|Annex B}}
 
Vetting is intended to assure government bodies that the individual has not been involved in espionage, terrorism, sabotage or actions intended to overthrow or undermine Parliamentary democracy by political, industrial or violent means.  It also assures the department that the individual has not been a member of, or associated with, an organisation which has advocated such activities or has demonstrated a lack of reliability through dishonesty, lack of integrity or behaviour. Finally, the process assures the department that the individual will not be subject to pressure or improper influence through past behaviour or personal circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, Written answers 15 Dec 1994 [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199495/cmhansrd/1994-12-15/Writtens-4.html Hansard online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vetting is usually carried out by [[United Kingdom Security Vetting]] (UKSV).&lt;ref name="UKSV_webpage"&gt;{{cite web |title=Guidance United Kingdom Security Vetting |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/security-vetting-and-clearance |website=GOV.UK |publisher=Her Majesty's Government |accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UKSV was created in January 2017 by combining [[DBS National Security Vetting]] (DBS NSV) and [[FCO Services]] National Security Vetting (FCOS NSV).&lt;ref name="UKSV_webpage"/&gt; This change was an outcome of the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/555607/2015_Strategic_Defence_and_Security_Review.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7.17}}

==Types of personnel security check==

===Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)===

The Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) checks are normally performed when a person is recruited.

All those with access to government assets are subject on recruitment to the requirements of the Baseline Personnel Security Standard. This includes all applicants for employment in the civil service and armed forces and applies to both permanent and temporary staff and private sector employees working on government contracts, with access to government assets.

The Baseline Personnel Security Standard requires the verification of the following four elements:
# Identity&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp|7(a)}}
# Employment history (past three years)&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp|7(b)}}
# Nationality and immigration status&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp|7(c)}}
# Criminal record (unspent convictions only)&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp|7(d)}}

A reasonable account of any significant periods (a total of 6 months or more in the past 3 years) spent abroad.&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp |Annex B}} Prospective employees who have recently come to the UK or lived abroad may be asked to provide overseas police certificates of good conduct.&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp|7(d)}}

BPSS&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp|Annex B}}
* Allows access to UK OFFICIAL assets and occasional access to UK SECRET assets
* Is required to work in areas where SECRET and TOP SECRET information may be overheard 
* Allows individuals who require it, access to the Public Services Network (PSN)

Employers may initiate the following incremental national security vetting checks on recruits after performing the BPSS check.

===Counter Terrorist Check (CTC)===

A Counter Terrorist Check (CTC) is required for individuals who are employed in posts that:&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security&gt;{{cite book|title=HMG Personnel Security Controls (Version 3.0)|year=2017|publisher=Cabinet Office|location=www.gov.uk|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmg-personnel-security-controls|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |Annex B}} 
* Involve proximity to public figures assessed to be at particular risk from terrorist attack.
* Give access to information or material assessed to be of value to terrorists. However, it is not designed to manage access to sensitive information.
* Involve unescorted access to certain military, civil, industrial or commercial establishments assessed to be at particular risk from terrorist attack.

The process for CTC clearance includes:
* BPSS check;
* Completion of a security clearance questionnaire by the candidate;
* Checks against UK criminal records covering both spent and unspent convictions;
* Checks against [[MI5|Security Service (MI5)]] records;
* It may also include an interview.

A CTC clearance must be formally reviewed after ten years (five years for non-List X Contractors).&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp |Annex B}}

In the transport sector security vetting requirements, including for Counter Terrorist Check, is regulated by the [[Department of Transport]].&lt;ref name=CTC_DfT&gt;{{cite web|title=National security vetting in the regulated transport industry|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-security-vetting-in-the-regulated-transport-industry|work=GOV.UK website|publisher=Her Majesty's Government|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CTC is required for police officers and many associated staff.&lt;ref name=CTC_Police&gt;{{cite web|title=P04e National Security Vetting|url=http://www.kent.police.uk/about_us/policies/legal-professional/sops/p04e.html|publisher=Kent Police|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security Check (SC)===

A Security Check (SC) is the most widely held level of security clearance.&lt;ref name="NSV_Leaflet"/&gt; SC is required for posts involving regular and uncontrolled access to SECRET assets and/or occasional, supervised access to TOP SECRET assets,&lt;ref name="NSV_Leaflet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Subjects information leaflet|publisher=Ministry of Defence|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dv-information-leaflet|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for individuals who:&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp|Annex B}}
* While not in such posts, will be in a position to directly or indirectly bring about the same degree of damage. 
* Will have sufficient knowledge to obtain a comprehensive picture of a SECRET plan, policy or project. 
* Are being considered for employment where it would not be possible to make reasonable career progress without security clearance for access to SECRET assets. 
* Require access to certain levels of classified material originating from another country or international organisation.

The process for SC clearance includes:
* Successful completion of the Baseline Personnel Security Standard. 
* Completion, by the individual, of a Security Questionnaire. 
* A departmental/company records check which will include e.g. personal files, staff reports, sick leave returns and security records. 
* A check of both spent and unspent criminal records. 
* A check of credit and financial history with a credit reference agency.
* A check of Security Service (MI5) records.
* It may also include an interview.

Checks may extend to third parties included on the security questionnaire.

An SC security clearance must be formally reviewed after ten years (seven years for non-List X contractors) or at any time up to that point at the discretion of the vetting authority.&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp |Annex B}}

===Enhanced Security Check (eSC)===

This is similar to an SC but also includes a financial questionnaire. 
===Developed Vetting (DV)===

DV is the most detailed and comprehensive form of security clearance in UK government. It is needed for posts that require individuals to have frequent and uncontrolled access to TOP SECRET assets, or require any access to TOP SECRET codeword material. It is also required for individuals who: 
* While not in such posts, will be in a position to directly or indirectly bring about the same degree of damage. 
* Require frequent and uncontrolled access to Category I nuclear material. 
* Require access to certain levels of classified material originating from another country or international organisation.

The process for DV clearance includes:
* BPSS check. 
* Completion, by the individual, of a Security Questionnaire, a DV Supplement and Financial Questionnaire. 
* A check of both spent and unspent criminal records. 
* A check of credit and financial history with a credit reference agency. 
* A check of Security Service (MI5) records.
* A full review of personal finances. 
* A detailed interview conducted by a vetting officer. 
* Further enquiries, including interviews with referees conducted by a vetting officer.

A DV security clearance must be reviewed every seven years or at any time up to those points at the discretion of the vetting authority.&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp |Annex B}}

===Enhanced Developed Vetting (eDV)===

Enhanced Developed Vetting requires additional in-depth interviews, which may be necessary for certain roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.securityclearedexpo.com/national-security-vetting/|title=National Security Vetting|work=Security Cleared Expo|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other UK clearances==

In addition to national security clearances, other types of roles and organisations stipulate a need for clearances, including:
*Vulnerable group access (including children), as operated by the [[Disclosure and Barring Service]] (DBS), replacing former Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) and [[Independent Safeguarding Authority]] (ISA) checks.
*Law enforcement, with a hierarchy of Police Personnel Vetting (PPV) and Non-Police Personnel Vetting (NPPV) levels, which are broadly aligned with national security clearance levels,{{fact|date=January 2018}} but differ in focusing predominantly on susceptibility to criminality.

==Change of personal circumstances==

A change of personal circumstances (CPC) questionnaire has to be submitted when an SC, DV or CTC clearance holder is "marrying, remarrying, entering into a civil partnership, setting up a stable unmarried relationship which includes living with someone as a couple". DV clearance holders also have to report the arrival of new "co-residents" such as a lodger or flatmate. When two cleared persons marry both have to submit CPC questionnaires.&lt;ref name="UKSV_webpage"/&gt;

==Transfer of a clearance==

A request can be made to transfer national security clearances between organisations, providing they have not expired. Transfers are requested by the "new employing sponsor". Transfers can be the same level of clearance or lower. No more than twelve months must have elapsed since the holder left the organisation for which the clearance was originally granted and no more than six months living overseas. New completed change of circumstances questionnaires, to bring the UKSV records up to date, may be required.&lt;ref name="UKSV_webpage"/&gt; The new sponsor reviews the details of the clearance and decides if it is acceptable for the specific new role.&lt;ref name=Personnel_Security/&gt;{{rp|44}}

[[File:SouthEast Asia fires Oct 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|Slash-and-burn based shifting cultivation is a widespread historical practice in southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, J. E. (1966), Shifting cultivation in southeastern Asia (Vol. 19), University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520035171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above is a satellite image of Sumatra and Borneo showing shift cultivation fires from October 2006.]]

'''Shifting cultivation''' is an [[agricultural]] system in which plots of land are cultivated temporarily, then abandoned and allowed to revert to their natural vegetation while the cultivator moves on to another plot. The period of cultivation is usually terminated when the soil shows signs of exhaustion or, more commonly, when the field is overrun by weeds. The length of time that a field is cultivated is usually shorter than the period over which the land is allowed to regenerate by lying [[fallow]]. This technique is often used in [[LEDCs]] (Less Economically Developed Countries) or LICs (Low Income Countries). In some areas, cultivators use a practice of [[slash-and-burn]] as one element of their [[farming]] cycle. Others employ land clearing without any burning, and some cultivators are purely [[human migration|migratory]] and do not use any cyclical method on a given plot.  Sometimes no slashing at all is needed where regrowth is purely of [[grasses]], an outcome not uncommon when soils are near exhaustion and need to lie fallow.
In shifting agriculture, after two or three years of producing vegetable and grain crops on cleared land, the migrants abandon it for another plot. Land is often cleared by [[slash-and-burn]] methods—trees, bushes and forests are cleared by slashing, and the remaining vegetation is burnt. The ashes add potash to the soil. Then the seeds are sown after the rains.

==Political ecology==

Shifting cultivation is a form of [[agriculture]] or a cultivation system, in which, at any particular point in time, a minority of 'fields' are in cultivation and a majority are in various stages of natural re-growth. Over time, fields are cultivated for a relatively short time, and allowed to recover, or are [[fallow]]ed, for a relatively long time. Eventually a previously cultivated field will be cleared of the natural vegetation and planted in [[agriculture|crops]] again. Fields in established and stable shifting cultivation systems are cultivated and fallowed cyclically.This type of farming is called jhumming in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sa.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/Jhumming.pdf |title=Jhumming, a traditional lifestyle than merely a cultivation method |date=2010-04-25 |website=http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/ |publisher=India Environment Portal |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallow fields are not unproductive. During the fallow period, shifting cultivators use the [[crop rotation|successive vegetation]] species widely for [[timber]] for fencing and construction, [[firewood]], [[thatch]]ing, ropes, [[clothing]], [[tool]]s, carrying devices and [[medicine]]s. It is common for fruit and [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] trees to be planted in fallow fields to the extent that parts of some fallows are in fact [[orchard]]s. Soil-enhancing [[shrub]] or tree species may be planted or protected from slashing or burning in fallows. Many of these species have been shown to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]]. Fallows commonly contain plants that attract [[bird]]s and animals and are important for [[hunting]]. But perhaps most importantly, tree fallows protect soil against physical [[erosion]] and draw [[nutrient]]s to the surface from deep in the soil profile.

The relationship between the time the land is [[Agriculture|cultivate]]d and the time it is fallowed are critical to the stability of shifting cultivation systems. These parameters determine whether or not the shifting cultivation system as a whole suffers a net loss of nutrients over time. A system in which there is a net loss of nutrients with each cycle will eventually lead to a degradation of resources unless actions are taken to arrest the losses. In some cases [[soil conservation|soil]] can be irreversibly exhausted (including erosion as well as nutrient loss) in less than a decade.

The longer a field is cropped, the greater the loss of [[soil organic matter]], [[cation-exchange]]-capacity and in [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]], the greater the increase in [[acidity]], the more likely soil porosity and [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] capacity is reduced and the greater the loss of seeds of naturally occurring plant species from [[soil seed bank]]s. In a stable shifting cultivation system, the fallow is long enough for the natural vegetation to recover to the state that it was in before it was cleared, and for the soil to recover to the condition it was in before cropping began. During fallow periods soil temperatures are lower, wind and water erosion is much reduced, [[nutrient cycling]] becomes closed again, nutrients are extracted from the subsoil, soil [[fauna]] decreases, acidity is reduced, soil structure, texture and moisture characteristics improve and seed banks are replenished.

The secondary forests created by shifting cultivation are commonly richer in plant and animal resources useful to humans than primary forests, even though they are much less bio-diverse. Shifting cultivators view the forest as an agricultural landscape of fields at various stages in a regular cycle. People unused to living in forests cannot see the fields for the trees. Rather they perceive an apparently chaotic landscape in which trees are cut and burned randomly and so they characterise shifting cultivation as ephemeral or 'pre-agricultural', as 'primitive' and as a stage to be progressed beyond. Shifting agriculture is none of these things. Stable shifting cultivation systems are highly variable, closely adapted to [[Microclimate|micro-environment]]s and are carefully managed by [[farmer]]s during both the cropping and fallow stages. Shifting cultivators may possess a highly developed knowledge and understanding of their local environments and of the crops and native plant species they exploit. Complex and highly adaptive land tenure systems sometimes exist under shifting cultivation. Introduced crops for food and as cash have been skillfully integrated into some shifting cultivation systems. Its disadvantages include the high initial cost, as manual labour is required.

==In Europe==

Shifting cultivation was still being practised as a viable and stable form of agriculture in many parts of Europe and east into [[Siberia]] at the end of the 19th century and in some places well into the 20th century. In the [[Ruhr]] in the late 1860s a forest-field rotation system known as Reutbergwirtschaft[https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reutbergwirtschaft] was using a 16-year cycle of clearing, cropping and fallowing with trees to produce bark for [[tanneries]], wood for charcoal and rye for flour (Darby 1956, 200). Swidden farming was practised in Siberia at least until the 1930s, using specially selected varieties of "swidden-rye" (Steensberg 1993, 98). In Eastern Europe and Northern Russia the main swidden crops were turnips, barley, flax, rye, wheat, oats, radishes and [[millet]]. Cropping periods were usually one year, but were extended to two or three years on very favourable soils. Fallow periods were between 20 and 40 years (Linnard 1970, 195). In Finland in 1949, Steensberg (1993, 111) observed the clearing and burning of a {{convert|60000|m2|acre}} [[swidden]] 440&amp;nbsp;km north of Helsinki. Birch and pine trees had been cleared over a period of a year and the logs sold for cash. A fallow of [[alder]] (Alnus) was encouraged to improve soil conditions. After the burn, turnip was sown for sale and for cattle feed. Shifting cultivation was disappearing in this part of Finland because of a loss of agricultural labour to the industries of the towns. Steensberg (1993, 110-152) provides eye-witness descriptions of shifting cultivation being practised in Sweden in the 20th century, and in Estonia, Poland, the Caucasus, Serbia, Bosnia, Hungary, Switzerland, Austria and Germany in the 1930s to the 1950s.

That these agricultural practices survived from the Neolithic into the middle of the 20th century amidst the sweeping changes that occurred in Europe over that period, suggests they were adaptive and in themselves, were not massively destructive of the environments in which they were practiced. 
The earliest written accounts of forest destruction in Southern Europe begin around 1000 BC in the histories of [[Homer]], [[Thucydides]] and [[Plato]] and in [[Strabo]]'s [[Geographica|Geography]]. Forests were exploited for ship building, and urban development, the manufacture of casks, pitch and charcoal, as well as being cleared for agriculture. The intensification of trade and as a result of warfare, increased the demand for ships which were manufactured completely from forest products. Although goat herding is singled out as an important cause of [[environmental degradation]], a more important cause of forest destruction was the practice in some places of granting ownership rights to those who clear felled forests and brought the land into permanent cultivation. Evidence that circumstances other than agriculture were the major causes for forest destruction was the recovery of tree cover in many parts of the Roman empire from 400 BC to around 500 AD following the collapse of Roman economy and industry. Darby observes that by 400 AD "land that had once been tilled became derelict and overgrown" and quotes [[Lactantius]] who wrote that in many places "cultivated land became forest" (Darby 1956, 186). The other major cause of forest destruction in the Mediterranean environment with its hot dry summers were wild fires that became more common following human interference in the forests.

In Central and Northern Europe the use of stone tools and fire in agriculture is well established in the [[palynological]] and archaeological record from the Neolithic. Here, just as in Southern Europe, the demands of more intensive agriculture and the invention of the plough, trading, mining and smelting, tanning, building and construction in the growing towns and constant warfare, including the demands of naval shipbuilding, were more important forces behind the destruction of the forests than was shifting cultivation.

By the Middle Ages in Europe, large areas of forest were being cleared and converted into arable land in association with the development of [[feudal]] tenurial practices. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, the demands of iron smelters for charcoal, increasing industrial developments and the discovery and expansion of colonial empires as well as incessant warfare that increased the demand for shipping to levels never previously reached, all combined to [[deforestation|deforest]] Europe. With the loss of the forest, so shifting cultivation became restricted to the peripheral places of Europe, where permanent agriculture was uneconomic, transport costs constrained logging or terrain prevented the use of draught animals or tractors. It has disappeared from even these refuges since 1945, as agriculture has become increasingly capital intensive, rural areas have become depopulated and the remnant European forests themselves have been revalued economically and socially. It is for crop only not for livestock.

==Simple societies and environmental change==
[[File:Bekas areal terbakar (15).JPG|thumb|Shifting cultivation in Indonesia. A new crop is sprouting through the burnt soil.]]
A growing body of  palynological evidence finds that simple human societies brought about extensive changes to their environments before the establishment of any sort of state, feudal or capitalist, and before the development of large scale mining, smelting or shipbuilding industries. In these societies agriculture was the driving force in the economy and shifting cultivation was the most common type of agriculture practiced. By examining the relationships between social and economic change and agricultural change in these societies, insights can be gained on contemporary social and economic change and global environment change, and the place of shifting cultivation in those relationship.

As early as 1930 questions about relationships between the rise and fall of the [[Mayan civilization]] of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and shifting cultivation were raised and continue to be debated today. Archaeological evidence suggests the development of Mayan society and economy began around 250 AD. A mere 700 years later it reached its apogee, by which time the population may have reached 2,000,000 people. There followed a precipitous decline that left the great cities and ceremonial centres vacant and overgrown with jungle vegetation. The causes of this decline are uncertain; but warfare and the exhaustion of agricultural land are commonly cited (Meggers 1954; Dumond 1961; Turner 1974). More recent work suggests the Maya may have, in suitable places, developed irrigation systems and more intensive agricultural practices (Humphries 1993).

Similar paths appear to have been followed by Polynesian settlers in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, who within 500 years of their arrival around 1100 AD turned substantial areas from forest into scrub and fern and in the process caused the elimination of numerous species of birds and animals (Kirch and Hunt 1997). In the restricted environments of the Pacific islands, including Fiji and Hawaii, early extensive erosion and change of vegetation is presumed to have been caused by shifting cultivation on slopes. Soils washed from slopes were deposited in valley bottoms as a rich, swampy alluvium. These new environments were then exploited to develop intensive, irrigated fields. The change from shifting cultivation to intensive irrigated fields occurred in association with a rapid growth in population and the development of elaborate and highly stratified chiefdoms (Kirch 1984). In the larger, temperate latitude, islands of New Zealand the presumed course of events took a different path. There the stimulus for population growth was the hunting of large birds to extinction, during which time forests in drier areas were destroyed by burning, followed the development of intensive agriculture in favorable environments, based mainly on [[sweet potato]] (Ipomoea batatas) and a reliance on the gathering of two main wild plant species in less favorable environments. These changes, as in the smaller islands, were accompanied by population growth, the competition for the occupation of the best environments, complexity in social organization, and [[endemic warfare]] (Anderson 1997).

The record of humanly induced changes in environments is longer in New Guinea than in most places. Agricultural activities probably began 5,000 to 9,000 years ago. However, the most spectacular changes, in both societies and environments, are believed to have occurred in the central highlands of the island within the last 1,000 years, in association with the introduction of a crop new to New Guinea, the sweet potato (Golson 1982a; 1982b). One of the most striking signals of the relatively recent intensification of agriculture is the sudden increase in sedimentation rates in small lakes.

The root question posed by these and the numerous other examples that could be cited of simple societies that have intensified their agricultural systems in association with increases in population and social complexity is not whether or how shifting cultivation was responsible for the extensive changes to landscapes and environments. Rather it is why simple societies of shifting cultivators in the tropical forest of Yucatán, or the highlands of New Guinea, began to grow in numbers and to develop stratified and sometimes complex social hierarchies?

At first sight, the greatest stimulus to the intensification of a shifting cultivation system is a growth in population. If no other changes occur within the system, for each extra person to be fed from the system, a small extra amount of land must be cultivated. The total amount of land available is the land being presently cropped and all of the land in fallow. If the area occupied by the system is not expanded into previously unused land, then either the cropping period must be extended or the fallow period shortened.

At least two problems exist with the population growth hypothesis. First, population growth in most pre-industrial shifting cultivator societies has been shown to be very low over the long term. Second, no human societies are known where people work only to eat. People engage in social relations with each other and agricultural produce is used in the conduct of these relationships.

These relationships are the focus of two attempts to understand the nexus between human societies and their environments, one an explanation of a particular situation and the other a general exploration of the problem.

===1. Feedback loops===
In a study of the Duna in the Southern Highlands of New Guinea, a group in the process of moving from shifting cultivation into permanent field agriculture post sweet potato, Modjeska (1982) argued for the development of two "self amplifying feed back loops" of ecological and social causation. The trigger to the changes were very slow population growth and the slow expansion of agriculture to meet the demands of this growth. This set in motion the first feedback loop, the "use-value" loop. As more forest was cleared there was a decline in wild food resources and protein produced from hunting, which was substituted for by an increase in domestic pig raising. An increase in domestic pigs required a further expansion in agriculture. The greater protein available from the larger number of pigs increased human fertility and survival rates and resulted in faster population growth.

The outcome of the operation of the two loops, one bringing about ecological change and the other social and economic change, is an expanding and intensifying agricultural system, the conversion of forest to grassland, a population growing at an increasing rate and expanding geographically and a society that is increasing in complexity and stratification.

===2. Resources are cultural appraisals===
The second attempt to explain the relationships between simple agricultural societies and their environments is that of Ellen (1982, 252–270). Ellen does not attempt to separate use-values from social production. He argues that almost all of the materials required by humans to live (with perhaps the exception of air) are obtained through social relations of production and that these relations proliferate and are modified in numerous ways. The values that humans attribute to items produced from the environment arise out of cultural arrangements and not from the objects themselves, a restatement of [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Sauer]]'s dictum that "resources are cultural appraisals". Humans frequently translate actual objects into culturally conceived forms, an example being the translation by the Duna of the pig into an item of compensation and redemption. As a result, two fundamental processes underlie the ecology of human social systems: First, the obtaining of materials from the environment and their alteration and circulation through social relations, and second, giving the material a value which will affect how important it is to obtain it, circulate it or alter it. Environmental pressures are thus mediated through social relations.

Transitions in ecological systems and in social systems do not proceed at the same rate. The rate of phylogenetic change is determined mainly by natural selection and partly by human interference and adaptation, such as for example, the domestication of a wild species. Humans however have the ability to learn and to communicate their knowledge to each other and across generations. If most social systems have the tendency to increase in complexity they will, sooner or later, come into conflict with, or into "contradiction" (Friedman 1979, 1982) with their environments. What happens around the point of "contradiction" will determine the extent of the environmental degradation that will occur. Of particular importance is the ability of the society to change, to invent or to innovate technologically and sociologically, in order to overcome the "contradiction" without incurring continuing environmental degradation, or social disintegration.

An economic study of what occurs at the points of conflict with specific reference to shifting cultivation is that of [[Esther Boserup]] (1965). Boserup argues that low intensity farming, extensive shifting cultivation for example, has lower labor costs than more [[intensive farming]] systems. This assertion remains controversial. She also argues that given a choice, a human group will always choose the technique which has the lowest absolute labor cost rather than the highest yield. But at the point of conflict, yields will have become unsatisfactory. Boserup argues, contra [[Malthus]], that rather than population always overwhelming resources, that humans will invent a new agricultural technique or adopt an existing innovation that will boost yields and that is adapted to the new environmental conditions created by the degradation which has occurred already, even though they will pay for the increases in higher labor costs. Examples of such changes are the adoption of new higher yielding crops, the exchanging of a digging stick for a hoe, or a hoe for a plough, or the development of irrigation systems. The controversy over Boserup's proposal is in part over whether intensive systems are more costly in labor terms, and whether humans will bring about change in their agricultural systems before environmental degradation forces them to.

The estimated rate of deforestation in [[Southeast Asia]] in 1990 was 34,000&amp;nbsp;km² per year (FAO 1990, quoted in Potter 1993). In [[Indonesia]] alone it was estimated 13,100&amp;nbsp;km² per year were being lost, 3,680&amp;nbsp;km² per year from [[Sumatra]] and 3,770&amp;nbsp;km² from [[Kalimantan]], of which 1,440&amp;nbsp;km² were due to the fires of 1982 to 1983. Since those estimates were made huge fires have ravaged Indonesian forests during the 1997 to 1998 [[El Niño]] associated drought.

Shifting cultivation was assessed by the FAO to be one of the causes of [[deforestation]] while [[logging]] was not. The apparent discrimination against shifting cultivators caused a confrontation between FAO and environmental groups, who saw the FAO supporting commercial logging interests against the rights of indigenous people (Potter 1993, 108). Other independent studies of the problem note that despite lack of government control over forests and the dominance of a political elite in the logging industry, the causes of deforestation are more complex.  The loggers have provided paid employment to former subsistence farmers. One of the outcomes of cash incomes has been rapid population growth among [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] groups of former shifting cultivators that has placed pressure on their traditional long [[fallow]] farming systems. Many farmers have taken advantage of the improved road access to urban areas by planting cash crops, such as rubber or pepper as noted above. Increased cash incomes often are spent on chain saws, which have enabled larger areas to be cleared for cultivation. Fallow periods have been reduced and cropping periods extended. Serious poverty elsewhere in the country has brought thousands of land-hungry settlers into the cut-over forests along the logging roads. The [[settler]]s practice what appears to be shifting cultivation but which is in fact a one-cycle [[slash and burn]] followed by continuous cropping, with no intention to long fallow. Clearing of trees and the permanent cultivation of fragile [[soil]]s in a tropical environment with little attempt to replace lost [[nutrient]]s may cause rapid degradation of the fragile soils.

The loss of forest in [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], and the [[Philippines]] during the 1990s was preceded by major ecosystem disruptions in [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] in the 1970s and 1980s caused by warfare. Forests were sprayed with [[defoliant]]s, thousands of rural forest dwelling people uproots from their homes and moved and roads driven into previously isolated areas. The loss of the [[tropical forest]]s of [[Southeast Asia]] is the particular outcome of the general possible outcomes described by Ellen (see above) when small local ecological and social systems become part of larger system. When the previous relatively stable ecological relationships are destabilized, degradation can occur rapidly. Similar descriptions of the loss of forest and destruction of fragile ecosystems could be provided from the Amazon Basin, by large scale state sponsored colonization forest land (Becker 1995, 61) or from the Central [[Africa]] where what endemic armed conflict is destabilizing rural settlement and farming communities on a massive scale.

==Comparison with other ecological phenomena==

In the tropical developing world, shifting cultivation in its many diverse forms, remains a pervasive practice. Shifting cultivation was one of the very first forms of agriculture practiced by humans and its survival into the modern world suggests that it is a flexible and highly adaptive means of production. However, it is also a grossly misunderstood practice. Many casual observers cannot see past the clearing and burning of standing forest and do not perceive often ecologically stable cycles of cropping and fallowing. Nevertheless, shifting cultivation systems are particularly susceptible to rapid increases in population and to economic and social change in the larger world around them. The blame for the destruction of forest resources is often laid on shifting cultivators. But the forces bringing about the rapid loss of tropical forests at the end of the 20th century are the same forces that led to the destruction of the forests of Europe, urbanization, industrialization, increased affluence, populational growth and geographical expansion and the application the latest technology to extract ever more resources from the environment in pursuit of wealth and political power by competing groups. However we must know that those who practice Agriculture are at the receiving end of the social stratum.

Studies of small, isolated and pre-capitalist groups and their relationships with their environments suggests that the roots of the contemporary problem lie deep in human behavioral patterns, for even in these simple societies, competition and conflict can be identified as the main force driving them into contradiction with their environments.

==Alternative practice in the pre-Columbian Amazon basin==

[[Slash-and-char]], as opposed to [[slash-and-burn]], may create self-perpetuating soil fertility that supports sedentary agriculture, but the society so sustained may still be overturned, as above (''see'' article at [[Terra preta]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2919">'''Six-Year Plan''' (1950–1955) was the second - after the [[Three-Year Plan]] (1947–1949) - [[central planning|centralized]] [[Soviet plan|plan]] of the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. It concentrated on increasing the [[heavy industry]] sector.

By 1950 the Polish government was dominated by Stalinist hardliners, such as [[Hilary Minc]], and liberal economists responsible for creation of the [[Three-Year Plan]] were no longer influencing government policy. The Six-Year Plan, designed to bring the [[economy of Poland]] in line with the [[Soviet economy]], concentrated on heavy industrialization, with projects such as [[Nowa Huta]]. The plan was accepted by the [[Sejm]] on July 21, 1950. Later on, it was modified several times, and never fully completed. 

Polish society paid a heavy price for badly thought-out and quick industrialization. Living standards were reduced, since investments in other fields, such as construction, were cut. In agriculture, the idea of [[collectivization]] was promoted, to the protests of Polish farmers. The plan was fashioned after similar Soviet plans, and was based on certain Soviet-style principles, such as central planning of economy, limiting the so-called Capitalist elements, and close cooperation with other Eastern Bloc nations. New urban districts were built in big cities, attracting residents of overpopulated villages. At the same time, however, the balance between supply and demand deepened, and shortages of basic products were common. As a result, [[rationing]] was re-introduced in the early 1950s. 

The only real achievement of the Six-Year Plan was quick development of heavy industry. At the same time, however, other fields of Polish economy, such as services and food industry, remained underdeveloped, as all state funds were directed at construction of shipyards, steel plants, chemical plants and car factories. Among major investments of the plan are:

* [[Skawina]] Aluminum Factory,
* development of [[Oswiecim]] Chemical Works (formerly [[Monowitz Buna Werke|Buna Werke]]),
* development of [[Zaklady Azotowe Kedzierzyn]] (formerly [[IG Farben]] Heydebreck),
* development of Synthetic Fibres Plant Stilon [[Gorzow Wielkopolski]] (formerly IG Farben-Werks Landsberg (Warthe)),
* Shoe Factory at [[Nowy Targ]],
* [[Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks|Lenin Steelworks]] at [[Nowa Huta]],
* [[Warsaw]] Steelworks,
* [[FSO Warszawa]],
* [[FSC Lublin]],
* [[FSC Star]] at [[Starachowice]],
* [[Wierzbica, Radom County|Wierzbica]] Cement Plant,
* development of [[Jaworzno Power Station]],
* development of [[Czestochowa]] Steelworks,
* development of [[Gdansk Shipyard]] (formerly [[Schichau-Werft]] and [[Danziger Werft]]),
* development of [[Szczecin Shipyard]] (formerly [[AG Vulcan Stettin]]).

==Abortion==
===Before 2016===
Trump's views on [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]] have changed significantly between 1999 when he was "very" [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]] and would neither ban abortion nor "[[partial-birth abortion]]", and his 2016 presidential campaign where he repeatedly described himself as [[pro-life]] (more specifically "pro-life with exceptions"), suggested that women who have abortions should face some sort of punishment (a view he quickly retracted), and pledged to appoint pro-life justices to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="AmiraDifferences"&gt;Dan Amira, [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/02/trump_through_the_years_1.html Donald Trump vs. Donald Trump: The Difference a Decade Makes], ''New York'' (February 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiamondAbortion"&gt;Jeremy Diamond, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/26/politics/donald-trump-abortion/ Trump deflects specifics when it comes to abortion position], CNN (January 26, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/texas/article/2016/feb/17/ted-cruz-ad-assailed-trump-leaves-out-trumps-decla/|title=[VIDEO]Ted Cruz ad, assailed by Trump, leaves out Trump's declared shift on abortion|website=PolitiFact Texas|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oct1999"&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-in-1999-i-am-very-pro-choice-480297539914 Trump in 1999: 'I am Very Pro-Choice'], NBC News (October 24, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":67" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":68" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/30/politics/donald-trump-abortion-positions/index.html|title=Donald Trump's 3 positions on abortion in 3 hours|accessdate=October 20, 2016|work=[[CNN]] |first=Gregory|last=Krieg|date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1999, Trump said, "I am very pro-choice" and "I believe in choice."&lt;ref name="Oct1999" /&gt; He said that he hated the "concept of abortion," but would not ban abortion or the procedure sometimes called "partial-birth abortion."&lt;ref name="Oct1999" /&gt; Later that year, Trump gave interviews stating "I'm totally pro-choice" and "I want to see the abortion issue removed from politics.

While campaigning for the presidency in 2016, Trump stated "I'm pro-life and I've been pro-life a long time" and acknowledged that he had "evolved" on the issue.&lt;ref name="DiamondAbortion"/&gt; CNN reported that Trump "dodged questions testing the specificity of those views."&lt;ref name="DiamondAbortion"/&gt; In August 2015, Trump said that he supported a [[Government shutdown in the United States|government shutdown]] over federal funding for [[Planned Parenthood]] (which receives federal funding for the health services it provides to 2.7 million people annually, but is barred by federal law from using federal funds for abortion-related procedures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeremy Diamond|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/04/politics/donald-trump-government-shutdown-planned-parenthood/|title=Trump: I would shut down government over Planned Parenthood |date=August 4, 2015|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, Trump said that Planned Parenthood should not be funded "as long as you have the abortion going on," but acknowledged that "Planned Parenthood has done very good work for many, many -- for millions of women."&lt;ref name="Gass"&gt;Nick Gass, [http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/donald-trump-truth-teller-planned-parenthood-super-tuesday-220090 Trump on Planned Parenthood: 'I am a truth teller'], ''Politico'' (March 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Planned Parenthood said in a statement that "Trump presidency would be a disaster for women" and criticized Trump's claim that "he'd be great for women while in the same breath pledging to block them from accessing care at Planned Parenthood."&lt;ref name="Gass"/&gt;

In an interview later that month, Trump acknowledged that there must be "some form" of punishment for women if abortion were made illegal in the U.S. Trump issued a statement later that day reversing his position from earlier by saying, "the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman."&lt;ref name=":68"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump abortion comments spark outrage on both sides|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/03/30/donald-trump-abortion/82443528/|work=[[USA Today]]|date=March 30, 2016|author=Josh Hafner &amp; Kevin Johnson|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/30/politics/donald-trump-abortion-town-hall/|work=[[CNN]]|date=March 30, 2016|author=Jeremy Diamond|accessdate=May 10, 2016|title=Trump reverses statement on women and abortion after outcry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donald J.

===Presidency===
In his first interview following his designation as president-elect, Trump affirmed his pledge to appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices. He said that if ''Roe v. Wade'' were overturned, the issue would be returned to the states, and that if some states outlawed abortion, a woman would "have to go to another state" to obtain an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-abortion_us_58291447e4b02d21bbc955b8|title=Donald Trump: Women Will 'Have To Go To Another State' For Abortions If Roe v.

In January 24, days after being sworn in, Trump issued an executive order reinstating the [[Mexico City policy]] (also called the "global gag rule"). Under the policy, international [[non-governmental organization]]s that "offer or promote abortions as part of their family planning services" are barred from receiving funds from the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID).&lt;ref&gt;Laura Koran &amp; James Masters, [http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/politics/trump-mexico-city-policy/ Trump reverses abortion policy for aid to NGOs], CNN (January 24, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, Trump revoked the 2014 Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order then-President Barack Obama put in place to ensure that companies with federal contracts comply with 14 labor and civil rights laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-pulls-back-obama-era-protections-women-workers-n741041|title=Trump pulls back Obama-era protections for women in the workplace|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Trump spoke at the [[March for Life (Washington, D.C.)|March for Life]] in Washington D.C., becoming the first president to directly address the annual [[anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]] rally, albeit through satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=David|title=Trump hails anti-abortion measures in March for Life speech|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/19/trump-hails-his-conscience-protections-plan-in-speech-at-march-for-life|accessdate=January 20, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
Trump, a self-described [[Presbyterian]] who was described by [[CNN]] as "unique among modern American presidents for his seeming lack of deep religious orientation", has largely considered the support of [[Evangelical]] voters to be instrumental in him becoming President of the United States,&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=MJ|title=God and the Don|url=http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2017/politics/state/donald-trump-religion/|accessdate=October 7, 2017|work=State|agency=CNN|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 81% of whom voted for him.&lt;ref name="Worthen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Worthen|first1=Molly|title=A Match Made in Heaven|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/05/a-match-made-in-heaven/521409/|accessdate=October 7, 2017|work=The Atlantic|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump attended [[Marble Collegiate Church]], a congregation of the [[Reformed Church in America]], for more than 50 years but is not an "active member."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/nyregion/donald-trump-marble-collegiate-church-norman-vincent-peale.html|title=Overlooked Influences on Donald Trump: A Famous Minister and His Church|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[Melania Trump]] married at [[Bethesda-by-the-Sea|Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/new-the-palm-beach-church-where-trump-attended-easter-service/26I1Yi18vf08Tte6x0QSJI/|title=NEW: The Palm Beach church where Trump attended Easter service|work=palmbeachpost|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump has on several occasions suggested that [[Christianity in the United States|Christians]] are being discriminated against, for instance, stating that "Christianity is under tremendous siege."&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-christianity-merry-christmas-2016-1?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=TRUMP: If I'm president, 'Christianity will have power' in the US|website=Business Insider|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has vowed to end the [[Johnson Amendment]], an IRS rule that prohibits [[501(c) organization|section 501(c) tax-exempt organizations]] from endorsing candidates or participating in partisan campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy W.

In December 2015, in a speech accepting the endorsement of the New England Police Benevolent Association, Trump said that "One of the first things I do [if elected President] in terms of [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] if I win will be to sign a strong, strong statement that will go out to the country, out to the world, that ... anybody killing a police officer—death penalty.

==Drug policy==

Trump's views on [[drug policy]] have shifted dramatically over time.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Gray Brosious, [http://extract.suntimes.com/news/10/153/6390/dramatic-evolution-donald-trump-marijuana-drug-policy-reform-rhetoric The dramatic evolution of Donald Trump's drug policy rhetoric], ''Chicago Sun-Times'' (October 28, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

At a luncheon hosted by the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' in April 1990, Trump told a crowd of 700 people that U.S. drug enforcement policy was  "a joke," and that: "We're losing badly the [[war on drugs]]. You have to [[Legalization of drugs|legalize drugs]] to win that war. You have to take the profit away from these drug czars."&lt;ref name="SuebsaengDrugs"&gt;Asawin Suebsaeng, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/03/donald-trump-legalize-all-the-drugs.html Wayback Machine: Donald Trump: Legalize ALL the Drugs], ''Daily Beast'' (August 3, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19900414&amp;id=eUoeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EHoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4675,4533445&amp;hl=en Donald Trump: Legalize Drugs], ''Sarasota Herald-Tribune'' (April 14, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his campaign for the presidency in 2015 and 2016, however, Trump adopted "drug warrior" positions&lt;ref name="SuebsaengDrugs"/&gt; and has sought advice on the issue from [[William J. Bennett]], who served as the U.S. first "[[drug czar]]" in the 1980s "and has remained a proponent of harsh 1980s-style drug war tactics."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Ingraham, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/03/donald-trump-thinks-a-wall-will-solve-the-nations-heroin-problem/ Donald Trump's drug policy is an alarming throwback to the 1980s], ''Washington Post'' (March 3, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Trump told [[Sean Hannity]] in June 2015 that he opposes [[marijuana legalization]] and that "I feel strongly about that."&lt;ref name="SuebsaengDrugs"/&gt; Trump also claims to have personally never used [[controlled substance]]s of any kind.&lt;ref name="SuebsaengDrugs"/&gt;

Trump has voiced support for [[medical marijuana]],&lt;ref name="SuebsaengDrugs"/&gt; saying that he is "a hundred percent in favor" because "I know people that have serious problems... and... it really, really does help them."&lt;ref&gt;Jon Gettman, [http://www.hightimes.com/read/pot-matters-trump-marijuana Pot Matters: Trump on Marijuana], ''[[High Times]]'' (February 12, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about Colorado (where [[Drug policy of Colorado|recreational use of marijuana is legal]]), Trump softened his previously expressed views and essentially said that states should be able to decide on whether marijuana for recreational purposes should be legal.&lt;ref name="SuebsaengDrugs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnsonMarijuana"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/29/trump-wants-marijuana-legalization-decided-at-the-state-level/ |title=Trump softens position on marijuana legalization |author=Jenna Johnson|date=October 29, 2015|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Amendment and defamation law==
Trump has called for police to arrest those who protest at his rallies, saying that fear of an "arrest mark" that would "ruin the rest of their lives" would be a deterrent and that then "we're not going to have any more protesters, folks."&lt;ref&gt;Jenna Johnson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/03/12/donald-trump-demands-that-police-arrest-rally-protesters/ Donald Trump demands that police arrest rally protesters], Associated Press (March 12, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey R. Stone]], a professor at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], notes that opponents and disruptive individuals may be removed from Trump rallies consistent with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], but opponents have a First Amendment right to protest Trump ''outside'' the venue.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;[[Geoffrey R. Stone]], [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/geoffrey-r-stone/donald-trump-protest-and_b_9476498.html Donald Trump, Protest, and the First Amendment], ''Huffington Post'' (March 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Stone writes that it is unclear whether it would be consistent with the First Amendment for Trump to "order the removal of those who oppose his candidacy from his political rallies if he does not announce in advance that they are open only to his supporters," noting that the answer to this question depends not on the First Amendment, but on the nature of open invitations in the law of [[trespass]].&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt;

Trump has said that if elected, he would loosen [[defamation]] laws so that when journalists write "purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money." The [[Associated Press]] reported that this proposal to weaken the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protections for the press is at odds with "widely held conceptions of constitutional law." The [[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]] and other First Amendment advocates condemned Trump's proposal, which would make it easier to win lawsuits accusing newspapers of [[libel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trump-threatens-to-weaken-first-amendment-protections-for-reporters/ |title=Trump threatens to weaken First Amendment protections for reporters |agency=Associated Press |date=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump has expressed support for adopting [[English defamation law|English-style defamation laws]] in the U.S.; under UK law, it is easier for plaintiffs to sue newspapers and other media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Kludt, [http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/24/media/donald-trump-sue-news-organizations/ Donald Trump says he wants libel laws more like the UK's], CNN Money (October 24, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Callum Borchers, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/24/on-freedom-of-the-press-donald-trump-wants-to-make-america-like-england-again/ On freedom of the press, Donald Trump wants to make America like England again], ''Washington Post'' (October 24, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA)'s committee on media law created a report that was critical of Trump's support for expansive defamation laws and his use of libel suits in the past. The committee concluded that Trump was "a 'libel bully' who had filed many meritless suits attacking his opponents and had never won in court."&lt;ref name="LiptakDefamation"&gt;[[Adam Liptak]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/us/politics/donald-trump-lawsuits-american-bar-association.html?_r=0 Fearing Trump, Bar Association Stifles Report Calling Him a ‘Libel Bully’], ''New York Times'' (October 24, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The ABA's leadership blocked the report from being issued; the organization did not contest the committee's conclusions, but expressed concern about the possibility of being sued by Trump.&lt;ref name="LiptakDefamation"/&gt;

On the campaign trail in 2015 and 2016, Trump has frequently "railed against" the press, referring to the media as "the most dishonest people" and "absolute scum."&lt;ref name="DylanByersByers"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/16/media/politico-reporter-trump/index.html |title=Trump campaign blocks Politico reporter from victory rally |publisher=CNN Money|date=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trump campaign has barred reporters (from [[Politico]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', and [[Univision]], among others) from its campaign events, "often in the wake of critical coverage."&lt;ref name="DylanByersByers"/&gt; In October 2016, NBC News reportedly held off on airing a [[Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy|video of Trump making lewd and disparaging remarks about women]] due to concerns that Trump would sue the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/nbc-delayed-publication-of-lewd-trump-tape-because-of-lawsuit-fears/2016/10/08/a3c6850e-8db9-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html|title=NBC waited for green light from lawyers before airing Trump video|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=October 8, 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|accessdate=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender pay gap==
According to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Trump has not addressed the gender pay gap in his 2016 presidential bid (as of July 2016).&lt;ref name="equal-pay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-ivanka-trump-women-20160721-story.html|title=Ivanka Trump raises issues her father rarely mentions|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Tribune, "Trump's past statements on women in the workplace have included calling pregnancy 'an inconvenience' and telling a voter in New Hampshire last year that women will receive the same pay as men 'if they do as good a job.'"&lt;ref name="equal-pay" /&gt;

==LGBT issues==
[[Rea Carey]], the executive director of the [[National LGBTQ Task Force]], has described Trump's public statements on LGBT issues as "confusing and conflicting."&lt;ref name="Stack"&gt;Liam Stack, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/us/politics/trump-victory-alarms-gay-and-transgender-groups.html?_r=0 Trump Victory Alarms Gay and Transgender Groups], ''New York Times'' (November 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; During his campaign for the presidency, Trump did not emphasize the issue and at times gave ambiguous answers.&lt;ref name="HabermanGayIssues"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodruffSSM"&gt;Betsy Woodruff, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/11/trump-cruz-give-few-straight-answers-on-gay-marriage.html Trump, Cruz Give Few Straight Answers on Gay Marriage], ''Daily Beast'' (April 11, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Republican Party, Trump was viewed as having a more accepting view of LGBT people.&lt;ref name="HabermanGayIssues"&gt;Maggie Haberman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/us/politics/donald-trump-gay-rights.html Donald Trump's More Accepting Views on Gay Issues Set Him Apart in G.O.P.], ''New York Times'' (April 22, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Trump said that he was a supporter of "traditional marriage" but that the decision on whether to allow same-sex couples to marry should be determined state by state.&lt;ref name="EconomistSettled"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2016/11/president-elect-and-supreme-court Donald Trump says the law is settled on gay marriage but not on abortion], ''The Economist'' (November 17, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; At one point in the campaign, Trump said that "he would 'strongly consider' appointing Supreme Court justices who would overturn same-sex marriage." Later in the campaign, he held a [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow flag]] onstage in [[Greeley, Colorado]] to appeal to his gay supporters.&lt;ref name="Stack"/&gt; Soon after his election, Trump said that the law on same-sex marriage was settled "and I'm fine with that."&lt;ref name="EconomistSettled"/&gt;

===Before and during presidential candidacy===
====LGBT anti-discrimination laws====
In a February 2000 interview with ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', Trump said he supported amending the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] to include the category of [[sexual orientation]] and supported [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act|federal hate crime legislation that would cover sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=smMEAAAAMBAJ The Advocate]'' (February 15, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump has offered qualified support for the [[First Amendment Defense Act]], which aims to protect those who oppose [[same-sex marriage]] based on their religious beliefs from action by the federal government, such as revocation of tax-exempt status, grants, loans, benefits, or employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/17/how-conservatives-are-keeping-the-gay-marriage-issue-alive-on-capitol-hill/|title=How conservatives are keeping the gay marriage issue alive on Capitol Hill|website=Washington Post|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump said, "If Congress considers the First Amendment Defense Act a priority, then I will do all I can to make sure it comes to my desk for signatures and enactment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/12/23/trump-gives-conditional-support-for-religious-freedom-bill/|title=Trump gives conditional support for 'religious freedom' bill|date=December 23, 2015|website=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepulse2016.com/paul-dupont/2015/12/17/what-the-non-pledgers-said-in-support-of-fada/|title=What the Non-Pledgers Said in Support of FADA|date=December 17, 2015|website=The Pulse 2016|language=en-US|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, when asked about the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Indiana)|Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], Trump responded that Indiana Governor (and future running mate) [[Mike Pence]] "didn't do a good job. He wasn't clear in what he said." Trump then asserted that religious freedom and nondiscrimination aren't "mutually exclusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/kathie-obradovich/caucus/2015/04/08/trump-deal-deal/25500913/|title=Trump 2016: Deal or no deal?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Trump criticized North Carolina's [[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act|North Carolina House Bill 2]], which eliminates all private employment and public accommodation anti-discrimination laws not covered by statewide law, and legislates that in government buildings, individuals may only [[Bathroom bill|use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates]], saying: "North Carolina did something that was very strong and they're paying a big price. ... You leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go, they use the bathroom they feel is appropriate, there has been so little trouble, and the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife, and the economic punishment that they're taking."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Levine, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-north-carolina-bathroom-bill_us_5718ca1ee4b0c9244a7aec8c Donald Trump Thinks North Carolina Got It Wrong On Anti-LGBT Bathroom Bill], ''Huffington Post'' (April 21, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A.

====LGBT hate crime laws====
In a February 2000 interview with ''The Advocate'', Trump stated in response to the murder of [[Matthew Shepard]] and [[Murder of James Byrd Jr.|James Byrd]] that he wanted a more "tolerant society" and he would "absolutely" support [[Hate crime laws in the United States|hate crime legislation]] on the basis of their [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[ethnicity]], and [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=%252522Donald+Trump%252522+AND+%252522gay+rights%252522&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%252522Donald+Trump%252522+AND+%252522gay+rights%252522&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-RWWTeCDEuLeiAKun8WdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=%252522Donald%252520Trump%252522%252520AND%252520%252522gay%252520rights%252522&amp;f=false |title=The Advocate Interview February 2000 Donald Trump |publisher=Books.google.com |date=February 15, 2000 |accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LGBT military service====
In an October 1999 appearance on ''Meet the Press'', Trump said [[Don't ask, don't tell|gays openly serving in the military]] was "not something that would disturb me."&lt;ref name="Oct1999"/&gt; At a rally in October 2016, Candidate Trump called the open military service of transgender Americans a result of a "political correct military" and said that he would "very strongly" defer to the recommendations of top military officers on the issue of transgender military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Jenna Johnson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/03/heres-how-trump-responded-to-a-question-about-women-and-transgender-individuals-in-the-military/ Here's how Trump responded to a question about women and transgender individuals in the military], ''Washington Post'' (October 3, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Same-sex marriage====
In 2000, Trump stated "he believes that marriage is between a man and a woman."&lt;ref name="HabermanGayIssues"/&gt; During his 2016 campaign for the presidency, he said that he supported "traditional marriage"&lt;ref name="MEhren"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/22/heres-what-donald-trump-really-believes/ |title=Here's what Donald Trump really believes |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Max |last=Ehrenfreund |date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed  [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/03/22/trump-unlikely-to-undo-marriage-equality-before-supreme-court/ |title=Trump's far-fetched plan to undo marriage equality |work=[[Washington Blade]] |first=Chris |last=Johnson |date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, when asked about the ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' ruling, he said: "I would have preferred states, you know, making the decision and I let that be known. But they made the decision. ... So, at a certain point you have to be realistic about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/07/05/donald-trump-punching-back/ |title=Donald Trump punching back |work=MediaBuzz |publisher=Fox News Channel|date=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the run up to the Iowa caucuses on February 1, 2016, Trump stated that if elected he would strongly consider appointing Supreme Court justices that would overturn ''Obergefell''.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/01/31/ted-cruz-attacks-donald-trump-financial-record-trump-responds/|title=Ted Cruz attacks Donald Trump's financial record; Trump responds|date=January 31, 2016|publisher=Fox News|language=en-US|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-marriage-equality_us_56af63c8e4b00b033aafb496 |title=Trump: I Would 'Strongly Consider' Appointing Judges To Overturn Same-Sex Marriage |publisher=Huffington Post |date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if gay couples should be able access the same [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|benefits as married couples]], Trump said that his "attitude on it has not been fully formed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2011/03/03/register-exclusive-trump-says-he-would-play-in-iowa-aides-to-visit-monday|title=Trump says he would play in Iowa, aides to visit Monday|website=The Des Moines Register|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', an American [[LGBT]]-interest magazine, characterized Trump's Supreme Court picks as "LGBT-unfriendly," noting that "not all have ruled in LGBT rights cases, but those who have are largely unsympathetic, and some have the backing of anti-LGBT activists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/election/2016/5/18/trumps-lgbt-unfriendly-supreme-court-picks|title=Trump's LGBT-Unfriendly Supreme Court Picks|date=May 18, 2016|website=www.advocate.com|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, shortly after the presidential election, Trump told [[Lesley Stahl]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that his personal view on same-sex marriage was "irrelevant" and that he was "fine with" same-sex marriage, stating that the issue was "settled" in the ''Obergefell'' decision.&lt;ref name="EconomistSettled"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Stokols, [http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/donald-trump-same-sex-marriage-231310 Trump says he's 'fine' with legalization of same-sex marriage], ''Politico'' (November 13, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump is the first Republican presidential nominee to mention the LGBT community at a [[Republican National Convention]] acceptance speech,&lt;ref&gt;Meridith McGraw, [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-gop-nominee-mention-lgbtq-citizens-acceptance-speech/story?id=40791340 Trump Is First GOP Nominee to Mention LGBTQ Citizens in Acceptance Speech], ABC News (July 21, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; saying in his acceptance speech at the [[2016 Republican National Convention]]: "As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology"&amp;mdash;a reference to [[fundamentalist Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/card/trump-i-will-protect-our-lgbtq-citizens-n614621|title= Trump: "I Will Protect Our LGBTQ Citizens'|publisher=NBC News|date=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidency===
As a political candidate, Trump largely avoided issues related to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, even while many in his family — including daughter Ivanka Trump — have been vocal supporters of LGBT people. But since taking office, the Trump administration has rolled back a number of protections, including those for transgender schoolchildren.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/07/26/trump-announces-ban-on-transgender-people-in-u-s-military/|title=Trump announces ban on transgender people in U.S. military|last=|first=|last2=|date=|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-07-26|last3=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Danilova|first1=Maria|last2=Gurman|first2=Sadie|title=Trump administration revokes transgender bathroom guidance|website=[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|MassLive.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|url=https://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/02/trump_administration_revokes_t.html|date=February 22, 2017|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2017, Donald Trump and the White House stated that they would keep in place a 2014 executive order from the Obama administration which created federal workplace protections for LGBT people, with the White House  released a statement saying that the President was "respectful and supportive of LGBTQ rights" and noted that he was the first Republican nominee to raise the issue in his acceptance speech as the [[2016 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peters|first1=Jeremy W.|title=Obama's Protections for L.G.B.T.

In February 2017, Trump's Justice Department withdrew a motion that had previously been filed by the Justice Department, "seeking to allow transgender students in public schools to use the restroom with which they identify."  The move, which occurred within two days of [[Jeff Sessions]] becoming U.S. Attorney General, was condemned by the [[Human Rights Campaign]], an LGBT rights advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew V.

Also in February, the Trump administration kept U.S. diplomat [[Randy W.

On July 26, 2017, Trump announced on [[Twitter]] that [[transgender]] people would not be allowed to serve in the military "in any capacity", saying that American forces could not afford the "tremendous medical costs and disruption" of transgender service members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Julie Hirschfeld|title=Trump Says Transgender People Will Not Be Allowed in the Military|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/trump-transgender-military.html|accessdate=July 27, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a RAND study of 18 countries that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military found "little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/7/26/16034040/trump-transgender-military-study|title=Trump: allowing transgender military service would hurt combat readiness.

Also on July 26, the Department of Justice argued in court that federal civil rights law does not ban employers from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation.

The policy change faced legal challenges.  Following a challenge in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]], on October 30, 2017 Judge [[Colleen Kollar-Kotelly]] blocked enforcement of the ban, writing that as far as could be seen, ''"all of the reasons proffered by the president for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this case were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions and judgment of the military itself"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-transgender-20171030-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2017cv1597-61 Doe v Trump, 30 October 2017, District Court for Columbia, memorandum opinion]&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2018, Trump announced a new policy on transgender service members, namely a ban on those with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, which would effectively be a ban on most transgender service members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-announces-ban-on-most-transgender-service-members/|title=White House announces ban on most transgender service members|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new policy was challenged in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington|U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington]]. On April 13, 2018 Judge [[Marsha J.

==Privacy, encryption, and electronic surveillance==
{{See also|Mass surveillance in the United States|FBI–Apple encryption dispute}}
On [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) surveillance, Trump says that he "tends to err on the side of security" over privacy.

In February 2016, Trump urged his supporters to [[boycott]] [[Apple Inc.]] unless the company agrees to build a custom [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] for the FBI to unlock the password-protected [[iPhone]] connected to one of the perpetrators of the [[2015 San Bernardino shooting]], a move that Apple argues would threaten the security and privacy of its users.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Diamond, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/19/politics/donald-trump-apple-boycott/index.html Trump calls for Apple boycott], CNN (February 19, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Trump himself still uses his iPhone to send out tweets.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Fung, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/02/19/donald-trump-called-for-boycotting-apple-but-hes-still-tweeting-from-an-iphone/ Trump wants you to boycott Apple — but he's still tweeting from an iPhone], ''Washington Post'' (February 19, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race relations==
{{See also|Racial views of Donald Trump}}
Donald Trump is consistent in finding no fault on the part of law enforcement when it clashes with racial minorities and in dismissing contrary evidence.  In April 2017, Trump was accused of being Islamophobic while presenting [[Executive Order 13769]], which blocked people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2015, a week after the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], when asked if he would implement a database system to track [[Muslims in the United States]], Trump said: "I would certainly implement that. Absolutely. There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems." On November 21, Trump clarified that he doesn't support any registry of Muslims in the US and said that his earlier supportive remarks for surveilling Muslims were due to efforts by news media to entrap him. He however said that he would order "surveillance of certain mosques" to combat "[[Islamic extremism]]",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|author=Maggie Haberman|title=Donald Trump Calls for Surveillance of 'Certain Mosques' and a Syrian Refugee Database |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/us/politics/donald-trump-syrian-muslims-surveillance.html|newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC_Nov11_2015"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hillyard |first1=Vaughn |title=Trump's plan for a Muslim database draws comparison to Nazi Germany |url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-would-certainly-implement-muslim-database |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; alluding to the New York Police Department's use of informants in mosques after the [[September 11 attacks]].

==Rights of the accused==
In a 1989 interview with [[Larry King]], Trump stated: "The problem with our society is the victim has absolutely no rights and the criminal has unbelievable rights" and that "maybe hate is what we need if we're gonna get something done."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Kaczynski]] &amp; Jon Sarlin, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/trump-larry-king-central-park-five/ Trump in 1989 Central Park Five interview: "Maybe hate is what we need"], CNN (October 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Trump decried the fact that [[Ahmad Khan Rahami]], a U.S. citizen charged in connection with the [[2016 New York and New Jersey bombings|bombings in New York and New Jersey]], would be provided with medical treatment and the [[right to counsel]], calling this "sad."&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Taylor, [https://www.npr.org/2016/09/19/494633030/trump-calls-it-sad-that-n-y-bombing-suspect-gets-medical-care-lawyer Trump: 'Sad' N.Y.

At the second presidential debate, which took place in October 2016, Trump said that if he was "in charge of the law of our country," rival presidential contender [[Hillary Clinton]] would "be in jail."&lt;ref name="MorganMook"&gt;David Morgan, [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/clinton-campaign-manager-robby-mook-trump-thinks-u-s-is-banana-republic/ Clinton campaign manager likens Trump to a dictator], CBS News (October 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same debate, Trump also pledged that if elected, he would direct his attorney general to appoint a [[special prosecutor]] to "look into" Clinton.&lt;ref name="MorganMook"/&gt; Clinton campaign manager [[Robby Mook]] called the remark "chilling" and said: "Trump thinks that the presidency is like some [[banana republic]] dictatorship where you can lock up your political opponents."&lt;ref name="MorganMook"/&gt; The remark was viewed as part of "a litany of statements [Trump] has made during the campaign that many legal specialists have portrayed as a threat to the rule of law."&lt;ref name="SavageTinPot"&gt;Charlie Savage, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-special-prosecutor.html Threat to Jail Clinton Smacks of 'Tin-Pot Dictators,' Experts Say], ''New York Times'' (October 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The remark was condemned by a number of prominent Republican lawyers, such as [[Paul K. Charlton]], Marc Jimenez, and [[Peter Zeidenberg]],&lt;ref name="Gerstein"&gt;Josh Gerstein, [http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-clinton-jail-ex-prosecutors-slam-229547 GOP ex-prosecutors slam Trump over threat to 'jail' Clinton], ''Politico'' (October 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[David B. Rivkin]] and [[Michael Chertoff]].&lt;ref name="SavageTinPot"/&gt; Trump campaign manager [[Kellyanne Conway]] said that the "jail" comment was merely "a quip."&lt;ref name="Gerstein"/&gt;

Later that October, Trump spoke fondly of the "Lock her up" chants at his rally, saying "Lock her up is right."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-on-clinton-lock-her-up-is-right/2016/10/10/fd56d59e-8f51-11e6-bc00-1a9756d4111b_video.html|title=Trump on Clinton: 'Lock her up is right'|website=Washington Post|accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that Clinton's legal representatives "have to go to jail".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-lashes-out-polls-media-gop-229691|title=Trump turns bitter|newspaper=POLITICO|accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November, after winning the election, Trump told reporters from the ''[[New York Times]]'' that he would not recommend prosecution of Clinton, saying that it was "just not something (he) feel(s) very strongly about" and suggesting that Clinton had "suffered greatly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/22/politics/conway-no-clinton-charges-donald-trump/ |title=Trump flips, now opposes prosecution for Clinton |last=Wright |first=David  |last2=Wolf |first2=Z.

===Trying U.S. citizens in military tribunals===
In August 2016, Trump said that he "would be fine" with trying [[U.S. citizens]] accused of terrorism in [[military tribunal]]s at the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] at [[Guantánamo Bay]], Cuba.&lt;ref name="MazzeiGitmoUSCitizen"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Patricia Mazzei|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/donald-trump/article95144337.html|title=Trump: Americans could be tried in Guantánamo|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under current federal law (specifically, the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]]), trying U.S. citizens at military commissions is illegal; only "alien unlawful enemy combatants" may be tried in such commissions.&lt;ref name="MazzeiGitmoUSCitizen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quinta Jurecic, [https://www.lawfareblog.com/legality-donald-trumps-proposal-try-us-citizens-military-commission The Legality of Donald Trump's Proposal to Try US Citizens by Military Commission], ''Lawfare'' (August 12, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of torture to procure information===

In February 2016, Trump said that he approved of the use of [[waterboarding]] and "a hell of a lot worse."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; He said that "[[torture]] works" and called waterboarding   a "minor form" of torture.  Speaking with [[Sean Hannity]] on [[Fox News]] on January 26, 2017, Trump termed 
waterboarding "just short of torture," and said, "I will tell you, though, it works. And I just spoke to people who told me it worked, and that's what they do."  However, he said that he would rely on the advice of his defense secretary, [[James Mattis]] and others and, "If they don't wanna do, that's fine. If they do wanna do, then I will work for that end." &lt;ref name="Fact Check.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.factcheck.org/2017/01/trump-on-torture-again/ |title=Trump on Torture, Again |last=Schipani |first=Vanessa |date=January 27, 2017}}Trump discusses torture issue&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voter fraud, voter ID laws, and false claims about "rigged elections"==
Trump opposes same-day voter registration, supports voter identification laws, asserted that Obama won in 2012 due to voter fraud, has charged that the election system would be rigged against him in the 2016 race, and has equivocated on whether he would accept the outcome of the 2016 election.

Trump has asserted that America's "voting system is out of control," alleging that "you have people, in my opinion, that are voting many, many times," even though the number of cases of [[voter fraud]] in the U.S. is minuscule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jenna Johnson|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/05/trump-alleges-widespread-voter-fraud-this-voting-system-is-out-of-control/|title=Trump alleges widespread voter fraud: 'This voting system is out of control.'|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump opposes [[same-day voter registration]], alleging that this allows non-citizens to vote in U.S. elections and that voting laws should prevent people from "[sneaking] in through the cracks."&lt;ref name="CarrollVoting"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lauren Carroll|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-noncitizens-can-vote-whe/|title=Donald Trump wrongly says non-citizens can vote when there is same-day voter registration|website=PolitiFact|date=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PolitiFact ruled Trump's claim about voter fraud false, noting that according to experts, "there is no additional risk of noncitizens casting ballots in states with same-day voter registration, nor is there any evidence that this occurs."&lt;ref name="CarrollVoting"/&gt;

While he has repeatedly charged during his candidacy that the election system is rigged against him, Trump's statements became bolder and more specific in August 2016.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/08/12/trump-warns-of-electoral-cheating-during-pennsylvania-rally/|title=Trump Warns of Electoral 'Cheating' During Pennsylvania Rally|last=Routh|first=Julian|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He alleged that the only way he would only lose Pennsylvania if "cheating goes on", and that voters will cast their ballots "15 times" for Clinton without [[Voter ID laws in the United States|voter ID laws]].&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' notes that several voter ID laws have been struck down in several states recently, with courts ruling that they unfairly discriminate against minority voters, and that "there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud occurring in recent U.S. elections."&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; According to [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] political scientist [[Brendan Nyhan]], Trump's rhetoric "threatens the norms of American elections and could provoke a damaging reaction among his supporters."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/upshot/how-donald-trumps-rigged-claim-chips-away-at-democracy.html|title=How Donald Trump's 'Rigged' Claim Chips Away at Democracy|last=Nyhan|first=Brendan|date=August 5, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the September 2016 presidential debate, when asked if he would honor the outcome of the election, Trump said that he "absolutely" would.&lt;ref name=":76"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/trump-clinton-support-election-winner-debate-interview|title=Trump says he may not accept result if Clinton wins, in reversal from debate|last=Yuhas|first=Alan|date=September 30, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|accessdate=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":77"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-interview-bill-hillary-clinton.html|title=Donald Trump Opens New Line of Attack on Hillary Clinton: Her Marriage|last=Healy|first=Patrick|date=September 30, 2016|last2=Haberman|first2=Maggie|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, Trump appeared to have reconsidered his statement from the debate, saying "We're going to have to see. We're going to see what happens. We're going to have to see."&lt;ref name=":76" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":77" /&gt; In early- and mid-October 2016, Trump repeatedly claimed that the election was "rigged" and alleged that the media coordinated with the Clinton campaign, citing Alec Baldwin's [[Saturday Night Live cast members#President of the United States impressionists|portrayal]] of him on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name="SNL"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/10/16/donald-trump-twitter-hillary-clinton-rigged-election/92194034/|title=Trump bashes 'rigged' election (and Saturday Night Live)|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, after early voting and voting by mail had begun in many states, Trump claimed, without evidence, that ""The election is absolutely being rigged" at "many polling places."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-rigged-idUSKBN12G0SU|title=Trump says election being rigged 'at many polling places'|date=October 16, 2016|agency=Reuters|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SNL"/&gt; That same month, Trump asserted, also without evidence, that the federal government was allowing illegal immigrants to come into the U.S. so they can vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-immigrants-pouring-over-border-to-vote-229274|title=Trump says illegal immigrants pouring across the border to vote|newspaper=POLITICO|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''PolitiFact'' found Trump's claim of "large scale voter fraud" false, giving it a "Pants-on-fire" rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/17/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-large-scale-voter-f/|title=Trump's Pants on Fire claim of 'large scale voter fraud'|newspaper=@politifact|accessdate=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his election in November 2016&amp;mdash;in which he won the electoral college but received 2.8 million fewer votes nationally than Clinton&amp;mdash;Trump has repeatedly insisted, without evidence, that he actually won the popular vote if one excludes "3 to 5 million illegal votes" cast for his opponent.&lt;ref name="PhillipDeBonis"&gt;{{cite news|authors=Abby Phillip &amp; Mike DeBonis|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/at-white-house-trump-tells-congressional-leaders-3-5-million-illegal-ballots-cost-him-the-popular-vote/|title=Without evidence, Trump tells lawmakers 3 million to 5 million illegal ballots cost him the popular vote|date=January 23, 2017|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StokolsClaim"&gt;{{cite news|author=Eli Stokols|title=Trump brings up vote fraud again, this time in meeting with senators|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-voter-fraud-senators-meeting-234909|newspaper=Politico|date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael D.

In [[espionage]] and [[counterintelligence]], '''surveillance''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ər|ˈ|v|eɪ|.|ə|n|s}} or {{IPAc-en|s|ər|ˈ|v|eɪ|l|ə|n|s}})&lt;ref&gt;OED&lt;/ref&gt; is the monitoring of [[behavior]], activities, or other changing information for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting people.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, David. 2007. Surveillance Studies: An Overview. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) cameras)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/surveillance-cameras-and-crime |title=The effect of CCTV on public safety: Research roundup |authors=Leighton Walter Kille and Martin Maximino |date=11 February 2014 |work=Journalists Resource |publisher=Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center and the Carnegie-Knight Initiative |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as [[Internet traffic]] or phone calls). It can also include simple no- or relatively low-technology methods such as [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human intelligence agent]] and [[postal interception]]. The word ''[[Wikt:surveillance|surveillance]]'' comes from a [[French language|French]] phrase for "watching over" (''sur'' means "from above" and ''veiller'' means "to watch") and is in contrast to more recent developments such as [[sousveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eyetap.org/papers/docs/IEEE_ISTAS13_Sensularity_Minsky_etal.pdf Minsky M, Kurzweil R, Mann S (2013). "The Society of Intelligent Veillance", ''Proceedings of the IEEE ISTAS'' 2013, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, pp&amp;nbsp;13–17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, R. (1988). Information technology and dataveillance. Communications of the ACM, 31(5), 498–512.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2510&amp;context=infopapers Michael, K., Roussos, G., Huang, G. Q., Gadh, R., Chattopadhyay, A., Prabhu, S., &amp; Chu, P. (2010). "Planetary-scale RFID services in an age of uberveillance". ''Proceedings of the IEEE'', 98(9), 1663–1671]&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveillance is used by governments for intelligence gathering, prevention of crime, the protection of a process, person, group or object, or the investigation of crime. It is also used by criminal organisations to plan and commit crimes, such as robbery and kidnapping, by businesses to gather intelligence, and by [[private investigator]]s.

Surveillance can be viewed as a violation of [[privacy]], and as such is often opposed by various [[civil liberties]] groups and activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/oppose-video-surveillance-our-nations-capital |title=Oppose video surveillance in our nation's capital |publisher=ACLU. org |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rally.stopwatching.us/ |title=Stop watching us – A rally against mass surveillance |publisher=stopwatching.us |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberal democracy|Liberal democracies]] have laws which restrict domestic government and private use of surveillance, usually limiting it to circumstances where public safety is at risk. [[Authoritarian]] government seldom have any domestic restrictions, and international [[espionage]] is common among all types of countries.

The area of surveillance is increasingly a topic of academic study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868640254|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition)|last=Marx|first=Gary T.|date=2015|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080970875|editor-last=Wright|editor-first=James D.|location=Oxford|pages=733–741|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-097086-8.64025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; including through research centers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscqueens.org/|title=The Surveillance Studies Centre {{!}} A multi-disciplinary &amp; international research centre at Queen's University|website=www.sscqueens.org|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; books,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/145121196|title=Surveillance studies : an overview|last=1948–|first=Lyon, David,|date=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=9780745635927|oclc=145121196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-Surveillance-Studies/Petersen/p/book/9781466555099|title=Introduction to Surveillance Studies|website=CRC Press|language=en|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/883647071|title=Feminist surveillance studies|last=E.|first=Dubrofsky, Rachel|last2=Shoshana.|first2=Magnet,|isbn=9780822358923|oclc=883647071}}&lt;/ref&gt; and peer-reviewed academic journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society|title=Surveillance &amp; Society|website=ojs.library.queensu.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In the future, intelligence services might use the [[internet of things]] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials," Clapper said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US intelligence chief: we might use the internet of things to spy on you |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/09/internet-of-things-smart-home-devices-government-surveillance-james-clapper|website=Make a contribution News|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer===
[[File:IAO-logo.png|thumb|right|200px| Official seal of the [[Information Awareness Office]] – a U.S. agency which developed technologies for [[mass surveillance]]]]
{{Main |Computer surveillance}}

The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of [[data mining|data]] and [[traffic analysis|traffic]] on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="sciam-internet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=internet-eavesdropping|title=Internet Eavesdropping: A Brave New World of Wiretapping |last=Diffie|first=Whitfield|author2=Susan Landau |date=August 2008|work=Scientific American|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States for example, under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by federal law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="eff-calea-archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|title=CALEA Archive – Electronic Frontier Foundation|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503035053/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|archivedate=May 3, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/calea|title=CALEA: The Perils of Wiretapping the Internet|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq|title=CALEA: Frequently Asked Questions|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is far too much data on the Internet for human investigators to manually search through all of it. Therefore, automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic to identify and report to human investigators the traffic that is considered interesting or suspicious. This process is regulated by targeting certain "trigger" words or phrases, visiting certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or online chat with suspicious individuals or groups.&lt;ref name="usatoday-chatroom"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=October 11, 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billions of dollars per year are spent by agencies, such as the [[NSA]], the [[FBI]] and the now-defunct [[Information Awareness Office]], to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]], [[Narus (company)|NarusInsight]], and [[ECHELON]] to intercept and analyze all of this data to only extract the information which is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="zdnet-fbi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/fbi-turns-to-broad-new-wiretap-method/151059 |title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=January 30, 2007|work=ZDNet News|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computers can be a surveillance target because of the personal data stored on them. If someone is able to install software, such as the FBI's [[Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern]] and [[CIPAV]], on a computer system, they can easily gain unauthorized access to this data. Such software could be installed physically or remotely.&lt;ref name="teen-busted-in-wired"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2007/07/fbi_spyware |title = FBI's Secret Spyware Tracks Down Teen Who Made Bomb Threats |date = July 18, 2007 |publisher = Wired Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of computer surveillance, known as [[van Eck phreaking]], involves reading electromagnetic emanations from computing devices in order to extract data from them at distances of hundreds of meters.&lt;ref name="emr"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Van Eck, Wim | title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk? | journal=Computers &amp; Security | volume=4 | year=1985 | pages=269–286 | url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf | doi=10.1016/0167-4048(85)90046-X | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhn2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kuhn, M.G. | year = 2004 | title = Electromagnetic Eavesdropping Risks of Flat-Panel Displays | journal = 4th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies | pages = 23–25 | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/pet2004-fpd.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA runs a database known as "[[Pinwale]]", which stores and indexes large numbers of emails of both American citizens and foreigners.&lt;ref name="nytimes-email-surveillance"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/us/17nsa.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;hp|title=E-Mail Surveillance Renews Concerns in Congress |date=June 16, 2009 |work=New York Times|pages=A1|accessdate=June 30, 2009 | first1=James | last1=Risen | first2=Eric | last2=Lichtblau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic-pinwale"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/06/pinwale-and-the-new-nsa-revelations/19532/ |title=Pinwale And The New NSA Revelations|last=Ambinder|first=Marc|date=June 16, 2009|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the NSA runs a program known as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], which is a data mining system that gives the United States government direct access to information from technology companies. Through accessing this information, the government is able to obtain search history, emails, stored information, live chats, file transfers, and more. This program generated huge controversies in regards to surveillance and privacy, especially from U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/articles/2013-06-06-NSA-Prism-program-taps-in-to-user-data-of-Apple-Google-and-others-The-Guardian-Jun-06-2013.pdf|title=NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others|last=Greenwald; Ewen|first=Glen; MacAskill|date=June 6, 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet|title=Everything you need to know about PRISM|last1=Sottek|first1=T.C.|last2=Kopfstein|first2=Janus|date=July 17, 2013|work=The Verge|access-date=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephones===
{{Main|Phone surveillance|Lawful interception}}
The official and unofficial tapping of telephone lines is widespread. In the [[United States]] for instance, the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)]] requires that all telephone and VoIP communications be available for real-time wiretapping by Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="eff-calea-archive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-summary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-faq"/&gt; Two major telecommunications companies in the U.S.—[[AT&amp;T Inc.]] and [[Verizon]]—have contracts with the FBI, requiring them to keep their phone call records easily searchable and accessible for Federal agencies, in return for $1.8 million per year.&lt;ref name="threatlevel-exigent"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/09/rogue-fbi-lette.html#previouspost|title=Rogue FBI Letters Hint at Phone Companies' Own Data Mining Programs – Updated|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=September 10, 2007|work=Threat Level|publisher=Wired|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2005, the FBI sent out more than 140,000 "[[National Security Letter]]s" ordering phone companies to hand over information about their customers' calling and Internet histories. About half of these letters requested information on U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name="fbi-national-letters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aBd9Zzld22w0&amp;refer=home|title=Mueller Orders Audit of 56 FBI Offices for Secret Subpoenas |last=Roland|first=Neil|date=March 20, 2007|work=Bloomberg News|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human agents are not required to monitor most calls. [[Speech-to-text]] software creates machine-readable text from intercepted audio, which is then processed by automated call-analysis programs, such as those developed by agencies such as the [[Information Awareness Office]], or companies such as [[Verint]], and [[Narus (company)|Narus]], which search for certain words or phrases, to decide whether to dedicate a human agent to the call.&lt;ref name="latimes-fbi-intel-analysis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/29/nation/na-technology29|title=FBI Plans to Fight Terror With High-Tech Arsenal|last=Piller|first=Charles|author2=Eric Lichtblau |date=July 29, 2002|work=LA Times|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement and intelligence services in the United Kingdom and the United States possess technology to activate the microphones in cell phones remotely, by accessing phones' diagnostic or maintenance features in order to listen to conversations that take place near the person who holds the phone.&lt;ref name="schneier-roving-bugs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/remotely_eavesd_1.html|title=Remotely Eavesdropping on Cell Phone Microphones|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|date=December 5, 2006|work=Schneier On Security|accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roving-bugs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/FBI-taps-cell-phone-mic-as-eavesdropping-tool/2100-1029_3-6140191.html |title=FBI taps cell phone mic as eavesdropping tool |last=McCullagh |first=Declan |author2=Anne Broache |date=December 1, 2006 |work=CNet News |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110182623/http://news.cnet.com/FBI-taps-cell-phone-mic-as-eavesdropping-tool/2100-1029_3-6140191.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uk-mobile-bug"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/7166b8a2-02cb-11da-84e5-00000e2511c8.html|title=Use of mobile helped police keep tabs on suspect |last=Odell|first=Mark|date=August 1, 2005|work=Financial Times|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="noaa-phone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrc.noaa.gov/wrso/security_guide/telephon.htm|title=Telephones|year=2001|work=Western Regional Security Office (NOAA official site)|accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="can-you-hear-me"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/12/can_you_hear_me.html |title=Can You Hear Me Now? |work=ABC News: The Blotter |accessdate=December 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825102123/http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/12/can_you_hear_me.html |archivedate=August 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seattle-times-roving"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003474824_bugs130.html|title=Even if they're off, cellphones allow FBI to listen in|last=Coughlin|first=Kevin|date=December 13, 2006|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stingray phone tracker|StingRay]] tracker is an example of one of these tools used to monitor cell phone usage in the United States and the United Kingdom. Originally developed for counterterrorism purposes by the military, they work by broadcasting powerful signals that cause nearby cell phones to transmit their [[Mobile identification number|IMSI number]], just as they would to normal cell phone towers. Once the phone is connected to the device, there is no way for the user to know that they are being tracked. The operator of the stingray is able to extract information such as location, phone calls, and text messages, but it is widely believed that the capabilities of the StingRay extend much further.

Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data. The geographical location of a mobile phone (and thus the person carrying it) can be determined easily even when the phone is not being used, using a technique known as [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.&lt;ref name="bbc-phone-locate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4738219.stm|title=Tracking a suspect by mobile phone|date=August 3, 2005|work=BBC News|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews-phone-locate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,509211,00.html|title=Cell Phone Tracking Can Locate Terrorists – But Only Where It's Legal|last=Miller|first=Joshua|date=March 14, 2009|work=FOX News|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legality of such techniques has been questioned in the United States, in particular whether a court warrant is required.&lt;ref name="nyu-lawrev"&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1092293|title=Warrantless Location Tracking|year=2008|work=N.Y.U.

The Snowden leaks have also revealed that the British [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) can access information collected by the NSA on American citizens. Once the data has been collected, the GCHQ can hold on to it for up to two years.

===Cameras===
{{Main|Closed-circuit television}}
[[File:Cairns-Lagoon.JPG|thumb|right|A surveillance camera in [[Cairns, Queensland]]]]
[[File:Three Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Surveillance cameras such as these are installed by the millions in many countries, and are nowadays monitored by automated computer programs instead of humans.]]
Surveillance cameras are video cameras used for the purpose of observing an area. They are often connected to a recording device or [[IP network]], and may be watched by a [[security guard]] or [[law enforcement officer]]. Cameras and recording equipment used to be relatively expensive and required human personnel to monitor camera footage, but analysis of footage has been made easier by automated software that organizes digital video footage into a searchable [[database]], and by video analysis software (such as [[VIRAT]] and [[Human Identification at a Distance|HumanID]]). The amount of footage is also drastically reduced by motion sensors which only record when motion is detected. With cheaper production techniques, surveillance cameras are simple and inexpensive enough to be used in home security systems, and for everyday surveillance.

There are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia. The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years.&lt;ref name="SDM2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdmmag.com/articles/92407-rise-of-surveillance-camera-installed-base-slows|title=Rise of Surveillance Camera Installed Base Slows|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=5 January 2017|publishersdm magazine=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, China was reported to have a huge surveillance network of over 170 million CCTV cameras with 400 million new cameras expected to be installed in the next three years, many of which use [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-43751276|title=Smart cameras catch man in 60,000 crowd|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[Department of Homeland Security]] awards billions of dollars per year in [[Homeland Security grants]] for local, state, and federal agencies to install modern video surveillance equipment. For example, the city of [[Chicago]], Illinois, recently used a $5.1 million Homeland Security grant to install an additional 250 surveillance cameras, and connect them to a centralized monitoring center, along with its preexisting network of over 2000 cameras, in a program known as [[Operation Virtual Shield]]. Speaking in 2009, Chicago Mayor [[Richard M. Daley|Richard Daley]] announced that Chicago would have a surveillance camera on every street corner by the year 2016.&lt;ref name="sun-times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/1440402,|title=Surveillance cams help fight crime, city says|last=Spielman|first=Fran|date=February 19, 2009|work=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="were-watching"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/05/five_years/main1968121.shtml|title=We're Watching: How Chicago Authorities Keep An Eye On The City|last=Schorn|first=Daniel|date=September 6, 2006|work=CBS News|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of video surveillance cameras are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses. According to 2011 [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] requests, the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around 52,000 over the entirety of the UK.&lt;ref name=BBW2012&gt;{{cite web|title=The Price of Privacy: How local authorities spent £515m on CCTV in four years|url=http://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/files/priceofprivacy/Price_of_privacy_2012.pdf|publisher=Big Brother Watch|accessdate=4 February 2015|date=February 2012|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of video surveillance in the UK is often overstated due to unreliable estimates being requoted;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/factcheck+how+many+cctv+cameras/2291167|title=FactCheck: how many CCTV cameras?|publisher=Channel 4 News|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian2011&gt;{{cite news|title=You're being watched: there's one CCTV camera for every 32 people in UK – Research shows 1.85m machines across Britain, most of them indoors and privately operated|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/02/cctv-cameras-watching-surveillance|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 2011|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=In the press: How the media is reporting the 1.85 million cameras story|url=http://www.securitynewsdesk.com/in-the-press-how-the-media-is-reporting-the-1-85-million-cameras-story/|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=Security News Desk|date=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example one report in 2002 extrapolated from a very small sample to estimate the number of cameras in the UK at 4.2 million (of which 500,000 in [[London|Greater London]]{{refn|group=Note|Furthermore, the figure of 500,000 for Greater London is often confused with the figure for the local government and police operated cameras in the [[City of London]], which was about 650 in 2011.&lt;ref name=BBW2012 /&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbaneye.net/results/ue_wp6.pdf|title=CCTV in London|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More reliable estimates put the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom at around 1.85 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctvusergroup.com/art.php?art=94|title=How many cameras are there?|publisher=CCTV User Group|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023191646/http://www.cctvusergroup.com/art.php?art=94|archive-date=October 23, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, one example city where there are cameras is The Hague. There, cameras are placed in city districts in which the most illegal activity is concentrated. Examples are the [[red-light district]]s and the train stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/relocation-and-settling/to/Camera-surveillance.htm|title=Camera surveillance|first=Den|last=Haag|date=|publisher=|accessdate=December 2, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008030841/http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/relocation-and-settling/to/Camera-surveillance.htm|archivedate=October 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of China's [[Golden Shield Project]], several U.S. corporations, including [[IBM]], [[General Electric]], and [[Honeywell]], have been working closely with the [[Politics of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] to install millions of surveillance cameras throughout [[People's Republic of China|China]], along with advanced [[video analytics]] and facial recognition software, which will identify and track individuals everywhere they go. They will be connected to a centralized database and monitoring station, which will, upon completion of the project, contain a picture of the face of every person in China: over 1.3 billion people.&lt;ref name="rollingstone-china"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/20797485/chinas_allseeing_eye/print|title=China's All-Seeing Eye|last=Klein|first=Naomi|date=May 29, 2008|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lin Jiang Huai, the head of China's "Information Security Technology" office (which is in charge of the project), credits the surveillance systems in the United States and the U.K. as the inspiration for what he is doing with the Golden Shield Project.&lt;ref name="rollingstone-china"/&gt;

[[File:DSTAMP Controp Camera.jpg|thumb|left|A payload surveillance camera manufactured by Controp and distributed to the U.S. government by ADI Technologies]]
The [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) is funding a research project called [[Combat Zones That See]] that will link up cameras across a city to a centralized monitoring station, identify and track individuals and vehicles as they move through the city, and report "suspicious" activity (such as waving arms, looking side-to-side, standing in a group, etc.).&lt;ref name="wired-cts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-brother-to-see-all-everywhere/ |title=Big Brother To See All, Everywhere |date=July 1, 2003|agency=Associated Press|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Washington, D.C. had 5,000 "traffic" cameras installed under this premise, and then after they were all in place, networked them all together and then granted access to the Metropolitan Police Department, so they could perform "day-to-day monitoring".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trapwire-everything-you-need-to-know-2012-8|title=WIKILEAKS: Surveillance Cameras Around The Country Are Being Used In A Huge Spy Network|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of centralized networks of CCTV cameras watching public areas – linked to computer databases of people's pictures and identity ([[biometric]] data), able to track people's movements throughout the city, and identify whom they have been with – has been argued by some to present a risk to [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref name="epic-video-page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/surveillance/|title=EPIC Video Surveillance Information Page|work=EPIC|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trapwire]] is an example of such a network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sarah |last=Hedgecock |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/14/trapwire-the-less-than-advertised-system-to-spy-on-americans.html |title=TrapWire: The Less-Than-Advertised System To Spy On Americans |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social network analysis===
[[File:Kencf0618FacebookNetwork.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of the relationships between users on the [[social networking]] site [[Facebook]]. [[Social network analysis]] enables governments to gather detailed information about peoples' friends, family, and other contacts. Since much of this information is voluntarily made public by the users themselves, it is often consider to be a form of [[open-source intelligence]]]]
One common form of surveillance is to create maps of [[Social network analysis|social networks]] based on data from [[social networking sites]] such as [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[Twitter]] as well as from [[traffic analysis]] information from phone call records such as those in the [[NSA call database]],&lt;ref name="keefe"&gt;{{cite news|title= Can Network Theory Thwart Terrorists?|last=Keefe|first=Patrick |date=March 12, 2006|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

Jason Ethier of Northeastern University, in his study of modern social network analysis, said the following of the Scalable Social Network Analysis Program developed by the [[Information Awareness Office]]:

{{quote|The purpose of the SSNA algorithms program is to extend techniques of social network analysis to assist with distinguishing potential terrorist cells from legitimate groups of people....

AT&amp;T developed a programming language called "Hancock", which is able to sift through enormous databases of phone call and Internet traffic records, such as the [[NSA call database]], and extract "communities of interest"—groups of people who call each other regularly, or groups that regularly visit certain sites on the Internet.

Some people believe that the use of social networking sites is a form of "participatory surveillance", where users of these sites are essentially performing surveillance on themselves, putting detailed personal information on public websites where it can be viewed by corporations and governments.&lt;ref name="part-surv"/&gt; In 2008, about 20% of employers reported using social networking sites to collect personal data on prospective or current employees.&lt;ref name="havenstein"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9114560|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923065244/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9114560|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 23, 2008|title=One in five employers uses social networks in hiring process|last=Havenstein|first=Heather|date=September 12, 2008|work=Computer World|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biometric===
[[File:US-VISIT (CBP).jpg|thumb|right|Fingerprints being scanned as part of the [[US-VISIT]] program]]
{{Main|Biometrics}}

Biometric surveillance is a technology that measures and analyzes human physical and/or behavioral characteristics for authentication, identification, or screening purposes.&lt;ref name="rand-facial"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=John|author2=Christopher Horn |author3=Julius Gatune |author4=Aryn Thomas |title=Biometrics: A Look at Facial Recognition |publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2003|isbn=0-8330-3302-6|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA414520 |accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of physical characteristics include fingerprints, DNA, and facial patterns. Examples of mostly behavioral characteristics include gait (a person's manner of walking) or voice.

[[Facial recognition system|Facial recognition]] is the use of the unique configuration of a person's facial features to accurately identify them, usually from surveillance video.

Another form of behavioral biometrics, based on [[affective computing]], involves computers recognizing a person's emotional state based on an analysis of their facial expressions, how fast they are talking, the tone and pitch of their voice, their posture, and other behavioral traits. This might be used for instance to see if a person's behavior is suspect (looking around furtively, "tense" or "angry" facial expressions, waving arms, etc.).&lt;ref name="pop-mech-cameras"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/4236865.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219164859/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/4236865.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-12-19|title=Surveillance Society: New High-Tech Cameras Are Watching You|last=Vlahos|first=James|date=January 2008|work=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MicroAirVehicle.jpg|thumb|right|Micro Air Vehicle with attached surveillance camera]]

Aerial surveillance is the gathering of surveillance, usually visual imagery or video, from an airborne vehicle—such as an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], [[helicopter]], or [[surveillance aircraft|spy plane]]. Military [[surveillance aircraft]] use a range of sensors (e.g. radar) to monitor the battlefield.

Digital imaging technology, miniaturized computers, and numerous other technological advances over the past decade have contributed to rapid advances in aerial surveillance hardware such as [[micro-aerial vehicles]], [[forward-looking infrared]], and high-resolution imagery capable of identifying objects at extremely long distances. For instance, the [[MQ-9 Reaper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.military.com/equipment/mq-9-reaper|title=MQ-9 Reaper|last=Boyd|first=Ryan|language=en|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a U.S. drone plane used for domestic operations by the [[Department of Homeland Security]], carries cameras that are capable of identifying an object the size of a milk carton from altitudes of 60,000 feet, and has [[forward-looking infrared]] devices that can detect the heat from a human body at distances of up to 60 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/the-rapid-rise-of-federal-surveillance-drones-over-america/473136/|title=The Rapid Rise of Federal Surveillance Drones Over America|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier instance of commercial aerial surveillance, the [[Killington Mountain]] ski resort hired 'eye in the sky' aerial photography of its competitors' parking lots to judge the success of its marketing initiatives as it developed starting in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Bruce, [http://www.vermonttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/RH/20121109/BUSINESS03/711099916 "Killington co-founder Sargent dead at 83"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904091030/http://www.vermonttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2FRH%2F20121109%2FBUSINESS03%2F711099916 |date=September 4, 2015 }}, Rutland ''Herald'', November 9, 2012.

The [[United States]] [[Department of Homeland Security]] is in the process of testing UAVs to patrol the skies over the United States for the purposes of [[critical infrastructure protection]], border patrol, "[[Intelligent transportation system|transit monitoring]]", and general surveillance of the U.S. population.&lt;ref name="drones-us-skies"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-11746_3-6055658.html|title=Drone aircraft may prowl U.S. skies|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=March 29, 2006|work=CNet News|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miami-Dade police department ran tests with a vertical take-off and landing UAV from [[Honeywell]], which is planned to be used in [[SWAT]] operations.&lt;ref name="police-uavs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/12/06/220084/us-police-experiment-with-insitu-honeywell-uavs.html|title=US police experiment with Insitu, Honeywell UAVs |last=Warwick|first=Graham|date=June 12, 2007|work=FlightGlobal.com|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston's police department has been testing fixed-wing UAVs for use in "traffic control".&lt;ref name="police-uavs"/&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]], as well, is working on plans to build up a fleet of surveillance UAVs ranging from [[micro-aerial vehicles]] to full-size [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], to be used by police forces throughout the U.K.&lt;ref name="uk-uav-fleet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/07/17/215507/uk-home-office-plans-national-police-uav-fleet.html|title=UK Home Office plans national police UAV fleet |last=La Franchi|first=Peter|date=July 17, 2007|work=Flight International|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their surveillance capabilities, MAVs are capable of carrying [[taser]]s for "[[crowd control]]", or weapons for killing enemy combatants.&lt;ref name="uav-tazers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.policeone.com/police-products/less-lethal/articles/99337-No-Longer-Science-Fiction-Less-Than-Lethal-Directed-Energy-Weapons/|title=No Longer Science Fiction: Less Than Lethal &amp; Directed Energy Weapons|date=February 22, 2005|work=International Online Defense Magazine|accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs such as the [[Heterogeneous Aerial Reconnaissance Team]] program developed by [[DARPA]] have automated much of the aerial surveillance process. They have developed systems consisting of large teams drone planes that pilot themselves, automatically decide who is "suspicious" and how to go about monitoring them, coordinate their activities with other drones nearby, and notify human operators if something suspicious is occurring. This greatly increases the amount of area that can be continuously monitored, while reducing the number of human operators required. Thus a swarm of automated, self-directing drones can automatically patrol a city and track suspicious individuals, reporting their activities back to a centralized monitoring station.&lt;ref name="hart-overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/programs/hart/docs/HART_Overview.pdf|title=HART Overview|date=August 2008|work=IPTO (DARPA) – Official website|accessdate=March 15, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205233843/http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/programs/hart/docs/HART_Overview.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hart-proposal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicit/baa/BAA-04-05_PIP.pdf |title=BAA 04-05-PIP: Heterogeneous Airborne Reconnaissance Team (HART) |date=December 5, 2003 |work=Information Processing Technology Office (DARPA) – Official Website |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127074930/http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicit/baa/BAA-04-05_PIP.pdf |archivedate=November 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="defense-daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_40_236/ai_n29399227 |title=DARPA, Northrop Grumman Move Into Next Phase of UAV Control Architecture |last=Sirak |first=Michael |date=Nov 29, 2007 |work=Defense Daily |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309060941/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_40_236/ai_n29399227/ |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data mining and profiling===
[[Data mining]] is the application of statistical techniques and programmatic algorithms to discover previously unnoticed relationships within the data. [[Data profiling]] in this context is the process of assembling information about a particular individual or group in order to generate a profile&amp;nbsp;— that is, a picture of their patterns and behavior. Data profiling can be an extremely powerful tool for psychological and [[social network analysis]]. A skilled analyst can discover facts about a person that they might not even be consciously aware of themselves.&lt;ref name="profiling-euro"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Mireille Hildebrandt|last=Hildebrandt|first=Mireille|author2=Serge Gutwirth |title=Profiling the European Citizen: Cross Disciplinary Perspectives|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4020-6913-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic (such as credit card purchases) and social (such as telephone calls and emails) transactions in modern society create large amounts of stored [[data]] and records. In the past, this data was documented in paper records, leaving a "[[paper trail]]", or was simply not documented at all. Correlation of paper-based records was a laborious process—it required human intelligence operators to manually dig through documents, which was time-consuming and incomplete, at best.

But today many of these records are electronic, resulting in an "[[Digital footprint|electronic trail]]". Every use of a bank machine, payment by credit card, use of a phone card, call from home, checked out library book, rented video, or otherwise complete recorded transaction generates an electronic record. Public records—such as birth, court, tax and other records—are increasily being digitized and made available online. In addition, due to laws like [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]], web traffic and online purchases are also available for profiling. Electronic record-keeping makes data easily collectable, storable, and accessible—so that high-volume, efficient aggregation and analysis is possible at significantly lower costs.

Information relating to many of these individual transactions is often easily available because it is generally not guarded in isolation, since the information, such as the title of a movie a person has rented, might not seem sensitive. However, when many such transactions are [[government databases|aggregated]] they can be used to assemble a detailed profile revealing the actions, habits, beliefs, locations frequented, [[social network analysis|social connections]], and preferences of the individual. This profile is then used, by programs such as [[ADVISE]]&lt;ref name="data-sweep"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0209/p01s02-uspo.html|title=US Plans Massive Data Sweep|last=Clayton|first=Mark|date=February 9, 2006|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TALON (database)|TALON]], to determine whether the person is a military, criminal, or political threat.

In addition to its own aggregation and profiling tools, the government is able to access information from third parties&amp;nbsp;— for example, banks, credit companies or employers, etc.&amp;nbsp;— by requesting access informally, by compelling access through the use of subpoenas or other procedures,&lt;ref name="cdt-fbi-subpoenas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030924cdt.shtml |title=Administrative Subpoenas for the FBI: A Grab for Unchecked Executive Power |last=Flint |first=Lara |date=September 24, 2003 |work=The Center For Democracy &amp; Technology (official site) |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308183232/http://cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030924cdt.shtml |archivedate=March 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by purchasing data from commercial data aggregators or data brokers. The United States has spent $370 million on its 43 planned [[fusion centers]], which are national network of surveillance centers that are located in over 30 states. The centers will collect and analyze vast amounts of data on U.S. citizens. It will get this data by consolidating personal information from sources such as state driver's licensing agencies, hospital records, criminal records, school records, credit bureaus, banks, etc. – and placing this information in a centralized database that can be accessed from all of the centers, as well as other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="epic-fusion-centers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/surveillance/spotlight/0607/default.html|title="National Network" of Fusion Centers Raises Specter of COINTELPRO|date=June 2007|work= EPIC Spotlight on Surveillance|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=425&amp;invol=435 United States v. Miller]'' (1976), data held by third parties is generally not subject to [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] warrant requirements.

===Corporate===
Corporate surveillance is the monitoring of a person or group's behavior by a corporation. The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of [[business intelligence]], which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. Although there is a common belief that monitoring can increase productivity, it can also create consequences such as increasing chances of deviant behavior and creating punishments that are not equitable to their actions. Additionally, monitoring can cause resistance and backlash because it insinuates an employer’s suspicion and lack of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Denise|date=2017|title="Toward a Sociology of Privacy"|url=|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=43(1)|pages=249-269|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Business Intelligence====
Data collected on individuals and groups can be sold to other corporations, so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose. It can be used for [[direct marketing]] purposes, such as targeted advertisements on Google and Yahoo. These ads are tailored to the individual user of the search engine by analyzing their search history and emails&lt;ref name="nytimes-onlineads"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/technology/01Privacy.html?_r=1|title=F.T.C. to Review Online Ads and Privacy|last=Story|first=Louise|date=November 1, 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (if they use free webmail services), which is kept in a database.&lt;ref name="surv-in-society"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestarphoenix.com/Technology/Surveillance+society/1322333/story.html|title=Surveillance in society|last=Butler|first=Don|date=February 24, 2009|work=The Star Phoenix|publisher=CanWest|accessdate=March 17, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, [[Google]], the world's most popular search engine, stores identifying information for each web search. An [[IP address]] and the search phrase used are stored in a database for up to 18 months.&lt;ref name="cnet-googlelogs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13739_3-10038963-46.html|title=Debunking Google's log anonymization propaganda|last=Soghoian|first=Chris|date=September 11, 2008|work=CNET News|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google also scans the content of emails of users of its Gmail webmail service, in order to create targeted advertising based on what people are talking about in their personal email correspondences.&lt;ref name="joshi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/every-move-you-make-google-will-be-watching-you/57071/on|title= Every move you make, Google will be watching you|last=Joshi|first=Priyanki|date=March 21, 2009|work=Business Standard|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google is, by far, the largest Internet advertising agency. Their revenue model is based on receiving payments from advertisers for each page-visit resulting from a visitor clicking on a Google [[AdWords]] ad, hosted either on a Google service or a third-party website. Millions of sites place Google's advertising banners and links on their websites, in order to share this profit from visitors who click on the ads. Each page containing Google advertisements adds, reads, and modifies [[HTTP cookie|"cookies"]] on each visitor's computer.&lt;ref name="google-adprivacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html|title=Advertising and Privacy|year=2009|work=Google (company page)|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cookies track the user across all of these sites, and gather information about their web surfing habits, keeping track of which sites they visit, and what they do when they are on these sites. This information, along with the information from their email accounts, and search engine histories, is stored by Google to use for building a profile of the user to deliver better-targeted advertising.&lt;ref name="joshi"/&gt;

====Intra-Corporate Surveillance====
According to the [[American Management Association]] and the ePolicy Institute that undertake an annual quantitative survey about electronic monitoring and surveillance with approximately 300 U.S. companies, "more than one fourth of employers have fired workers for misusing e-mail and nearly one third have fired employees for misusing the Internet".&lt;ref name="stacy"&gt;American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute (2008). [http://press.amanet.org/press-releases/177/2007-electronic-monitoring-surveillance-survey Electronic Monitoring and Surveillance 2007 Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801095437/http://press.amanet.org/press-releases/177/2007-electronic-monitoring-surveillance-survey/ |date=August 1, 2012 }}. Retrieved July 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 40% of the companies monitor e-mail traffic of their workers, and 66% of corporations monitor Internet connections. In addition, most companies use software to block non-work related websites such as sexual or pornographic sites, game sites, social networking sites, entertainment sites, shopping sites, and sport sites. The American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute also stress that companies "tracking content, keystrokes, and time spent at the keyboard ... store and review computer files ... monitor the blogosphere to see what is being written about the company, and ... monitor social networking sites".&lt;ref name="stacy"/&gt; Furthermore, about 30% of the companies had also fired employees for non-work related email and Internet usage such as "inappropriate or offensive language" and "viewing, downloading, or uploading inappropriate/offensive content".&lt;ref name="stacy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allmer, Thomas (2012). Towards a Critical Theory of Surveillance in Informational Capitalism. Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government Use of Corporate Surveillance Data====
The United States government often gains access to these databases, either by producing a warrant for it, or by simply asking. The [[Department of Homeland Security]] has openly stated that it uses data collected from consumer credit and direct marketing agencies—such as Google—for augmenting the profiles of individuals whom it is monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nation.time.com/2013/08/01/the-surveillance-society/|title=The Surveillance Society|last=Drehle|first=David Von|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and other intelligence agencies have formed an "information-sharing" partnership with over 34,000 corporations as part of their [[Infragard]] program.

The U.S. Federal government has gathered information from grocery store "discount card" programs, which track customers' shopping patterns and store them in databases, in order to look for "terrorists" by analyzing shoppers' buying patterns.&lt;ref name="fox-store-cards"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,59262,00.html|title=Store Customer Cards a Source for FBI?|last=Vlahos|first=Kelley|date=August 1, 2002|work=FOX News|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human operatives===
Organizations that have enemies who wish to gather information about the groups' members or activities face the issue of infiltration.&lt;ref name="fbi-anna"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2006/01/332735.shtml|title=Information on the Confidential Source in the Auburn Arrests|last=anonymous|date=Jan 26, 2006|work=Portland Indymedia|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pentagon-infiltration"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10454316|title=Is the Pentagon spying on Americans?|last=Myers|first=Lisa|date=December 14, 2005|work=NBC Nightly News|publisher=msnbc.com|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to operatives' infiltrating an organization, the surveilling party may exert pressure on certain members of the target organization to act as [[informants]] (i.e., to disclose the information they hold on the organization and its members).&lt;ref name="senate-hearing-informants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIId.htm|title=The Use of Informants in FBI Domestic Intelligence Investigations |work=Final Report: Book III, Supplementary Detailed Staff Reports on Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans |pages=225–270 |date=April 23, 1976 |publisher=U.S. Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2010/jun/15/secret-justice-criminal-informants-and-americas-underground-legal-system/ |title= Secret Justice: Criminal Informants and America's Underground Legal System {{!}} Prison Legal News |website= www.prisonlegalnews.org |access-date= 2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding operatives is very expensive, and for governments with wide-reaching electronic surveillance tools at their disposal the information recovered from operatives can often be obtained from less problematic forms of surveillance such as those mentioned above. Nevertheless, human infiltrators are still common today. For instance, in 2007 documents surfaced showing that the [[FBI]] was planning to field a total of 15,000 undercover agents and informants in response to an anti-terrorism directive sent out by George W. Bush in 2004 that ordered intelligence and law enforcement agencies to increase their [[HUMINT]] capabilities.&lt;ref name="fbi-informant-network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/07/fbi-proposes-bu.html|title=FBI Proposes Building Network of U.S. Informants|last=Ross|first=Brian|date=July 25, 2007|work=Blotter|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, 2007 the U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[John Michael McConnell|Michael McConnell]] authorized the [[National Applications Office|National Applications Office (NAO)]] of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] to allow local, state, and domestic Federal agencies to access imagery from [[military intelligence]] [[Reconnaissance satellite]]s and [[Reconnaissance aircraft]] sensors which can now be used to observe the activities of U.S. citizens. The satellites and aircraft sensors will be able to penetrate cloud cover, detect chemical traces, and identify objects in buildings and "underground bunkers", and will provide real-time video at much higher resolutions than the still-images produced by programs such as [[Google Earth]].&lt;ref name="ns-archive-domestic-sat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB229/index.htm|title=U.S. Reconnaissance Satellites: Domestic Targets|work=National Security Archive|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-domestic-sat"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118714764716998275 |title=U.S. to Expand Domestic Use Of Spy Satellites|last=Block|first=Robert|date=August 15, 2007|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-sat-program-approved"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122282336428992785?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Satellite-Surveillance Program to Begin Despite Privacy Concerns |last=Gorman|first=Siobhan|date=October 1, 2008|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dhs-nao-factsheet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1187188414685.shtm |title=Fact Sheet: National Applications Office |date=August 15, 2007 |work=Department of Homeland Security (official website) |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311151910/http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1187188414685.shtm |archivedate=March 11, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpost-sat"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/15/AR2007081502430_pf.html|title=Domestic Use of Spy Satellites To Widen|last=Warrick|first=Joby|date=August 16, 2007|work=Washington Post|pages=A01|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday-spysat"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-09-26-civilian-spying_x.htm|title=Spy imagery agency watching inside U.S.|last=Shrader|first=Katherine|date=September 26, 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification and credentials===
[[File:Social Security card.jpg|thumb|right|A card containing an identification number]]

One of the simplest forms of identification is the carrying of credentials. Some nations have an [[Identity document|identity card]] system to aid identification, whilst others are considering it but face public opposition. Other documents, such as [[passport]]s, driver's licenses, library cards, banking or credit cards are also used to verify identity.

If the form of the identity card is "machine-readable", usually using an encoded magnetic stripe or identification number (such as a [[Social Security number]]), it corroborates the subject's identifying data. In this case it may create an electronic trail when it is checked and scanned, which can be used in profiling, as mentioned above.

===RFID and geolocation devices===
[[File:RFID hand 1.jpg|thumb|right|Hand with planned insertion point for Verichip device]]

====RFID tagging====
[[Radio Frequency Identification]] (RFID) tagging is the use of very small electronic devices (called "RFID tags") which are applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. The tags can be read from several meters away. They are extremely inexpensive, costing a few cents per piece, so they can be inserted into many types of everyday products without significantly increasing the price, and can be used to track and identify these objects for a variety of purposes.

Some companies appear to be "tagging" their workers by incorporating RFID tags in employee ID badges. Workers in U.K. considered [[strike action]] in protest of having themselves tagged; they felt that it was [[dehumanisation|dehumanizing]] to have all of their movements tracked with RFID chips.&lt;ref name="rfid-strike-uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/print/6294|title=Two Stories Highlight the RFID Debate|date=July 19, 2005|work=RFID Journal|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=March 2012}} Some critics have expressed fears that people will soon be tracked and scanned everywhere they go.&lt;ref name="usatoday-verichip"/&gt;  On the other hand, RFID tags in newborn baby ID bracelets put on by hospitals have foiled kidnappings.&lt;ref name="rfid-strike-uk" /&gt;

[[File:Paypass chip front.png|thumb|upright|left|RFID chip pulled from new credit card]]
[[Verichip]] is an RFID device produced by a company called Applied Digital Solutions (ADS). Verichip is slightly larger than a grain of rice, and is injected under the skin. The injection reportedly feels similar to receiving a [[Injection (medicine)|shot]]. The chip is encased in glass, and stores a "VeriChip Subscriber Number" which the scanner uses to access their personal information, via the Internet, from Verichip Inc.'s database, the "Global VeriChip Subscriber Registry". Thousands of people have already had them inserted.&lt;ref name="usatoday-verichip"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2007-07-21-chips_N.htm|title=Microchips in humans spark privacy debate|last=Lewan|first=Todd|date=July 21, 2007|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, for example, 160 workers at the Attorney General's office were required to have the chip injected for identity verification and [[access control]] purposes.&lt;ref name="mex-pig-verichip"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/global-cio/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=23901004|title= RFID Chips Implanted In Mexican Law-Enforcement Workers|last=Gardener|first=W.

In a 2003 editorial, CNET News.com's chief political correspondent, Declan McCullagh, speculated that, soon, every object that is purchased, and perhaps ID cards, will have RFID devices in them, which would respond with information about people as they walk past scanners (what type of phone they have, what type of shoes they have on, which books they are carrying, what credit cards or membership cards they have, etc.). This information could be used for identification, tracking, or [[targeted marketing]]. {{as of|2012}}, this has largely not come to pass.&lt;ref name="mccullagh-rfid"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2010-1069-980325.html|title=RFID Tags: Big Brother in small packages|last=McCullagh |first=Declan|date=January 13, 2003|work=CNET News|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Positioning System====
[[File:ConstellationGPS.gif|thumb|right|Diagram of GPS satellites orbiting Earth]]

{{see also|GPS tracking}}

In the U.S., police have planted hidden [[Global positioning system|GPS]] tracking devices in people's vehicles to monitor their movements,&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, D., Micheal.

''Ethical Justice: Applied Issues for Criminal Justice Students and Professionals''. 1st ed.  Academic Press, 2013. p150. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2009, they were arguing in court that they have the right to do this.&lt;ref name="fbi-warrantless-gps"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/federal/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=215800542|title=Court Asked To Disallow Warrantless GPS Tracking |last=Claburn|first=Thomas|date=March 4, 2009| work=Information Week |accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several cities are running pilot projects to require parolees to wear GPS devices to track their movements when they get out of prison.&lt;ref name="verichip-legal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/05/columns/fl.hilden.chip/index.html|title=What legal questions are the new chip implants for humans likely to raise?| last=Hilden| first=Julie| work=CNN.com (FindLaw)| accessdate=March 17, 2009| date=April 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mobile phones====
Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect geolocation data. The geographical location of a mobile phone (and thus the person carrying it) can be determined easily (whether it is being used or not), using a technique known [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.&lt;ref name="bbc-phone-locate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews-phone-locate"/&gt; Dr. Victor Kappeler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kappeler|first=Victor|title=Forget the NSA: Police May be a Greater Threat to Privacy|url=http://www.plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/forget-nsa-police-may-be-greater-threat-privacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of Eastern Kentucky University indicates that police surveillance is a strong concern, stating the following statistics from 2013:
{{quote|Of the 321,545 law enforcement requests made to Verizon, 54,200 of these requests were for "content" or "location" information—not just cell phone numbers or IP addresses. Content information included the actual text of messages, emails and the wiretapping of voice or messaging content in real-time.}}
A comparatively new off-the-shelf surveillance device is an [[IMSI-catcher]], a [[Telephone tapping|telephone eavesdropping]] device used to intercept mobile phone traffic and track the movement of mobile phone users. Essentially a "fake" [[cell site|mobile tower]] acting between the target mobile phone and the service provider's real towers, it is considered a [[man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] (MITM) attack. IMSI-catchers are used in some countries by [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], but their use has raised significant civil liberty and privacy concerns and is strictly regulated in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | chapter=Section 100i – IMS I-Catcher | title=The German Code Of Criminal Procedure | url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stpo/german_code_of_criminal_procedure.pdf | pages=43–44 | year=2014 | access-date=November 27, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925164238/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stpo/german_code_of_criminal_procedure.pdf | archive-date=September 25, 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human microchips===
{{Main|Microchip implant (human)}}

A human microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit device or [[RFID]] transponder encased in [[silicate glass]] and implanted in the body of a human being.  A [[subdermal implant]] typically contains a unique ID number that can be linked to information contained in an external database, such as personal identification, medical history, medications, allergies, and contact information.

Several types of microchips have been developed in order to control and monitor certain types of people, such as criminals, political figures and spies,{{Clarify|date=February 2016}} a "killer" tracking chip patent was filed at the German Patent and Trademark Office (DPMA) around May 2009.

===Devices===
{{See also|United States v. Spy Factory, Inc.}}
[[Covert listening device]]s and video devices, or "bugs", are hidden electronic devices which are used to capture, record, and/or transmit data to a receiving party such as a law enforcement agency.

The U.S. has run numerous domestic intelligence operations, such as [[COINTELPRO]], which have bugged the homes, offices, and vehicles of thousands of U.S. citizens, usually [[political activists]], [[subversives]], and [[criminals]].&lt;ref name="wolf-cointelpro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/cointel.htm|title=COINTELPRO|last=Wolf|first=Paul|work=(online collection of historical documents)|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement and intelligence services in the U.K. and the United States possess technology to remotely activate the microphones in cell phones, by accessing the phone's diagnostic/maintenance features, in order to listen to conversations that take place nearby the person who holds the phone.&lt;ref name="roving-bugs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uk-mobile-bug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="noaa-phone"/&gt;

===Postal services===
As more people use faxes and e-mail the significance of surveilling the postal system is decreasing, in favor of Internet and telephone surveillance. But interception of post is still an available option for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, in certain circumstances.{{citation needed |date=May 2015}} This is not a common practice, however, and entities like the US Army require high levels of approval to conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r381_10.pdf |title=U.S. Army Intelligence Activities |accessdate=25 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808002021/http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r381_10.pdf |archivedate=August 8, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] have performed twelve separate mail-opening campaigns targeted towards U.S. citizens. In one of these programs, more than 215,000 communications were intercepted, opened, and photographed.&lt;ref name="senate-mail-opening"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs94th/94755_III.pdf |title=Domestic CIA and FBI Mail Opening Programs |work=Final Report: Book III, Supplementary Detailed Staff Reports on Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans |pages=559–678 |date=April 23, 1976 |publisher=U.S. Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities |accessdate=March 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505050256/http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs94th/94755_III.pdf |archivedate=May 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="political-repression"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Robert|title=[[Political Repression in Modern America]]|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|isbn=978-0-252-06964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stakeout===
{{Redirect|Stakeout}}
A '''stakeout''' is the coordinated surveillance of a location or person. Stakeouts are generally performed [[covert]]ly and for the purpose of gathering [[evidence]] related to [[criminal activity]]. The term derives from the practice by [[land surveyor]]s of using [[survey stakes]] to measure out an area before the main building project is commenced.

=== Wildlife ===
The management of wildlife populations often requires surveillance. This includes, for example surveillance of (1) [[Invasive species]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hauser|first=Cindy E.|last2=McCarthy|first2=Michael A.|date=2009-07-01|title=Streamlining 'search and destroy': cost-effective surveillance for invasive species management|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01323.x/abstract|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=12|issue=7|pages=683–692|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01323.x|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; location and abundance for more effective management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Nyrop|first2=Jan P.|last3=Ellner|first3=Stephen P.|date=2016-06-01|title=The economic benefit of time-varying surveillance effort for invasive species management|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12617/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=53|issue=3|pages=712–721|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12617|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) illegal fishers and poachers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fSl9o9lFvoEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=+surveillance+fisheries&amp;ots=iSl00OnmlW&amp;sig=vQgrephh5FBz97zuzVbuME6wQys&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=surveillance%20fisheries&amp;f=false|title=Recent Trends in Monitoring Control and Surveillance Systems for Capture Fisheries|last=Flewwelling|first=Peter|last2=Nations|first2=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org.|isbn=9789251048764|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Rong|last2=Ford|first2=Benjamin|last3=Tambe|first3=Milind|last4=Lemieux|first4=Andrew|date=2014-01-01|title=Adaptive Resource Allocation for Wildlife Protection Against Illegal Poachers|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2615731.2615805|journal=Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems|series=AAMAS '14|location=Richland, SC|publisher=International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems|pages=453–460|isbn=9781450327381}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce harvest and [[overexploitation]] of natural resources, (3) the population abundances of endangered species to decrease the risk of extinction, and (4) wildlife diseases that can damange crops, agriculture and natural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mörner|first=T.|last2=Obendorf|first2=D.

==Controversy==
[[File:Bansky one nation under cctv.jpg|thumb|right|Graffiti expressing concern about proliferation of video surveillance]]

===Support===

Supporters of surveillance systems believe that these tools can help protect society from [[terrorists]] and [[criminals]]. They argue that surveillance can reduce crime by three means: by deterrence, by observation, and by reconstruction. Surveillance can deter by increasing the chance of being caught, and by revealing the [[modus operandi]]. This requires a minimal level of [[invasive observation|invasiveness]].&lt;ref name ="Deviant Behaviour - Socially accepted observation of behaviour for security"&gt;[http://www.fp7-tactics.eu/files/documents/Deviant%20Behaviour-Socially%20accepted%20observation%20of%20behaviour%20for%20security.pdf Deviant Behaviour – Socially accepted observation of behaviour for security], Jeroen van Rest&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method on how surveillance can be used to fight criminal activity is by linking the information stream obtained from them to a recognition system (for instance, a camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system). This can for instance auto-recognize fugitives and direct police to their location.

A distinction here has to be made however on the type of surveillance employed. Some people that say support video surveillance in city streets may not support indiscriminate telephone taps and vice versa. Besides the types, the way in how this surveillance is done also matters a lot; i.e. indiscriminate telephone taps are supported by much fewer people than say telephone taps only done to people suspected of engaging in illegal activities.

Surveillance can also be used to give human operatives a tactical advantage through improved situational awareness, or through the use of automated processes, i.e. [[video analytics]]. Surveillance can help reconstruct an incident and prove guilt through the availability of footage for forensics experts. Surveillance can also influence subjective security if surveillance resources are visible or if the consequences of surveillance can be felt.

Some of the surveillance systems (such as the camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system mentioned above) can also have other uses besides countering criminal activity. For instance, it can help on retrieving runaway children, abducted or missing adults and mentally disabled people. 
Other supporters simply believe that there is nothing that can be done about the loss of privacy, and that people must become accustomed to having no privacy. As [[Sun Microsystems]] CEO [[Scott McNealy]] said: "You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it."&lt;ref name="sun-getoverit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1999/01/17538|title=Sun on Privacy: 'Get Over It'|last=Sprenger|first=Polly|date=January 26, 1999|work=Wired Magazine|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bw-getoverit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_14/b3623028.htm |title=Privacy |last=Baig |first=Edward |author2=Marcia Stepanek |author3=Neil Gross |date=April 5, 1999 |work=Business Week |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017102602/http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_14/b3623028.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common argument is: "[[nothing to hide argument|If you aren't doing something wrong then you don't have anything to fear]]." Which follows that if one is engaging in unlawful activities, in which case they do not have a legitimate justification for their privacy. However, if they are following the law the surveillance would not affect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Daniel J. Solove|Solove, Daniel]]|title='I've Got Nothing to Hide' and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy|journal=San Diego Law Review|year=2007|volume=44|page=745|ssrn=998565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===
[[File:UncleSamListensIn.jpg|thumb|upright|An elaborate [[Sgraffito|graffito]] in Columbus, Ohio, depicting state surveillance of [[telecommunications]] ]]

With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program and [[ADVISE]], technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of their subjects.&lt;ref name="us-surveillance-soc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/gen/index.html|title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society?|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and [[American Civil Liberties Union]], have expressed concern that by allowing continual increases in government surveillance of citizens we will end up in a [[mass surveillance]] society, with extremely limited, or non-existent political and/or personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as ''[[Hepting v. AT&amp;T]]''.&lt;ref name="us-surveillance-soc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigger-monster"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/aclu_report_bigger_monster_weaker_chains.pdf|title=Bigger Monster, Weaker Chains: The Growth of an American Surveillance Society|date=January 15, 2003|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics state that the claim made by supporters should be modified to read: "As long as we do what we're told, we have nothing to fear.".&lt;!-- [103] --&gt; For instance, a person who is part of a political group which opposes the policies of the national government, might not want the government to know their names and what they have been reading, so that the government cannot easily subvert their organization, arrest, or kill them.&lt;!-- [104] --&gt; Other critics state that while a person might not have anything to hide right now, the government might later implement policies that they do wish to oppose, and that opposition might then be impossible due to mass surveillance enabling the government to identify and remove political threats.&lt;!-- [103] --&gt;&lt;!-- [105] --&gt; Further, other critics point to the fact that most people ''do'' have things to hide.&lt;!-- [102] --&gt;&lt;!-- [104] --&gt; For example, if a person is looking for a new job, they might not want their current employer to know this.&lt;!-- [106] --&gt; Also if an employer wishes total privacy to watch over their own employee and secure their financial information it may become impossible, and they may not wish to hire those under surveillance. The most concern of detriment is securing the lives of those who live under total surveillance willingly, educating the public to those under peaceful watch while identifying terrorist and those who use the same surveillance systems and mechanisms in opposition to peace, against civilians, and to disclose lives removed from the laws of the land.

In addition, a significant risk of private data collection stems from the fact that this risk is too much unknown to be readily assessed today. Storage is cheap enough to have data stored forever, and the models using which it will be analyzed in a decade from now cannot reasonably be foreseen.&lt;ref name="privacy-hbarel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hbarel.com/index.php/against-the-collection-of-private|title=Against the collection of private data: The unknown risk factor|date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the Government of China took steps to oppose widespread surveillance by security-company cameras, webcams, and [[IP Camera]]s after tens-of-thousands were made accessible for internet viewing by IT company [[Qihoo]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2124158/chinese-tech-firm-told-stop-watching-us-after-footage-security&lt;/ref&gt;

====Totalitarianism====
[[File:Sur-veillance-trafficcam-glog.jpg|thumb|upright|A traffic camera atop a high pole oversees a road in the Canadian city of Toronto]]

Programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]] have led many groups to fear that society is moving towards a state of [[mass surveillance]] with severely limited personal, social, political freedoms, where dissenting individuals or groups will be strategically removed in [[COINTELPRO]]-like purges.&lt;ref name="us-surveillance-soc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigger-monster"/&gt;

Kate Martin, of the Center For National Security Studies said of the use of military spy satellites being used to monitor the activities of U.S. citizens: "They are laying the bricks one at a time for a police state."&lt;ref name="washpost-sat"/&gt;

Some point to the blurring of lines between public and private places, and the privatization of places traditionally seen as public (such as shopping malls and industrial parks) as illustrating the increasing legality of collecting personal information.&lt;ref name="Marx et al, 2007"&gt;Marx, G.

Retrieved November 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance techniques are not created equal; among the many [[biometric]] identification technologies, for instance, [[face recognition]] requires the least cooperation. Unlike automatic fingerprint reading, which requires an individual to press a finger against a machine, this technique is subtle and requires little to no consent.&lt;ref name="Agre, 2003" /&gt;

====Psychological/social effects====
{{See also|Hawthorne effect}}
Some critics, such as [[Michel Foucault]], believe that in addition to its obvious function of identifying and capturing individuals who are committing undesirable acts, surveillance also functions to create in everyone a feeling of always being watched, so that they become self-policing. This allows the State to control the populace without having to resort to physical force, which is expensive and otherwise problematic.&lt;ref name="foucault-discipline"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=1979|pages=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of panopticism is a means of indirect control over a large populace through the uncertainty of surveillance. Michel Foucault analyzed the architecture of the prison panopticon, and realized that its success was not just in its ability to monitor but also its ability to not monitor without anyone knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|pages=200–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Critics such as Derrick Jensen and George Draffan, argue that panopticism in the United States began in World War I when the issuing of passports became important for the tracking of citizens and possibly enemies of the state. Such surveillance continues today through government agencies in the form of tracking internet usage and library usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|title= Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance and the Culture of Control|date=2004|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=Vermont|pages=112–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of digital technology, individuals have become increasingly perceptible to one another, as surveillance becomes virtual. Online surveillance is the utilization of the internet to observe one's activity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Superconnected: the internet, digital media, and techno-social life|last=Chayko|first=Mary|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2017|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations, citizens, and governments participate in tracking others' behaviours for motivations that arise out of business relations, to curiosity, to legality. In her book ''Superconnected'', Chayko differentiates between two types of surveillance: vertical and horizontal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vertical surveillance occurs when there is a dominant force, such as the government that is attempting to control or regulate the actions of a given society. Such powerful authorities often justify their incursions as a means to protect society from threats of violence or terrorism. Some individuals question when this becomes an infringement on civil rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Horizontal diverges from vertical surveillance as the tracking shifts from an authoritative source to an everyday figure, such as a friend, coworker, or stranger that is interested in one's mundane activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Individuals leave traces of information when they are online that reveal their interests and desires of which others observe. While this can allow people to become interconnected and develop social connections online, it can also increase potential risk to harm, such as [[cyberbullying]] or censoring/stalking by strangers, reducing privacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Michel Foucault has expanded literature on discipline and power structures within society, specifically by developing Jeremy Bentham's notion of the [[panopticon]]. This metaphor has been used to illustrate the influence of surveillance on the individual, in addition to society as a collective. The panopticon is a circular prison design in which prison guards are located within the center of the facility, monitoring the prisoners who are invisible to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison|last=Foucault|first=Michel|publisher=Vintage|year=1977|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the inmates are not consistently observed, they are nevertheless obliged to abide by the rules due to the perception that they are under surveillance. This is similar to the contemporary prevalence of undercover police and highway trackers. An example of video surveillance is called closed-circuit television ([[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]), which are used to reduce crime and increase public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheldon|first=Barrie|date=October 2011|title=Camera surveillance within the UK: Enhancing public safety or a social threat?|url=|journal=International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology|volume=25|pages=193–203|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation is maintained both through vertical and self-surveillance.

====Privacy====
Numerous [[civil rights]] groups and [[privacy]] groups oppose surveillance as a violation of people's right to privacy. Such groups include: [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[American Civil Liberties Union]]

There have been several lawsuits such as [[Hepting v. AT&amp;T]] and [[EPIC v. Department of Justice]] by groups or individuals, opposing certain surveillance activities.

Legislative proceedings such as those that took place during the [[Church Committee]], which investigated domestic intelligence programs such as [[COINTELPRO]], have also weighed the pros and cons of surveillance.

;Court Cases

[[People v. Diaz|People vs. Diaz (2011)]] was a court case in the realm of cell phone privacy, even though the decision was later overturned. In this case, Gregory Diaz was arrested during a sting operation for attempting to sell ecstasy.  During his arrest, police searched Diaz's phone and found more incriminating evidence including SMS text messages and photographs depicting illicit activities.  During his trial, Diaz attempted to have the information from his cell phone removed from evidence, but the courts deemed it as lawful and Diaz's appeal was denied on the California State Court level and, later, the Supreme Court level.  Just three short years after, this decision was overturned in the case Riley vs. California (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1033744.html|title=People vs. Diaz|last=Court of Appeal, Second District, Division 6, California.|first=|date=July 30, 2008|website=FindLaw|access-date=Feb 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Riley v. California|Riley vs. California (2014)]] was an extremely vital [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] case in which a man was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting.  A few days after the shooting the police made an arrest of the suspect (Riley), and, during the arrest, the police searched him.  However, this search was not only of Riley's person, but also the police opened and searched his cell phone, finding pictures of other weapons, drugs, and of Riley showing gang signs.  In court, the question arose whether searching the phone was lawful or if the search was protected by the 4th amendment of the constitution.  The decision held that the search of Riley's cell phone during the arrest was illegal, and that it was protected by the 4th Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/13-132|title=Riley v.

==Countersurveillance, inverse surveillance, sousveillance==
[[Countersurveillance]] is the practice of avoiding surveillance or making surveillance difficult. Developments in the late twentieth century have caused counter surveillance to dramatically grow in both scope and complexity, such as the Internet, increasing prevalence of electronic [[security systems]], high-altitude (and possibly armed) [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]], and large corporate and government computer databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/secrets_countersurveillance|title=The Secrets of Countersurveillance|publisher=Security Weekly|date=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inverse surveillance]] is the practice of the reversal of surveillance on other individuals or groups (e.g., citizens photographing police). Well-known examples are [[Rodney King|George Holliday]]'s recording of the [[Rodney King]] beating and the organization [[Copwatch]], which attempts to monitor police officers to prevent [[police brutality]].  Counter-surveillance can be also used in applications to prevent corporate spying, or to track other criminals by certain criminal entities. It can also be used to deter stalking methods used by various entities and organizations.

''[[Sousveillance]]'' is inverse surveillance, involving the recording by private individuals, rather than government or corporate entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Popular culture==
===In literature===
* [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' portrays a fictional [[totalitarian]] surveillance society with a very simple (by today's standards) [[mass surveillance]] system consisting of human operatives, informants, and two-way "telescreens" in people's homes. Because of the impact of this book, mass-surveillance technologies are commonly called "Orwellian" when they are considered problematic.
* The novel ''[[mistrust]]'' highlights the negative effects from the overuse of surveillance at Reflection House. The central character Kerryn installs secret cameras to monitor her housemates – see also [[Paranoia]].
* The book ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', as well as a film based on it, portray a totalitarian [[Christian]] [[theocracy]] where all citizens are kept under constant surveillance.
* In the book ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', [[Lisbeth Salander]] uses computers to get information on people, as well as other common surveillance methods, as a freelancer.
* [[Dave Eggers|David Egger's]] novel ''[[The Circle (Eggers novel)|The Circle]]'' exhibits a world where a single company called "The Circle" produces all of the latest and highest quality technologies from computers and smartphones, to surveillance cameras known as "See-Change cameras". This company becomes associated with politics when starting a movement where politicians go "transparent" by wearing See-Change cameras on their body to prevent keeping secrets from the public about their daily work activity. In this society, it becomes mandatory to share personal information and experiences because it is The Circle's belief that everyone should have access to all information freely. However, as Eggers illustrates, this takes a toll on the individuals and creates a disruption of power between the governments and the private company. The Circle presents extreme ideologies surrounding mandatory surveillance. Eamon Bailey, one of the Wise Men, or founders of The Circle, believes that possessing the tools to access information about anything or anyone, should be a human right given to all of the world's citizens.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Circle|last=Eggers|first=David|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf, McSweeney's Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0-385-35139-3|location=New York|pages=288, 290–291, 486}}&lt;/ref&gt; By eliminating all secrets, any behaviour that has been deemed shameful will either become normalized or no longer considered shocking. Negative actions will eventually be eradicated from society altogether, through the fear of being exposed to other citizens&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would be achieved in part by everyone going transparent, something that Bailey highly supports, although it's notable that none of the Wise Men ever became transparent themselves. One major goal of The Circle is to have all of the world's information filtered through The Circle, a process they call "Completion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A single, private company would then have full access and control over all information and privacy of individuals and governments. Ty Gospodinov, the first founder of The Circle, has major concerns about the completion of the circle. He warns that this step would give The Circle too much power and control, and would quickly lead to [[totalitarianism]].

===In music===
* The [[Dead Kennedys]]' song "I Am The Owl" is about government surveillance and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] of political groups.
* The [[Vienna Teng]] song "Hymn of Acxiom" is about corporate data collection and surveillance.

===Onscreen===
{{Main|List of films featuring surveillance}}

* The film ''[[Gattaca]]'' portrays a society that uses [[biometric]] surveillance to distinguish between people who are genetically engineered "superior" humans and genetically natural "inferior" humans.
* In the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', the police and government intelligence agencies use [[micro aerial vehicles]] in [[SWAT]] operations and for surveillance purposes.
* [[HBO]]'s crime-drama series ''[[The Sopranos]]'' regularly portrays the FBI's surveillance of the [[DiMeo Crime Family]]. Audio devices they use include "[[Covert listening device|bugs]]" placed in strategic locations (e.g., in "[[I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano]]" and "[[Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood]]") and hidden microphones worn by operatives (e.g., in "[[Rat Pack (The Sopranos)|Rat Pack]]") and informants (e.g., in "[[Funhouse (The Sopranos)|Funhouse]]", "[[Proshai, Livushka]]" and "[[Members Only (The Sopranos)|Members Only]]"). Visual devices include [[hidden cameras|hidden still cameras]] (e.g., in "[[Pax Soprana]]") and video cameras (e.g., in "[[Long Term Parking]]").
* The movie ''[[THX-1138]]'' portrays a society wherein people are drugged with sedatives and antidepressants, and have surveillance cameras watching them everywhere they go.
* The movie ''[[The Lives of Others]]'' portrays the monitoring of [[East Berlin]] by agents of the [[Stasi]], the [[East Germany|GDR]]'s secret police.
* The movie ''[[The Conversation]]'' portrays many methods of [[Eavesdropping|audio surveillance]].

== History ==
Talkspace was founded in 2012 by Oren and Roni Frank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/12/technology/talkspace-series-a/index.html|title=Text therapy startup raises $9.5 million|last=O'Brien|first=Sara Ashley|date=2015-05-12|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to cofounding Talkspace, Roni Frank worked as a software developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2015/05/13/therapy-via-text-startup-raises-9-5-m-series-a.html|title=Talkspace raises $9.5M to let users text their therapists|last=Novellino|first=Teresa|date=May 13, 2015|website=New York Business Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was conceived after a transformative experience in couples therapy that saved their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/02/12/couples-therapy-yeah-theres-an-app-for-that-too/|title=Couples therapy — yeah, there’s an app for that too|date=2015-02-12|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of psychotherapy were so meaningful for Roni Frank that, wanting to share it with others, she chose to pursue a master’s degree in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/texting-your-therapist-and-other-anonymous-and-eas.html|title=Texting Your Therapist and Other Anonymous and Easy Ways to Get Help|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2017-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talkspace began as a group therapy platform, but has evolved to a company offering online psychotherapy from licensed therapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/adweeks-picks-for-the-years-best-digital-brands-and-content-from-talkspace-to-musical-ly/?|title=Adweek's Digital Hot List: 2017's Buzziest Apps, Gadgets, Startups and More|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talkspace introduced Unlimited Messaging Therapy in 2014, providing users unlimited text messaging with a therapist on the Talkspace website or mobile app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/12/talkspace/|title=Unlimited Messaging Therapy Startup Talkspace Raises $2.5M From Spark Capital And Softbank {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Lawler|first=Ryan|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clients and therapists can also send audio and video messages on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/29/talkspace-therapy-by-text-service-launches-asynchronous-audio-video-messaging/|title=Talkspace Therapy-By-Text Service Launches Asynchronous Audio, Video Messaging {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Crook|first=Jordan|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://themighty.com/2017/04/review-pros-cons-online-therapy-app-talkspace/|title=The Pros and Cons of Using Online Therapy App 'Talkspace'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the therapy platform was expanded to include [[Relationship counseling|couples therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/now-you-and-that-special-someone-can-get-couples-110901981384.html|title=Now You and That Special Someone Can Get Couples’ Therapy Straight Through Your iPhone|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 2015 Talkspace launched “Social Media Dependency Therapy,” a 12-week program that addresses mental health issues related to social media use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/social-media-dependency-now-has-12-week-therapy-plan-created-talkspace-encourages-2099788|title=Social Media Dependency Now Has A 12-Week Therapy Plan Created By Talkspace, Encourages People To #ReflectReality|date=2015-09-16|work=International Business Times|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2016, users and licensed therapists can use real-time voice and video calls during therapy sessions for its ''Unlimited Messaging Therapy''™ and ''LiveTalk Online Therapy''™ programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jlim/2016/08/26/agora-io-is-poised-to-dominate-real-time-voice-and-video-apps/#61b8ac0a28b8|title=Agora.io Is Poised To Dominate Real-Time Voice And Video Apps|last=Lim|first=Jason|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talkspace's ''Live Video'' programs are powered by Agora.io, a provider of HIPAA compliant video services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/talkspace-launches-livetalk-online-therapy-bringing-real-time-video-and-voice-calls-to-its-mobile-app-300302196.html|title=Talkspace Launches LiveTalk Online Therapy™, Bringing Real-Time Video And Voice Calls To Its Mobile App|last=Talkspace|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform works via unlimited texting where therapists respond once or twice per day, depending on the plan, and conversations are seamless across devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-use-talkspace-text-therapy-app-2015-3|title=I spent 7 amazing days with a therapist who only knew me via text message|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform uses banking-grade encryption to maintain client confidentiality and protect privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1064624-talkspace-showcases-e-therapy-app-at-flatiron-plaza/|title=Talkspace Showcases e-Therapy App at Flatiron Plaza|date=2014-11-05|work=The Epoch Times|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same privacy rules governing clients’ confidentiality and protection exist as in brick and mortar therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.domesticshelters.org/domestic-violence-articles-information/online-virtual-therapy-nbsp#.WTmNo9htmgQ|title=Online Virtual Therapy|work=DomesticShelters.org|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; All therapists are licensed and screening involves background-checks, technical training, and clinical interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/modern-therapy|title=Dawn of the Text-Message Therapist|website=Motherboard|language=en-us|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to brick and mortar therapy, clients work with their therapist in a structured environment to set goals and work through mental health and life challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.menshealth.co.uk/healthy/is-this-the-future-of-mental-health|title=Can your smartphone update your mental health|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goals are continually assessed and clients play an active role in their therapeutic journey by providing feedback to their therapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://healthegy.com/talkspace-wants-to-change-how-people-seek-and-see-therapy/|title=TalkSpace Wants to Change How People Seek – and See - Therapy - Healthegy|date=2016-10-02|work=Healthegy|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talkspace is a monthly subscriptions service with several tiered options for therapy and [[online counseling]], all of which are significantly less expensive than equivalent in-person therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opencounseling.com/blog/betterhelp-vs-talkspace-a-former-therapists-in-depth-review-part-1-33|title=BetterHelp vs TalkSpace: A Former Therapists' In-Depth Review (Part 1)|website=OpenCounseling|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talkspace is also [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] BAA compliant. It was audited to determine if the quality, design, and operating effectiveness of the controls put in place to meet the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and HITECH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.e-counseling.com/online-therapy/talkspace-review/|title=TalkSpace Review {{!}} Online Therapy Reviews {{!}} E-counseling.com|work=E-Counseling.com|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

==Reaction==
The reaction to Talkspace has been positive including users stating that, "Our text and video conversations were much-needed mental-health pit stops—a convenient, constructive alternative to Valium."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-anti-anxiety-app-1495542095|title=The Anti-Anxiety App|last=Caldwell|first=Jessica|date=2017-05-23|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another user has stated that, “I’m feeling my anxiety start to settle down in a way that it hasn’t in years — probably since I was last in therapy. I’m also feeling a new sense of hope about my life, and that the things that were festering inside of me — the worries that were starting to creep into all aspects of my life again — are finally going to be addressed again.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.babble.com/body-mind/how-online-therapy-works-helps-anxiety/|title=My Anxiety Had Reached an All-Time High, Until Online Therapy Saved Me|date=2017-05-23|work=Babble|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2016 Election ==
In addition to reporting on a nationwide uptick in demand for psychotherapy, Talkspace saw requests for therapy appointments triple in the wake of the 2016 election, with increases seen across demographic groups, but were particularly high for minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/20/health/post-election-stress-partner/index.html|title='Post-election stress disorder' strikes on both sides|last=News|first=Jenny Gold, Kaiser Health|website=CNN|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study conducted in partnership with HealthMap researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital, a quarter of Talkspace users polled reported feeling “very stressed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-09/inside-the-daily-american-panic-attack|title=In the Therapist’s Office, Trump Becomes a Hot Topic|date=2017-02-09|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dream and Lie of Franco''''' is a series of two sheets of prints, comprising 18 individual images, and an accompanying [[prose poem]], by [[Pablo Picasso]] produced in 1937. The sheets each contain nine images arranged in a 3x3 grid. The first 14, in [[etching]] and [[aquatint]], are dated  8 January 1937. The remaining four images were added to the second [[printing plate]] later, without use of aquatint, and dated June 7, 1937.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]: [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1986.1224.1%5B2%5D Dream and Lie of Franco, 1937]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NGV&gt;[[National Gallery of Victoria]]: [http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/picasso/education/ed_JTE_ITG.html An Introduction to Guernica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]: [https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/guernica_nav/gnav_level_1/1bcause_guerfrm.html Picasso's commitment to the cause]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Dream and Lie of Franco'' is significant as Picasso's first overtly [[The arts and politics|political work]] and prefigures his iconic political painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''. The etchings [[satire|satirise]] Spanish [[Generalísimo]] [[Francisco Franco]]'s claim to represent and defend conservative Spanish culture and values by showing him in various ridiculous guises destroying Spain and its culture while the poem denounces "evil-omened polyps".&lt;ref&gt;Michigan Today: [http://www.umich.edu/~newsinfo/MT/02/Sum02/mt13j02.html Picasso's War]&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the four images added in June 1937 are directly related to studies for ''Guernica''.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;

The individual images were originally intended to be published as [[postcard]]s to raise funds for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican government]], and sold at the Spanish Pavilion of the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 World's Fair]], although it is unclear whether any prints were made or sold in postcard format.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

In his review of the etchings for ''[[The Spectator]]'' in October 1937, art historian (and member of the [[Cambridge Five]] spy-ring) [[Anthony Blunt]] complained that the work could not "reach more than the limited coterie of [[Aestheticism|aesthetes]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steiner |first=George |title=George Steiner: a reader| chapter=The Cleric of Treason|page=179 | year=1987 |isbn=0195050681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic and author John Golding on the other hand, claimed that "more than any other work by Picasso ''Dream and Lie of Franco'' breaks down, as the [[Surrealists]] so passionately longed to, distinctions between thought, writing and visual imagery."&lt;ref name="Golding 1994 244"&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Golding| title=Visions Of the Modern| year=1994 |page=244| isbn=0520087925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Images==
The images form a sequence like those in a [[comic book]] and have a loose narrative:&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NGV/&gt;
Franco's form changes from panel to panel. The Spanish dictator's appearance has been likened by various writers to a "[[jackboot]]ed [[phallus]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Brian |first=Patrick |title=Picasso: A Biography | year=2012 |page=318|isbn=0007466382}}&lt;/ref&gt; "an evil-omened [[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]]"&lt;ref name="Golding 1994 244"/&gt; and "a grotesque [[homunculus]] with a head like a gesticulating and tuberous [[sweet potato]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van Hensbergen |first=Gijs |title=Guernica: The Biography of a Twentieth-Century Icon | page=28 | year=2013 |isbn=1408841487}} Quote by Joaquín de la Puente&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Third World socialism''' was a variant of [[socialism]] proponed by [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Modibo Keïta]], [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Julius Nyerere]], [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]], [[Michel Aflaq]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], [[Juan Perón]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Sukarno]], [[David Ben-Gurion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/transcript.html#2_5|title=Heaven on Earth. The Film: Transcript - Revolutions: The Kibbutz|accessdate=5 March 2018}} "The first two Prime Ministers [Ben-Gurion and [[Moshe Sharett]]] were kibbutz members". The Kibbutz were [[Labour Zionism|labour]] [[Zionist]] [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] [[comunes]] with a direct democracy system as such influenced by social democracy and [[fabian socialism]], just like all the other Third World socialists.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], [[Buddhadasa]], [[Walter Lini]] and other such socialist leaders of the [[Third World]] who saw a non-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] version of socialism as the answer to a strong and developed nation. It could be argued that the new "turn to the left" leadership in Latin America (see [[socialism of the 21st century]]), with its anti-Americanism, connection with less developed Eastern Europe, sense of undeveloped countries/developing countries unity and pro-Arabism/pro-Islamism, is a new kind of Third World socialism. It may be described as an ideologically specific form of [[Third-Worldism]] and it is made up of [[African socialism]], [[Arab socialism]], [[Nasserism]], [[Peronism]], [[Nehruism]], [[Labor Zionism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/transcript.html#2_6|title=Heaven on Earth. The Film: Transcript - Revolutions: Julius Nyerere &amp; Third World Socialism|accessdate=5 March 2018}} "Much was unique about the Jewish state. But in choosing socialism as its strategy for development, Israel was part of a swelling tide. For the nations reaching for independence in the aftermath of World War II, state planning was held out as the quickest path to prosperity".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic socialism]],&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Although Gaddafi's version was more inspired in the ideas of [[direct democracy]], [[arab nationalism]], [[Strongman (politics)|strongman politics]] and [[national liberation struggle]] while Bhutto's was more western-aligned and resembled, allied and inspired itself in the ideas of Western [[democratic socialism]]/[[social democracy]] and as such had membership in the [[Socialist International]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhist socialism]] and [[Melanesian socialism]].

== African socialism ==
The leaders of [[African socialism]] were Julius Nyerere, first president of Tanzania after the independence, who coined the concept of [[Ujamaa]] and collectivized the land, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], first president of Ghana, who was one of the fathers of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], praised state planning policies like Five-Year Plans and an agency for the regulation of cocoa exports; and in several political speeches and writings developed his theory of an "African socialism", [[Modibo Keita]], father of Mali; and [[Ahmed Sekou Touré]], father of Guinea.

== Arab socialism ==
The main figures of [[Arab socialism]] are [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], first president of Egypt, who [[Suez Crisis#Nationalisation of the Suez Canal and the road to crisis|nationalized the Suez Canal]], and the [[Ba'ath Party]], founded in Syria by [[Michel Aflaq]], which gained popularity in the whole Arab world and reached the government in Syria (until present) and Iraq (until 2003).

== Middle Eastern socialism ==
[[Iran]] experienced a short Third World socialism period at the zenith of the [[Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh Party]] after the abdication of [[Reza Shah]] and his replacement by his son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] (though the party never rose to power). After failing to reach power, this form of third world socialism was replaced by [[Mohammad Mosaddegh|Mosaddegh]]'s populist, non-aligned [[Iranian nationalism]] of the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] party as the main anti-[[monarchy]] force in Iran, reaching power (1949–1953), and it remained with that strength even in opposition (after the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|overthrowning of Mossadegh]]) until the rise of [[Islamism]] and the [[Iranian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Dabashi2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2267/is_2_67/ai_63787340/pg_20|title=The End of Islamic Ideology - Iran|work=Social Research|year=2000|author=Hamid Dabashi|accessdate=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tudehs have moved towards basic socialist [[communism]] since then.&lt;ref name="Omidvar2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tudehpartyiran.org/history.htm|title=Brief History of the Tudeh Party of Iran|author=Mehdi Omidvar|accessdate=6 March 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828044952/http://www.tudehpartyiran.org/history.htm|archivedate=28 August 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kemalism]] can very arguably be added to the list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=GaoQUb9hLR8C|page=80}}|title=Alevi identity|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=hA89q99T2-sC|page=14}}|title=Nostalgia for the modern|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it happeared before the notion of Third World was created in post-[[World War II]], it added populism to the equation (something not all Third World socialists did; Nasser and Nkrumah, for example, did) and [[Turkey]] is more developed than the typical notion of a Third World country, but as it was used as a model of government after the [[Turkish War of Independence]] to rebuild Turkey and recover it from the underdevelopment of the [[Ottoman Empire]], creating a strong nation in face of the prospect of [[European colonialism]], it can be considered as reaching the templates of a Third World socialism movement. From the 1960s onwards, Third World socialist and Third Worldist thought influenced left-Kemalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=Ghah5S3usnsC|page=425}}|title=A Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co|year=1978|isbn=0870739425|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=322|editor=Norman W. Provizer}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fabian Society|Fabian socialism]] (and [[social democracy]] in general)&lt;ref name="heaven2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/resources/hoe_prologue.txt|title=Changing Faiths - From the Prologue of Heaven on Earth|accessdate=5 March 2018}} "This was a hybrid of communism and [[social democracy]], exemplified by [[Julius Nyerere]]'s Tanzania, and modeled partly after Chinese Maoism, partly after [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Fabianism]]".&lt;/ref&gt; and the main Third World communist regime, the [[People's Republic of China]],&lt;ref name="heaven2"/&gt; were big influences on the movement. Despite being inspired by social democracy, most of this regimes were affected in one time or the other by strongmen or [[Big man (political science)|big man]] leaders or [[one-party system]]s. In any case, most Third World socialist regimes are followers of social democratic [[reformism]] (normally state-guided), preferring it to [[Revolutionary socialism|revolution]], though some adopted a kind of [[permanent revolution]] stance on the social progress to a socialist society.

== Latin American socialism ==
Many [[Pink tide|Latin American thinkers]] argued that the United States used Latin American countries as "peripheral economies" at the expense of Latin American social and economic development, which many saw as an extension of [[Neocolonialism|neo-colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|neo-imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dependency and development in Latin America|last=Enzo Faletto Verné and Fernando Henrique Cardoso|publisher=University of California Press|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift in thinking led to a surge of dialogue related to how Latin America could assert its social and economic independence from the United States. Many scholars argued that a shift to socialism could help liberate Latin America from this conflict.

The [[New Left]] emerged in Latin America, a group which sought to go beyond existing [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] efforts at achieving economic equality and democracy to include social reform and address issues unique to Latin America such as racial and ethnic equality, indigenous rights and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|jstor=j.ctt183q5k5|title=The New Latin American Left: Utopia Reborn|last=Patrick Barrett, Daniel Chavez, César Rodríguez-Garavito|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable New Left movements in Latin America include the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959, the victory of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] revolution in Nicaragua of 1979, the [[:es:Partido de los Trabajadores (Brasil)|Partido de los Trabajadores]] (Worker's Party) government in Porto Alegre of 1990, among others.

Because of its close proximity and strong [[Cuba–United States relations|historical connection]] to the [[United States]], [[Cuba]] served an integral role in [[Pink tide|spreading]] [[socialism]] to the rest of [[Latin America]].  [[Che Guevara]] described Cuba as "a guiding light" to Latin American countries caught in conflict between [[imperialism]] and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Che Guevara|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1967/che-reader/che-reader.pdf|title=Tactics and Strategy of the Latin American Revolution|date=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Guevara's speech "On Revolutionary Medicine", he recounts his travels through Latin America and the misery, hunger and disease he witnessed and explained how a shift to socialism could help alleviate these struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1960/08/19.htm|title=On Revolutionary Medicine|author=Che Guevara|date=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[New Left]], [[Fidel Castro]] and Che Guevara implemented leftist politics in Cuba while incorporating policies aimed at addressing social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|jstor=j.ctt183q5k5|title=The New Latin American Left: Utopia Reborn|last=Patrick Barrett, Daniel Chavez, César Rodríguez-Garavito|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2008|pages=1–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/china/che.pdf|title=Guerrilla Warfare: A Method, Cuba Socialista|author=Che Guevara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban officials intended for Cuba to spur similar leftist revolutions in the rest of Latin America, what he saw as a common "liberation struggle", in countries like [[Movement for Socialism (Venezuela)|Venezuela]], [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Bolivia]] and [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxist.com/cuba-spread-revolution-latin-america.htm|title=Cuba: the only way out is to spread the revolution throughout Latin America|work=El Militante|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/giap/1961-pwpa.pdf|title=People's War, People's Army|author=Che Guevara|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[Juan Perón]], elected president of Argentina on three times, the Third World socialist stance was a more radical variation of [[populism]] which aligned itself with the Third World and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (what Perón called "the [[Third Position]]"), with a significant [[statism|state intervention]] for development, such as [[Five-Year Plans of Argentina|five-year plans]], the [[Railway nationalization in Argentina|nationalization of railways]], ports and banks, the creation of an agency to regulate [[grain]] exports (the [[Five-Year Plans of Argentina#The IAPI|IAPI]]) and the establishment of a modern [[welfare state]]. Despite his [[Progressivism|progressive]] policies, Perón did not define himself or his doctrine as "socialist" during his first presidencies (1946–1952 and 1952–1955), but he did later during his exile and during his third presidency (1973–1974) when he coined the term "national socialism", sort of an Argentine way to socialism, which he described as a social democracy mainly modeled after the "[[Nordic model|Swedish model]]" and also inspired by other Non-Aligned, Third World socialist models such as [[Nasser]], [[Christian socialism]] and the [[corporatism|corporatist]] policies of European 1920s, 1930s and 1940s fascism.&lt;ref name="peronism"&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=AsuoVCbF7DgC|page=10}}|title=Peronism and Argentina|pages=9–12|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vice President of Taiwan''' , officially the '''Vice President of the Republic of China'''({{zh|t=中華民國副總統|p=Zhōnghuá Mínguó Fù Zǒngtǒng}}), is the second-highest executive official of Taiwan. Since 1996, the President and the Vice President are elected together by direct plurality voting to a four-year term. [[Chen Chien-jen]] is the current Vice President of the [[Republic of China]].

Originally established in [[Nanking]], the ROC government , along with its presidency, relocated to Taiwan after losing the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949.

==Powers==
Under Article 49 the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], in case the office of the President should become vacant, the Vice President shall succeed until the expiration of the original presidential term. In case the office of both the President and the Vice President should become vacant, the [[President of the Executive Yuan]] shall act for the President. In case the President should be unable to attend to office due to any cause, the Vice President shall act for the President. In case both the President and the Vice President should be unable to attend to office, the President of the Executive Yuan shall act for the President. After the Vice President succeeds as president, the office of Vice President remains vacant for the remainder of the term.

Aside from succeeding the president in the case of death, resignation, or impeachment of the president, and acting as president in the event the president becomes incapacitated, the vice president holds little formal power in the government.

Until 1996, the vice president was elected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]]. Beginning in the [[ROC presidential election, 1996|1996 election]], the vice president has been elected through a direct popular vote of citizens with [[household registration]] in the "[[Free Area of the Republic of China]]" on the same ticket as the president.

==Precedents==
Two vice presidents have succeeded to the president upon the death of the president. [[Yen Chia-kan]] became president in 1975 upon the death of President [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Lee Teng-hui]] became president in 1988 upon the death of President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]. Yen stepped down as president three years later in favor of Chiang Ching-kuo

Another, [[Li Tsung-jen]], formally acted as president from 21 January 1949 to 1 March 1950. President Chiang Kai-shek had resigned amid heavy losses during the [[Chinese Civil War]], but was unclear on whether he was resigning permanently, or simply wished to step down temporarily. Chiang remained as Director-General of the [[Kuomintang]] and continued to give orders to the army as if he were in control. Amid this power struggle, Li left for medical treatment in the United States in November 1949 following the fall of the temporary capital of [[Chongqing]] to capital forces where he was accepted as a foreign head of state. Chiang retreated to [[Chengdu]] and finally moved the government to Taiwan in December 1949, acting as the de facto leader until formally "resuming" his duties in the next March. Li would nominally remain as vice president ''in absentia'' until 1954 until being impeached by the [[Control Yuan]] for "failure to carry out duties due to illegal conduct."

Due to the relative lack of formal power of the position, it has been coupled in the past with the office of the [[premier of the Republic of China]]. Vice presidents [[Chen Cheng]], [[Yen Chia-kan]], and [[Lien Chan]] all served as premier concurrently as vice president during part of their terms, and vice president [[Annette Lu]] has at times been mentioned as a possible candidate for premiership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12435">In the [[Philippines]], votes are counted electronically since 2010. Starting with the [[Philippine general election, 2010|2010 general elections]] voters have to shade an oval preceding the candidate's name on their [[paper ballot]], and have their ballot registered with an [[Optical mark recognition]] (OMR) machine. While the machine prints a voting receipt, it collects the vote count electronically to be eventually transmitted to the [[Municipal Board of Canvassers]].

Following massive problems with the machines in the 2010 and 2013 elections, the Philippine [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] leased 94,000 new OMR machines from London-based company [[Smartmatic]], while the old ones would be refurbished for the 2019 elections. The deployment of 92,509 vote counting machines constituted the largest of its kind worldwide, as other countries using technology to automate voting, such as [[Brazil]] and [[India]] employ [[electronic voting]] systems instead of digitizing of voter-marked ballots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Smartmatic: PH now world reference point for automated elections |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/785083/smartmatic-ph-now-world-reference-point-for-automated-elections |date=May 11, 2016 |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of voting machines in general elections==

{{see also|Philippine general election, 2010}}
The [[Philippines]] began using technology to streamline vote counting in 2010. The introduction of semi-automatic ballot-counting technology used in the [[Philippine general election, 2010|general election]] however suffered from a number of technical and procedural problems. Civil society group [[Center for People Empowerment in Governance|CenPEG]] and minor party [[All Filipino Democratic Movement]] (KAAKBAY), amongst others, questioned the constitutionality of the election and its safety against [[electoral fraud]] or cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CenPEG |title=Foreign Observers Challenge Election Legitimacy |url=http://www.cenpeg.org/2010/may/FOREIGN_OBSERVERS_CHALLENGE_ELECTION_LEGITIMACY.html |year=2010 |accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kaakbay Party-List |title=Critique of the May 2010 automated polls |newspaper=[[The Daily Tribune]] |url=http://www.tribuneonline.org/commentary/20100610com6.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613165452/http://www.tribuneonline.org/commentary/20100610com6.html |date=6 October 2010 |archive-date=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippine general election, 2013===
{{see also|Philippine general election, 2013}}
In spite of the problems experienced with counting machines in 2010, the same technology was used in the subsequent [[Philippine general election, 2013|2013 mid-term election]] where approximately 760 million votes were cast by some 50 million voters. This time, a quarter of all machines experienced problems in transmitting the results. According to poll watchdog [[AES Watch]], up to 8.6 million votes had been affected, or possibly disenfranchised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquirer.net/philippine-election-2013/articles/414059 |title=18,000 PCOS machines suffered transmission woes, says poll chief |last1=Santos |first1=Matikas |date=May 23, 2013 |website=Inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; significantly contributing to AES Watch's assessment of the 2013 elections being "a technology and political disaster,"&lt;ref name=disaster&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/309045/news/nation/poll-watchdog-calls-2013-elections-a-technology-and-political-disaster |title=Poll watchdog calls 2013 elections a 'technology and political disaster' |last1=Dinglasan |first1=Rouchelle D. |date=May 18, 2013 |website=GMA News Online |publisher=GMA News and Current Affairs |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fueling speculations of "vote rigging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/416755/comelec-failed-to-review-source-code-says-poll-watchdog |title=Comelec failed to review source code, says poll watchdog |last1=Aning |first1=Jerome |date=May 29, 2013 |website=Inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2016 general elections, the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] leased 94,000 new [[Optical mark recognition]] (OMR) machines from London-based electronic voting technology company [[Smartmatic]], while the old ones would be refurbished for the 2019 elections, in a contract totalling 7.9 billion pesos.&lt;ref name=lease&gt;{{Cite web |last=Gotinga |first=JC |title=Comelec to lease 94,000 new machines for 2016 elections |website=CNN Philippines |url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/08/13/Comelec-decision-lease-94K-new-machines.html |date=August 14, 2015 |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] had invalidated the 300 million-peso contract between the Commission on Elections and Smartmatic-TIM for diagnostics and repair of the 80,000 [[Optical scan voting system|Precinct Count Optical Scan]] (PCOS) machines in April 2015, ruling that the commission "failed to justify its resort to direct contracting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Marueñas |title=SC voids Comelec deal for PCOS repair, diagnostics |work=GMA News |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/473554/news/nation/sc-voids-comelec-deal-for-pcos-repair-diagnostics |date=April 21, 2015 |accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restarting the process, in June 2015, the commission conducted a mock election using  a "hybrid" system of manual counting and electronic transmission of results. Former elections commissioner Gus Lagman argued in favor of the hybrid system, referring to its reliability against manipulation, as opposed to full automation, and the lower price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Remitio |first=Rex |title=Comelec holds mock elections, tests hybrid system |publisher=CNN Philippines |url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/06/27/Commission-on-Elections-Comelec-holds-mock-elections-tests-hybrid-system.html |date=June 27, 2015 |accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Francis Escudero]] disapproved of the use of the hybrid system, saying "it brings back memories of the [[Hello Garci scandal|Hello Garci controversy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Reyes |first=Ernie |title=Chiz asks Comelec: Drop hybrid poll, go for full automation |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/113745/chiz-asks-comelec-drop-hybrid-poll-go-for-full-automation |date=July 5, 2015 |accessdate = July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a few days later, the Commission informed the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives Committee on Suffrage and Electoral Reforms]] that they had decided not to use the hybrid system. They also limited their options to either refurbishing 80,000 counting machines and leasing 23,000 more, or leasing all machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Diaz |first=Jess |title=Comelec junks hybrid poll option for full automation |newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]]|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/10/1475254/comelec-junks-hybrid-poll-option-full-automation |accessdate=July 10, 2015 |date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the Commission had overturned its self-imposed disqualification of Smartmatic from bidding on counting machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Crisostomo |first=Sheila |title=Comelec reverses ruling disqualifying Smartmatic |newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]] |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/01/1471983/comelec-reverses-ruling-disqualifying-smartmatic |accessdate=July 7, 2015 |date=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a committee hearing held in late July, Elections chairman [[Andres D. Bautista]] told lawmakers that the commission had decided to award Smartmatic-TIM a 1.7 billion peso contract to lease 23,000 [[Optical mark recognition|OMR]] counting machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Diaz |first=Jess |title=Comelec: Smartmatic bags P1.7-B PCOS deal |newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]] |url=http://www.philstar.com:8080/headlines/2015/07/30/1482504/comelec-smartmatic-bags-p1.7-b-pcos-deal |date=July 30, 2015 |accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, the commission declared the bidding for the refurbishment of 80,000 machines a failure, after two of the three bidders backed out, stating the project would be unfeasible at the commission's tight schedule, while the third bidder was disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Crisostomo |first=Shiela |title=Bidding failure declared anew for PCOS upgrade |newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]] |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/08/02/1483601/bidding-failure-declared-anew-pcos-upgrade |date=August 2, 2015 |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, the commission agreed to lease 94,000 new OMR machines from Smartmatic, while the old machines used in 2010 and 2013 would be refurbished for the 2019 elections, in a contract totalling 7.9 billion pesos.&lt;ref name=lease /&gt; Smartmatic also won a 500 million pesos contract for electronic results transmission services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Comelec: Intel shows China may sabotage 2016 polls |website=[[GMA News]] |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/545926/news/nation/smartmatic-bags-p500-m-electronic-results-transmission-deal |date=November 26, 2015 |accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Security provisions====
Having received military intelligence reports in July that [[China]] might sabotage the elections, in September 2015 the commission sought the production of the voting machines be transferred from China to [[Taiwan]]. While manufacturer Smartmatic acquiesced to the request, China denied any sabotage plans, calling it "sheer fabrication."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Romero |first=Paolo |title=Comelec: Intel shows China may sabotage 2016 polls |website=[[The Philippine Star]] |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/09/17/1500723/comelec-intel-shows-china-may-sabotage-2016-polls |date=September 17, 2015 |accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission partnered with [[De La Salle University]] to conduct the [[source code]] review, that was said to be more comprehensive than the 2010 and 2013 reviews, which were done just a month and four days ahead of the election, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hegina |first=Aries Joseph |title=Comelec woos public’s trust in holding source code review months ahead of polls |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/729146/comelec-woos-publics-trust-in-holding-source-code-review-months-ahead-of-polls |date=August 10, 2015 |accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The warehouse of the voting machines and the paper bins was moved to the warehouse of bus company [[Jam Liner]] in [[Sta. Rosa, Laguna]]. The commission paid 69 million pesos for renting the warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gotinga |first=JC |title=LOOK: Laguna warehouse of vote counting machines |publisher=[[CNN Philippines]] |url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/01/29/vote-counting-machines-warehouse-laguna.html |date=January 29, 2016 |accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Witch trials in early modern Scotland''' were the judicial proceedings in Scotland between the early sixteenth century and the mid-eighteenth century concerned with crimes of witchcraft. In the late middle age there were a handful of prosecutions for harm done through witchcraft, but the passing of the [[Witchcraft Act 1563]] made witchcraft, or consulting with witches, capital crimes. The first major series of trials under the new act were the [[North Berwick witch trials]], beginning in 1589, in which [[James VI and I|King James VI]] played a major part as "victim" and investigator. He became interested in witchcraft and published a defence of witch-hunting in the ''[[Daemonologie]]'' in 1597, but he appears to have become increasingly sceptical and eventually took steps to limit prosecutions.

An estimated 4,000 to 6,000 people, mostly from the [[Scottish Lowlands]], were tried for witchcraft in this period, a much higher rate than for neighbouring England. There were major series of trials in [[North Berwick witch trials|1590–91]], [[The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597|1597]], 1628–31, [[Great Scottish witch hunt of 1649–50|1649–50]] and [[The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1661–1662|1661–62]]. Seventy-five per cent of the accused were women. Modern estimates indicate that more than 1,500 persons were executed; most were strangled and then burned. The hunts subsided under English occupation after the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil Wars]] during the period of the [[Scotland under the Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] led by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in the 1650s, but returned after the [[Restoration in Scotland|Restoration]] in 1660, causing some alarm and leading to the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] limiting arrests, prosecutions and torture. There was also growing scepticism in the later seventeenth century, while some of the factors that may have contributed to the trials, such as economic distress, subsided.  Although there were occasional local outbreaks of witch-hunting, the last recorded executions were in 1706 and the last trial in 1727. The Scottish and English parliaments [[Acts of Union 1707|merged in 1707]], and the unified British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in [[Witchcraft Act of 1735|1736]].

Many causes have been suggested for the hunts, including economic distress, changing attitudes to women, the rise of a "godly state",&lt;ref name=Sharpe2002pp185-9&gt;J. Sharpe, "Witch-hunting and witch historiography: some Anglo-Scottish comparisons", in J. Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6024-9}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;185–9.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[inquisitorial]] Scottish judicial system, the widespread use of [[judicial torture]], the role of the local kirk, decentralised justice and the prevalence of the idea of the [[Deal with the Devil|diabolic pact]]. The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch-hunt has led some historians to proffer the concept of "associated circumstances", rather than one single significant cause.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp88-90/&gt;

==Origins==

===Legal origins===
[[File:Daemonologie1.jpg|thumb|Illustration of witches, perhaps being tortured before [[James VI and I|James VI]], from his ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597)]]
For late Medieval Scotland there is evidence of occasional prosecutions of individuals for causing harm through witchcraft. High-profile political cases included the action against [[John Stewart, Earl of Mar (d. 1479)|John Stewart, Earl of Mar]] for allegedly using sorcery against his brother King [[James III of Scotland|James III]] in 1479.&lt;ref name=Goodare2001pp644-5&gt;J. Goodare, "Witch-hunts", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;644–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of these political cases indicates that they were becoming rarer in the first half of the sixteenth century however.&lt;ref name=Edwards2010p32&gt;K. A. Edwards, "Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart Scotland", in K. Cartwright, ''A Companion to Tudor Literature Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture'' (Oxford: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010), {{ISBN|1-4051-5477-2}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular belief in magic was widespread in the Middle Ages, but theologians had been generally sceptical, and lawyers only interested in prosecuting cases in which harm from magic was evident. From the late sixteenth century attitudes began to change, and witches were seen as deriving powers from the Devil, with the result that witchcraft was seen as a form of [[heresy]]. These ideas were widely accepted by both Catholics and Protestants in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Goodare2001pp644-5/&gt; In the aftermath of the initial [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Reformation settlement of 1560]], Parliament passed the [[Witchcraft Act 1563]], one of a series of laws underpinning Biblical laws&lt;ref name=Goodare2001pp644-5/&gt; and similar to that passed in England a year earlier, which made the practice of witchcraft itself, and consulting with witches, capital crimes.&lt;ref name=Edwards2010p32/&gt; The first witch-hunt under the act was in the east of the country in 1568–69 in [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] and the [[Kincardineshire|Mearns]],&lt;ref&gt;L. Normand and G. Roberts, ''Witchcraft in early modern Scotland: James VI's demonology and the North Berwick witches'' (Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 2000), 085989388X, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; where there were unsuccessful attempts to introduce elements of the [[Deal with the Devil|diabolic pact]] and the hunt collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;L. Martin, "The Devil and domestic witchcraft: witchcraft, quarrels and women's work in Scotland" n J. Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6024-9}}, p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of James VI===
{{Main article|James VI and I}}
James VI's visit to Denmark in 1589, where witch-hunts were already common, may have encouraged an interest in the study of witchcraft, and he came to see the storms he encountered on his voyage as the result of magic.&lt;ref&gt;P. Croft, ''King James'' (Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), {{ISBN|0-333-61395-3}}, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; After his return to Scotland, he attended the [[North Berwick witch trials]], the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the 1563 Act and the first known to successfully involve the diabolic pact. Several people, most notably [[Agnes Sampson]] and the schoolmaster [[John Fian]], were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James' ship. James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches. He subsequently believed that a nobleman, [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]], was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects. James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches.&lt;ref name=Keay&amp;Keay1994p556/&gt; Inspired by his personal involvement, in 1597 he wrote the ''[[Daemonologie]]'', a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare's ''[[MacBeth|Tragedy of Macbeth]]'', which contains probably the most famous literary depiction of Scottish witches.&lt;ref name=Keay&amp;Keay1994p556&gt;J. Keay and J. Keay, ''Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland'' (London: Harper Collins, 1994), {{ISBN|0-00-255082-2}}, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt;

James imported continental explanations of witchcraft. In the view of Thomas Lolis, James I's goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lolis, "The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the Homosocial Refashioning of the Witches’ Community", ''CLIO'' (2008) 37(3), pp. 322-37.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the publication of ''Daemonologie'' his views became more sceptical,&lt;ref&gt;P. Croft, ''King James'' (Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), {{ISBN|0-333-61395-3}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year he revoked the standing commissions on witchcraft, limiting prosecutions by the central courts.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp168-9/&gt;

==Nature of the trials==
Despite the fact that Scotland probably had about one quarter of the population of England, it had three times the number of witchcraft prosecutions, at an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 over the entire period.&lt;ref name=Edwards2010p32/&gt; This was about four times the European average.&lt;ref name=Goodare2001pp644-5/&gt; The overwhelming majority were in the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]],&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp168-9/&gt; where the [[Church of Scotland|Kirk]] had more control, despite the evidence that basic magical beliefs were very widespread in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]].&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp88-90/&gt; Persecution of [[witchcraft in Orkney]] differed from the mainland with most trials taking place before 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Liv Helene Willumsen, "Witches of the North: Scotland and Finnmark", (BRILL, 2013), {{ISBN|978-90-04-25292-9}}, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Large series of trials included those in 1590–91 and [[the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597]], which took place across Scotland from March to October. At least 400 people were put on trial for various forms of diabolism. The exact number of those executed as a result of these trials is unknown, but is believed to be about 200. Later major trials included hunts in 1628–31 and [[Great Scottish witch hunt of 1649-50|1649–50]]. Probably the most intense witch-hunt was in [[The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1661–1662|1661–62]], which involved some 664 named witches in four counties.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Levack, "The decline and end of Scottish witch-hunting", in J. Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6024-9}}, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Witch-pricking Needles00.gif|thumb|left|upright|False witch-pricking bodkins from [[Reginald Scott]]'s ''[[Discovery of Witchcraft]]'', 1584]]
Most of the accused, some 75 per cent, were women. Modern estimates indicate that over 1,500 persons were executed.&lt;ref name=Brown2012p81&gt;S. J. Brown, "Religion and society to c. 1900", T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0-19-956369-1}}, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these were older women, with some younger women and men accused because they were related to an accused witch, usually as daughters and husbands. Some men were accused because they were [[folk healer]]s, who were felt to have misused their powers, although folk healers as a group were not targeted. Most were not vagrants or beggars, but settled members of their communities. Most had built a reputation for witchcraft over years, which resulted in prosecution when a "victim" suffered ill fortune, particularly after a [[curse]] had been issued. The use of curses by some women as a means of acquiring social power may have made this process more likely to occur.&lt;ref name=Goodare2001pp644-5/&gt;

Almost all witchcraft prosecutions took place in secular courts under the provisions of the 1563 Act.&lt;ref name=Levack1987pp87-8/&gt; In 1649 the religiously radical [[Covenanter]] regime passed a new witchcraft act that ratified the existing act and extended it to deal with consulters of "Devils and familiar spirits", who would now be punished with death.&lt;ref name=Young2006pp149-50&gt;J. R. Young, "The Covenanters and the Scottish Parliament, 1639–51: the rule of the godly and the 'second Scottish Reformation'", E. Boran and C. Gribben, eds, ''Enforcing Reformation in Ireland and Scotland, 1550–1700'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), {{ISBN|0-7546-8223-4}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; There were three main types of court in which accused witches could be tried. First was the [[High Court of Justiciary|Court of Justiciary]] in Edinburgh, which took cases from all over Scotland, with a heavy bias to the local region. Next were the [[circuit courts]], presided over by judges from the central courts and held in the various shires of the country. Finally, there were a series of ''ad hoc'' local courts, held under commissions by the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]] or Parliament and staffed by local landholders and gentlemen to try witches in the places where they were accused. Based on known outcomes, the execution rates for the local courts was much higher than the courts run by professional lawyers, with the local courts executing some 90 per cent of the accused, the Judiciary Court 55 per cent, but the circuit courts only 16 per cent.&lt;ref name=Levack1987pp87-8&gt;B. P. Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe'' (London: Longman, 1987), {{ISBN|0-582-49123-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;87–9.&lt;/ref&gt; After the revocation of the standing commissions in 1597, the pursuit of witchcraft was largely taken over by [[kirk session]]s, disciplinary committees run by the parish elite, and was often used to attack "superstitious" and Catholic practices.&lt;ref name=Brown2012p81/&gt; The central courts only launched a trial when the Privy Council issued a commission, although the council did not have full control over prosecutions in the Court of Judiciary.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp88-90/&gt;

Scottish witchcraft trials were notable for their use of [[pricking]],&lt;ref name=Goodare2001pp644-5/&gt; in which a suspect's skin was pierced with needles, pins and bodkins as it was believed that they would possess a [[Witches' mark|Devil's mark]] through which they could not feel pain.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe'' (London: Pearson, 3rd edn., 2006), {{ISBN|0-582-41901-8}}, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional prickers included John Kincaid and John Dick, whose actions helped set off the outbreak of witch-hunting in  1661–62, and whose exposure as frauds, and subsequent imprisonment, helped end the trials.&lt;ref&gt;D. Burton and D. Grandy, ''Magic, Mystery, and Science: The Occult in Western Civilization'' (Indiana University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-253-21656-7}}, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial torture was used in some high-profile cases, like that of John Fine, one of the witches accused of plotting the death of the king in 1590, whose feet were crushed in a shin press, known as [[Boot (torture)|the boots]].&lt;ref name=Levack1987p74&gt;B. P. Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe'' (London: Longman, 1987), {{ISBN|0-582-49123-1}}, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these cases were relatively rare. Confessions, considered the best evidence for conviction, were more usually extracted by "waking" the witch, keeping the suspect [[Sleep deprivation|sleep deprived]]. After about three days individuals tend to hallucinate, and this provided some exotic detail in witchcraft trials.&lt;ref name=Goodare2001pp644-5/&gt; In Scotland, convicted witches were usually strangled at the stake before having their bodies burned, although there are instances where they were [[burned at the stake|burned alive]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Goodare, "Introduction", in J. Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6024-9}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Brodie-Innes, ''Scottish Witchcraft Trials'' (1891, Kessinger Publishing, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7661-6555-8}}, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Witch beliefs==
[[File:Daemonologie2.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of Doctor Fian, from ''[[Newes from Scotland]]'']]
The belief that witches could cause harm was common among all social groups in early modern Scotland. In 1701 in [[Anstruther]], Elizabeth Dick had been turned away from the local mill when begging. She cursed the mill and several witnesses testified that the grain in the mill turned red. Only when one of the people who had refused her help ran after her and gave her alms did she bless the mill and everything returned to normal.&lt;ref&gt;S. MacDonald, "In search of the devil in Fife witchcraft cases 1560–1705", in J. Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6024-9}}, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; About half of accused witches had already gained a reputation for causing harm over a long period of time.&lt;ref name=Goodare2001pp644-5/&gt; The fact that only four per cent of recorded accused witches were involved in folk healing seems to indicate that healing skills were largely seen as different from witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;J. McCallum, ''Reforming the Scottish Parish: The Reformation in Fife, 1560–1640'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7546-9624-3}}, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aberdeenshire trials of 1596 reveal that spells could be purchased from folk magicians for success at fishing, to ensure a happy marriage, to prolong life and to affect the weather, but harmful spells were considered witchcraft. Many accusations included sexual fears. Margaret Bain, a midwife, it was claimed, could transfer the pains of childbirth to a woman's husband and Helen Gray cast a spell on a man that gave him a permanent erection.&lt;ref&gt;L. Henderson, "'Detestable slaves of the Devil': Changing ideas about witchcraft in sixteenth-century Scotland" in E. J. Cowan and L.

These included by reading the marks on the shoulder blade of a slaughtered animal, measuring a person's sleeve or waist to see if they were suffering from a fever, or being able to find answers based on which way a sieve suspended from scissors or shears swung, as  Margaret Mungo was accused of doing before the kirk session of [[Dingwall]] in 1649.&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Maxwell-Stuart, ''Satan's Conspiracy: Magic and Witchcraft in Sixteenth-century Scotland'' (Dundurn, 2001), {{ISBN|1-86232-136-1}}, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has often been stated that Scottish witchcraft was particularly concerned with the demonic pact. In the high court, Katherine Sands, who was one of four women accused of witchcraft at [[Culross]] in 1675, admitted to renouncing her baptism, receiving the Devil's mark and having sex with the Devil, but in local trials these demonic elements were rarer.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;S. MacDonald, "In search of the devil in Fife witchcraft cases 1560–1705", in J. Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6024-9}}, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart MacDonald notes that in trials from Fife the Devil was a relatively insignificant and indistinct figure and that a number of instances of [[coven]]s meeting look like fairy revels, where the dancing fairies traditionally disappeared when a human broke the ring, rather than satanic gatherings.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt; Fairies were an important part of magical beliefs in Scotland. [[Isobel Gowdie]], the young wife of a [[cottar]] from near [[Auldearn]], who was tried for witchcraft in 1662, left four depositions, gained without torture, that provide one of the most detailed insights into magical beliefs in Britain. She stated that her coven met on nearby [[Downie Hills|Downie Hill]], that they could transform themselves into hares and that she had been entertained by the [[Queen of the Fairies]] in her home under the hill.&lt;ref&gt;E. Wilby, ''The Visions of Isobel Gowdie: Magic, Witchcraft and Dark Shamanism in Seventeenth-century Scotland'' (Eastbourne: Sussex Academic Press, 2010), {{ISBN|1-84519-180-3}}, pp. 3, 79 and 138.&lt;/ref&gt; J. A. MacCulloch argued that there was a "mingling of beliefs" in Scotland, between popular belief in fairies and elite Christian ideas of demonic action.&lt;ref&gt;S. MacDonald, "In search of the devil in Fife witchcraft cases 1560–1705", in J. Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6024-9}}, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
In the seventeenth century there was growing scepticism about the reality of witchcraft among the educated elite.&lt;ref name=Goodare2001pp644-5/&gt; Scotland was defeated in the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil Wars]] by the forces of the English parliament led by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and occupied. In 1652 Scotland was declared part of a [[Scotland under the Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] with England and Ireland and the Privy Council and courts ceased to exist. The English judges who replaced them were hostile to the use of torture and often sceptical of the evidence it produced, resulting in a decline in prosecutions.&lt;ref name=Levak2002pp166-80/&gt; In an attempt to gain support among the landholding orders, Sheriff's courts were re-established and Justices of the Peace returned in 1656. The result was a wave of witchcraft cases, with 102 in the period 1657–59. The limitations on prosecutions were fully reversed with the [[Restoration in Scotland|Restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, and there was a flood of over 600 cases&lt;ref name=Lynch1991p286&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: a New History'' (London: Random House, 1991), {{ISBN|1-4464-7563-8}}, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; that alarmed the restored Privy Council, leading it to insist on the necessity of its commission for an arrest or prosecution, and banning judicial torture.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp88-90/&gt;

[[File:SinclairSatansWorld1685.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Reprint of the title page of [[George Sinclair (mathematician)|George Sinclair]]'s ''Satans Invisible World'' (1685), one of the many tracts published in Scotland arguing against sceptical views of witchcraft]]
Prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised.&lt;ref name=Levak2002pp166-80/&gt; The exposure of prickers as frauds in 1662 removed a major form of evidence.&lt;ref name=Goodare2001pp644-5/&gt; The [[Lord Advocate]] [[George Mackenzie (lawyer)|George Mackenzie]] made efforts to make prosecutions ineffective.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp88-90/&gt; There may also have been a growing popular scepticism, and, with relative peace and stability, the economic and social tensions that may have contributed to accusations were reduced, although there were occasional local outbreaks, like those in East Lothian in 1678 and in [[Paisley witches|Paisley in 1697]]. The last executions in the records of the central courts were in 1706. The last trial was held in the court of a sheriff-depute at [[Dornoch]] in 1727, and was of questionable legality. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in [[Witchcraft Act of 1735|1736]], making the legal pursuit of witches impossible.&lt;ref name=Levak2002pp166-80&gt;B. P. Levack, "The decline and end of Scottish witch-hunting", in J. Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6024-9}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;166–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, basic magical beliefs persisted, particularly in the Highlands and Islands.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp88-90/&gt;

==Causes==
Various reasons for the Scottish witch-hunt, and its more intense nature than that in England, have been advanced by historians. Older theories, that there was a widespread [[Witch-cult hypothesis|pagan cult]] that was persecuted in this period and that the witch-hunts were the result of a rising [[medical profession]] eliminating folk healers, have been discredited among professional historians.&lt;ref name=Goodare2001pp644-5/&gt; Most of the major periods of prosecution coincided with periods of intense economic distress,&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp168-9&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;168–9.&lt;/ref&gt; and some accusations may have followed the withdrawal of charity from marginal figures, particularly the single women that made up many of the accused.&lt;ref&gt;L. Martin, "The Devil and the domestic: witchcraft, quarrels and women's work in Scotland", in J. Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6024-9}}, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The reformed Kirk that emerged from 1560 was heavily influenced by [[Calvinism]] and [[Presbyterianism]], and may have perceived women as more of a moral threat.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp88-90&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|0-7486-0233-X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;88–9.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result the witch-hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women.&lt;ref name=Brown2012p81/&gt; Christina Larner suggested that the outbreak of the hunt in the mid-sixteenth century was tied to the rise of a "godly state", where the reformed Kirk was closely linked to an increasingly intrusive Scottish crown and legal system.

It has been suggested that the intensity of Scottish witch-hunting was due to an [[inquisitorial]] judicial system and the widespread use of judicial torture. However, [[Brian P. Levack]] argues that the Scottish system was only partly inquisitorial and that use of judicial torture was extremely limited, similar to the situation in England. A relatively high level of acquittal in Scottish trials may have been due to the employment of defence lawyers in Scottish courts, a benefit not given accused witches in England. The close involvement of the Scottish Kirk in trials and the decentralised nature of Scottish courts, where local magistrates heard many cases (in contrast to England where most were before a small number of [[Circuit judge (England and Wales)|circuit judge]]s), may have contributed to higher rates of prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Levack, "State Building and witch-hunting in early modern Europe", in J. Barry, M. Hester, and G. Roberts, eds, ''Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0-521-63875-5}}, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The diabolic pact is often stated as a major difference between Scottish and English witchcraft cases, but Stuart Maxwell argues that the iconography of Satan may be an imposition of central government beliefs on local traditions, particularly those concerned with [[fairy|fairies]], which were more persistent in Scotland than in England.&lt;ref&gt;S. MacDonald, "In search of the devil in Fife witchcraft cases 1560–1705", in J. Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6024-9}}, pp. 34 and 47-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch-hunt has led some historians to proffer the concept of "associated circumstances", rather than one single significant cause.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp88-90/&gt;{{clear}}

A '''high-income economy''' is defined by the [[World Bank]] as a country with a [[gross national income]] per capita US$12,056 or more in 2017, calculated using the [[Atlas method]].&lt;ref name="wb"/&gt; While the term "high-income" is often used interchangeably with "[[First World]]" and "[[developed country]]", the technical definitions of these terms differ. The term "first world" commonly refers to countries that aligned themselves with the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[NATO]] during the [[Cold War]]. Several institutions, such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) or [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), take factors other than high [[per capita income]] into account when classifying countries as "developed" or "advanced economies". According to the [[United Nations]], for example, some high-income countries may also be developing countries. The [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] countries, for example, are classified as developing high-income countries. Thus, a high-income country may be classified as either developed or [[Developing country|developing]].&lt;ref name="UN. (2005). UNCTAD Handbook of Statistics."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/tdstat30_enfr.pdf|title=UN. (2005). UNCTAD Handbook of Statistics.|accessdate=2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Holy See]] is a [[sovereign state]], it is not classified by the World Bank under this definition.

==List of high-income economies (as of 2019 fiscal year)==
According to the World Bank the following 81 countries (including territories) are classified as "high-income economies".&lt;ref name="wb"&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-and-lending-groups#High_income Country and Lending Groups.] [[World Bank]]. Accessed on July 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In brackets the year(s) during which they held such classification.
As of the 2019 fiscal year, high-income economies are those that had a GNI per capita of $12,056 or more—in 2017.

==Historical thresholds==

The high-income threshold was originally set in 1989 at US$6,000 in 1987 prices. Thresholds for subsequent years were adjusted taking into account the average [[inflation]] in the [[Group of Five|G-5 countries]] ([[United States|the United States]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|the United Kingdom]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]] and [[France]]), and from 2001, that of [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and the [[eurozone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20452009~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html The Atlas Method], [[World Bank]].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the thresholds remain constant in real terms over time.&lt;ref name="worldbank1"/&gt; To ensure no country falls right on the threshold, country data are rounded to the nearest 10 and income thresholds are rounded to the nearest 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Interim Measure for calculating financial contributions: review of cut-off points defining capacity-to-pay groups |url=http://iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/future/60-F&amp;A4.pdf |work=Agenda item 4|date=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows the high-income threshold from 1987 onwards. Countries with a [[GNI per capita]] (calculated using the Atlas method) above this threshold are classified by the World Bank as "high-income economies".&lt;ref name="worldbank1"/&gt;
