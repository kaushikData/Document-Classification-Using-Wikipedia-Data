      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2992">The '''1977–78 Cuban National Series''' was a watershed in that it coincided with [[Cuba]]'s administrative restructuring of 1977, which created [[Provinces of Cuba|fourteen provinces]]. Pinar del Río's Vegueros won the title, with a slim victory over [[Havana]]'s [[Industriales]].

==Restructuring==
Teams were renamed along these lines, many taking the names of their new locations.

Three provinces kept two teams:
*[[Havana]] (city): [[Industriales]] and [[Metropolitanos]]
*[[Pinar del Río Province]]: Vegueros and Forestales
*[[Matanzas Province]]: Citricultores and Henequeneros

Additionally, the special administrative area of [[Isla de la Juventud]] had its own team, despite not being a province.

This league structure survives today in a similar form.

'''Qualification''' for the '''2013 [[United States Men's Curling Championship]]''' consisted of three different paths. Four teams qualified directly through the High Performance Program or the Order of Merit system. The number of the remaining entrants to the national championships was cut down to six teams through a challenge round held in early January.

==Qualification system==
Teams qualified to participate in the men's national championship through the High Performance Program, through the [[World Curling Tour]] Order of Merit, or through a challenge round.

===Automatic qualification===
Two spots in the nationals were awarded to two teams on the [[United States Curling Association]]'s High Performance National Program, established as an invitation-based program for the development of the top curling teams in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curlingrocks.net/sites/default/files/press_pdf/national_program_teams2.pdf|title=Eight teams invited to High Performance National Program|date=7 July 2011|publisher=[[United States Curling Association]]|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams qualified through the High Performance Program were those skipped by [[Pete Fenson]] and [[Heath McCormick]]. Two more spots were awarded to the top two men's teams on the World Curling Tour Order of Merit standings table following the conclusion of the [[Iron Trail Motors Shoot-Out]]. If one or both of the top teams were already qualified for the nationals through the High Performance Program, the spot or spots would have been awarded to the team with the next highest position on the Order of Merit.&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacurl.org/curlingrocks//images//rules_102412.pdf|title=2012–2013 USCA Rules of Curling and Competition|publisher=[[United States Curling Association]]|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams qualified through the Order of Merit were those skipped by [[Tyler George]] and [[John Shuster]].

===Challenge Round===
The remaining six spots in the nationals will be awarded to the teams that earn qualification spots through the [[#Challenge Round 2|challenge round]]. The challenge round was held in a triple knockout format, and was an open registration event. The teams that entered the challenge round were seeded through a strength of field ranking and through a peer ranking. The strength of field ranking was based on players' participation and performance in national championships and world championships.

'''BC Rustavi''' ({{lang-ka|'''საკალათბურთო კლუბი რუსთავი'''}}) is a professional basketball club based in the city of [[Rustavi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The club competes in the [[Georgian Superliga]], and plays its home games in the Rustavi sports arena.

==History==

The club was founded in 1991 as BC Azoti, and began competing in the newly established [[Georgian Superliga|Georgian national league]]. It is one of only 2 clubs (the other being [[BC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]]) to have participated in the league continuously throughout its existence. Rustavi challenged for high positions in the league on a consistent basis, and recorded numerous top 3 finishes, always falling short of winning trophies.

The club's fortunes changed in 2006, when it acquired major sponsorship from the investment company 'Energy Invest'. They were now able to attract some of the best Georgian players to the club, as well as foreign imports. As a result, Rustavi convincingly won 4 league championships in a row, between 2007 and 2010. In addition, they won the Georgian cup in 2009, and numerous smaller national competitions. At the end of the 2009/10 season, 'Energy Invest' announced that the level of funding for the club would diminish, forcing them to compete with a young team and modest ambitions for 2 years. In 2012, the funding increased once more, and the squad was considerably strengthened.

Rustavi took part in various international competitions on several occasions, such as the [[Korać Cup]] in 1997, 98 and 99; the [[Eurocup Basketball|Eurocup]] in 2007; and the [[EuroChallenge]] in 2008, but failed to advance beyond the qualifying rounds on each occasion.

'''Boikoo tarkbei''' or '''Daur hockey''' is a game similar to [[field hockey]] or [[street hockey]]. It has been played for about 1,000 years&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/sports/olympics/23hockey.html|title=A Chinese Hinterland, Fertile With Field Hockey|last=McGrath|first=Charles|date=August 22, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Daur people|Daur]] people, an ethnic group from [[Inner Mongolia]], [[China]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

The game involves teams of men playing a ball-like knob of [[apricot]] root (''in lieu'' of a ball) with long wooden branches (''in lieu'' of sticks).&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; At night, the game is played with a [[felt]]-covered ball that is set alight.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; A game is reported to last for two periods of roughly 15 minutes.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

'''Poolie tarkbei''' is the Daur version of [[polo]]. Boikoo and poolie are two popular game among Daurs.

Some Daurs believe the [[Daur language|Daur]] term ''boikoo'' and ''poolie'' was originated from Chinese term ''buqiu'' ([[budaqiu]] or buqiu was a popular game in [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]]) and Tibetan term ''polon'', and deny the Khitan origin of Daurs. Others believe the Daur boikoo was originated from the '''Khitan hockey'''.[http://www.dawoer.com/bbs/dispbbs.asp?BoardID=15&amp;ID=48835]

When Western field hockey was introduced to China, it was taken up enthusiastically by the Daurs, whose affinity for the game has helped China to improve its global standing in field hockey.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; At the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], a third of the [[China men's national field hockey team|Chinese men's field hockey team]] was from [[Morin Dawa]], a city in the [[Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner]] in Inner Mongolia.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

'''Bruce David Grobbelaar''' (born 6 October 1957) is a former [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe international]] [[association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], most prominently for the English team [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] between 1981 and 1994. He is remembered for his gymnastic-like athletic ability, unflappable confidence and eccentric and flamboyant style of play. He has been the goalkeeper coach for [[Ottawa Fury FC]] of the [[North American Soccer League]] since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewesternstar.com/Sports/2014-07-30/article-3816622/Grobbelaar-nets-coaching-gig-with-Ottawa-Fury/1|title=Grobbelaar nets coaching gig with Ottawa Fury|date=30 July 2014 |work=[[The Western Star (Corner Brook)|The Western Star]]|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018 he was announced as goalkeeper coach for the [[Matabeleland football team]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/JustinWalley10/status/972063066291605504]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in South Africa, Grobbelaar grew up in neighbouring [[Rhodesia]] (today Zimbabwe), and served in the [[Rhodesian Army]] before he joined the [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1974–84)|Vancouver Whitecaps]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] in 1979. He gained Liverpool's attention during a loan spell at [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] during the 1979–80 season, and signed for the Merseyside club in 1981. Making 628 appearances for Liverpool over the next 13 years, including 440 in the League, he won the League championship with the club six times, as well as three [[FA Cup]]s, three [[Football League Cup|League Cups]] and the [[1983–84 European Cup|1983–84]] [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]].

Grobbelaar left Liverpool for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 1994, transferred to [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] two years later, and thereafter played for an assortment of English lower-league teams, never for more than a few games.

==Club career==

===Early years===
In his teenage years, Grobbelaar was a talented [[cricket]]er and was offered a [[baseball]] scholarship in the United States, but a career in football was his main ambition. His footballing career started with a [[Bulawayo]]-based team, [[Highlanders FC]], in [[Rhodesia]]'s second biggest city. In his late teens he was signed up by [[Durban City Football Club]] in South Africa, but left claiming to have been sidelined owing to his colour in this predominantly black team — the team had played in an all-white league until the previous year. Immediately after leaving Highlands Park, he was conscripted into National Service, spending eleven months on active service in the [[Rhodesia Regiment]] during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].&lt;ref name="BBC210918"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bruce Grobbelaar: Ex-Liverpool goalkeeper talks war horrors, Heysel and match-fixing |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45596056 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=21 September 2018 |date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 Grobbelaar was signed by the [[Vancouver Whitecaps (NASL)|Vancouver Whitecaps]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|NASL]] after he had attended their [[scout (sport)|scouting]] camp in South Africa.

===Vancouver Whitecaps===
At the Vancouver Whitecaps, Grobbelaar played under the management of former [[England national football team|England]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] goalkeeper, [[Tony Waiters]], making his debut on 4 August 1979 against the [[Los Angeles Aztecs]] away.  The Whitecaps lost 0–2, [[Johan Cruyff]] scoring one of the Aztecs' goals.  Grobbelaar spent the rest of the season as second choice to former [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] keeper [[Phil Parkes (footballer born 1947)|Phil Parkes]].

During 1979, he visited England to see family friends, and a chance phone call from [[Ron Atkinson]], brought him an impromptu trial with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].  Atkinson was keen to sign Grobbelaar but owing to difficulties over gaining a work permit, the deal fell through.   In stepped [[Crewe Alexandra]], signing Grobbelaar on loan on 18 December 1979.  In an early League appearance for the Railwaymen in Division 4, the unknown Grobbelaar was named on the Team Sheet in the [[York City]] Match Day Programme as "Bill Grobbelaar".  During his time at Crewe, Grobbelaar played 24 [[The Football League|League]] games and scored his only professional goal, a penalty, in his last game.  By good fortune, on the evening when he gave his greatest performance for [[Crewe Alexandra|Crewe]], he was spotted by Liverpool's head scout [[Tom Saunders]].

At the end of the loan period, Grobbelaar returned to Vancouver for the [[1980 North American Soccer League season|1980 NASL season]].  Although the Whitecaps had signed former Scotland international [[David Harvey (footballer)|David Harvey]] from [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], Grobbelaar emerged as first choice and became a cult figure for the Whitecaps faithful.

===Liverpool===
By the time Liverpool FC had completed their research on Grobbelaar, he had returned to Vancouver with his loan spell now over. Liverpool approached Tony Waiters with the idea of taking Grobbelaar to [[Anfield]], and Waiters, who had a working relationship with Liverpool in the 1970s, paved the way for the move. Grobbelaar signed for Liverpool for £250,000 on 17 March 1981 as their reserve goalkeeper, but in mid-1981, regular goalkeeper [[Ray Clemence]]'s surprise departure to [[Tottenham Hotspur]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} gave Grobbelaar his opportunity.

Grobbelaar made his debut on 28 August 1981 but failed to prevent [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] winning the league fixture 1–0 at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/viewgame.asp?game_id=1219|title=Wolverhampton Wanderers 1–0 Liverpool|date=29 August 1981|work=LFC History|accessdate=13 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622103959/http://www.lfchistory.net/viewgame.asp?game_id=1219|archivedate=22 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also making their debuts were defender [[Mark Lawrenson]] and midfielder [[Craig Johnston]]. His first clean sheet came a fortnight later at [[Anfield]] on 5 September, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] were the visitors who were beaten by a 2–0 scoreline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfchistory.net/viewgame.asp?game_id=1221 |title=Liverpool 2–0 Arsenal |date=5 September 1981 |work=LFC History |accessdate=13 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218145326/http://www.lfchistory.net/viewgame.asp?game_id=1221 |archivedate=18 February 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grobbelaar's early days as No.1 were strewn with errors and the Reds struggled to obtain any sort of consistency, Grobbelaar taking a lot of the blame. By the end of the calendar year Liverpool were mid table in the league and looked to be out of the running for [[Football League First Division|title]] honours, especially as they had just lost to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] 3–1 at Anfield in the [[Boxing Day]] fixture – a defeat which put [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond's]] team top of the league. The New Year brought a new momentum as [[Bob Paisley]] began to get the best out of his players; they began the year in [[South Wales]] visiting the [[Vetch Field]] to play [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in the [[FA Cup]], Liverpool were in fine form and thumped their hosts 4–0. This set them on their way in the league and dropped just seven of the 50 available points overhauling the points gap that [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] had opened on them.

Grobbelaar added the championship medal to the [[Football League Cup|Milk Cup]] winners medal he had gained at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] on 13 March; the Reds beat Spurs 3–1, who had Ray Clemence in goal.

During the period 1981–1994, Grobbelaar played 627 first team games for Liverpool, becoming known for his eccentric and flamboyant style. In 1984, the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final between Liverpool and [[A.S. Roma]] finished 1–1 after extra time, and went to a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]]. As Roma's [[Bruno Conti]] prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined-up behind, then proceeded to bite the back of the net, in imitation of eating spaghetti. Conti sent his spot kick over the bar. Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before [[Francesco Graziani]] took his kick, wobbling his legs in mock terror. Graziani missed and Liverpool went on to win the shootout 4–2.

Grobbelaar was retained by three of Liverpool's greatest managers; [[Bob Paisley|Paisley]], [[Joe Fagan|Fagan]] and [[Kenny Dalglish|Dalglish]], over a period of 13 years. His strengths were his gymnastic-like agility, and an unflappable confidence. He was never afraid to be seen to berate his defenders if he thought they had given easy opportunities to the opposition, such as in his verbal assault on [[Jim Beglin]] in the first all [[Merseyside derby|Merseyside]] [[FA Cup]] final against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 1986. Over the course of his Liverpool career he won more medals than any of his contemporaries.

In [[1984–85 in English football|1984–85]], Grobbelaar brought down a spectator who had invaded the pitch during a game, allowing the police to handcuff the offending spectator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqwq-wt69Vs&amp;feature=related |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628040905/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqwq-wt69Vs&amp;feature=related |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 June 2014 |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were occasional challenges to his position as Liverpool's number 1, Grobbelaar was a virtual ever-present from Clemence's departure to the start of the 1990s which coincided with the end of the club's dominance. He was an ever-present in his first five league campaigns at [[Anfield]], when Liverpool were champions four times and runners-up on the other occasion. However, in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]], injuries and illness restricted his first team opportunities and he played 21 times in the league, with [[Mike Hooper (footballer)|Mike Hooper]] taking his place on the other 17 occasions. However, he was fit to face Everton in the 3–2 FA Cup win on 20 May 1989, though six days later he conceded a last minute goal to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] midfielder [[Michael Thomas (footballer born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] on the final day of the league season as the league title was [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|wrenched from Liverpool's grasp]] and headed to [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] instead. A month earlier, he played in the FA Cup semi-final win over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] which was played at [[Old Trafford]] after [[Hillsborough disaster|the original match at]] [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] was cancelled due to the tragedy that led to 96 fans dying on terracing just behind Grobbelaar's goal. Grobbelaar attended many of the victims' funerals.

It was the signing of [[David James (footballer)|David James]] from [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in mid-1992 that spelt the beginning of the end for Grobbelaar. Although James struggled to impress at first, Grobbelaar's insistence on playing for [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] gave James chances; Grobbelaar only played six times for Liverpool during 1992–93 and spent a short period on loan at [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] where he made four appearances. James's uncertainty allowed Grobbelaar to regain his place in the first team at the start of the 1993–94 season, in which his performance, like the team's, started well but fell away badly. In a notorious incident in a Merseyside derby that year, Grobbelaar even physically assaulted young team mate [[Steve McManaman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2357669/Fight-club-when-team-mates-fall-out.html |title=Fight club: when team-mates fall out |publisher=Telegraph |date=4 April 2005 |accessdate=16 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ever-present until he was injured in the final minute of a 2–0 defeat at [[Leeds United]] on 19 February 1994. It turned out to be his final appearance for the club.

In 14 years at the club, he had won six league title medals, three FA Cup winner's medal, three Football League Cup winner's medals and a European Cup winner's medal.

===Southampton===
Grobbelaar left Liverpool in mid-1994, transferring on a free to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. He made his debut on 20 August 1994 in the 1–1 league draw with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at [[The Dell (Southampton F.C.)|The Dell]]. He spent two seasons with the Saints competing with another goalkeeper with a reputation for eccentricity, [[Dave Beasant]].&lt;ref name = "ITN521"&gt;{{Cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last= Holley |first= Duncan |last2= Chalk |first2=Gary | publisher=Hagiology Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=0-9534474-3-X|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the fuss caused by the match-fixing allegations (see below), manager [[Alan Ball (footballer)|Alan Ball]] maintained faith in him, and he kept his place in the team for most of the 1994–95 season.&lt;ref name = "ITN241"&gt;{{Cite book| title=In That Number |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year=  | isbn= |pages=236–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations that Grobbelar had been match-fixing first appeared in November 1994. Nevertheless, in his next game, at home to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], he managed to keep a clean sheet despite the media frenzy that surrounded the game.&lt;ref name = "ITN237"&gt;{{Cite book| title=In That Number |last= |first= | publisher=| year=| isbn=|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Southern Daily Echo]]'' reported that Grobbelaar was "swept along on a tidal wave of emotion, to emerge triumphant from the toughest match of his life".&lt;ref name = "ITN237"/&gt;

In the 1995–96 season, Grobbelaar only managed two games for the Saints, before moving on to [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].&lt;ref name = "ITN245"&gt;{{Cite book| title=In That Number |last= |first= | publisher=| year=| isbn=|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Southampton===
Grobbelaar spent the 1996–97 season with Plymouth, after which he spent short spells at [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], [[Chesham United F.C.|Chesham United]], [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] and [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] over the next 2 years before returning to his native country.

==International career==
Grobbelaar was born in [[Durban]], South Africa to ethnic [[Afrikaner]] parents. When he was two months old he emigrated to Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980) with his mother and sister to join his father, who had got a job on the railways there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcxCOafwajw|title=The Official Story of Bruce Grobbelaar|publisher=Youtube.com|date=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grobbelaar grew up and learnt his football in Rhodesia. He made his international debut for [[Rhodesia national football team|Rhodesia]] as a 19-year-old in a friendly versus [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/oldest-youngest.html#mlc |title=Oldest and youngest players and goal-scorers in international football |publisher=Rsssf.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grobbelaar played for Zimbabwe in both of their [[1982 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|1982 World Cup]] qualifying matches versus [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/zimbabwe-v-cameroon-16-november-1980-236236/|title=Zimbabwe v Cameroon, 16 November 1980|publisher=11v11.com|date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/cameroon-v-zimbabwe-12-october-1980-236196/|title=Cameroon v Zimbabwe, 12 October 1980|publisher=11v11.com|date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared for his country in a qualifying match for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|1986 World Cup]] versus [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/egypt-v-zimbabwe-28-august-1984-238645/|title=Egypt v Zimbabwe, 28 August 1984|publisher=11v11.com|date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ak/EgyptianSports/versusZIMBABWE.html#ZimbabweH84 |title=Egypt Versus Zimbabwe |publisher=www.angelfire.com/ak/EgyptianSports |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, he returned to the national team after an absence of several years. With a team including Grobbelaar and [[Adam Ndlovu|Adam]] and [[Peter Ndlovu]], Zimbabwe came just a victory short of qualification for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|1994 World Cup]] under the guidance of manager [[Reinhard Fabisch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/19/peter-ndlovu-bruce-grobbelaar-zimbabwe |title=When Peter Ndlovu and Bruce Grobbelaar made Zimbabwe dare to dream  |publisher=www.theguardian.com |date=19 August 2015|accessdate=26 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grobbelaar earned 32 caps for Zimbabwe between 1980 and 1998.

In 2018, Grobbelaar played a one off game for [[Matabeleland football team|Matabeleland]] in the [[2018 ConIFA World Football Cup |ConiFA World Cup]]. In it he came off injured after around 30 minutes.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Match-fixing allegations==
On 10 November 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ThhguC97EdA/SbAG_nNSCbI/AAAAAAAAAiw/L8k2YZDdyH4/s1600-h/I-SAVED.jpg |title=I-SAVED.jpg (image) |publisher=3.bp.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grobbelaar was accused by the British [[tabloid newspaper]] ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' of [[match fixing]] during his time at Liverpool to benefit a betting syndicate, after being caught on videotape discussing match-fixing. He was charged with [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to corrupt, along with the [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] goalkeeper [[Hans Segers]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] striker [[John Fashanu]] (only recently signed from Wimbledon), and a Malaysian businessman, [[Heng Suan Lim]].

Despite these allegations, Grobbelaar and Segers were allowed to continue playing, while Fashanu retired from playing less than a year after being charged. Grobbelaar [[plea]]ded [[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]], claiming he was only gathering evidence with the intent of taking it to the police. After two successive [[trial]]s, in both of which the [[jury]] could not agree on a [[verdict]], he and his co-defendants were cleared in November 1997. Grobbelaar later sued ''The Sun'' for [[libel]] and was awarded £85,000. ''The Sun'' appealed, and the case was eventually taken to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] where it was found that, though the specific allegations had not been proved, there was adequate evidence of dishonesty. The Lords slashed his award to £1, the lowest libel damages possible under English law, and ordered him to pay ''The Sun'''s [[costs (English law)|legal costs]], estimated at £500,000. In his judgement, [[Lord Bingham of Cornhill]] observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[tort]] of [[defamation]] protects those whose reputations have been unlawfully injured. It affords little or no protection to those who have, or deserve to have, no reputation deserving of legal protection. Until 9 November 1994 when the newspaper published its first articles about him, the appellant's public reputation was unblemished. But he had in fact acted in a way in which no decent or honest footballer would act and in a way which could, if not exposed and stamped on, undermine the integrity of a game which earns the loyalty and support of millions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldjudgmt/jd021024/grobb-1.htm |title=House of Lords - Grobbelaar (Appellant) v News Group Newspapers Ltd and Another (Respondents) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Grobbelaar was unable to pay the costs and was declared [[bankrupt]]. He and Segers did not retire from playing until some time after being cleared of their involvement in the alleged match fixing.

==Retirement and coaching==
Grobbelaar moved back to his home of origin South Africa where he coached a number of teams with various degrees of success.  He managed [[Seven Stars (South African Soccer Club)|Seven Stars]] in 1999 and took the team from the relegation zone to finish fourth in the final league table.  In 2001, he took over struggling [[Benoni Premier United|Hellenic]]. While at the club, he saved them from relegation, and played in their last match of the season, against Kaizer Chiefs, starting the game, and substituting himself after 20 minutes after cracking his ribs. He was the oldest player ever to have played in the South African league, at 44 years old, until his record was beaten in 2013 by fellow keeper Andre Arendse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickoff.com/news/34162/andrew-arendse-the-oldest-player-to-feature-in-south-african-psl- |title=Andrew Arendse the oldest player to feature in South African PSL - News |publisher=Kick Off |date=2013-05-02 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent time coaching [[Supersport United]],  [[Manning Rangers]] (2004) and [[Bush Bucks|Umtata Bush Bucks]] (2004), as well as in Zimbabwe, where he was twice briefly player-manager of [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe's national team]] in 1997 and 1998.

Grobbelaar came back to the United Kingdom briefly to help coach a number of clubs. Grobbelaar has recently {{When|date=September 2010}} stated that he "hopes to one day return to Anfield as the manager of Liverpool FC."

Grobbelaar returned to England in 2006 to play in a replay of the 1986 FA cup final against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for the Marina Dalglish Appeal, a charity for Cancer research set up by former team-mate and manager Kenny Dalglish and his wife, Marina, a cancer survivor. Liverpool won the match 1–0.

Grobbelaar played in the [[Sky One|Sky One's]] ''The Match'' in 2004 and ''The Match 3'' in 2006, keeping a clean sheet in both games.

Grobbelaar, also known as "Brucie", is still a firm favourite amongst the Anfield faithful, and was voted as No.17 in a poll [[100 Players Who Shook The Kop]] conducted in mid-2006 by the official Liverpool Football Club website. Over 110,000 worldwide voted for their best 10 players in the Anfield club's history, with Grobbelaar finishing 2nd in the goalkeeping stakes.

In March 2007, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool's]] official website announced that Grobbelaar would come out of retirement for a one-off game and play for non-league [[Castleford]] side [[Glasshoughton Welfare F.C.|Glasshoughton Welfare]] to help them in their fight for survival.  He played against [[Maltby Main F.C.|Maltby Main]] on 14 April 2007, helping Glasshoughton to a 2–1 win.&lt;ref name = "DM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-League side want Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar for Gloucestershire Cup assault |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1228670/Non-League-want-Liverpool-legend-Bruce-Grobbelaar-Gloucestershire-Cup-assault.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=9 September 2010|location=London|date=17  November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Jim |title=Grobbelaar saves day for struggling minnows|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/jimwhite/2310988/Grobbelaar-saves-day-for-struggling-minnows.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=9 September 2010|location=London|date=14 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2009 episode of ITV's ''[[Hell's Kitchen (UK)#Series 4|Hell's Kitchen]]'' Grobbelaar wore a black armband on his left arm in remembrance of the 20th Anniversary of the [[Hillsborough disaster]]. On 22 April, he left the show citing a need to be reunited with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| date=22 April 2009| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8013699.stm | title=Grobbelaar quits Hell's Kitchen | publisher=BBC | accessdate=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was persuaded to play for [[Winterbourne United F.C.|Winterbourne United]] in their [[Gloucestershire FA]] Trophy game against Patchway Town on 5 December 2009 but in the end did not make an appearance. Winterbourne at that time were managed by [[Nick Tanner (footballer)|Nicky Tanner]], who was a team mate of Grobbelaar at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grobbelaar says yes to Winterbourne|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/sport/Grobbelaar-says-yes-Winterbourne/article-1525997-detail/article.html|publisher=Bristol Evening Post|accessdate=9 September 2010|date=18 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121030147/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/sport/Grobbelaar-says-yes-Winterbourne/article-1525997-detail/article.html#|archive-date=21 November 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2010 in South Africa]] he appeared on Norwegian TV-channel [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]].

Grobbelaar currently resides in [[Corner Brook]], Newfoundland, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/Canada/NL/Audio/ID/2280972196/ |title=Bruce Grobbelaar - Hillsborough Tragedy - West Coast Morning - CBC Player |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grobbelaar is active in the local soccer scene, playing keeper for Corner Brook Men's Soccer League team West Side Monarchs, and occasionally lending his expertise to the Corner Brook Minor Soccer Association as a coach.

In May 2018 he became goalkeeping coach for the [[Matabeleland football team]], and on June 1 it was announced that he would join the playing roster for their remaining group games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newsday.co.zw/2018/06/grobbelaar-back-between-goalposts/ Grobbelaar back between goalposts] Newsday.co.zw&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently announced by head coach Justin Walley that he would start in goal against [[Chagos Islands national football team|Chagos Islands]] on 7 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/JustinWalley10/status/1004322105184391168 Justin Walley on Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Baseball pick-off attempt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[first baseman]] (standing in white) '''covering''' first base during a [[pickoff]] attempt.]]
In [[baseball]], part of the [[infielder]]s' and pitcher's jobs is to '''cover bases'''.  That is, they stand next to a [[baseball field|base]] in anticipation of receiving the ball thrown from another fielder, so that they may make a play on an opposing [[baserunner]] who is approaching that base.  On a [[force play]], the fielder covering the base stands with one foot on that base.

In general, the [[first baseman]] covers first base, the [[second baseman]] or [[shortstop]] covers second, the [[third baseman]] covers third, and the [[catcher]] covers [[home plate]].  However, on [[ground ball]]s hit to the first baseman away from first base, the [[pitcher]] will cover first base instead. On a ground ball to either the shortstop or the second baseman, the other of those will cover second base.

With a runner on first base, when a ground ball is hit to the third baseman, second base will be covered by the second baseman, because unlike the shortstop he does not have to turn his back to the third baseman in order to get to second base. Likewise, with a runner on first base, when a ground ball is hit to the first baseman, second base will be covered by the shortstop, who unlike the second baseman does not have to turn his back toward the first baseman in order to get to second base.

When a runner on first base attempts to [[stolen base|steal second base]], the shortstop and second baseman will have arranged in advance which one will cover second base to receive the ball from the catcher. Likewise, when the pitcher attempts to [[pick off]] a runner at second base, the shortstop and second baseman will have arranged in advance which one will cover second base.

With [[baserunner]]s on first and second bases, sometimes the shortstop will cover third base on a [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]], a coverage plan known as the "rotation play" or "wheelplay." This occurs if the batter bunts the ball toward third base so that the third baseman cannot cover third base because he is moving forward to field the ball.

If the defense is employing an extreme [[shift (baseball)|shift]], with the shortstop playing on the first-base side of second base and with the third baseman playing near second base (because by reputation the batter is anticipated to hit the ball to the right side of the infield), in some cases the pitcher may need to cover third base.

When the pitcher throws a [[wild pitch]], or when the catcher permits a [[passed ball]], so that in either case the catcher has to retreat farther into [[foul territory]] away from home plate to retrieve the ball, if there is a runner on third base the pitcher will cover home plate.

Depending on the situation, however, various fielders can cover any base, and sometimes even an [[outfielder]] can cover a base.

In [[American English]], the expression "cover your bases" used outside of a baseball setting means to be thoroughly prepared for something.

'''''Daley Thompson's Decathlon''''' is a [[personal computer game|computer game]] developed and released under licence by [[Ocean Software]] in 1984.&lt;ref name='SU32'&gt;{{cite news | first=Chris | last=Bourne | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Daley takes the gold | date=November 1984 | publisher=[[EMAP]] | url =http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/032/ssftwre.htm | work =[[Sinclair User]] | pages = | accessdate =6 January 2009 | language = |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010223023123/http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/032/ssftwre.htm|archivedate=2001-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in the wake of [[Daley Thompson|Daley Thompson's]] popularity following his gold medals in the [[decathlon]] at the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]]. A sequel, ''Daley Thompson's Super-Test'', was released in 1985.

==Gameplay==
The player takes part in the ten events of the modern decathlon:

*Day 1: [[100 metres]], [[long jump]], [[shot put]], [[high jump]], and [[400 metres]]
*Day 2: [[110 metre hurdles|110 hurdles]], [[pole vault]], [[Discus throw|discus]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], and [[1500 metres]]

The player starts the game with three lives; failure to reach the minimum standard in an event results in the loss of one life.  Success in the 1500 meters event results in the game returning to Day 1 to repeat the events with more difficult qualification criteria.

Depending on the computer, running is simulated by hitting two keys (representing the left and right leg) alternately and as quickly as possible or by moving the joystick from side to side as quickly as possible.  The game rapidly gained a reputation among players as a "joystick killer" because of the constant vigorous waggling of the joystick required during many of the events.

The Spectrum version was the first game to use [[Speedlock]], a fast loader on the computer.&lt;ref name="crash"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/44/david_aj.htm|last=Eddy|first=Richard|year=1987|publisher=Crash|issue=44|title=The One David|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The soundtrack of the C64 version of the game was composed by [[Martin Galway]] and [[David Dunn (disambiguation)|David Dunn]].  The introduction music is based on the 1978 [[electronic music]] piece "[[Solid State Survivor|Rydeen]]" by [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (YMO).

==Reception==
''[[Sinclair User]]'' gave the game a score of 8/10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue032/Pages/SinclairUser03200026.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;  It went on to become the biggest selling Spectrum game of Q4 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue037/Pages/CVG03700104.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;  The game won the award for Best (Overall) Arcade Game in ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' magazine's Readers Awards 1984&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crashonline.org.uk/12/awards.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Crash Readers Awards 1984 |url=https://archive.org/stream/crash-magazine-12/Crash_12_Jan_1985#page/n95/mode/2up |magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |issue=12 |page=96 |location=Ludlow, Shropshire |publisher=Newsfield Ltd. |date=Christmas 1984&lt;!-- cover says 1984/85 --&gt; |access-date=2016-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the Best Arcade-Style Game of the Year at the [[Golden Joystick Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue044/Pages/CVG04400122.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was included on the 1985 compilation ''They Sold a Million'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0011371&lt;/ref&gt; along with ''[[Beach-Head]]'', ''[[Sabre Wulf]]'', and ''[[Jet Set Willy]]''. In 2017, the game placed on [[Eurogamer]]'s "10 games that defined the ZX Spectrum" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mason|first1=Graeme|title=10 games that defined the ZX Spectrum|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-09-10-games-that-defined-the-zx-spectrum|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=10 April 2017|date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2195">'''Dead rubber''' is a term used in [[sport]]ing parlance to describe a [[game|match]] in a [[playoff format|series]] where the series result has already been decided by earlier matches. The dead rubber match therefore has no effect on the winner and loser of the series, other than the total number of matches won and lost.

The term is used in [[Davis Cup]] and [[Fed Cup]] [[tennis]], as well as in international [[cricket]], [[field hockey]], the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[Rugby World Cup]].

For example, in a Davis Cup series, each pair of competing countries play five matches (''rubbers'') where the winner is decided on a best-of-five basis. Once one team has reached three victories, the remaining match or matches are said to be ''dead rubbers''. [[International Tennis Federation]]'s last revision of the competition policies on dead rubbers is from 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/news/articles/itf-revises-davis-cup-dead-rubber-policy.aspx|title=ITF revises Davis Cup dead rubber policy|date=March 2, 2011|publisher=Davis Cup|accessdate=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the result of a dead rubber has no impact in determining the winner of a series, dead rubbers are typically played in a less intense atmosphere, often allowing the team that has lost the series to obtain a match win. Sometimes, second-string players who have not played many matches in top-level competition are given the opportunity to play a dead rubber in order to gain experience. This practice makes completing a clean sweep of a series less likely.

'''El-Entag El-Harby Sporting Club''' ({{lang-ar|'''نادي الانتاج الحربي الرياضي'''}} ; {{lang-en|''' Military Production'''}}) is a [[Cairo]]-based [[Association football|football]] club in the [[Egyptian Premier League]], representing the Ministry of War Production. Its promotion to the Premier League for the [[Egyptian Premier League 2009–10|2009–10 season]] marked its first appearance at that level.

==History==
In 2004 The Club Played For Youth At This Year They Managed Under Mohamed Abdel-all Who Managed Unknown Club In UAE Afer Entag Harby And The Top Players At This Moment Is Abdelrahman Mohamed And Amr Mohamed.{{clarify|reason=The previous sentence makes no sense in English.|date=November 2015}}
After a long and an intense race with [[Al Nasr Egypt|Al Nasr]] and El Dakhleya in [[2008-09 Egyptian Second Division|2008–09]], El-Entag El-Harby secured its first appearance ever in the [[Egyptian Premier League]]. The team needed their last match that season (2–2 tie with GASCO) to win promotion. In preparation for its premier league campaign, El-Entag El-Harby appointed [[Tarek Yehia]] as the new manager. Yehia quickly looked for the option of signing experienced Egyptian players that could lead the team to prevent relegation. He signed players such as [[Mohamed Aboul Ela]] ([[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]] former captain), [[Mostafa Kamal (footballer born 1973)|Mostafa Kamal]] (Veteran Goal Keeper), Hassan Mousa, and others.

Tarek Yehia enjoyed great success with his team. Surprisingly, El-Entag El-Harby finished 7th in its first season at the Premier League level ([[2009–10 Egyptian Premier League|2009–10]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/egy2010.html "Egypt 2009/10"]. RSSF. Retrieved on 9 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Yehia's era at the club lasted for only that season. He preferred to move to newly promoted [[Misr Lel Makasa]]. [[Osama Orabi]] replaced him.&lt;ref&gt;Tarek, Sherif [http://filgoal.com/English/News.aspx?NewsID=68818 "Production install Orabi as new boss"]. Filgoal, 2010-06-06.

'''''He Got Game''''' is a 1998 American [[List of sports films|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, produced and directed by [[Spike Lee]] and starring [[Denzel Washington]]. This is the third of four film collaborations between Washington and Lee.

Washington portrays Jake Shuttlesworth, father of the top-ranked [[basketball]] prospect in the country, Jesus Shuttlesworth, played by [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star [[Ray Allen]]. Jake, in prison for killing his wife, is released on [[parole]] for a week by the state's governor to persuade his son to play for the governor's [[alma mater]] in exchange for a much reduced prison sentence.

== Plot ==
Jesus Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen), the top high school basketball player in the United States, is being pursued by the top college basketball programs in the nation. His father, Jake, is a convicted felon serving time at [[Attica Correctional Facility]] for accidentally killing his wife, Martha, ([[Jesus (name)|Jesus]]' mother) six years earlier.  Jake is temporarily released by the governor, an influential alumnus of "Big State," one of the colleges Jesus is considering, so that he might persuade his son to sign with the governor's college. If successful, he'll get an early release from prison.

While seemingly a sound plan, it turns haywire due to the strained relationship between Jesus (who resents his father for killing his mother) and Jake. Upon his first moments outside of prison, Jake contacts his daughter, Mary Shuttlesworth ([[Zelda Harris]]), who is happy to see him. Mary invites her father to the apartment where she and Jesus now live, having moved out of their Uncle Bubba's place. When Jesus returns home from school, he is unhappy to see his father. Refusing to look him in the eye, he tells his sister to get rid of the "stranger" in their living room. Jesus later agrees to meet with his father at an alternative location away from Mary. Throughout the movie, Jake tries to persuade Jesus to attend "Big State" with seemingly no success. Eventually, he divulges the deal set up by the governor. However, Jesus appears unsympathetic to his father's situation. 

Flashbacks illustrate the younger Jesus' gruelling basketball training under his father, and the night an argument between Jake and Jesus escalated into violence, resulting in Jake accidentally killing Jake's mother after she intervened. Jake reveals to Jesus the origin of the first name which embarrassed Jesus in childhood: Jake tells his son he named him not after [[Jesus Christ]] but after basketball player [[Earl Monroe]], who had the nicknames "Jesus" (which the white media changed to "Black Jesus").

Intertwined with the story of the Shuttlesworth family is the sub-plot of Dakota Barns ([[Milla Jovovich]]), a prostitute who stays in the room next to Jake in the run-down hotel, which the warden has booked for him. Dakota is being abused by her procurer and companion, Sweetness. Jake overhears the violence through the thin walls. Throughout the film, Jake is seen helping clean Dakota's wounds, and Jake gives Dakota some of his money to be used for his expenses during his week out of prison. He also develops a romantic relationship with her. Dakota is seen in one of the final scenes of the movie taking a Greyhound bus away from [[New York City]].

Jesus is tempted with offers of cash and women on recruiting visits to big time basketball programs.  He also considers declaring the [[NBA]] in order to play professionally sooner and immediately lift himself and his sister out of poverty. Jake finally challenges Jesus to a game of one-on-one basketball, the winner being the first player to score 11. If Jake wins, Jesus will sign a letter of intent to play for "Big State" and if Jesus wins, he can make his own decision. After a competitive start, Jake tires during the course of the game and Jake wins, 11-5. Jake gives the letter of intent to his son, who casts it to the ground. AS Jake is collected for transportation back to Attica, he turns to Jesus and says, "Let me tell you something, son: You get that hatred out your heart, or you'll end up just another nigger...like your father."

Ultimately, Jesus decides to sign to play for "Big State." However, the governor does not give Jake the promised reduction, and Jake's work-release is fabricated in the media as an escape from prison before being recaptured.  Jake ultimately finds freedom by casting away his dreams and burdens to his son, Jesus, symbolized by the throwing of his old basketball over the prison wall and magically onto the Big State court where Jesus is practicing alone.  Jesus clutches the ball, knowing it is a message of hope from his father.

==Production==
Filming took place between July and September 1997. Locations included [[Coney Island, Brooklyn]], [[Cabrini&amp;ndash;Green|Cabrini&amp;ndash;Green housing projects]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Elon University]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], and [[Los Angeles, California]].

For the role of Jesus, Lee had drawn up a list of every NBA player who could pass for a high school senior. [[Kobe Bryant]] was the original choice to portray Jesus Shuttlesworth, but after shooting several air balls that resulted in a brutal playoff loss to the Utah Jazz in the [[1997 NBA Playoffs]], he planned an extensive workout plan that would help maintain his strength throughout the duration of the longer NBA seasons. Lee found [[Tracy McGrady]] too reserved and was not impressed by [[Allen Iverson]]'s performance. Management for [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Stephon Marbury]] wanted a guarantee that one or the other would be offered the part. [[Travis Best]], [[Walter McCarty]], and [[Rick Fox]] also auditioned, and Lee cast them in supporting roles.  Lee approached Allen during halftime of a Bucks-[[New York Knicks|Knicks]] game, ultimately offering him the role of Jesus. Allen had never acted before, and he trained with an acting coach for eight weeks prior to filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thisdistractedglobe.com/2008/05/12/he-got-game-1998-2/ |title=He Got Game (1998) |publisher=Thisdistractedglobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBA players [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Reggie Miller]], [[Bill Walton]], [[Scottie Pippen]], [[Michael Jordan]], and [[Charles Barkley]], [[Syracuse University]] coach [[Jim Boeheim]], NBA coaches [[Rick Pitino]] and [[George Karl]] and broadcaster [[Dick Vitale]] made cameo appearances at one point early in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGW-36kQzNo |title=Jesus Shuttlesworth |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227185927/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGW-36kQzNo |archivedate=February 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Former football legend [[Jim Brown]] also appears as one of Jake's parole officers, assigned to keep tabs on him while he's away from the prison.

==Release==

===Box office===
''He Got Game'' was produced on an estimated $25 million budget.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In the opening weekend of its release, it was shown on 1,319 screens, and took in $7,610,663 at the U.S. box offices debuting at #1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1998&amp;wknd=18&amp;p=.htm Weekend Box Office Results for May 1-3, 1998 - Box Office Mojo]&lt;/ref&gt; It eventually grossed a total of $21,554,585.00, which was a box office flop considering it fell short of its $25 million budget.

===Critical response===
Response to the film was largely favorable, with review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] showing it receiving 80% favorable reviews, praising Lee's artfulness, commentary, and honest connection to human characters. Negative reviews focused their criticism on the film's length and Lee's overindulgence, with ''[[Time Out London]]'' writing, "Most scenes play too long, with a surplus of ideas, textures, tones and characters, and after 134 minutes it's clear Lee's problem with closure hasn't gone away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/dvd/98441.html |title=He Got Game Review.

He was particularly encouraged by Lee's determination not to adhere to typical conventions.&lt;ref name="suntimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980501/REVIEWS/805010304/1023 |title=He Got Game :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Ray Allen and Washington drew praise for their performances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117477426.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;query=he+got+game |title=He Got Game Review - Read Variety's Analysis Of The Movie He Got Game |publisher=Variety.com |date= 1998-04-27|accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Roger Ebert writing that Allen "is that rarity, an athlete who can act," and ''Slate'' magazine writing that Washington's performance was "gorgeously underplayed".&lt;ref name="suntimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Edelstein |first=David |url=http://slate.msn.com/id/3252 |title=He Got Balls - By David Edelstein - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.msn.com |date=1998-05-03 |accessdate=2010-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125225131/http://slate.msn.com/id/3252 |archivedate=2009-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPN's review pointed out factual flaws in the story: "...coaches aren't allowed to discuss potential recruits until after the signing period. Come on, Spike. (And while we're at it, players aren't allowed to visit a college one week before the signing deadline; Jesus couldn't live alone with his sister without both of them being thrown in a foster home; and there's NO WAY IN HELL that Jesus wouldn't have just turned pro if he was that good and that broke.)" &lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/movies/hegotgame Simmons, 'Review - He Got Game'], ESPN sports&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{further|He Got Game (soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack for ''He Got Game'' was composed of numerous orchestral pieces by [[Aaron Copland]] with songs created by [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. It was released by [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] on April 21, 1998.

The '''Hindmarsh Stadium''' (currently known as the '''Coopers Stadium''' due to sponsorship from the Adelaide-based [[Coopers Brewery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.coopers.com.au/about-us/news.aspx#Coopers_Wins_Naming_Rights_To_Hindmarsh_Stadium|title=Coopers Wins Naming Rights To Hindmarsh Stadium|publisher=''[[Coopers Brewery]]''|date=1 July 2013|accessdate=1 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203232959/http://www.coopers.com.au/about-us/news.aspx/#Coopers_Wins_Naming_Rights_To_Hindmarsh_Stadium|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Hindmarsh, South Australia|Hindmarsh]], an inner western suburb of [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. It is the home of the Australian [[A-League]] team, [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]].

The stadium has a capacity of 16,500,&lt;ref name="austadiums1"/&gt; of which 15,000 is seated. Home team [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]] regularly fill this capacity, and averaged crowds of over 12,000 to its matches during the [[A-League 2006-07|2006-07 Season]] and [[A-League 2007-08|2007-08 Season]]. United used the stadium for its home matches in the [[AFC Champions League 2008|2008 AFC Asian Champions League]], the [[AFC Champions League 2010|2010 AFC Asian Champions League]], and the [[AFC Champions League 2012|2012 AFC Asian Champions League]].

==History==
Built in 1960, the stadium stands on the site that was once Hindmarsh Oval which housed the [[West Torrens Football Club]] of the [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] from 1905 until 1921, when the team moved to nearby [[Thebarton Oval]] which would remain its home until 1989. During World War I the Patriotic Football League, a group of SANFL clubs that wanted to continue playing football during the war played many games at the venue. The 1916 Patriotic Football League Grand Final was held at the ground between {{AFL Por}} and {{SANFL WT}} with Port Adelaide winning 7.11 (53) to 1.13 (19).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59827704 |title=FOOTBALL. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)]] |volume=5, |issue=222 |location=South Australia |date=19 August 1916 |accessdate=23 January 2017 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Football Federation of South Australia|Soccer Association of South Australia]] owned land on a former brick pit on [[Torrens Road, Adelaide|Torrens Road]] at [[Brompton, South Australia|Brompton]] named Rowley Park which was located only 5&amp;nbsp;km from the [[City of Adelaide|city]], and the original plan was for the land to be the home of Soccer in SA as the site formed a natural bowl. However, the Soccer Association had received negative press regarding its failure to grow grass on the site. Rowley Park also had a tendency to flood during winter as the bottom of "The Brick Pit" was below the level of the [[water table]] which made playing soccer virtually impossible. The land was eventually leased to a group of [[Dirt track racing|speedway]] drivers and would become the famous [[Rowley Park Speedway]] which ran from December 1949 until it closed in April 1979. The land was eventually sold and is now the Kym Bonython housing estate, named for the speedway's long time promoter [[Kym Bonython]].

When it became obvious to the Soccer Association that Rowley Park would be unsuitable as a soccer venue they obtained a lease on Hindmarsh Oval from the Hindmarsh Council. The old Hindmarsh Oval was developed over the years into a rectangular stadium capable of holding 15,000 with a single tier grandstand built in 1960 that held approximately 2,000 while 6 light towers for night games (plus another 8 smaller light towers on the grandstand roof) were installed during the mid-1970s. Other than the grandstand, the ground was all terracing surrounding the playing surface. This changed in 1996 when seats were installed on the eastern side of the ground.

Along with the [[Kensington Oval, Adelaide|Olympic Sports Field]], Hindmarsh became one of two Adelaide venues in the then new but now-defunct [[National Soccer League]] in [[1977 National Soccer League|1977]]. Hindmarsh was the home ground of the [[Adelaide City|Adelaide City Zebras]] (who also played games at the Sports Field), and later the home ground for [[West Adelaide SC|West Adelaide Hellas]]. Hindmarsh would eventually become the sole Adelaide NSL venue during the late 1980s.

In 1986 Hindmarsh stadium hosted the first leg of the NSL Grand Final between Adelaide City and [[Sydney Olympic Football Club|Sydney Olympic]]. Unfortunately for Adelaide fans Olympic won 1-0. Adelaide would go on to win the 2nd leg in Sydney 3-1 and become NSL Champions. Hindmarsh again hosted the NSL Grand Final (this time a single game) in 1994-95 when Adelaide City faced the [[Mark Viduka]] led [[Melbourne Knights FC|Melbourne Knights]]. In front of a packed house of over 16,000 the Knights defeated the Zebras 2-0.

As soccer was generally played to smaller crowds during the 1970s and 80's, Hindmarsh became a regular host of the [[Socceroos]] in some of their international matches, with Adelaide-based players such as [[Robert Zabica]], [[Alex Tobin]], and the Vidmar brothers [[Aurelio Vidmar|Aurelio]] and [[Tony Vidmar|Tony]] all playing prominent roles.

Hindmarsh Stadium not only hosted soccer matches but also hosted [[Rugby Union]] and [[Rugby League]]. In 1992 the [[New Zealand All Blacks]] played an exhibition game against a [[South Australia Rugby Union|South Australian 'Select']] team which included former [[Australian Wallabies|Wallabies]] [[Lock (rugby union)|Lock]] and current day author/media personality [[Peter FitzSimons]]. The All Blacks, including goal kicking [[Stand-off (rugby union)|Stand-off]] [[Grant Fox]] who would retire the following year as the All Blacks highest ever point scorer, ran out easy winners while FitzSimons, playing up to the crowd by humorously claiming innocence, was sent off midway through the second half after numerous infringements. At the time this made FitzSimons the only Wallaby (although his international career had finished by the time of the match) to ever be sent off in a match against the All Blacks.

In 1996 as part of the rebuilding of the venue before the [[2000 Summer Olympic Games]], the original single tier grandstand with its wooden bench seats was demolished and replaced by the current two tier structure. The terracing on the opposite wing was also removed and replaced by seating. When the ground was rebuilt before the Olympics only the new grandstand would remain in place.

[[File:Hindmarsh Stadium 6.jpg|thumb|[[National Rugby League]] match between the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]] and [[North Queensland Cowboys]] at Hindmarsh Stadium on 19 April 2009]]
In 1998 the short lived [[National Rugby League]] team the [[Adelaide Rams]] used Hindmarsh for their last 4 home games of the [[1998 NRL season]]. The Rams début at the venue was a success when they thumped the [[Balmain Tigers]] 52-0 in front of 7,351 fans. The Rams would end up 2-2 at Hindmarsh after defeating the [[Auckland Warriors]], but losing to [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]] and [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]]. The Rams were to continue using Hindmarsh as their home ground in the [[1999 NRL season]] giving them a rectangular venue suited to league rather than an oval as was their previous home, the [[Adelaide Oval]]. However the team was wound up by owners [[News Limited|News Ltd]] only weeks before the start of the 1999 season.

Hindmarsh Stadium was one of the venues chosen to host preliminary matches for the [[Football at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|men's soccer]] during the 2000 Olympics held in [[Sydney]]. This saw the stadium receive almost a complete rebuild which brought it to its present status. The field was lengthened from 110 to 120 metres to be able to also accommodate both rugby league and rugby union which used longer field dimensions (though the minimum field length of a union field including in-goal areas is actually 120 metres so shorter than desirable in-goals are required), the six old light towers were replaced with four television standard ones (one in each corner with lights also on the front edge of the grandstand roof) and the former terracing was now all seated, uncovered stands with only the grandstand built in the mid-1990s remaining in place. During the Olympics, temporary stands were erected in the corners of the stadium to bring capacity up to 20,000. Hosting matches from Groups A and B, the recorded attendance at Hindmarsh was set at 18,340 when [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy]] drew 1-1 [[Nigeria national under-23 football team|Nigeria]] on 19 September 2000.

Other [[soccer]] played in the stadium in the past include several international matches, including most of the games played in the [[2004 OFC Nations Cup]] - an event where the Socceroos began their qualifying campaign for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. In 2007 the venue hosted the first two rounds of the [[Australia national under-23 football team|Olyroos]] campaign as they qualified for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. With the rise in the sports popularity in Australia, Hindmarsh is rarely used these days by the Socceroos other than for training purposes or matches against lower ranked countries such as those from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] islands. International matches now generally take place at larger capacity venues such as [[Sydney]]'s 84,000 seat [[ANZ Stadium]], [[Brisbane]]'s 52,500 seat [[Suncorp Stadium]], or the largest stadium in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the 100,024 capacity [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. Though with the redevelopment of the [[Adelaide Oval]] to a world class, [[FIFA]] compliant 53,583 capacity stadium (50,083 seated), there is renewed speculation that the Socceroos will return to Adelaide for high-profile international matches.

On 15 April 2006 on a Saturday night the stadium hosted its first NRL match since the Rams final home game in 1998 when the Sydney-based [[Penrith Panthers]] played that year's NRL Grand Finalist the [[Melbourne Storm]]. With 7,017 fans in attendance the Storm ran out easy 40-18 winners with emerging rugby league superstar [[Greg Inglis]] scoring 3 tries for Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/scorers/games/2006/200604151927.html Penrith v Melbourne stats] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204064320/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/scorers/games/2006/200604151927.html |date=4 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a home match for the Panthers who brought the game to Adelaide due to renovations being completed at their usual home, [[Penrith Park]] in western Sydney.

The Stadium's Record attendance outside of the 2000 Olympic Games is 17,000 at the [[AFC Champions League 2008|2008 AFC Champions League]] [[AFC Champions League 2008#Final|Final Second leg]] between Adelaide United and [[Gamba Osaka]] of [[Japan]]. Adelaide lost 2-0, but still became tournament runners up. This remains Adelaide United's record attendance at Hindmarsh.
On 3 October 2008 it was announced by the SA Government Minister for Recreation and Sport [[Michael Wright (Australian politician)|Michael Wright]] coach [[Ricky Stuart]], head coach of Sydney-based NRL team the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]], that the Sharks would play three NRL home games at Hindmarsh over 3 years starting from 2009.  The first of those was against the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] on 19 April 2009. On a sunny autumn day the Cowboys defeated the Sharks 34-10 in front of 8,547 fans, the record crowd for a rugby league match at Hindmarsh.

Unfortunately for NRL fans in Adelaide it was announced early in the [[2010 NRL season|2010 season]] that Cronulla had been allowed by the SA Government to pull out of their contract. Cronulla's official reasons were wanting to concentrate on their home fans by not taking home games away from [[Endeavour Field|Toyota Stadium]]. The NRL return to Adelaide in [[2010 NRL season|2010]] when another Sydney based club [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] played a home game at the [[Adelaide Oval]] instead of Hindmarsh against the Melbourne Storm. The Bulldogs had planned to make the Adelaide Oval their 'other' home, returning in [[2011 NRL season|2011]], again against the Storm, but this was also abandoned after just two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/adelaide-left-to-bulldogs/story-e6frep5x-1225793112166 Adelaide left to Bulldogs | Courier Mail&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue took host to the inaugural [[2014 FFA Cup Final|FFA cup final]] on 16 December 2014 which saw [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]] face [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adelaideunited.com.au/news/adelaide-triumph-inaugural-cup-final|title=Adelaide triumph in inaugural Cup Final|website=Adelaide United|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; United were 1-0 victors with an attendance of 16,142.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Dialog Telekom]] (2008/2009, 2007/2008, 2006/2007, ...), [[CEAT Limited|CEAT]] tires (2009/2010), Unique apparels (2010/2011) are some of the past sponsors of the tournament. Number of participating teams were 12 in 2008/2009 and 2009/2010. Only 8 teams  participated in 2006/2007 while the 2010/2011 tournament consist of 14 teams and the 2012/2013 Season consisted of 15 teams.

[[File:Игра_в_лапту.jpg|right|thumb|A lapta game being played in 2014]]
[[File:Игра в лапту в России.jpg|thumb|An illustration of a group of men playing Lapta (circa 16th Century).]]
'''Lapta''' ({{lang-ru|лапта́}}) is a [[Russia]]n [[bat and ball games|bat and ball game]] first known to be played in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Baseball in Europe: a country by country history |last=Chetwynd |first=Josh |year=2008 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn= 9780786437245 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USi7PA151vIC&amp;pg=PA133 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentions of lapta have been found in medieval manuscripts, and balls and bats were found in the 14th-century layers during excavations in [[Novgorod]]. It is similar to [[cricket]], [[brännboll]], [[Rounders]], [[baseball]], [[oină]], [[:it:Tsan]] (Italy)  and [[pesäpallo]].

==Rules==
The game is played outside on a field the size of half a [[football pitch]]&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite book |title=Baseball in Europe: a country by country history |last=Chetwynd |first=Josh |year=2008 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn= 9780786437245 |page=313 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USi7PA151vIC&amp;pg=PA133 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20 x 25 [[sazhen]]s ({{convert|140|ft|m}} x {{convert|175|ft|m}}). There are 5 people on the field from the defending team, as well as pitcher/server.&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt; This pitcher server stands near the batter of the opposing team and hits a ball in the direction of the batter.&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt; The team that bats contains six people.&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt; Each hitter gets 2 chances to hit the ball over a 10m line.&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt; If they succeed at that, the runners can go to an endline at the other end of the pitch.&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt; If a player manages to run between the two endpoints, they get 2 points.&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt; A game lasts an hour, split into two equal halves.&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt;

The edges of the field were marked with parallel lines, called ''salo''.

The goal of the game is to hit the ball, served by a player of the opposite team, with the bat and send the ball as far as possible, then run across the field to the ''kon'' line, and if possible to run back to the ''gorod'' line.

The running player should try to avoid being hit with the ball, which is thrown by the opposing team members. For successful runs, the team earns points. A team wins by either getting more points during the scheduled time or by having all its players complete runs.

A description of lapta is given by [[Aleksandr Kuprin]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;This folk game is one of the most interesting and useful games. Lapta requires resourcefulness, deep breathing, faithfulness to your group, attention, dexterity, fast running, good aiming and marksmanship, strong striking hands, and firm eternal confidence that you cannot be defeated. The lazy and cowardly have no place in this game.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is competed for by senior teams from the [[North of Scotland]] district. It is one of the five trophies considered to be part of the [[Grand Slam (shinty)|Grand Slam]] in the sport of shinty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/shinty-irrepressible-ross-scores-four-as-kingussie-clinch-macaulay-cup-1-822227 |title=Shinty: Irrepressible Ross scores four as Kingussie clinch Macaulay Cup |first=Kenneth |last=Steven |work=The Scotsman |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current holders are Newtonmore.

[[File:MacTavish Cup 2014.JPG|thumb|The MacTavish Cup, lifted by Lovat in 2014]]

==History==
The trophy is a rose bowl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garthbeg.com/forum/showthread.php?t%3D16 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829004052/http://www.garthbeg.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16 |archivedate=2016-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented by Duncan MacTavish of [[Stratherrick]] in 1898 and the first competition was played that year and was won by [[Skye Camanachd]].

The final was televised for the first time in 2009 by BBC Alba.  The 2009 winners were [[Newtonmore Camanachd Club|Newtonmore Camanachd]], managed by [[Norman MacArthur]].

As of 2010, the opening rounds of the cup were to be played midweek, in order to reduce the backlog of fixtures that has regularly afflicted shinty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyecamanachd.com/default.aspx.locid-087new1e7.Lang-EN.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  This caused major controversy and [[Skye Camanachd]] sent an official letter of complaint to the Camanachd Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1553579?UserKey=]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this decision was reversed and midweek fixtures were reserved for junior level cups.

The 2010 final was played between Kingussie and Kilmallie, who upset Fort William to reach the final. The game was a magnificent advert for shinty and was won 5-4 by Kingussie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/8749618.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; It was broadcast live on [[BBC 2 Scotland]].

In 2014, the MacTavish Plate was established for teams losing in the first round. Fort William triumphed 2-1 over [[Skye Camanachd]] in the first final at Craigard, Invergarry. 

Only 5 clubs have managed to retain the trophy. Newtonmore being the most recent in 2016 and 2017, however Kingussie and Newtonmore have both done it multiple times both dominating for long periods. Fort Augustus and Inverness have both also successfully defended the trophy both doing so before The Great War.

Glenurquhart won the cup in 2015, defeating Newtonmore. This was notable not only for being their first victory in the competition but having lost the previous two finals to Lovat, as well as the 2008 final to Kingussie.

The 2018 final saw Newtonmore comeback from a goal down to defeat 2017 Premiership League champions Kinlochshiel 2-1 in a closely fought encounter at the Bught Park, Inverness. The match was shown live on BBC Alba.

The '''Major Taylor Velodrome''' is an open-air [[velodrome]] in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, U.S., named for 1899 cycling world champion [[Marshall Taylor]]. The {{convert|333.34|m|yd|abbr=on}} track with 28 degree banked turns and 9 degree straights. The Velodrome is located immediately north from [[Marian University (Indiana)|Marian University]] campus and is the home track of the 41-time USA Cycling National Champion Marian University Cycling Team.

The velodrome was opened in July 1982 for the [[U.S. Olympic Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gray| first=Ralph D.| title =IUPUI—the Making of an Urban University | publisher =[[Indiana University Press]]| year =2003 | location =Bloomington, Indiana | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yOnNSoCtD5YC | isbn =978-0-253-34242-3 | page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built at a cost of 2.5 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur L. Johnston (1995). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3GHqgKN4cEsC Minor League Baseball and Local Economic Development]''. University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|0-252-06502-6}}. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a facility required to host that year's [[U.S. Olympic Festival|National Sports Festival]], with money coming from a partnership between the Indianapolis Parks and Recreation Department and the [[Lilly Endowment]]. It was the first building built with public money in Indianapolis to be named after an African American. The proposal to name the facility for Taylor came initially from Tom Healy, a writer for the ''[[Indianapolis News]]'', who contacted Taylor's daughter, Sidney Taylor Brown. The two advocated among the city's business community and Mayor [[William H. Hudnut III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/DPR/Parks/SportsComplexes/Pages/About%20the%20Major%20Taylor%20Velodrome.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223711/http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/DPR/Parks/SportsComplexes/Pages/About%20the%20Major%20Taylor%20Velodrome.aspx |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has played host to many national and international competitions, including the [[1987 Pan American Games]], [[USA Cycling]]'s Collegiate Track National Championships in 2003, 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2017, and USA Cycling's Masters Track National Championships in 2005, 2013, and 2016. In May 2011, Marian University took over operation of the Velodrome property, known as the Indy Cycloplex, which includes a BMX track, mountain bike trails, cyclocross course, and public green space.. In the years following the shift of operation, the facility has focused on promoting youth health and fitness as well as well as the continuous development in the sport of competitive cycling. Weekly &amp; daily programming takes place on the Velodrome from April through September, including a Thursday night race series, the Major Taylor Racing League.

The '''Marriott Center''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] in the [[Western United States|western]] [[United States]], located on the campus of [[Brigham Young University]] in [[Provo, Utah]]. It is home to the [[BYU Cougars]] [[BYU Cougars men's basketball|men's]] and [[BYU Cougars women's basketball|women's]] basketball teams. The seating capacity for basketball games at the Marriott Center is officially 18,987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basketball Facilities|url=http://byucougars.com/facilities/basketball|publisher=BYU Cougars|accessdate=September 3, 2017|quote=BYU's 18,987-seat basketball arena is truly a hoop heaven.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest basketball arena in the [[West Coast Conference]] (in which BYU competes for most sports, except [[BYU Cougars football|football]]), it is among the largest on-campus basketball arenas in the nation. In addition to basketball, the Marriott Center is used for weekly devotionals and forums.

The [[elevation]] of the court is approximately {{convert|4650|ft}} above [[sea level]].

==History==
The Marriott Center was named in honor of benefactor and hotel tycoon [[J. Willard Marriott]], founder of the [[Marriott Corporation]]. When the arena opened {{Time ago|1971}} in 1971, it passed the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Williams Arena]] as the largest college basketball arena in the nation. It was also the largest venue in the nation built for basketball, larger than any [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] (or [[American Basketball Association|ABA]]) arena at that time. It lost both distinctions when the [[University of Kentucky]] opened [[Rupp Arena]] in 1976, but remained as the largest basketball-specific facility on a U.S. college campus until 1987, when the [[University of Tennessee]] opened [[Thompson–Boling Arena]].
[[File:Marriott Center 1971.jpeg|thumb|left|The Marriott Center, circa 1971]]

Prior to 1971, the Cougars played basketball games at [[Smith Fieldhouse]], which remains the primary venue for volleyball and gymnastics. The court was replaced in 2003 with a permanent floor.

The Marriott Center hosted the West Regionals of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] four times ([[1972 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1972]], [[1977 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament|1977]], [[1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament|1979]], [[1982 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1982]]), and the [[Western Athletic Conference]] men's basketball tournament in 1988.

On February 7, 1993, Cody Judy threatened [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] apostle [[Howard W. Hunter]] with a supposed bomb in front of a crowd of 15,000–17,000 onlookers in the Marriott Center.&lt;ref&gt;"California Man Threatens President Hunter, Fireside Audience With Fake Bomb" by Gail Sinnott and Carri P. Jenkins, ''BYU Magazine'', February 1993, pages 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/57824 Daily Universe covers fireside threat on Pres. Hunter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130093403/http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/57824 |date=2010-01-30 }}, by Alicia Barney, BYU ''Daily Universe'', 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the Marriott Center set an NCAA record for highest attendance for a men's volleyball match: 14,156 watched BYU defeat Long Beach State on February 19, shattering the previous record of 10,225 (held by Hawaii).&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/02/20/sports/story6.html Honolulu Star-Bulletin Sports: UH falls to BYU]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovations==
In April 2012, BYU announced renovations to the Marriott Center. The lower bench seating on the north side was replaced with prime chair seating. A new sound system was installed, and the men's and women's locker rooms were renovated.

The '''Northumberland Senior Cup''' is an annual [[rugby union]] competition held between the clubs of the [[Northumberland Rugby Football Union|Northumberland RFU]] which was first played in 1882.  It is the senior [[county cup]] for the [[Northumberland Rugby Football Union|Northumberland Rugby Union]], which includes [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[North Tyneside]], and [[Northumberland]]. The current holders are [[Percy Park RFC|Percy Park]] who defeated [[Alnwick RFC|Alnwick]] in the 2018 cup final. Most games were held at the [[Gosforth Greyhound Stadium|Northumberland County Ground]] from 1932 up until 1988; before and after the County Ground's existence Senior Cup Finals have been played at various venues in the county. 

The Senior Cup is currently the premier county cup competition for club sides based in [[Northumberland]] and [[Tyne and Wear]] typically based at tier 6 ([[North 1 East]]) and tier 7 ([[Durham/Northumberland 1]]) of the [[English rugby union system]], although the 2nd teams of larger clubs in the region such as [[Tynedale R.F.C.|Tynedale]] (who play in [[National League 2 North]]), as well as [[Berwick RFC|Berwick]] (who play in the [[Scottish Regional League (rugby union)|Scottish Regional League]]), have taken part in the competition.  The format is as a knock-out cup with a quarter-final, semi-final and final, which is to be played at a neutral ground in April on Easter Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northumberlandrugbyunion.com/_filecache/8bb/7d0/14817-cup-draws-2016-17.doc|title=CUP DRAWS FOR SEASON 2016-17 (Word doc)|publisher=Northumberland RFU|accessdate=15 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northumberland Senior Plate Winners==

With the advent of professionalism, the gap between some clubs became too great in the county. In 2002 the [[Northumberland Senior Plate (rugby union)|Northumberland Senior Plate]] was inaugurated as a competition for clubs outside of the top 8 Northumberland clubs every season.

'''Oriam''' is Scotland's national performance centre for sport, based at [[Heriot-Watt University]]'s [[Riccarton, Edinburgh|Riccarton]] campus in [[Edinburgh]]. The [[Scottish Rugby Union]] and the [[Scottish Football Association]] use it as a training facility, as do [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.]] for first-team training and to run their academy. It is also used by other sports teams, students and members of the public.

==History==
A review of Scottish football, led by former First Minister of Scotland [[Henry McLeish]], picked up on the lack of facilities in Scotland in the first report published in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/8638920.stm |title=Major report demands changes to Scottish football |work=BBC News |date=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, Sport Minister Shona Robison announced that £25{{nbsp}}million from the Scottish Government's Young Scots Fund would be put towards a new multi-sports centre which would include a national football academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sport-minister-shona-robison-announces-1117424 |title=Sport Minister Shona Robison announces plans for £25m national sports centre |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |date=21 February 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universities, colleges and local authorities were invited to bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/scotland/20814196 |title=Scottish national performance centre for sport to cost £25m |work=BBC Sport |date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2013 there were three finalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/revealed-finalists-vying-for-scottish-national-sport-centre/8651844.article |title=Revealed: finalists vying for Scottish national sport centre |first=Richard |last=Waite |work=[[Architects' Journal]] |registration=y |date=9 August 2013|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, it was announced that the design by Reiach &amp; Hall was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13122553.Edinburgh_wins___30m_National_Sports_Centre/ |title=Edinburgh wins £30m National Sports Centre |first=Paul |last=Ward |work=The Herald |date=13 September 2013 |accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/edinburgh-wins-30m-scottish-national-sport-centre/8653051.article |title=Edinburgh wins £30m Scottish national sport centre |first=Marino |last=Donati |work=Architects' Journal |date=12 September 2013 |registration=y|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining £9{{nbsp}}million towards the cost of building came from [[sportscotland]], Heriot-Watt University and the [[City of Edinburgh Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/edinburgh/scotland-s-33m-world-class-sporting-centre-opens-1-4211790 |title=Scotland’s £33m world-class sporting centre opens |work=The Scotsman |date=24 August 2016 |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2035">In [[cricket]], an '''overthrow''' (sometimes called a '''buzzer''') is an extra [[run (cricket)|run]] scored by a [[batsman]] as a result of the ball not being collected by a [[Fielding (cricket)|fielder]] in the centre, having been thrown in from the [[outfield]]. Overthrows usually occur when a fielder aims unsuccessfully at the [[stumps]] in an attempt to [[run out]] a batsman, although sometimes they are due to handling errors by the fielder receiving the ball.

Runs scored in this manner are counted in addition to any runs already scored before the fielding error took place, and are credited to the batsman. If the ball reaches the [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]] as a result of an overthrow then the four runs for the boundary is added to the number of completed runs before the overthrow,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-19-boundaries,45,AR.html The Laws of Cricket - Law 19.6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915153108/http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-19-boundaries,45,AR.html |date=2008-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can lead to the unusual event of a batsman scoring more than six runs off a single ball. There have been at least four instances in [[Test cricket]] of eight runs being scored off a single ball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/current/story/379416.html Cricinfo - Ask Steven]&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent was by [[Andrew Symonds]] for [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] at [[Brisbane]] in November 2008, when the batsmen managed to run four runs before the ball was thrown back over the wicket keeper's head for a four-run boundary.

It is possible for the ball to be thrown over more than once from the same ball, leading to even more runs being scored. In theory there is therefore no limit to how many runs may be scored off a single ball.

'''Parachuting''', or '''skydiving''', is a method of transiting from a high point to Earth with the aid of gravity, involving the control of speed during the descent with the use of a [[parachute]] or parachutes. It may involve more or less free-falling which is a period when the parachute has not yet been deployed and the body gradually accelerates to [[terminal velocity]].

The first parachute jump in history was made by [[André-Jacques Garnerin]], the inventor of the parachute, on 22 October 1797. Garnerin tested his contraption by leaping from a hydrogen balloon {{convert|3,200|ft}} above Paris. Garnerin's parachute bore little resemblance to today's parachutes, however, as it was not packed into any sort of container and did not feature a ripcord.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-first-parachutist&lt;/ref&gt; The first intentional freefall jump with a ripcord-operated deployment was not made until over a century later by [[Leslie Irvin (parachutist)|Leslie Irvin]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/an-early-history-of-the-parachute-951312/&lt;/ref&gt;  While [[Tiny Broadwick|Georgia Broadwick]] made an earlier freefall in 1914 when her static line became entangled with her jump aircraft's tail assembly, her freefall descent was not planned. Broadwick cut her static line and deployed her parachute manually, only as a means of freeing herself from the aircraft to which she had become entangled.&lt;ref name="broadwick"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/georgia-%E2%80%9Ctiny%E2%80%9D-broadwick%E2%80%99s-parachute |title=Georgia "Tiny" Broadwick’s Parachute |last=Hanser |first=Kathleen |date=12 March 2015 |website= |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum]] |access-date=26 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military developed parachuting technology as a way to save aircrews from emergencies aboard balloons and aircraft in flight, and later as a way of delivering soldiers to the battlefield. Early competitions date back to the 1930s, and it became an international sport in 1952.{{how|date=July 2016}}

Parachuting is performed as a [[recreation]]al activity and a competitive sport, widely considered an [[extreme sport]] due to the risks involved. Modern militaries utilize parachuting for the deployment of [[airborne forces]] and supplies, and [[special operations]] forces commonly employ parachuting, especially free-fall parachuting, as a method of insertion. Occasionally [[forest firefighter]]s, known as "[[smokejumpers]]" in the [[United States]], use parachuting as a means of rapidly inserting themselves near forest fires in especially remote or otherwise inaccessible areas.

Manually exiting an aircraft and parachuting to safety has been widely used by [[aviators]] (especially [[Pilot (aeronautics)#Military|military aviators]] and [[aircrew]]), and passengers to escape an [[aircraft]] that could not otherwise land safely. While this method of escape is relatively rare in modern times, it was commonly used in [[Aviation in World War I|World War I]] by military aviators, and utilized extensively throughout [[Aviation in World War II|the air wars of World War II]]. In modern times, the most common means of escape from an aircraft in distress is via an [[ejection seat]]. Said system is usually operated by the pilot, aircrew member, or passenger, by engaging an activation device manually. In most designs, this will lead to the seat being propelled out of and away from the aircraft carrying the occupant with it, by means of either an explosive charge or a rocket propulsion system. Once clear of the aircraft, the ejection seat will deploy a parachute, although some older models entrusted this step to manual activation by the seat's occupant.

==Safety==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
Despite the perception of danger, fatalities are relatively rare. In the U.S. during the 1970's, the sport averaged 42.5 fatalities annually. In the 80's, the average dropped to 34.1, and in the 90's, the average decreased to 32.3 deaths per year. Between 2000 and 2009, the average dropped to 25.8 and over the eight years after 2009, the annual average declined to 22.4 fatalities (roughly 0.0075 fatalities per 1,000 jumps). In 2017, members of one organization, the United States Parachute Association (USPA) reported 2,585 skydiving injuries sufficiently severe to require resort to a medical care facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uspa.org/Find/FAQs/Safety|title=United States Parachute Association &gt; Find &gt; FAQs &gt; Safety|website=uspa.org|language=en-US|access-date=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US and in most of the western world, skydivers are required to carry two parachutes. The reserve parachute must be periodically inspected and re-packed (whether used or not) by a certified [[parachute rigger]] (in the US, an [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] certificated parachute rigger every 180 days). Many skydivers use an [[automatic activation device]] (AAD) that opens the reserve parachute at a pre-determined altitude if it detects that the skydiver is still in free fall. Depending on the country, AADs are often mandatory for new jumpers, and/or required for all jumpers regardless of their experience level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countries with AAD rules (forum thread)|url=http://www.dropzone.com/forum/Skydiving_C1/General_Skydiving_Discussions_F18/Countries_with_AAD_rules_P3444925/|website=Dropzone.com|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most skydivers wear a visual altimeter, and an increasing number also use audible altimeters fitted to their helmets.

Injuries and fatalities occurring under a fully functional parachute usually happen because the skydiver performed unsafe maneuvers or made an error in judgment while flying their canopy, typically resulting in a high-speed impact with the ground or other hazards on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skydiving Fatalities Database|url=http://www.skydivingfatalities.info/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common sources of injury is a low turn under a high-performance canopy and while swooping. Swooping is the advanced discipline of gliding at high-speed parallel to the ground during landing.

Changing wind conditions are another risk factor. In conditions of strong winds and turbulence during hot days, the parachutist can be caught in downdrafts close to the ground. Shifting winds can cause a crosswind or downwind landing which have a higher potential for injury due to the wind speed adding to the landing speed.

Another risk factor is that of "canopy collisions", or collisions between two or more skydivers under fully inflated parachutes. Canopy collisions can cause the jumpers' inflated parachutes to entangle with each other, often resulting in a sudden collapse (deflation) of one or more of the involved parachutes. When this occurs, the jumpers often must quickly perform emergency procedures (if there is sufficient altitude to do so) to "cut-away" (jettison) from their main canopies and deploy their reserve canopies. Canopy collisions are particularly dangerous when occurring at altitudes too low to allow the jumpers adequate time to safely jettison their main parachutes and fully deploy their reserve parachutes.

Equipment failure rarely causes fatalities and injuries. Approximately one in 750 deployments of a main parachute result in a malfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Webmaster|title=The Safest Year—The 2009 Fatality Summary|url=http://parachutistonline.com/feature/safest-year%E2%80%94-2009-fatality-summary|publisher=Parachutist Online|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ram-air parachutes typically spin uncontrollably when malfunctioning, and must be jettisoned before deploying the reserve parachute.  Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently; they are also designed more conservatively and built and tested to more exacting standards so they are more reliable than main parachutes, but the real safety advantage comes from the probability of an unlikely main malfunction multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction. This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction although the possibility of a main malfunction that cannot be cutaway causing a reserve malfunction is a very real risk.
[[File:Skydiving from a Ukraine Air Force Ilyushin Il-76MD.jpeg|thumb|left|Parachutists jumping from an [[Ilyushin Il-76]] of the [[Ukraine Air Force]] (2014)]]
Parachuting disciplines such as [[BASE jumping]] or those that involve equipment such as [[wingsuit flying]] and [[sky surfing]] have a higher risk factor due to the lower mobility of the jumper and the greater risk of entanglement. For this reason,{{tone inline|date=August 2016}} these disciplines are generally practiced by experienced jumpers.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Depictions in commercial films – notably Hollywood action movies{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} – usually overstate the dangers of the sport.{{tone inline|date=August 2016}} Often, the characters in such films are shown performing feats that are physically impossible without special effects assistance. In other cases, their practices would cause them to be grounded or shunned at any safety-conscious [[drop zone]] or club. USPA member drop zones in the US and Canada are required to have an experienced jumper act as a "safety officer" (in Canada DSO – Drop Zone Safety Officer; in the U.S. S&amp;TA – Safety and Training Advisor) who is responsible for dealing with jumpers who violate rules, regulations, or otherwise act in a fashion deemed unsafe by the appointed individual.

In many countries, either the local regulations or the liability-conscious prudence of the drop zone owners require that parachutists must have attained the [[age of majority]] before engaging in the sport.

The first skydive performed without a parachute was by stuntman Gary Connery on 23 May 2012 at 732 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Book or Records|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781908843159|location=|pages=79|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most common injuries===
Due to the hazardous nature of skydiving, the greatest of precautions are taken to avoid parachuting injuries and death. For first time solo-parachutists, this includes anywhere from 4 to 8 hours of ground instruction.&lt;ref&gt;"Become a Skydiver." USPA. United States Parachute Association, n.d. Web. 30 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the majority of parachute injuries occur upon landing (approximately 85%),&lt;ref name="Ellitsgaard, N 1987"&gt;Ellitsgaard, N. "Parachuting Injuries: A Study of 110,000 Sports Jumps." British Journal of Sports Medicine 21.1 (1987): 13–17. NCBI. Web. 30 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the greatest emphasis within ground training is usually on the proper parachute landing fall (PLF), which seeks to orient the body as to evenly disperse the impact through flexion of several large, insulating muscles (such as the medial [[Gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]], [[tibialis anterior]], [[rectus femoris]], [[vastus medialis]], [[biceps femoris]], and semitendinosus ),&lt;ref&gt;Whitting, John W., Julie R. Steele, Mark A. Jaffrey, and Bridget J. Munro. "Parachute Landing Fall Characteristics at Three Realistic Vertical Descent Velocities." Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine 78.12 (2007): 1135–142. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to individual bones, tendons, and ligaments which break and tear more easily.
[[File:Parachute_injuries.svg|thumb|344px|The percent of injuries caused by an improper landing position.]]
Parachutists, especially those flying smaller sport canopies, often land with dangerous amounts of kinetic energy, and for this reason, improper landings are the cause of more than 30% of all skydiving related injuries and deaths.&lt;ref name="Ellitsgaard, N 1987" /&gt; Often, injuries sustained during parachute landing are caused when a single outstretched limb, such as a hand or foot, is extended separately from the rest of the body, causing it to sustain forces disproportional to the support structures within. This tendency is displayed in the accompanying chart, which shows the significantly higher proportion of wrist and ankle injuries among the 186 injured in a 110,000 parachute jump study.

Due to the possibility of fractures (commonly occurring on the [[tibia]] and the ankle mortise), it is recommended that parachutists wear supportive footwear.&lt;ref name="Ellitsgaard, N 1987"/&gt;  Supportive footwear prevents inward and outward ankle rolling, allowing the PLF to safely transfer impact energy through the true ankle joint, and dissipate it via the medial gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles.

===Weather===
Parachuting in poor weather, especially with thunderstorms, high winds, and dust devils can be a dangerous activity. Reputable drop zones will suspend normal operations during inclement weather. In the United States, the USPA's Basic Safety Requirements prohibit solo student skydivers from jumping in winds exceeding 14&amp;nbsp;mph while using ram-air equipment. However, maximum ground winds are unlimited for licensed skydivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sim.uspa.org/#1=1%7c2=3%7c3=14%7cpage=47|title=USPA Skydiver's Information Manual|work=uspa.org|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visibility===
As parachuting is an aviation activity under the [[visual flight rules]],&lt;ref name=faasafety&gt;{{cite web|title=FAA Safety Library Resources|url=http://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/ALC/libview_normal.aspx?id=7721|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally illegal to jump in or through clouds, according to the relevant rules governing the airspace, such as [[Federal Aviation Regulations|FAR]]105&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations, §105.17   Flight visibility and clearance from cloud requirements|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d5362682be4ae3c04b14766e22e3506e&amp;node=se14.2.105_117&amp;rgn=div8|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US or ''Faldskærmsbestemmelser'' (''Parachuting Ordinances'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faldskærmsbestemmelser, §5.c Ansvar|url=http://www.dfu.dk/dokumenter/regler/FB%20Marts%202014%20samlet.pdf|publisher=Dansk Faldskærmsunion|accessdate=4 September 2014|language=da|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904193030/http://www.dfu.dk/dokumenter/regler/FB%20Marts%202014%20samlet.pdf|archivedate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Denmark. Jumpers and pilots of the dropping aircraft similarly bear responsibility of following the other VFR elements,&lt;ref name=faasafety/&gt; in particular ensuring that the air traffic at the moment of jump does not create a hazard.

===Canopy collisions===
A collision with another canopy is a statistical [[hazard]], and may be avoided by observing simple principles, including knowing upper wind speeds, the number of party members and exit groups, and having sufficient exit separation between jumpers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flight-1.com/sport/documents/safety-code-how-to-avoid-a-canopy-collision|title=Flight-1 :: Safety Code – How to Avoid a Canopy Collision|work=flight-1.com|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, 17% of all skydiving fatalities in the United States resulted from mid-air collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parachutistonline.com/feature/identifying-the-dangers|title=Identifying the Dangers – The 2013 Fatality Summary|work=parachutistonline.com|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Jump training}}

== Training ==
[[File:Parachuting Training.jpg|thumb|right|Instructor explaining the operation of a parachute to student pilots]]
[[File:Quick Exit over Cloud Gap (6367738627).jpg|thumb|Exit from a [[Cessna 208]]]]
Skydiving can be practised without jumping. [[Vertical wind tunnel]]s are used to practise for free fall ("indoor skydiving" or "bodyflight"), while [[virtual reality]] parachute simulators are used to practise [[parachute]] control.

Beginning skydivers seeking training have the following options:

*[[Static line]]
*[[Instructor-assisted deployment]]
*[[Accelerated freefall]]
*[[Tandem skydiving]]

== Parachute deployment ==
At a sport skydiver's deployment altitude, the individual manually deploys a small pilot-chute which acts as a drogue, catching air and pulling out the main parachute or the main canopy. There are two principal systems in use: the "throw-out", where the skydiver pulls a toggle attached to the top of the pilot-chute stowed in a small pocket outside the main container: and the "pull-out", where the skydiver pulls a small pad attached to the pilot-chute which is stowed inside the container.

Throw-out pilot-chute pouches are usually positioned at the bottom of the container – the B.O.C. deployment system – but older harnesses often have leg-mounted pouches. The latter are safe for flat-flying, but often unsuitable for freestyle or head-down flying.

[[File:HIGUEROTE DESDE EL AIRE.png|thumb|left|A parachutist above Venezuela]]

In a typical civilian sport parachute system, the pilot-chute is connected to a line known as the "bridle", which in turn is attached to a small deployment bag that contains the folded parachute and the canopy suspension lines, which are stowed with rubber bands. At the bottom of the container that holds the deployment bag is a closing loop which, during packing, is fed through the grommets of the four flaps that are used to close the container. At that point, a curved pin that is attached to the bridle is inserted through the closing loop. The next step involves folding the pilot-chute and placing it in a pouch (e.g., B.O.C pouch).

Activation begins when the pilot-chute is thrown out. It inflates and creates drag, pulling the pin out of the closing loop and allowing the pilot-chute to pull the deployment bag from the container. The parachute lines are pulled loose from the rubber bands and extend as the canopy starts to open. A rectangular piece of fabric called the "[[slider (parachuting)|slider]]" (which separates the parachute lines into four main groups fed through grommets in the four respective corners of the slider) slows the opening of the parachute and works its way down until the canopy is fully open and the slider is just above the head of the skydiver. The slider slows and controls the deployment of the parachute. Without a slider, the parachute would inflate fast, potentially damaging the parachute fabric and/or suspension lines, as well as causing discomfort, injury or even death of the jumper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to prevent hard openings|url=http://www.performancedesigns.com/docs/hrdopn.pdf|publisher=Performance Designs, Inc.|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a normal deployment, a skydiver will generally experience a few seconds of intense deceleration, in the realm of 3 to 4 g, while the parachute slows the descent from {{convert|190|km/h|mi/h|-1|abbr=on}} to approximately 28&amp;nbsp;km/h (17&amp;nbsp;mph).

If a skydiver experiences a malfunction of their main parachute which they cannot correct, they pull a "cut-away" handle on the front right-hand side of their harness (on the chest) which will release the main canopy from the harness/container. Once free from the malfunctioning main canopy, the reserve canopy can be activated manually by pulling a second handle on the front left harness. Some containers are fitted with a connecting line from the main to reserve parachutes – known as a [[reserve static line]] (RSL) – which pulls open the reserve container faster than a manual release could. Whichever method is used, a spring-loaded pilot-chute then extracts the reserve parachute from the upper half of the container.

==Disciplines and maneuvers==

===Accuracy===
One example of this is "Hit and Rock", a variant of [[accuracy landing]] devised to let people of varying skill levels compete for fun. "Hit and Rock" is originally from POPS (Parachutists Over Phorty Society). The object is to land as close as possible to the chair, remove the parachute harness, sprint to the chair, sit fully in the chair and rock back and forth at least one time. The contestant is timed from the moment that feet touch the ground until that first rock is completed.  This event is considered a race.

===Angle Flying===
Angle Flying was presented for the first time in 2000 at the World Freestyle Competitions, the European Espace Boogie, and the Eloy Freefly Festival.

The technique consists of flying diagonally with a determinate relation between angle and trajectory speed of the body, to obtain an air stream that allows for control of flight. The aim is to fly in formation at the same level and angle, and to be able to perform different aerial games, such as freestyle, three-dimensional flight formation with grip, or acrobatic free-flying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dropzone.com/safety/Disciplines/Freeflying/The_History_of_Atmonauti_Fly_559.html|title=The History of Atmonauti Fly|work=dropzone.com|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Base jumping===
{{main article|BASE jumping}}

===Classic accuracy===

[[File:Precision d'Atterrissage - ThomasJeannerot2013.jpg|thumb|Accuracy Landing – Thomas Jeannerot 2013]]

Classic accuracy is running with opened parachute, in individual or team contest. The aim is to touch down on a target whose center is 2&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. The target can be a deep foam mattress or an air-filled landing pad. 
An electronic recording pad of 32&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter is set in the middle. It measures score in 1&amp;nbsp;cm increments up to 16&amp;nbsp;cm and displays result just after landing.

The first part of any competition take place over 8 rounds. Then in the individual competition, after this 8 selective rounds, the top 25% jump a semi-final round. After semi-final round, the top 50% are selected for the final round.
The competitor with the lowest cumulative score is declared the winner.

Competitors jump in teams of 5 maximum, exiting the aircraft at 1000 or 1200 meters and opening their parachutes sequentially to allow each competitor a clear approach to the target.

This sport is unpredictable because weather conditions play a very important part. So classic accuracy requires high adaptability to aerology and excellent steering control.

It is also the most interesting discipline for spectator due to the closeness of action (a few metres) and the possibility to be practised everywhere (sport ground, stadium, urban place...).
Today, classic accuracy is the most practiced (in competition) discipline of skydiving in the world.

[[File:Canopy Relative Work (CReW).jpg|thumb|Two parachutists perform a dock on a Canopy Relative Work (CReW) jump]]

===Canopy Relative Work (CReW)===
A Canopy Relative Work, or CREW jump for short (also known as Canopy Formation flying), is a skydive where the participants open their parachutes very quickly after leaving the aircraft with the intention of flying in close proximity to each other. The goal is to create various formations by "docking" with other parachutists on the jump. The dock is often accomplished by placing ones feet into the lines of another person's parachute. Formations require at least 2 people, but can have many more.

Due to the close proximity of the canopies, care has to be taken by all participants to ensure the safety of the jump. It is common for a CREW jumper to carry a hook knife to use in case they become entangled in another jumpers lines.

===Cross-country===
A [[cross-country jump]] is a skydive where the participants open their parachutes immediately after jumping, with the intention of covering as much ground under canopy as possible. Usual distance from jump run to the dropzone can be as much as several miles.

[[File:technoavia smg-92 turbo finist ha-ydf at kemble arp.jpg|thumb|A [[Technoavia SM92 Finist]] of [[Target Skysports]] lifts skydivers to the jump altitude at [[Hibaldstow]], England]]
There are two variations of a cross-country jump:

The more popular one is to plan the exit point upwind of the drop zone. A map and information about the wind direction and velocity at different altitudes are used to determine the exit point. This is usually set at a distance from where all the participants should be able to fly back to the drop zone.

The other variation is to jump out directly above the drop zone and fly down wind as far as possible. This increases the risks of the jump substantially, as the participants must be able to find a suitable landing area before they run out of altitude.

Two-way radios and cell-phones are often used to make sure everyone has landed safely, and, in case of a landing off the drop zone, to find out where the parachutist is so that ground crew can pick them up.

===Formation skydiving===
{{main article|Formation skydiving|Big-ways}}

Formation Skydiving (FS) was born in California, USA during the 1960s. The first documented skydiving formation occurred over Arvin, California in March 1964 when Mitch Poteet, Don Henderson, Andy Keech and Lou Paproski successfully formed a 4-man star formation, photographed by Bob Buquor. This discipline was formerly referred to in the skydiving community as Relative Work, often abbreviated to RW, Relly or Rel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starcrestawards.com/history/history_the_first_rw_records.html|title=First RW Records|author=BBMSC|work=starcrestawards.com|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freeflying===
{{main article|Freeflying}}

===Night jumps===
Parachuting is not always restricted to daytime hours; experienced skydivers sometimes perform night jumps. For safety reasons, this requires more equipment than a usual daytime jump and in most jurisdictions, it requires both an advanced skydiving license (at least a B-License in the U.S.) and a meeting with the local safety official covering who will be doing what on the load. A lit altimeter (preferably accompanied with an audible altimeter) is a must. Skydivers performing night jumps often take flashlights up with them so that they can check their canopies have properly deployed.

Visibility to other skydivers and other aircraft is also a consideration; FAA regulations require skydivers jumping at night to be wearing a light visible for three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) in every direction, and to turn it on once they are under canopy. A chem-light(glowstick) is a good idea on a night jump.

Night jumpers should be made aware of the dark zone, when landing at night. Above 30 meters (100 feet) jumpers flying their canopy have a good view of the landing zone normally because of reflected ambient light/moon light. Once they get close to the ground, this ambient light source is lost, because of the low angle of reflection. The lower they get, the darker the ground looks. At about 100 feet and below it may seem that they are landing in a black hole. Suddenly it becomes very dark, and the jumper hits the ground soon after. This ground rush should be explained to, and anticipated by, the first time night jumper. Recommendations should be made to the jumper to utilize a canopy that is larger than they typically use on a day jump and to attempt to schedule their first night jump as close to a full moon as possible to make it easier to see the ground.

While more dangerous than regular skydiving and more difficult to schedule, two night jumps are required by the USPA for a jumper to obtain their D (expert) license.

===Pond swooping===
{{main article|Canopy piloting}}
Pond swooping is a form of competitive parachuting wherein canopy pilots attempt to touch down and glide across a small body of water, and onto the shore. Events provide lighthearted competition, rating accuracy, speed, distance and style. Points and peer approval are reduced when a participant "chows", or fails to reach shore and sinks into the water. Swoop ponds are not deep enough to drown in under ordinary circumstances, their main danger being from the concussive force of an incorrectly executed maneuver. In order to gain distance, swoopers increase their speed by executing a "hook turn", wherein both speed and difficulty increase with the angle of the turn. Hook turns are most commonly measured in increments of 90 degrees. As the angle of the turn increases, both horizontal and vertical speed are increased, such that a misjudgement of altitude or imprecise manipulation of the canopy's control structures (front risers, rear risers, and toggles) can lead to a high speed impact with the pond or Earth. Prevention of injury is the main reason why a pond is used for swooping rather than a grass landing area.

===Skysurfing===
{{main article|Skysurfing}}

===Space Ball===
This is when skydivers have a ball which weighs 455–590 grams and release it in free fall. The ball maintains the same fall rate as the skydivers. The skydivers can pass the ball around to each other whilst in free fall. At a predetermined altitude, the "ball master" will catch the ball and hold on to it to ensure it does not impact the ground. Space balls are prohibited at many drop zones, due to risk to persons and property on the ground in the event that the ball is not caught or dropped during/after deployment

[[File:Spaceball jump over Skydive 35.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|Spaceball Jump]]

===Style===

[[File:Thomasjeannerot style.jpg|thumb|Style – Thomas Jeannerot]]
[[File:Voltige ThomasJeannerot2013.jpg|thumb|Style – Thomas Jeannerot 2013]]

Style can be considered as sprint of parachuting. This individual discipline is played in free fall.

The idea is to take maximum speed and complete a pre-designated series of maneuvers as fast and cleanly as possible (speed can exceed 400&amp;nbsp;km/h / 250&amp;nbsp;mph)

Jumps are filmed using a ground-based camera (with an exceptional lens to record the performance).

Performance is timed (from the start of the maneuver until its completion) and then judged in public at the end of the jump.
Competition includes 4 qualifying rounds and a final for the top 8. 
Competitors jump from a height of 2200 m to 2500 m.

They rush into an acceleration stage for 15 to 20 seconds and then run their series of maneuvers benefiting to the maximum of the stored speed.

Those series consist of Turns and Back-Loops to achieve in a pre-designated order. The incorrect performance of the maneuvers gives rise to penalties that are added at runtime.

The performance of the athlete is defined in seconds and hundredths of a second.
The competitor with the lowest cumulative time is declared the winner.

Notice the complete sequence is performed by leading international experts in just over 6 seconds, penalties included.

===Stuff jumps===
[[File:Dingyjump.jpg|thumb|A skydiver sits in a rubber raft steadied by three other jumpers]]

Thanks to large unpopulated areas to jump over, 'stuff' jumps become possible. These jumps consist of skydivers leaving the aircraft with some object. Rubber raft jumps are popular; where the jumpers sit in a rubber raft. Cars, bicycles, motorcycles, vacuum cleaners, water tanks, and inflatable companions have also been thrown out the back of an aircraft. At a certain altitude, the jumpers break off from the object and deploy their parachutes, leaving it to smash into the ground at [[terminal velocity]].

===Swoop and chug===
A tradition at many drop zones is the swoop and chug. As parachutists land from the last load of the day, other skydivers often hand the landing skydivers a beer that is customarily chugged in the landing area. This is sometimes timed as a friendly competition but is usually an informal, untimed, kick-off for the night's festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iloveskydiving.org/view/videos/inspired-skydive-swooping-accuracy-swoop-chug/|title=Teem – Inspired Accuracy: Swoop &amp; Chug|work=iloveskydiving.org|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tracking===
Tracking is where skydivers take a body position to achieve a high forward speed, allowing them to cover a great distance over the ground. Tracking is also used at the end of group jumps to achieve separation from other jumpers before parachute deployment. The tracking position involves sweeping the arms out to the side of the body and straightening the legs with the toes pointed.

===Tunnel flying===
{{main article|Vertical wind tunnel}}

Using a [[vertical wind tunnel]] to simulate free fall has become a discipline of its own and is not only used for training but has its own competitions, teams, and figures.

===Wingsuit flying===
{{main article|Wingsuit flying}}
'Wingsuit flying' or 'wingsuiting' is the sport of flying through the air using a wingsuit, which adds surface area to the human body to enable a significant increase in [[Aerodynamic lift|lift]]. The common type of wingsuit creates an extra surface area with fabric between the legs and under the arms.

==Organizations==
National parachuting associations exist in many countries, many affiliated with the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI), to promote their sport. In most cases, national representative bodies, as well as local drop zone operators, require that participants carry certification attesting to their training their level of experience in the sport, and their proven competence. Anyone who cannot produce such bona-fides is treated as a student, requiring close supervision.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The sole organization in the United States is the [[United States Parachute Association]] (USPA), which issues licenses and ratings, governs skydiving, publishes Parachutist Magazine, and represents skydiving to government agencies. USPA publishes the Skydivers Information Manual (SIM) and many other resources. In Canada, the [[Canadian Sport Parachuting Association]] is the lead organization.  In South Africa, the sport is managed by the [[Parachute Association of South Africa]], and in the United Kingdom by the [[British Parachute Association]]. In Brazil the CNP (Centro Nacional de Paraquedismo) sets in Boituva, where many records have been broken and where it is known for being the 2nd largest center in the world and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Within the sport, associations promote safety, technical advances, training-and-certification, competition and other interests of their members. Outside their respective communities, they promote their sport to the public and often intercede with government regulators.

Competitions are organized at regional, national and international levels in most these disciplines. Some of them offer amateur competition.

Many of the more photogenic/videogenic variants also enjoy sponsored events with prize money for the winners.

The majority of jumpers tend to be non-competitive, enjoying the opportunity to skydive with their friends on weekends and holidays. The atmosphere of their gatherings is relaxed, sociable and welcoming to newcomers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Skydiving events, called "boogies", are arranged at local, national and international scale each year, which attracting both young jumpers and their elders – Parachutists Over Phorty (POPs), Skydivers Over Sixty (SOS) and even older groups.

==Drop zones==
[[File:Parachute - Landing - 001.ogv|thumb|A parachute landing]]
{{Main article|Drop zone}}
In parachuting, a drop zone or DZ is most technically the area above and around a location where a parachutist freefalls and expects to land. In common use it often refers to the totality of a skydiving operation (a business). And the area wherein parachutists land will be referred to as the "landing area."  The drop zone is usually situated beside a small airport, often sharing the facility with other [[general aviation]] activities. Drop zone staff may include the DZO (drop zone operator or owner), manifest, pilots, instructors, coaches, cameramen, packers, riggers and other general staff.

==Equipment==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Costs in the sport are not trivial. As new technological advances or performance enhancements are introduced, equipment tends to increase in price.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Similarly, the average skydiver carries more equipment than in earlier years, with safety devices (such as an [[Automatic activation device|AAD]]) contributing to a significant portion of the cost.
 
A full set of brand-new equipment can easily cost as much as a new motorcycle or half a small car.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The market is not large enough to permit the steady lowering of prices that is seen with some other equipment like computers.&lt;br /&gt;
A new main canopy for the experienced parachutist can cost between $2,000 and $3,000 US &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.performancedesigns.com/docs/PriceSheet.pdf PD Price List – Main Canopies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icaruscanopies.aero/images/downloads/ic_list_price_09_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flyaerodyne.com/download/Aerodyne_PriceList.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Higher performance and Tandem Parachutes cost significantly more, whilst large docile student parachutes often cost less.

Most parachuting equipment is ruggedly designed and is enjoyed by several owners before being retired. A rigger is trained to spot signs of damage or misuse. Riggers also keep track of industry product and safety bulletins, and can, therefore, determine if a piece of equipment is up-to-date and serviceable.

'''Perth Oval''' (also known as '''nib Stadium''' under a [[naming rights]] agreement with [[nib Health Funds]]; will be known as '''HBF Park''' from 2019 under an agreement with [[HBF Health Fund|HBF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.venueswest.wa.gov.au/news/perths-leading-rectangular-venue-to-be-renamed-hbf-park/|title=Perth's leading rectangular venue to be renamed HBF Park {{!}} VenuesWest|website=VenuesWest|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a sports stadium in [[Perth]], the capital of the [[Australian states and territories|Australian state]] of [[Western Australia]]. Located close to [[Perth (suburb)|Perth's central business district]], the stadium currently has a maximum capacity of 20,500 people for sporting events and 25,000 people for concerts, with the ground's record attendance of 32,000 people set during an [[Ed Sheeran]] concert in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ed Sheeran Concert Breaks Record at nib Stadium|url=http://www.nibstadium.com.au/news/ed-sheeran-concert-breaks-record-at-nib-stadium/|publisher=Venues West|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land on which the stadium was built was made a public reserve in 1904, with the main ground developed several years later.

Perth Oval was the home ground of the [[East Perth Football Club]] in the [[West Australian Football League]] (WAFL) from 1910 until 2002, and hosted several of the competition's [[grand final]]s during that time. In 2004, the ground was redeveloped, altering it from an oval field to a rectangular field. The ground is currently home to two major professional sporting clubs: [[Perth Glory FC]], a [[Association football|soccer]] team competing in the [[A-League]], and the [[Western Force]], a [[rugby union]] team competing in the [[Global Rapid Rugby]] competition. The ground is also used by the [[WA Reds]], a semi-professional [[rugby league]] team competing in the [[S. G. Ball Cup]], as well as for concerts.

==Current use==
The stadium is currently used for hosting sports events and concerts.

===Sport===
In sports mode the stadium has a capacity of around 20,500. [[Association football|Soccer]] club [[Perth Glory]] has played at the ground since 1996. The stadium is unusual among modern Australian stadiums for having a standing [[Terrace (stadium)|terrace]] at the northern end of the ground, called 'The Shed'. A breakaway group from the vocal [[Association football culture#Fans|supporters]] of the [[Perth Glory]] 'Shed', named 'Glory Fans United', are now situated in the Southern Stand.

The ground has hosted rugby union team Western Force since 2010. The Force's move to the stadium led to a minor redevelopment of facilities at the ground, including an increase in capacity and improved lighting.&lt;ref name="rugbyweek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rugbyweek.com/news/viewarticle.asp?id=22287 | title=The Force gets new home stadium for 2010 | work=Rugby Week | date=25 September 2009 | accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2008 the stadium hosted [[WA Reds]] home matches in the [[Bundaberg Red Cup]].

Since 2009, there have been annual [[NRL]] games played at the oval, generally as [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] home games, with the [[Manly Warringah Sea Eagles]] joining in 2016. The stadium has housed the administrative facilities of the [[Western Australia Rugby League]] since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://stats.rleague.com/rl/venues/perth.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the stadium hosted a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier]] between the [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] and [[Bangladesh national football team|Bangladesh]], the first A-international in Perth in over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socceroos.com.au/article/socceroos-to-play-world-cup-qualifier-in-perth/hk3ff72t7u951qz3uivzbp4db|title=Socceroos to play World Cup qualifier against Bangladesh in Perth|work=socceroos.com.au|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerts===
The capacity for [[concerts]] is now over 25,000.&lt;ref name="thewest-capacity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/-/music/9799567/foo-fighters-to-start-oz-tour-in-perth/ | title=Foo Fighters to start Oz tour in Perth | work=The West Australian | date=8 July 2011 | accessdate=8 July 2011 | last=Collins|first= Simon | last2=Zuel|first2= Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt; A record 32,000 crowd attended the [[Ed Sheeran]] concert in 2015.

==History==

===Early history===
The land on which the stadium is built was known as '''Loton's Paddock''' after the previous owner [[William Loton]], [[Lord Mayor of Perth]].&lt;ref name="tov1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vincent.wa.gov.au/agenda/whatsnew/Media/Perth%20Oval%20update2.pdf|title=New public land surrounding Perth Oval to be co-named after original|date=9 April 2003|publisher=[[Town of Vincent]]|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paddock had been reclaimed from part of Stone's Lake, which was part of a lake system known as [[Perth Wetlands|The Great Lakes District]] which included [[Lake Monger]] and [[Herdsman Lake]].&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt;

Loton sold the land to the [[City of Perth]] in 1904 with the purpose of providing recreation for the residents of the area. After the 2004 redevelopment, part of the ground reverted to public open space and the original name, Loton Park was re-applied, to honour Loton, and Yoordgoorading as a reference to the original Indigenous inhabitants of the land.&lt;ref name="tov1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sale"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article84575677 | title=A new recreation ground - handing over the titles | work=The Daily News | date=8 November 1904 | accessdate=29 November 2013|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s large white entry gates were built on the north west corner of the ground. These have since been heritage listed.&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt;

===Soccer===
[[File:Perth v North Queensland.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Perth Glory and North Queensland Fury in 2009 during an [[A-League]] match.]]
[[Association football|Soccer]] was an early tenant at Loton Park, playing regular matches as early as 1903, when over 2,000 spectators attended a Charity Cup match between Olympic FC and Civil Service.&lt;ref name="foep1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnet.net.au/~daveiza/royals/po.html |title=Brief History of Perth Oval |publisher=Fight On East Perth|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 the land was offered to the WA British Football Association for £2000, but the asking price was considered too high.&lt;ref name="foep1"/&gt;

Perth Oval was the scene of a humiliation in 1927 when the [[Western Australia state football team|WA State]] team were thrashed 11–3 by [[Bohemians 1905|Bohemians]], a team representing [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="foep1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ole1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oleole.com/blogs/bohemians1905/posts/why-is-there-a-kangaroo-in-the-emblem-of-the-central-european-club|title=why is there a kangaroo in the emblem of the central european club???|date=15 May 2008|publisher=oleole.com|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2004 redevelopment, Perth Oval was oval-shaped, and when [[Perth Glory FC]] entered the [[National Soccer League|NSL]] in 1996, temporary stands were moved onto the pitch to get supporters closer to the action. After playing in these conditions for four years, it became apparent that the Glory would need their own rectangular stadium and after Glory's proposed redevelopment of [[Leederville Oval]] was rejected, the [[Town of Vincent]] completely overhauled the ground into a rectangular stadium.

Perth Glory are now major tenants of this stadium and continue play their home games at Perth Oval.
Perth Oval also hosted the 2014 [[W-League (Australia)|W-League]] Semi-Final and Grand Final matches involving [[Perth Glory FC W-League|Perth Glory Women]].

2015 saw the return of the [[Australia national football team|Socceroos]] to Perth after a 10-year absence, with a 5–0 [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2018 FIFA World Cup Qualifier]] win against [[Bangladesh national football team|Bangladesh]] on 3 September, in front of a 19,495-strong crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socceroos.com.au/matchcentre/Australia-v-Bangladesh/800453 |title=Five-star Socceroos overwhelm Bangladesh |publisher=Football Federation Australia |work=socceroos.com.au |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year on 1 September the [[Australia national football team|Socceroos]] returned for another World Cup Qualifier against [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]], with 18,923 in attendance.

In 1956 the F.D. Book Stand was built as part of East Perth Football Club’s golden jubilee celebrations. It was named after administrator [[Fred Book]], who was instrumental in ensuring Perth Oval stayed as a sporting ground during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="foep1"/&gt;

The ground was briefly used as a home base for East Perth's WAFL rivals [[West Perth Football Club|West Perth]] and [[Perth Football Club|Perth]].&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt; Six [[West Australian Football League]] Grand Finals were played at Perth Oval, the first being in 1912 and the last in 1935.&lt;ref name="wafl1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wafl.com.au/games|title=History|publisher=[[West Australian Football League]]|accessdate=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cricket===
Perth Oval was home to [[Western Australian Grade Cricket]] teams North Perth and University. North Perth played at the oval between 1910 and 1975 and University between 1913 and 1929.&lt;ref name="foep1"/&gt;

===Rugby union===

The ground has occasionally been used by the Western Australian Rugby Union to host state league finals matches at least as far back as 1940.&lt;ref name="west-rugbyfinals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46737760 | title=Rugby - Matches at Perth Oval | work=The West Australian | date=13 September 1940 | accessdate=8 July 2011|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first game played at the venue was in the [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997 Super League season]]. The Perth-based [[Western Reds]] moved their round 4 game against the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] to the oval due to the unavailability of their usual home ground, the [[WACA Ground|WACA]].

'''Providence Park''' (formerly '''Jeld-Wen Field'''; '''PGE Park'''; '''Civic Stadium'''; originally '''Multnomah Stadium'''; and from 1893 until the stadium was built, '''Multnomah Field''')&lt;ref name="prince"/&gt; is an outdoor sports venue in the [[Pacific Northwest|northwest]] [[United States]], located in the [[Goose Hollow, Portland, Oregon|Goose Hollow]] neighborhood of [[Portland, Oregon]]. It has existed in rudimentary form since 1893, and as a complete stadium since 1926.

The [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] [[Portland Timbers]] and [[National Women's Soccer League|NWSL]] [[Portland Thorns FC]] [[soccer]] teams use the facility as their home [[pitch (sports field)|pitch]], as do the [[Premier Development League|PDL]]'s [[Portland Timbers U23s|Timbers U23s]]. The [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] [[Portland State Vikings football]] team uses the park during the [[Big Sky Conference|Big Sky]] season. The stadium has been host to several major sporting events including [[Soccer Bowl '77]], the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]] and [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup]]s, the 2009 [[Triple-A All-Star Game]], the [[2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the [[2014 MLS All-Star Game]] and the [[2015 National Women's Soccer League season#Championship|2015 NWSL Championship Game]]. The stadium capacity will be expanded with 4,000 new seats within the next years.&lt;ref&gt;http://stadiumdb.com/news/2017/04/new_design_five_tiers_for_portland&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the park was owned by the [[Multnomah Athletic Club]] and used by their amateur sports teams. In the 1950s, the [[Pacific Coast League|PCL]] [[Portland Beavers]] [[baseball]] team moved out of [[Vaughn Street Park]] into what was then known as "Multnomah Stadium." In 1966, the city purchased the stadium and renamed it "Civic Stadium." It was renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Beavers, who had not played at the park since the early 1990s. The naming rights of the stadium were purchased by [[Portland General Electric]] and it was renamed "PGE Park." In 2010, the park underwent renovations again, this time so it could accommodate the Portland Timbers MLS franchise and a year later the rights to the stadiums name were sold, this time to [[Jeld-Wen]]. In 2014, the name was changed again to "Providence Park" after [[Providence Health &amp; Services]] bought the naming rights.&lt;ref name=providence&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/timbers/index.ssf/2014/02/portland_timbers_make_an_annou.html|title=Portland Timbers to rename their stadium Providence Park|date=February 10, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2014|newspaper=The Oregonian|last=Goldberg|first=Jamie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium sits on a rectangular block bounded by Southwest Morrison Street, Southwest 18th Avenue, the Multnomah Athletic Club building and Southwest Salmon Street, and Southwest 20th Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vikings Play At Jeld-Wen Field In 2011|url=http://goviks.com/news/2011/3/14/FB_0314112948.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PGE Park renamed Jeld-Wen Field|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42078697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Providence Park is an outdoor stadium which houses the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] [[Portland Timbers]], [[National Women's Soccer League|NWSL]] [[Portland Thorns FC|Portland Thorns]], and [[Portland State Vikings football|Portland State University Vikings]] football. The stadium underwent a $31 million renovation in late 2010 and early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portlandtimbers.com/stadium-renovation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414041534/http://www.portlandtimbers.com/stadium-renovation |archivedate=April 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is owned by the City of Portland, and is managed by Peregrine Sports, LLC, the entity that owns the Timbers and Thorns.

Prior to the 2011 MLS season, the stadium was renamed Jeld-Wen Field from PGE Park, in a partnership with [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]] based company Jeld-Wen. Jeld-Wen is a manufacturer of windows and doors, leading to the stadium's nickname, "The House of Pane." In 2014, the stadium was renamed Providence Park after a partnership with [[Providence Health &amp; Services]] was announced.&lt;ref name=providence/&gt;

The [[Multnomah Athletic Club]], an [[sports club|athletic club]] in downtown Portland, stands next door; the windows of the north side of the club's building overlook the field.

The [[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|Interstate 405]] freeway in Portland is also known locally as the Stadium Freeway and travels near the stadium. In addition, the [[Providence Park (MAX station)|Providence Park]] [[MAX Light Rail]] station is across the street. The property slopes significantly downhill from the south end to the north end, with the result that the playing surface sits well below street level, the [[elevation]] at street level is approximately {{convert|110|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]].

==Tenants==
The stadium is currently home to the [[Portland Timbers]] of [[Major League Soccer|MLS]], [[Portland Thorns FC]] of [[National Women's Soccer League|NWSL]], and is also used for several [[Portland State Vikings football|Portland State University Vikings]] [[American football|football]] home games each season.

===Former tenants===
The [[Portland Beavers]] [[minor league baseball]] team of the [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL) had played some games at Multnomah Field during 1905 when their [[Vaughn Street Park]] was temporarily reconfigured to host a track and field event. They moved into Multnomah Stadium in 1956 after over a half century at Vaughn Street, a wooden [[Baseball park|ballpark]] which was soon demolished. The sod from the baseball field at Vaughn Street was transferred to the new venue; Civic Stadium installed [[artificial turf]] in 1969.

[[File:Multnomah Stadium postcard.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Before the city purchased the stadium, it was owned by the [[Multnomah Athletic Club]]]]

From 1973 to 1977 the [[independent baseball league|independent]] [[Portland Mavericks]] of the [[Northwest League]] played their home games at the stadium. Actor [[Kurt Russell]] was an [[infielder]] for the Mavericks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurt Russell Minor League Statistics &amp; History|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=russel001kur|work=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beavers returned to Portland in 1978 until 1993 when they were moved out of the city again. The [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[Portland Rockies]] were established in 1995 and played at the park until 2000 when they were moved and renamed the [[Tri-City Dust Devils]]. In 2001, the [[Albuquerque Dukes]] were moved to Portland and renamed the "Beavers" marking the third time the franchise would occupy the park for their home games.

As a baseball venue, the stadium had an unorthodox south-southeast alignment, with home plate in the northwest corner (20th and Morrison) of the property.

After it was announced that [[Major League Soccer]] was moving a franchise to Providence Park (then known as PGE Park) the Beavers baseball team had to start looking for a [[Portland Beavers Ballpark|new stadium]]. However, the plan never came to fruition and team owner [[Merritt Paulson]] put the Beavers up for sale. The club's [[Major League Baseball|major-league]] parent, the [[San Diego Padres]], purchased the team, which moved to [[Tucson, Arizona]] as the [[Tucson Padres]]. The team played its final game at the stadium on September 6, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Portland Beavers Moving to Tucson|url=http://ballparkdigest.com/201010153186/minor-league-baseball/features/bevos-to-tucson-for-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=larabee52909&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/portlandcityhall/2009/05/beavers_must_move_out_of_pge_p.html|title=Beavers Must Move Out of PGE Park, League Says|last=Larabee|first=Mark|date=May 29, 2009|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium hosted the [[United States Football League|USFL]]'s [[Portland Breakers]], as well as the [[Portland Storm]] and [[Portland Thunder]] of the [[World Football League|WFL]].

Soccer has been hosted at Providence Park since the [[Portland Timbers (1975–1982)|original Portland Timbers]] were founded in the original [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]] in 1975. Various iterations of the team have called the stadium home, including the [[Portland Timbers (1985–1990)|1980s version]] in the [[Western Soccer Alliance]] and the [[Portland Timbers (2001–2010)|2000s version]] in the [[USL First Division]] before the MLS club was formed.

==History==
[[File:Multnomah Stadium, 1940s.jpg|thumb|Providence Park (then known as Multnomah Civic Stadium) photographed in 1941]]
Since 1893, the site had been home to Multnomah Field, which consisted of sports fields with various [[grandstand]]s.&lt;ref name=ohs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=0009B37C-450F-1E94-891B80B0527200A7 |title=Civic Stadium |publisher=Oregon Historical Society |accessdate=April 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104033306/http://ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=0009B37C-450F-1E94-891B80B0527200A7 |archivedate=January 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oregon_Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/multnomah_stadium_civic_stadium_pge_park_jeld_wen_field_/ | title=Multnomah Stadium | website=www.oregonencyclopedia.org | access-date=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was built in 1926 for $502,000, by what is now known as Multnomah Athletic Club, who named it '''Multnomah Civic Stadium'''.&lt;ref name="to02-2014"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.oregonlive.com/timbers/index.ssf/2014/02/issues_and_answers_no_matter_w.html | title= Issues and Answers: No matter what the stadium is called, Providence Park is a place where memories are made | date= February 11, 2014 | first= Jason |last= Quick| publisher= The Oregonian | quote= It was built in 1926 by what is now the Multnomah Athletic Club for $502,000 and called Multnomah Civic Stadium.

[[File:Multnomah Stadium, 1940.JPG|thumb|left|The stadium in 1940]]
The site was used for college football (including seven [[Civil War (college football game)|Civil War games]] between the [[Oregon Ducks football|University of Oregon]] and [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State University]]), cricket matches and [[greyhound racing]]. Well into the 1960s, most significant football games hosted by Oregon and Oregon State were held at this site because of its capacity. Oregon played in [[Oregon Ducks football venues#Multnomah Field (1894–1925) / Multnomah Stadium (1926–1970)|107 games]] at Multnomah/Civic Stadium between 1894 and 1970. The [[Washington Huskies football|University of Washington]] played all its road games against Oregon and Oregon State at Multnomah Field/Multnomah Stadium until 1966 (OSU) and 1967 (Oregon). The site also hosted the [[Portland Rose Festival]] coronation and a Fourth of July appearance by President [[Warren G. Harding]].&lt;ref name=ohs/&gt;

In the 1950s, the [[Portland Beavers]] moved to the stadium after their original field, [[Vaughn Street Park]], was condemned. In 1966, the Multnomah Athletic Club sold the stadium for $2.1 million to the city of Portland, which renamed it '''Civic Stadium'''.&lt;ref name=ohs/&gt;&lt;ref name="to02-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rename&gt;{{cite press release |title=Timbers rename home stadium JELD-WEN Field |url=http://www.portlandtimbers.com/news/2011/03/timbers-rename-home-stadium-jeld-wen-field |publisher=Portland Timbers |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=April 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318054827/http://www.portlandtimbers.com/news/2011/03/timbers-rename-home-stadium-jeld-wen-field |archivedate=March 18, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renovations===
A $38.5 million renovation took place in 2001, upgrading the seating and concourse area, and adding new [[Luxury box|luxury suites]] and club seats. The renovation improved the structural soundness of the facility, and introduced a new sound system. The renovation also includes some [[Retro style|retro-features]], such as a manually operated [[Scoreboard#Baseball|baseball scoreboard]]. At that point, [[Portland General Electric|PGE]] bought the naming rights and it became '''PGE Park'''.&lt;ref name=rename/&gt;

In July 2009, after attempts to both find a new home for an MLS franchise and identify a [[Portland Beavers Ballpark|site for a new home for the Portland Beavers]], the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] approved a $31 million renovation to make PGE Park ready for the [[2011 Major League Soccer season]], by reconfiguring the stadium primarily for soccer and football.&lt;ref name=larabee062409&gt;{{Cite news |url =http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2009/06/major_league_soccer_plan_still.html|title=Major League Soccer plan still alive as Portland council endorses latest plan|date=June 24, 2009|access-date=June 25, 2009|last=Larabee|first=Mark|work=[[The Oregonian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oreg-jul2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Haberman|first=Margaret|title=$31 million PGE Park renovation passes 4–1|date=July 23, 2009|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2009/07/31_million_pge_park_renovation.html|access-date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision led to the departure of the Beavers.

[[File:Providence Park.jpg|thumb|left|The stadium in 2016]]
The renovation was performed by [[Turner Construction]], who served as the general contractor and also performed the 2001 renovation, and [[Ellerbe Becket]] as the primary architect. A presentation to the Portland Design Commission indicated that 5,000 seats would be added, bringing capacity to about 22,000, but with only about 18,000 available for use on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="oreg-5aug2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jug|first=Helen|title=Vision for PGE Park: A place that says 'soccer'|date=August 5, 2009|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/portlandbeavers/2009/08/renovated_pge_park_will_showca.html|access-date=April 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311034002/http://blog.oregonlive.com/portlandbeavers/2009/08/renovated_pge_park_will_showca.html|archive-date=March 11, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renovation met Major League Soccer standards, introduced a new playing surface, which shifted west and north, and added space on the east and south sides, with new seating areas and new amenities. The Lighthouse Impact 16 main video screen was designed by Anthony James Partners and features over 74 square meters of LED video. A Lighthouse B10 pitchside display runs the length of the east side and portions of the north and south ends and is over 152 meters long.&lt;ref name="lighthouse-17may11"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lighthouse and TS Sports Make an Impact with LED Video at Portland's Jeld Wen Field|url=http://www.lighthouse-tech.com/PressReleasesDetail.aspx?id=d1b2f0c0-c2aa-483d-98b7-83a72fb6a75e&amp;c=2011|date=May 17, 2011|access-date=August 21, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909174049/http://www.lighthouse-tech.com/PressReleasesDetail.aspx?id=d1b2f0c0-c2aa-483d-98b7-83a72fb6a75e&amp;c=2011|archivedate=September 9, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the project was nearing completion, it was revealed to be $5 million over budget, making the total cost of the renovation $36 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neves|first=Randy|title=PGE Park project $5 million over budget|url=http://www.kgw.com/news/local/Cost-overruns-at-PGE-no-problem-say-Timbers-and-City-Commissioner-117284533.html|publisher=KGW|access-date=July 2, 2011|date=March 3, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117094617/http://www.kgw.com/news/local/Cost-overruns-at-PGE-no-problem-say-Timbers-and-City-Commissioner-117284533.html|archivedate=January 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement between the city and Portland Timbers owner Merritt Paulson meant that Paulson was responsible for any cost overruns larger than $1 million.

The newly renovated stadium made its début on April 14, 2011, when Major League Soccer's Timbers defeated the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], 4–2.&lt;ref name="oreg-22sep09"&gt;{{cite news|title=PGE Park would have similar capacity under soccer remodel, designers say|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2009/09/pge_park_would_have_similar_ca.html|date=September 22, 2009|newspaper=The Oregonian|access-date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announced attendance at Timbers games in 2011 was 18,627, a sell-out.

A few thousand seats were added for two games late in the 2011 season. About 2,000 seats were opened up for the 2012 season, bringing capacity up to 20,438. Following the 2012 season in which the Timbers' average attendance was 20,438, during the 2012–13 off-season the Timbers widened the pitch for the 2013 season, adding two yards on each side to achieve a width of {{convert|74|yd|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.oregonlive.com/timbers/index.ssf/2012/08/portland_timbers_to_widen_fiel.html|title=Portland Timbers to widen field for 2013 season|accessdate=January 7, 2013|first=Geoffrey C.|last=Arnold|date=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team widened the pitch by another yard in 2014, for a total pitch size of {{convert|110|x|75|yd|m}}.&lt;ref name="stumptown" /&gt;

In April 2017, the Portland Timbers unveiled a [[United States dollar|US$]]50 million renovation plan which would add roughly 4,000 new seats to the eastern side of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Timbers.com Staff | date=April 26, 2017 | title=A soccer cathedral grows: Providence Park to add approximately 4,000 new seats in modern expansion &amp;#124; Portland Timbers | url=http://www.timbers.com/post/2017/04/26/soccer-cathedral-grows-providence-park-add-approximately-4000-new-seats-modern | website=Timbers.com | access-date=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timbers' President of Business Mike Golub stated that "We felt it was imperative to see how we could transform the stadium and add capacity to both meet the demand that we have for tickets and also position the club to be viable and competitive for years to come", referencing the Timbers' current season ticket waitlist of approximately 13,000. The Timbers report that the renovation will come at no cost to the City of Portland and will bring the stadium capacity to roughly 25,000. The club partnered with Portland-based Allied Works Architecture to design the expansion, and aims to begin construction in the 2017 or 2018 off-season with the goal of having the renovated stadium ready for the 2019 or 2020 MLS season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.oregonlive.com/timbers/index.ssf/2017/04/portland_timbers_moving_forwar.html|title=Portland Timbers unveil $50 million stadium expansion plan for Providence Park|access-date=April 27, 2017|first=Jaime|last=Goldberg|date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

===Soccer===
[[File:Portland Timbers FC.jpg|thumb|right|Soccer game in the USL years, viewing the old configuration of the eastern wall]]

On August 28, 1977, the stadium was site of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]] [[Soccer Bowl '77]] between the [[New York Cosmos (1971–1985)|New York Cosmos]] and the [[Seattle Sounders (NASL)|Seattle Sounders]], the last official game of the legendary [[Pelé]]. The Cosmos won the championship.

On September 7, 1997 the stadium hosted a World Cup soccer qualifying match between the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States men's national team]] and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. A raucous capacity crowd of 27,396 saw the U.S. squad win, 1–0, on a goal by [[Tab Ramos]] in the 79th minute.

The stadium was the site of four group matches in the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999 Women's World Cup]]. The stadium also hosted two group matches, two quarterfinals, and both semifinals in the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup|2003 Women's World Cup]].

On July 1, 2009, the venue hosted the third-round match of the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]] between the [[Portland Timbers (2001–10)|Portland Timbers]] and their rivals the [[Seattle Sounders FC]].

Providence Park hosted the [[2014 MLS All-Star Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/timbers/index.ssf/2013/07/portland_to_host_2014_mls_all-.html|title=Portland to host 2014 MLS All-Star Game|last=Arnold|first=Geoffrey C.|newspaper=The Oregonian|accessdate=July 11, 2013|date=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portland to host 2014 All Star Game|publisher=StadiaDirectory.com|url=http://www.stadiadirectory.com/portland-to-host-2014-all-star-game/|accessdate=2013-07-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719164754/http://www.stadiadirectory.com/portland-to-host-2014-all-star-game/|archivedate=July 19, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baseball===

[[File:PGEPark.jpg|thumb|right|Facing south towards the Multnomah Athletic Club, during a baseball game in 2008]]

During the 1970s, the Jantzen swim wear company had a 3D model of the Jantzen girl hovering overby cable over the left field wall in its baseball configuration. The Jantzen girl was in play because it was below the top of the wall and it was hit a couple of times over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OSU in Portland|publisher=Kyle Odegard|url=http://kyleodegard.mvourtown.com/2008/03/05/osu-in-portland/|accessdate=2009-06-23}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Portland Beavers|publisher=Arcadia Publishing, page 82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4386AUmRw7IC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=jantzen+portland+civic+stadium|accessdate=2009-06-23|isbn=978-0-7385-3266-0|date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 27, 1991, the stadium received national attention when [[Vancouver Canadians]] outfielder [[Rodney McCray (baseball)|Rodney McCray]], while attempting to catch a fly ball, crashed through a wooden advertisement behind the [[warning track]] in right-center field; a real-life version of an incident in the fictional book and film, ''[[The Natural]]''. While McCray failed to make the out, he only suffered scrapes and bruises and remained in the game. Highlight reels of that play ran for weeks on cable channels such as [[CNN]] and [[ESPN]]. On August 12, 2006, the Beavers commemorated the event with a Rodney McCray Bobblehead Night, passing out [[bobblehead]]s of McCray to fans and renaming right-center field "McCray Alley".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bachman|first=Rachel|title=An effort at de-fence worth remembering|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/sports/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/sports/1155353118120820.xml&amp;coll=7|work=[[The Oregonian]]|date=August 12, 2006|accessdate=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2009, the stadium hosted the [[Triple-A All-Star Game]], with the [[International League]] stars defeating the Pacific Coast league, 6–5. The game was attended by 16,637 fans, the largest crowd for a Triple-A All-Star game since 1991, and the third largest at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triple-abaseball.com/ASGSummaries5.jsp|title=Triple-A All-Star Game Results (2008–2012)|publisher=Triple-A Baseball|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portland's [[Chad Huffman]] won the [[Triple-A Home Run Derby|Home Run Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |section=Triple-A All-Star Home Run Derby Winners |title=2017 Pacific Coast League Sketch &amp; Record Book |publisher=Pacific Coast League |year=2017 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College Football===

[[File:Multnomah Stadium football game.jpg|thumb|180px|A night football game at Providence Park (then known as Multnomah Stadium)]]

On October 27, 2007, the stadium hosted the highest-scoring game in modern [[NCAA]] [[American football|football]] history, when the [[Weber State Wildcats football|Weber State University Wildcats]] [[2007 Weber State vs. Portland State football game|defeated the PSU Vikings, 73–68]], a combined point total of 141 points. This point total eclipsed the previous NCAA record of 136 points, set in a 1968 [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] game, and the previous [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] record of 133 points, set in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/collegesports/ci_7303564 |title=Weber State football: Wildcats earn record-setting win |agency=Associated Press |date=2007-10-28 |accessdate=2007-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206060914/http://www.sltrib.com/collegesports/ci_7303564 |archivedate=February 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this record lasted only two weeks, and has been surpassed three times in all, it remains the highest-scoring game involving [[NCAA Division I]] teams.

===Concerts===
On September 2, 1957, [[Elvis Presley]] performed one of the first outdoor stadium rock concerts in music history (Presley held the first ever in Vancouver, BC, Canada just a few days earlier at Empire Stadium) there on his four-day tour of the Pacific Northwest. The concert created mass hysteria, and an estimated 14,000 people attended the concert.&lt;ref name="elvispresleymusic.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1957_september_2_portland.html|title=Elvis Presley: Multnomah Civic Stadium Portland, OR : September 2, 1957|publisher=|access-date=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scottymoore.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottymoore.net/portland57.html|title=Scotty Moore – Multnomah Civic Stadium – Portland, OR|publisher=|access-date=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 8, 2013 interview with the Portland Business Journal,&lt;ref name="elvispresleymusic.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scottymoore.net"/&gt; Portland Timbers owner Merritt Paulson expressed his desire to host summer concerts at the stadium.

===In popular culture===
In 2010, PGE Park was a filming location of Season 2 of the television series ''[[Leverage (TV series)|Leverage]]''. The episode depicts a fictional Massachusetts (where the series was set) minor league team also known as the Beavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2009/07/leverage_turns_portland_into_b.html|title='Leverage' turns Portland into 'Beantown West'|work=OregonLive.com|access-date=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bhajji.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Indian cricket team|Indian]] spinner, [[Harbhajan Singh]] was charged with racial abuse.]]

The '''Second Test''' in the [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 2007–08|Indian cricket team's tour of Australia for the 2007–08 summer]] was a controversial [[Test cricket]] match played over five days at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] from 2 to 6 January 2008. [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] won the match by 122 runs with minutes to spare at the end of the fifth day.

The match attained notoriety owing to the number of [[Umpire (cricket)|umpiring]] wrong decisions given by international umpires [[Steve Bucknor]] and [[Mark Benson]] and accusations of poor sportsmanship against both teams. The match ended in a dramatic defeat of the Indian team in the final ten minutes of the five-day match, with some commentators suggesting that the umpiring mistakes had a major impact on the course of the match.&lt;ref name=BBC7174992&gt;{{cite news | author =

| accessdate=8 January 2008
 | date=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result ensured that Australia retained the [[Border–Gavaskar Trophy]], as well as taking [[Ricky Ponting]]'s team to 16 consecutive Test wins, equalling the previous Test record, also held by Australia under [[Steve Waugh]]. The controversy was termed by parts of the media as ''Bollyline'', a reference to the 1930s controversy [[Bodyline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name, a [[portmanteau]] of [[Bodyline]] and [[Bollywood]], is tongue in cheek, but by referencing Bodyline, hints at the potential seriousness of the rift between the Indians and Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, according to [[Steve Waugh]], the affair "now has the potential to affect relations between the countries".&lt;ref name="Dileep"/&gt;

The Test itself was tightly contested, setting up a fifth (final) day in which the match could have been won by either team, but was most likely to be drawn. The match featured [[century (cricket)|centuries]] by batsmen on every day of the match. Three four-wicket hauls were achieved and [[Brett Lee]] achieved a five-wicket haul in the first innings. Both [[Anil Kumble]] and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] were, at individual points in the game, on a [[hat-trick]]. [[All-rounder]] [[Andrew Symonds]] was at the centre of much of the action, achieving 162[[not out|*]] and 61 with the bat and taking 3/51 in India's second innings. Symonds was awarded [[man of the match]].

Controversies abounded; as well as the multiple umpiring incidents that were placed in the spotlight by the narrowness of the victory, Indian spinner [[Harbhajan Singh]] was charged with racial abuse in an altercation with [[Andrew Symonds]]. Harbhajan&lt;!--He is usually referred to by his given name, as he is a Sikh.--&gt; was banned by the match referee [[Mike Procter]] for three Test matches although the charges were downgraded on 29 January 2008 to the lesser charge of using abusive language and the ban was lifted. The Indian team had earlier protested and threatened to pull out of the tour.&lt;ref name="pressrelease"&gt;{{cite press release | title=Harbhajan Singh found guilty of offence under ICC's Code of Conduct |publisher=ICC |date=7 January 2008 |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.com/media-release/2008/january/media-release20080107-7.html |accessdate=8 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The match produced bitterness on both sides and an announcement by the Indian team that they would abandon their tour, followed by dramatic intervention by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).

__TOC__

==Context==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
&lt;!-- Under construction. Basic guidelines: position of Border-Gavaskar trophy, how the series was poised, how Indo-Australian relations had weakened in recent times (how? If anything they have strengthened.), how people wanted Australia to get a challenge, how Australia was going for a record-equalling 16th straight win, other things like Tendulkar and Laxman's last visits to the SCG --&gt;
Australia had won the first Test played the previous week at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] by a margin of 337 runs, needing only four days to secure victory. Australia were seeking a 16th consecutive Test win to equal the record set by [[Steve Waugh]]'s team between late-1999 and early-2001.

The first match had led to media consternation about the appropriateness of India's batting strategy. [[Rahul Dravid]] had been promoted up the batting order from number three to open along with [[Wasim Jaffer]], while regular opener [[Dinesh Karthik]] was dropped prior to the first Test. This was done to create a middle-order vacancy for [[Yuvraj Singh]], who had scored a century in India's previous Test, when he substituted for the injured [[Sachin Tendulkar]]. During the first Test, both Dravid and Jaffer failed to pass 20 in either innings, with the former attracting attention for his particularly slow and defensive approach. This allowed the Australian bowling to assert control over the Indian batsmen from the outset and prevent them from gaining the momentum at the outset. Yuvraj also failed; he was particularly fidgety in scoring 0 and 5. The failures of the rearranged line-up prompted calls for the return of [[Virender Sehwag]], who had been taken on tour as the reserve opener. Sehwag had been dropped from the side in early-2007 and had been unproductive in recent [[Ranji Trophy]] matches in India; however, his extremely aggressive approach had been successful against Australia in the past and cricket pundits felt that he could counter-attack the Australian bowlers, rather than letting their new ball attack seize the initiative. Jaffer, Dravid and Yuvraj were all mooted as possible omissions to make way for Sehwag.
[[File:Master Blaster at work.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Sachin Tendulkar]], shown here in batting in the first Test a week prior, was expected to continue to score runs at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], where he had scored 241* on his last tour]]
Australia fielded an unchanged XI, whereas India made one change: the injured [[Zaheer Khan]] was replaced by fellow paceman [[Ishant Sharma]], a 19-year-old playing in his third Test match.

The match was preceded by speculation as to how attractive the play would be. The first Test was played on a pitch that was slow and somewhat irregular in behaviour, and the commentators were optimistic that the second Test would lead to more attractive batting, particularly from the Indians, who had amassed 7/705 and 2/211 in their previous outing in 2003–04. Tendulkar (148* in 1991–92, 241* in 2003–04) and [[V. V. S. Laxman]] (167 in 1999–2000, 178 in 2003–04) had both scored much-lauded Test centuries at the ground.

==Progress of play==

===Day one===
Australia won the toss and elected to bat on a pitch offering some moisture and grass on the first morning, but predicted to be a good batting track for days two to three and slowly develop into a spinner's track by day five. After bowling a maiden to start the day, [[R. P. Singh]] dismissed Jaques, who was trying to square cut uppishly on the back foot, for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]]. In the ninth over of the day Hayden edged Singh to the left of the wicket-keeper [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]], who was off balance and left the catch to [[slip (cricket)|first slip]] Tendulkar. Australia were 2/27 with Ponting and Hussey at the crease.&lt;ref name="CricinfoCommentary"/&gt;

An appeal for Ponting caught down the leg side by wicket-keeper Dhoni from Ganguly when he was on just 14 was turned down by umpire [[Mark Benson]] with Australia 2/55. Just prior to lunch, with Sharma hit for 10 runs off one over, the spinners [[Harbhajan Singh]] and [[Anil Kumble]] came into the attack. Harbhajan produced a stumping opportunity against Ponting in which the ball flicked the pad and was not gloved by Dhoni, running away for two [[bye (cricket)|byes]]. Ponting and Hussey survived to lunch with Ponting scoring a half century and Australia at 2/95.&lt;ref name="CricinfoCommentary"/&gt;

After lunch, Ponting began looking dangerous, scoring three fours off one R. P. Singh over before he was dismissed by Harbhajan Singh for the seventh time in his career. Australia were 3/119 at the end of the 30th over. Hussey edged the first ball of the next over to Tendulkar who took a low catch at first slip, bringing [[Andrew Symonds]] to the crease. [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] fell in the over after, not offering a shot to a straight, full ball on leg stump and being adjudged [[leg before wicket|LBW]], leaving Australia at 5/121. Singh soon drew an edge from Gilchrist to Tendulkar at first slip once again, who had to dive forward to take the catch. With only one specialist batsman remaining, Australia were at 6/135, with India having the clear upper hand.&lt;ref name="CricinfoCommentary"/&gt;

The new batsman [[Brad Hogg]] played his natural attacking game while Symonds started slowly. The two batsmen put the pressure back on India and took the score to 6/193 in the 47th over, having scored 56 off the last 10 overs. In that over by Sharma, Symonds, then on 30, nicked the ball to wicketkeeper Dhoni, however [[Steve Bucknor]] deemed the batsman not out. By tea, Australia were 6/214 with Hogg on 47 and Symonds on 38.&lt;ref name="CricinfoCommentary"/&gt;

Immediately after tea, Hogg brought up his 50 with a boundary through the gully region. In the 56th over with Australia on 6/238, Symonds was given not out by the third umpire in a close stumping call when replays suggested his back foot was clearly off the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.sports.yahoo.com/080102/43/6p4t1.html Lucky to be given not out twice: Symonds]&lt;/ref&gt; India's frustration increased as Symonds increased his tempo and overtook Hogg, who had stalled in the 70s. Australia's run-rate continued to rise, with singles and boundaries coming frequently. Symonds reached his century in the 70th over with Australia on 6/305 and Hogg on 78. Hogg was out two overs later, edging to Dravid at slip. [[Brett Lee]] came in and survived until the end of the day. 19-year-old Sharma was jeered by the crowd for losing his run-up three times in one over. Australia finished the day at 7/376.

===Day two===
India began the day hoping to dismiss the Australian lower order quickly. A breeze had picked up speed through the ground and those bowling from the Paddington End had the advantage of running in with the breeze and bowling faster. However, Lee continued to resist, reaching 50 from 100 balls in the 98th over.&lt;ref name="CricinfoCommentary"/&gt; Lee eventually fell five overs later for 59, leaving Australia at 8/421. [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]] made a quick 28 from 29 balls before falling to Kumble, [[Stuart Clark]] fell two overs later and Australia were all out for 463.&lt;ref name="CricinfoCommentary"/&gt;

Jaffer and Dravid began India's innings by successfully negotiating a tricky period of three overs prior to lunch. They did not score any runs in this period. Lee was controlled and bowled two short balls at Jaffer before trapping him with a low, swinging, yorker. Replays revealed that Lee had bowled a [[no-ball]] by overstepping the bowling mark, but the dismissal left India 1/8. Laxman and Dravid consolidated the fall of the early wicket and batted steadily, although Dravid survived a catch from a no-ball, this time from Johnson. Dravid was defensive while Laxman wristily pushed the ball to the cover and midwicket boundaries. At the end of the 15th over, a Johnson over that went for 19 runs, India were 1/69 and Laxman was on 45 from 31 balls.&lt;ref name="CricinfoCommentary"/&gt;

After his initial fast start, Laxman settled into a more sedate rate of scoring, while Dravid continued to go slowly. After one particularly long period without scoring a run, Dravid's next single was loudly greeted with ironic applause and he raised his bat to humorously acknowledge the crowd. Dravid made 55 while Laxman scored his third century in as many Tests at the SCG, but was fortunate to survive a close LBW call. The Australians took late wickets, removing both Laxman (109) and Dravid in quick succession to leave Tendulkar and Ganguly at the crease. The new pair survived to stumps with the score on 3/215.

===Day three===
The day started with Tendulkar and Ganguly in an aggressive mood with both batsmen lifting [[Brad Hogg]] for [[six (cricket)|sixes]] and scoring many boundaries. Ganguly was particularly successful, reaching 67 from 78 balls before lofting Hogg to mid-off against the run of play. Tendulkar was fortunate to survive a close LBW call. When Yuvraj replaced Ganguly at the crease, India's momentum slowed as he had difficulties dealing with the second new ball, before being trapped LBW. The lunch break came soon after, and Dhoni was quickly removed by Lee as was Kumble shortly after the resumption, leaving India seven wickets down and more than a hundred runs behind. Harbhajan joined Tendulkar and scored quickly to begin with, from a series of risky shots. He then settled down and began batting in a more orthodox manner, providing steady support to Tendulkar. Harbhajan and Tendulkar passed their half-century and century respectively after the tea break, as the eighth wicket partnership passed 100. It was after Harbhajan passed 50 that his altercation with Symonds occurred, leading umpire Benson to speak to Harbhajan. Harbhajan was then dismissed and India surpassed Australia's total. Singh and Sharma then scored 13 and 23 respectively before India were bowled out. Tendulkar finished with 154 not out and raised some eyebrows for continually taking the single from the first ball of the over and handing the strike to Singh and Sharma, the latter of whom had previously only scored 17 runs at Test level. India had a 68-run lead. Hayden and Jaques were unbeaten at stumps, having survived five overs.

===Day four===
Australia started the day slowly as the Indian pace pair of R. P. Singh and Sharma bowled accurately. After a short rain delay, the Australians began to seize the initiative and soon wiped out their first innings deficit. Approaching lunch, Jaques was out to Kumble after a lofted sweep went to the fielder on the fence. Ponting came to the crease but was caught at silly point off the first ball he faced from Harbhajan, sparking major celebrations among the Indians, including two half-commando rolls from Harbhajan.&lt;ref name="CricinfoCommentary"/&gt; After lunch, Hayden and Hussey rebuilt Australia's innings with the former scoring another hundred. Ponting acted as his runner due to an injury he collected while batting. Hayden was eventually dismissed by Kumble for 123 while attempting a reverse sweep. The very next ball Kumble claimed Clarke for a [[duck (cricket)|golden duck]]. On a hat trick, Kumble hit Symonds on the pads sparking a loud appeal which was turned down. Symonds and Hussey saw Australia to stumps with a healthy lead.

===Day five===
Australia started the final day at a slower rate than had been expected. Hussey went on to make his first century against India and finished the innings on 145 not out. Symonds also scored a half century before being caught behind trying to lift the run rate. Australia declared setting India a target of 333 to win. Some commentators, such as [[Tony Greig]], believed that Ponting had declared too late in the innings. The situation of the game meant that India needed a run rate of well over 4, highly unlikely on the fifth-day SCG pitch. Australia needed 10 wickets to win in a minimum of 72 overs.

Before lunch Jaffer fell in the first over to Lee yet again (just as in all of his innings so far on the tour). The innings resumed after lunch but India were unable to stabilise the innings, with Tendulkar and Laxman both falling cheaply, leaving Dravid and Ganguly at the crease. A crucial moment came when Dravid and Ganguly were both batting and Dravid padded up to a ball from Symonds. It was caught by Gilchrist and Dravid was given out caught behind although replays showed the ball only hitting his pad with his bat hidden behind. In the same over, the nervous Yuvraj was out for a duck, putting India five wickets down with more than a session remaining. Ganguly was the stand-out batsman scoring 51 until being adjudged caught at slips, however the replay showed that the catch was not clean.

For a period thereafter, Dhoni and Kumble began to steady India. After surviving a few appeals and inside edges that narrowly evaded the close-in fielders at the start of their innings, they began to deal with the bowling more solidly. Dhoni adopted a strategy of padding up to as many balls from the Australian spinners as possible outside off stump, but eventually, the umpire ruled against him with less than 40 minutes remaining. However, Harbhajan came in to join his captain and appeared comfortable.

With either two or three overs remaining on day five (depending on how fast the overs were bowled) the game looked certain for a draw (as India still had three wickets in hand and were 122 runs behind). But Clarke, in just his second over, took two wickets in consecutive balls to be on a hat-trick. The first ball of his second over reared after drawing a puff of dust, caught the shoulder of Harbhajan's bat and flew to Hussey at slip, and R. P. Singh padded up to his first ball and was adjudged lbw. There was an extensive delay as the last batsman Sharma took to the field with two right-handed gloves and had to wait for the correct glove to be brought out to him. This led to suspicion that the Sharma's actions were not accidental but a time-wasting ploy. Clarke took the final wicket, Sharma, in the same over, giving Australia victory. Kumble finished the day unbeaten on 45.

==Team reactions==
&lt;!-- Guidelines: The speeches at the end of the day. Include the fact that the Indian batsmen did not shake hands with umpires on their way off. Then the post-match press conference --&gt;
[[File:Ricky Ponting YM.jpg|thumb|Australian captain Ricky Ponting]]
After the match ended the stadium erupted in cheering as the Indians walked off the field, and the Australians celebrated their record-equalling win, praising [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]]. In an [[ABC Radio Grandstand|ABC radio]] interview on the ground, [[Ricky Ponting]] interrupted himself to tell Clarke to tell commentator [[Tony Greig]] that the [[declaration and forfeiture|declaration]] was timed exactly right. Gilchrist was also audibly heard shouting, "How about that declaration, Tony Greig".&lt;ref name="Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/baggygreen/content/story/329405.html|title=Kumble questions Australia's spirit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the teams later shook hands before heading into the dressing rooms, Kumble showed his displeasure by not shaking hands with the umpires.&lt;ref name="CricinfoCommentary"/&gt;

India expressed their resentment by boycotting the post-match presentation ceremony. In an on-ground interview immediately after the match had finished, [[Anil Kumble]] summed up his view of the game by stating, "Only one team is playing in the spirit of the game" – a statement that alluded to Australian captain [[Bill Woodfull]]'s leaked private admonishment of English manager Sir [[Pelham Warner]] during the [[Bodyline|1932–33 Bodyline series]]. [[Chetan Chauhan]], India's team manager said his players were "agitated and upset by&amp;nbsp;... the incompetent umpires here&amp;nbsp;... [and hoped] that they will not officiate again in the series".

Ponting was questioned over the umpiring decisions, the racism row, and the wicket of Ganguly, when he held his finger up to indicate to Benson that Ganguly has been caught. When interviewed later by Indian journalists, Ponting was upset, admonishing them for "questioning my [Ponting's] integrity".

The Indian media was skeptical of Ponting's comments about Clarke's disputed catch as well as another that he claimed to have caught but was rejected by the third umpire. Some media outlets questioned Ponting's integrity, with some Indian journalists calling for Ponting to be banned &lt;ref name="ban"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/08/2134267.htm|date=8 January 2008|title=Integrity the loser in ugly deadlock|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ban2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2008/jan/07prem.htm|date=7 January 2008|title=Why Ponting should be banned|publisher=Rediff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ban3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cricket.indiatimes.com/Former_India_stars_slam_Aussie_media/articleshow/2696599.cms|date=13 January 2008|title=Former India stars slam lopsided Australian media claim|publisher=TimesOfIndia}}&lt;/ref&gt; for appealing for what [[Sunil Gavaskar]] claimed was a grassed catch off Dhoni and claiming Clarke's grassed catch of Ganguly.

The Australian players faced much questioning as a result of the fallout of the incident. They maintained that they played hard but fair. Lee outlined the competitive spirit in the team while Ponting insisted that the only player to have been outside the spirit of the game was on the Indian side.

Gilchrist commenting on the match and responding to Kumble said:
{{quote|Though I have not seen his comments or heard him, but that's what I have been told about. I think that's not right. Definitely we don't feel so and we are not sorry about anything. I do not know what he is referring to. We obviously enjoyed the end result. Both the teams at any point of time in the game could say that they have the upper hand and the other time forth back. So it's topsy-turvy and we just grabbed it from the jaws of the draw I guess. At the end it was thrill. At some of the controversial ground, there was lot of talking points but yeah look we got through.|[[Adam Gilchrist]] – Australian vice-captain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/007200801071540.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Gilchrist defends on-field behaviour | date=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In regards to the racism issue, Ponting denied he had done anything wrong by singularly reporting Harbhajan. Ponting stated that he was obliged to refer any incidents of racism to officials, as it was widely agreed among the cricket community that racism is unacceptable.

{{quote|When I heard what had taken place with Andrew I immediately informed the umpires and then left the field at the end of the over to inform our team manager, which is what we are instructed to do.

Hussey defended his team and said:
{{quote|We go out to play as hard as we can but as fair as we can. Ricky Pointing has the support of our team and I would think, every cricketer in Australia. The two teams actually get on very well which is why I've been so shocked by the whole situation. There were a lot of contentious decisions, but the way I was brought up in the game you've got to accept the umpire's decision whether you agree with it or not and it takes a discipline to accept the decision and walk off without showing dissent. I hope Ricky and Anil [Kumble] can get together or the Australian and Indian management can get together and sort something out. I hope that we can work through this and get to Perth. For me it's been hard, uncompromising, tough Test cricket – some of the toughest Test cricket I've faced in my career.|[[Michael Hussey]] – Australian cricketer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/weve-nothing-to-be-sorry-about-hussey/2008/01/08/1199554633359.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=We've nothing to be sorry about: Hussey | date=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After widespread criticism of the Australian team across various media continued, a shocked Ponting promised to ensure that his team's conduct is not seen to be arrogant in future matches. He also said:

{{quote|I think it's important that we sit back and look at that footage. Look at our body language. See if there are areas that we can improve on. We'll look at some of the footage, its perception and the way people see things when they're off the field. I might be talking to opposition players on the field but it might be construed by people watching on television that you're in a slanging or sledging match when that's not the case. What I want is for the Australian cricket team to be the most loved and the most respected sporting side in this country. That’s always been one of my aims and it will continue to be. &lt;br/&gt;One thing I've been conscious of over the last five years I've been captain is that this team is going to be recognised as one of the all-time great Australian cricket teams. But what I've also been conscious of is making sure the guys are remembered as being good people to go along with being great cricketers. &lt;br/&gt;In the last two or three seasons especially, we've actually started to change the perception, the way in which the public see us. There have been less (players reported). We're ultra-conscious of how we play the game and the spirit of cricket which we all signed on to.|[[Ricky Ponting]] – Australian captain&lt;ref name="clean up"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/11/stories/2008011164222300.htm|title=Ponting promises to clean up the act|date=11 January 2008|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following a team meeting about the spirit of cricket and how to approach a game in which there is increased pressure, Ponting admitted the team needed to "tighten up how we [the Australians] play" although he also said "there were no glaring issues" that needed to be fixed up:

{{quote|"To be 6 for 130 and win a Test with eight or nine minutes to go on the last day, you have obviously played some great cricket, but it hasn't been mentioned very much. However, that's out of our control.

The Indian players released few statements about the issue. Kumble wrote in his column in the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' that Ponting was not willing to listen to his pleas that the issue should remain on the field. Kumble claimed that he knew through experience that such an allegation would have major ramifications both on and off the field. Tendulkar reportedly sent a text message to the BCCI saying "Harbhajan is innocent and I can assure you on this&amp;nbsp;... In this hour of crisis, the board should stand by him". Tendulkar has reportedly denied sending an SMS to [[Sharad Pawar]].&lt;ref name="Tendulkardenial"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/09/stories/2008010959542100.htm|title= Tendulkar denies sending SMS to Pawar|date=9 January 2008|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams have expressed hope that this issue would not overshadow the cricket.

==List of umpiring controversies==
While the match was set for an intriguing contest, a number of dubious umpiring decisions were made, altering the course of the game.

Much of the criticism was attached to Bucknor; "Bucknor had one of his worst matches as an umpire and, at 61, may be nearing the end of his career.  [He made]&amp;nbsp;... several errors."&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;The Times, 7 January 2008, p. 56, "India feeling hard done by as Clarke turns thrilling finale Australia's way", Geoffrey Dean&lt;/ref&gt; He had earlier also been the subject of a complaint by India for dubious decisions and inappropriate gestures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/indvaus/content/story/137816.html|title=Bucknor riles the Indians|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=24 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson "who had a good match in Melbourne, [the previous Test] did not endear himself for rejecting what looked a plumb leg-before appeal against [[Mike Hussey]]&amp;nbsp;... On 20 at the time, Hussey went on to make an [[not out|unbeaten]] 145."&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

Bucknor, from [[Jamaica]] and aged 61 at the time of the Test, was the most experienced umpire in international cricket history, having stood in a record 120 Tests, and is the only umpire to have officiated in over 100 Tests. He had also stood in 167 [[One Day International]]s including five [[Cricket World Cup]] finals up until the Sydney Test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/51237.html|title=Steve Bucknor|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mark Benson|Benson]] is from [[England]] and aged 49, is a former international and first-class player and had stood in 21 Tests and 61 ODIs up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/9074.html|title=Mark Benson|work=cricinfo|accessdate=10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both umpires were part of the ten-member [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires]].

According to [[Cricinfo]], published reports stated that as many as 8 out of 11 controversial umpiring decisions went against the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/current/story/331049.html Bucknor disappointed]&lt;/ref&gt; The major umpiring controversies were identified by Cricinfo, the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' and [[Star Cricket]] who were referring to live footage of the match:&lt;ref name="CricinfoCommentary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ausvind/engine/current/match/291352.html?innings=1;view=commentary|title=Commentary – 2nd Test: Australia v India at Sydney|author=George Binoy and Jenny Thompson|date=2 January 2008|accessdate=6 January 2008|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HTFP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaper.hindustantimes.com/ArticleImage.aspx?article=07_01_2008_001_006&amp;mode=1|date=6 January 2008|accessdate=6 January 2008|first=Kadambari|last=Murali|title=Umpires beat India, ICC bans Bhajji |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080110100351/http://epaper.hindustantimes.com/ArticleImage.aspx?article=07_01_2008_001_006&amp;mode=1 |archivedate = 10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="starsports1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti9AFeF7zlY|date=6 January 2008|accessdate=6 January 2008|title=Umpires win the match for Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="starsports2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z125uLHDlUU|date=6 January 2008|accessdate=6 January 2008|title=Umpire Goof Ups Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sourav Ganguly edged the ball to [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] at slip who was engulfed by his teammates in celebration of an apparent catch. Umpire Benson appeared unsure as to whether it carried and instead of referring to third umpire asked captain [[Ricky Ponting]] for clarification. There was a prior agreement between the teams that the fielders would be honest about whether the catch had carried. Ponting, having already consulted Clarke about the validity of the catch, raised his finger, telling the umpire that he thought the catch was cleanly taken. This event is also regarded as one of the worst umpiring decision in cricket history ever.

During Australia's previous tour of India for seven ODIs in October 2007, Symonds, the only non-white Australian player, was subjected to [[monkey chants]] from some members of the Indian crowd at the fifth ODI in [[Vadodara]].&lt;ref name="ourman" /&gt;

Before the start of the tour, Symonds had expressed his displeasure over the celebrations in India over the Twenty20 World Cup win preceding the series.&lt;ref name="sparked"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/indvaus/content/current/story/312827.html |title='We have been humble, they have got carried away' Symonds sparked by Indian celebrations |date=28 September 2007|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournament was won by India after defeating Australia in the semi finals and Pakistan in the final, and they were given a ticker-tape parade in Mumbai upon their return home.

{{quote|Something has been sparked inside of me, watching them carry on over the last few days. We have had a very successful side and I think watching how we celebrate and how they celebrate, I think we have been pretty humble in the way we have gone about it. And personally, I think they have got far too carried away with their celebrations. It has definitely sparked passion inside of us. It has certainly spiced it up as well. Something gets triggered inside of you, something is burning inside of you – it is your will for success or your animal instinct that wants to bring another team down, We have been at the top for so long, it is like someone has taken the favourite thing you own from you and you want it back.|[[Andrew Symonds]], Australian cricket player.&lt;ref name="sparked"/&gt;}}

In an interview after second ODI at [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], Harbhajan criticized the Australian team as bad losers after their defeat to India in the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup, and referred to words that he had exchanged with them in the Kochi match.

{{quote|They clearly did not like that [the Twenty20 loss to India]. They are a very good cricket side, but that does not mean that they can do whatever they want to do. They say they play the game in the right spirit, but they don't in reality. There is nothing gentlemanly about the way they play. I was responding to a lot of vulgar words that were said to me, I don't have any problem with chitchat on the field, so long as it is about the game. But when it is very personal and vulgar, that is not on. They think you cannot fight back and they do not like it when you do.|[[Harbhajan Singh]]&lt;ref name="vulgar"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/indvaus/content/story/313550.html |title=Harbhajan attacks 'vulgar' Australia |date=4 October 2007|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the Kochi match, the Indian paceman [[Sreesanth]] had several heated exchanges with Symonds when Australia were batting, and had to be pulled away from Symonds by teammates after dismissing him. However, Symonds's innings had already laid the platform for an eventual Australian victory.

The issue regarding Symonds became controversial and came to a climax during the final ODI at the [[Wankhede Stadium]] in [[Mumbai]], where four men were arrested for taunting Symonds with monkey gestures and a large proportion of the crowd booed Symonds when he came out to bat. Symonds fell for a golden duck.

It was reported in the media that Harbhajan had called Symonds a "monkey" in India, but that no further action was taken after the matter was resolved privately with a promise that it would not be repeated.&lt;ref name=bastard/&gt;

Prior to this series, the two teams made a deal with the match referees to ensure good conduct. The nature of the deal has been contested by the two sides. The Australians insist that the deal stated that there would be no racism, including calling others monkeys,&lt;ref name=bastard&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/01/11/1199988590200.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title='Bastard' not on banned words list | date=12 January 2008 | first=Chloe | last=Saltau}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harbhajan was accused of breaking his promise to Symonds. The Indian officials believed that the deal also obligated the pair to additionally avoid exchanging words.&lt;ref name="Saltaulowdown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/the-lowdown-on-the-showdown/2008/01/11/1199988590203.html|title=The lowdown on the showdown|last=Saltau|first=Chloe|date=12 January 2008|accessdate=12 January 2008|work=[[The Age]] Australia | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Justice John Hansen who carried out the appeal for Harbhajan, the pact was broken by Symonds who swore at Harbhajan at the end of the 116th over.&lt;ref name="Hearing"&gt;[http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2007-08/IND_IN_AUS/icc_commissioner_decision_30012008.pdf John Hansen's report]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harbhajan banned ===

During the third day, the controversy restarted. At the end of the 116th over of India's first innings, Harbhajan was batting with Tendulkar in a vital partnership for India, who had just lost a series of quick wickets. Lee was the bowler in that over and Harbhajan had just edged him over the slips for four. Harbhajan then tapped Lee on the backside with his bat, apparently saying "hard luck", to which Lee did not react. Symonds says he needed to stand up for Lee so in his own words, he "had a bit of a crack at Harbhajan, telling him exactly what I thought of his antics". Symonds went on to claim that Harbhajan then "shot back" by calling him a monkey.&lt;ref name="Saltaulowdown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Symondsstory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/story/329488.html|title=Symonds tells his side of the story|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|author=Cricinfo staff|date=6 January 2008|accessdate=9 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symonds stated in the appeal hearing that he believed that Test cricket was no place to be friendly to opposition players, so he spoke to Harbhajan.&lt;ref name="Hearing"/&gt; Under questioning he admitted that he had provoked the incident and used the word "fuck" among other language against Harbhajan, who stated that he then became "very angry" because of the use of this word.&lt;ref name="Hearing"/&gt;

Sachin Tendulkar, who was batting at the other end offered his inputs to the umpires, and in the ensuing hearing, and also writes in his autobiography, that he heard Symonds going after Harbhajan repeatedly in an aggressive verbal assault, even before the Brett Lee over, and after this particular incident. He said he heard Harbhajan use the north Indian swear phrase, "Teri ma ki", which translates to "your mother" in a very derogative meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/sachin-tendulkar-blasts-michael-clarke-ricky-ponting-over-monkeygate/story-e6frg7mf-1227114270530|title=Sachin Tendulkar blasts Michael Clarke, Ricky Ponting over Monkeygate|publisher=[[The Australian]]|author=Peter Lalor|date=6 November 2014|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither umpire heard the comment.&lt;ref name="NoConfirmFromUmpires"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/solpda/ukfs_sport/hi/newsid_7174000/7174122.stm?item=12032007news|title=No confirmation of Symond claims by umpires|publisher=[[BBC News]]|author=BBC staff|date=9 January 2008|accessdate=9 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the alleged exchange, commensurate with ICC protocol Ponting reported the incident to Benson and Bucknor, who later reported Harbhajan to the match referee [[Mike Procter]] on the charge of "Using language or gestures that offends, insults, humiliates, intimidates, threatens, disparages or vilifies another person on the basis of that person's race, religion, gender, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23008858-5001023,00.html?from=mostpop | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Harbhajan cited over alleged race slurs towards Symonds | date=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kumble called Ponting at the end of the third day and asked him to not press charges against Harbhajan, wanting the issue not to leave the field. Kumble claimed "Having played cricket for this long, [I knew] such an allegation would definitely spiral into what it has now. I anticipated that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/current/story/330013.html|title=Ponting turned down request – Kumble|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumble said that he asked Harbhajan why he did it and received the reply "he hadn't, Symonds did and goaded", and insisted he made no racist comment. Kumble asked Ponting whether an apology from himself for the on-field altercation, as captain, would suffice (as Harbhajan was not willing to apologise) but, according to Kumble, Ponting was "not willing to listen". Kumble believed that the offer of an apology was interpreted by Ponting as an admission of guilt, although he explained to the Australian captain that no racist remarks were made.&lt;ref name="Pontingnotlistening"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ponting was 'not willing to listen|date=11 January 2008|accessdate=11 January 2008|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/current/story/330300.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australians have had a turbulent relationship with Harbhajan. In 1998, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPxbihPKkoQ Harbhajan taunted Ponting when he dismissed him], resulting in the pair exchanging words directly in another's face, with both of them docked their match fees. In the historic [[Australian cricket team in India in 2000-01|2000–01 tour of India]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHH5Qss73WM Harbhajan became the first Indian bowler to achieve a hat trick against Australia] and also take two ten-wicket hauls against the Australians. Ponting made only 17 runs at 3.40 during the series, and was dismissed by Harbhajan on each of his five innings. During the 2007–08 particular tour, Harbhajan had claimed that he had the measure of Ponting, pointing to the fact that he has dismissed him six times in the last seven Tests. He claimed Ponting three times in the first four innings of the Australian tour.&lt;ref name="HarbhajanPonting"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22996291-2882,00.html |title=Harbhajan has my number: Ponting |last=Pierik |first=Jon |publisher=[[Herald Sun]] |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105130526/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22996291-2882,00.html |archivedate=5 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearing for the incident was initially scheduled to be at the end of the fourth day's play, but it was postponed until after the match for fear that it would aggravate or distract the players.&lt;ref name="Cricinfohearingpostponed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harbhajan hearing postponed|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/329129.html|author=Cricinfo staff|date=5 January 2008|accessdate=9 January 2008|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Procter]], who would be hearing the case, indicated that the umpires had not heard anything in relation to the allegations.&lt;ref name="Cricinfohearingpostponed"/&gt; On the evening after the end of day five, Procter, after listening to the testimony of Hayden, Symonds, Ponting and Gilchrist as well as that of Tendulkar and Harbhajan, declared that Harbhajan would be banned for three Test matches. Included in his final report were the words that "I believe one group is telling the truth", implying that Tendulkar and Harbhajan were lying in their testimonies, and that the Australian contingent were telling the truth &lt;ref name="IndiansProcter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/current/story/329742.html|title=Indians unhappy with Procter|last=Vaidyanathan|first=Siddhartha|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=9 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tit for tat ===

Australian spinner [[Brad Hogg]] was later charged with the same offense as Harbhajan for calling Indian captain [[Anil Kumble]] and vice-captain [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] "bastards", a highly offensive term in India, after the BCCI lodged a complaint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/hogg-twist-to-abuse-hearing/2008/01/07/1199554494023.html Hogg twist to abuse hearing]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was not on a blacklist submitted by the Indians to match officials before the series, in line with ICC protocol.&lt;ref name=bastard/&gt; Hogg claimed that he did not mean to insult the Indians with the term. The term "bastard" in India is taken literally as someone born out of wedlock; such people often become outcastes and are frowned upon.

The hearing for Hogg's case was to be held before Procter, and the preliminary date was set for 14 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/current/story/329815.html |title=Hogg charged for making 'offensive remark' |publisher=Cricinfo |date=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/01/07/1199554494023.html |title=Hogg twist to abuse hearing |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=7 January 2008 |first=Alex |last=Brown |author2=Chloe Saltau  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/indexn12.asp?main_variable=SPORTS&amp;file_name=sprt3%2Etxt&amp;counter_img=3|title=Hogg charged with offence|publisher=www.dailypioneer.com|accessdate=9 January 2008|last= PTI |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101233456/http://www.dailypioneer.com/indexn12.asp?main_variable=SPORTS&amp;file_name=sprt3.txt&amp;counter_img=3 |archivedate = 1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were dropped after the two captains met for peace talks along with ICC match referee [[Ranjan Madugalle]].&lt;ref name=hogg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/current/story/330850.html|title=India withdraw charge against Hogg|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BCCI suspends tour; ICC mediates ===

After two test losses, the Indian team announced on 7 January 2008 that they were discontinuing the tour pending the outcome of the appeal against Harbhajan's three match ban.&lt;ref name=bbcban&gt;{{cite news

The racism allegation caused considerable backlash from within India. Many, including BCCI chairman [[Sharad Pawar]] have equated it to an attack on the country's people itself, based on the apparent misunderstanding that lead to such an escalation. Pawar told Cricinfo "allegations of racism against a member of our cricket team is not acceptable&amp;nbsp;... We fight against racism. Our country supported anti-racism movements in South Africa."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/current/story/330296.html Pawar given power over tour future]&lt;/ref&gt; Kumble considered the allegation one that should not have been made lightly as the team is meant to be an ambassador for the country and an allegation of racism becomes an issue of honour.

ICC chief executive [[Malcolm Speed]] announced that "a commissioner will be appointed by Wednesday to hear the appeal, which could take place before the third Test starts in Perth on 16 January."&lt;ref name="Row umpire"&gt;{{cite news

Speed was quoted as saying that:

Afterwards it was announced by the ICC that an appeal could not be heard before the Third Test, so Harbhajan was free to play until then, regardless of the appeal's result. The ICC also confirmed the [[New Zealand]] High Court judge [[John Hansen (judge)|John Hansen]]'s appointment to oversee the appeal.&lt;ref name="ReutersHansen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-31312020080109|title=ICC appoints Hansen to hear Harbhajan appeal | agency=Reuters |accessdate=9 January 2008|last= [[Reuters]] | date=9 January 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January, the BCCI president [[Sharad Pawar]], clarified that the tour would not be canceled even if Harbhajan's appeal failed.&lt;ref name="nopullout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/current/story/330433.html|title=No question of a pullout – Pawar|date=12 January 2008|accessdate=12 January 2008|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January, the ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed announced that, the appeal would be heard on 29 and 30 January, after the fourth Test in Adelaide. He was quoted as saying that:

{{quote|We would have preferred the appeal to be held earlier but it was not possible. Both [[Cricket Australia|CA]] and the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] have requested the hearing to be held after the Test series for logistical reasons and, following due consideration, Justice Hansen agreed.
The reality is that it is likely to go into a second day as lawyers will be involved, so we needed to have two clear days to assign to it. With just three full days between the third and fourth Tests, we were conscious of the teams' travel arrangements and preparations for the match.&lt;ref name="AppealDate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/story/330999.html|title= Harbhajan appeal to be held after Tests|date=14 January 2008|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Harbhajan did not play in the third Test in Perth as India opted to field only one spinner, Kumble, on what was expected to be a pace-friendly surface, but India opted to recall him for the fourth Test in Adelaide while his appeal was still pending.

=== Bucknor removed ===

The BCCI called for the removal of Bucknor for the third Test in Perth, although they previously agreed not to interfere with the choice of umpire for any of the matches.&lt;ref name="BBCSport"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/7174122.stm|title=Tour at risk after Harbhajan ban|date=7 January 2008|accessdate=8 January 2008|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 8 January the ICC confirmed Bucknor would be dropped and replaced by New Zealand umpire [[Billy Bowden]],&lt;ref name="ABC 8Jan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/08/2134298.htm|title=Bucknor dropped for third Test|work=abc.net.au|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Harbhajan acquitted ===

On 28 January, after the appeal hearing at Adelaide by ICC appeals commissioner Judge [[John Hansen (judge)|John Hansen]], the racism charge on Harbhajan Singh was found to be "not proved". Harbhajan's three-Test ban was therefore lifted. However, the lesser charge (Level 2.8 offense) of using abusive language was applied and Harbhajan was fined 50% of his match fee.&lt;ref name="cleared"&gt;{{cite press release | title=Harbhajan Singh cleared of racism charges |publisher=ICC |date=29 January 2008 |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/current/story/333986.html |accessdate=29 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansen ruled a lack of sufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="friendly"&gt;{{cite press release | title=Insufficient evidence against Harbhajan – Hansen |publisher=ICC |date=30 January 2008 |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ausvind/content/story/334196.html |accessdate=30 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly perturbed by the fact the altercation stemmed from Symonds reacting angrily to Harbhajan patting Lee on the backside in recognition of a good delivery.&lt;ref name="view"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,23132961-23212,00.html |title=ICC stuff-up cleared Harbhajan |date=30 January 2008|publisher=[[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symonds' inability to conclusively say whether Harbhajan Singh had used the word monkey or a Hindi abuse, and his admission that the language did not fall under the requirements of a level 3.3 offence played a crucial part. Symonds was unable to state if he had heard Harbhajan use a term in his native tongue "teri maa ki" (an offensive Hindi term) which appears to be pronounced with an "n" and accepted that it was a possibility.

Michael Clarke's account was critical, considering that it did not coincide favourably with the rest of the Australians.

{{quote|It is not without significance that the Australian players maintain other than Mr Symonds that they did not hear any other words spoken, only the ones that are said to be of significance to this hearing. This is a little surprising in the context where there was a reasonably prolonged heated exchange. Indeed Mr Clarke went so far as to say that he did not hear Mr Symonds say anything. Given Mr Symonds' own acceptance that he initiated the exchange and was abusive towards Mr Singh, that is surprising. This failure to identify any other words could be because some of what they were hearing was not in English.|[[John Hansen (judge)|John Hansen]]&lt;ref name="friendly"/&gt;}}

Of Symonds' provocation of Harbhajan, Hansen said

{{quote|If that is his view I hope it is not one shared by all international cricketers. |[[John Hansen (judge)|John Hansen]]&lt;ref name="view"/&gt;}}

Unlike Mike Procter, who thought Tendulkar was not in a position to hear what was uttered, Hansen said "extensive video footage" establishes that Tendulkar "was within earshot and could have heard the words". According to Hansen, video replays from various camera angles showed that Tendulkar was the closest player to the conversation and was likely to have heard it. Tendulkar admitted words were spoken in both English and Hindi.&lt;ref name="Hearing"/&gt; Hansen also rejected the suggestion that the BCCI and Cricket Australia reached an agreement which he simply rubber-stamped.

{{quote|It is incorrect to suggest that there was some sort of an agreement reached between Australian and Indian cricket authorities that I simply rubber-stamped, I also wish to add that while I was aware of the media furore surrounding this matter, no-one has attempted to apply direct pressure to obtain an outcome.|[[John Hansen (judge)|John Hansen]]&lt;ref name="influenced"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/7217203.stm |title=Harbhajan judge defends decision |date=30 January 2008|publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was also critical of all parties involved in the confrontation in Sydney, saying "their actions do not reflect well on them or the game".

==International reaction==
&lt;!-- Guidelines: The public outrage, media reaction, Harbhajan's mother released a statement, the board's action. Also from other countries because some British newspapers have told their views and some players definitely have--&gt;

Former Pakistani fast bowler [[Wasim Akram]] lashed out against the "hypocritical" Australians for reporting Harbhajan, despite being known for their [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]]&lt;ref name="AkramFairfax"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/australians-cry-babies-says-akram/2008/01/07/1199554570966.html|first=Chloe|last=Saltau|title=Australians cry babies, says Akram|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=8 January 2008|publisher=[[The Age]], Australia | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite a rumoured pre-series agreement not to refer to Symonds, Australia's only dark skinned player, using the word "monkey" as Indian cricket fans had done in their recent home series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/text/articles/2008/01/05/1198950130931.html |title=Harbhajan has form, say hosts |publisher=The Age |first=Alex |last=Brown |author2=Chloe Saltau  |date=6 January 2008 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akram further attacked them by calling them the "worst sledgers" in the world and labeling them as "cry babies":

{{quote|We did not behave like cry babies and drag it to the officials&amp;nbsp;... They do it constantly and much more than anyone else, so how they can go out and complain about other teams, I don't know.|[[Wasim Akram]], former [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistani cricket]] player&lt;ref name="AkramFairfax"/&gt;}}

Indian officials further went on to claim that because "monkey" was not a derogatory word in India it was acceptable.&lt;ref name="ourman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/01/05/1198950132278.html |title=Our man seriously provoked: Indians |first=Chloe |last=Saltau |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=6 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Rashid Latif]], a former Pakistani cricketer who was accused of being a racist to [[Adam Gilchrist]] during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]], noted that Harbhajan was renowned for having temper problems :

{{quote|He has a short temper, he needs to control his emotions. He is a good guy, but he has some kind of problem with his temper. I think (Harbhajan) should have been given a warning on the field and if he does say something again, then give him a ban for two or three matches&amp;nbsp;... All of these things should stay on the field, it is better for the game.|[[Rashid Latif]], former Pakistani cricket player.&lt;ref name="Latif"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/complaint-uncalled-for-says-latif/2008/01/05/1198950130937.html|title=Complaint uncalled for says latif|date=5 January 2008|last=Pandaram|first=Jamie|accessdate=8 January 2008|publisher=[[The Age]], Australia | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Morrison (cricketer)|John Morrison]], former [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] spin-bowler accused Australians of "running off to the teacher", while his former teammate [[Dipak Patel (cricketer, born 1958)|Dipak Patel]], of Indian descent, said that he had been called "a lot worse than a monkey".&lt;ref name="morr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4349149a1823.html|work=stuff.co.nz|title=Racial taunts in the name of sport never on|author=Tony Smith|date=9 January 2008|accessdate=9 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harsha Bhogle]], an Indian commentator of the channel [[Star Cricket]] said during the commentary when the game ended:

{{quote|Australia won! But did they deserve it?{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}}}

During the Clarke's claimed catch and when Ponting held up his finger, the former Indian cricketer [[Sunil Gavaskar]] commented on air:

{{quote|Why is Mr. Benson asking a person who didn't walk off when he was caught behind at 14, and it couldn't be possible that you are lying when you are batting and true while you are fielding. That is nonsense! Utter nonsense! I am sorry Mr. Benson, you got it all wrong.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}}}

Gavaskar strongly condemned Procter, accusing him of blatant racism for "taking the 'white man's' word against that of the 'brown man'&amp;thinsp;" in handling the racism allegations and imposing the ban of three Tests on Harbhajan Singh. Gavaskar was also skeptical regarding the motivation of Australian team in reporting Harbhajan Singh, because he has dismissed Australian captain Ricky Ponting in three times in the current series. In his newspaper column to ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', Gavaskar wrote:

{{quote|Millions of Indians want to know if it was a 'white man' taking the 'white man's' word against that of the 'brown man'. Quite simply if there was no audio evidence nor did the officials hear anything then the charge did not stand. This is what has incensed the millions of Indians who are flabbergasted that the word of one of the greatest players in the history of the game, Sachin Tendulkar, was not accepted. In effect, Tendulkar has been branded a liar by the match referee.
The off spinner has denied having used the word which has caused offence and in the absence of any audio recording and most crucially with both umpires not having heard it, the charge should have been dropped straight away for lack of corroborating evidence. He wrote, "By accepting the word of the Australian players and not the Indian players, the match referee has exposed himself to the charge of taking a decision based not on facts, but on emotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/sunny-slams-ref-aussie-motives/2008/01/14/1200159286472.html|title= Sunny slams ref, Aussie motives|date=14 January 2008|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Christopher Martin-Jenkins]], chief cricket correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' in the United Kingdom defended the "righteous indignation of India's players" and suggested that the BCCI's adamance to give the issue the necessary publicity has been better for the game. Martin-Jenkins also described Australia as the "nonpareils of world sledging" and expressed the view that [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] would be less appropriate as a future captain than [[Mike Hussey]] based on Clarke's decision to stand his ground after being caught at first slip.&lt;ref name="Martin-Jenkins"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin-Jenkins|first=Christopher|title=India's sense of injustice wounded by heightened national pride|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/cricket/article3149363.ece|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=10 January 2008 | work=The Times | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former player and match referee [[Clive Lloyd]] commenting on [[Steve Bucknor]] being stood down for the next test match in a [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] interview said:
{{quote|You wonder what confidence this gives umpires. What happens now if Billy Bowden makes a few mistakes?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/7178190.stm | work=BBC News | title=Support grows for umpire Bucknor | date=9 January 2008 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Former England cricketer and current [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] commentator [[Tony Greig]], whose comments on air were criticised by Ricky Ponting stood by his observations saying:
{{quote|I stand by what I said about the declaration. If the umpires had got it right (and Rahul Dravid had not been incorrectly given out caught behind) Ricky would have been found out on the declaration.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}}}
Going on to comment on other issues of the game including umpiring and the ethics of walking, he said:
{{quote|Ponting got an edge down the leg-side and was out (but didn't walk). Then he got a bad decision for an lbw and carried on about it. There are double standards. At the same time Ponting is trying to persuade opposition captains to take his word on catches&amp;nbsp;... they are all over the place. All I can tell you is the best umpiring I have ever experienced and the best relationships between umpires and players was in England in county cricket where we had former first-class players like Mark Benson umpiring. You were considered to be a cheat if you didn't walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23025551-5001023,00.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Greig returns serve to Ponting | first=Robert | last=Craddock | date=9 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

English journalist Simon Barnes writing for ''[[The Australian]]'' believed it was too late to draw a racism line in the sand. Barnes alleged that sledging is as much part of cricket as kicking in the shins is as part of rugby.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23025204-16957,00.html|title=Too late to draw a racism line in the sand|last=Barnes|first=Simon|publisher=''[[The Australian]]''|date=9 January 2008|accessdate=10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Barnes "Australia has long promoted mental disintegration; as a result, we are facing the disintegration of the game of cricket."&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

{{quote|The Asian teams come from a culture in which politeness is a more respected thing than it is in Australia or England, but many Asian cricketers have thought it appropriate to fight back in kind. Continuing escalation is inevitable. If I called you an idiot, again and again and again, you would eventually call me a bloody fool. What would you think if I then staggered back in horror. "He called me a fool! He said bloody! This mustn't be allowed!" That is what has happened. Australia led the way in insults and now, claiming that an India player used a racist term, it is saying that rude behaviour on a cricket pitch is terrible, rotten, awful, mustn't be allowed.|Simon Barnes – ''The Australian''&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;}}

Oliver Brett of BBC Sport was sympathetic towards the Indians.&lt;ref name="Indiafriendless"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=14 January 2008|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/606/A30769914|title=India friendless in Australia|last=Brett|first=Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brett claimed that Ponting's word should not have been taken as fact by Procter as Ponting had claimed a catch that was "obviously grassed" and had raised his finger to Benson to indicate certainty that a dubious catch had been taken.&lt;ref name="Indiafriendless"/&gt;

==Reaction in Australia==
&lt;!-- Guidelines: Australian board officials, Australian players, Australian journalists --&gt;

[[Cricket Australia]] chief executive [[James Sutherland (cricketer)|James Sutherland]] defended the Australian players' behaviour, claiming that there had been a "marked improvement" in their on-field attitude and behaviour in recent years.&lt;ref name="AkramFairfax"/&gt; [[Paul Marsh]], the chief of the Australian Cricketers Association, which represents the country's first-class cricketers, believed the issues to be an instance of "[[tall poppy syndrome]]", claiming that the only reason Australia was being targeted by the media and opposition teams was that they had been dominating world cricket for too long.&lt;ref name="AkramFairfax"/&gt; Later, in a ''Sydney Morning Herald'' article, Marsh pointed out that Australia was one of the four nominees to the ICC Spirit of Cricket awards, which occurred in September 2007. Marsh also pointed out that the Hogg incident was the first ICC Code of Conduct violation by the Australian team in 13 months. None of these comments, however approach directly the subject of Aussie sledging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/01/10/1199554831780.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=A team second to none, on and off the field | date=11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Waugh]] writing for [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|''The Daily Telegraph'']] in his article titled "Epic encounter's sour aftertaste" said:
{{quote|It's a real pity this magnificent Test match will probably be remembered for all the wrong reasons – and not for the outstanding quality, pressure and the excruciating drama it ultimately provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23015170-5006069,00.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Epic encounter's bad aftertaste | first=Steve | last=Waugh | date=6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The English journalist and former captain of [[Somerset County Cricket Club]], [[Peter Roebuck]], a columnist for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'', branded Ponting as "arrogant" and insisted that he be stripped of the captaincy.&lt;ref name="Peter Roebuck"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/arrogant-ponting-must-be-fired/2008/01/07/1199554571883.html [[Peter Roebuck]] in [[Sydney Morning Herald]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If Cricket Australia cares a fig for the tattered reputation of our national team in our national sport, it will not for a moment longer tolerate the sort of arrogant and abrasive conduct seen from the captain and his senior players&amp;nbsp;... Australia itself has been embarrassed. The notion that Ponting can hereafter take the Australian team to India is preposterous&amp;nbsp;... He has shown not the slightest interest in the well-being of the game, not the slightest sign of diplomatic skills, not a single mark of respect for his accomplished and widely admired opponents.&lt;ref name="Peter Roebuck" /&gt;}}

There was support for Ponting among some quarters of the media with ''[[The Australian]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Malcolm Conn]] suggesting that he was being unfairly targeted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Former player and now coach and commentator [[Geoff Lawson (cricketer)|Geoff Lawson]] was scathing in his description of the team. Speaking to the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', he said:

{{quote|There's certainly been a lot of feeling from ex-players who think the baggy green has been disrespected. Some of these (current) players need to be spoken to. I just think a bit of counselling needs to be done with how these players perceive themselves.

[[America's Cup]]-winning yachtsman [[John Bertrand (Australian sailor)|John Bertrand]], Olympic 1500&amp;nbsp;m gold medal-winning runner [[Herb Elliott]] and world champion marathon runner [[Robert de Castella]], all members of the [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]], accused the Australian cricket team of turning sport into war and thereby damaging international relations and placing the country in a negative light. John Bertrand, the Hall of Fame chairman, went on to say that:

{{quote|We believe Australia's Test team moral compass needs to be retuned and we want Cricket Australia to know that&amp;nbsp;... We believe the No.1 rule is to show respect for your fellow competitors and currently this does not appear to be the case&amp;nbsp;... Their desire to win at all costs is beginning to blur their moral compass and it would appear that is what happening to the Australian Test team&amp;nbsp;... The fallout that we are seeing at the moment is not acceptable. It's clearly damaging international relations and clearly a lot of people are upset.&lt;ref name="hof"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,23020215-5006301,00.html?from=mostpop|work=Herald Sun|author=GLENN MITCHELL and AAP|title=Bucknor a necessary sacrifice, says ICC|date=9 January 2008|accessdate=9 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Kevin Bartlett (Australian rules footballer)|Kevin Bartlett]], former [[Australian rules football]] player, accused the Australian cricket team of bad sportsmanship towards its opponents by saying that:

{{quote|You don't treat them with contempt, you treat them with respect – and I didn't see that from the Aussies&lt;ref name="hof"/&gt;}}

[[Glenn McGrath]], a recently retired Australian cricketer who played alongside most of Ponting's men, commented upon the decision to stand down [[Steve Bucknor]] by saying:
{{quote|I think it is sad and disappointing that it gets to the stage where you have a bad game and they are calling for your head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23026742-5001023,00.html | title=Bucknor dumping 'ridiculous' says McGrath | date=9 January 2008 | agency=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The federal opposition leader in Australia [[Brendan Nelson]] defended Ponting and said:
{{quote|It was great game that had all of the qualities, and strength of, any sporting match. Ricky Ponting has a really tough job as captain of the Australian cricket team, people should get off his back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/get-off-pontings-back-nelson/2008/01/08/1199554631496.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Get off Ponting's back: Nelson | date=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Neil Harvey]], member of [[Don Bradman]]'s [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|''Invincibles'']] as well as the [[Australian Cricket Board Team of the Century]] and [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] inductee, blamed Ponting, saying that:

{{quote|Ponting should have kept his mouth shut and nothing would have happened&amp;nbsp;... It is quite unheard of for a captain to dob on someone like this and it is quite an unsportsmanlike act. I think Ponting should be chastised by Australian cricket officials for his actions.&lt;ref name="neh"/&gt;}}

[[Jeff Thomson]], the former Australian fast bowler, harshly criticised the Australians by saying that:

{{quote|The Aussies act like morons and bullies and they can't cop criticism from someone like myself. I think it was appalling that none of the Australians went over and shook Anil Kumble's hand at the end of the SCG Test. They just played up and carried on like idiots like they normally do.&lt;ref name="neh"/&gt;}}

On 10 January, following repetitive criticism of the Australian team, ''[[The Australian]]'' posted on their websites a video of the [[English cricket team in India in 2005-06#Sixth ODI: India v England .2812 April.29|sixth ODI in the 2006 English tour of India]], in which Harbhajan stands his ground after being clean bowled by [[Kevin Pietersen]], having an exchange with the bowler including swearing to him, before leaving. On the same day, [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] posted videos of the Harbhajan incident as well as an instance in which Dhoni dived to his right and claimed a catch which had bounced at the base of his glove. Channel Nine claimed there was "hypocrisy afoot" under a headline of "Holier-than-thou Indians are sinners too". In the same article it posted a 1981 video of Gavaskar ordering his partner Chetan Chauhan to leave the playing arena and stop the Test match after incorrectly being given out, in a bid to back up its argument.&lt;ref name="neh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200801091757.htm|title=Scant support for under-fire Ponting|work=The Hindu|date=9 January 2008|accessdate=9 January 2008|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indiansaresinners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=344170|title=Holier than thou Indians are sinners too|date=10 January 2008|accessdate=10 January 2008|publisher=[[NineMSN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{main|Indian cricket team in Australia in 2007–08}}
The issue was a highly volatile subject in media in both Australia and India. After the meeting of the captains prior to the third Test the teams appeared to be in better spirits, although some media outlets suggested the Australians had been trying to alter the way they play in response to the criticism and to fit in with the vague definition of the 'spirit of the game'. India won the next Test in Perth by a fair margin and drew the fourth match in Adelaide, giving Australia a 2–1 victory in the series. In the context of the series result the Sydney Test ended up being pivotal.

Before the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) assumed sovereignty over the former British crown colony of Hong Kong in 1997, the committee was named '''Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong''' and participated in 12 games (all summer) under the name just "Hong Kong".

After the 1997, Hong Kong become a special territory as a result of the earlier 1984 [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], which stipulates that, albeit being part of China, it enjoys a highly autonomous status. The [[Basic Law (Hong Kong)|Basic Law]], its constitution, guarantees the territory's right to join international organisations and events independently (such as the [[Olympic Games|Olympic games]]) that are not restricted to sovereign states, under the new name "[[Hong Kong, China]]".  If any of the Hong Kong athletes wins medal in the Olympics, the Hong Kong flag is raised during the medal ceremony; the PRC national anthem is played for any gold medalists.

'''Toy guns''' are [[toys]] which imitate [[guns|real guns]], but are designed for [[children]] to play with. Children have always had small imitations of things from the adult world and toy guns are no exception. From a hand-carved wooden replicas to factory-produced [[pop gun]]s and [[cap gun]]s, toy guns come in all sizes, prices and materials such as wood, metal, plastic or any combination thereof. Many newer toy guns are brightly colored and oddly shaped to prevent them from being mistaken for real firearms.

==Types==

'''[[Rubber band guns]]''', are toy gun used to fire one or more [[rubber band]]s (or "elastic bands"). Rubber band guns are often used in live-action games such as [[Assassins (game)|Assassins]], in which they are common and popular toy weapons. They are also common in offices and classrooms.  Rubber band guns have been popular toys that date back to the invention of rubber bands, which were patented in [[England]] on March 17, 1845 by [[Stephen Perry (inventor)|Stephen Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[File:Cap gun.jpg|thumb|An orange-tipped cap gun with its hammer drawn back]]
'''[[Cap gun]]s''', cap pistol, or cap rifle are toy guns that creates a loud sound simulating a gunshot and a puff of smoke when a small percussion cap is exploded. Cap guns were originally made of cast iron, but after World War II were made of zinc alloy, and most newer models are made of plastic.

'''[[Modelguns|Model guns]]''' are Japanese full-size toy guns that highly replicate the appearance, design and operation of the real ones but cannot shoot any projectile. It comes as either ignition models (very sophisticated type of cap guns) or non-ignition dummy models. Both are subject to the strict Japanese Gun Control Law for identification and to prevent possible modification.

'''[[Theatrical properties|Prop guns]]''' are toy guns that have to look real guns. They are commonly used in movies, TV show and other theatrical performances.

'''[[Pop gun]]s''' (also written as '''popgun''' or '''pop-gun''') is a toy gun that was made by American inventor Edward Lewis and uses [[air pressure]] to fire a small tethered or untethered [[projectile]] (such as [[cork (material)|cork]] or [[Polystyrene#Solid foam|foam]]) out of a barrel, most often via [[piston]] action though sometimes via spring pressure. Other variants do not launch the obstruction, but simply create a loud noise.&lt;ref name="Magazines1912"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_90DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA149|accessdate=4 June 2013|date=July 1912|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=1–|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism consists of a hollow cylindrical [[gun barrel|barrel]] which is sealed at one end with the projectile and at the other with a long-handled [[plunger]]. In this type, the plunger is rapidly forced down the barrel, building up internal air pressure until the projectile is forced out with the "pop" sound that lends the toy its name.

[[File:Space Pilot X Ray Gun made by Taiyo.jpg|thumb|Space Pilot X Ray Gun]]
'''[[Ray guns]]''' are a science fiction particle-beam weapon that fires what is usually destructive energy. They have various alternate names: ray gun, death ray, beam gun, blaster, laser gun, laser pistol, phaser, zap gun, etc. In most stories, when activated, a raygun emits a ray, typically visible, usually lethal if it hits a human target, often destructive if it hits mechanical objects, with properties and other effects unspecified or varying. Toy ray guns often have mechanical component that spark, light-up and make a sound effect.

[[File:Gerald-G-Water-Gun.svg|thumb|left|Cross section of a typical water gun]]
'''[[Water guns]]''' are a type of toy gun that uses a verity of methods to shoot water. Many early small water guns used the same trigger based pumping mechanism used for [[spray bottle]]s. In this type of device, the trigger actuates a positive displacement pump shaft. With the aid of two [[check valve]]s, often using small [[Ball (bearing)|ball]]s, fluid is drawn into the pump from a reservoir, then forced out the nozzle upon squeezing the trigger. The simplicity of the spraying mechanism allowed these toys to be manufactured cheaply, and allowed the majority of the body to be used as the reservoir. The primary limitation with this design is the volume of water that can be effectively moved per pump. Increasing pump volume would require more user effort to push the fluid out, making larger designs impractical. However, this technology remains widely used today both in spray bottles as well as small water guns that can be found in a wide variety of shapes and colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinasnet.nl/Watergun.HTML |title=Digital Water Gun Museum |publisher=Sinasnet.nl |date=2001-08-15 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Tracer gun]]s''', sometimes known as a '''disc gun''', is a kind of toy gun made of durable plastic.  The toy shoots lightweight plastic discs roughly the size of a penny.  The discs used as ammunition for these guns are often sold with the label "Jet Discs."  The firing mechanism is a spring, The [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]] holds 20 "discs."  Range is about 10 feet, and even then, accuracy is far from dependable. The trigger requires some force. The firing sound is loud, low, and distinctive. Oftentimes the trigger will become loose and will take multiple attempts to shoot.

'''[[Nerf guns]]''' are toy guns made by [[Hasbro]] that fires foam [[darts]], discs, or foam balls. The term "Nerf gun" is often used to describe the toy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/toys/4311795 |title=The Top 10 Nerf Guns of All Time |author=Pinkerton, Lindsey |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is often used as a [[Genericised trademark|blanket term]] for any foam dart blaster, regardless of whether or not it has the [[Nerf]] brand name. Nerf blasters are manufactured in multiple forms, including [[pistol]]s, [[rifle]]s, and [[light machine gun]]s. The first Nerf blasters emerged in the late 1980s with the release of the Nerf Blast-a-Ball&lt;ref&gt;[http://nerfguns.org/nerf-blast-a-ball Nerf Blast-a-Ball]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Arrowstorm.

[[File:Bi-3681.jpg|thumb|left|Airsoft M4A1 replica]]
'''[[Airsoft guns]]''' are [[replica]] weapons used in [[airsoft]] sports.  They are essentially a special type of very low-power [[smoothbore]] [[air gun]]s designed to shoot [[airsoft pellets|non-metallic spherical projectiles]] often colloquially (and incorrectly) referred to as "[[BB (ammunition)|BB]]s", which are typically made of (but not limited to) [[plastic]] or [[biodegradable polymer|biodegradable]] [[resin]] materials.  Airsoft gun powerplants are designed to have low [[muzzle energy]] ratings (generally less than 1.5 [[Joule|J]], or 1.1 [[Foot-pound (energy)|ft⋅lb]]) and the pellets have significantly less [[penetration (weaponry)|penetrative]] and [[stopping power]]s than conventional air guns, and are generally safe for [[competitive sport]]ing and [[recreation]]al purposes if proper [[protective gear]] is worn.

'''[[Light gun]]s''' are [[pointing device]]s for [[computer]]s and a [[Game controller|control device]] for [[arcade game|arcade]] and [[video game console|video games]], typically shaped to resemble a [[pistol]]. Modern screen-based light guns work by building an optical sensor into the gun, which receives its input from the light emitted by on-screen target(s). The first device of this type, the [[light pen]], was used on the [[Whirlwind (computer)|MIT Whirlwind]] computer.

[[File:PaintBallMarker.jpg|left|thumb|Spyder VS2 Paintball Marker Gun]]
'''[[Paintball gun]]s''' , paint gun, or marker gun, is the main piece of [[paintball equipment]] in the sport of [[paintball]]. Markers use an expanding gas, such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[compressed air]], to propel [[Paintball equipment#Paintballs|paintballs]] through the barrel and quickly strike a target. The term "marker" is derived from its original use as a means for [[forestry]] personnel to mark trees and [[ranchers]] to mark wandering [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paintball-markers.net/faq.htm|title=FAQ ; Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=September 25, 2010|publisher=Paintball Markers, The}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/125655/splat__south_sound_plays_host_to_some_of_the/ |title=SPLAT! ; South Sound Plays Host to Some of the Best in the World of Paintball |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |publisher=News Tribune, The |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715171911/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/125655/splat__south_sound_plays_host_to_some_of_the/ |archivedate=July 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1114400/1/index.htm|date=December 6, 2004|title=Who Thought This Was A Good Idea?|author=Gaines, Charles|accessdate=5 March 2010|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:サバイバーショット初期型.jpg|thumb|Laser tag gun and sensor]]
'''[[Laser tag|Laser tag gun]]''' is a [[tag (game)|tag]] game played with toy guns which fire [[infrared]] beams. Infrared-sensitive targets are commonly worn by each player and are sometimes integrated within the arena in which the game is played. Since its birth in 1979, with the release of the Star Trek Electronic Phasers toy manufactured by the South Bend Electronics brand of [[Milton Bradley]], laser tag has evolved into both indoor and outdoor styles of play, and may include simulations of combat, role play-style games, or competitive sporting events including tactical configurations and precise game goals. Laser tag is popular with a wide range of ages. When compared to [[paintball]], laser tag is painless because it uses no physical projectiles, and indoor versions may be considered less physically demanding because most indoor venues prohibit running or roughhousing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''[[Drill purpose rifle|Dummy guns]]''' have been historically used by police and military organizations for training purposes. During [[World War II]], [[Parris Manufacturing Company]] provided over 2 million accurate copies of the [[M1903 Springfield]] rifles, the MK 1 USN Dummy Training Rifle to the [[U.S. armed forces]]. After the war they continued manufacture and sell their replicas as toy guns. As well as smaller sized models for children that featured a working bolt with a dummy bullet, leather sling, the clicker action, and a smaller rubber bayonet similar to the M1 bayonet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parrismfgco.com|title=Military Toy Guns &amp; Western Toy Cap Guns For Sale - Parris Manufacturing Co.|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also used to train soldiers in various ceremonial practices that differ when soldiers are armed. For example, standing [[at attention]] requires a different stance and set of movements when the soldier has a rifle in-hand.

==Popularity and proliferation==
[[File:RBGPooma1.jpg|thumb|left|Handmade toy rubber-band gun]]
Children have always had small imitations of things from the adult world and toy guns are no exception. From a hand-carved wooden replica to factory-produced [[pop gun]]s and [[cap gun]]s, toy guns came in all sizes, prices and materials from wood, to metal, to plastic or any combination thereof.

With the influence of [[Hollywood]] and [[comic strips]], [[tie-in]]s could make an ordinary toy gun a major [[bestseller]]. In the 1930s [[Daisy Outdoor Products]] came out with a [[Buck Rogers]] Rocket Pistol (1933), Disintegrator Pistol (1934), and Liquid Helium Pistol (1935) that sold in record numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daisymuseum.com|title=Daisy Museum|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jo-Jo0736.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Dick Tracy Rapid-Fire Tommy Gun]] 
[[Mattel]] had used [[television advertising]] to sell their "[[burp gun]]" on ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' in the mid-1950s to great effect. In 1959 Mattel sponsored their own television show [[Matty's Funday Funnies]] with their [[trademark]] little boy "Matty" showing cartoons and advertising their products. [[Mattel]] toys came out with [[Dick Tracy]] weapons in 1960 that were [[state of the art]]. Not only could the "Dick Tracy Crimestoppers" have a realistic [[snubnosed revolver]] in a shoulder [[holster]], but [[Mattel]] also boosted junior law enforcement [[firepower]] with a [[Dick Tracy]] cap firing [[Thompson submachine gun|tommy gun]] that fired a burst of 6 caps ''automatically'' when the M-1 Thompson-style bolt was pulled back. One commercial featured [[Billy Mumy]] demonstrating the weapons to his father prior to watching ''Dick Tracy'' on TV. [[Mattel]] also came up with a "Dick Tracy Water Jet Gun" that was a miniature replica of a police [[pump action]] [[shotgun]] that fired caps when you pulled the trigger ''and'' squirted water when you pumped the slide. When the [[Dick Tracy]] craze faded the same two weapons were reissued in [[military camouflage]] as [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] "Guerrilla Fighter" weapons. (see [[United States Army Special Forces in popular culture]]). [[Mattel]] later issued the same [[tommy gun]] in its original colours as a ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' [[tie-in]] complete with ape mask.

[[File:Spring operated gun toys.JPG|thumb|left|Cap guns]]
In the mid-1960s, Multiple Toymakers/Multiple Plastics Corporation (MPC) came out with [[James Bond]]'s [[attaché case]] from ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''. [[Topper Toys]] replied with a copy called "Secret Sam" that featured a toy gun that fired plastic bullets ''through'' the [[attaché case]] and had a working camera that outsold 007's kit. MPC toys replied with a "B.A.R.K" - "Bond Assault and Raider Kit" an [[attaché case]] that opened up to display a firing [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] and a rocket shooting [[pistol]]. MPC also provided a "Bond-O-Matic" [[water pistol]]. Bond's [[television]] competition [[The Man From U.N.C.L.E.]] had their pistol with attachments that turned it into a rifle made by both the [[Ideal Toy Company]] in the US and the [[Lone Star Toys]] company in the United Kingdom. Mattel came out with a series of "Zero-M" secret-agent weapons such as a camera turning into a pistol and a radio turning into a rifle demonstrated by a juvenile Agent Zero M played by [[Kurt Russell]].

[[File:StormTrooper Blaster.jpg|thumb|left|Star Wars Stormtrooper E11 Blaster]]
Perhaps the ultimate toy weapon was the 1964 [[Topper Toys]] [[Johnny Seven OMA]] (One Man Army) where an exciting [[television commercial]] showed one little boy using each of the seven weapons of the gun to wipe out a neighborhood full of children armed only with ''ordinary'' toy guns. Though an amazing seller, the ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' [[television program]] refused to air the advertisement. The proliferation of toy weapons was satirized in the "Our Man in Toyland" episode of ''[[Get Smart]]''.

In the 1970s, the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[media franchise]] provided new [[laser blaster]] and [[lightsabers]] produced by [[Kenner]] Toys.

==Toy gun control==
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Imitation M-16.jpg|thumb|The toy/imitation gun on top, below is a real gun.]]

Toy guns can cause harm like many objects not under proper supervision. Unlike most other toys though, much of the danger of these toys is related to mistaking a toy gun for a real gun or vice versa. For example:

*a [[robber]] or other [[criminal]]s might threaten people with a toy gun.
*people might call the police, flee, panic, or attempt to overpower someone carrying a toy gun.
*[[police officer]]s and [[Concealed carry|armed citizens]] might mistake someone carrying toy gun for a [[Murder|killer]] carrying a real gun, and shoot them.
*a child might play with and fire a real gun confusing it for a toy gun.

===United States===
Toy guns were temporary removed from the [[Sears Roebuck]] 1968 [[Christmas]] catalog after the assassinations of [[civil rights|civil rights leader]] [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[U.S. Senator]], former [[United States Attorney General]], and [[presidential candidate]] [[Robert Francis Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sifakis, Carl ''Encyclopedia of Assassinations: Revised Edition'' Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; However, they returned to the [[Sears catalog]] the following year.

[[File:JetDiscTracerGun.RFDS3816.jpg|thumb|Brightly colored Jet Disc Tracer Gun]]
Beginning in the 1970s, American gun control advocates called for federal government to regulate and/or ban the manufacture and sale of toy guns. These calls were countered by toy industry groups, who preferred to set their own standards. In 1973, the newly formed [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]] received petitions and letters from consumers, asking the commission to institute mandatory safety standards for the design of toy weapons. These calls for action were repeated in 1975. However, the trade association representing the toy weapon manufacturers also contacted the CPSC, asking them to delay until the industry developed their own set of voluntary standards. The voluntary guidelines that were published over the next few years emphasized the use of warning labels on packaging and instructions, rather than mandating safety standards for the design of projectile toys. The Consumer Product Safety Commission rejected further petitions to regulate toy weapon manufacture in 1981 and 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Swartz |first1=Edward M. |title=Toys That Kill: Make Sure Your Child Is Safe |date=1986 |publisher=Random House Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0394746074 |pages=24–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Department of Commerce]] prohibited the manufacture, sale, or shipping of toy guns unless they have an orange tip or are entirely brightly colored. The regulation does not prohibit end-users from modifying the toys.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/15/part-1150&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Walmart (the largest single retailer in the United States) announced that they would stop selling certain types of toy guns.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"&gt;https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/mar/1/walmart-bans-sales-toy-guns/ Walmart dances with insanity and bans toy guns. By Cheryl K. Chumley. The Washington Times. Thursday, March 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  “We are also removing items from our website resembling assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys,” the company said in a statement.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"/&gt;

====Laws====
[[File:Toy Gun being held in car with legs in background.jpg|thumb|Toy gun with an orange barrel, brightly colored exterior and transparent construction]]

In the United States, federal law and regulations indicate that all toy guns transported or imported into the country must have a 6mm-wide blaze orange tip or a blaze orange stripe 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) thick on both sides of the barrel. However, this is not required by federal law for airsoft and paintball. Part 272 of [[Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] on foreign commerce and trade (15 CFR 272) states that "no person shall manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm" without approved markings; these may include an orange tip, orange barrel plug, brightly colored ([[safety orange]]) exterior of the whole toy, or transparent construction.

[[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Chicago]], and parts of [[Michigan]] have completely banned airsoft guns.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Chicago goes even further with their mandates. It is considered a crime to wield a look-alike or replica gun (e.g., toy gun, airsoft gun) in public. If a toy gun or replica gun is used to commit a crime in Chicago, then that person is treated as though they had actually used a real firearm.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===United Kingdom=== 
There is a controversy as to whether or not toy guns are appropriate for children to play with. Some people believe they can encourage [[violence]]. In 2007, the British [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] (which existed between 2007 and 2010) has advised young boys be encouraged to play with toy guns, as it will encourage them to learn and foster their development.&lt;ref name="scotsman.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/Boys-39can-learn-healthy-lessons.3627157.jp|title=Boys 'can learn healthy lessons from toy guns'|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the National Union of Teachers in England has criticised this advice, arguing that toy guns "symbolise aggression" and that encouraging boys to play with them fosters gender stereotypes.&lt;ref name="scotsman.com"/&gt;

'''''Wild &amp; Crazy Kids''''' was an American television game show in which large teams, usually consisting entirely of children, participated in head-to-head physical challenges on [[Nickelodeon]] (as well as [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] in Canada). The show lasted for three seasons from 1990 until 1992 for a total of 65 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Bokks|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wild &amp; Crazy Kids'' starred three teenage co-hosts with [[Omar Gooding]] and [[Don Jeffcoat|Donnie Jeffcoat]] (seasons 1–3), Annette Chavez (now Annette M. Lesure) in season 1 and Jessica Gaynes in seasons 2 and 3.

In 2002, a revival was produced which lasted ten episodes and aired on Nickelodeon from July 29 to October 7, 2002. It was hosted by [[Mati Moralejo]] of [[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids]].

==Games==
Each episode consisted of three games with one host emceeing each game. The teams were identified by the color of the shirts they wore, which varied from show to show (see below). The games varied in style; many were take-offs on [[playground game]]s, [[sports]] with unusual rules added, or messy games involving [[pie]]s or [[Slime (You Can't Do That on Television)|slime]] (the latter was referred to as "blap" beginning in season three). Occasionally, the show taped special episodes at a [[theme park]] such as [[Raging Waters]], [[Wild Rivers (water park)|Wild Rivers]], and [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]].

===Take-offs on sports===
* The most often repeated (once per season) game was ''Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby''. The game consisted of two teams (one of kids and one of adults) batting in three innings. The kids would attempt to hit home runs off of pitched balls (temporary and closer fencing was put up); any ball that did not leave the field in fair territory was as an out. Once the kids had three outs, the adults would bat. During their half-inning, a grownup would have up to three chances to hit home runs off a batting tee; however, the adult was first required to hold his bat upright against his forehead and spin around it three times; furthermore, each adult would only get thirty seconds to hit the balls. Three adults would bat every half-inning. Donnie Jeffcoat, incidentally, hosted the game all three times.
* ''Three-Legged Soccer'', where kids were tied at the ankle like in a three-legged race.
* ''Splash Football'', where a quarterback [[Rodney Peete]] would throw footballs to kids jumping off a [[Springboard|diving board]] and into a pool.
* ''Bumper Boat Lacrosse'', played in [[bumper boats]].
* ''Donkey Basketball'', played with kids on [[donkey]]s.

===Playground games===
* A giant game of [[Simon Says]] which looked more like a comedy routine by leader, Brian Seeman.
* [[Red light/Green light]], retitled ''Red Pie/Green Pie'', where if a child was caught trying to advance after the call of "red light," they hit them self with a pie. If they reached their goal, they hit one of their parents with the pie.
* [[Tag (game)|Cops and Robbers]] played on the set of the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' Spectacular at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].
* A [[Tug of War]] pitting three professional wrestlers against a team of kids. The wrestlers would face-off against a growing number of kids each round, starting at one and then going to all fifty kids.

===Other games===
* A massive game of [[Twister (game)|Twister]].
* ''Human [[Space Invaders]]''.
* ''Human [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]'', where the spaces selected by the players had navy beans dumped on them (as well as any participant serving as the "ship" in that space.)

==Pilot==
A pilot was shot in 1989, hosted by Matt Brown (who co-hosted ''[[Don't Just Sit There]]'' on Nickelodeon), Leslie Hibbard and [[Cory Tyler]].

==Guest appearances==
During the first and second seasons, there were occasionally adult celebrity guests, and one of Season 2's final episodes held a kids and teens celebrity slide competition game at Raging Waters in San Dimas, California to raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.  The entire third season in 1992 featured at least one (and sometimes more) kid celebrity guest(s) every episode. Guests were people like actor and former bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Lark Voorhies]] from ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'', [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] from ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', [[Ashley Johnson]] from ''[[Growing Pains]]'', and [[Michael Fishman]] from ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''. A young [[Tobey Maguire]] appeared on the show long before he was famous, promoting the short-lived [[Fox Network|Fox]] sitcom ''[[Great Scott! (TV series)|Great Scott!]]''. Other appearances include:
* [[Marc Summers]] from ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]'' who appeared in 1990 in a special episode titled "''Double Dare'' vs. ''Wild &amp; Crazy Kids''." He also appeared the following year to pitch in "Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby: The Sequel."
* [[California Angels]] pitcher [[Scott Bailes]] pitched the first "Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby" and [[Bruce Hurst]] of the [[San Diego Padres]] pitched the third and final installment.
* [[Detroit Lions]] quarterback [[Rodney Peete]] appeared on the premiere episode throwing footballs to kids jumping into a swimming pool.
* [[Michael Bower]], [[Venus DeMilo]] and [[Danny Cooksey]] from the Nickelodeon series ''[[Salute Your Shorts]]'' appeared on one of the final episodes. This show pitted two teams—one headed by the ''Salute Your Shorts'' crew and the other headed by the three ''Wild &amp; Crazy Kids'' co-hosts—in an all day showdown.
* Olympic skier [[Bode Miller]] appeared on the 2002 revival.
* [[Daryl Sabara]] and [[Alexa Vega]] of the ''[[Spy Kids]]'' movies appeared on the revival.
* [[Brandon Call]] was in season 2, and as payback for his Wild &amp; Crazy Kids shirt being in the Goo Pool with shorts and shoes, he took Donnie's shirt, Omar's shorts and Jessica's shoes and ran off to put them into the Goo Pool with the hosts chasing after him.

==Production==
The show was executive produced by Woody Fraser, and aired 65 episodes from July 4, 1990, to December 1, 1992. Reruns aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from December 2, 1992, to February 28, 1999, before moving to [[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids]] on March 1, 1999 to December 31, 2007. It was sporadically shown on [[TeenNick]] afterwards. It was produced by Woody Fraser Productions in association with Nickelodeon and [[Alan Landsburg Productions|Reeves Entertainment Group]].
