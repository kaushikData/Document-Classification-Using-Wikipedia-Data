'''383 Madison Avenue''' is an office building owned and occupied by [[JP Morgan Chase]] in [[New York City]] on a full block bound by [[Madison Avenue]] and [[Vanderbilt Avenue]] between East 46th and 47th Streets. Formerly known as the '''Bear Stearns Building''', it housed the world headquarters of the now-defunct [[Bear Stearns]] from the building's completion until Bear's collapse and sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2008. The building now houses the New York offices for [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.|J.P. Morgan's investment banking division]], which formerly occupied [[277 Park Avenue]]. Both 383 Madison and 277 Park are adjacent to JPMorgan Chase's world headquarters at [[270 Park Avenue]]. The building changed hands in 2008 during JP Morgan's takeover of Bear Stearns. On their second-quarter 2008 conference call, JP Morgan estimated the building's value at $1.1 to $1.4&amp;nbsp;billion.

A night time photograph of the building taken at a steep angle from its base appears on the cover of [[William D. Cohan]]'s book, ''[[House of Cards (Cohan book)|House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street]]'' (2009).

==Architecture and design==
Designed by [[David Childs]] of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] LLP, it is 755&amp;nbsp;ft (230&amp;nbsp;m) tall with 47 floors. [[Hines Interests]] managed the development process for Bear Stearns. It was completed in 2001 and opened in 2002, at which time it was, by some reports, the 88th tallest building in the world. The building has approximately 110,000 rentable square meters (1,200,000 sq ft).

The building has an [[octagon]]al tower that rises out of a rectangular base to a 20&amp;nbsp;m (70&amp;nbsp;ft) crown made of glass which is illuminated at night.

The building's visually decorative design differs from the conventional functionalist style of neighboring office buildings, and hence has proven unpopular with some critics. ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' said, "This is a building you wouldn't want to get anywhere near at a cocktail party. Dressed nearly head to toe in dour granite, and geometrically proper, it's stiff to the point of pass-out boredom. Out of character with SOM's (Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill's) current work, the design recalls the firm's unfortunate postmodern interlude a decade ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/arts/architecture/reviews/5815/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051112201126/http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/arts/architecture/reviews/5815/ |archivedate=2005-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 72-story tower proposed by [[G&amp;nbsp;Ware Travelstead]] for the site during the 1980s was never built. The building (also being referred as Travelstead Tower&lt;ref&gt;http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=8332&lt;/ref&gt;) was designed by [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]].

'''3rd Street''' in [[Los Angeles]] is a major east–west thoroughfare. The west end is in downtown [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] by [[Santa Monica Boulevard]], and the east is at [[Alameda Street]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles|downtown]] Los Angeles, where it shares a one-way couplet with 4th Street. East of Alameda it becomes 4th Street, where it heads to [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], where it turns back into 3rd Street upon crossing Indiana Street. 3rd Street eventually becomes Pomona Boulevard in [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]], where it then turns into Potrero Grande Drive and finally turns into Rush Street in [[Rosemead, California|Rosemead]] and ends in [[El Monte, California|El Monte]].&lt;ref name="Map"&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Main+Street+and+3rd+Street,+Los+Angeles&amp;sll=34.053299,-118.243425&amp;sspn=0.00784,0.015836&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.04953,-118.24585&amp;spn=0.00784,0.015836&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr=map&amp;ct=image Exact location of East 3rd Street in Downtown Los Angeles]&lt;/ref&gt;

3rd Street passes along the south side of [[The Grove (Los Angeles)|The Grove]] and "The Original" Farmers Market at [[Fairfax Avenue]], near the headquarters of The [[Writers Guild of America, west|Writers Guild of America]], West. There are also many other restaurants, [[boutiques]], and antique stores on this specific strip of 3rd Street, which is less upscale and more relaxed than nearby [[Robertson Boulevard]] and [[Melrose Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zappa |first=Moon Unit |title=ONE STREET AT A TIME; Positively Third Street |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E6D91338F93BA25752C1A9679C8B63 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2001-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3rd Street is parallel to two other major thoroughfares, [[Wilshire Boulevard]] to the south and [[Beverly Boulevard]] to the north. It is four lanes wide east of [[Doheny Drive]], and it passes through the same communities as Wilshire Boulevard.

'''Alfred Beit''' (15 February 1853 – 16 July 1906) was a British gold and diamond magnate in South Africa, and a major donor and profiteer of infrastructure development on the African continent. He also donated much money to university education and research in several countries, and was the "silent partner" who structured the capital flight from post-Boer War South Africa to [[Rhodesia (region)|Rhodesia]], and the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], named after his employee, [[Cecil Rhodes]].

== Life and career ==
[[Image:Laura Beit00.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs Laura Beit (Alfred and Otto Beit's mother), by [[Leopold Graf von Kalckreuth|Leopold von Kalckreuth]]]]
Born and brought up in [[Hamburg]], [[German Confederation|Germany]], he was the eldest son and second of six children of an affluent Jewish-German citizen of Hamburg. His younger siblings included [[Otto Beit]].   Alfred Beit was an unpromising scholar and was apprenticed to [[Jules Porgès]] &amp; Cie, the Amsterdam diamond firm where he developed a talent for examining stones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Meredith |title=Diamonds, Gold, and War: The British, the Boers, and the Making of South Africa |location=New York |publisher=PublicAffairs |year=2007 |isbn=9781586484736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beit made his first fortune in property speculation.  Responding to a demand for business premises, he bought a piece of land and built twelve corrugated iron sheds for offices and rented eleven out monthly and kept one for himself.  Twelve years later he sold the land for a considerable profit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Beit was sent to [[Kimberley, South Africa]] in 1875 by his firm to buy diamonds—following the diamond strike at Kimberley. He became a business friend of [[Cecil Rhodes]] through his role in the Kimberley Central Company.  Beit was captivated by Rhodes' talk of 'big schemes'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Together, they proceeded to buy out digging ventures and to eliminate opposition such as [[Barney Barnato]]. He rapidly became one of a group of financiers who gained control of the diamond-mining claims in the Central, Dutoitspan, and [[De Beers]] mines. Rhodes was the active politician and Beit provided a lot of the planning and financial backing.

Beit's diamond interests were mainly concentrated on Kimberley mine.  He focused his main attention on the Kimberley Central Company aiming to expand its interests.  He had a major role in the rise of Kimberley Central Company.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

In 1886 Beit extended his interests to the newly discovered goldfields of the [[Witwatersrand]] and met with great success. In his business ventures there he made use of financiers [[Hermann Eckstein]] and [[Joseph Benjamin Robinson|Sir Joseph Robinson]]. He founded the Robertson Syndicate and the firm of Wernher, Beit &amp; Co. He imported mining engineers from the USA and was among the first to adopt deep-level mining. Rhodes purportedly was granted concessions by [[Lobengula]], as a result of which Beit founded the [[British South Africa Company]] in 1888.

Beit became life-governor of De Beers and also a director of numerous other companies such as Rand Mines, Rhodesia Railways and the Beira Railway Company.

In 1888 Beit moved to London when he felt he was better able to manage his financial empire and support Rhodes in his Southern African ambitions. Beit moved into Tewin Water, [[Tewin]], near [[Welwyn]], a large Regency house with Victorian additions and 7,000 acres (28&amp;nbsp;km²), and a few miles away [[Julius Wernher]] bought [[Luton Hoo]], with 5,218 acres (21.1&amp;nbsp;km²).  In the 1890s, he had a mansion built in [[Park Lane]] – [[Aldford House]].

Inspired by Rhodes' imperialist vision,{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} he took part in the planning and financing of the unsuccessful [[Jameson Raid]] of late 1895 which was intended to trigger a coup in the [[South African Republic]] in the Transvaal. As a result of this debacle, Rhodes resigned as Prime Minister, and both he and Beit were found guilty by the House of Commons inquiry. Beit was obliged to resign as director of the Charter Company, but was elected vice-president of the British South Africa Company a few years later. With the death of Rhodes in 1902, Beit, as one of the trustees, helped control the enormous estate, currently being helped by the [[Oppenheimer]] family of [[De Beers]] and [[Anglo American plc|Anglo-American]].

Beit never married and had no children. He died at Tewin Water on 16 July 1906 after seeing a rapid deterioration in his health. He left an estate of £8,049,886 (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK-GDP|0.008049886|1906|r=2}} billion in {{Inflation-year|UK-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|UK-GDP}}).&lt;ref name="jewishtopwealth" /&gt;

== The Beit Trust and other donations ==
[[Image:ImperialCollegeLondon.jpg|thumb|Imperial College, London]]
During his lifetime, Beit made generous donations for scientific work and education. In 1905 he founded a chair of colonial history at the [[University of Oxford]], which is now the ''[[Beit Professor of Commonwealth History|Beit Professor of History of the British Commonwealth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford, Faculty of History.

In his will he set up the [[Beit Trust]] through which he bequeathed large sums of money (£1,200,000) for infrastructure development in the former Northern and Southern Rhodesia, later modified to university education and research in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]] and [[Malawi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beittrust.org.uk|title=HOME|website=www.beittrust.org.uk|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant infrastructure projects financed by the Trust include the [[Birchenough Bridge]] in the former Southern Rhodesia, named after Sir [[Henry Birchenough]], chairman of the Beit Trust from 1931 until 1937 and whose ashes are buried beneath the structure of the bridge.&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhodesianheritage.blogspot.com/2010/02/birchenough-bridge.html|title=Our Rhodesian Heritage: Birchenough Bridge|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Freeman (1880–1950)|Ralph Freeman]], the bridge's designer, was also the structural designer on the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and consequently the two bridges bear a close resemblance, although Birchenough is only two-thirds as long as the Australian bridge. It was built by Dorman Long and completed in 1935.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt; At a length of 1,080 feet (329 m) it was the third longest single-arch suspension bridge in the world at the time.

In recognition of his bequests the [[Royal School of Mines]], a faculty of [[Imperial College London]], erected a large memorial to Beit flanking the entrance to its building. The Imperial College residential halls on [[Prince Consort Road]] was named [[Beit Hall]] after him.

'''B Corporation''' certification (also known as '''B Lab''' certification or '''B Corp''' certification) is a private certification issued to [[For-profit corporation|for-profit companies]] by [[B Lab]], a global [[501(c) organization|nonprofit]] organization with offices in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a partnership in Latin America with Sistema B. To be granted and to preserve certification, companies must receive a minimum score on an online assessment for "[[Social impact assessment|social and environmental performance]]", satisfy the requirement that the company integrate [[B Lab]] commitments to [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]] into [[By-law|company governing documents]],  and pay an annual fee ranging from $500 to $50,000.&lt;ref name="Make It Official"&gt;{{cite web |title=B Corporation: Welcome  |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/become-a-b-corp/how-to-become-a-b-corp/make-it-official |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2018, there are over 2,600 certified B Corporations across 150 industries in 60 countries.&lt;ref name="B Corporation: Welcome"&gt;{{cite web |title=B Corporation: Welcome  |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/ |accessdate=August, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:Runa B Corp Label.jpg|thumb|Example of a B Corp certification label|193x193px]]
The B Lab certification is a third party standard requiring companies to meet [[social sustainability]] and environmental performance standards, meet accountability standards, and to be [[Sustainability reporting|transparent]] to the public according to the score they receive on the assessment. B Lab certification applies to the whole company across all product lines and issue areas. For-profits of all legal [[business entities|business structures]] are eligible for certification.

===Advantages===
* Similar to other [[Companies law|business associations]], certified B Corporations and their employees have access to a number of discounts from outside entities and fellow members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Save Money and Access Services |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/become-a-b-corp/why-become-a-b-corp/save-money-and-access-services |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Academic contributions of loan forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Loan Assistance Program — Overview  |publisher=Columbia Business School |url=http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/socialenterprise/careers/loanassistance |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Loan Assistance Program – Detailed Summary |publisher=New York University Stern School of Business |url=http://web-docs.stern.nyu.edu/admissions/financial-aid-loan-assistance-program-description-and-policies.pdf |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Loan Forgiveness Program |publisher=[[Yale School of Management]] |url=http://som.yale.edu/our-programs/full-time-mba/admissions/financing-your-mba/loan-forgiveness-program |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
* B Lab certification has no legal status.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Distinction from benefit corporation===
{{further|Benefit corporation}}
* Benefit corporation is a legal status conferred by state law in the US; B Lab certification is issued by a private organisation and has no legislative framework.&lt;ref name="What Are B Corps"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are B Corps |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/legislation |accessdate=16 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152828/https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/legislation |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* B Lab certification is not needed to obtain benefit corporation status.&lt;ref name="What Are B Corps"/&gt;
* Legislation for the passage of this corporate legal status has been passed in 30 states, including [[Delaware corporation|Delaware]], whereas B Lab certification is privately issued by an organisation run by people principally issued from the business community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Ariel |title=Delaware Just Made It A Whole Lot Easier For Socially Responsible Companies To Exist |publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company &amp; Inc.]] |date=July 23, 2013 |url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682654/delaware-just-made-it-a-whole-lot-easier-for-socially-responsible-companies-to-exist |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification process==

===Online assessment===
To obtain a B Corporation certification, a company first completes an online assessment. Companies that earn a minimum score of 80 out of 200 points undergo an assessment review process, essentially a conference call verifying the claims made in their assessment. Companies are required to provide supporting documentation before they are certified.

The assessment covers the company’s entire operation and measures the positive impact of the company in areas of [[Corporate governance|governance]], [[Employee engagement|workers]], [[Community service#Personal benefits of serving|community]], the [[Environmental impact|environment]], as well as the product or service the company provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Network for Business Innovation and Sustainability |title=B Corporations, Benefit Corporations and Social Purpose Corporations: Launching a New Era of Impact-Driven Companies |publisher=NBIS |date=October 2012 |url=http://nbis.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ImpactDrivenCompanies_NBIS_Whitepaper_Oct2012.pdf |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social business|Socially]] and environmentally-focused business model points ultimately are accrued in their relevant impact area (governance, workers, community or environment).&lt;ref name=giirs&gt;{{cite web |title=GIIRS Governance |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://giirs.org/about-giirs/how-giirs-works/185 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on a company's industry, geographic location, and number of employees, the online assessment adjusts the weightings of the question categories to increase its relevancy. For instance, companies with more employees will have a heavier weighting in the workers category, and companies in [[Manufacturing sector|manufacturing]] will have a heavier weighting in the environment category.

To maintain credibility, the B Corporation certification standard operates under principles that are independent, comprehensive, comparable, dynamic, and transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AB 361 Assembly Bill - BILL ANALYSIS |publisher=[[California State Assembly]] |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_0351-0400/ab_361_cfa_20110624_120507_sen_comm.html |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; B Lab has an established standards advisory council that can independently make decisions with or without the support of B Lab.&lt;ref name=giirs /&gt;  As of May 2014, 28 of 30 members were listed by their business affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Standards Advisory Council |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/the-non-profit-behind-b-corps/standards-advisory-council |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council recommends improvements to the B Corp assessment on a biennial basis. There is a 30-day public consultation period before releasing a new version of the B Corporation assessment.&lt;ref name="giirs"/&gt;

Currently the B Corp assessment is its fifth version, with the sixth version scheduled to be released in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corporate Social Responsibility Comes In Many Flavors, Some Not So Tasty |publisher=NonProfit Times Publishing Group |url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/corporate-social-responsibility-comes-in-many-flavors-some-not-so-tasty/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal requirements===
Certification also requires companies to integrate their stakeholder commitments into the company governing documents. In the United States, the avenue for corporations making the legal amendment to certify will depend on the state they are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in. Some states known as "constituency" states will allow for this change in the articles of incorporation, other states, known as "non-constituency states", will not; and many states now have the option of adopting the [[benefit corporation]] legal structure, which also meets B Lab's requirements for B Corp certification.&lt;ref name=howto&gt;{{cite web |title=Corporation Legal Roadmap |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=https://www.bcorporation.net/become-a-b-corp/how-to-become-a-b-corp/legal-roadmap/corporation-legal-roadmap |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the corporate model, other for-profit business entities make an amendment of the company by-laws or governing documents. These include:
* The establishment of clear wording to "consider stakeholder interests" in company [[Articles of Incorporation|articles of incorporation]] or [[By-law|company by-laws]].&lt;ref name=howto /&gt;
* Define "[[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]" as the employees, the community, the environment, suppliers, customers, and shareholders.&lt;ref name=howto /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Boatright (2006) and Johnstone and Lionais (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* No prioritization of one stakeholder over another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= OLR Backgrounder: Social Enterprise and the Benefit Corporation |publisher=State of Connecticut, Office of Legislative Research |url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/rpt/2013-R-0260.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allowing for the company's values to exist under new management, investors, or ownership.&lt;ref name=howto /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Lencioni (July 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, B Lab certification allows the company bylaws to remain secret.

==International adoption==
In September 2018, there were over 2,000 certified B Corporations across 130 industries in 50 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahsweeney/2018/09/13/how-b-corporations-change-the-way-entrepreneurs-think-about-profit-and-consumers/#405f3d5c3470|title=How B Corporations Change The Way Entrepreneurs Think About Profit And Consumers|last=Sweeney|first=Deborah|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Canada]] (78 companies), [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="B Corporation: Welcome"/&gt; The most active community outside of the United States is '''Sistema B'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The double bottom line: Profit and social benefit  |journal=Business Horizons |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681313001729 | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2013.10.001 |volume=57 |pages=11–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2012, Sistema B has been the adaptation of the B Corps movement in [[Latin America]], including in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Camacho |first=Manuel Antonio |title=In Just a Few Months, Sistema B (AKA: B Corp) Finds Fertile Ground for Social Enterprises in Latin America |url=http://www.nextbillion.net/blogpost.aspx?blogid=2908 |date=August 15, 2012 |publisher=NextBillion.net |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This non-profit adapts proprietary certifications and evaluation metrics and modifies both to the context of each country. B Lab also assists Sistema B in incorporating a [[benefit corporation]] distinction into local legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialenterprisebuzz.com/2012/09/26/b-lab-and-sistema-b-partner-to-take-b-corps-global/|title=B Lab and Sistema B Partner to take B Corps Global|last=Ip|first=Melissa|date=September 26, 2012|website=|publisher=Social Enterprise Buzz|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628141813/http://www.socialenterprisebuzz.com/2012/09/26/b-lab-and-sistema-b-partner-to-take-b-corps-global/|archive-date=28 June 2017|dead-url=|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beirut Stock Exchange''' (or '''BSE''') is the principal [[stock exchange]] of [[Lebanon]]. Located in [[Beirut]], it is a public institution run by a committee including a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman and eight members appointed via a decree issued by the Council of Ministers, in accordance with a proposal by the Minister of Finance. All BSE members are [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Joint stock companies]] (SAL) with a capital above 500,000 [[Lebanese Pound]]s and registered at the secretariat of the Commercial Register in. Members include [[holding company|holding companies]] and [[offshore companies]]. The BSE authorizes [[Brokerage firm]]s the operation and trade in securities listed on the BSE according to the [[:wikt:bourse|Bourse]] trading system and also lists the issuing companies (called "[[Listed companies]]") that have any of their stocks or other financial instruments listed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bse.com.lb/TheBSE/AboutBSE/tabid/62/Default.aspx http://www.bse.com.lb/TheBSE/AboutBSE/tabid/62/Default.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612003513/http://www.bse.com.lb/TheBSE/AboutBSE/tabid/62/Default.aspx |date=June 12, 2008 }}, The BSE - About BSE.

==History==
Beirut Stock Exchange, the second oldest market in the region, was established in 1920 by a decree of the [[French Mandate of Lebanon|French commissioner]]. Trading at that time was concentrated on gold and currency transactions, however in the 1930s there was an inflow of [[France|French]], [[Syrian]] and local Lebanese investment which made it possible for the BSE to flourish, especially with the establishment of mixed Lebanese-French joint stock companies that were quoted simultaneously on the [[Paris Bourse|Paris]] and Beirut Stock Exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metametrics.com/beirut.html http://www.metametrics.com/beirut.html], Development of the Beirut Stock Exchange. Retrieved on 2006-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The activity in the 1950s and 1960s increased with the enlisting of various banking, industrial and services companies along with an amount of 50 listed bonds.

During the [[Lebanese Civil War]] trading activity halted in 1983. After 11 years a new administrating committee (in collaboration with the ''Bourse de Paris'') re-launched the BSE with a new internal bylaw, re-structured and streamlined mechanisms and trading systems. A new automated brokers system was introduced, based on the fixing price instead of the traditional [[OTC Bulletin Board|OTC]] voice brokers. On November 22, 1996, the BSE officially re-launched the trading activity in its hall. The BSE and ''Bourse de Paris'' signed a cooperation agreement in June 1999 and the new [[Europe]]an NSC-[[UNIX]]–[[Euronext]] system was set. In 2000, new forms of securities were listed such as GDR ([[Global Depository Receipt]]), [[investment fund]]s shares, [[preferred stock]]s, priority shares and any other tradable derivatives. In late 2006, the BSE launched a new Remote Trading System, allowing the [[broker]]s to trade with the securities listed on the BSE "remotely" from their own offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bse.com.lb/TheBSE/History/tabid/63/Default.aspx http://www.bse.com.lb/TheBSE/History/tabid/63/Default.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817030818/http://www.bse.com.lb/TheBSE/History/tabid/63/Default.aspx |date=August 17, 2008 }}, The BSE - History.

'''Belyout Bouchentouf''' was a [[businessman]] and [[politician|statesman]] from the [[Kingdom of Morocco]]. Born in [[Casablanca]] at the turn of the 20th Century, he left a lasting legacy in the capital and the Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Political career ==

As [[Mayor]] of Casablanca for over 15 years (during the 1980s and 1990s) he had direct responsibility of the Kingdom's largest city. With a population of over 3 Million people, which represented well over 10% of the country's total population, he wielded considerable influence in the country. As mayor, he led many of the city's largest developments in [[infrastructure]], [[education]], [[Athletic sports|athletics]] and cultural life.

He was instrumental in raising Casablanca's international profile, and spearheaded the initiative to make Casablanca [[Sister city|Sister Cities]] with [[Chicago]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] ([[Brazil]]) and many others. See [[Casablanca#Twin towns|Casablanca Sister Cities]].

Belyout Bouchentouf was also a Member of Parliament in the Kingdom of Morocco.

== Bouchentouf Family ==

Belyout Bouchentouf was born in Casablanca. His father Mohammed Bouchentouf was also born in Casablanca and was one of the founding members of the city as we know it today. Place Bouchentouf (Derb Bouchentouf in Arabic), which was founded by Belyout Bouchentouf's father in the 1890s, is a major neighborhood in downtown Casablanca with a population of over 100,000 people today.

Belyout Bouchentouf has 6 children.

== Bouchentouf and the Royal Family of Morocco ==

In 1987, [[Princess Lalla Asma of Morocco|Her Highness Princess Lalla Asmaa]], daughter of [[Hassan II of Morocco|HRH King Hassan II]] and sister of the current [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|HRH King Mohammed VI]], married Belyout Bouchentouf's middle son. The marriage ceremony was attended by many dignitaries including [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|HRH King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] and other members of the Royal Families. As a member of the [[Royal Family of Morocco]], he worked very closely with King Hassan II in instituting political and social reforms to improve the quality of life of citizens.

As the brother-in-law of King Hassan II, Belyout Bouchentouf was a close and trusted advisor on many key aspects of life in the Kingdom as well as affairs in the broader [[Middle East]].

'''Butler Ames''' (August 22, 1871 – November 6, 1954) was an American politician, engineer, soldier and businessman. He was the son of [[Adelbert Ames]] and grandson of [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]], both decorated generals in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

Born in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], Ames attended the public schools and [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]], and graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1894. He resigned from the [[United States Army]] after appointment as second lieutenant to the Eleventh Regiment, United States Infantry; took a postgraduate course at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], was a member of [[Theta Xi]] fraternity, and graduated in 1896 as a mechanical and electrical engineer.

Ames engaged in manufacturing; served as a member of the common council of Lowell in 1896; like his father, he re-joined the Army during the [[Spanish–American War]] and was commissioned lieutenant and adjutant of the Sixth Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry; appointed acting engineer officer of the Second Army Corps under [[William Montrose Graham, Jr.|General Graham]], in addition to his duties as adjutant. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1898; served as civil administrator of the Arecibo district of [[Puerto Rico]] until November 1898.

[[File:Brazilian Aeronautical Commission.JPG|thumb|left|Ames' former residence in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

Ames became a member of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] 1897–1899; elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[58th United States Congress|Fifty-eighth]] and to the four succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1903 – March 3, 1913); was not a candidate for renomination in 1912; resumed manufacturing pursuits; president of [[United States Cartridge Company]], and treasurer of Heinze Electrical Co. of Lowell; at time of death was treasurer and a director of Wamesit Power Co. of Lowell, Massachusetts; director of Union Land and Grazing Co., Colorado Springs, Colorado, and vice president and a director of Ames Textile in Lowell.

Ames was completely taken with [[Villa del Balbianello]] when he visited Europe for the first time in 1912, and he determined to purchase the Villa.  He succeeded in 1919, beautifully restoring the Villa.  On a Dictaphone Tape he tells the story (also a short autobiography).  The Tape was transcribed, and his greater family published it in book form: "Butler Ames and the Villa Balbianello, Lake Como, Italy, An American Oral History."  Essays and introductions by Evelyn Ames, Pauline Ames Plimpton, Ezio Antonini, Sarah and George Plimpton plus period photographs and the illustrated Guest Book 1920 to 1970 was added. The book was edited by Oakes Plimpton and printed by Hobblebush Press, 2009, available through Amazon Books or Oakes Plimpton, 67 Coolidge Road, Arlington, MA 02476.

Ames died in [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts]] in 1954, at the age of 83. He is buried, along with his father, grandfather and extended family, in the Hildreth family cemetery, behind the main cemetery on Hildreth Street in Lowell.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7500803 Butler Ames (1871–1954) - Find A Grave Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt; His heirs sold Villa del Balbianello in 1974 to [[Guido Monzino]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friendsoffai.org/where-we-are_villa-del-balbianello.php "Villa del Balbianello" ''Friends of FAI''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610122217/http://www.friendsoffai.org/where-we-are_villa-del-balbianello.php |date=2016-06-10 }} retrieved May 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2147">'''Consumer relationship systems''' ('''CRS''') are specialized [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) [[software]] applications that are used to handle a company's dealings with its customers.&lt;ref name ="Insight44-50"&gt;[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/cmp/cmi_200709/index.php ICMI Customer Management Insight Magazine, September 2007, pp 44–50], Retrieved 11 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Current consumer relationship systems integrate the [[software]] with telephone and call recording systems as well as with corporate systems for input and reporting. Customers can provide input from the company's website directly into the CRS. These systems are popular because they can deliver the 'voice of the consumer' that contributes to product quality improvement and that ultimately increases corporate profits.&lt;ref name ="Insight44-50" /&gt;

Consumer relationship systems that provide automated support as well as advanced systems may have [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) interfaces that can extract and analyse [[data]] collected, or handle basic questions and complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith| first1=S.E.|title= What is Consumer Relationship System? |date= |publisher= WiseGeek.net|url= http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-consumer-relationship-system.htm|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first CRS was developed in the 1980s. In 1981 Michael Wilke and Robert Thornton founded Wilke/Thornton, Inc in [[Columbus, Ohio]], to develop new CRS software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilke-thornton.com/WTI/Pages/products.html Wilke/Thornton, Inc Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820093347/http://www.wilke-thornton.com/WTI/Pages/products.html |date=2008-08-20 }} Retrieved 11 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegheny County drink tax controversy===
In late 2007 [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] received permission from the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] to pursue increased taxation of poured alcohol and rental cars to subsidize the [[Port Authority of Allegheny County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08061/861750-85.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Drink tax passes first test - compliance | first=Karamagi | last=Rujumba | date=March 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Allegheny County Council and Onorato believed that such a tax was preferable to increasing county property taxes. After the 10% tax on poured alcohol passed, Allegheny County bar and restaurant owners protested the new tax, claiming that it would hurt that business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07191/800603-46.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Restaurant owners vow to fight drink tax | first=Steve | last=Twedt | date=July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit by the bar and restaurant owners challenging the legality of the drink tax was thrown out by the courts, but they sought a referendum overturning the tax in the November 2008 general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08052/859217-46.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Drink tax challenge could go on ballot | first=Karamagi | last=Rujumba | date=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Onorato subsequently withheld the funds raised by the drink tax from the Port Authority, demanding that the transit agency first restructure its labor costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atu.org/atwork/transit_news/county-exec-witholds-funds-demands-atu-concessions.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20081026202851/http://www.atu.org/atwork/transit_news/county-exec-witholds-funds-demands-atu-concessions.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 October 2008|title=County exec witholds &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; funds, demands ATU concessions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=Atu.org|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 Presidential election===
He announced his endorsement of [[Hillary Clinton|Senator Hillary Clinton]] in her [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential bid]] on March 14, 2008, saying, "Hillary Clinton has the experience and the determination to clean up the mess in Washington and deliver results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = HillaryClinton.com - Media Release| year = 2008| url =http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=6526| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080402225902/http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=6526| archivedate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also received media attention when the G-20 Summit was held in Pittsburgh. He defeated State Senator [[Anthony H. Williams|Anthony Williams]], [[Auditor General of Pennsylvania|Auditor General]] [[Jack Wagner (politician)|Jack Wagner]], and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania#Government|Montgomery County Commissioner]] [[Joe Hoeffel]].

[[File:Workers At Dusk, GEC, Chittagong.jpg|thumb|Construction labors in [[Chittagong]], [[Bangladesh]].]]
'''Day labor''' (or '''day labour''' in [[American and British English spelling differences|Commonwealth spelling]]) is work done where the worker is hired and paid one day at a time, with no promise that more work will be available in the future. It is a form of [[contingent work]].

==Types==
[[File:Mednyánszky, László - Day Labourer.jpg|thumb|upright|''Day Labourer'' (painting by [[László Mednyánszky]])]]
[[File:Tagelöhnerhaus qtl1.jpg|thumb|left|House of a day labourer in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Open-air museum Beuren|de|3=Freilichtmuseum Beuren}}, Germany]]
Day [[laborer]]s find work through three common routes.

Firstly, some [[employment agency|employment agencies]] specialize in very short-term contracts for manual labor most often in construction, factories, offices, and manufacturing. These companies usually have offices where workers can arrive and be assigned to a job on the spot, as they are available.

Secondly, a manager looking for additional labor to fill an unexpected change in plans is presented with a problem of finding the needed quantity of labor with the right skills. Imagine the magnitude of the task of looking for workers, on the side of the street or by calling various employment agencies, who can verify that they are journeyman asphalt rakers, typists, programmers, etc. The benefit of representation is applied to both the labor and employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freeman |first1=R. |last2= Medoff |first2=J. |title=What Do Unions Do? |location=New York |work=Basic Books, Inc. |year=1984 |url=http://www.uschinalabor.org/docs%5CWhat%20Do%20Unions%20Do_E.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ecsocman.edu.ru/db/msg/22917.html&lt;/ref&gt; Labor is given a source of recourse to achieve a safe work environment free of favoritism and arbitrary work assignments. Employers benefit from organized labor training programs, benefit plans, dispute resolution&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laborerslocal185.com/disputes_resolutions.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917131935/http://www.laborerslocal185.com/disputes_resolutions.htm |date=September 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a labor supply meeting most employers labor demand at most any time or place. The benefit of a labor supply arriving at a specified time and location within less than a day's notice is reduced overhead resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ehrenburg |first1=R. |last2=Smith |first2=R. |title=Modern Labor Economics: Theory and Public Policy, 8th Edition |work== Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations |year=2003 |page=132 |ISBN=0-321-30503-5 |url=http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~liuyc/LaborPaper/ch4sup.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ecsocman.edu.ru/db/msg/5524.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly and less formally, workers meet at well-known locations, usually public street corners or commercial parking lots, and wait for [[building contractor]]s, landscapers, home owners and small business owners, and other potential employers to offer work. Much of this work is in small residential [[construction]] or landscaping.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/10/national/10depot.html |title=Day Laborer Battle Runs Outside Home Depot |publisher= New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workers earn, on average, $8–$10 an hour. The media and a study by [[UCLA]] portrays day laborers as being illegal immigrants from [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.uclalumni.net/eNewsletters/Connect/Feb06/DayLabor.cfm?email=G2II ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023171616/http://www.uclalumni.net/eNewsletters/Connect/Feb06/DayLabor.cfm?email=G2II |date=October 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who otherwise can't get work due to current employment regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/Title_08.txt&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found that day laborers are not typically illegal immigrants, many even being citizens of the US, and that day labor is often a transition to full-time work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daylaborinfo.org/research.aspx |title=Research |publisher=Daylaborinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Day labor in the United States==
day labor (or labour in commonwealth spelling ) is work done where the worker is hired and paid one day at time , with no promise that more work will be available in the future. it is a form of contingent work.
Informal day labor is not new to the United States, and day laborers are not always [[migrant workers]] in many cases. In his study of day laborers in [[Atlanta]], Terry Easton interviews [[white people|white]] and [[black people|black]] day laborers in addition to [[Hispanic]] workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southernspaces.org/2007/geographies-hope-and-despair-atlantas-african-american-latino-and-white-day-laborers |title=Terry Easton, Geographies of Hope and Despair: Atlanta's African American, Latino, and White Day Laborers |publisher=Southernspaces.org |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other metropolitan areas still have non-immigrant day laborers, and many other large and small cities have immigrant day laborers from a variety of countries, including [[Mongolia]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Brazil]], Central and South America, and countries in [[Africa]]. Non-immigrant informal day labor, seen in many cities, does not generate the controversy or calls to police and local government seen when immigrant day laborers gather to wait for work.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Unorganized day labor creates real problems for day laborers: 1 in 3 corner day laborers have experienced theft of wages in the past two months; 1 in 5 experienced a serious worksite injury in the past year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Low wages and poor working conditions, employer abuse, and lack of insurance for work related accidents is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.issuelab.com/browse/browse_pub.php?pub_id=478 |title=Speak for Yourself: What Girls Say about What Girls Need |publisher=IssueLab |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ordonez Juan Thomas (2015) Jornalero: Being a Day Laborer in the USA. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous complaints are made about immigrant day laborers. These include loitering, noise, crime and rushing cars of potential employers in parking lots. Cities and counties have tried a variety of solutions with varied success. Some municipalities and communities have supported workers' efforts to organize themselves into democratically run [[day labor centers|workers' centers]], designated areas, and [[organization]]s to defend [[labor rights|workers' rights]] in general. Workers' Centers of this kind date back at least 18 years{{when|date=March 2014}} to [[Los Angeles]].  Other municipalities have targeted day labor sites for aggressive enforcement of immigration laws.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/1017arpaioimmigration1017.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though united in their commitment to the rights of [[migrant worker|immigrant workers]], NDLON and the Day Labor Research Institute represent two very different models of day labor center. NDLON represents the "social service agency model" and the Institute the "day laborer designed model."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;http://daylaborinfo.org/Documents/Comparing%20Day%20Labor%20Center%20Models.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These different models of day labor centers may yield markedly different results that reflect the different goals of each model.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Problems when workers' centers are established are also common: day laborers often continue to congregate in large numbers on the streets surrounding the day labor centers, refusing to leave the street and use the center;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Svensson |first=Lynn |title=Best Practices for Day Labor Centers" Planning |publisher=American Planning Association |date=April 2006:10 |url=http://myapa.planning.org/planning/member/2006apr/daylaborside.htm?project=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; new problems can be created, including new crowds of homeless and substance abusers loitering near the center after hours, and large numbers of day laborers drawn from other areas to the streets surrounding the centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daylaborinfo.org/Documents/disorder_at_daylaborsites.pdf |format=PDF |title=Disorder at Day Laborer Sites |publisher=Daylaborinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low levels of work at the centers, low wages, and problems with the job distribution system are also common.&lt;ref&gt;http://daylaborinfo.org/Documents/FinalOneStopReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6147">'''Desktop outsourcing''' is the process in which an [[organization]] contracts a third party to maintain and manage parts of its [[IT infrastructure]]. Contracts vary in depth and can range from [[Computer maintenance|Computer hard]]- and [[software maintenance]] to [[Desktop virtualisation]], [[SaaS]]-implementations and [[Helpdesk]] operation.  It is estimated, that 32% of U.S. and Canadian IT organisations make use of desktop outsourcing in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bekker|first1=Scott|title=Should You Outsource Your Help Desk?|url=http://redmondmag.com/Articles/2014/09/01/Should-You-Outsource.aspx?Page=3|website=Redmond Magazine|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent market reports suggest the adoption of [[BYOD]] policies to allow the end-user a free choice of devices in their working environment may increase this market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Desktop Outsourcing Market 2012-2016|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/xbv6lv/global_desktop|website=Research and Markets|publisher=TechNavio|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desktop-Outsourcing im Trend|url=http://www.itadministrator.de/themen/virtualisierung/111035.html|website=ITAdministrator.de|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viability==
Justification for desktop outsourcing could include shifting focus and energy to areas of core competency, reducing staffing costs, and the routine maintenance, upgrades, and repairs associated with managing multitudes of PC systems and servers. (Applegate et al. 2007). Managers may also seek desktop outsourcing as a method of simplifying organisational structures to cut costs associated with them.&lt;ref name="dfcw"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedlander|first1=David|title=Why outsource desktop management?|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Why-outsource-desktop-management|website=ComputerWeekly.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For smaller companies it might also be more viable financially to outsource their desktop at a set price per machine, rather than creating an entire internal IT department.&lt;ref name="littman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Littman|first1=Dan|title=Outsourcing the desktop|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2655241/techology-business/outsourcing-the-desktop.html|website=InfoWorld.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent market growth can also be attributed to the decreasing price of hardware, making replacement more favourable than repairs.&lt;ref name="dfcw" /&gt; Possible risks when desktop outsourcing are ensuring continued support for old a unique systems the company depends on, specifically if any of the systems in question were internally developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=Stephen|title=Managing Risk in Outsourcing: The Strategy|url=http://www.sourcingmag.com/managing-risk-in-outsourcing-the-strategy/|website=SourcingMag.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may cause the contractor to be unable to fulfil their contractual obligations, as in the case of the US Navy outsourcing their IT systems to EDS in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Ephraim|title=Painful lessons from IT outsourcing gone bad|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2652801/outsourcing/painful-lessons-from-it-outsourcing-gone-bad.html|website=InfoWorld.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market situation==
A 2012 TechNavio market report forecasts that the desktop outsourcing market will grow by 4.65% yearly, between 2012 and 2016. [[Atos]], [[Computer Sciences Corporation|CSC]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[IBM]] are considered the leading desktop outsourcing vendors for that time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research and Markets: Global Desktop Outsourcing Market 2012-2016 Research Report|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/research-markets-global-desktop-outsourcing-104100265.html|website=Yahoo Finance|publisher=BusinessWire|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Gartner]] report from 2013, however, considers the desktop outsourcing market to be in decline, with growth only occurring on the Latin American and Asia/Pacific markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartner Says Worldwide IT Outsourcing Market to Reach $288 Billion in 2013|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2550615|website=gartner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* While consolidating School Districts in 2003, New York city brought in Dell to assess and consolidate their IT systems. At the time it was unclear how many devices actually existed in the network. Being largely successful, this netted Dell a $20 million yearly contract to keep on managing the School Districts systems.&lt;ref name="littman" /&gt;
* NASA's Kennedy Space Center had its IT services, approximately 22,000 devices, outsourced in 1998 for $30 million a year on a 3-year contract.&lt;ref name="gaogov"&gt;{{cite web|title=DESKTOP OUTSOURCING: Positive Results Reported, but Analyses Could Be Strengthened|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/240/234095.pdf|website=gao.gov|publisher=United States General Accounting Office|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown Detroit''' is the [[central business district]] and a [[Neighborhoods in Detroit|residential]] area of the city of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], United States. Detroit is the major city in the larger [[Metro Detroit]] region. Downtown Detroit is bordered by [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]] (Lodge Freeway) to the west, [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]] (I-75, Fisher Freeway) to the north, [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|I-375]] (Chrysler Freeway) to the east, and the [[Detroit River]] to the south. The city's main thoroughfare [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|M-1]] (Woodward Avenue) links Downtown to [[Midtown Detroit|Midtown]], [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]], and the [[North End, Detroit|North End]].

Downtown contains much [[Architecture of metropolitan Detroit|historic architecture]] and many of the prominent skyscrapers in Detroit, including the [[Renaissance Center]], the [[Penobscot Building]], [[One Detroit Center]], and the [[Guardian Building]]. Historic churches, [[Theatre in Detroit|theatres]], and commercial buildings anchor the various downtown districts. Downtown has a number of parks including those linked by a promenade along the [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]]. Its central square is [[Campus Martius Park]].

==Overview==
[[File:RenCen.JPG|thumb|150px|left|The [[Renaissance Center]] along the [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]]]]
In recent years the downtown area has seen tremendous growth and redevelopment. Since 2000 a number of major construction projects have been completed including the new [[Compuware World Headquarters|Compuware Headquarters]] at [[Campus Martius Park]] and two new stadiums: [[Comerica Park]] and [[Ford Field]]. [[General Motors]] moved their headquarters into the [[Renaissance Center]], and the [[Detroit Lions]] have relocated from [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] to Downtown Detroit. High-profile events like the 2005 [[MLB All-Star Game]], [[Super Bowl XL]], and the [[2006 World Series|2006]] and [[2012 World Series]] have taken place in downtown, generating income for local businesses and spurring more growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061106/NEWS05/611060337/-1/BUSINESS07 Detroit Free Press (2006-11-06)]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, new residents are moving into Detroit in the assortment of new lofts that are opening. An example of these trends is the [[Westin Book-Cadillac Hotel]].

What demographics are to people, firmographics are to organizations. However, Webster (2005) suggested that the term "firmographics" is a combination of demographics and [[geographics]].

Commonly used firmographics include [[Standard Industrial Classification|SIC]], company size and location. The term "firmographics" is mostly used in relation to a first step of nested approach or [[Market segment|segment]]ation funnel, which was introduced by Shapiro and Bonoma in 1984.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/business-to-business-marketing/oclc/656776045?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|title=Business-to-business marketing|last=Brennan|first=Ross|last2=Canning|first2=Louise|last3=McDowell|first3=Raymond|date=2010|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781849201551|location=London|pages=386|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and purposes==

Firmographics variables allow firms to consider the features of [[organizational behavior]] in detail, for instance in a particular [[industry]]. It is helpful when there is no significant difference between operating variables, [[purchasing]] approach, situational factors and personal characteristics of customers.

Geodemographic segmentation is a logical starting point because  
#The data are obtainable through secondary sources, government agencies, or demographic [[vendor]]s; 
#It provides a quick snapshot of a market—an understanding of [[market structure]] and potential customer segments; and  
#Target populations can be sampled to represent characteristics of the entire market at a much lower cost than other forms of business segmentation.&lt;ref name="Art Weinstein. Handbook of market segmentation"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQXfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT79&amp;lpg=PT79&amp;dq=chapter+4+geographics+firmographics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zK7ZnZHtqR&amp;sig=d3Pqk1MOWaAACu-ZBbHSgy20IZM&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lLCuUq7RCZHV4QTR-ICYCg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%204%20geographics%20firmographics&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Market Segmentation: Strategic Targeting for Business and Technology Firms, Third Edition|last=Weinstein|first=Art|date=2013-10-31|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135185664|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Webster (2005) believed that this approach misses a set of essential variables. Moreover, a differentiation between segmentation bases of nested approach is too complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Уэбстер, Фредерик.

==Historical development==

The first attempts to segment industrial markets were made in 1934. J. Frederick described five factors that should be considered when defining a component market: industry, product use, company buying habits, channels of distribution, and geographic location.&lt;ref name="Balancing Theory and Practice: A Reappraisal of Business-to-Business Segmentation"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850198000029 | doi=10.1016/S0019-8501(98)00002-9 | volume=27 | title=Balancing Theory and Practice | journal=Industrial Marketing Management | pages=429–445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term emporographics was coined by Banting in the early 1970s and refers to the equivalent of demographics in the context of industrial markets (Gross, A.C., Banting, P.M., Meredith, L.N., and Ford, I.D.: Business Marketing. Houghton Mifflin, Boston, MA, 1993).&lt;ref name="Balancing Theory and Practice: A Reappraisal of Business-to-Business Segmentation" /&gt; However, now the term “firmographics” is increasingly widely used.

[[Jerry Wind|Yoram Wind]] and Richard Cardozo  in 1974 advocate a two-stage approach to industrial segmentation that consists of macrosegments and microsegments. They explain that macrosegments consist of key organizational characteristics such as size of the buying firm, SIC category, geographic location, and usage factors, hence, mostly of firm demographics. In some cases, single-stage segmentation based primarily on business demographics is sufficient for identifying and targeting markets. More typical, however, is that a two-stage approach that will employ benefits and organizational [[psychographics]] and purchasing criteria will be needed to provide complete market profiles.&lt;ref name="Art Weinstein. Handbook of market segmentation" /&gt;

Firmographics play crucial role in one of the most significant developments in business segmentation theory came in 1984 with the work of Bonoma and Shapiro who were the first to propose a truly multistep basis for segmenting business markets. They proposed the use of five general segmentation criteria which they arranged in a nested hierarchy. The set of segmentation bases captures from macro-level to micro-level, and firmographics belong to the macro approach and comprise from industry, company size, customer location.&lt;ref name="Art Weinstein. Handbook of market segmentation" /&gt;

==Benefits and pitfalls==

It is not recommended to base segmentation solely on emporographics in the long term unless they reflect clear differences in needs, benefits, and product use. This is because the increasing competitive pressures observable in most organizational markets will, sooner or later, erode any industry structures not based on customer needs.&lt;ref name="Balancing Theory and Practice: A Reappraisal of Business-to-Business Segmentation" /&gt;

Firmographics may bear little direct relation to user needs or purchase requirements and benefits. Curran and Goodfellow suggest that descriptor-based approaches are popular, because they are convenient, clear cut, easy to implement, and they result in boundaries that are relatively stable over time.

Nevertheless, they add, such approaches are also arbitrary and usually are based largely on managerial judgment and intuition. It is easy for empirically oriented academics to underestimate the importance and value of managerial intuition, especially when this is based on experience. The attraction of descriptor-based or firmographic approaches is understandable in the circumstances and can provide useful and important insights to the practical issues of engaging with customers. More accurately, such emporographic variables facilitate such logistical issues of supplier convenience as minimizing sales or distribution costs and, perhaps, prices but this is not the principal reason for emporographic analysis.

But these approaches provide little understanding of underlying customer needs and so do not constitute a sufficient basis for segmentation in unfamiliar or competitively challenging markets. This point is demonstrated in product development processes where sophisticated segmentation will provide ample insight to evolving customer needs into the future, while emporographic approaches will struggle even to describe historic customer needs.&lt;ref name="Balancing Theory and Practice: A Reappraisal of Business-to-Business Segmentation" /&gt;

==Variables==

===Industry===

Industry firmographics refer to the activities of the [[firm]]. At a very high level, organizations can be classified into business and government segments. Most business activities are naturally constrained to certain industries due to their core competencies or the demands of the customers. Only a few business activities are not. Therefore, industry type becomes a natural market segmentation variable for businesses. Government organizations can be segmented by their federal, state, county, regional, city, and municipality status.&lt;ref name="The Most Important Word Missing From Your Go-To-Market Strategy"&gt;http://www.wiglafjournal.com/marketing/2013/01/what-are-firmographics&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant business segmentation variables are those associated with an [[NAICS]] or [[Standard Industrial Classification|SIC]] code. NAICS refers to the North American Industry Classification System adapted by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census bureau]] in 1997. SIC refers to the older Standard Industrial Classification system that was established in 1937. Either NAICS or SIC can be used to identify firms by industry.  While most businesses use the newer NAICS, many still work with the older SIC and both systems can be used with most modern business research reports and tools.

===Location===
Location firmographics refers to where the business is located. As a segmentation variable, firms may be aggregated by city, metropolitan statistical area, state, region, country, or continent.  Alternatively, firms may be targeted according to their distance from a central location, usually the location of the firm conducting the sales and marketing effort. Most business activities are naturally constrained to certain regions due to competitive pressures, legal restrictions, and cost constraints. Only a few business activities are not.  As such, location becomes a natural market segmentation variable for businesses. The nature of the industry plays a role if the location is of big importance. Businesses in a certain industry can therefore be compared with each other on location.&lt;ref name="The Most Important Word Missing From Your Go-To-Market Strategy" /&gt;

===Customer size===

Customer size in Firmographics refers to the size of clients the company has. This can range from small- to mid-size companies or Fortune 500 clients. (Korten, 2012) The size of customers companies aim for may distinguish one company from another. The basis for measuring the different size of customers is depending on which product or service is being purchased. For example, you have customers that purchase high volume because of low-priced product or customers that purchase low volume because of high-priced product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Status and structure===

Status and structure firmographics can refer to the relation of one organization to another, or it can refer to the legal status of an organization. For instance, individual establishments (also known as firms by the above definition) may be categorized as being independent businesses, part of a larger parent company, or the headquarters of a parent company.  Similarly, firms may be categorized as being a stand-alone entity, a franchisee of a franchising organization, a subsidiary of a larger organization, or the outlet of a larger organization. Alternatively, firms may be categorized as being a sole proprietorship, limited liability corporation, limited liability partnership, private corporation, or public shareholder-owned corporation. Other variables describing the status or structure of an organization are used as well.

===Performance===

Performance firmographics refer to the characteristics of a firm related to its business execution over time. The duration of a firm’s existence, rate of growth or decline, profits and losses, and changes in profits and losses can all be indicators of the likelihood of a firm to need a business product or service.  Firms in the same industry of relatively similar size but undergoing different rates of growth or decline are likely to have very different demands for business services.  As such, they can form meaningful segmentation variables.&lt;ref name="The Most Important Word Missing From Your Go-To-Market Strategy" /&gt; Companies carrying put segmentation of their customers choose performance metrics based on the information they would like to acquire. That is why there may be no performance variable, but a group of variables that can be referred to as «performance», such as:
#Annual revenue: There’s usually a clear correlation between how significant a company’s annual earnings are, and whether a buyer would have money in the budget to afford doing business with a company.
#Executive title: Which titles are proven most likely to need your products and/or services?
#Average sales cycle: How long does the average sale take to close? What is the official dividing line between prospects who want to make a well-informed buying decision and those who have no real intention of buying.

The '''globally integrated enterprise''' is a term coined in 2006 by [[Sam Palmisano]], the then CEO of [[IBM]] Corp, used to denote "a company that fashions its strategy, its management, and its operations in pursuit of a new goal: the integration of [[Manufacturing|production]] and [[Value chain|value delivery]] worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ibm.com/ibm/governmentalprograms/samforeignaffairs.pdf | title = The Globally Integrated Enterprise | first = Sam | last = Palmisano | date = 15 March 2006 | accessdate = 10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Argument==
Palmisano argues that in the [[international]] model of the 20th century, most operations were centred in their home country, with only elements of sales and distribution happening overseas.
The multinational model of the 21st century&amp;mdash;in which companies created small versions of themselves in each country&amp;mdash;was a response to the [[trade barriers]] that arose after the [[World Wars]].  For IBM&amp;mdash;Palmisano's employer&amp;mdash;this was a successful model because it enabled the company to grow in those markets, understand local customer requirements and cultivate local talent.  But it also created [[wikt:redundancy|redundancy]] or [[wikt:duplication|duplication]] as each country had its own [[Back office|back-office]] functions, such as&amp;mdash; [[Supply chain|supply]], [[procurement]], [[finance]] and [[human resources]].

Now the globally integrated enterprise can locate functions anywhere in the world, based on the right cost, skills and environment, argues Palmisano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Colin|title=IBM boss spells out a better future|url=http://news.cnet.com/IBM-boss-spells-out-a-better-future/2100-1014_3-6082779.html|accessdate=26 September 2012|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, IBM now has one supply chain; and this new [[Organizational structure|organizational]] [[Macrostructure (sociology)|macrostructure]] has [[emergence|emerged]] because [[Complex adaptive system#General properties|everything is connected]], and work can move to the place where it is performed cheapest. This approach is made possible due to the rise of [[globalization]], and coming down of many of the barriers that haltered [[cross-border]] [[commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Globalisation's offspring|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8960441?story_id=8960441|accessdate=26 September 2012|newspaper=Economist|date=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmisano mentions the ''Law of Global Integration'', driven by three forces&amp;mdash;economics, expertise and openness&amp;mdash;without explicitly stating what it is or how it can be verified.

==Criticisms==
[[Brad Setser]] of [[RGE Monitor|Roubini Global Economics (RGE) Monitor]] wrote:
:'In my view, this underscores a key element of tension in America’s current backlash against globalization that was not evident in the late 1980s. Today, the pressures are being borne disproportionately by labor, whereas 20 years ago, capital and labor were in the struggle together. In the late 1980s, many of the once proud icons of Corporate America were fighting for competitive survival at the same time that US workers were feeling the heat of global competition. The pain was, in effect, balanced. Today, US companies, as seen through the lens of corporate profitability, are thriving as never before while the American [[workforce]] is increasingly isolated in its competitive squeeze. In essence, [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Labour (economics)|labor]] are working very much at cross purposes in the current climate, whereas back in the late 1980s they were both in the same boat.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.relooney.info/0_New_2372.pdf |title= Global Protectionist Threats: Then and Now |date= 26 January 2007 |accessdate= 10 June 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HECO power plant at Kahe Point in West [[Oahu]]]]

'''Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc.''' ('''HEI'''; {{nyse|HE}}) is the largest supplier of electricity in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Hawaii]], supplying power to 95% of Hawaii's population through its electric utilities: Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc., Hawai'i Electric Light Company, Inc. and Maui Electric Company, Limited. In addition, HEI owns a financial institution serving Hawaii, [[American Savings Bank]].&lt;ref name="heco.com"&gt;[http://www.heco.com/portal/site/heco/menuitem.20516707928314340b4c0610c510b1ca/?vgnextoid=575df2b154da9010VgnVCM10000053011bacRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=defau HECO &gt; About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

HECO, HELCO, and MECO employ more than 2,000 people. Approximately 20,000 Hawaii residents are shareholders of HECO’s parent company, Hawaiian Electric Industries.&lt;ref name="power facts"&gt;[http://www.heco.com/vcmcontent/StaticFiles/pdf/PowerFacts_6-2010.pdf HECO Power Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; The company is headquartered in [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|Honolulu]]. The net income of the company reached 164 million dollars by the end of 2012 with a yearly revenue of 3.4 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3AHE&amp;fstype=ii&amp;ei=J-8xU8CCFIi5sQeyTQ Finance]&lt;/ref&gt;

The island of [[Kauai]] is the only island in the state not supplied by HEI. Instead, the consumer-owned [[Kauai Island Utility Cooperative]] manages that island's electricity.

==History==
Hawaiian Electric Company (often abbreviated HECO, pronounced HEE-coh) incorporated on October 13, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heco.com/portal/site/heco/menuitem.508576f78baa14340b4c0610c510b1ca/?vgnextoid=08685e658e0fc010VgnVCM1000008119fea9RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=575df2b154da9010VgnVCM10000053011bacRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=defau&amp;vgnextrefresh=1&amp;level=0&amp;ct=article Birth Of HECO]&lt;/ref&gt; Within about 16 years the utility had 2,500 customers on the island of [[Oahu]]. By 1914 HECO had started rural service to the windward side of the island and was marketing electric products like refrigerators and flat irons. By 1937 HECO broke ground on its second power plant, and transmission lines soon crisscrossed Oahu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heco.com/portal/site/heco/menuitem.508576f78baa14340b4c0610c510b1ca/?vgnextoid=ba685e658e0fc010VgnVCM1000008119fea9RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=575df2b154da9010VgnVCM10000053011bacRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=defau&amp;vgnextrefresh=1&amp;level=0&amp;ct=article Electrifying Oahu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===War and statehood===
During [[World War II]] HECO power plants, now linked to busy military bases, generated more than one million kilowatt hours of electricity each day. (= &gt; 42 MW average power)

Hawaii became a state in 1959, and by then the entire island of Oahu was electrified. Massive power plants, some still in operation today, came online. HECO flipped the switch on a 116 MW plant in downtown Honolulu in 1954. The state's first reheat steam turbine generator went on line at Kahe on the west coast of Oahu. Today, Kahe is the state's largest plant with a total generating capacity of 650 MW.

===Island expansion===
HECO purchased Maui Electric Company (abbreviated MECO and pronounced ME-coh) in 1968. In 1970 HECO also acquired the Big Island's Hilo Electric Light Company (later to be renamed Hawaii Electric Light Company, abbreviated HELCO and pronounced HEL-coh). MECO had expansion plans of its own. In 1988, it acquired the Lanai City power plant on the island of Lanai, and in 1989, Molokai Electric Company on the island of Molokai. Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) was created as a holding company for these various utilities in 1983.&lt;ref name="heco.com"/&gt;
In 2013 HECO began working with [[Siemens]] to develop a self-healing grid in eastern Oahu and Waikiki that will ensure a reliable electrical supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w3.siemens.com/topics/global/en/references/sgp_oahu/pages/main.aspx|title=Smart Grid Project Improves Grid Reliability for Oahu, Hawaii - References - Siemens|website=w3.siemens.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2014, [[NextEra Energy]] tendered an offer to purchase HEI for $4.3 billion. The sale required approval by the Hawaii Public Utility Commission.&lt;ref name=hei&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chediak |first1=Mark |last2=Goossens |first2=Ehren |title=NextEra Buys Hawaii's Biggest Utility in Green Energy Test |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-04/nextera-buys-hawaii-s-biggest-utility-in-green-energy-test-case.html |agency=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=4 December 2014 |accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, 2016, it was announced that the merger was cancelled after the State PUC disapproved the deal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/nextera-hawaiian-electric-terminate-merger-bid-1468838067&lt;/ref&gt; The merger included plans to convert HEI's [[fuel oil|oil]]-fired generating plants to run on [[natural gas]], which were to use [[liquified natural gas]] imported from a [[British Columbia]] plant of [[FortisBC]]. The upgrades were cancelled as they were dependent upon approval of the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aging Hawaii Plant Upgrades Halted After Failed Merger|work=Engineering New Record|issue=Volume 277/Number 4|publisher=BNP Media|date=July 15, 2016|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generation==
In 2016 HECO produced 8.8 TWh, of which 2.3 TWh were renewable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.hawaiianelectric.com/clean-energy-hawaii/clean-energy-facts |title=Clean Energy Facts|publisher=HECO |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the power came from oil, using 8.5 million barrels in 2016, down from 10.7 million barrels in 2008.&lt;ref name=gtm2017-04&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/hawaiis-clean-energy-and-oil-consumption-report-card |title=Hawaii’s Clean Energy and Oil Consumption Report Card|publisher=| date=24 April 2017 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaiian Electric supports the adoption of electric vehicles. The company's goal is to have the majority of vehicles in Hawaii be electric vehicles by 2045. As of November 2018, it currently stands at 1% of all vehicles on the road. Hawaiian Electric filed a road map with the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/fs/Hawaii-Plan-Plots-Course-to-an-All-Electric-Car-Future.html|title=Hawaii Plan Plots Course to an All-Electric Car Future|website=www.govtech.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric vehicles==
Through a cooperative effort with HECO, [[High Technology Development Corporation]] (HTDC), an agency of the State of Hawai’i, initiated the Hawai’i Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project (HEVDP) consortium to develop an [[electric vehicle]] industry in Hawai’i.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.htdc.org/aboutus/index.html High Technology Development Corporation &gt; About Us]&lt;/ref&gt; The islands have about 5,000 rechargeable vehicles.&lt;ref name=gtm2017-04/&gt;

==Future plans==
In 2015, the Hawaii State Legislature amended the State's [[Renewable Portfolio Standard]]s to establish the nation's first goal of 100% renewable energy: &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2015/bills/GM1197_.PDF Act 097, HB623 HD2 SD2 CD1], 2015 &lt;!--from http://governor.hawaii.gov/acts/act-097-hb623-hd2-sd2-cd1-06082015/ --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Javier Arau was born in [[Santa Monica, California]] and raised in [[Sacramento, California]]. He received scholarships to attend [[Lawrence University]] in 1993 and [[New England Conservatory]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erdmann|first1=Thomas|title=Saxophone Journal Cover Artist Feature Interview (July/August 2009)|url=http://www.javierarau.com/press/|publisher=Saxophone Journal|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received an Outstanding Performance Award in 1994, Extended Jazz Composition awards in 1996 and 2000, and a Jazz Arranging award in 2000 from DownBeat Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fine|first1=Eric|title=DownBeat Magazine Feature Interview (February 2011)|url=http://www.javierarau.com/press/|website=javierarau.com|publisher=Downbeat Magazine|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was the first-ever recipient of the ASCAP Young Jazz Composers Award, in 2002.

He has been featured the New York Times, DownBeat Magazine, on NBC TV's [[Today in New York]], and was the featured cover artist on the Saxophone Journal in August 2009. All About Jazz hailed, "Arau's 'Paper Train' is a marvelous bit of modern composition. Arau's 'Missouri Blues' toys with the edges of funk and fusion, and he puts grit into his tone to match. ...Good music based on strong roots.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sabbatini|first1=Mark|title=Grand Central: A Beautiful Friendship (2004)|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/a-beautiful-friendship-grand-central-review-by-mark-sabbatini.php|website=allaboutjazz.com|publisher=All About Jazz|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saxophone Journal noted, "Those who we remember best--Bach, Telemann, Vivaldi, Haydn and Mozart--did it all. Today there are very few who do it all, and an incredibly small proportion of them do it all extremely well. One who does is Javier Arau."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saxophone Journal|url=http://www.javierarau.com/press/#testimonials|website=javierarau.com|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he founded [[New York Jazz Academy]], a NYC-based music school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fine|first1=Eric|title=DownBeat Magazine Feature Interview (February 2011)|url=http://www.javierarau.com/press/|website=javierarau.com|publisher=Downbeat Magazine|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also leads the Javier Arau Jazz Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Javier Arau Jazz Orchestra|url=http://www.javierarau.com/javier-arau-jazz-orchestra/|website=javierarau.com|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Javier's compositions have received awards from ASCAP, BMI, DownBeat Magazine, and IAJE, and are published by UNC Jazz Press and Dorn Publications. At the age of 19, his transcription and analysis of [[Joe Henderson| Joe Henderson’s]] Grammy award-winning solo on [[Lush Life: The Music of Billy Strayhorn|Lush Life]] was published in IAJE’s Jazz Educators Journal, which became widely regarded as the definitive transcription of that iconic performance. Henderson got word of Javier's efforts and quickly became a mentor to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Javier Arau's Biography|url=http://www.javierarau.com/bio/|website=javierarau.com|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arau|first1=Javier|title=Joe Henderson's Lush Life Solo Transcription and Analysis|url=http://www.javierarau.com/lessons-blog/joe-henderson-lush-life-solo-transcription-and-analysis|website=javierarau.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arau has published his "Augmented Scale Theory,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arau|first1=Javier|title=Augmented Scale Theory|url=http://www.javierarau.com/augmented-scale-theory/|website=javierarau.com|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helps bridge the gap between the chromatic tendencies of modern jazz and the diatonic roots of traditional jazz harmony, enabling the improviser to play creatively over such challenging material as Coltrane’s “Giant Steps” and Wayne Shorter classics. His most recent book, a practice manual for all instruments, "365 Ways of Practicing Major Scales in Thirds"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=365 Ways of Practicing Major Scales in Thirds|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Practicing-Major-Scales-Thirds/dp/1419681079/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403279711&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=365+ways+of+practicing+major+scales+in+thirds|website=amazon.com|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is available in bookstores nationwide. Javier is currently writing a book entitled "Anatomy Of A Melody: A Jazz Improv Primer for All Instruments". Javier's Jelly and Jam Session, his extensive music outreach program, was licensed by the NYC Department of Education to be used in the public school music curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Javier's Jelly and Jam Session|url=https://www.amazon.com/Javiers-Jelly-Session-Javier-Arau/dp/B00009EBUQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403280020&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=javier%27s+jelly+and+jam+session|website=amazon.com|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before coming to Wesleyan, Bush took time off from his studies to work on George H. W. Bush's 1988 presidential campaign. As an EMT, Bush spent a summer vacation during college operating a 911-response ambulance in [[New Orleans]]. In 1991, Bush volunteered to become a [[combat medic]] at the start of [[Operation Desert storm|Operation Desert Storm]], doing boot camp at [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]] in [[South Carolina]], but did not ship out because the war ended before he finished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where Does It Hurt?: An Entrepreneur's Guide to Fixing Health Care|last=Bush|first=Jonathan|publisher=Portfolio/Penguin|year=2014|isbn=1591846773|location=New York, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The business side of Bush's training stemmed from his time as an associate of J. Bush &amp; Company, Inc., a firm founded by his father that assisted foreign embassies in banking, and as a consultant at [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], where he was a member of its Managed Care Strategy Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/3500316/banking-and-capital-markets-corporations/athenahealth-ceo-jonathan-bush-a-disruptive-force-in-health-care.html#.WYDhY4TytEY|title=Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush: A Disruptive Force in Health Care|website=www.institutionalinvestor.com|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== athenahealth ===
In 1997, Bush and [[Todd Park]], a colleague from Booz Allen, founded Athena Women's Health, a women's health and birthing clinic housed in San Diego for soon-to-be, new, and current mothers. After Park's brother Ed Park helped develop its system, Athena Women's Health transformed into athenahealth, a healthcare technology platform offering a suite of services to help hospital and ambulatory providers coordinate care and work at the tops of their licenses. In 2000, Bush raised more than $10 million in [[venture capital]] funding to support athenahealth,&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Ryan. January 22, 2007. "The Bush who pays the bills." ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''. Vol. 155, Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt; which launched a successful [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Cowan. September 21, 2007. "athenahealth IPO Soars 97%; Year's Best Debut Adds Some Zest To Slow September". ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' p.

'''Joseph William Drexel''' (January 24, 1833 – March 25, 1888) was a banker, philanthropist and [[book collector]].

==Early life==
He was the son of [[Francis Martin Drexel]] (1792–1863) and Catherine Hookey (1795–1870).  His siblings were [[Anthony Joseph Drexel]] (1826–1893) and [[Francis Anthony Drexel]] (1824–1885).  Through his brother Francis, he was the uncle of Saint [[Katharine Drexel]] (1858–1955).&lt;ref name="JWDObit1888"/&gt;

Drexel attended the [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]] in Philadelphia, and traveled through Spain, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and Greece.&lt;ref name="JWDObit1888"/&gt;

==Career==
Joseph Drexel was a partner in the firm of Drexel, Morgan and Company, where his brother, Anthony, was senior partner. In 1876, tired of battling the brusque [[J. Pierpont Morgan]], Joseph retired from the business and devoted his life to philanthropic and civic organizations.&lt;ref name="JWDObit1888"/&gt;

He owned a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm near New York City, where people without work were housed, clothed, fed, and taught agriculture until they could find a job. He owned a large tract of land in [[Maryland]], which was developed into [[Klej Grange]], a planned community, where the lots are sold to poor people at cost. About 7,000 acres (28&amp;nbsp;km²) in [[Michigan]] were bought for the same purpose.

===Society life===
He was chairman of New York Sanitary Commission, the commissioner of education, president of the [[New York Philharmonic Society]], trustee of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], founding trustee of the [[American Museum of Natural History]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirteen.org/programs/treasures-of-new-york/american-museum-of-natural-history "American Museum of Natural History," (episode in) ''Treasures of New York'' (PBS television series)].&lt;/ref&gt; trustee of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]], and director of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] house.&lt;ref name="JWDObit1888"/&gt;

In 1887, he donated a painting made by [[Edward Gay (artist)|Edward Gay]], that cost $2,000, to the State of New York to be placed in the [[New York State Executive Mansion|Executive Mansion]], which [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[David B. Hill]] was about to move into.&lt;ref name="Painting1887"&gt;{{cite news|title=THE NEW EXECUTIVE MANSION.; JOSEPH W.

===Collections===
Drexel was an avid collector of music, eventually amassing a collection of over 6,000 items.  Upon his death, the [[Drexel Collection]] was accepted by the [[Lenox Library (New York City)|Lenox Library]].&lt;ref name="1888Will"/&gt;  When the Lenox Library was joined with those of [[John Jacob Astor]] and [[Samuel Tilden]] to form The [[New York Public Library]], Drexel's collection became the basis for the Library's Music Division, housed today in the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]].

The ''Concordia Polka'' composed by Theodore Gundlach was dedicated to Drexel.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Gundlach. ''Concordia Polka.'' Philadelphia: R. Wittig, [no date].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mount McGregor===
In 1881, Drexel acquired title to [[Mount McGregor (mountain)|Mount McGregor]] near [[Saratoga Springs, New York]].  He constructed the Hotel Balmoral at the summit and built the [[Saratoga, Mount McGregor and Lake George Railroad]] [[narrow gauge railway]] from Saratoga Springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Mount McGregor|url=http://www.reocities.com/MotorCity/Downs/3548/facility/mtmcgregor.html|work=DOCS Today|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885, Drexel loaned his private summer cottage on Mount McGregor to ex-president [[Ulysses S. Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strength for General Grant|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/06/12/103022577.pdf|accessdate=August 5, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 12, 1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant lived there for six weeks until his death and completed his memoirs.  The cottage is now the [[Grant Cottage State Historic Site]].

==Personal life==
He married Lucy Wharton (1841–1912), the daughter of Thomas Lloyd Wharton (1799–1869) and Sarah Ann Smith (b. 1800).  Together, they had four children:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. J.W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6803">'''Juan José Muñoz''' (3 June 1950 – 8 May 2013) was an Argentine businessman. He was an advisor to the current Minister of Interior, Mr. Aníbal Fernández, during the period when the latter was a federal senator. Afterwards, he worked for the trade union that represents State Workers (the “Asociación Mutual de Trabajadores del Estado”, or AMTE).

Muñoz was born in [[La Plata]], [[Argentina]].  He was a self-made man, who rose from humble beginnings to become the owner of various agencies specializing in finances, tourism, and insurance, as well as a building company and a hotel chain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.ole.clarin.com/jsp/v4/pagina.jsp?pagId=1306524 Muñoz's background (in Spanish)]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, he was elected [[List of Presidents of Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata|President]] of the football club [[Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata]], the oldest club currently affiliated to the [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA). He occupied this position until the end of 2007, when a new management committee was chosen.

==Club management at Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}

During his mandate as President, the football club from La Plata, better known by its nickname of "El Lobo" (Spanish for “The Wolf”), exhibited two very contradictory faces.

==Positive aspects==

{{One source section|date=December 2015}}

At the beginning of Muñoz's tenure, the team was at the edge of relegation to second division. He spearheaded the decision to hire Pedro Troglio as coach, who was instrumental in turning around the performance by mid-2005. During the second half of that year, the team gelled in the Torneo Apertura 2005 and pulled off an excellent campaign which had it fighting neck-to-neck with Boca Juniors for the championship. Finally, Gimnasia crowned the effort by becoming a close runner-up, the fifth time the team obtained such honours in the ten years spanning 1995-2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arg06.html Torneo Apertura 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2006, Muñoz decided to withdraw the Nº 21 jersey, which was the number used by Pedro Troglio while playing in Gimnasia during the 1990s. This was the first time such a recognition was bestowed upon a club player in the Argentine football league.

==Negative aspects==

Despite the above successes, the club was also mired in controversy during Muñoz's tenure. Soon after becoming a president, he decided unilaterally to separate several team players from the main roster, including some iconic ones who had been part of the runner-up campaigns of the mid-1990s (e.g., Gustavo Barros Schelotto, Enzo Noce and Andrés Yllana),.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-47277-2005-02-13.html A wolf roams amidst the Forest of La Plata (In Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/subnotas/47277-16050-2005-02-13.html Marginalized by Mr. Muñoz (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005, the old Gimnasia stadium (known as '''El Bosque''', the Forest) became suspended after incidents that took place during a decisive game against [[Newell's Old Boys]]. As president, he made the decision to play temporarily in the much-debated "Estadio Ciudad de La Plata" venue. However, that temporary move soon became '''de facto''' permanent, after he refused to comply with the various reforms requested for the old stadium by the [[CoProSeDe]], the provincial organization in charge of security at sporting venues. Muñoz argued that the cost of making these reforms was “unsurmountable” (approximately 2 million Argentine pesos).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldia.com.ar/catalogo1/20060126/deportes9.asp Muñoz flip-flops and now Gimnasia will play in La Plata's new stadium (in Spanish)]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was resisted by many who demanded a return to El Bosque. After the end of Muñoz's mandate in 2007, the new management began finally the renovations; it is believed that Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata should be able to use the old field some time during 2008.

Other controversial events took place in 2006-2007. In October 2006, at half-time during a match against Boca Juniors in La Plata, Muñoz appeared in the dressing rooms, requesting to be able to talk to the referee and voice a number of complaints. The result was the suspension of the game by the referee, and a six-month reproof by the [[Asociación del Fútbol Argentino]] to the President of Gimnasia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/10/03/um/m-01283626.htm Soft disciplinary action against Gimnasia's president (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the continuation of this game, several weeks later, some Gimnasia players complained that they had been pressed by nondescript visitors who wished that Gimnasia would allow a victory by Boca, so as not to benefit archrivals Estudiantes. In the outcry that followed, Muñoz was widely considered responsible for these events.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20080108095448/http://old.ole.clarin.com/jsp/v4/pagina.jsp?pagId=1306754 "Officially" under pressure (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt; Gimnasia went on to lose the game 1-4, after leading 1-0 at the time of suspension.

Muñoz's tenure was also marked by the worst-ever defeat at a La Plata derby (a 0-7 fall against Estudiantes), as well as by the relegation of the once-powerful basketball team, following the withdrawal of strong financial support for this sport in the Club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.diariohoy.net/2006/10/13/pdf/c13-cla.pdf A renewed dream (in Spanish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210102727/http://pdf.diariohoy.net/2006/10/13/pdf/c13-cla.pdf |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan José Muñoz died on 8 May 2013 after a long illness. He was 62 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diagonales.infonews.com/nota-197369-Fallecio-Juan-Jose-Munoz.html Falleció Juan José Muñoz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615162452/http://diagonales.infonews.com/nota-197369-Fallecio-Juan-Jose-Munoz.html |date=2013-06-15 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The civil service is mainly organized around the state ministries, headed by a commissioner appointed by the Governor of Lagos state.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldfolio.com/news/olusola-oworu-commissioner-lagos-state-ministry-commerce-and-industry-nigeria-n1216/1216/|title=Nigeria - Honorable Commissioner for the Lagos State Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Mrs. Olusola|author=The Worldfolio|date=11 June 2012|work=theworldfolio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Governor's appointments are confirmed by the State House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/lagos-cabinet-fashola-submits-37-names-to-assembly/93964/|title=Lagos Cabinet: Fashola Submits 37 Names to Assembly , Articles - THISDAY LIVE|work=thisdaylive.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416183314/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/lagos-cabinet-fashola-submits-37-names-to-assembly/93964/|archivedate=2015-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawrence Alan Kudlow''' (born August 20, 1947) is an American financial analyst and former television host serving as Director of the [[National Economic Council (United States)|National Economic Council]] under President [[Donald Trump]] since 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/26/archives/june-16-bridal-set-by-nancy-gerstein.html |work=The New York Times |title=June 16 Bridal Set By Nancy Gerstein | date=May 26, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kudlow began his career as a junior financial analyst at the [[New York Federal Reserve]]. He soon left government to work on [[Wall Street]] at [[Paine Webber]] and [[Bear Stearns]] as a [[financial analyst]]. In 1981, after previously volunteering and working for [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] politicians and causes, Kudlow joined the administration of [[Ronald Reagan]] as associate director for economics and planning in the [[Office of Management and Budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/business/a-wall-st-star-s-agonizing-confession.html|title=A Wall St. Star's Agonizing Confession|first=Sylvia Nasar with Alison Leigh|last=Cowan|publisher=|accessdate=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the Reagan Administration during the second term, Kudlow returned to Wall Street and Bear Stearns, serving as the firm's chief economist from 1987 until 1994. During this time, he also advised the gubernatorial campaign of [[Christine Todd Whitman]] on economic issues. In the late 1990s, after a publicized battle with [[cocaine]] and [[alcohol]] [[addiction]], Kudlow left Wall Street to become an economic media commentator{{snd}}first with ''[[National Review]]'', and later hosting several shows on [[CNBC]].

Kudlow returned to politics in 2018, serving as [[Gary Cohn (investment banker)|Gary Cohn]]'s replacement at the [[National Economic Council (United States)|National Economic Council]].

==Early life==
Kudlow was born and raised in [[New Jersey]], the son of Ruth (née Grodnick) and Irving Howard Kudlow.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Who's Who, 1983–84|author1=Europa Publications Limited|author2=International Publications Service|date=1983|publisher=Europa Publications Limited|isbn=9780905118864|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xJ4R0t9G3oC}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family is [[Jewish]]. Kudlow attended the private [[Elisabeth Morrow School]] in [[Englewood, New Jersey]] until 6th grade. He then attended the private [[Dwight-Englewood School]] from the second half of [[middle school]] to high school.&lt;ref&gt;"The Interview: Lawrence Kudlow", from ''[[The American Spectator]]'', March 2001. "I remember that in this little prep school that I went to, the Dwight Englewood School in New Jersey, we had to say the Lord's Prayer in homeroom."&lt;/ref&gt;

Kudlow graduated from [[University of Rochester]] in [[Rochester, New York]], with a degree in history in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochester.edu/pr/Review/V65N2/feature5.html |title=Rochester Review: The Optimist Reigns Again |publisher=Rochester.edu |date= |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as "Kuddles" to friends, he was a star on the tennis team, and a member of the left-wing [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] at Rochester.

In 1971, Kudlow attended [[Princeton University]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]], where he studied politics and economics. He left before completing his master's degree.&lt;ref name=Andrews1995&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Suzanna|title=The Hollow Man|work=New York Magazine|issue=28(44)|date=Nov 6, 1995|pages=34–40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOQCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private sector career==

=== Financial industry ===
In 1987, Kudlow was hired by [[Bear Stearns]] as its chief economist and senior managing director. Kudlow also served as an economic counsel to A. B. Laffer &amp; Associates, the [[San Diego, California]], company owned by [[Arthur Laffer]], a major [[supply-side]] [[economist]] and promoter of the "[[Laffer curve]]", an economic measure of the relationship between tax levels and government revenue. Kudlow was fired from Bear Stearns in the mid-1990s due to his cocaine addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/larry-kudlow-cocaine-habit-john-kelly-1990s-2018-3?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=The '90s were 'a crazy time': John Kelly suggests Larry Kudlow's past cocaine addiction won't bar him from obtaining security clearance|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOQCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=kudlow+cocaine&amp;ei=VCR0S9XdEpG2NJDq0bsE&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=New York Magazine|first=New York Media|last=LLC|date=November 6, 1995|publisher=New York Media, LLC|accessdate=May 9, 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[board of directors]] of [[Empower America]], a supply-side economics organization founded in 1993 and merged in 2004 with the [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]] to form [[FreedomWorks]]. Kudlow is also a founding member of the Board of Advisors for the [[Independent Institute]] and consulting chief economist for American Skandia Life Assurance, Inc., in [[Connecticut]], a subsidiary of [[insurance]] giant [[Prudential Financial]].

=== Media ===
Kudlow became Economics Editor at [[National Review Online]] (NRO) in May 2001. In December 2007, NRO published a Kudlow article entitled ''Bush Boom Continues'', in which he asserted the economy would continue to expand for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2007/12/bush-boom-continues-larry-kudlow/|title=Bush Boom Continues |date=December 10, 2007|publisher=National Review|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Recession]], the worst economic downturn since the [[Great Depression]], began that month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nber.org/cycles.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Kudlow served as one of a rotating set of hosts on the CNBC show ''[[America Now]]'', which began airing in November 2001. In May 2002, that show was renamed ''[[Kudlow &amp; Cramer]]'', and Kudlow and [[Jim Cramer]] became the permanent hosts. In January 2005, Cramer left to host his own show, ''[[Mad Money]]'', and the program's name was changed the next month to ''[[Kudlow &amp; Company]]''. The program went on hiatus in October 2008, and returned in January 2009 as ''[[The Kudlow Report]]'', which ended its run on CNBC in March 2014. Kudlow added co-anchor of CNBC's ''[[The Call (CNBC)|The Call]]'' to his responsibilities in late 2008. Kudlow's style is boldly assertive and his line of argument is always framed in expressions of optimism about the economy, the stock market, and the dollar.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Kudlow is also a regular guest on ''[[Squawk Box]]''. He has contributed to CNBC.com on [[MSN]]. He also appeared on ''The [[John Batchelor]] Show'' as a co-host on Tuesdays and as a substitute, until leaving those duties to become an economics advisor to President Trump. In March 2006, Kudlow started to host a [[talk radio]] show on politics and economics on [[WABC (AM)]] as "The Larry Kudlow Show" aired on Saturday mornings from 10am to 1pm ET and via nationwide syndication starting June 5, 2010. ''The Larry Kudlow Show'' was syndicated by [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]]. He started a blog named ''[http://www.moneypolitics.net Kudlow's Money Politic$]'' in October 2004.

He has also contributed to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[Washington Times]]'', the ''[[Cato Journal]]'' of the [[Cato Institute]], and the ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'' of the [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]], as well as the television show ''[[The McLaughlin Group]]'', and has appeared as a guest on ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'' and on ''[[Wall Street Week]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} &lt;!---

==Government and political career==
In 1970, while he was still a Democrat, Kudlow joined [[Joseph Duffey]]'s "New Politics" senatorial campaign in Connecticut. Duffey was a leading [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war politician during the Vietnam war era]]. Kudlow, working with [[Yale University]] law student [[Bill Clinton]] as well as many other rising young [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] students, was known as a "brilliant" district coordinator.&lt;ref name="Andrews1995" /&gt; Kudlow worked on the U.S. Senate campaign of [[Joseph Duffey]], along with [[Bill Clinton]], [[John Podesta]], and [[Michael Medved]], another future conservative, and in 1976, he worked on the U.S. Senate campaign of [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], along with [[Tim Russert]], against [[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative Party]] incumbent [[James L. Buckley]], brother of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Right Turns: Unconventional Lessons from a Controversial Life|last=Medved|first=Michael|publisher=Crown Forum|year=2004|isbn=1-4000-5187-8|location=New York|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kudlow began his career as a staff economist at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]], taking a position "as a junior economist in a job.&lt;ref name="Andrews1995" /&gt; He worked in the division of the Fed that handled [[open market operations]].

During the first term of the [[Reagan administration]] (1981–1985), Kudlow was associate director for economics and planning in the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB), a part of the [[Executive Office of the President]]. While he worked at the OMB, Kudlow was also an advisory committee member of the [[Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation]], more commonly known as [[Freddie Mac]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} In April 2005, New York Governor [[George Pataki]] included Kudlow in a six-member state tax commission.

Kudlow's name was floated by Republicans as a potential Senate candidate in either [[United States Senate election in Connecticut, 2016|Connecticut]] or [[United States Senate election in New York, 2016|New York]] in [[United States Senate elections, 2016|2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/420242/larry-kudlow-nrsc-senate-bid-ny-ct|title=Larry Kudlow and NRSC Renew Discussions on Senate Run|last=Johnson|first=Eliana|date=June 24, 2015|work=[[National Review]]|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, U.S. Senator [[Richard Blumenthal]], in an email to supporters, attacked Kudlow as "a champion of big corporations and big money" despite Kudlow's not announcing a run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctmirror.org/2015/11/04/blumenthal-campaign-targets-potential-rival-kudlow-over-actual-candidate-wolf/|title=Blumenthal campaign targets potential rival Kudlow over actual candidate Wolf|website=Ctmirror.org|accessdate=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early December 2015, [[Jack Fowler (publisher)|Jack Fowler]] of [[National Review]] created a 527 organization that encouraged Kudlow to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patch.com/connecticut/weston-ct/redding-resident-being-lobbied-run-us-senate-against-blumenthal|title=Redding Resident Being Lobbied to Run for U.S. Senate Against Blumenthal|date=December 6, 2015|website=Patch.com|accessdate=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jobsforct.com/|title=Jobs for Connecticut|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211081629/https://www.jobsforct.com/|archivedate=December 11, 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=March 15, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Kudlow said that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was untrustworthy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/04/17/trumps-top-economic-adviser-never-believe-the-cbo-never-believe-them/|title=Analysis {{!}} Trump’s top economic adviser: ‘Never believe the CBO … never believe them’|last=Stein|first=Jeff|date=2018-04-17|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dismissed CBO's estimate that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would increase the deficit by $1.3 trillion, saying, "Never believe the CBO. Very important: Never believe them. They're always wrong, especially with regard to tax cuts, which they never score properly."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All credible studies of the tax plan, whether by non-partisan organizations, Wall Street analysts, or right-leaning research organizations, showed that the tax plan would increase the deficit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In July 2018, Kudlow falsely asserted that "Even the CBO numbers show now that the entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP." The CBO actually found that the tax cut reduces revenues and that deficits would increase by $1.9 trillion after accounting for macroeconomic feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/31/larry-kudlow/wh-economic-chief-kudlow-wrongly-says-cbo-agrees-t/|title=WH's Kudlow wrongly says CBO says tax cuts paid for|publisher=|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in April, Kudlow alleged that [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]] [[Nikki Haley]] had announced that the U.S. would soon sanction [[Russia]] due to "momentary confusion". After Haley contradicted Kudlow's claim, Kudlow called Haley to apologize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/larry-kudlow-apologizes-nikki-haley-over-russia-sanctions-remark-n866916|title=Larry Kudlow apologizes to Nikki Haley over Russia sanctions remark|last=Associated Press|date=2018-04-18|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Trump celebrated the six-month anniversary of the tax cut on June 29, 2018, Kudlow asserted that the tax cut was generating such growth that "it's throwing off enormous amount[s] of new tax revenues", and "the deficit, which was one of the other criticisms, is coming down – and it's coming down rapidly". Both assertions were incorrect. Since the tax cut was enacted, federal tax receipts increased 1.9% on a year-on-year basis, while they increased 4.0% during the comparable period in 2017. By the same method, the federal budget deficit increased 37.8% while it increased 16.4% during the comparable period in 2017. [[Kevin Hassett]], chairman of Trump's [[Council of Economic Advisers]], noted days earlier that the deficit was "skyrocketing", which is consistent with the analysis of every reputable budget analyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/06/29/larry-kudlow-and-the-white-house-now-claim-the-growing-deficit-is-actually-dropping-and-rapidly/|title=Analysis – Trump’s top economic adviser makes a laughable claim about a very basic economic number|last=Blake|first=Aaron|date=June 29, 2018|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=kkpF|title=Federal Surplus or Deficit |date=June 12, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kudlow later asserted he was referring to future deficits, although every credible budget forecast indicates increasing deficits in coming years, made worse by the Trump tax cut if not offset by major spending cuts. Barring such spending cuts, the CBO projected the tax cut would add $1.27 trillion in deficits over the next decade, even after considering any economic growth the tax cut might generate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/29/trumps-top-economic-adviser-says-deficit-is-coming-down-rapidly-contradicting-all-available-data/|title=Analysis – Trump's top economic adviser says deficit 'is coming down rapidly', contradicting virtually all available data|first=Jeff|last=Stein|date=June 29, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kudlow asserted on June 29, 2018, that "capital investment, you know, for new jobs and better careers, [is] flowing in from all corners of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/06/29/larry-kudlow-and-the-white-house-now-claim-the-growing-deficit-is-actually-dropping-and-rapidly/|title=Analysis – Trump’s top economic adviser makes a laughable claim about a very basic economic number|first=Aaron|last=Blake|date=June 29, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[foreign direct investment]] – the total flow of investment capital into the United States from the rest of the world – declined 35% on a year-on-year basis during the first quarter after the tax cut, the most recent data available. That was consistent with the 37% decline during Trump's first five quarters in office, compared to the five quarters immediately preceding his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=kiZy&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2018, Kudlow stated, "This is now, the USA, according to the [[OECD]], the hottest economy in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/06/29/larry-kudlow-and-the-white-house-now-claim-the-growing-deficit-is-actually-dropping-and-rapidly/|title=Analysis  Trump’s top economic adviser makes a laughable claim about a very basic economic number|first=Aaron|last=Blake|date=June 29, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=June 30, 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not a new phenomenon under the Trump presidency, as by 2015 the American GDP growth rate had been almost twice that of other industrialized countries since 2008, and by 2015 America had created as many jobs than all other industrialized countries combined since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-strongest-most-durable-ec/|title=Barack Obama says U.S. has 'strongest, most durable economy in the world' during State of the Union|publisher=|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/17/482328208/u-s-economic-recovery-looks-good-compared-with-sluggish-europe-asia|title=U.S. Economic Recovery Looks Good Compared With Sluggish Europe, Asia|date=June 17, 2016|publisher=NPR|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kudlow also asserted: "They've been saying that all along, OK?

[[File:Larry Kudlow 1981.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kudlow in 1981]]

=== Economy ===
A self-described "[[Reaganomics|Reagan]] [[supply side|supply-sider]]", Kudlow is known for his support for tax cuts and deregulation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21738909-larry-kudlow-quintessential-member-republican-partys-business-wing-president|title=President Trump appoints a new economic adviser|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'', Kudlow is "the quintessential member of the Republican Party's business wing".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kudlow has no formal economics qualifications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1993, Kudlow predicted that [[Bill Clinton]]'s tax increases would dampen economic growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When the economy boomed in the late-1990s, Kudlow credited it to tax cuts enacted during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration (1981–1989)]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He has also advocated that [[Defined contribution|employees be compelled to make greater contributions]] to their pension and medical costs, suggesting that these expenses are an undue burden on businesses and defends high executive compensation as a manifestation of market forces and opposes most forms of government regulation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In general, he has described himself as a [[Supply-Side Economics|supply-side economist]], arguing that reducing tax rates will encourage economic growth and ultimately increase tax revenue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He has often argued that economic growth will clear deficits, while acknowledging the limits of growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He has also advocated wide ownership of stocks and has frequently spoken of a broad "investor class" that includes most Americans.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Kudlow was a strong advocate of [[George W. Bush]]'s substantial tax cuts, and argued that the tax cuts would lead to an economic boom of equal magnitude.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the implementation of the Bush tax cuts, Kudlow insisted year after year that the economy was in the middle of a "Bush boom", and chastised other commentators for failing to realize it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kudlow firmly denied that the United States would enter a [[Great Recession|recession in 2007]], or that it was in the midst of a recession in early to mid-2008. In December 2007, he wrote: "The recession debate is over. It's not gonna happen. Time to move on. At a bare minimum, we are looking at Goldilocks 2.0. (And that's a minimum). The Bush boom is alive and well. It's finishing up its sixth splendid year with many more years to come".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlows-money-politics/2452/recession-debate-over-larry-kudlow |title=The Recession Debate Is Over |work=National Review Online |date=December 5, 2007 |accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2008 column entitled "'R' is for 'Right'", Kudlow wrote: "President George W. Bush may turn out to be the top economic forecaster in the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Larry |last=Kudlow |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDM0OGU3Nzk0MTMyMGI3NTU1Y2JmYWVhOWU3OTU4ZGQ= |title=Bush’s ‘R’ Is for ‘Right’ |work=National Review |date=May 2, 2008 |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2008, Kudlow continued to deny that the economy was looking poor, insisting that "We are in a mental recession, not an actual recession".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/blog/kudlows-money-politics/if-things-are-so-bad-larry-kudlow/|title=If Things Are So Bad . . . |date=2008-07-25|work=National Review|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, creating a full-blown international [[banking crisis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As George W. Bush took office in January 2001, America was in the fourth consecutive fiscal year of federal budget surpluses&lt;ref name="stlouisfed.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=k91g|title=Federal Surplus or Deficit [-]|date=March 27, 2018|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank, St. Louis|accessdate=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CBO projected increasing surpluses in each year through 2010, totaling over $5 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/107th-congress-2001-2002/reports/entire-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Days before Bush signed his tax cut plan in June, Kudlow predicted it would cause future budget surpluses to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2001/05/looking-down-road-larry-kudlow/|title=Looking Up, Down The Road |work=National Review|date=May 29, 2001|accessdate=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, there were budget deficits in every fiscal year of the Bush administration.&lt;ref name="stlouisfed.org" /&gt;

In their 2015 book ''[[Superforecasting]]'', University of Pennsylvania political scientist [[Philip E. Tetlock]] and Dan Gardner refer to Kudlow as a "consistently wrong" pundit, and use Kudlow's long record of failed predictions to clarify common mistakes that poor forecasters make.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=45OmCQAAQBAJ|title=Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction |last=Tetlock |first=Philip |last2=Gardner |first2=Dan |date=2015-09-24 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-1-4481-6659-6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/kudlow-trump-nafta-catastrophe-1.4576572|title=Cancelling NAFTA would be a 'calamitously bad decision', says Trump's new economic adviser|publisher=CBC News|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He supported free trade prior to his White House appointment, but upon his appointment said that he supported President Trump's [[Trump tariffs#Steel and aluminum|steel and aluminum tariffs]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kudlow is not known as a [[deficit hawk]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After the 2018 G7 Summit in Charlevoix, Canada, he attacked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a candid interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, saying that Trudeau had "stabbed us in the back".

On June 26, 2002, in a commentary in NRO titled "Taking Back the Market – By Force",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205232/taking-back-market-force-larry-kudlow|title=Taking Back the Market – By Force|last=Kudlow|first=Larry|date=June 26, 2002|accessdate=December 15, 2016|publisher=National Review Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kudlow called for the United States to attack [[Iraq]], stating that [[Saddam Hussein]] had "weapons of mass destruction at his disposal" and that "a lack of decisive follow-through in the global war on terrorism is the single biggest problem facing the stock market and the nation today". In an open letter dated February 12, 2003, he endorsed [[George W. Bush]]'s policies on economic growth and jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030212-2.html|title=Letter to the President on economic growth|date=February 12, 2003|publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Kudlow endorsed Republican Presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]]. He later defended [[Executive Order 13767|Trump's plan to rebuild the existing wall]] along the [[Mexico–United States barrier]], declaring it was necessary to prevent terrorists from entering the United States, the United States was at war with [[ISIS]] and Trump was going to do what was necessary to protect the country. He also penned an article for [[RealClearPolitics]] advocating for conservative unity in the election and asking his conservative peers to stop criticizing Trump and instead help him become a stronger candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/04/25/larry_kudlow_a_plea_to_my_conservative_brethren.html |title=A Plea to My Conservative Brethren |publisher=Real Clear Politics |date=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Kudlow left Bear Stearns and entered a [[twelve-step program]] in order to deal with his addictions to [[cocaine]] and alcohol. He subsequently converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] under the guidance of [[C. John McCloskey|Father C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34025">This article lists the orders made by airlines and other buyers for the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] family of aircraft, which is currently being produced by [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]], a division of the [[Boeing|Boeing Company]].

Initially, the customers for the 737 MAX were not disclosed, except for [[American Airlines]]. On November 17, 2011, Boeing released the names of two other customers – [[Lion Air]] and [[Aviation Capital Group]]. At that time, Boeing reported 700 commitments from nine customers for the 737 MAX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/lion-air-commits-to-up-to-380-boeing-737s-365027/ |title=Lion Air commits to up to 380 Boeing 737s |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/acg-becomes-third-identified-737-max-customer-365044/ |title= ACG Becomes third identified 737 MAX customer |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on December 13, 2011, [[Southwest Airlines]] announced they would be the launch customer for the 737 MAX with a firm order of 150 aircraft and 150 options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000119312511342458/d271438dex991.htm |title=Southwest Airlines Will Become Launch Customer for the New Boeing 737 Max Aircraft |date=December 13, 2011|publisher=Southwest Airlines Co.

{{As of|2018|9|30|df=US}}, Boeing had 4,783 firm orders from 98 identified customers for the 737 MAX,&lt;ref name="Boeing737_O_D"/&gt; and the top three identified airline customers for the 737 MAX are: [[Southwest Airlines]] with 310 orders, [[Flydubai]] with 251 orders, and [[Lion Air]] with 251 orders.&lt;ref name="Boeing737_O_D" /&gt;

The '''Malaysia Australia Business Council''' (MABC) is a non-profit business chamber founded in 1986 with the aim of promoting the interests of its members based in [[Malaysia]] with business links to [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mabc.org.my&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://malaysia.highcommission.gov.au/klpr/trade_mabc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As an active business chamber, the council provides a forum for Malaysian and Australian linked businesses and business people.  The MABC works closely with the governments of both countries and plays an active role in developing the bilateral relationship.  It is led by an Executive Committee made up of prominent business people from both countries.  It's co-patrons are the [[Mustapa Mohamed|Malaysian Minister of Trade &amp; Industry]] and the Australian High Commissioner.

The MABC works closely with its sister organisation in Australia, the Australia Malaysia Business Council (AMBC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ambc.org.au/mabc/&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the MABC has seen a growth in activity due to the signing of the Malaysia Australia Free Trade Agreement (MAFTA) which has resulted in increasing bilateral trade between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2015/06/24/More-Aussie-firms-choose-Msia-as-export-destination-says-MABC/?style=biz&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheehy resigned as Lieutenant Governor and withdrew from the race in February 2013 after the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' discovered that he had made 2,300 phone calls on a state-issued phone, many of them long and at night, to four women, none of whom were his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20130203/NEWS/702039876#sheehy-steps-aside-after-phone-records-reveal-2-300-calls-to-4-women|title=Sheehy steps aside after phone records reveal 2,300 calls to 4 women|date=February 4, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2013|work=Omaha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the month, Flood was reported to be reconsidering his decision with his wife progressing well in her treatment. In July he announced that he would not re-enter the race.&lt;ref name=floodout/&gt;

Cattle rancher Charles Herbster, who had not formally entered the race but had been campaigning since July, became the third Republican to withdraw when he withdrew on August 23. He cited the health of his wife, who had recently undergone heart surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20130823/NEWS/130829502/1688#surprises-in-governor-s-race-herbster-out-mccoy-in|title=Surprises in governor's race: Herbster out; McCoy in|date=August 24, 2013|accessdate=August 27, 2013|work=Omaha.com|author=Robynn Tysver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Omaha businessman [[Pete Ricketts]] joined the race.  Ricketts, a former chief operating officer of [[Ameritrade]] and the son of company founder [[Joe Ricketts]], had run unsuccessfully in 2006 for the U.S. Senate seat held by [[Ben Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Don.

Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

State Senator [[Charlie Janssen]], who had lagged in endorsements and fundraising, withdrew from the race on February 3, 2014. He said: "The way the field was shaping up, I didn't see a clear path to victory."&lt;ref name=abandons&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20140203/NEWS/140209627/1685#charlie-janssen-abandons-his-bid-for-governor|title=Charlie Janssen abandons his bid for governor|date=February 3, 2014|accessdate=February 3, 2014|work=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|first=Robynn|last=Tysver}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later declared his candidacy for State Auditor.

In February 2014, state attorney general [[Jon Bruning]] announced that he was joining the race.  His entry made him the perceived front-runner, supplanting Ricketts, who had been regarded as the leading contender up to that time.&lt;ref name=bruningtorun&gt;Tsyver, Robynn.

In the May 13 Republican primary, Ricketts narrowly defeated Bruning, with 26.5% of the vote to Bruning's 25.5%.  His 1-point margin of victory made this the closest Republican gubernatorial primary in 92 years, since the 1922 primary in which Charles Randall defeated [[Adam McMullen]] by 0.6 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2014/05/14/ricketts-wins-nebraska-gop-gub/ |title= Ricketts Wins Nebraska GOP Gubernatorial Nod with Lowest Support in State History |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date= May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
===September 1 debate===
Chuck Hassebrook and Pete Ricketts sparred over education policy, economics and full-time residency in Lincoln at the Nebraska State Fair. Hassebrook opposed school vouchers for public school students, suggesting that tax dollars should be used to improve public schools. Ricketts countered that a gradual voucher policy would help students while keeping money in public schools. The duo showed stark differences in economic policy, with Hassebrook supporting a minimum wage increase and Ricketts opposing an increased wage. Moderator Mike'l Severe asked both candidates if they would reside in the [[Nebraska Governor's Mansion|governor's mansion]] full-time if elected. Ricketts, who has three children attending school in Omaha, said that he had not made a final decision on the question. Hassebrook stated that Nebraska needs a "full-time governor" and that he would live in Lincoln because "40 hours a week is a vacation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omaha.com/news/metro/hassebrook-ricketts-debate-nebraska-s-governor-candidates-display-stark-choice/article_be2fa1fc-3233-11e4-95b5-0017a43b2370.html ''Omaha.com,'' "Hassebrook-Ricketts debate: Nebraska's governor candidates display stark choice voters will face," September 2, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2 debate===
The two candidates traded barbs over past positions in a debate sponsored by Nebraska Educational Communications. Hassebrook accused Ricketts of supporting [[Dave Heineman|Gov. Dave Heineman's]] (R) tax proposal in 2013, which would have increased sales tax rates. The Platte Institute, a conservative think-tank created by Ricketts, supported the tax proposal, which ultimately failed to pass in the face of increasing public criticism. Hassebrook argued that Ricketts tried to hide his support for the measure when he decided to run for governor. Ricketts denied support for the bill, noting that he did not agree with every position taken by the institute.&lt;ref name=oct2&gt;[http://www.omaha.com/news/politics/in-debate-nebraska-governor-candidates-offer-contrasting-views-on-prison/article_35e3e5de-4a9c-11e4-b7a3-0017a43b2370.html ''Omaha.com,'' " In their last debate before election, Nebraska governor candidates try to build contrasts," October 2, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricketts countered by bringing up a report co-authored by Hassebrook in 1990 that called for a ban on exports of [[genetically modified crops]]. The issue of biotechnology in farming has grown in prominence due to the importance of Nebraska's agricultural sector. Hassebrook responded that he provided little assistance to the authors of the report, and was wrongly credited as a co-author. He also noted that he supported biotechnology research since the early 1990s, when he served on the University of Nebraska Board of Regents.&lt;ref name=oct2/&gt;

Debate viewers also saw Hassebrook and Ricketts stake out distinct positions on immigration and the proposed [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone XL]] pipeline that would run through Nebraska. Hassebrook advocated for allowing driving licenses for children brought to the country illegally, while Ricketts opposed issuing licenses as a matter of protecting existing laws. Ricketts suggested that the XL Pipeline would bring jobs to the state and securely transport oil across the country, citing problems with rail transportation of oil. Hassebrook opposed the pipeline because he suggested the project would contribute to climate change.&lt;ref name=oct2/&gt;

'''Paulo Salim Maluf''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈpawlu saˈlĩ maˈlufi}}; born September 3, 1931) is a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] politician with a career spanning over four decades and many functions, including those of State Governor of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Mayor of the [[São Paulo|City of São Paulo]], [[National Congress of Brazil|Congressman]] and [[President of Brazil|Presidential candidate]]. As of 2011, Maluf is on a second consecutive term as [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Federal Deputy]]. His political base is founded on [[populism]] and the provision of major [[public work]]s.

His career has been plagued with substantial allegations of [[political corruption|corruption]], although he was only convicted by Brazilian Courts in 2017. He spent a few months in jail and is now under house arrest due to his poor health and advanced age.

He is the president of the local branch, in the [[state of São Paulo]], of the right-wing [[Progressive Party of Brazil]] (PP), heir to the old [[National Renewal Alliance Party]] (ARENA). [[Interpol]] has issued a [[Interpol notice|Red Notice]] to arrest Maluf, extradite him and try him in the United States on charges of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and criminal possession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpol.int/Wanted-Persons/(wanted_id)/2009-13608 Interpol Red Notice for Paulo Maluf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/noticias/10-brasileiros-procurados-pela-interpol-no-mundo-inteiro The 10 Interpol Most-Wanted Brazilians in the World].  Retrieved May 17, 2013 (in Portuguese).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Paulo Salim [[Maalouf|Maluf]], the son of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Christian immigrants Salim Farah Maluf and Maria Stephan Maluf, was born in [[São Paulo]], and graduated 1954 in engineering at the [[University of São Paulo]] (USP), where coincidentally he was a colleague of the late [[Mário Covas]], another important Brazilian politician who would later become one of his biggest political rivals.

At the time a self-acknowledged playboy with a taste for fast-racing [[sportscar]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the self-congratulatory long interview to Tão Gomes Pinto, ''Ele : Maluf, trajetória da audácia '', São Paulo: Ediouro, 2008, {{ISBN|978-85-00-02401-6}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Maluf entered professional politics thanks to his family's friendship with the then [[Military dictatorship|military president]] [[Artur da Costa e Silva]], with whom he shared a common interest in [[Horse racing]] bets.&lt;ref&gt;John Tofik Karam, ''Another arabesque: Syrian-Lebanese ethnicity in neoliberal Brazil'', Philadelphia: Temple Unioversity Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59213-540-4}}, page 50&lt;/ref&gt; Banking on this friendship, he was to be appointed mayor of [[São Paulo]] in 1969, replacing the very popular [[José Vicente Faria Lima|Faria Lima]]. In a manner very similar to [[New York City|New York]]’s [[Robert Moses]], he suspended the construction of the [[São Paulo Metro]] and built one of the most controversial constructions of Brazil: [[Costa e Silva]] elevated [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]], also known as ''Minhocão'' (“Big [[Earthworm]]” in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). This expressway is seen as responsible for the degradation of a great area of [[Downtown São Paulo|São Paulo’s downtown]] by placing a high-traffic elevated road in the middle of a residential area and is considered as the hallmark of the [[Military dictatorship (Brazil)|military dictatorship]]'s – and Maluf's – authoritarian, road enhancement&lt;ref&gt;Ivani Vassoler, ''Urban Brazil: visions, afflictions, and governance lessons''. Youngstown, Cambria Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-934043-94-3}}, page 140&lt;/ref&gt; and private-car-friendly urban policies in São Paulo – its building being made possible only by the impossibility of a public reaction to it on the surrounding community's side.&lt;ref&gt;Heitor Frúgoli Jr., ''Centralidade em São Paulo: trajetórias, conflitos e negociações na metrópole ''. São Paulo: Edusp, 2000, {{ISBN|85-314-0966-7}}, page 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsuccessful Contender for the Presidency==
[[File:Figueiredo e Maluf.jpg|thumb|Maluf with President [[João Figueiredo]] in the 1980s.]] 
In 1972, following his mayorship, he served as secretary of transport of the state of São Paulo. He would then dispute a convention of the dictatorship's ruling party, [[Aliança Renovadora Nacional|ARENA]] – which was supposed to be a rubber-stamping caucus aimed at choosing as official "candidate" to the state government the former governor Laudo Natel. Maluf, however, succeed in being appointed official candidate&lt;ref&gt;José Nêumanne Pinto, ''A República na Lama''. São Paulo: 1992, pages 37/38&lt;/ref&gt; for the following indirect elections by the State Legislative – something he did by means of abundant personal (and generous) promises to the convention's members&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Skidmore]], ''Brasil: De Castelo a Tancredo''. Portuguese trans. of ''The Politics of Military Rule in Brazil, 1964–1985''. São Paulo: Paz e Terra, 1988, pages 475/476&lt;/ref&gt; – being afterwards elected governor for the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] in 1978.

During his ensuing term (1979–1983), Maluf used his position for advertising his prospective candidacy to the Presidency in the forthcoming 1985 indirect elections, by means mostly of schemes such as donation of ambulances to impoverished municipalities in Northeastern Brazil, as well as decorating influential people with the State's chief decoration – having them flown to São Paulo free of charge and lodged in luxury hotels before the official decoration ceremony. He also spent wildly in public works, including in some schemes of doubtful validity, such as in an eventually failed plan to move the state's capital city.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, ''Brazil de Castelo a Tancredo'', 476&lt;/ref&gt; It was because of such schemes that one of the most notable accusations of corruption against him emerged, concerning the [[oil company]] [[Paulipetro]]. This was a state company founded by Maluf during his tenure as governor with the purpose of digging the state for [[Petroleum|oil]] and which consumed around US$500 million whilst drilling 21 holes and finding nothing but a few pockets of [[natural gas]] and water. By then, Maluf had already fostered a reputation "for engaging in corrupt machine politics".&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, ''Brazil de Castelo a Tancredo'', 476; Ted George Goertzel, ''Fernando Henrique Cardoso: reinventing democracy in Brazil ''. Boulder: Lynne Riener, 1999, {{ISBN|1-55587-831-8}}, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he was elected federal deputy with a then national record 672&amp;nbsp;629 votes and came to stand as the military's preferred presidential candidate for the 1985 presidential elections – the last to be held by means of an Electoral College – where he stood a good chance of winning. His overweening strategy, however, estranged him from most of the party bosses – the civilian caucus which had provided political support to the military dictatorship in the last twenty years. That caused his PDS party (as the current PP was known at the time) to splinter into the [[Democrats (Brazil)|PFL]], a move that made good the mutual alienation between the ruling military scheme and its civilian base,&lt;ref&gt;When the Minister of the Air Force called former PDS bigwig and former governor of [[Bahia]] [[Antônio Carlos Magalhães]], a "traitor", for supporting Tancredo, Magalhães replied in an angry note stating that "a traitor is someone who supports a corrupt": cf. Skidmore, ''Brasil de Castelo a Tancredo'', 485/486&lt;/ref&gt; something which resulted in the election of opposition candidate [[Tancredo Neves]].

==Post-dictatorship career and political resilience==

Since then, Maluf only managed to get himself elected to the Executive once, in 1992, again as mayor of [[São Paulo]], despite his participation in nearly every gubernatorial and mayoral election for [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]] and [[São Paulo|São Paulo city]], with the exception of 1989 when he was a presidential candidate in the first direct presidential elections since 1960 – in what was a disastrous campaign, remembered in Brazilian political lore only because of Maluf's "antic", said at a speech made to Medical Faculty students in [[Belo Horizonte]]: declaring himself favourable to [[capital punishment]] in cases of rape followed by murder, he said jokingly that "if one has sexual urges, that's okay; rape, but do not kill!" (''estupra mas não mata'').&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Maurício Lara, ''Campanha de rua: a cobertura jornalística de uma eleição presidencial''.São Paulo: Geração Editorial, 1994 pg.61. Available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIeV0kHMGG0C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=maluf+estupra&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xS_pS8PTKZCOuAeHhMSpCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=maluf%20estupra&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Maluf remained a regional political force in São Paulo, the election of [[Celso Pitta]] as [[São Paulo|São Paulo city]] mayor being directly attributed to his endorsement. When he ended his last mayoral term in 1996, he was considered the best mayor São Paulo had ever had up until then, receiving an 80% approval rate. In 2011, a survey by the Datafolha research firm, after asking, again, a sample of São Paulo locals about who would be the best mayor the city had ever had, obtained the result that Maluf stood first with 47% of the sample's preferences.

Such high rates of local approval stand as a reflection of the fact that Maluf was able to forge himself a successful career in post-dictatorship Brazil, despite his perennial reputation for shady deals and for an unsavory personality&lt;ref&gt;Cf., among others, Emir Sader &amp; Ken Silverstein,''Without fear of being happy: Lula, the Workers Party and Brazil ''.

Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-42422-4}}, page 262, available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=mkfEamELMFAC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=paulo+maluf+unsavory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aDfpS_qzDYuGuAe_nZG2Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=paulo%20maluf%20unsavory&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; This has led various scholars to try to explain his political resilience. To some, this resilience is of an ideological nature: having his career nurtured in a right-wing military dictatorship, Maluf came to stand for a kind of reactionary activism, especially strong among small businesspeople and the self-employed,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Maurício Puls, ''O Malufismo'', São Paulo, Publifolha, 2000, as abridged in Lawrence Boudon &amp; Katherine D. McCann, ''Handbook of Latin American Studies: Social Sciences'',59, Austin: University of Texas Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-292-70535-2}}, page 582&lt;/ref&gt; whose hallmark consisted "in the refusal to admit the social character of social problems", proposing instead a heavy-handed approach to them.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Renato Janine Ribeiro, ''O afeto autoritário: televisão, ética e democracia ''. Cotia: Ateliê Editorial, 2004, {{ISBN|85-7480-230-1}}, page 37. Available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=oUIoW_wfO3kC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=malufismo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LGrQS636EoS8lQeJtPDIDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=malufismo&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the philosopher [[Marilena Chaui]], writing in the mid-1980s, ''malufismo'' stood for the privatization of political power: "a fringe form of the [military] dictatorship as it turned from raw force into mob rule".&lt;ref&gt;Marilena Chaui, "Maluf ou o Novo Corpo do Rei", ''Lua Nova'', October–December 1984, available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=oV5h_Q7EtDkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=malufismo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NP3fS_PAOYKRuAfh7JHjBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=malufismo&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and money laundering indictments==

However, one of the consequences of Pitta's disastrous administration in São Paulo, was that it left the São Paulo municipality mired in debt, as such drawing attention to Maluf's and his former protégé's management practices: in the words of a Brazilian professor at the end of Pitta's term, "Sao Paulo's corruption has been transformed into a public horror from the whispered-about horror it always was". That called eventually for judicial scrutiny of Maluf's policies, especially his public works, his relentless extension of "the city's [São Paulo's] unmitigating concrete sprawl".&lt;ref&gt;Both quotes taken from Simon Romero, "Sao Paulo Creaks Under Debt Crisis", ''The New York Times'', April 15, 2000, [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/15/business/international-business-sao-paulo-creaks-under-debt-crisis.html?fta=y&amp;incamp=archive:article_related]&lt;/ref&gt; One notable example of the allegations of corruption that surfaced  around Maluf was the [[Ayrton Senna]] tunnel, which passes underneath [[Parque Ibirapuera|Ibirapuera Park]] and cost more, per kilometer, than the [[Channel Tunnel]] (it is alleged that the tunnel cost over US$400 million more than it should). Under dispute is Maluf's personal wealth, which critics attribute to his involvement in corruption scandals; supporters, conversely, point to a legitimate origin of such wealth in his family's companies – namely the mamoooth [[plywood]] trust [[Eucatex]].

Maluf was also part of an extensive investigation, by a Parliamentary Inquiry Committee set up in 2003, regarding [[money laundering]] involving bank accounts held by him and his family in [[Jersey]] (one of the [[Channel Islands]]). He has been convicted of corruption multiple times, but only in 2001 was the sentence final, with no possibility of appeal. At the time, he was forced to pay approximately R$500.000 to the state. Many of his alleged crimes cannot be prosecuted, due to the nature of the Brazilian [[statute of limitations]]. Even if he were to be convicted, there would be serious questions about whether he would serve jail time, as he is over 70 years of age.

In early September 2005, Paulo Maluf and his son [[Flávio Maluf]] were temporarily arrested by the Brazilian Federal police, under the charge of intimidating witnesses of an ongoing investigation. They were only incarcerated for a few weeks. So notorious is Maluf's reputation that in Brazil the verb ''malufar'' was created, meaning "to steal public money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The lives of those whom Brazil made rich|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21700363-lives-those-whom-brazil-made-rich-rich-upon-rich|accessdate=10 June 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This verb is also sometimes used outside Brazil, with one example being the French newspaper "Le Monde". [http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0,36-688092,0.html]

In the [[Brazilian general elections, 2006|2006 elections]], Maluf ran for a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Brazilian Chamber of Deputies]], being elected as the candidate for the federal legislature with a national record in terms of ballots cast personally for a candidate to the federal legislature in this particular election (739,837).&lt;ref&gt;The Brazilian proportional voting system for parliamentary elections admits ballots cast for a party as well as for a particular candidate to the legislature. Be it said that, although spectacular, Maluf's 2006 voting was roughly half of the greatest ever number of ballots received for a Brazilian congressional election, this record belonging so far to the 1,5 million votes received, in the preceding 2002 elections, by the late congressman - also for São Paulo - [[Enéas Carneiro]]. In relative terms, however, the greatest ever voting for a congressional candidacy still stands with the 269,000 ballots cast for [[Leonel Brizola]] by the defunct [[Guanabara State]]'s electorate in the 1962 election, which comprised a third of all valid ballots.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reelected again in 2010, with something around 497,000 ballots cast for him.&lt;ref&gt;"Ficha suja, Maluf tem 497 mil votos, mas não sabe se assumirá". UOL newssite, October 4, 2010, available at [http://eleicoes.uol.com.br/2010/sao-paulo/ultimas-noticias/2010/10/04/ficha-suja-maluf-tem-495-mil-votos-mas-nao-sabe-se-assumira-o-cargo.jhtm] Retrieved May 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His 2010 bid for reelection was fraught with legal doubts, as a recent federal statute (Complementary Law 135/2010, commonly known as ''Lei [[Ficha Limpa]]'' or "Clean Record Act") allowed electoral courts to refuse to register the candidacies of people already found guilty by a higher, collegiate court (possibility of further appeals notwithstanding);  however, as the Brazilian [[Supremo Tribunal Federal|STF]] decided in March 2011 that the "Clean Record Act" did not apply to the 2010 elections, according to the principle of anteriority (no offence being punished when defined by a non-previously existing law, and a Brazilian electoral law must be in force at least a year before the election is held),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=175082 Cf. STF newssite]&lt;/ref&gt; all charges against Maluf's registration and subsequent office-taking were eventually dropped. During the 2014 elections, Maluf stood again as a congressional candidate, but his candidacy was this time denied acceptance by a 4-to-3 decision of the [[Superior Electoral Court|TSE]].&lt;ref&gt;TSE site, [http://www.tse.jus.br/noticias-tse/2014/Setembro/tse-mantem-indeferimento-do-registro-de-candidatura-de-paulo-maluf]. Retrieved October 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Pending a recourse to the STF, Maluf was allowed to campaign and to receive ballots cast for him in October 5, 2014, but such votes are legally regarded as null until - and if - his candidacy is declared as lawful. Were this to happen, his 2014 voting would make him the eighth most voted candidate for the Federal Legislature in the State of São Paulo, with 246,446 ballots.&lt;ref&gt;"Barrado Pela Ficha Limpa, Paulo Maluf Tem Mais De 240 Mil Votos".

On March 9, 2007, [[Robert M. Morgenthau]] of the Manhattan's District Attorney's office issued an &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/world/americas/09indict.html?em&amp;ex=1173589200&amp;en=0097af41dc0be82b&amp;ei=5087%0A www.nytimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; indictment against Paulo Maluf for money laundering in relation to a kickback and inflated invoice scheme that allegedly stole $11.6m from a Brazilian road contract project totaling $140 million. From November 1997 to May 1999 the money passed through an account at the [[Safra National Bank of New York]] and was secretly controlled by Maluf. This indictment was maintained by a New York judge on April 25, 2012, who dismissed a petition from the Malufs, Paulo and Flávio, who sought a court order to toss out the indictment.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Freifeld (Reuters), "New York judge refuses to dismiss Brazilian kickback case".''Chicago Tribune'', April 25, 2012, available at [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-maluf-nychargesbre83o1is-20120425,0,6793939.story]. Retrieved April 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Also refused by the same judge was the Malufs' bid for having lifted their March 2010 inclusion in the [[Interpol notice|Red notice]] of [[Interpol]],&lt;ref&gt;Maluf's red notice is available on [http://www.interpol.int/Wanted-Persons/(wanted_id)/2009-13608]. Accessed July 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; which makes them subject to arrest and [[extradition]] in 181 countries. As this [[arrest warrant]] is not valid in Brazil because the [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution]] does not allow for the extradition of Brazilian citizens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/mat/2010/03/19/paulo-maluf-entra-para-lista-de-procurados-da-interpol-916123917.asp Inclusion in the Red Notice of Interpol (in Portuguese)]&lt;/ref&gt; its practical meaning is that the Malufs are to be arrested if they travel outside Brazil.

In addition, Maluf and his son Flávio were sentenced to three years in prison (along with a two-year sentence for his wife Sylvia) in France in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramirez|first1=Sughey|title=French Court Sentences Former Brazilian Mayor to Three Years in Prison|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2016/03/1745821-french-court-sentences-former-brazilian-mayor-to-three-years-in-prison.shtml|accessdate=18 March 2016|publisher=Folha de S.Paulo|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2017, after being convicted of corruption by the Supreme Court of Brazil and after a few attempts to challenge that conviction by means of internal appeals within the Supreme Court, Maluf surrendered to Brazilian police, to begin his prison sentence as ordered. On 30 March 2018 he was released from prison under house arrest on humanitarian grounds, due to his advanced age and poor health. He currently remains under house arrest and, as ordered by the Brazilian Supreme Court, in August 2018 the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil officially declared that, as a result of his conviction, Maluf lost his Federal Deputy seat.

Sgt '''Per Bergsland''' (17 January 1918 – 9 June 1992) was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[POW]] in the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[POW camp]] [[Stalag Luft III]] and one of only three men to escape to freedom in the "[[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|Great Escape]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/greatescape/three.html ''The Great Escape - The Three That Got Away''(Nova)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports career==
During in the 1930s Bergsland competed in [[orienteering]], representing the club [[IL Heming]]. In 1939 he placed second at the individual Norwegian championship in orienteering held at [[Modum]].&lt;ref name=o90&gt;{{cite book |title=Orienteringsidretten i Norge gjennom 90 år |editor1=Berglia, Knut |editor2=Brohaug, Tom-Erik |editor3=Staver, Kristoffer |editor4=Thuesen, Kaare |editor5=Strandhagen, Torgeir |pages=71–76 |year=1987 |language=Norwegian |publisher=[[Norges Orienteringsforbund]] |location=Oslo }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in Bærum, but resided at [[Ullern]]åsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dagens navn|work=Aftenposten|date=16 January 1988|page=20|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Per Bergsland served as an instructor at flight school in [[Canada]] before he transferred to the [[RAF Ferry Command]], where he was assigned to fly with a combat unit. As a member of [[No. 332 Squadron RAF]] (332 Sqn) stationed at [[North Weald]] airfield, Bergsland's [[Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Vb]], (serial no AB269, coded AH:D) was shot down by a German [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] during the [[Dieppe Raid]] on 19 August 1942. After arriving at the POW camp, he gave his name as "Peter Rockland" (''Per'' = [[Petrus (given name)|Petrus]], meaning rock in [[Greek language|Greek]], and ''Berg'' meaning mountain or rock in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), in order to protect his family in Norway from German reprisals.

[[File:Model Stalag Luft III.jpg|thumb|300px|''Stalag Luft III'' mockup.]]

In what later became known as the "Great Escape", he was escapee #43 among the 76 prisoners of war who managed to escape from the camp via tunnel with another Norwegian pilot, escapee #44 [[Jens Müller (pilot)|Jens Müller]],

|text="Bergsland was wearing a civilian suit he had made for himself from a Royal Marine uniform, with an RAF overcoat slightly altered with brown leather sewn over the buttons. A black RAF tie, no hat. He carried a small suitcase which had been sent from Norway. In it were Norwegian toothpaste and soap, sandwiches, and 163 reichsmarks given to him by the Escape Committee.

We caught the 2:04 train to [[Frankfurt an der Oder]]. Our papers stated that we were Norwegian electricians from the Arbeitslager [labor camp] in Frankfurt working in the vicinity of Sagan. For the journey from Frankfurt to [[Stettin]] we had other papers ordering us to change our place of work from Frankfurt to Stettin, and to report to the Birgermeister of Stettin."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/greatescape/three.html ''The Great Escape - The Three That Got Away''(Nova)]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Bergsland and Müller made it to the nearby town, where they caught a train to [[Szczecin|Stettin]] in Germany (now: [[Szczecin]], Poland). At the port, the pair were snuck onto a Swedish ship by friendly sailors and made it to the safety of [[Gothenburg]]. There, they met the British consulate, who arranged travel by train to [[Stockholm]], where they were flown to [[Scotland]] from [[Bromma]] airport. From there they were sent by train to [[London]] and shortly afterwards to '[[Little Norway]]' in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profero.no/littlenorway/Personell_Little_Norway_1940-1945.pdf ''List of personnel associated with Little Norway'' (Edvard Omholt-Jensen "The Spirit of Little Norway" Atheneum. 1986)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, only three POWs from Stalag Luft III made it to [[Neutral country|neutral countries]] and freedom. 

The third escapee was the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] [[Bram van der Stok]], who crossed most of occupied Europe and escaped to Spain with the help of the [[French resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/5648616/Bram-van-der-Stok.html|work=Daily Telegraph|title=Obituary - Bram van der Stok|date=1 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining 73 escapees were captured. [[Adolf Hitler]] wanted to [[Execution (legal)|execute]] them all, but [[Hermann Göring]] persuaded him not to: in the end, fifty were shot as an example. The remaining 23 were held in the custody of the [[Gestapo]] before being sent off to other camps. 17 were returned to [[Stalag Luft III]], four were sent to [[Sachsenhausen (detention camp)|Sachsenhausen]], and two to [[Oflag IV-C|Colditz Castle]].

==Postwar career==
In 1946, Per Bergsland began as a pilot in [[Fred Olsen Air Transport]]. He later became Chief Pilot and Operational Manager. Per Bergsland became CEO of [[Fred Olsen Air Transport]] in 1968 and CEO of [[Widerøe]] from 1970 to 1981.

{{Business administration}}

A '''supervisory board''' or '''supervisory committee''', often called ''[[board of directors]]'', is a group of individuals chosen by the [[stockholder]]s of a [[corporation|company]] to promote their interests through the governance of the company and to hire and supervise the executive directors and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]].

[[Corporate governance]] varies between countries, especially regarding the board system. There are countries that have a one-tier board system (like the U.S.) and there are others that have a [[Board of directors#Two-tier system|two-tier board system]] like Germany.

In a one-tier board, all the directors (both [[executive director]]s as well as [[non-executive director]]s) form one board, called the board of directors.

In a two-tier board there is an executive board (all executive directors) and a separate supervisory board (all non-executive directors).

== Germany ==
German corporation law, the ''Aktiengesetz'', requires all public companies (''[[Aktiengesellschaft]]en'') to have two boards:
a management board called a ''[[Vorstand]]'' and a supervisory board called an ''Aufsichtsrat''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In Germany the supervisory board of large corporations is composed of 20 members, 10 of whom are elected by the shareholders, the other 10 being employee representatives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The supervisory board oversees and appoints the members of the management board and must approve major business decisions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

When a German company has between 500-2,000 employees, the minimum of members a board can consist of is three, and the maximum is 21.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The number of members has to be divisible by three, as stated in the law. In such companies, the workers select one-third of the supervisory board.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

When it comes to internal elections the chairman of supervisory board, the ''Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender'', has two votes in case of a draw.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The supervisory board, in theory, is intended to provide a [[Monitoring and Evaluation|monitoring]] role. However, the appointment of supervisory board members has not been a transparent process and has therefore led to inefficient monitoring and poor corporate governance in some cases (Monks and Minow, 2001).
The discussion about whether a one-tier or a two-tier board system leads to better corporate governance is ongoing in Germany and many other countries. Improvements in corporate governance are often the result of shareholders (such as active private investors or activist investment funds) holding boards (whether one- or two-tier) of companies in which they invest to account.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== China ==
Another example of a two-tier board system: Mainland China

In China's corporation law, the so-called (中华人民共和国公司法), it stipulates a limited liability company (有限责任公司) to have: a board of directors (董事会) and a board of supervisors (监事会).
Regarding the Chinese requirements of a board of supervisors, under Articles 52 to 57 of the Company Law of the People's Republic of China:

*a limited liability company requires to set up a board of supervisors, which shall comprise at least 3 persons. A limited liability company, which has relatively less shareholders or is relatively small in scale, may have 1 or 2 supervisors, and does not have to establish a board of supervisors. The board of supervisors shall include representatives of shareholders and representatives of the employees of the company at an appropriate ratio which shall be specifically stimulated in the Articles of Association. The employees' representatives, who are to serve as members of the board of supervisors, shall be democratically elected by the employees of the company through the meeting of the employees' representatives or employees' meeting, or by any other means. The board of supervisors shall have one chairman, who shall be elected by half or more of all the supervisors. The chairman of the board of supervisors shall convene and preside over the meetings of the board of supervisors. If the chairman of the board of supervisors is unable to or does not perform his duties, the supervisor recommended by half or more of the supervisors shall convene and preside over the meetings of the board of supervisors. No director or senior manager may concurrently work as a supervisor.
*Every term of office of the supervisors shall be 3 years. The supervisors may, after the expiry of their term of office, hold a consecutive term upon re-election. If no reelection is timely carried out after the expiry of the term of office of the supervisors, or the number of the members of the board of supervisors is less than the quorum due to the resignation of some directors from the board of supervisors prior to the expiry of their term of office, the original supervisors shall, before the newly elected supervisors assume their posts, exercise the authorities of the supervisors according to laws, administrative regulations as well as the articles of association.
*The board of supervisors or supervisor of a company with no board of supervisors may exercise the following authorities: (1) checking the financial affairs of the company; (2) supervising the duty-related acts of the directors and senior managers, and bringing forward proposals on the removal of any director or senior manager who violates any law, administrative regulation, the articles of association or any resolution of the shareholders' meeting; (3) demanding any director or senior manager to make corrections if his act has injured the interests of the company; (4) proposing to convening temporary shareholders' meetings, and convening and presiding over shareholders' meetings when the board of directors does not exercise the functions of convening and presiding over the shareholders' meetings as prescribed in this Law; (5) bringing forward proposals at shareholders' meetings; (6) initiating actions against directors or senior managers according to other relevant Article of this Law; and (7) other duties as prescribed by the Articles of Association.
*The supervisors may attend the meetings of the board of directors as non-voting delegates, and may raise questions or suggestions on the matters to be decided by the board of directors. If the board of supervisors or supervisor of the company with no board of directors finds that the company is running abnormally, it (he) may make investigations. Where necessary, it (he) may hire an accounting firm to help it (him), with the relevant expenses being borne by the company.
*The board of supervisors shall hold meetings at least once a year. The supervisors may propose to hold temporary meetings of the board of supervisors. The discussion methods and voting procedures of the board of supervisors shall be prescribed in the articles of association, unless it is otherwise stimulated in this Law. The resolution of the board of supervisors shall be adopted by half or more of the supervisors. The board of supervisors shall make records for the resolutions on the matter it discusses, which shall be signed by the supervisors in presence.
*The expenses necessary for the board of supervisors or the supervisor of a company with no board of supervisors to perform its (his) duties shall be borne by the company.

'''Town &amp; Country Surf Designs''' (also known as T&amp;C Surf) is a world recognized manufacturer of [[surfboard]]s. T&amp;C's origins began in 1971 with a single store founded by [[Craig Sugihara]] in [[Pearl City, Hawaii]]. The company soon expanded into a full line of [[surfwear]] and [[surfing]] accessories and now has retail shops throughout the world in countries such as [[Japan]], [[Australia]], and [[Peru]].

In 1976, [[Tak Kawahara]] became the co-owner of Town &amp; Country (T&amp;C) Surfboard’s wholesale division and developed the apparel brand, which became one of the top five in the beach and active surfwear industry.  During his tenure at T&amp;C he expanded the brand’s product line by introducing surf watches, beach sandals and school stationery accessories, all of which were the first of its kind in the surfing industry. T&amp;C was also the first surf label to take production off shore. Tak continues to consult with many surf companies on product design, production processes, marketing, sales and operations. 

In the 1980s, T&amp;C became famous for their shirt designs featuring "Da' Boys," surfing cartoon characters designed by [[Steve Nazar]]. The most famous of these was Thrilla Gorilla, a surfing anthropomorphic gorilla. 
In 1988, [[LJN]] released a game on the [[NES]] based on the store, entitled ''[[Town &amp; Country Surf Designs: Wood &amp; Water Rage]]''. A sequel focusing on Thrilla Gorilla (''[[Town &amp; Country II: Thrilla's Surfari]]'') followed in 1992, before the character designs disappeared until re-launching as part of the [http://www.thrillakrewgear.com/ Thrilla Krew] brand in 2016.
