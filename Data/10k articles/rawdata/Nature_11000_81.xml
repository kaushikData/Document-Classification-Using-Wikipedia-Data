      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38447">The '''Archaeological Park of Dion''' is the most important archaeological site at [[Mount Olympus]] in Greece, located in [[Dion, Pieria|Dion]] (Greek: Δίον). In the area comprised by the Archaeological Park of Dion, sanctuaries were found from the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Greece|Roman]] periods. The park displays the importance of ancient Dion in the [[History of Pieria (regional unit)|history of Pieria]].
[[File:Dion, Mosaik Thermen.jpg|thumb|400px|Mosaic at the thermal baths]]

== Location ==
Dion is located at the north-east foot of [[Mount Olympus]]. It is five kilometers from the sea, 15 kilometers from [[Katerini]] and 17 kilometers from the ancient [[Leivithra]]. In Hellenistic times the distance to the sea was only 1.5 kilometers. Dion is connected with the Thermaean Gulf by the once navigable river Baphyras.

== Archaeological facilities ==

=== The Archaeological Park ===
[[File:Archäothiki.jpg|thumb|The Archaeotheke]]
The park has an area of 150 hectares, of which nearly 50 hectares belong to the urban area and 50 hectares to the sanctuaries. The other area has not yet been explored archaeologically. In the former urban area residential buildings, a market square, public buildings, churches, bathhouses, shops, workshops and toilets have been found. The sanctuaries, the theaters and the cemetery are located outside the city

=== The Archaeological Museum ===
Half an kilometer west of the archaeological park, in the modern village of Dion, is the [[Archaeological Museum of Dion|archaeological museum]], built in 1983. Here the finds of ancient Dion and other archaeological places are exhibited. On the first floor there are also exhibits from [[Pydna]] and other archaeological sites of [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]]. In a small cinema, visitors will be audiovisual informed about Dion.

=== The Archaeotheke ===
The building was erected directly behind the museum on the western side, specifically for the exhibition of the Dionysos mosaic. On the upper floor, a gallery is arranged around the mosaic so that the visitor can view it from all perspectives. In showcases recently found exhibits are displayed.

== History ==
424 v. [[Thucydides]] mentions Dion as the first city reached by the Spartan general Brasidas, coming from Thessaly (Tempi) in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Thukydides. ''The peloponesian war''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentioned Dion as one of the places at Orpheus had lived.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 9.30.4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Hellenistic period, Dion became the religious center of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. [[Zeus]] was venerated here, and Olympic games were held in honor of Zeus and the Muses. The village of Dion gained a certain importance within Greece through the sanctuary and over time developed into a city. [[Alexander the Great]] sacrificed to Zeus in Dion before he began his campaign against the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Hellenic Republic, Ministry of culture and sports, Onassis Foundation USA: ''Gods and Mortals at Olympus.'' Edited by Dimitrios Pandermalis, page 67and 68, {{ISBN|978-0-9906142-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he had 25 bronze statues of the cavaliers fallen in the Battle of the Cranicos, erected in the Zeus Olympios Shrine. In the year 219 BC, the city was destroyed by the Aitolians. Philipp V had the city rebuilt immediately. The Romans took the city 169 BC. Gradually, Roman settlers came to Dion and brought their officialdom, their units of measurement and weight units with them. In the course of the changing owners, more sanctuaries were built. After the middle of the 3rd century AD, the decline started by the raids of neighboring tribes, earthquakes and floods. In the fourth century AD, Dion (Dium) experienced a last flourishing when it became the official seat of a bishop. The place is last mentioned as an administrative district of the Byzantine emperor Constantinos Porphyrogennetos in the 10th century.

=== Recent History ===
[[File:Hellenistisches Theater.jpg|thumb|The Hellenistic theatre]]
At the end of the 18th century, the French consul Felix de Beaujour visited ancient Dion without knowing the ancient site that was abandoned and covered with the remains of buildings and columns.

In December 1806 the ancient Dion was rediscovered by the English explorer [[William M. Leake]]. He identified the ruins of ancient Dion near the village of Melathria, a small village inhabited by farmers and cattle breeders (Melathria was later renamed Dion).&lt;ref&gt;William Martin Leake: Travels in Northern Greece. Band 3, J. Rodwell, London 1835, pages 408–413.&lt;/ref&gt; He recognized under the vegetation the ancient Hellenistic theater, the stadium and parts of the city wall. The French archaeologist Léon Heuzey confirmed the discovery in 1855. He mapped parts of the city wall, found the foundations of some towers and noted the inscriptions of some tombstones.&lt;ref&gt;L. Heuzey et H. Daumet, Mission Archeologique de Macedoine (1876)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1912, the year of the liberation of Macedonia by the Ottomans, the ancient Dion was given more attention. The archaeologist G. P. Oikonomos collected and published all the inscriptions he found in the vicinity of Dion.

The Rector of the University of Thessaloniki and Professor of Archeology, Georgios Sotiriadis, began with the first excavations. They began in June 1928 with the aim of finding the sanctuary of Zeus Olympios. He found and examined several of the tumuli within the city walls. Also, a basilica from early Christian times was discovered. The assumption that a temple was under the basilica proved to be deceptive after which one had dug five meters deep. The most important find of this first period of excavation was a Macedonian vault from the 4th century BC, Which had already been plundered by grave-robbers in ancient times. The excavations were discontinued in 1931.

Charalambos Makaronas found a second Macedonian grave in 1955. A third grave was discovered a year later.

From 1961 Georgios Bakalakis resumed the works. In 1962, a large part of the city walls and the defensive towers were discovered during the mapping of the previously known excavation site. During the excavation phase under G. Bakalakis, the Roman theater was located, which extends southeast of the Hellenistic theater. The excavations at the early Christian basilica were completed by Stylianos Pelekanidis.

From the summer of 1973, the work was continued under the direction of Professor [[Dimitrios Pandermalis]] ([[University of Thessaloniki]]). His first goal was to explore the remains of two buildings south of the city area. The excavations revealed the Demeter sanctuary. In the same year, finds of statues of Asklepios, Hygeia and Telesphoros showed that also the Asklepios cult was practiced in Dion. On the main street the armor and the shields were released. The orchestras of the Hellenistic theater were then freed from the overlying layer of the earth. The theater dates from the 5th century BC; the Bacchae of [[Euripides]] were premiered here.

In the summer of 1976 excavations were carried out in the southeastern sector within the city wall. One came upon the great thermae. These were obviously destroyed by an earthquake. The mosaic of a bull in the [[frigidarium]] was separated into two parts, the lower part of which is 50&amp;nbsp;cm lower than the upper one. On the northern side of the baths were statues of the children of Asklepios.

Under difficult conditions the excavation work on the Isis Shrine took place. Spring water and mud caused the trenches to collapse frequently. A dam was built to continue the work. Again, there were signs of destruction by an earthquake with subsequent flooding. The excavations were completed in 1984.

The stadium was excavated in 1995 under the leadership of Giorgos Karadedos. Beside the playing field, several rows of seats were found.

In June 1987 the Dionysosmosaic was cleared and then protected by a roof construction against weather influences.

The sanctuary of Zeus Olympios was finally discovered in 2000 when investigations were made on the site near the Roman theater.

After a flooding of the Isis Shrine of Archaeological Park in 2002, was decided to move the river Vaphyras a few yards westward, so that future floods can no longer harm the sanctuary. In the course of this, artifacts were found which ultimately led to the excavation of the sanctuary of Zeus Hypsistos, the Almighty God. As the work approached its end, the cult statue of Zeus Hypsistos was found in the mud.

Beginning in 2007, under the leadership of Semeli Pingiatoglou, excavations were carried out with the aim of finding the oldest structures of ancient Dion.

The Dionysus mosaic was removed from its original place of discovery in 2015 and transferred to a specially built building (Archaeotheke).&lt;ref&gt;Hellenic Republic, Ministry of culture and sports, Onassis Foundation USA: ''Gods and Mortals at Olympus.'' Edited by Dimitrios Pandermalis, Ancient Dion: A chronicle of the excavations, pages 19-29, {{ISBN|978-0-9906142-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works are still continuing under the direction of the [[University of Thessaloniki]].

== The Sanctuaries ==
[[File:Dion Baphyras.jpg|thumb|The river Vaphyras]]

=== Vaphyras ===
Although no special sanctuary was erected to him, the river Vaphyras was considered a divinity. About 100 m east of the park entrance is its source. The holy grove of the Muses probably grew here. The head of a statue representing the personalized river was found in the spring area. According to Hesiod, the Vaphyras originates from the cosmic river Okeanos, dominated by the primeval goddess Tethys.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, Theogony 337-70&lt;/ref&gt;

An Artemis shrine discovered near the river is considered to be dedicated to the goddess Artemis Vaphyria. She watched the transition of young girls to the stage of marriageable women.

The river Vaphyras is interwoven in Greek mythology with Orpheus and the Muses. In the second century AD, Pausanias writes that the upper part of the Vaphyras bore the name of Helikon.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 9.30.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Two-thirds of its length ran underground, before returning to Dion. According to Pausanias, however, this was not always the case. The inhabitants of Dion claimed that the Helikon flowed past Dion. But when the women who killed Orpheus wanted to wash the blood from their hands in the Helikon, the river dried up, for he did not wish to have any part in this act. Only in Dion did he appear again on the surface.

=== Demeter Sanctuary ===
[[File:Dion, Demeter Heiligtum.jpg|thumb|Sanctuary of Demeter]]
[[File:Nonae Capratinae.jpg|thumb|Arura, Maid of Plutiades, dedicates this to Zeus Hypsistos with the help of Fructus, after serving as Agoranomos during the Nonae Capratinae]]
It consists of several temples and is dated from the archaic period up to the Roman period. The sanctuary of Asklepios is located in the immediate vicinity. The connection between the two sanctuaries is also evident at other archaeological sites in Greece.

In the open, walled-in area, the goddess was offered liquid sacrifices. The oldest remains of the sanctuary are also found here. End of the 4th century BC two archaic temples were replaced by two Doric temples. Small, one-room temples (Oikos) were consecrated to the gods of the earth like [[Baubo]] and Kurotrophos. They were hoped for rich harvest yields. Another temple was erected in honor of Aphrodite. The faithful hoped for increased fertility. In front of the temples there were altars on which carnal sacrifices were offered to the respective gods. Vegetable sacrifices, such as grain or fruit, were spread out on so-called cult tables. Archaeological finds and ancient records have given the water an important role in the Demeter cult. It was among the duties of the priestesses to ensure that pure water was always available. In addition to cleaning rituals, water was seen as the necessary element to allow plant growth. Two circular wells are among the oldest structures of the temple.

In addition to the usual finds such as statues, pottery, jewelery, oil lamps etc., one found a ring stone from Mycenaean time. It dates from the 14th to 15th century BC, and shows a schematically represented lion in front of a tree. The artifact is a reference to the earlier settlement of Dion.&lt;ref&gt;Hellenic Republic, Ministry of culture and sports, Onassis Foundation USA: ''Gods and Mortals at Olympus.'' Edited by Dimitrios Pandermalis, page 102, {{ISBN|978-0-9906142-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1990 the foundations of an altar were discovered east of the temple; At this point 1973 the head of a statue of the goddess was recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Greek ministry of culture and sport, Aristotle University Thessaloniki, ''Το Αρχαιολογικό Έργο στή Μακεδονία και Θράκη (The archaeological work of Macedonia and Thrace)'' Volume 4, 1990, page 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Late antiquity there were kilns on the grounds of the Demeter Shrine.

=== Asclepios Sanctuary ===
In the fourth century BC, The [[Asclepion]] was built. A place was chosen with plenty of water, because it played a special role in the practice of the Asclepion cult. It served the healing of the sick and was needed for the cult practices. So far, the foundations of a building that consisted of two rooms were cleared. The discovery of a toilet near the sanctuary suggests that people (pilgrims) were there for some time to cure their ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientdion.org|title=Ancient Dion, Asclepios sanctuary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zeus Hypsistos sanctuary ===
A sacred road led to the sanctuary of Zeus Hypsistos (Greek Ζευς ὕψιστος "Zeus the highest god"). It was lined with small columns with marble eagles sitting there. These are devotions for the "Most Holy". The road led to a large square, on which stood a temple. It consisted of several rooms. In the northernmost room, the temple of Zeus, a statue of Zeus Hypsistos and the figure of a marble eagle were found. The floor was decorated with mosaic, which retained the image of two ravens. Also the floor of the overall building was mosaic. There remained a white bull and double axes. On the western side is a water basin. In front of the temple stands an altar, to the base of which a metal ring was attached, which served to tie the sacrificial animals.
Both gods, Zeus Hypsistos and Zeus Olympios, were simultaneously venerated. While Zeus Olympios ruled the people from the top of Mount Olympus, Zeus Hypsistos dominated the sky, that is, all the supernatural.

==== Nonae Capratinae ====
Following the conquest of Dion by the Romans, the Nonae Capratinae was held on 7 July of the year. Female slaves enjoyed certain freedoms at this festival; one of them received the rights of Agoranomos that day. The Agoranomos (composed of the Greek words agora, market, and nomos, law) supervised the trading on the marketplace, set prices and had other tasks. From the inscription of an eagle statuette found in the sanctuary of Zeus Hypsistus in September 2003, it appears that Arura, the servant (probably a slave) of Plutiades, was elected Agoranomos. This statuette is the first proof that the Nonae Capratinae was also celebrated in the Roman provinces, outside of Italy. The connection between the worship of Zeus Hypsistos and the Nonae Capratinae was probably in honor of Jupiter Capitolinus, the Jupiter Optimus Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/30401241/The_Nonae_Capratinae_in_Dion_and_Religious_Associations_and_Public_Festivals_in_Roman_Macedonia_GRBS_56_2016_663-678|title=The Nonae Capratinae in Dion and Religious Associations and Public Festivals in Roman Macedonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zeus Olympios Sanctuary ===
[[File:Zeus Hephaistos.jpg|thumb|Zeus Hypsistos]]
In the Hellenistic period a powerful temple was built on a sacred grove consecrated to Zeus. In this sanctuary were gilded statues of the Macedonian kings. The bronze statues of his cavaliers who had fallen in the Battle of the Cranikos were also errected in the Zeus Olympios shrine. The central square within the building was occupied by a 22 m long altar. The sacrificial animals were tied to metal rings. In the sacrificial ceremonies, the most important part of the Zeus cult, 100 cattle were sacrificed.

When the Aitolean league attacked Dion, the sanctuary was destroyed. But it was rebuilt immediately by the materials of the surrounding buildings by the Macedonian King Philip V.

==== The Zeus Cult in Dion ====
At the time of the reign of the Macedonian kings, the sanctuary of Zeus Olympios was the most important sanctuary of the city and the religious center of Macedonia. It has not yet been clarified whether the shrine was given its importance by the Olympic Games initiated by King Archelaus, or whether, inspired by [[Homer|Homer's]] Iliad, it had already played a central role for the region. [[Deucalion]] claimed that in Dion, after the sanctuary of Zeus Lykaios, the second oldest altar devoted to Zeus was erected. From the late 8th century BC, Zeus was worshiped at various places in Greece. It was common to all these Zeus sanctuaries that they took place on the summit of a mountain, or near a summit. Inscriptions, pottery and remains of charcoal from the Hellenistic and Roman period on the summit of Agios Antonios (2817 m) near Dion, testify that the cult of Zeus was practiced not only in Dion, as also on Mount Olympus. The Macedonian kings used the temple to archive their royal decrees. Some of them are exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Dion.&lt;ref&gt;Hellenic Republic, Ministry of culture and sports, Onassis Foundation USA: ''Gods and Mortals at Olympus.'' Edited by Dimitrios Pandermalis, Fritz Graf, Ohio State University, {{ISBN|978-0-9906142-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isis Sanctuary ===
[[File:Isis Heiligtum.jpg|thumb|The Isis Sanctuary]]
The most recent of the sanctuaries in Dion is the sanctuary of [[Isis]]. It was erected in the second century AD on the site of a former fertility sanctuary. The plant has a considerable size and is traversed by a channel, which is to symbolize the river Nile. The main entrance is in the east, i.e. the side facing the sea. A minor entrance is found on the north side of the sanctuary. The temple and altar of Isis Lochia (Isis as the guardian of the child's bed) are framed in the western part of the complex by two smaller temples of Isis Tyche and the Aphrodite Hypolympiada. In these little temples, springs are still active. In the cult of Isis, water was given sacred meaning. Two rooms, which are located in the north of the temple complex, served as a sanctuary for hypnotherapy, while figures of the patrons of the sanctuary were placed in the other room.

== The Macedonian Tombs ==

In the course of the first excavations, a vaulted Macedonian grave with a Doric façade from the 4th century BC was found. The marble doors were broken, the grave was robbed by grave robbers. A funerary couch of marble with the representation of a battle of cavalry and parts of a frieze, displaying lions, remained.

A second grave was excavated in 1955. It contained a stone couch, the floor was designed with colored pebbles.

One year later, a third grave was released. Next to a stone couch, there were three pedestals.

The fourth grave was discovered in 1979. A funerary couch with ivory inserts hid behind the marble gates.

The last grave was found in 1988. Among the finds was a silver quarter-drachmae with depicting Alexander the Great and a golden Charon's penny (Charons Obolus), in which the name "Epigenis" was engraved.

As burial objects gold jewelery, golden and silver coins, glass bottles that may have contained perfumes, glass jars, and a copper mirror had been found. Some tombstones, as well as the burial objects, are displayed in the [[Archaeological Museum of Dion|Archaeological Museum]].

== The Theatres ==

=== Hellinistic Theatre ===
{{Main article|Hellenistic theatre of Dion}}
[[File:Römisches Theater.jpg|thumb|The Roman Theatre]]
The classical theater, in which the premiere of Bakchen of [[Euripides]] took place, was replaced in the 3rd century BC by the Hellenistic theater. A semi-circular mound of earth was laid on which brick-built seats were placed. A digging around the round orchestra ensures the drainage of the rainwater. Underground rooms and hallways allowed the appearance and disappearance of actors and objects. The stage was slightly higher than the orchestra. There were devices which allowed to show special effects. The theater is used today, after a further modernization, for the annual "[[Olympus Festival|Olympus Festival]]".

=== Roman Theatre ===
The Roman theater was built in the 2nd century AD. It had 24 rows of seats arranged in a semicircle. Below the row of seats were 14 brick vaults. The orchestra had a diameter of about 21 meters. The building was built of bricks, field stones and mortar. The stage and the koilon (the auditorium, the seats) were separated; The stage was decorated with marble elements. Among the exhibits excavated there was a statue of [[Hermes]].

== The Ancient City ==

=== The City Walls ===
[[File:Reste der Stadtmauer.jpg|thumb|Remains of the City wall]]

Since Dion was one of the few ancient Greek cities that lay in a single plane without any elevation, the city wall was particularly important in defense against attackers. In the east, the Vaphyras' marsh formed some protection, but there was neither a natural elevation nor an acropolis.

The city wall was built from the limestone of Mount Olympus between 306 and 304 BC, under the rule of the Macedonian king Kassander. It was 2625 meters long, three meters thick and seven to ten meters high. The western side is 642 m long, the southern and northern sections each 682 m long. The eastern part of the fortification has not yet been completely excavated. At a distance of 33 meters (100 Doric feet, 32.8&amp;nbsp;cm) stood towers with a floor area of seven by seven meters. In the southern and northern wall sections were two city gates, in the western part one city gate was found.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosia Stefanidou-Tiveriou. Hefte des archäologischen Seminars der Universität Bern, 17/2000, pages 50 bis 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the river Vaphyras, to the east of the town, there was probably a port facility. After the attack of the Aitolians (219 BC), in which the city wall was partly destroyed, the protective barrier was repaired immediately. He was given little attention during Roman domination. Sometimes even the masonry fell apart. When the attacks on Dion were piling up in the 3rd century AD, the city wall was repaired. Old sculptures and remains of other buildings were used as building materials. Floods by the Helikon and Vaphyras rivers during the early Christian era considerably reduced the urban area of Dion. The city wall had then only a length of 1600 meters. New walls were built on the north and east sides of the town. Column remains, sculptures and altars were used as building materials. In the 5th century AD the city wall was destroyed, probably by an earthquake. It was not rebuilt afterwards; This lack of protection may have been a reason why the population gradually left the village.&lt;ref&gt;Greek ministry of culture and sport, Aristotle University Thessaloniki, ''Το Αρχαιολογικό Έργο στή Μακεδονία και Θράκη (The archaeological work of Macedonia and Thrace)'' Volume 4, 1990, page 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Houses ===

In the course of the excavations, private houses were brought to light in various parts of the complex. Almost all have mosaic flooring. The names of the former owners occasionally come from preserved parts of a mosaic, or from stamping the lead pipes, which served the water supply. In addition to mosaics, statues, columns, remains of furniture, busts and others were found.

==== The Villa of Dionysus ====

The most important private building in the city is the Villa of Dionysus. In 1982, archaeologists started exploring the area east of the main road. They found a long-stretched building in the south-western part of which were shops and a bathing establishment. The bathroom could not only be entered from the street but had a separate entrance from the neighboring house. Further excavations brought to light statues of Dionysus, a Nike, and parts of other statues and statuettes. In June 1987 a large mosaic was found in the spacious atrium, which later became named [[Dionysus mosaic, Dion|Dionysusmosaic]]. Obviously, the atrium served as the dining room of the property. Among other finds in this room were a sculpture of four seated philosophers, the statuette of a satyr and a statuette of Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientdion.org|title=Ancient Dion, 'Dionysus villa'}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1989, four more rooms of the villa were exposed. While two of them had less interesting finds, the third room found four clay storage vessels. In the last room there was a damaged mosaic that represents in its midst the head of a Medusa. There was also a statue of Heracles with a club, bow, arrows, lion's skin and a statue of a deer. Two years earlier, the work in the atrium already found the head of the deer and the hand of Heracles holding the bow.&lt;ref&gt;Greek ministry of culture and sport, Aristotle University Thessaloniki, ''Το Αρχαιολογικό Έργο στή Μακεδονία και Θράκη (The archaeological work of Macedonia and Thrace) Volume 3'', 1989, page 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Works in the year 1990 brought parts of a statue to light which is a copy of the "Eros with a Bow" of the sculptor Lysippus.&lt;ref&gt;Greek ministry of culture and sport, Aristotle University Thessaloniki, ''Το Αρχαιολογικό Έργο στή Μακεδονία και Θράκη (The archaeological work of Macedonia and Thrace) Volume 4'', 1990, page 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Thermal Baths ===
[[File:Die großen Thermen.jpg|thumb|The Thermal Baths]]
All the [[thermal baths]] have the same structure as they have a pool with cold water basins and other basins with differently tempered water. Also the type of heating, by a hypocaust-system lying under the floor, is the same for all mentioned thermal baths.

The great thermal baths were built in the 2nd century AD. A hall covered with a mosaic floor leads to the bathing cabins and the water basins. There were rooms where Asclepios was worshiped. Since the thermal baths also served as a place for social gatherings, an [[Odeon of Athens|Odeon]] was built for social events such as readings, plays, or musical performances in the complex. The shops and toilets were still part of the thermal baths.

The so-called "thermal baths of the main street" are located east of the main street, opposite the wall with the stone armors and shields. The equipment was comparable to the large thermal baths, the area was only a lot smaller.

The thermal baths on the market can be found at the north-east end of the Roman market. Mosaic flooring and a reception hall decorated with paintings are the special features of these baths.

=== The Odeon ===
[[File:Das Odeon.jpg|thumb|The Odeon after restoration]]

==== History and Construction ====

Built in the 2nd century AD, the Odeon is part of the large thermal baths. The outer mass is 28.46 m by 19.46 m, it offered 400 seats arranged in the form of an amphitheatre around the semicircular orchestra. The excavations of the Odeon began in September 1977 and lasted for two years. The elements of an ancient theater with orchestra, koilon, four interior staircases, stage and two L-shaped staircases were found. The carefully executed stonework work combines Roman architecture with local craftsmanship. The 1.55 m thick outer wall was a major static element; She caught the side pressure of the Koilon and supported the roof. The walls of the building were built of limestone or burnt bricks. The excavations revealed how the building was destroyed. The great cracks in the walls, as well as the lowering of the ground and some walls, indicate a strong earthquake with subsequent fire. In 1990, excavations were once again carried out to measure the entire ground plan of the Odeon for the planned restoration; Shards from the classic period were found.&lt;ref&gt;Greek ministry of culture and sport, Aristotle University Thessaloniki, ''Το Αρχαιολογικό Έργο στή Μακεδονία και Θράκη (The archaeological work of Macedonia and Thrace)'' Volume 4, 1990, page 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restoration ====

The natural stresses where the remains of the Odeon were exposed to, heat, frost and moisture, destroyed parts of the building material (mortar, wood) over the centuries. The binding effect of the mortar subsided and the remaining foundation walls fell apart. The top part of the construction suffered the most, large blocks of the building dissolved and fell. The aim of the restoration was the preservation and reinforcement of the remains of the Odeon. The old mortar was sealed and cracks in the masonry were closed with fresh mortar. The fallen parts of the masonry were moved to their original place and fixed. The final work consisted of building a straight bearing surface from surrounding stones and covering them with specially made bricks. The material of the bricks corresponds to that of the ancient bricks. In the University of Thessaloniki the ancient bricks were examined and their composition determined. The composition of the mortar was determined according to laboratory tests and established in collaboration with the Management Committee for the Conservation of Ancient and Modern Monuments of the Ministry of Culture and Sport. The original construction was covered with lead before restoration. Thus, the old building fabric is severely separated from the new building materials. The floor of the Odeon was covered with pebbles and the architectural elements found on the site, such as columns, were erected in their original place.&lt;ref&gt;Directorate General for Antiquities and Cultural Heritage: The Odeum of the great Thermae of Dion, Greek ministry for culture and sport, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The financing for the protection, conservation and restoration of the Odeon was taken from the EU program "Macedonia-Thrace 2007-2013". The works were based on the studies of Professor G. Karadedos, University of Thessaloniki.

=== The Water Supply ===
[[File:Brunneneinfassung isis Heiligtum.jpg|thumb|Part of a well, Isis sanctuary Dion]]
The ancient Dion got its water from the Helikon River, 5 kilometres away. From there, water pipes were moved to Dion.

Partly they were underground, some were built as an aqueduct. Parts of the aqueduct were found in a ravine northwest of the city. Within the city, the water gathered in a large cistern, from which the distribution was carried out in underground pipes to other cisterns or wells. Clay and lead were used as material for the water pipes. The central cistern was built in the 2nd century AD of stone and clay bricks. Two wells, which took care of households and baths, were located in the northeast and southeast of the city area. A third well was, after the destruction of the main cistern by an earthquake, replaced by a smaller cistern.&lt;ref&gt;Greek ministry of culture and sport, Aristotle University Thessaloniki, ''Το Αρχαιολογικό Έργο στή Μακεδονία και Θράκη (The archaeological work of Macedonia and Thrace)'' Volume 4, 1990, page 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the organized water supply separate wells existed. So far, seven of them have been located and excavated. They are divided into three different types:
* Wells which were built with rough stones and later plastered.
* Wells with wedge-shaped bricks.
* Well whose shaft was lined with clay tubes.&lt;ref&gt;Greek ministry of culture and sport, Aristotle University Thessaloniki, ''Το Αρχαιολογικό Έργο στή Μακεδονία και Θράκη (The archaeological work of Macedonia and Thrace)'' Volume 2, 1989, page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Roman Market ===
[[File:Panzerungen und Schilde.jpg|thumb|Armour and Shields]]

It is an open space surrounded by shops and halls. On the side facing the mountains, in the middle of the building surrounding the market, there was a temple ([[Sebasteion]]) presumably consecrated to the Roman emperors. The floor is slightly above the level of the market square and is decorated with mosaic. Inside, there were remains of murals and fragments of male statues. To the east of the square, opposite the temple, stood a Roman basilica. It was decorated with the frieze of armor and shields, which is now to the west of the main road. Under the supervision of the local authority, banking operations were conducted and commercial contracts were concluded in the basilica.

=== The Praetorium ===
Near the Villa of Dionysus, on the main road, is the [[Praetorium]] located. The building was used as a hostel for officials and emissaries as well as to accommodate ordinary travelers ([[Taberna]]). A locally found Latin inscription designates the building as Praetorium with two Tabernae. The entrance was on the south side; in the eastern part of the complex were five bedrooms and a luxurious dining room, the [[Triclinium]]. The Tabernae consisted of two larger rooms in the western wing. Here the archaeologists found earthen storage vessels and some lamps. Between Praetorium and the Tabernae was probably a stable. Public toilets were accessible to both, the guests and the city's population. A source served the hygiene, underground channels derived the dirty water.

=== The Polygonal Building ===
At the intersection of the main street and the west gate leading street is the [[polygonal]] building. It covers about 1400 m² and probably served as a market hall. The complex is square and was built around a dodecagonal square. The square was surrounded by an arcade connecting the rooms of the building. The access was on the south side. A floor mosaic shows two wrestling athletes and two slaves with rucksacks.

===Churches===

==== The Episcopal Basilica ====

At its last heyday, when the church appointed Dion to be the seat of a bishop, the basilica of the bishop was built in two phases of construction in the 4th and 5th centuries. It was a three-nave church with [[narthex]]. The remains of the walls are painted, the floor was mosaic. A smaller building, situated to the west of the church, served as a [[baptistery]]. An earthquake at the end of the fourth century destroyed the building. On its foundations a church was erected, in which the baptistery was integrated. The baptismal font had the shape of a [[Maltese cross]].

==== The Cemetery Church ====
In the middle of the cemetery, a three-nave church was built at the beginning of the 5th century. The center ship had a mosaic floor; Narthex and side ships were covered with clay tiles. Under the floor of the church, graves were discovered. Later on, a grain store were added to the building and a vault where the church treasury was kept.

== Study on environmental influences on the ancient building materials in the archaeological park of Dion ==
In 2015, members of the Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, published a study on the condition of the stone building materials of the Asklepion and the Demeter Sanctuary. The aim of the study was to investigate the decay of the stone monuments and remains of buildings in the archaeological park of Dion. Mainly it was to be researched which environmental influences participate in which form in the decay process of the antique building materials in order to possibly preserve them. The building materials consist mainly of limestone, sandstone, conglomerate and marble.

The environmental conditions:

* High humidity, frequent rainfall
* Great temperature fluctuations
* High occurrence of surface and groundwater
* Increased chemical, biological and mechanical weathering by the surrounding plants and trees

Mostly the surfaces are covered with salt and a black crust containing calcium, magnesium, soda, potash and other substances.

The studies were performed by using different microscopes and a spectrometer. From December 2010 to November 2011, monthly samples of precipitation were taken. These samples and water samples of the Vaphyras and other waters were analyzed. The temperature fluctuations of the rocks were measured with infrared thermometers.

The researchers found various organic and inorganic substances that influence the weathering of the monuments. However, the main factor influencing the decomposition of the material is the penetration of water. In combination with heat and cold, it reduces the cohesion of the surface structure and thus leads to the instability of the ancient building material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306379048_Characterization_and_Weathering_of_the_Building_Materials_of_Sanctuaries_in_the_Archaeological_Site_of_Dion_Greece_Citation|title=Characterization and Weathering of the Building Materials of Sanctuaries in the Archaeological Site of Dion}}&lt;/ref&gt;	

== The Archaeological Walk ==
The archaeological walk takes place every year as part of the Olympus Festival. Teachers of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki guiding through the archaeological park and inform about various topics that touch ancient Dion. The arc spans from Greek mythology, the kingdom of Macedonia and the individual attractions of the park to daily life in the days of Alexander the Great. Embedded in the program is the performance of a short play or the recitation of ancient texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalolympou.gr/program/?pno=8|title=Program of the Olympus Festival, 22.

The  '''Atlantic Equatorial Mode''' or '''Atlantic Niño''' is a [[quasiperiodic]] interannual [[climate pattern]] of the equatorial [[Atlantic Ocean]].  It is the dominant mode of year-to-year variability that results in alternating warming and cooling episodes of [[sea surface temperatures]] accompanied by changes in atmospheric circulation.&lt;ref name="WangAOML"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wang | first = Chunzai | title = ENSO, Atlantic climate variability, and the Walker and Hadley circulations. Chapter 6 in The Hadley Circulation: Present, Past, and Future | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | year = 2005 | location = | pages = 173–202 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/docs/Wang_Hadley_Camera.pdf | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Atlantic Niño comes from its close similarity with the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) that dominates the tropical Pacific basin. The Atlantic Niño is not the same as the Atlantic Meridional (Interhemispheric) Mode that consists of a north-south dipole and operates more on decadal timescales.&lt;ref name="Zebiak, 1993, p.1570"&gt;Zebiak, 1993, p.1570&lt;/ref&gt;  The equatorial warming and cooling events associated with the Atlantic Niño are known to be strongly related to atmospheric climate anomalies, especially in African countries bordering the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. Therefore, understanding of the Atlantic Niño (or lack thereof) has important implications for climate prediction in those regions.  Although the Atlantic Niño is an intrinsic mode to the equatorial Atlantic, there may be a tenuous causal relationship between ENSO and the Atlantic Niño in some circumstances.

== Background and Structure ==

Global tropical variability is dominated by ENSO in the equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon results from air-sea interaction, producing a coupled atmosphere-ocean system that oscillates with periods on the order of three to five years.  However, the physical basis for this oscillation is not limited strictly to the Pacific basin, and indeed, a very similar mode of variability exists in the equatorial Atlantic, albeit on a smaller scale.

The Atlantic Niño is characterized by a [[sea surface temperature]] anomaly centered on the equator between 0° and 30°W.  Unlike its Pacific counterpart, the Atlantic Niño does not have sea surface temperature anomalies that switch sign from east to west, but rather a single basin-wide anomaly.  Additionally, the amplitude of the Atlantic Niño tends to be about half that of El Niño.  Not surprisingly, this sea surface temperature anomaly is closely related to a change in the climatological [[trade winds]].  A warm anomaly is associated with relaxed trade winds across a large swath of the equatorial Atlantic basin, while a cool anomaly is associated with enhanced easterly wind stress in the same region.  These trade wind fluctuations can be understood as the weakening and strengthening of the Atlantic [[Walker circulation]].  This is strikingly similar to the wind stress anomalies seen in the Pacific during El Niño (or La Niña) events, although centered farther west in the Atlantic basin.  A major difference between El Niño and the Atlantic Niño is that the sea surface temperature anomalies are strictly constrained to the equator in the Atlantic case, while greater meridional extent is observed in the Pacific.&lt;ref name="Zebiak, 1993, p.1568-1572"&gt;Zebiak, 1993, p.1568-1572&lt;/ref&gt;

While the spatial characteristics of the mature Atlantic Niño are quite similar to its Pacific counterpart, its temporal variability is somewhat different. The Atlantic Niño varies on interannual timescales like El Niño, but also shows more variance on seasonal and annual timescales.  That is to say, the Atlantic Niño explains a smaller portion of the total variance in the equatorial Atlantic than does El Niño in the equatorial Pacific.  This is due to the fact that there are seasonal climate events that are superimposed on the interannual variability.  The Atlantic Niño typically reaches mature phase in boreal summer (though there are exceptions), while El Niño matures in boreal winter.  The development of the Atlantic Niño tends to be marked by emerging stationary patterns centered mid-basin.  This is in stark contrast to El Niño, which can often develop as warm sea surface temperature anomalies that migrate west from the coast of South America or migrate east from the central Pacific.&lt;ref name="Zebiak, 1993, p.1568-1572"/&gt;

== Impact on African Climate ==

Warming or cooling of the equatorial oceans has understandable consequences for atmospheric climate.  The equatorial oceans comprise a major portion of the overall heat budget and, therefore, alter convective regimes near the equator.  In the case of the Pacific El Niño, enhanced convection over the central Pacific and reduced convection over the Maritime Continent fundamentally change climate not just in the tropics, but globally.  Since the Atlantic Niño is physically similar to ENSO, we might expect climate impacts from it as well.  However, given its reduced size both spatially (the Atlantic basin is much smaller than the Pacific basin) and in magnitude, the climate impacts of the Atlantic Niño are best seen in the tropical and subtropical regions nearest to the equatorial Atlantic.

The impact of the Atlantic Niño on African climate can be best understood by assessing how above normal equatorial sea surface temperatures impact the seasonal migration of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)]].  Warm equatorial sea surface temperatures lower surface air pressure which induces more equatorward flow than normal.  This, in turn, prevents the ITCZ from migrating as far north as it would under normal conditions during the summer, reducing rainfall in the semi-arid [[Sahel]] to the north, and increasing rainfall in regions along the Gulf of Guinea.&lt;ref name="Goddard and Mason, 2002"&gt;Goddard and Mason, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Increased rainfall relative to normal is typically associated with negative temperature anomalies over these tropical land areas. Some evidence suggests that a warming trend in Indian Ocean equatorial sea surface temperatures contributes to long-term drying of the Sahel, which is exacerbated by periodic warming of the equatorial Atlantic related to the Atlantic Niño.&lt;ref&gt;Giannini et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the ability to predict the Atlantic Niño is a major research question given its impact on seasonal climate.&lt;ref name="Goddard and Mason, 2002"/&gt;

== Relationship Between El Niño and the Atlantic Niño ==

Global tropical variability is largely dominated by the Pacific El Niño, leaving as a valid question whether the Atlantic Niño might be a remote impact of El Niño.  There is no apparent contemporaneous relationship between the two,&lt;ref name="Zebiak, 1993, p.1570"/&gt; but such a statement is not necessarily useful considering that El Niño peaks in winter while the Atlantic Niño peaks in summer.  Lagged analyzes reveal that the most prominent El Niño impact on the tropical Atlantic the following spring and summer is a warm sea surface temperature anomaly centered north of the Atlantic Niño region.  This again appears to suggest that there is not causal relationship.  However, more rigorous analysis suggests that the competition between cooling that results from increased wind stress and warming that results from increased air temperature, both of which are remote impacts of El Niño on the Atlantic, accounts for a tenuous relationship.  When one of these processes dominates over the other, an Atlantic Niño (warm or cool) event could ensue.&lt;ref&gt;Chang et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This is of major interest considering the challenge in seasonal prediction of the Atlantic Niño.

== Construction ==
[[File:Datacenter Backup Batteries.jpg|thumb|right| A rechargeable battery bank used in a data center]]
Structurally battery storage power plants and [[Uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies (UPS)]] are comparable, although the former are larger. The batteries are housed for security in their own warehouses or in containers. As with a UPS, the problem is that electrochemical energy is stored or emitted  in the form of [[Direct current|direct current DC]], while electric power networks are usually operated with [[Alternating current|Alternating current AC]] voltage. For this reason, additional inverters are needed to connect the battery storage power plants to the high voltage network. This kind of power electronics include GTO thyristors, commonly used in the [[High-voltage direct current|high-voltage direct current transmission (HVDC)]].
Various accumulator systems may be used depending on the power-to-energy ratio, the expected life time and, of course, the costs. In the 1980s, lead-acid batteries were used for the first battery-storage power plants. During the next few decades, nickel-cadmium and sodium-sulfur battery were increasingly used.&lt;ref name="elsoc1"/&gt; Since 2010, more and more utility-scale battery storage plants rely on lithium-ion batteries thanks to the fast decrease in the cost of this technology, driven by the electric automotive industry. This is the case of the battery Park Schwerin, the battery storage in Dresden or the storage of BYD in Hong Kong.  [[Lithium-ion battery|Lithium-ion batteries]] are mainly used, some [[Flow battery|redox flow]] system have emerged and lead-acid batteries are still used in small budget applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pv-magazine.de/nachrichten/details/beitrag/groe-batteriespeicher-erobern-die-stromnetze_100019866/?L=1%27&amp;cHash=6c7355d81d45667fe156f1fd8ece117a ''Große Batteriespeicher erobern die Stromnetze'']. pv-magazine.de.

== Operating characteristics ==

Since they do not require any mechanical movement, battery storage power plants allow extremely short control times and start times, in the range of few 10s of ms at full load. Thanks to that reactivity, they can [[Load management|shave power peaks]] in the range of minutes, but they can also dampen the fast oscillations (second) that appear when electric power networks are operated close to their maximum capacity. These instabilities consist in voltage fluctuations with periods of up to several 10 seconds and can soar in worst cases to high amplitudes, which can lead to regional blackouts. A battery storage power plants properly dimensioned can efficiently counteract these oscillations. Therefore, applications are found primarily in those regions where electrical power systems are operated at full capacity, causing a risk in the grid stability. Large storage plants  (Na-S)can also be used in combination with (Na-S)intermittent renewable energy source in [[Stand-alone power system|standalone hybrid micro-grids]]. 

Some systems, operating at high temperature ([[Sodium–sulfur battery|Na-S]]) or using corrosive components are subject to failure even if they are not used (calendar ageing). Other technologies suffer from deterioration caused by charge-discharge cycles (cycle ageing), especially at high charging rates. These two types of ageing cause a loss of performance (capacity or voltage decrease), overheating and may eventually lead to critical failure (electrolyte leaks, fire, explosion). In order to prevent the loss of performance due to ageing, some batteries can undergo maintenance operation. For example, non-sealed [[Lead–acid battery|Lead-acid batteries]] produce hydrogen and oxygen from the aqueous electrolyte when overcharged. The water has to be refilled regularly to avoid damage to the battery and the inflammable gases have to be vented out to avoid explosion risks. However, this maintenance has a cost and recent batteries, such as [[Lithium-ion battery|Li-Ion]], are designed to have a long lifespan without maintenance. Therefore, most of the current systems are composed of securely sealed [[Battery pack|battery packs]] which are electronically monitored and replaced once their performance falls below a given threshold.

== Installation examples ==

Some of the largest battery storage power plants are exemplified below.

=== Chino Battery Storage Project ===
Operated from 1988 to 1997 by the [[Southern California Edison]] in the Californian city [[Chino, California|Chino]], the battery storage power station served primarily for grid stabilization and could be used by frequent power outages in the region as a static var compensator and black start of non-black bootable power plants. The plant had a peak power of 14 MW, which was, however, far too little for effective stabilization in the net of Southern California Edison, and a storage capacity of 40 MWh. The system consisted of 8,256 lead-acid batteries in eight strands, which were divided into two halls.&lt;ref name="trueb"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Lucien F.

=== Golden Valley Electric – Fairbanks ===
One of the largest and located with Stand 2010 operating system is operated by the Golden Valley Electric in [[Fairbanks]]. The power grid in Alaska is operated due to the large distances as stand-alone grid with no direct connection to neighboring North American interconnections within the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. The battery storage power plant with a maximum capacity of 27 MW is used to stabilize the grid, covering high peak and reactive power compensation. The plant was put into operation in 2003 and consists of 13,760 nickel-cadmium batteries in four strands. The NiCd cells are manufactured by [[Saft Groupe S.A.]], the inverters by [[ABB Group]].&lt;ref name="elsoc1"/&gt;

=== BYD in Hongkong ===
The Chinese company BYD operates a battery banks with 40 MWh capacity and 20 MW maximum power in [[Hong Kong]]. The large storage is used to cushion load peaks in energy demand. Likewise, the storage can contribute to the frequency stabilization in the net. The battery is made up of a total of almost 60,000 individual [[lithium iron phosphate]] cells, each with 230 amp hour capacity. The project was started in October 2013, and went online in June 2014. The actual installation of the storage lasted three months. The use of price differences between loading and unloading by day and night electricity, an avoided grid expansion for peak loads and revenue for grid services such as Frequency stabilization enable economic operation without subsidies. Currently 3 locations for a 1,000 MW peak power to 200 MWh capacity storage power plant to be examined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20141126160136/http://www.solarserver.de/solar-magazin/nachrichten/aktuelles/2014/kw42/byd-bringt-weltgroessten-batteriespeicher-ans-netz.html solarserver.de:] BYD bringt weltgrößten Batteriespeicher ans Netz&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrid Battery power plant Braderup ===
Since July 2014, the energy storage company Nord GmbH &amp; Co. KG has been operating the largest hybrid batteries in Europe in [[Braderup]] ([[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany). The System consists of a [[lithium-ion battery]] storage (2 MW power 2 MWh storage) and a [[Vanadium redox battery|vanadium flow battery]] storage (330&amp;nbsp;kW power, 1 MWh storage capacity). The lithium-ion modules used are from Sony, the flow battery is made by Vanadis Power GmbH.

The storage system is connected to the local community wind park (18 MW installed capacity). Depending on wind strength and charging status of each battery a system developed by Bosch distributes the energy generated by the wind turbines to the right battery. Bosch is also responsible for project implementation and system integration. The hybrid battery is connected to the power grid by a ten-kilometer long underground cable. In case of a network congestion the batteries buffer the energy of the wind farm and feed it back into the grid at a convenient time later. With this method, a shutdown of wind turbines can be avoided during times of network congestion so that the energy of the wind is not wasted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bosch-presse.de/presseforum/details.htm?txtID=6876 bosch-presse.de:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321015218/http://www.bosch-presse.de/presseforum/details.htm?txtID=6876 |date=2016-03-21 }} Megawatt-Projekt nahe der Nordsee: Stromspeicher Braderup in Betrieb – Hybridbatterie für flexibles Windstrom-Management&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Storage in southern England with special control ====
In southern England a battery storage with a capacity of 0.6 MWh and 0.3 MW power was installed for demonstration purposes, made up of 1400 lithium cells installed in a container, with a special feature being the control of the storage.
Whereas usually a battery storage uses only revenue model, the provision of control energy,  which is a very small market, this storage uses three revenue models. The storage has been installed next to a solar system. This way the solar system can be designed larger than the grid power actually permits in the first revenue model. The storage accepts a peak input of the solar system, thus avoiding the cost of a further grid expansion. The second model allows taking up peak input from the power grid and feeding it back to stabilize the grid when necessary. The third model is storing energy and feeding it into the grid at peak prices. The store received an award for top innovation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pv-magazine.de/nachrichten/details/beitrag/pv-magazine-award-fr-groen-verteilnetz-speicher_100022304/ ''pv magazine award für großen Verteilnetz-Speicher'']. pv-magazine.de.

== Market development ==
In the US, the market for storage power plants in 2015 increased by 243 percent compared to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pv-magazine.de/nachrichten/details/beitrag/usa--speichermarkt-wchst-um-243-prozent-im-jahr-2015_100022293/?L=1%2F&amp;cHash=354a077b67e7c4907ad384dc9d5b6abf ''USA: Speichermarkt wächst um 243 Prozent im Jahr 2015'']. pv-magazine.de. retrieved, 11 Märch 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the UK grid operator National Grid posted independent from technology 200 MW of control power to increase system stability. In this case, only battery storage power plants won the auction. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwr.de/news.php?id=32008 ''Vattenfall meldet Zuschlag für Batterie-Großprojekt''].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1169">'''Bistonis''' is the name of a [[nymph]] in [[Greek mythology]] who gave birth to a son of [[Ares]], [[Tereus]]. Although she is mentioned in several surviving classical texts, she is the main subject of few or none.  In at least one poem, written by [[Moschus]] in the 3rd century BCE, [[Lake Bistonis]], in [[Thrace]], is referred to as being ''her''  lake, and that lake is described as having a population of nymphs:&lt;ref&gt;THE MOURNING FOR BION.; TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK OF MOSCHUS.JAMES GILBORNE LYONS The Knickerbocker; or New York Monthly Magazine (1833-1862); Dec 1849; 34, 6; APS Online&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|Tell all the nymphs by Bistonis’ clear lake,
The Orpheus of the Dorian isle is dead.}} 

Her name is similar to the name of a city in [[Thrace]], [[Bistonia]], said in ancient [[Greek mythology]] to have been built on the shores of that lake by [[Biston]], who was the son of [[Ares]] and Callirrhoe.

== Properties ==
Experimentally various atomically-thin, [[crystal]]line and [[metal]]lic borophenes were synthesized on clean metal surfaces under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions.&lt;ref name="Mannix2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feng2016"/&gt; Their atomic structure is still debated, but most likely it consists of mixed triangular and hexagonal motives, such as shown in Figure 1. The atomic structure is a consequence of an interplay between two-center and multi-center in-plane bonding, which is typical for [[Electron deficiency|electron deficient]] elements like boron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pauling |first1=Linus |title=The nature of the chemical bond |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=0801403332 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Borophene.png|thumb|150px|Figure 2: A {{chem|B|36}} cluster might be seen as smallest borophene; front and side view]]
Computational studies by I. Boustani and A. Quandt showed that small boron clusters do not adopt icosahedral geometries likes [[boranes]], instead they turn out to be quasi-planar (see Figure 2).&lt;ref name="Boustani1997"/&gt;
This lead to the discovery of a so called Aufbau principle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boustani |first1=Ihsan |title=Systematic ab initio investigation of bare boron clusters: Determination of the geometry and electronic structures of B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (n=2-14)|journal=Physical Review B |date=15 June 1997 |volume=55 |issue=24 |pages=16426–16438 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.55.16426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These borophene structures were also predicted to be metallic. The so called γ sheet (a.k.a. β&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; borophene or υ&lt;sub&gt;1/6&lt;/sub&gt; sheet) is shown in Figure 1(a).&lt;ref name="Ozdogan2010"/&gt;

Later they showed that the structure of {{chem|B|36}} (see Figure 2) is the smallest boron cluster to have sixfold symmetry and a perfect hexagonal vacancy, and it can be viewed as a potential basis for extended two-dimensional boron sheets.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;

Atomic-scale characterization, supported by theoretical calculations, revealed structures reminiscent of fused boron clusters consisting mixed triangular and hexagonal motives, such as predicted by theory before and shown in Figure 1. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy indicates that the borophenes are indeed metallic. This is in contrast to [[Allotropes of boron|bulk boron allotropes]], which are semiconducting and marked by an atomic structure based on B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; icosahedra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4258">In physics, '''coherent backscattering''' is observed when [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] radiation (such as a [[laser]] beam) propagates through a medium which has a large number of [[scattering]] centers (such as milk or a thick cloud) of size comparable to the wavelength of the radiation.

[[Image:coherent backscattering.png|thumb|300px|Propagation of two rays in a random medium. Since one can be obtained from the other by time inversion, they interfere coherently when the angle &amp;theta; goes to zero.]]

The waves are scattered many times while traveling through the medium. Even for incoherent radiation, the scattering typically reaches a [[maxima and minima|local maximum]] in the direction of [[backscattering]]. For coherent radiation, however, the peak is two times higher.

Coherent backscattering is very difficult to detect and measure for two reasons. The first is fairly obvious, that it is difficult to measure the direct backscatter without blocking the beam, but there are methods for overcoming this problem. The second is that the peak is usually extremely sharp around the backward direction, so that a very high level of [[angular resolution]] is needed for the detector to see the peak without averaging its intensity out over the surrounding angles where the intensity can undergo large dips. At angles other than the backscatter direction, the light intensity is subject to numerous essentially random fluctuations called [[speckle pattern|speckles]].

This is one of the most robust [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] phenomena that survives multiple scattering, and it is regarded as an aspect of a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon known as [[weak localization]] (Akkermans et al. 1986). In weak localization, interference of the direct and reverse paths leads to a net reduction of light transport in the forward direction. This phenomenon is typical of any coherent wave which is multiple scattered. It is typically discussed for light waves, for which it is similar to the weak localization phenomenon for electrons in disordered (semi)conductors and often seen as the precursor to [[Anderson localization|Anderson]] (or strong) localization of light. Weak localization of light can be detected since it is manifested as an enhancement of light intensity in the backscattering direction. This substantial enhancement is called the cone of coherent backscattering.

Coherent backscattering has its origin in the interference between direct and reverse paths in the backscattering direction. When a multiply scattering medium is illuminated by a laser beam, the scattered intensity results from the interference between the amplitudes associated with the various scattering paths; for a disordered medium, the interference terms are washed out when averaged over many sample configurations, except in a narrow angular range around exact backscattering where the average intensity is enhanced. This phenomenon, is the result of many sinusoidal two-waves interference patterns which add up. The cone is the Fourier transform of the spatial distribution of the intensity of the scattered light on the sample surface, when the latter is illuminated by a point-like source. The enhanced backscattering relies on the constructive interference between reverse paths. One can make an analogy with a Young's interference experiment, where two diffracting slits would be positioned in place of the "input" and "output" scatterers.

Also like Earth, Mars is a [[planetary differentiation|differentiated planet]], meaning that it has a central [[planetary core|core]] made up of metallic [[iron]] and [[nickel]] surrounded by a less dense, silicate [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[crust (geology)|crust]].&lt;ref name="Nimmo 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nimmo |first1=Francis |last2=Tanaka |first2=Ken |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.33.092203.122637 |title=Early Crustal Evolution Of Mars |year=2005 |pages=133–161 |issue=1 |volume=33 |journal=[[Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences]] |url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~nimmo/website/version3.doc |bibcode=2005AREPS..33..133N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planet's distinctive red color is due to the [[oxidation]] of iron on its surface.

Much of what we know about the elemental composition of Mars comes from orbiting [[spacecraft]] and landers. (See [[Exploration of Mars]] for list.) Most of these spacecraft carry [[spectrometer]]s and other instruments to measure the surface composition of Mars by either [[remote sensing]] from orbit or ''[[in situ]]'' analyses on the surface. We also have many actual samples of Mars in the form of [[meteorites]] that have made their way to Earth. [[Martian meteorites]] (often called SNC's, for [[Shergottite]]s, [[Nakhlite]]s, and [[Chassignite]]s&lt;ref name="ISBN 0-8165-1257-4"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last= Kieffer |editor1-first= H.H. |editor2-last= Jakosky | editor2-first= B.M. |editor3-last= Snyder |editor3-first= C.W. |editor4-last=  Matthews |editor4-first= M.S. | display-editors = 3|title=Mars |publisher= University of Arizona Press |location= Tucson |year= 1992 | isbn = 978-0-8165-1257-7 |page={{page needed|date=January 2011}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;—the groups of meteorites first shown to have a martian origin) provide data on the chemical composition of Mars' crust and interior that would not otherwise be available except through a [[sample return mission]].

Based on these data sources, scientists think that the most abundant chemical elements in the Martian crust, besides silicon and oxygen, are iron, [[magnesium]], [[aluminum]], [[calcium]], and [[potassium]]. These elements are major components of the minerals comprising [[igneous]] rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Press, F.; Siever, R. (1978). ''Earth,'' 2nd ed.; W.H.

On 16 December 2014, NASA reported the ''Curiosity'' rover detected a "tenfold spike", likely localized, in the amount of [[methane]] in the [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]]. Sample measurements taken "a dozen times over 20 months" showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014, averaging "7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere."

The elemental composition of Mars is different from Earth′s in several significant ways.

Mars is fundamentally an [[Igneous rock|igneous]] planet. Rocks on the surface and in the crust consist predominantly of minerals that crystallize from [[magma]]. Most of our current knowledge about the [[mineral]] composition of Mars comes from spectroscopic data from orbiting spacecraft, ''in situ'' analyses of rocks and soils from six landing sites, and study of the Martian meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= McSween | first1= Harry Y. | title= SNC Meteorites: Clues to Martian Petrologic Evolution? | journal= Reviews of Geophysics | volume= 23 | issue= 4 |pages= 391–416 | year= 1985 | bibcode = 1985RvGeo..23..391M | doi = 10.1029/RG023i004p00391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectrometers currently in orbit include [[THEMIS]] ([[Mars Odyssey]]), OMEGA ([[Mars Express]]), and [[CRISM]] ([[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]). The two [[Mars exploration rovers]] each carry an Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer ([[APXS]]), a thermal emission spectrometer ([[Mini-TES]]), and [[Mössbauer spectroscopy|Mössbauer]] spectrometer to identify minerals on the surface.

On October 17, 2012, the [[Curiosity rover]] on the [[Mars|planet Mars]] at "[[Rocknest (Mars)|Rocknest]]" performed the first [[X-ray crystallography#Mineralogy and metallurgy|X-ray diffraction analysis]] of [[Martian soil]]. The results from the rover's [[CheMin|CheMin analyzer]] revealed the presence of several minerals, including [[feldspar]], [[pyroxenes]] and [[olivine]], and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the "weathered [[Basalt|basaltic soils]]" of [[Hawaii Volcanoes|Hawaiian volcanoes]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20121030"&gt;{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Dwayne |title=NASA Rover's First Soil Studies Help Fingerprint Martian Minerals |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/oct/HQ_12-383_Curiosity_CheMin.html |date=October 30, 2012 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary rocks and minerals ===
{{MarsRocks}}
The dark areas of Mars are characterised by the [[mafic]] rock-forming minerals [[olivine]], [[pyroxene]], and [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]. These minerals are the primary constituents of [[basalt]], a dark volcanic rock that also makes up the Earth's oceanic crust and the [[Lunar mare|lunar maria]].
[[File:Olivine valles marineris.jpg|thumb|left|Mars Odyssey THEMIS false-colour image of olivine basalts in the Valles Marineris. Layers rich in olivine appear purple.]]
[[File:PIA16089.jpg|thumb|right|First [[Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy|Laser Spectrum]] of [[chemical elements]] from [[Chemistry and Camera complex|ChemCam]] on the [[Curiosity Rover]] ([[N165|"Coronation" rock]], August 19, 2012).]]
The mineral olivine occurs all over the planet, but some of the largest concentrations are in [[Nili Fossae]], an area containing [[Noachian]]-aged rocks. Another large olivine-rich outcrop is in [[Ganges Chasma]], an eastern side chasm of [[Valles Marineris]] (pictured).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Pretty Green Mineral -- Pretty Dry Mars?|author=Linda M.V. Martel|publisher=psrd.hawaii.edu|url=http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Nov03/olivine.html|accessdate=2007-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Olivine weathers rapidly into clay minerals in the presence of liquid water. Therefore, areas with large outcroppings of olivine-bearing rock indicate that liquid water has not been abundant since the rocks formed.&lt;ref name="ISBN 0-8165-1257-4"/&gt;

Pyroxene minerals are also widespread across the surface. Both low-calcium (ortho-) and high-calcium (clino-) pyroxenes are present, with the high-calcium varieties associated with younger [[shield volcano|volcanic shields]] and the low-calcium forms ([[enstatite]]) more common in the old highland terrain. Because enstatite melts at a higher temperature than its high-calcium cousin, some researchers have argued that its presence in the highlands indicates that older magmas on Mars had higher temperatures than younger ones.&lt;ref&gt;Soderblom, L.A.; Bell, J.F.

True intermediate and [[felsic]] rocks are present on Mars, but exposures are uncommon. Both TES and the [[Thermal Emission Imaging System]] (THEMIS) on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft have identified high-silica rocks in Syrtis Major and near the southwestern rim of the crater [[Antoniadi (Martian crater)|Antoniadi]]. The rocks have spectra resembling quartz-rich [[dacite]]s and [[granite|granitoids]], suggesting that at least some parts of the Martian crust may have a diversity of igneous rocks similar to Earth's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bandfield | first1=Joshua L. | title=Identification of quartzofeldspathic materials on Mars | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research | volume=109 | issue=E10 | pages=E10009 | year=2004 | doi=10.1029/2004JE002290 | bibcode=2004JGRE..10910009B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some geophysical evidence suggests that the bulk of the Martian crust may actually consist of [[basaltic andesite]] or andesite. The andesitic crust is hidden by overlying basaltic lavas that dominate the surface composition but are volumetrically minor.&lt;ref name="Nimmo 2005" /&gt;

Rocks studied by [[Spirit Rover]] in Gusev crater can be classified in different ways.  The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts—also called picritic basalts.  The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic [[komatiites]].  Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic [[shergottite]]s, meteorites which came from Mars.  One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, [[picrobasalt]], and tephite.  The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts.&lt;ref name="McSween 2004"&gt;McSween, etal.  2004.  Basaltic Rocks Analyzed by the Spirit Rover in Gusev Crater.

In the journal Science from September 2013, researchers described a different type of rock called "''[[Jake M (rock)|Jake M]]''" or "''[[Jake M (rock)|Jake Matijevic (rock)]]'',” It was the first rock analyzed by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer instrument on the Curiosity rover, and it was different from other known martian igneous rocks as it is alkaline (&gt;15% normative nepheline) and relatively fractionated.

Using SAM’s [[mass spectrometer]], scientists measured [[isotopes]] of [[helium]], [[neon]], and [[argon]] that [[cosmic rays]] produce as they go through rock. The fewer of these isotopes they find, the more recently the rock has been exposed near the surface. The 4-billion-year-old lakebed rock drilled by Curiosity was uncovered between 30 million and 110 million years ago by winds which sandblasted away 2 meters of overlying rock. Next, they hope to find a site tens of millions of years younger by drilling close to an overhanging outcrop.&lt;ref name="SCI-2013-Farley"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farley, K. |display-authors=etal |year=2013 |title=In Situ Radiometric and Exposure Age Dating of the Martian Surface. |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|doi=10.1126/science.1247166 |bibcode = 2014Sci...343F.386H |volume=343 |issue=6169 |pages=1247166 |pmid=24324273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absorbed dose and dose equivalent from galactic cosmic rays and [[solar energetic particle]]s on the Martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum was measured.

Much of the Martian surface is deeply covered by dust as fine as talcum powder. The global predominance of dust obscures the underlying bedrock, making spectroscopic identification of primary minerals impossible from orbit over many areas of the planet. The red/orange appearance of the dust is caused by [[iron(III) oxide]] ([[nanophase]] Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and the [[iron(III) oxide-hydroxide]] mineral [[goethite]].&lt;ref name="Peplow2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040503/full/news040503-6.html|doi=10.1038/news040503-6 |title=How Mars got its rust |accessdate=2006-04-18 |last=Peplow |first=Mark |date=2004-05-06 |journal=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mars Exploration Rovers]] identified [[magnetite]] as the mineral responsible for making the dust magnetic.  It probably also contains some [[titanium]].&lt;ref name="Bertelsen, P. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bertelsen, P. |year=2004  |title=Magnetic Properties on the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit at Gusev Crater.  |journal=Science |volume=305 |pages=827–829 |accessdate= |bibcode = 2004Sci...305..827B |doi = 10.1126/science.1100112 |pmid=15297664 |issue=5685|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global dust cover and the presence of other wind-blown sediments has made soil compositions remarkably uniform across the Martian surface.

=== Secondary (alteration) minerals ===
Minerals produced through [[hydrothermal alteration]] and [[weathering]] of primary basaltic minerals are also present on Mars. Secondary minerals include [[hematite]], [[phyllosilicates]] (clay minerals), [[goethite]], [[jarosite]], iron [[sulphates|sulfate]] minerals, [[opal|opaline silica]], and [[gypsum]]. Many of these secondary minerals require liquid water to form (aqueous minerals).

Opaline silica and iron sulphate minerals form in acidic (low pH) solutions.

=== Sedimentary rocks ===

[[File:Huygens Crater.jpg|thumb|Huygens Crater with circle showing place where carbonate was discovered. This deposit may represent a time when Mars had abundant liquid water on its surface. Scale bar is 250 km long.]] 
Layered sedimentary deposits are widespread on Mars. These deposits probably consist of both [[sedimentary rock]] and poorly [[hardness|indurated]] or unconsolidated sediments. Thick sedimentary deposits occur in the interior of several canyons in Valles Marineris, within large craters in Arabia and [[Meridiani Planum]] (see [[Henry Crater]] for example), and probably comprise much of the deposits in the northern lowlands (e.g., [[Vastitas Borealis]] Formation). The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landed in an area containing cross-bedded (mainly [[eolian processes|eolian]]) [[sandstone]]s (Burns formation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2005.09.039 | last1 = Grotzinger | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Arvidson | year = 2005 | first2 = R.E. | last3 = Bell Iii | first3 = J.F. | last4 = Calvin | first4 = W. | last5 = Clark | first5 = B.C. | last6 = Fike | first6 = D.A. | last7 = Golombek | first7 = M. | last8 = Greeley | first8 = R. | last9 = Haldemann | first9 = A. | last10 = Herkenhoff | first10 = K.E. | last11 = Jolliff | first11 = B.L. | last12 = Knoll | first12 = A.H. | last13 = Malin | first13 = M. | last14 = McLennan | first14 = S.M. | last15 = Parker | first15 = T. | last16 = Soderblom | first16 = L. | last17 = Sohl-Dickstein | first17 = J.N. | last18 = Squyres | first18 = S.W. | last19 = Tosca | first19 = N.J. | last20 = Watters | first20 = W.A. | title = Stratigraphy and Sedimentology of a Dry to Wet Eolian Depositional System, Burns formation, Meridiani Planum, Mars | url = | journal = [[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]] | volume = 240 | issue = 1| pages = 11–72 | bibcode=2005E&amp;PSL.240...11G| display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Fluvial-deltaic deposits are present in [[Eberswalde Crater]] and elsewhere, and photogeologic evidence suggests that many craters and low lying intercrater areas in the southern highlands contain Noachian-aged lake sediments.

While the possibility of [[carbonates on Mars]] has been of great interest to exobiologists and geochemists alike, there was little evidence for significant quantities of carbonate deposits on the surface. In the summer of 2008, the TEGA and WCL experiments on the 2007 [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'']] Mars lander found between 3–5wt% (percent by weight) calcite (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and an alkaline soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Boynton | first1=WV | last2=Ming | first2=DW | last3=Kounaves | first3=SP | last4=Young | first4=SM | last5=Arvidson | first5=RE | last6=Hecht | first6=MH | last7=Hoffman | first7=J | last8=Niles | first8=PB | last9=Hamara | first9=DK | last10=Quinn | first10=R.

[[Carbonates]] (calcium or iron carbonates) were discovered in a crater on the rim of Huygens Crater, located in the [[Iapygia quadrangle]]. The impact on the rim exposed material that had been dug up from the impact that created Huygens. These minerals represent evidence that Mars once had a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere with abundant moisture, since these kind of carbonates only form when there is a lot of water. They were found with the [[Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars]] (CRISM) instrument on the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]. Earlier, the instrument had detected clay minerals. The carbonates were found near the clay minerals. Both of these minerals form in wet environments.  It is supposed that billions of years ago Mars was much warmer and wetter. At that time, carbonates would have formed from water and the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. Later the deposits of carbonate would have been buried.  The double impact has now exposed the minerals. Earth has vast carbonate deposits in the form of [[limestone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-071&amp;rn=news.xml&amp;rst=2929|title=News - Some of Mars' Missing Carbon Dioxide May be Buried|work=NASA/JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spirit Rover discoveries in the Aeolis quadrangle ==
The rocks on the plains of Gusev are a type of [[basalt]].  They contain the [[mineral]]s [[olivine]], [[pyroxene]], [[plagioclase]], and magnetite, and they look like volcanic basalt as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs).&lt;ref&gt;McSween, etal.  2004.  Basaltic Rocks Analyzed by the [[Spirit Rover]] in [[Gusev Crater]].  Science : 305. 842-845&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Arvidson, R. E., et al. (2004) Science, 305, 821-824&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the soil on the plains came from the breakdown of the local rocks.  Fairly high levels of [[nickel]] were found in some soils; probably from [[meteorites]].&lt;ref&gt;Gelbert, R., et al.  2006.  The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS): results from Gusev crater and calibration report.  J. Geophys. Res. – Planets: 111.&lt;/ref&gt;
Analysis shows that the rocks have been slightly altered by tiny amounts of water.  Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited minerals, maybe [[bromine]] compounds.  All the rocks contain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder rinds of material.  One type can be brushed off, while another needed to be ground off by the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (RAT).&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, P.  Initial Results from the Mini-TES Experiment in Gusev Crater from the Spirit Rover.  Science: 305. 837-842.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of rocks in the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)]], some of which have been altered by water, but not by very much water.

The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet.  All the dust was found to be magnetic.  Moreover, Spirit found the [[magnetism]] was caused by the mineral [[magnetite]], especially magnetite that contained the element [[titanium]].  One magnet was able to completely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen, P. 2004"/&gt;  The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like [[Tharsis]] and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites.  A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces.  Something in it contains a small amount of chemically bound water.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Bell, J (ed.)

Observations of rocks on the plains show they contain the minerals pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, and magnetite.  These rocks can be classified in different ways.  The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts—also called picritic basalts.  The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic [[komatiites]].  Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic [[shergottite]]s, meteorites which came from Mars.  One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, [[picrobasalt]], and tephite.  The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts.&lt;ref name="McSween 2004"/&gt;
Plain's rocks have been very slightly altered, probably by thin films of water because they are softer and contain veins of light colored material that may be bromine compounds, as well as coatings or rinds.  It is thought that small amounts of water may have gotten into cracks inducing mineralization processes).&lt;ref name="McSween 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;
Coatings on the rocks may have occurred when rocks were buried and interacted with thin films of water and dust.
One sign that they were altered was that it was easier to grind these rocks compared to the same types of rocks found on Earth.

The first rock that Spirit studied was Adirondack.  It turned out to be typical of the other rocks on the plains.

=== Columbia Hills ===
Scientists found a variety of rock types in the Columbia Hills, and they placed them into six different categories.  The six are: Adirondack, Clovis, Wishstone, Peace, Watchtower, Backstay, and Independence.  They are named after a prominent rock in each group.  Their chemical compositions, as measured by APXS, are significantly different from each other.&lt;ref name=Squyres&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Squyres|first1=Steven W.|last2=Arvidson|first2=Raymond E.|last3=Blaney|first3=Diana L.|last4=Clark|first4=Benton C.|last5=Crumpler|first5=Larry|last6=Farrand|first6=William H.|last7=Gorevan|first7=Stephen|last8=Herkenhoff|first8=Kenneth E.|last9=Hurowitz|first9=Joel|last10=Kusack|first10=Alastair|last11=McSween|first11=Harry Y.|last12=Ming|first12=Douglas W.|last13=Morris|first13=Richard V.|last14=Ruff|first14=Steven W.|last15=Wang|first15=Alian|last16=Yen|first16=Albert|title=Rocks of the Columbia Hills|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets|date=February 2006|volume=111|issue=E2|page=E02S11|doi=10.1029/2005JE002562|bibcode=2006JGRE..111.2S11S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly, all of the rocks in Columbia Hills show various degrees of alteration due to aqueous fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ming|first1=D.

They are enriched in the elements phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine—all of which can be carried around in water solutions.  The Columbia Hills' rocks contain basaltic glass, along with varying amounts of olivine and [[sulfate]]s.&lt;ref name=McSween&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McSween|first1=H. Y.|last2=Ruff|first2=S.

The olivine abundance varies inversely with the amount of sulfates.  This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce sulfates.

The Clovis group is especially interesting because the [[Mossbauer spectrometer]] (MB) detected [[goethite]] in it.&lt;ref name="Klingelhofer, G. 2005"/&gt; Goethite forms only in the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills's rocks. In addition, the MB spectra of rocks and outcrops displayed a strong decline in olivine presence,
although the rocks probably once contained much olivine.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=R. V.|last2=Klingelhöfer|first2=G.|last3=Schröder|first3=C.|last4=Rodionov|first4=D.

Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form.
Wishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and [[anhydrate]] (a sulfate).  Peace rocks showed [[sulfur]] and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected.  Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water.  The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group).  Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.
One type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], and [[iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ming | first1 = D. | year = 2006 | title = Geochemical and mineralogical indicators for aqueous processes in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater, Mars | url = | journal = J.

Also, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe&lt;sup&gt;+++&lt;/sup&gt; form, which would happen if water had been present.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Towards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure [[silica]] were found in the soil.  The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html |title=NASA - Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Spirit stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or [[Mini-TES]] and confirmed the presence of large amounts of [[carbonate]]-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water.

In summary, Spirit found evidence of slight weathering on the plains of Gusev, but no evidence that a lake was there.  However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering.  The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates which only form in the presence of water.  It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials.  All the dust contains a magnetic component which was identified as magnetite with some titanium.  Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.

[[Opportunity Rover]] found that the soil at [[Meridiani Planum]] was very similar to the soil at Gusev crater and Ares Vallis; however in many places at Meridiani the soil was covered with round, hard, gray spherules that were named "blueberries."&lt;ref name="Yen, A. 2005"&gt;Yen, A., et al.  2005.  An integrated view of the chemistry and mineralogy of martian soils.  Nature.  435.:  49-54.&lt;/ref&gt;  These blueberries were found to be composed almost entirely of the mineral [[hematite]].  It was decided that the spectra signal spotted from orbit by Mars Odyssey was produced by these spherules.  After further study it was decided that the blueberries were concretions formed in the ground by water.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Over time, these concretions weathered from what was overlying rock, and then became concentrated on the surface as a lag deposit.  The concentration of spherules in bedrock could have produced the observed blueberry covering from the weathering of as little as one meter of rock.&lt;ref name="Squyres, S. 2004"&gt;Squyres, S. et al.  2004.

Soils of [[Eagle Crater]] and Meridiani Planum at the Opportunity Rover Landing Site.  Science:  306.  1723-1726.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the soil consisted of olivine basalt sands that did not come from the local rocks.  The sand may have been transported from somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, P., et al.  Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover.  Science:  306. 1733-1739.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minerals in dust===
A Mossbauer spectrum was made of the dust that gathered on Opportunity's capture magnet.  The results suggested that the magnetic component of the dust was titanomagnetite, rather than just plain [[magnetite]], as was once thought.  A small amount of [[olivine]] was also detected which was interpreted as indicating a long arid period on the planet.  On the other hand, a small amount of hematite that was present meant that there may have been liquid water for a short time in the early history of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Goetz, W., et al.  2005.  Indication of drier periods on Mars from the chemistry and mineralogy of atmospheric dust.  Nature:  436.62-65.&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (RAT) found it easy to grind into the bedrocks, it is thought that the rocks are much softer than the rocks at Gusev crater.

===Bedrock minerals===
Few rocks were visible on the surface where Opportunity landed, but bedrock that was exposed in craters was examined by the suite of instruments on the Rover.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J., et al.  2004.  Pancam Multispectral Imaging Results from the Opportunity Rover at Meridiani Planum.  Science:  306.1703-1708.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bedrock rocks were found to be sedimentary rocks with a high concentration of [[sulfur]] in the form of calcium and [[magnesium sulfate]]s.  Some of the sulfates that may be present in bedrocks are [[kieserite]], sulfate anhydrate, bassanite, hexahydrite, [[epsomite]], and [[gypsum]].  [[Salt (chemistry)|Salt]]s, such as [[halite]], bischofite, antarcticite, bloedite, vanthoffite, or gluberite may also be present.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, P., et al.  2004 Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover.

Science:  306. 1709-1714.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PIA15034 Pancam sol2769 L257F.tif|thumb|"Homestake" formation]] 
The rocks contained the sulfates had a light tone compared to isolated rocks and rocks examined by landers/rovers at other locations on Mars.  The spectra of these light toned rocks, containing hydrated sulfates, were similar to spectra taken by the [[Thermal Emission Spectrometer]] on board the [[Mars Global Surveyor]].  The same spectrum is found over a large area, so it is believed that water once appeared over a wide region, not just in the area explored by Opportunity Rover.&lt;ref&gt;Hynek, B.  2004.  Implications for hydrologic processes on Mars from extensive bedrock outcrops throughout Terra Meridiani.  Nature:  431. 156-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer]] (APXS) found rather high levels of [[phosphorus]] in the rocks.  Similar high levels were found by other rovers at [[Ares Vallis]] and [[Gusev Crater]], so it has been hypothesized that the mantle of Mars may be phosphorus-rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dreibus | first1 = G. | last2 = Wanke | first2 = H. | year = 1987 | title = Volatiles on Earth and Marsw: a comparison | url = | journal = Icarus | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 225–240 | doi=10.1016/0019-1035(87)90148-5 | bibcode=1987Icar...71..225D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The minerals in the rocks could have originated by [[acid]] weathering of [[basalt]].  Because the solubility of phosphorus is related to the solubility of [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[rare earth elements]], they are all also expected to be enriched in rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rieder | first1 = R. | year = 2004 | title = Chemistry of Rocks and Soils at Meridiani Planum from the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer | url = | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5702| pages = 1746–1749 | doi=10.1126/science.1104358| pmid = 15576611 | display-authors = etal |bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1746R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Opportunity rover traveled to the rim of [[Endeavour crater]], it soon found a white vein that was later identified as being pure gypsum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20111207.html|title=NASA - NASA Mars Rover Finds Mineral Vein Deposited by Water|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120125093619.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  It was formed when water carrying gypsum in solution deposited the mineral in a crack in the rock.  A picture of this vein, called "Homestake" formation, is shown below.

Examination in 2004 of Meridiani rocks, showed the first strong ''in situ'' evidence for past water by detecting the mineral [[jarosite]], which  only forms in water.  This discovery proved that water once existed in [[Meridiani Planum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klingelhofer | first1 = G. | year = 2004 | title = Jarosite and Hematite at Meridiani Planum from Opportunity's Mossbauer Spectrometer | url = | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5702| pages = 1740–1745 | doi=10.1126/science.1104653| pmid = 15576610 | display-authors = etal |bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1740K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, some rocks showed small laminations (layers) with shapes that are only made by gently flowing water.&lt;ref name="Herkenhoff, K. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herkenhoff | first1 = K. | year = 2004 | title = Evidence from Opportunity's Microscopic Imager for Water on Meridian Planum | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230854| journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5702| pages = 1727–1730 | doi=10.1126/science.1105286| pmid = 15576607 | display-authors = etal |bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1727H | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first such laminations were found in a rock called "The Dells."  Geologists would say that the cross-stratification showed festoon geometry from transport in subaqueous ripples.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  A picture of cross-stratification, also called cross-bedding, is shown on the left.

Box-shaped holes in some rocks were caused by sulfates forming large crystals, and then when the crystals later dissolved, holes, called vugs, were left behind.&lt;ref name="Herkenhoff, K. 2004"/&gt;  The concentration of the element [[bromine]] in rocks was highly variable probably because it is very soluble.  Water may have concentrated it in places before it evaporated.  Another mechanism for concentrating highly soluble bromine compounds is frost deposition at night that would form very thin films of water that would concentrate bromine in certain spots.&lt;ref name="Yen, A. 2005"/&gt;

===Rock from impact===
One rock, "Bounce Rock," found sitting on the sandy plains was found to be ejecta from an impact crater.  Its chemistry was different from the bedrocks.  Containing mostly pyroxene and plagioclase and no olivine, it closely resembled a part, Lithology B, of the shergottite meteorite EETA 79001, a meteorite known to have come from Mars.  Bounce rock received its name by being near an airbag bounce mark.&lt;ref name="Squyres, S. 2004"/&gt;

===Meteorites===
Opportunity Rover found meteorites just sitting on the plains.  The first one analyzed with Opportunity's instruments was called "Heatshield Rock," as it was found near where Opportunity's heatshield landed.  Examination with the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer ([[Mini-TES]]), [[Mossbauer spectrometer]], and APXS lead researchers to, classify it as an [[IAB meteorites|IAB meteorite]].  The APXS determined it was composed of 93% [[iron]] and 7% [[nickel]].  The cobble named "Fig Tree Barberton" is thought to be a stony or stony-iron meteorite (mesosiderite silicate),&lt;ref&gt;Squyres, S., et al.  2009.  Exploration of Victoria Crater by the Mars Rover Opportunity.  Science:  1058-1061.&lt;/ref&gt; while "Allan Hills," and "Zhong Shan" may be iron meteorites.

===Geological history===
Observations at the site have led scientists to believe that the area was flooded with water a number of times and was subjected to evaporation and desiccation.&lt;ref name="Squyres, S. 2004"/&gt;  In the process sulfates were deposited.  After sulfates cemented the sediments, hematite concretions grew by precipitation from groundwater.  Some sulfates formed into large crystals which later dissolved to leave vugs.  Several lines of evidence point toward an arid climate in the past billion years or so, but a climate supporting water, at least for a time, in the distant past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = B. | year = 2005| title = Chemistry and mineralogy of outcrops at Meridiani Planum | url = | journal = Earth Planet.

{{humidity}}
The '''dew point depression''' ('''T-Td''') is the difference between the [[temperature]] and [[dew point]] temperature at a certain height in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].

For a constant temperature, the smaller the difference, the more [[moisture]] there is, and the higher the [[relative humidity]]. In the lower [[troposphere]], more moisture (small dew point depression) results in lower [[cloud base]]s and [[lifted condensation level]]s (LCL). LCL height is an important factor modulating severe [[thunderstorm]]s. One example concerns [[tornadogenesis]], with tornadoes most likely if the dew point depression is 20&amp;nbsp;°F (11&amp;nbsp;°C) or less, and the likelihood of large, intense [[tornado]]es increasing as dew point depression decreases. LCL height also factors in [[downburst]] and [[microburst]] activity. Conversely, instability is increased when there is a mid-level dry layer (large dew point depression) known as a "[[dry punch]]", which is favorable for [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] if the lower layer is [[buoyant]].

As it measures moisture content in the atmosphere, the dew point depression is also an important indicator in agricultural and forest meteorology, particularly in predicting [[wildfire]]s.

[[Image:EISCAT dish Kiruna.JPG|right|thumb|EISCAT Kiruna Radar (diameter 32m)]]

'''EISCAT''' ('''European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association''') operates three [[incoherent scatter]] [[radar]] systems, at 224&amp;nbsp;MHz, 931&amp;nbsp;MHz in Northern [[Scandinavia]] and one at 500&amp;nbsp;MHz on [[Svalbard]], used to study the interaction between the [[Sun]] and the [[Earth]] as revealed by disturbances in the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]]. At the Ramfjordmoen facility (near [[Tromsø]], [[Norway]]), it also operates an [[ionospheric heater]] facility, similar to [[HAARP]]. Additional receiver stations are located in [[Sodankylä]], [[Finland]], and [[Kiruna]], [[Sweden]]. The '''EISCAT Svalbard radar''' ('''ESR''') is located in [[Longyearbyen]], Norway. The EISCAT Headquarters are also located in [[Kiruna]].

EISCAT is funded and operated by research institutes and research councils of [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], [[China]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (the EISCAT Associates). Institutes in other countries also contribute to operations, including [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Germany]] and [[South Korea]].

The system was also tested for [[space debris]] [[space surveillance|tracking]] and the radars were proven to be capable of statistical observations of [[Low-Earth orbit]] (LEO) debris (altitudes of 500 to 1500&amp;nbsp;km) down to 2&amp;nbsp;cm in size. Since these measurements are insufficient to determine complete [[orbit]]s, the radar has only limited space surveillance value.&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bulletin133/bul133f_klinkrad.pdf|title=Europe's Eyes on the Skies|publisher=[[ESA]]|access-date=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the space debris tracking change is only a dedicated back-end computer system, the primary EISCAT observations are not compromised. As a result of that, the EISCAT radars allow continuous monitoring of the LEO debris in a [[beam park]] mode, functioning as a space surveillance system part of the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Space Situational Awareness Programme]] (SSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Debris/Scanning_observing |title=ESA - Space Debris - Scanning &amp; observing|publisher=ESA|access-date=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1973, the EISCAT proposal&amp;nbsp;— which was originally planned for France, Germany and the three Nordic countries&amp;nbsp;— seemed moribund. Then, Welsh physicist [[Granville Beynon]] became involved and by 1975, the agreement was signed, with the UK as a member. The proposal for UK membership had originally been turned down by the appropriate SRC committee. Beynon, however, persuaded the Board to reverse the decision of the committee and as a result of his efforts, hundreds of European scientists have had the opportunity to use the world's most advanced ionospheric radar.&lt;ref name=mist /&gt;

In 2008, [[Doritos]] embarked upon an "out-of-this-world" advertising campaign, literally beaming a 30-second advertisement for Doritos brand tortilla chips into a solar system 42 light years away. This project is in collaboration with EISCAT Space Centre in [[Svalbard]]. The "You Make It, We'll Play It" contest chose the winning advertisement that was transmitted on June 12, 2008. The ad was beamed towards a distant star, within the Ursa Major constellation which is orbited by planets which may harbor life.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;

== EISCAT facilities==
[[Image:Ramfjordmoen forskningsstasjon winter 1.jpg|right|thumb|EISCAT Ramfjordmoen facility (near Tromsø) in winter]]
[[Image:EISCAT Sodankylä radar.JPG|right|thumb|EISCAT Sodankylä receiver antenna (diameter 32m) after conversion to 224 MHz (crossed dipole replaced Cassegrain subreflector at focal point)]]

EISCAT operates several facilities north of the [[Scandinavia]]n [[arctic circle]].&lt;ref name=eiscat-new&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eiscat.se/about/whatiseiscat_new| title=What is EISCAT| publisher=EISCAT| access-date=2015-05-23| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004043210/https://www.eiscat.se/about/whatiseiscat_new| archivedate=2015-10-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At Ramfjordmoen, near [[Tromsø]], Norway the EISCAT facility has: a [[Ionospheric heater]] with HF radar capabilities; a tristatic [[VHF]] radar at 224&amp;nbsp;MHz with a 4 x 30m-by-40m [[parabolic cylinder antenna]]; and a monostatic [[UHF]] radar at 931&amp;nbsp;MHz with a 32 m [[parabolic dish antenna]].&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eiscat.se/scientist/document/technical-specifications/| title=The EISCAT facilities| publisher=EISCAT| access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the start in 1981 the [[UHF]] radar was a steerable tristatic system, but due to interference from telecommunications in the 930 MHZ band, the remote receivers were converted to receive the VHF signal during 2012.
* At [[Kiruna]], EISCAT operates a 32 m parabolic dish antenna receiver which was originally part of the tristatic UHF system but was converted to receive the VHF frequency (224&amp;nbsp;MHz) during 2012.&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities /&gt;
* At [[Sodankylä]], Finland, EISCAT also operates a 32 m VHF-band parabolic dish antenna receiver working at 224&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities /&gt;
* At [[Longyearbyen]], on the Norwegian [[Svalbard]] archipelago, EISCAT operates the EISCAT Svalbard radar (ESR). It consists of a 32 m steerable parabolic dish antenna and a 42 m field aligned antenna, operating at 500&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=eiscat-new /&gt;&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities /&gt;

The Tromsø VHF transmitter, together with the Kiruna and Sodankylä VHF receivers, form a [[multistatic radar]] system.

Additionally, the [[KAIRA|Kilpisjärvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array]] (KAIRA), near [[Kilpisjärvi]], Finland can also serve as a VHF receiver in conjunction with the Tromsø transmitter.&lt;ref name=kira&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sgo.fi/KAIRA/| title=SGO: KAIRA| publisher=SGO| access-date=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EISCAT 3D==

EISCAT is planning on building a next generation radar capable of providing 3D monitoring of the atmosphere and ionosphere. The new system is called '''EISCAT_3D'''.

In 2008, the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures selected EISCAT_3D for its "Roadmap 2008 for Large-Scale European Research Infrastructures for the next 20–30 years."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiscat3d.se/idea "What is Eiscat 3D?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

EISCAT_3D will be a [[multistatic radar]] composed of five [[phased-array radar|phased-array]] antenna fields. each field will have around 10,000 crossed [[dipole antenna]] elements. All five sites will act as receivers, with a single core site transmitting at 233&amp;nbsp;MHz (VHF band). The sites will be spread over Finland, Norway and Sweden. Each site will have a central array, surrounded by a set of smaller arrays, providing a high spatial resolution via  [[aperture synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eiscat3d.se/status2015/configuration| title=EISCAT_3D System configuration| access-date=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparations for EISCAT_3D ===
During the summer of 2017, EISCAT will build a 91-element subarray at the site at Ramfjordmoen for hardware testing purposes and the full system is expected to be operational around 2021.
The [[KAIRA]] system is also a pathfinder for the development of EISCAT_3D.&lt;ref name=kira /&gt;

As of 2016, the majority of the [[electricity sector]] is privatized and foreign-owned (by both Russian and American companies), which is the result of a law passed in 1998 that allowed for the privatization of electricity generation and distribution in the country.

==  Installed capacity for electricity generation  ==
According to [[International Energy Agency]] in 2015 electricity generation in Armenia increased since 2009 to nearly 8000 GWh, but still remains below 1990 levels. Also, in 2015 Armenia consumed more than twice as much natural gas than in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/stats/WebGraphs/ARMENIA2.pdf|title=Electricity generation in Armenia 1990-2015 by source.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Armenia]] lacks fossil energy sources, and heavily relies on the production of electricity from a [[nuclear power plants|nuclear power plant]] and [[hydro power]] plants, and uses imported fossil fuels to operate [[thermal power]] plants. [[Solar energy]] and [[wind energy]] productions are just a small portion of the overall electricity production. 

Out of 3213.2 MW of installed capacity in [[Armenia]], the largest portion of electricity generation comes from [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] at 38%, 33% from [[hydro power]] plants, 22% from [[thermal power plants]], and the remaining 7% from other renewable sources.&lt;ref name="b" /&gt; Similar figures are derived from reports published by Electric Networks of Armenia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ena.am/aboutus.aspx?id=13&amp;lang=1|title=Տարեկան հաշվետվություններ|website=Electric Networks of Armenia|language=hy|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; - during the period of 01.01.2012 - 30.06.2017 breakdown of aggregated electricity supply was: [[Armenian Nuclear Power Plant|ANPP]] - 35.8%, all [[Hydro power plant|HPPs]] - 35.6%, all [[Thermal power station|TPPs]] - 28.5%. [[File:Meta-chart.png|thumb|450px|Electricity Generation&lt;ref name="b" /&gt;]]

The base loaded capacity is provided by the [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]], while the daily load regulation is provided by both the [[Sevan-Hrazdan Cascade]] and the [[Vorotan cascade]] hydropower plants. The aforementioned power plants are the primary domestic production energy sources while [[thermal power]] plants depend on imported gas.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electricity Production in Armenia|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2013/07/25/electricity-production-in-armenia/|website=TheArmenianWeekly|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}
== Nuclear power ==
{{main|Nuclear energy in Armenia}}
[[File:Metsamor nuclear power plant, cooling towers (Armenia, June 2015).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Cooling towers of the Metsamor NPP]]
Nuclear power provides 38% of the electricity in Armenia through one operating nuclear reactor, Unit 2 of [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]], which is a [[VVER|WWER-440]] reactor with extra seismic reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Power Plant Construction|url=https://jamestown.org/program/armenia-presses-ahead-with-nuclear-power-plant-construction/|website=JamesTown|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in 1976 and is the only nuclear power plant in the South Caucasus. However, after the [[Spitak earthquake]] in 1988, the nuclear power plant's operation was forced to stop,&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Energy Overview of the Republic of Armenia|url=http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/national_energy_grid/armenia/EnergyOverviewofArmenia.shtml|website=Global Energy Network Institute|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of the causes of the [[Armenian energy crisis of 1990's]]. The second unit of the NPP was restarted in October 1995, putting an end to the 'dark and cold years'.

Nuclear fuel must be flown in from Russia and then taken along a dirt road from [[Yerevan]] because Armenia's border with Turkey is closed. While the Republic of Armenia is the sole owner of the plant, the Russian company [https://web.archive.org/web/20081104080849/http://www.rao-ees.ru/en/ United Energy Systems] (UES) manages the Metsamor NPP.

A modernization of NPP is scheduled for 2018, which will enhance the safety and increase installed capacity by 40-50 MW. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Armenia also explores the possibilities of small modular reactor that would give flexibility and the opportunity to build a new nuclear power plant in a short time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/technology/modernization_to_increase_the_capacity_of_armenian_nuclear_power_plant_by_10/|title=Modernization to increase the capacity of Armenian nuclear power plant  by 10%|website=arka.am|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier it was reported that Armenia is looking for a new reactor with 1060 MW capacity in 2026.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Power in Armenia - World Nuclear Association|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/armenia.aspx|website=www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermal Power ==

=== History ===
From the 1960s, the [[USSR]] carried out an electricity generation plan with the intention of constructing thermal power plants in the southern regions of Armenia where fossil fuel energy resources were restricted. Construction of thermal power plants started in the energy-intensive regions of [[Armenia]]. The first power plant was constructed in [[Yerevan]] in 1960, which was followed by [[Vanadzor Thermal Power Plant]] in 1961, and [[Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heat Energy|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/543|website=Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of the Republic of Armenia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of energy for these power plants was natural gas which was delivered through pipelines running from [[Turkmenistan]] through [[Azerbaijan]]. Until the late 1980s, [[Armenia]] was heavily dependent on thermal and nuclear energy production. During the years of [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], the energy production of the thermal power plants was also stopped because of a border blockade, and [[Armenia]] had a severe energy crisis until the mid-1990s. However, [[Armenia]] managed to overcome this crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armenia Prepares Renewable Roadmap Amid Energy Crisis|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2013/07/armenia-prepares-renewable-roadmap-amid-energy-crisis.html|website=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the technology of some of the thermal power plants is outdated as of December 2016, a lot of upgrades and maintenance have been undertaken on the power plants. The [[Vanadzor Thermal Power Plant]] is not operational as of December 2016.&lt;ref name="b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

=== Current situation ===
There are two operational power plants as of December 2016: The [[Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant]] with an installed capacity of 1100 MW, and the [[Yerevan Thermal Power Plant]] with an installed capacity of 250 MW. The [[Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant]], which is owned by the [[Russian Federation]], produced 12.3% of the electricity produced in [[Armenia]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="b" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tashir Group to Acquire Hrazdan Power Plant in Armenia|url=http://asbarez.com/140476/tashir-group-to-acquire-hrazdan-power-plant-in-armenia/|website=Asbarez|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent upgrades made to the [[Yerevan Thermal Power Plant]] have increased its efficiency to almost 70% by reducing the consumption of fuel, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda, and by reducing emission levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Yerevan TPP" CJSC|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/531|website=Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of the Republic of Armenia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its power production, it uses natural gas supplied from [[Iran]] and exchanges it with the electricity produced by the plant, while using the surplus energy for domestic consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yerevan Thermal Power Plant, Armenia|url=http://www.power-technology.com/projects/yerevancombinedcylce/|website=Power Technology|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renewable Energy Resources and Installations==
Armenia does not possess large fossil energy resources like coal, gas, or oil. However, according to a report by the Danish Management Group, Armenia has a large potential for renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

|}

=== Hydro power ===
[[Hydro power]] plants provide 70 percent of Armenia’s renewable energy, and 33% of the country’s overall electricity production. Major HPP capacities are installed within [[Sevan-Hrazdan Cascade]] and [[Vorotan Cascade]].&lt;ref name="minenergy-hydro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/448|title=Hydro Energy|website=MINISTRY OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURES AND NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydropower potential of Armenia is reported to be 21.8 billion kWh.

As of the 1st of January, 2018 electricity was generated by 184 small HPPs, with total installed capacity of 353 MW.  In 2017 the generation of the electricity from small HPPs was around 862 million kW*h, which is about 11% of the total generated electricity in Armenia (7762 million kW*h). As of the 1st of January, 2018 and according to the provided licenses, 36 additional SHPPs are under construction, with about total projected 69 MW capacity and 250 million kW*h electricity annual supply. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/464|title=Hydro Energy - Investment projects - Projects - www.minenergy.am|website=www.minenergy.am|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accc.org.uk/small-hydro-power-plants-in-armenia/|title=Small Hydro Power Plants in Armenia|website=Armenian Community Council of the United Kingdom|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar energy ===
[[Solar energy]] potential in [[Armenia]] is 1000 MW according to researchers. The reason for this is that average [[solar radiation]] in Armenia is almost 1700 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/416|title=Solar Energy|website=Ministry of Energy of Armenia|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the solar technology is used only by some companies, and has no wide use among the citizens of Armenia. One of the well-known utilization examples is the [[American University of Armenia]] (AUA) which uses it not only for electricity generation, but also for water heating. The Government of Armenia is promoting utilization of solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/06/legislative-reform-to-promote-solar-energy-in-armenia.html|title=Legislative Reform to Promote Solar Energy in Armenia|website=RENEWABLE ENERGY WORLD|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inforse.org/europe/success/SU_S_AR.htm|title=Solar Heating and Cooling in Armenia|website=INFORSE-EUROPE|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018 an international consortium consisting of the Dutch and Spanish companies won the tender for the construction of a 55 MW solar power plant Masrik-1. The solar power station is planned to be built in the community of [[Mets Masrik]] of the [[Gegharkunik Province|Gegharkunik region]] entirely at the expense of foreign investments. The expected volume of investments in this generation facility will be about $ 50 million. Construction of the plant is expected to be completed by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://finport.am/full_news.php?id=34175&amp;lang=3|title=Solar power plant Masrik-1 to build a consortium of Dutch and Spanish companies {{!}} Finport.am|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wind power ===
[[File:Lori-1 wind farm 17.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Glance of [[Lori-1 Wind Farm]]]]
[[Wind]] is a rare means of acquiring energy in Armenia, but it can be profitable. According to the research conducted by [[NREL]] in 2003, the [[wind energy]] potential in Armenia is close to 450 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/465|title=ASSESSMENT OF WIND’S POTENTIAL IN THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA|website=Ministry of Energy of Armenia|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia's first wind power plant started operating in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/545|title=Wind Energy Programs in Armenia|website=Ministry of Energy of Armenia|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a wind farm with a total capacity of 2.6 MW built in Puskin pass. This wind farm includes four 660 KW wind turbines. The most promising areas for wind power plants are Zod pass, Bazum Mountain, Jajur pass, the territory of Geghama Mountains, Sevan Pass, [[Aparan]], the highlands between [[Sisian]] and [[Goris]], and the region of [[Meghri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://r2e2.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Wind-Potential-Report_Eng.pdf|title=WIND ENERGY IN ARMENIA: OVERVIEW OF POTENTIAL AND DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES|website=USAID|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioenergy ===
The [[bioenergy]] sphere is gradually developing in [[Armenia]]. There are three rudimentary branches of bio energy: [[biofuel]], [[biomass]] and [[biogas]]. Many scientists see the future of [[renewable energy]] of Armenia in bio energy.

The first is biofuel. As is accepted worldwide, the substantial sources of [[bio-ethanol]] are [[corn]] and [[sugarcane]]. Through these ingredients, bio ethanol is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bio-Ethanol Fuel Program for Armenia {{!}} Asbarez.com|url=http://asbarez.com/64999/a-bio-ethanol-fuel-program-for-armenia/|website=Asbarez.com|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the case of blending it 50-50 with [[oil]], the price will be cheaper than in ordinary cases. Thus, prices for transportation will decrease as well. The weather in Armenia is not appropriate for growing sugarcane, so the [[Jerusalem artichoke]] is considered to replace it. Moreover, its high concentration of [[carbohydrate]]s makes it a better source for bio-ethanol production. Another type of cheap biofuel is created by compressing [[straw]], [[sawdust]], and the pods of sunflowers in a crusher into [[granular material|granules]], which are then burned. It is feasible to receive 2 cubic meters (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of gas from the burning of 1 kilogram (kg) of those granules. Scientists believe this will give Armenia the opportunity to provide heat for houses and to produce electricity, which would not be dependent on gas pipes or oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production Of Cheap Biofuel|url=http://res-eff.tpu.ru/en/news/in-armenia-production-of-cheap-biofuel-was-arranged.html|website=Resource Effiсient Technologies|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aragat - Armenia (2928580481).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dry animal dung fuel in Armenia]]
The second one is biomass. Scientists share the opinion that Armenia has the most energy-diverse market in the [[Caucasus]]. The reason for this is that, in addition to gas and electricity used for heating, people from many towns and villages use biomass, such as wood and manure. Thus biomass pellets have large prospective as they burn cleaner, hotter, and are more conventional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heating Armenia the Sustainable Way|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2015/01/29/heating-armenia/|website=The Armenian Weekly|accessdate=9 December 2016|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lusakert.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lusakert Biogas Plant]]
Biogas yielded from manure can be a good source for generating both heat and electricity. An example of this in Armenia is [[Lusakert Biogas Plant]] in [[Nor Geghi]], Kotayk Marz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy in Armenia|url=http://hetq.am/static/content/pdf/Renewable_Energy_in_Armenia_9-17-11.pdf|website=Hetq.am|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lusakert Biogas Plant|url=http://www.energy-engineering.net/index.php/articles-2/10-news-events/72-presentation-lusakert-biogas-plant.html|website=www.energy-engineering.net|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in 2008, and is still working properly with a nominal capacity of 0.85 MW. After being built, the power plant won a National Energy Globe Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Energy Globe Award|url=http://www.energyglobe.info/awards/details/awdid/9485/|website=www.energyglobe.info|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

According to [[National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia|Armstat]] total final consumption of electric energy in 2016 amounted to 458.2 ktoe and was broken down as presented on the graph to the right.&lt;ref name="armstat2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://armstat.am/file/doc/99506908.pdf|title=Energy balance of the Republic of Armenia, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Armenia consumed 5352 GWh of the total 7956 GWh of electricity production (7750 GWh domestic production and 206 GWh imports). This is approximately 67.3% of the total. The biggest consumer was the residential sector (1924 GWh, ~24.2%).&lt;ref name="iea-cons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/statistics/statisticssearch/report/?country=Armenia&amp;product=electricityandheat|title=Armenia: Electricity and Heat for 2014|website=International Energy Agency|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Bank data referring to [[International Energy Agency]] demonstrates that in per capita terms electricity consumption in Armenia remains below world average and in 2014 only matched 1992 figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=eg_use_elec_kh_pc&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=eg_use_elec_kh_pc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ARM&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;tstart=635630400000&amp;tend=1393012800000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false|title=World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Nuclear Energy ===
Metsamor nuclear power plant provides more that 40 percent of power in Armenia; however, it is aging and will need to be replaced soon. It has received lots of financing for modernizing its systems and safety features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zmescience.com/ecology/environmental-issues/amernia-metsamor-nuclear-power-plant-hazard-to-world-14354523/|title=Armenia’s Metsamor nuclear power station – most dangerous in the world?|website=ZME Science|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia has extended a loan of $270 million and a $30 million grant for extending the lifetime of Metsamor NPP in 2015, which will be coming to an end in 2016. The funds are to be provided for 15 years with a 5-year grace period and an interest rate of annually 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/technology/psrc_to_consider_metsamor_nuclear_power_plant_s_2016_investment_program/|title=PSRC to consider Metsamor nuclear power plant's 2016 investment program|website=Arka News Agency|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for building a new nuclear power plant have been discussed. In July 2014, the energy minister of Russian Federation announced that Russia is willing to provide 4.5 billion USD out of 5 billion USD needed for construction of a new nuclear power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/armenia.aspx|title=Nuclear Power in Armenia|website=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the construction of a new power plant was approved by the Armenian government, which was to be started in 2018.

=== Hydro Energy ===
Hydro power is the most widely used renewable energy source in Armenia since Soviet times. Armenian government has proposed construction of four large and 30 small hydroelectric plants with a combined 300 MW capacity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

These include:

* Meghri HPP on [[Aras (river)|Araks River]] in [[Syunik Province]] (revised to about 100 MW capacity and around 800 million kWh; corresponding law enacted in Iran in 2017; earlier cost estimates run at $323 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arka.am/ru/news/economy/medzhlis_irana_utverdil_zakon_o_stroitelstve_ges_na_reke_araks/|title=Меджлис Ирана утвердил закон "О строительстве ГЭС на реке Аракс"|website=arka.am|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;), 
* Shnogh HPP on [[Debed|Debed River]] in [[Lori Province]] (about 75 MW capacity and 300 million kWh annual electricity generation) and 
* Loriberd HPP on [[Dzoraget River]] in [[Lori Province]] (about 66 MW capacity and 200 million kWh annual electricity generation) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects|url=http://www.minenergy.am/page/464|website=Ministry of Energy Infrastructure and Natural Resources of the Republic of Armenia|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cost of the project is at least 500 million USD and is currently proposed for investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydroelectic and Other Renewable Energy|url=http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/national_energy_grid/armenia/EnergyOverviewofArmenia.shtml|website=Global Energy Network Institute|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar Energy ===
[[Armenia]] also has a large solar energy potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/466|title=Solar Energy - Investment projects - Projects - www.minenergy.am|website=www.minenergy.am|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with other countries, the average annual energy flow is higher; therefore, there is large interest in this energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advantages of Solar Power in Armenia|url=http://shtigen.com/en/advantages-of-solar-power-in-armenia/|website=Energy Efficient Solutions|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2018 deputy minister of energy infrastructure and natural resources mentioned that the electricity market liberalization process began and a local production of solar panels kicked off.  He said that it is planned to make the solar energy share reach at least 10% in the energy sector by 2022.  314 solar power stations with up to 500 kW capacity are connected to the electricity network in Armenia, while 85 other solar power stations are in the stage of connection with a total capacity of 5.2 MW. 4 systemic solar stations are connected to the network, 7 are in the construction phase with completion planned within this year with the total capacity is 10 MW. Nearly 600 families are already using solar energy in non-gasified communities under state funded projects alone. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://armenpress.am/eng/news/932691.html|title=More than 300 solar power stations connected to Armenia’s electricity network, major projects underway|work=armenpress.am|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, a 58 million USD investment project was launched, which was designed to help the renewable energy sector. This project included plans for solar power stations of 40-50 MW capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=$58mln renewable energy project launched in Armenia|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/195235/|website=PanARMENIAN Network|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Wind Energy ===
The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] of [[United States]] has determined the wind potential of Armenia to be about 450 MW. According to the same source, the main prospective places for building wind farms are [[Zod Pass]], in [[Bazum Mountain]], in [[Jajur Pass]], in [[Gegham Mountains]], in [[Sevan Pass]], and in the highlands between [[Sisian]] and [[Goris]]. Monitoring in [[Qarahach pass]] was conducted by the Armenian-Italian private company “Ar Energy.” The company has a license to construct the “Qarahach 1” wind farm with an overall capacity of 20 MW, which will be expanded to 140 MW in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/page/465|title=Investment Projects|website=Ministry of Energy Infrastructure and Natural Resources of the Republic of Armenia|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is a project for construction of a wind power plant at [[Simyonovka Pass]] in Sevan with a cumulative capacity of 34 MW. The project is proposed for investment.

=== Geothermal Energy ===
As of 2018, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Armenia is considering the development of a [[Geothermal power|geothermal plant]] on the [[Jermaghbyur Geothermal Power Plant|Jermaghbyur]] and [[Karkar Geothermal Power Plant|Karkar]] sites in a package solution with a single investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-project-in-armenia-could-be-developed-by-single-investor/|title=Geothermal project in Armenia could be developed by single investor {{!}} Think GeoEnergy - Geothermal Energy News|website=www.thinkgeoenergy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/467|title=Geothermal Energy - Investment projects - Projects - www.minenergy.am|website=www.minenergy.am|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total cost of the geothermal power plant construction project at Karkar site is expected to make about $100 million. Karkar geothermal power plant with a capacity of 30 MW will generate around 250 million kWh of electricity in a year.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.construction.am/news/680-first-geothermal-power-plant-will-be-built-in-armenia/|title=The First Geothermal Power Plant Will Be Built in Armenia {{!}} News {{!}} Construction Portal Armenia|website=www.construction.am|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high pressure (20-25 atmosphere pressure) hot water (up to 250&amp;nbsp;°C) considered to be available in depth of 2500-3000 meters in Jermaghbyur is a potential source of geothermal energy with a capacity of 25 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/467|title=Geothermal Energy|website=Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of the Republic of Armenia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esmap.org/sites/esmap.org/files/DocumentLibrary/Armenia_Harutyunyan.pdf|title=Geothermal Energy Development in Armenia|website=R2E2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy Efficiency ===
In 2012, 1.82 million USD was invested by [[International Bank of Reconstruction and Development]] in an energy saving program. The program planned to upgrade the insulation of public buildings and heating systems, which included replacing traditional lamps with [[LED]]s, and installing solar water heating panels. On 30 June 2016 the project’s grant component had been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Efficiency|url=http://www.minenergy.am/page/521|website=Ministry of Energy Infrastructure and Natural Resources of the Republic of Armenia|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EnergyMap.dk''' is the national [[Denmark|Danish]] internet portal for [[energy]] and [[climate]] related solutions. 

EnergyMap provides information about Danish companies, organisations, institutions and public authorities, technologies and programmes that may help combat [[climate change]] and improve [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. Users may "study the solutions, cases, projects and events presented on the portal. Many of the featured sites are open for visitors and many" also offer [[R&amp;D]] information or investment opportunities.{{cn|date=November 2013}}

EnergyMap is a part of [[Climate Consortium Denmark]], a public-private partnership established in June 2008, by [[Folketing|The Danish Parliament]] and [[EnergyMap.dk#External_links|these Danish business organizations]]. The purpose of Climate Consortium Denmark is to showcase products and technologies within [[Cleantech]] and [[Clean technology]] held by Danish business and industry, as well as the knowledge in [[climate]]- and [[energy]]- technologies held by Danish universities and research institutions.

==History==
The purpose of EnergyMap is to showcase, create awareness and attract attention to climate-friendly products and technologies of Danish companies and knowledge institutions.

The idea of EnergyMap was born in the high-tech network for [[renewable energy]], VE-Net. VE-Net is supported by The Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation and is run by the Danish Technological Institute in cooperation with The Danish Energy Industries Federation. The latter is responsible for the development and operation of the internet platform. Ownership of EnergyMap has been passed to the Climate Consortium.

The '''Energy Identification Code''' or EIC is a 16-character code used in Europe to uniquely identify entities and objects related to the electricity and gas sector.

The EIC code is used for:
* Transmission System Operators, Market Participants etc.;
* Transmission lines and Metering points;
* Bidding Zones, Control Areas, Market Balance Areas etc.;
* Substations, Generation units and [[Power plant]]s

The EIC codes are used -among others- in the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform and in the ARIS platform, both supporting EU regulations on transparency and integrity.

==Actors involved in the EIC coding scheme==
The scheme is supported by a central issuing office (“CIO”, function exercised by ENTSO-E for both the electricity and the gas sectors) and ENTSO-E-authorised local issuing offices (LIOs) in Europe.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2016}}

In [[physics]], '''exotic matter''' is [[matter]] that somehow deviates from normal matter and has "exotic" properties. A broader definition of exotic matter is any kind of non-baryonic matter—that is not made of [[baryons]], the subatomic particles (such as [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]) of which ordinary matter is composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/exotic_matter.html|title=Exotic matter|publisher=[[daviddarling.info]]|accessdate=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exotic mass has been considered a colloquial term for matters such as [[dark matter]], [[negative mass]], or [[Mass#Tachyonic particles and imaginary (complex) mass|complex mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4517897/nobel-prize-physics-2016/|title=Why 'Exotic Matter' Matters—and Won the Nobel Prize in Physics|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4517897/nobel-prize-physics-2016/|title=Why 'Exotic Matter' Matters—and Won the Nobel Prize in Physics|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/science/356829/physicists-confirm-existence-of-new-exotic-matter/story/|title=Physicists confirm existence of new 'exotic' matter|work=GMA News Online|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/8012-exotic-antimatter-created-earth.html|title=Exotic Antimatter Created on Earth|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/supplements/insights/exoticmatter/index.html|title=Exotic matter  : Insight : Nature|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anonymous|date=1998-08-03|title=Focus: Wormhole Construction: Proceed with Caution|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v2/st7|journal=Physics|language=en-US|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of exotic matter==
There are several types of exotic matter:

== Negative mass ==
{{main article|Negative mass}}

Negative mass would possess some strange properties, such as accelerating in the direction opposite of applied [[force]]. Despite being inconsistent with the expected behavior of "normal" matter, negative mass is mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of [[conservation of momentum]] or [[conservation of energy|energy]]. It is used in certain speculative theories, such as on the construction of artificial [[wormhole]]s and the [[Alcubierre drive]]. The closest known real representative of such exotic matter is the region of pseudo-[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] density produced by the [[Casimir effect]].

According to [[mass–energy equivalence]], mass  &lt;math&gt;m &lt;/math&gt; is in proportion to energy  &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and the coefficient of proportionality is &lt;math&gt;c^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Actually,  &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is still equivalent to  &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; although the coefficient is another constant &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wang, Z.Y |author2=Wang P.Y |author3=Xu Y.R | date=2011 | title=Crucial experiment to resolve Abraham-Minkowski Controversy | journal=Optik | volume=122 | pages=1994–1996 | doi=10.1016/j.ijleo.2010.12.018 | issue= 22|bibcode = 2011Optik.122.1994W |arxiv=1103.3559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as &lt;math&gt;-c^2 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, Z.Y.|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503–508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is unnecessary to introduce a [[negative energy]] because the mass can be negative although the energy is positive. That is to say,

:&lt;math&gt;E=-mc^2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m= -\frac{E}{c^2}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

Under the circumstances，

:&lt;math&gt;dE=Fds=\frac{dp}{dt}ds=\frac{ds}{dt}dp=vdp=vd(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-c^2dm=vd(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-c^2(2m)dm=2mvd(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-c^2d(m^2)=d(m^2v^2)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-m^2c^2=m^2v^2+C&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;C=-m_0^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt;-m^2c^2=m^2v^2-m_0^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m={m_0\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; is [[invariant mass]] and [[invariant energy]] equals &lt;math&gt;E_0=-m_0 c^2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  The squared mass is still positive and the particle can be stable.

Since &lt;math&gt;m= {m_0\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;p=mv= {m_0 v\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

The [[negative momentum]] is applied to explain [[negative refraction]], [[inverse Doppler effect]] and [[reverse Cherenkov effect]] observed in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The [[radiation pressure]] in the [[metamaterial]] is also negative&lt;ref name="Veselago1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veselago|first=V. G.|title=The electrodynamics of substances with simultaneously negative values of permittivity and permeability|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|year=1968|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514 |doi=10.1070/PU1968v010n04ABEH003699|bibcode = 1968SvPhU..10..509V }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the force is defined as &lt;math&gt;F=\frac{dp}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. [[Pressure#Negative pressures|Negative pressure]] exists in [[dark energy]] too. Using these above equations, the [[energy-momentum relation]] should be

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the [[Planck-Einstein relation]] &lt;math&gt;E=\hbar\omega&lt;/math&gt; and [[de Broglie]]'s &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the following [[dispersion relation]] 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 =- k^2c^2+ \omega_p^2&lt;/math&gt;,    &lt;math&gt;(E_0=\hbar\omega_p=-m_0c^2&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt;

of the wave consists of a stream of particles whose [[energy-momentum relation]] is &lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;([[wave–particle duality]]) can be excited in a [[negative index metamaterial]].The velocity of such a particle is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;v=c\sqrt{\frac{E_0^2}{E^2}-1}=c\sqrt{\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

and range is from zero to infinity

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}&lt;2&lt;/math&gt;,      &lt;math&gt;v&lt;c&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;,      &lt;math&gt;v&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the [[kinetic energy]] is also negative

:&lt;math&gt;E_k = E-E_0=-mc^2-(-m_0 c^2)=-{m_0c^2\over\sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}} + m_0 c^2= m_0 c^2 (1-{1\over\sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}})&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;(m_0&lt;0)&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, the [[negative kinetic energy]] exists in some models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Caldwell, R.R.|title=A phantom menace? Cosmological consequences of a dark energy component with super-negative equation of state|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=545|pages=23–29|date=2002|doi=10.1016/S0370-2693(02)02589-3|issue=1–2|arxiv = astro-ph/9908168 |bibcode = 2002PhLB..545...23C }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe [[dark energy]] ([[phantom energy]]) whose pressure is negative. In this way, the [[negative mass]] of exotic matter is now associated with [[negative momentum]], [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]], negative kinetic energy and FTL ([[faster-than-light]]).

== Complex mass ==
{{Main article|Tachyon#Mass}}

A hypothetical particle with [[Complex number|complex]] rest mass would always travel faster than the [[speed of light]]. Such particles are called [[tachyon]]s. There is no confirmed existence of tachyons.

: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m\cdot c^2}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{\left|\mathbf{v}\right|^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

If the rest mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is complex this implies that the denominator is complex because the total energy is [[observable]] and thus must be [[real number|real]]. Therefore, the quantity under the square root must be negative, which can only happen if [[speed|''v'']] is greater than [[speed of light|''c'']]. As noted by [[Gregory Benford]] ''et al.,'' [[special relativity]] implies that tachyons, if they existed, could be used to communicate backwards in time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G. A. Benford |author2=D. L. Book |author3=W. A. Newcomb |year=1970|title=The Tachyonic Antitelephone|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=2 |page=263|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.2.263|bibcode = 1970PhRvD...2..263B }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[tachyonic antitelephone]]). Because [[time travel]] is considered to be non-physical, tachyons are believed by physicists either not to exist, or else to be incapable of interacting with normal matter.

In quantum field theory, complex mass would induce [[tachyon condensation]].

== Materials at high pressure ==
At high pressure, materials such as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) in the presence of an excess of either chlorine or sodium were transformed into compounds "forbidden" by classical chemistry, such as {{chem|Na|3|Cl}} and {{chem|Na|Cl|3}}. Quantum mechanical calculations predict the possibility of other compounds, such as {{chem|Na|Cl|7}}, {{chem|Na|3|Cl|2}} and {{chem|Na|2|Cl}}. The materials are thermodynamically stable at high pressures. Such compounds may exist in natural environments that exist at high pressure, such as the deep ocean or inside planetary cores. The materials have potentially useful properties. For instance, {{chem|Na|3|Cl}} is a two-dimensional metal, made of layers of pure sodium and salt that can conduct electricity. The salt layers act as insulators while the sodium layers act as conductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/scientists-create-forbidden-compounds-table-salt/30520/ |title=Scientists turn table salt into forbidden compounds that violate textbook rules |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = W. | last2 = Oganov | first2 = A.

'''F-1''' is a [[CubeSat|1U CubeSat]] built by FSpace laboratory at [[FPT University]] in Vietnam, in partnership with [http://www.astc.uu.se Angstrom Space Technology Center (ASTC)], [[Uppsala University]] and [[NanoRacks]] LLC.  Its mission is to train young engineers and students about aerospace engineering and evaluate an advanced 3-axis magnetometer (SDTM) designed in [[Sweden]] by [http://www.astc.uu.se ASTC].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/f-1.htm |title=F-1| publisher=Gunter's Space Page| author= Gunter Dirk Krebs | date= July 21, 2012 | accessdate= July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

F-1 was launched on 21 July 2012 and delivered to [[International Space Station]] (ISS) aboard [[Kounotori 3]] along with the [[Raiko]], [[We-Wish|We Wish]], [[Niwaka]] and [[TechEdSat]] cubesats.

The '''Galaxy Evolution Explorer''' ('''GALEX''') is an [[orbit]]ing [[ultraviolet]] [[space telescope]] launched on April 28, 2003, and operated until early 2012.

==History==
An airlaunched [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]] rocket placed the craft into a nearly circular orbit at an [[altitude]] of {{convert|697|km}} and an [[inclination]] to the [[Earth]]'s equator of 29 degrees.

The [[First light (astronomy)|first observation]] was dedicated to the crew of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]], being images in the [[constellation]] [[Hercules (astronomy)|Hercules]] taken on May 21, 2003. This region was selected because it had been directly overhead the shuttle at the time of its last contact with the [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|NASA Mission Control Center]].

After its primary mission of 29 months, observation operations were extended to almost 9 years with NASA placing it into standby mode on 7 Feb 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/93409/galex-mission-comes-to-an-end/ GALEX ends]&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA cut off financial support for operations of GALEX in early February 2011 as it was ranked lower than other projects which were seeking a limited supply of funding. The mission's life-cycle cost to NASA was $150.6 million. The [[California Institute of Technology]] negotiated to transfer control of GALEX and its associated ground control equipment to the California Institute of Technology in keeping with the [[Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980|Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act]]. Under this Act, excess research equipment owned by the US government can be transferred to educational institutions and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Stephen Clark |title=NASA, Caltech mull over unique satellite donation |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1202/10galex/ |work=Spaceflight Now |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, GALEX operations were transferred to Caltech.&lt;ref name=woo&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2012-05-nasa-ultraviolet-space-telescope-caltech.html Marcus Woo - NASA lends ultraviolet space telescope to Caltech (May 17, 2012) - Phys.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2013 NASA decommissioned GALEX.  It is expected that the spacecraft will remain in orbit for at least 65 years before it will re-enter the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galex.caltech.edu/newsroom/glx2013-03r.html NASA Decommissions Its Galaxy Hunter Spacecraft]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science mission==
[[File:GALEX Field of View.jpg|thumb|left|GALEX field of view compared to a full Moon]]

During its initial 29-month mission, which was extended, it made observations in [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths to measure the history of [[star]] formation in the [[universe]] 80 percent of the way back to the [[Big Bang]]. Since scientists believe the Universe to be about 13.8 billion years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Cosmic Detectives |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Cosmic_detectives |authorlink= |work= |publisher=The European Space Agency (ESA) |date=2013-04-02 |doi= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt; the mission will study [[galaxy|galaxies]] and stars across about 10 billion years of cosmic history.

The [[space observatory|spacecraft's]] mission is to observe hundreds of thousands of [[galaxy|galaxies]], with the goal of determining the distance of each galaxy from Earth and the rate of [[star formation]] in each galaxy.  Near- and far-UV emissions as measured by GALEX can indicate the presence of young stars, but may also originate from old stellar populations (e.g. [[sdB stars]]).

Partnering with the NASA [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) on the mission are the [[California Institute of Technology]], [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]], [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Yonsei University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, France]].

The observatory participated in GOALS with Spitzer, Chandra, and Hubble.&lt;ref name=goals&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4498 GOALS: The Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; GOALS stands for ''Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey'', and [[Luminous Infrared Galaxies]] were studied at the multiple wavelengths allowed by the telescopes.&lt;ref name=goals/&gt;

==Specifications==
The telescope has a 50&amp;nbsp;cm diameter aperture primary, in a Richey-Chretien f/6 configuration.&lt;ref name=astro&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/galex.htm Encyclopedia Astronautica - GALEX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706050843/http://astronautix.com/craft/galex.htm |date=2008-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can see light wavelengths from 135 nanometers to 280&amp;nbsp;nm,&lt;ref name=astro/&gt; with a field of view of 1.2 degrees wide&lt;ref name=astro/&gt; (larger than a full moon). It has gallium-arsenide solar cells which supply nearly 300 watts to the spacecraft.&lt;ref name=astro/&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Boston, Lincolnshire]], Southern was educated at [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|Wyggeston Grammar School]], [[Leicester]] where his interest in studying birds started.  He went up to [[Queen’s College, Oxford]] in 1927.  He studied first classics, supported by an open foundation scholarship, and then a second undergraduate degree in zoology, with a four-year gap spent working for the publishers [[Ward Lock]].

After graduating for the second time he joined the Bureau of Animal Population at Oxford as a research scientist investigating a new technique for studying rabbits, funded by a Browne Research Scholarship.  During [[World War II]], Southern transferred to work on the control of pests, in particular the house mouse, as part of work the Animal Population Bureau took on for the Agricultural Research Council.  In 1946 the Department of Zoological Field Studies in Oxford was formed from the Animal Population Bureau and the [[Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology]] and Mick Southern was made a Senior Research Officer.  In this post he conducted a long-term (15 year) population study of the predator-prey relationships between wood-mice and bank voles, and one of their predators, the Tawny Owl.  He edited ''The Handbook of British Mammals'' (1964), the journal ''Bird Study'' (1954–60) and the ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' (1968–75). He was awarded a D.Sc. from Oxford in 1972.

'''Inertia negation''' is a hypothetical process causing physical objects with [[mass]] to act as if they were of lower mass or were massless. The effect is the opposite of adding [[ballast]]. No such process is known to exist in the real world: if current understanding of physics is correct, such a process would be impossible. There is currently no known material or technology that is able to eliminate or negate the effects of [[inertia]] that all objects with mass possess.

==Overview==
According to [[Newton's first law]], "A body will continue in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless compelled to change that state by a net force." [[Inertia]] is the resistance against changes in the motion of an object. Objects within objects each possess their own inertia, and will collide with each other when the containing object is moved.

A device that would be capable of inertia negation is described as being capable of reducing the inertia of both the larger containing object, and of all contained objects within, so as to make changes in motion easier, and to reduce or prevent damage due to internal collisions. The inertia is not absorbed or redirected but simply ceases to have a physical effect.

[[Antimatter]], while being the opposite of [[matter]], has the same kind of inertia, with the forces oriented in the same direction, as normal matter. Thus, storing antimatter on board a vehicle made of matter would not achieve any kind of inertia negation.

== Inertia negation in fiction ==

Inertia negation is a commonplace technology in numerous [[science fiction]] series. It is used as an explanation as to why the crew of starships can withstand complex maneuvres or acceleration to [[Faster-than-light|FTL]] speeds.

Notable appearances include the [[Star Trek]] franchise, where inertial dampers protect the crew from the dangers of sudden accelerations. Another example is in the movie [[Alien (film)|Alien]].

In the fictional [[Mass Effect]] universe [[dark energy]] fields are used ubiquitously to modify mass of objects, e.g. of weapon projectiles to allow use of compact mass accelerators in order to achieve higher muzzle velocity, or even negate the mass of entire spaceships in order to enable FTL travel.

=== Inertial damper as shock absorber ===
Inertia negation is used to counter the effects of sudden acceleration that would impart structural stresses on star ships when suddenly accelerating to or decelerating with the [[impulse drive]], and which would cause passengers to be thrown against walls and crushed by the inertial effects of the vehicle suddenly accelerating or slowing.

Such a device does not need to negate or alter inertia – a similar effect can be achieved by creating a gravitational field opposing the acceleration of the vessel. Such technology, while still nonexistent at the present time and considered unlikely to be achieved in the foreseeable future, is by far more realistic than manipulating inertial mass.

A '''karst spring'''&lt;ref&gt;Whittow, John (1984). ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''. London: Penguin, 1984, p. 291. {{ISBN|0-14-051094-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] that is part of a [[karst]] system. That includes the underground drainage of a much larger area, which means that karst springs often have a very large [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]. Because of their often conical or bowl  shape, such water sources are also known in German-speaking lands as a ''Topf'' ("pot") which is reflected in names such as [[Aachtopf]] (the source of the [[Radolfzeller Aach]]) or [[Blautopf]] (the source of the [[Blau (river)|Blau river]] in [[Blaubeuren]]).

Karst springs are usually the end of a [[cave]] system at the place where a [[river cave]] reaches the Earth's surface. Thus, it is often possible to enter the caves at a karst spring and explore them.  Large karst springs are located in many parts of the world.  The world's largest karst springs are believed to be in [[Papua New Guinea]], with others located in [[Mediterranean]] countries including [[Bosnia]], [[Turkey]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Ford2013"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whgNDVXFiqYC&amp;dq=tobio+spring+new+guinea&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Karst Hydrogeology and Geomorphology |first1=Derek |last1=Ford |first2=Paul D. |last2=Williams |year=2013 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''[[estavelle]]''' or '''inversac''' is a ground orifice which, depending on weather conditions and season, can serve either as a sink or as a source of fresh water. It is a type of  [[sinkhole]].&lt;ref name="LaMoreaux2001"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.si/books?id=sjEoBmfUka0C&amp;pg=PA57 |chapter=Geologic/Hydrogeologic Setting and Classification of Springs |page=57 |title=Springs and Bottled Waters of the World: Ancient History, Source, Occurrence, Quality and Use |first=Philip |last=Elmer LaMoreaux |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-61841-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Vauclusian spring''' is a spring that originates from a shaft or a cave system, with the water surging upwards under relatively high pressure. It is named after the [[Vaucluse|Fontaine de Vaucluse]] in southern France.&lt;ref name="LaMoreaux2001" /&gt;

Submarine karst springs, also known as {{lang|hr|'''vruljas'''}}, occur worldwide, and are most numerous in shallow waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name="LaMoreaux2001" /&gt;

== Hydrological features ==
The main feature of karst springs results from the fact that water is rapidly transported by underground caverns. This means that there is minimal filtering of the water and little separation of different sediments. Groundwater emerges at the spring within a few days. Storms, snowmelt, and general seasonal changes in rainfall have a very noticeable and rapid effect on karst springs.

Many karst springs dry up during the driest part of the year and are thus known as '''intermittent springs'''. Still others are dry most of the year round and only flow after heavy rain. Sources that only flow during wet years are often known in German as ''Hungerbrunnen'' ("hunger springs"), the reason being that folklore sees a connection between the flow rate of a spring and poor yield in a wet year. It is however more of a culturally related [[superstition]]. Scientific studies on various ''Hungerbrunnen'' have not confirmed such a relationship. An example is the ''Hungerbrunnen'' in the parish of Heuchlingen near [[Gerstetten#The Hungerbrunnental|Gerstetten]].

The properties of karst springs make them unsuitable for the supply of [[drinking water]]. Their uneven flow rate does not support steady rates of consumption, especially in summer when there is lower discharge but higher demand. In addition, poor filtering and high [[Water hardness|hardness]] mean that the water quality is poor. For these reasons, karst springs are nowadays rarely used for drinking water.

==Cultural references==
The French [[Realism (art movement)|Realist]] painter [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819-1877) painted a number of karst springs among many landscapes he depicted in the [[Jura (department)|Jura]] region of eastern France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fumey|first1=G.|title=Courbet, peintre du calcaire.|journal=Karstologia|date=2007|volume=50|pages=49-51|url=http://speleogenesis-info.isth.info/directory/karstbase/publication.php?id=3606|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lacus Excellentiae''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Lake of Excellence") is a relatively small, irregular [[lunar mare]] in the southern latitudes of the [[Moon]], amidst the rugged terrain to the south of the larger [[Mare Humorum]]. The most prominent feature within the diameter of this basin is the small crater [[Clausius (crater)|Clausius]].

The [[selenographic coordinates]] of this feature are {{coord|35.4|S|44.0|W|globe:Moon}} and it lies within a diameter of 184&amp;nbsp;km. The name of this lunar lake is a relatively recent addition to lunar nomenclature, being officially approved in 1976 by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU General Assembly]].

The ''Lacus Excellentiae'' was the impact site of the [[SMART-1]] lunar orbiter. This probe impacted the lunar surface on September 3, 2006 and was observed by [[astronomer]]s to determine the properties of the ejected materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5309656.stm | work=BBC News | title=Probe crashes into Moon's surface | date=2006-09-03 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Libertad 1''' ({{lang-en|Freedom 1}}) is a single [[CubeSat]] built by the Space Program of the [[Sergio Arboleda University]] in [[Colombia]]. It was launched aboard a [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr rocket]] on April 17, 2007 from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], [[Kazakhstan]] and became the first Colombian satellite to orbit the Earth. It used a telemetric payload to keep it in communication with the University. It was expected to have a 50-day lifespan, however news reports two years after it was launched stated the satellite was still working and sending information, passing over Colombia twice a day.

The '''list of Florida hurricanes''' from 2000 to the present has been marked by several devastating [[North Atlantic hurricane]]s; as of 2017, 79&amp;nbsp;[[tropical cyclone|tropical]] or [[subtropical cyclone]]s have affected the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]]. Collectively, cyclones in Florida during the time period resulted in more than $123&amp;nbsp;billion in damage (2017&amp;nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]). Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were responsible for 145&amp;nbsp;direct fatalities and at least 92&amp;nbsp;indirect casualties during the period. Eight cyclones affected the state in both [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004]] and [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], which were the years with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state. Every year included at least one tropical cyclone affecting the state. During the 2004 season, more than one out of every five houses in the state received damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2005|title=Climate of September 2004|accessdate=March 14, 2008|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2004/sep/hazards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Wilma in 2005, it would be 11 years until [[Hurricane Hermine|another hurricane]] would strike the state, and 12 years until [[Hurricane Irma|another major hurricane]] would strike the state.

The strongest hurricane to hit the state during the time period was [[Hurricane Michael]], which was the strongest hurricane to strike the contiguous United States since [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Additionally, hurricanes [[Hurricane Charley|Charley]], [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]], [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]], [[Hurricane Dennis|Dennis]], [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]], [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]], and [[Hurricane Michael|Michael]] made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the state as [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricanes]].

There is significant disagreement over the number of true [[rose]] species.  Some species are so similar that they could easily be considered variations of a single species, while other species show enough variation that they could easily be considered to be different species.  Lists of rose species usually show more than 360.&lt;ref name="TPL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/1.1/browse/A/Rosaceae/Rosa/|title=''Rosa''|publisher=[[The Plant List]].

== Subgenera and sections ==
[[File:Rosa banksiae var. lutea 3.JPG|thumb|''[[Rosa banksiae]]'']]
[[File:Rosa persica; Baikonur 01.jpg|thumb|''[[Rosa persica]]'']]
The genus ''Rosa'' is subdivided into four subgenera:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60824">Several features cover the [[geology of the Moon|surface]] of the [[Moon]]. These are listed below.

==Valleys==
Among many lunar features are several large [[valley]]s that have been given names.
Most of these valleys are named after a nearby [[impact crater|crater]]; see the [[list of craters on the Moon]] for more information.

This is a list of ''[[lunar mare|maria]]'' (singular ''mare'') on the [[Moon]]. Lunar Maria are the large, dark, regions of the moon. They do not actually contain any water, however they are believed to have been formed from molten rock from the moon's mantle coming out onto the surface of the moon. It also includes the one ''oceanus'' and the features known by the names ''lacus'', ''palus'' and ''sinus''. The modern system of lunar nomenclature was introduced in 1651 by [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Riccioli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Moore| first = Patrick | title = The Guinness book of astronomy facts and feats | publisher = Guinness Superlatives Ltd | location = Enfield, Middlesex | date = 1983 | page = 25 | doi = | isbn = 0-85112-258-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Riccioli's map of the moon was drawn by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], who has a crater named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencesource.com/archive/Riccioli-s-Moon-map--1651-SS2345420.html|title=Science Source - Riccioli's Moon map, 1651|website=www.sciencesource.com|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources also list a ''Palus Nebularum'' ("Marsh of Mists") at 38.0° N, 1.0° E. However the designation for this feature has not been officially recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]].

==Mountains==
These are isolated mountains or [[massif]]s.

Note that the heights listed below are not consistent across sources. In the 1960s, the US Army Mapping Service used elevation relative to 1,737,988 meters from the center of the Moon. In the 1970s, the US Defense Mapping Agency used 1,730,000 meters. The [[Clementine mission|Clementine]] topographic data published in the 1990s uses 1,737,400 meters.

Also note that this table is not comprehensive, and does not list the highest places on the Moon. Clementine data show a range of about 18,100 meters from lowest to highest point on the Moon. [[Selenean summit|The highest point]], located on the far side of the Moon, is approximately 6500 meters higher than Mons Huygens (usually listed as the tallest mountain).

===Terra&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of Highlands on the Moon]] --&gt;===

The continental areas between the seas were given comparable names by [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lpod.org/?m=20060418| date=April 18, 2006| title=Restoring Bright Names| work=LPOD lunar photo of the day| accessdate=2006-12-02| first=Chuck| last=Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were opposite the names used for the seas. Thus there were the lands of sterility (Terra Sterilitatis), heat (Terra Caloris), and liveliness (Terra Vitae). However these names for the highland regions are no longer used on recent maps, and ''Terrae'' are not officially recognized as standard lunar nomenclature by the [[International Astronomical Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The concept of '''[[mass]] in [[general relativity]]''' (GR) is more complex than the concept of [[mass in special relativity]]. In fact, general relativity does not offer a single definition of the term mass, but offers several different definitions that are applicable under different circumstances. Under some circumstances, the mass of a system in general relativity may not even be defined.

== Review of mass in special relativity ==
{{main | Mass in special relativity}}

In [[special relativity]], the [[invariant mass]] or ''rest mass'' (''hereafter simply "mass"'') of an [[isolated system]] can be defined in terms of the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of the system by the [[relativistic energy–momentum equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - \left(p c\right)^2}}{c^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the total energy of the system, ''p'' is the total momentum of the system and ''c'' is the speed of light. Concisely, in fundamental units where &lt;math&gt;c = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the mass of a system in special relativity is the norm of its energy–momentum [[four vector]]; otherwise, it is &lt;math&gt;mc&lt;/math&gt;.

==Defining mass in general relativity: concepts and obstacles==

Generalizing this definition to general relativity, however, is problematic; in fact, it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason for this is that "gravitational field energy" is not a part of the energy–momentum tensor; instead, what might be identified as the contribution of the gravitational field to a total energy is part of the Einstein tensor on the other side of Einstein's equation (and, as such, a consequence of these equations' non-linearity).  While  in certain situations it is possible to rewrite the equations so that part of the "gravitational energy" now stands alongside the other source terms in the form of the [[stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor]], this separation is not true for all observers, and there is no general definition for obtaining it.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=§20.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How, then, does one define a concept as a system's total mass – which is easily defined in classical mechanics?  As it turns out, at least for spacetimes which are [[Asymptotically flat spacetime|asymptotically flat]] (roughly speaking, which represent some isolated gravitating system in otherwise empty and gravity-free infinite space), the [[ADM formalism|ADM]] 3+1 split leads to a solution: as in the usual [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formalism]], the time direction used in that split has an associated energy, which can be integrated up to yield a global quantity known as the [[ADM formalism#ADM energy and mass|ADM mass]] (or, equivalently, ADM energy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arnowitt|Deser|Misner|1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, there is a possibility to define mass for a [[stationary spacetime|spacetime that is stationary]], in other words, one that has a time-like [[Killing vector field]] (which, as a generating field for time, is canonically conjugate to energy); the result is the so-called [[Komar mass]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{Harvnb|Komar|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wald.11.2"&gt;For a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although defined in a totally different way, it can be shown to be equivalent to the ADM mass for stationary spacetimes.&lt;ref&gt;This is shown in {{Harvnb|Ashtekar|Magnon-Ashtekar|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Komar integral definition can also be generalized to non-stationary fields for which there is at least an asymptotic [[time translation symmetry]]; imposing a certain gauge condition, one can define the [[Mass in general relativity#ADM and Bondi masses in asymptotically flat space-times|Bondi energy]] at null infinity.  In a way, the [[ADM formalism#ADM energy and mass|ADM energy]] measures all of the energy contained in spacetime, while the Bondi energy excludes those parts carried off by gravitational waves to infinity.&lt;ref name="Wald.11.2"/&gt;  Great effort has been expended on proving positivity theorems for the masses just defined, not least because positivity, or at least the existence of a lower limit, has a bearing on the more fundamental question of boundedness from below: if there were no lower limit to the energy, then no isolated system would be absolutely stable; there would always be the possibility of a decay to a state of even lower total energy.  Several kinds of proofs that both the ADM mass and the Bondi mass are indeed positive exist; in particular, this means that [[Minkowski space]] (for which both are zero) is indeed stable.&lt;ref&gt;See the various references given on p. 295 of {{Harvnb|Wald|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the focus here has been on energy, analogue definitions for global momentum exist; given a field of angular Killing vectors and following the Komar technique, one can also define global angular momentum.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The disadvantage of all the definitions mentioned so far is that they are defined only at (null or spatial) infinity; since the 1970s, physicists and mathematicians have worked on the more ambitious endeavor of defining suitable ''quasi-local'' quantities, such as the mass of an isolated system defined using only quantities defined within a finite region of space containing that system.  However, while there is a variety of proposed definitions such as the [[Hawking energy]], the [[Geroch energy]] or [[Roger Penrose|Penrose's]] quasi-local energy–momentum based on [[Twistor theory|twistor]] methods, the field is still in flux.  Eventually, the hope is to use a suitable defined quasi-local mass to give a more precise formulation of the [[hoop conjecture]], prove the so-called [[Penrose inequality]] for black holes (relating the black hole's mass to the horizon area) and find a quasi-local version of the laws of black hole mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;See the review article {{Harvnb|Szabados|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of mass in general relativity ==
{{Refimprove|date=February 2016}}

===Komar mass in stationary spacetimes ===
{{main | Komar mass}}

A non-technical definition of a [[stationary spacetime]] is a spacetime where none of the metric coefficients &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time.  The [[Schwarzschild metric]] of a [[black hole]] and the [[Kerr metric]] of a [[rotating black hole]] are common examples of stationary spacetimes.

By definition, a stationary spacetime exhibits [[time translation symmetry]].  This is technically called a time-like [[Killing vector]].  Because the system has a time translation symmetry, Noether's theorem guarantees that it has a conserved energy.  Because a stationary system also has a well defined rest frame in which its momentum can be considered to be zero, defining the energy of the system also defines its mass.  In general relativity, this mass is called the Komar mass of the system.  Komar mass can only be defined for stationary systems.

Komar mass can also be defined by a flux integral.  This is similar to the way that [[Gauss's law]] defines the charge enclosed by a surface as the normal electric force multiplied by the area.  The flux integral used to define Komar mass is slightly different from that used to define the electric field, however - the normal force is not the actual force, but the "force at infinity".  See the [[Komar mass|main article]] for more detail.

Of the two definitions, the description of Komar mass in terms of a time translation symmetry provides the deepest insight.

===ADM and Bondi masses in asymptotically flat space-times===
&lt;!-- There is a link to this section from General relativity, section "Consequences of Einstein's theory", subsection "Global and quasi-local quantities".  Please do not change the title of this section or the link will be broken. --&gt;

If a system containing gravitational sources is surrounded by an infinite vacuum region, the geometry of the space-time will tend to approach the flat [[Minkowski geometry]] of special relativity at infinity. Such space-times are known as "asymptotically flat" space-times.

For systems in which space-time is [[asymptotically flat]], the [[ADM mass|ADM]] and Bondi energy, momentum, and mass can be defined.  In terms of Noether's theorem, the ADM energy, momentum, and mass are defined by the asymptotic symmetries at [[conformal infinity|spatial infinity]], and the Bondi energy, momentum, and mass are defined by the asymptotic symmetries at [[conformal infinity|null infinity]].  Note that mass is computed as the length of the energy–momentum [[four vector]], which can be thought of as the energy and momentum of the system "at infinity".

===The Newtonian limit for nearly flat space-times===
In the Newtonian limit, for quasi-static systems in nearly flat space-times, one can approximate the total energy of the system by adding together the non-gravitational components of the energy of the system and then subtracting the ''Newtonian'' gravitational binding energy.

Translating the above statement into the language of general relativity, we say that a system in nearly flat space-time has a total non-gravitational energy E and momentum P given by:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \int_v T_{00} dV \qquad P^i = \int_V T_{0i} dV &lt;/math&gt;

When the components of the momentum vector of the system are zero, i.e. P&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, the approximate mass of the system is just (E+E&lt;sub&gt;binding&lt;/sub&gt;)/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;binding&lt;/sub&gt; being a negative number representing the Newtonian gravitational self-binding energy.

Hence when one assumes that the system is quasi-static, one assumes that there is no significant energy present in the  form of "gravitational waves".  When one assumes that the system is in "nearly-flat" space-time, one assumes that  the metric coefficients are essentially [[Minkowskian]] within acceptable experimental error.

== History ==
{{Refimprove|date=February 2016}}
In 1918, [[David Hilbert]] wrote about the difficulty in assigning an energy to a "field" and "the failure of the energy theorem" in a correspondence with [[Felix Klein|Klein]].  In this letter, Hilbert conjectured that this failure is a characteristic feature of the general theory, and that instead of "proper energy theorems" one had 'improper energy theorems'.

This conjecture was soon proved to be correct by one of Hilbert's close associates, [[Emmy Noether]].  [[Noether's theorem]] applies to any system which can be described by an [[Action (physics)|action principle]]. Noether's theorem associates conserved energies with time-translation symmetries.   When the time-translation symmetry is a finite parameter [[lie group|continuous group]], such as the [[Poincaré group]], Noether's theorem defines a scalar conserved energy for the system in question.  However, when the symmetry is an infinite parameter continuous group, the existence of a conserved energy is not guaranteed.  In a similar manner, Noether's theorem associates conserved momenta with space-translations, when the [[symmetry group]] of the translations is finite-dimensional.  Because General Relativity is a [[diffeomorphism]] invariant theory, it has an infinite continuous group of symmetries rather than a finite-parameter group of symmetries, and hence has the wrong group structure to guarantee a conserved energy.  Noether's theorem has been extremely influential in inspiring and unifying various ideas of mass, system energy, and system momentum in General Relativity.

As an example of the application of Noether's theorem is the example of stationary space-times and their associated Komar mass.(Komar 1959).  While general space-times lack a finite-parameter time-translation symmetry, stationary space-times have such a symmetry, known as a [[Killing vector]].  Noether's theorem proves that such stationary space-times must have an associated conserved energy.  This conserved energy defines a conserved mass, the Komar mass.

ADM mass was introduced (Arnowitt et al., 1960) from an initial-value formulation of general relativity.  It was later reformulated in terms of the group of asymptotic symmetries at spatial infinity, the SPI group,  by various authors. (Held, 1980).  This reformulation did much to clarify the theory, including explaining why ADM momentum and ADM energy transforms as a 4-vector (Held, 1980).  Note that the SPI group is actually infinite-dimensional.  The existence of conserved quantities is because the SPI group of  "super-translations" has a preferred 4-parameter subgroup of "pure" translations, which, by Noether's theorem, generates a conserved 4-parameter energy–momentum.  The norm of this 4-parameter energy–momentum is the ADM mass.

The Bondi mass was introduced (Bondi, 1962) in a paper that studied the loss of mass of physical systems via gravitational radiation.  The Bondi mass is also associated with a group of asymptotic symmetries, the [[Bondi–Metzner–Sachs group|BMS group]] at null infinity.  Like the SPI group at spatial infinity, the BMS group at null infinity is infinite-dimensional, and it also has a preferred 4-parameter subgroup of "pure" translations.

Another approach to the problem of energy in General Relativity is the use of [[pseudotensor]]s such as the [[Landau-Lifshitz pseudotensor]].(Landau and Lifshitz, 1962). Pseudotensors are not gauge invariant - because of this, they only give consistent gauge-independent answers for the total energy when additional constraints (such as asymptotic flatness) are met.  The gauge dependence of pseudotensors also prevents any gauge-independent definition of the local energy density, as every different gauge choice results in a different local energy density.

== Questions, answers, and simple examples of mass in general relativity ==
{{Original research|date=February 2016}}
{{Refimprove|date=February 2016}}
;In special relativity, the invariant mass of a single particle is always Lorentz invariant.   Can the same thing be said for the mass of a system of particles in general relativity?

:Surprisingly, the answer is no.  A system must either be isolated, or have zero volume, in order for its mass to be Lorentz invariant.  While the ''density'' of energy momentum, the [[stress–energy tensor]] is always Lorentz covariant, the same cannot be said for the total energy–momentum.  (Nakamura, 2005).  Non-covariance of the energy–momentum four-vector implies non-invariance of its length, the invariant mass.

:What this means in simpler language is that one must use great caution when talking about the mass of a non-isolated system.  A non-isolated system is constantly exchanging energy–momentum with its surroundings.  Even when the net rate of exchange of energy–momentum with the environment is zero, differences in the definition of simultaneity cause the total amount of energy–momentum contained within the system at a given instant of time to depend on the definition of simultaneity that is adopted by the observer.  This causes the invariant mass of a non-isolated system to depend on one's choice of coordinates even in special relativity.  Only an isolated system has a coordinate-independent mass.

;Can an object move so fast that it turns into a black hole?

:No.  An object that is not a black hole in its rest frame will not be a black hole in any other frame.  One of the characteristics of a black hole is that a black hole has an event horizon, which light cannot escape.  If light can escape from an object to infinity in the object's rest frame, it can also escape to infinity in a frame in which the object is moving.  The path that the light takes will be [[Aberration of light|aberrated]] by the motion of the object, but the light will still escape to infinity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/black_fast.html If you go too fast, do you become a black hole?]&lt;/ref&gt;

;If two objects have the same mass, and we heat one of them up from an external source, does the heated object gain mass?  If we put both objects on a sensitive enough balance, would the heated object weigh more than the unheated object?  Would the heated object have a stronger gravitational field than the unheated object?

:The answer to all of the above questions is yes.  The hot object has more energy, so it weighs more and has a higher mass than the cold object.  It will also have a higher gravitational field to go along with its higher mass, by the equivalence principle. (Carlip 1999)

;Imagine that we have a solid pressure vessel enclosing an ideal gas.  We heat the gas up with an external source of energy, adding an amount of energy E to the system.  Does the mass of our system increase by E/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;?  Does the mass of the gas increase by E/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;?

:The question is somewhat ambiguous as stated.  Interpreting the question as a question about the Komar mass, the answers to the questions are yes, and no, respectively.  Because the pressure vessel generates a static space-time, the [[Komar mass]] exists, and can be found by treating the ideal gas as an [[Stress–energy tensor#Relativistic stress tensor for an idealized fluid|ideal fluid]].  Using the formula for the Komar mass of a small system in a nearly Minkowskian space-time, one finds that the mass of the system in [[geometrized units]] is equal to  '''E''' + ∫ 3 '''P''' dV, where E is the total energy of the system, and P is the pressure.

:The integral ∫ '''P''' dV over the entire volume of the system is equal to zero, however.  The contribution of the positive pressure in the fluid is exactly canceled out by the contribution of the negative pressure (tension) in the shell.  This cancellation is not accidental, it is a consequence of the relativistic virial theorem (Carlip 1999).

:If we restrict our region of integration to the fluid itself, however, the integral is not zero and the pressure contributes to the mass.  Because the integral of the pressure is positive, we find that the Komar mass of the fluid increases by more than E/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

:The significance of the pressure terms in the Komar formula can best be understood by a thought experiment.  If we assume a spherical pressure vessel, the pressure vessel itself will not contribute to the gravitational acceleration measured by an accelerometer inside the shell.  The Komar mass formula tells us that the surface acceleration we measure just inside the pressure vessel, at the outer edge of the hot gas will be equal to &lt;math&gt;G\left(E + 3 P V \right) / r^2 c^2&lt;/math&gt;

::where E is the total energy (including rest energy) of the hot gas
::G is Newton's Gravitational constant
::P is the pressure of the hot gas
::V is the volume of the pressure vessel.

:This surface acceleration will be higher than expected because of the pressure terms.  In a fully relativistic gas, (this includes a "box of light" as a special case), the contribution of the pressure term 3 P V will be equal to the energy term E, and the acceleration at the surface will be doubled from the value for a non-relativistic gas.

:One might also ask about the answers to this question if one assumed that one were asking about the mass as it is defined in special relativity rather than the Komar mass.  If one assumes that the space-time is nearly Minkowskian, the special relativistic mass exists.   In this case, the answer to the first question is still yes, but the second question cannot be answered without even more data.  Because the system consisting only of the gas is not an isolated system, its mass is not invariant, and thus depends on the choice of observational frame.  A specific choice of observational frame (such as the rest frame of the system) must be specified in order to answer the second question.  If the rest frame of the object is chosen, and special relativistic mass rather than Komar mass is assumed, the answer to the second question becomes yes.  This problem illustrates some of the difficulties one faces when talking about the mass of non-isolated systems.

;The only difference between the "hot" and "cold" systems in our last question is due to the motion of the particles in the gas inside the pressure vessel.  Doesn't this imply that a moving particle has "more gravity" than a stationary particle?

:This remark is probably true in essence, but it is difficult to quantify.

:Unfortunately, it is not clear how to measure the "gravitational field" of a single relativistically moving object.  It is clear that it is possible to view gravity as a force when one has a stationary metric - but the metric associated with a moving mass is not stationary.

:While definitional and measurement issues constrain our ability to quantify the gravitational field of a moving mass, one can measure and quantify the effect of motion on tidal gravitational forces.  When one does so, one finds that the tidal gravity of a moving mass is not spherically symmetrical - it is stronger in some directions than others.  One can also say that, averaged over all directions, the tidal gravity increases when an object moves.

:Some authors have used the total velocity imparted by a "flyby" rather than tidal forces to gain an indirect measure of the increase in gravitational "effective mass" of relativistically moving objects (Olson &amp; Guarino 1985)

:While there is unfortunately no single definitive way to interpret the space-time curvature caused by a moving mass as a Newtonian force, one can definitely say that the motion of the molecules in a hot object increases the mass of that object.

:Note that in General Relativity, gravity is caused not by mass, but by the stress–energy tensor.  Thus, saying that a moving particle has "more gravity" does not imply that the particle has "more mass".  It only implies that the moving particle has "more energy".

;Suppose the pressure vessel in our previous question fails, and the system explodes - does its mass change?

:The mass of the system doesn't change because the vessel (or the pieces of the vessel after it explodes) form an isolated system.  This question does illustrate one of the limitations of the Komar formula - the Komar mass is defined only for stationary systems.  If one applies the Komar formula to this non-static non-stationary system, one gets the incorrect result that the mass of the system changes. The pressure and density of the gas remains constant for a short time after the failure, while the tension in the pressure vessel disappears immediately when the pressure vessel fails.  One cannot correctly apply the Komar formula in this case, however - one needs to apply a different formula, such as the [[ADM mass]] formula, the Newtonian limit formula, or the special relativistic formula.

;What is the mass of the universe?  What is the mass of the observable universe?  Does a closed universe have a mass?

:None of the above questions have answers.  We know the density of the universe (at least in our local area), but we can only speculate on the extent of the universe, making it impossible for us to give a definitive answer for the mass of the universe.  We cannot answer the second question, either.  Since the observable universe isn't asymptotically flat, nor is it stationary, and since it may not be an isolated system, none of our definitions of mass in General Relativity apply, and there is no way to calculate the mass of the observable universe.  The answer to the third question is also no : the following quote from (Misner, et al., pg 457) explains why:

::"There is no such thing as the energy (or angular momentum, or charge) of a closed universe, according to general relativity, and this for a simple reason.  To weigh something one needs a platform on which to stand to do the weighing  ...

::"To determine the electric charge of a body, one surrounds it by a large sphere, evaluates the electric field normal to the surface at each point on this sphere, integrates over the sphere, and applies the theorem of Gauss.  But within any closed model universe with the topology of a 3-sphere, a Gaussian 2-sphere that is expanded widely enough from one point finds itself collapsing to nothingness at the antipodal point.  Also collapsed to nothingness is the attempt to acquire useful information about the "charge of the universe": the charge is trivially zero."

==Biography==
Born and raised in Aberdeen, SD, Guthmiller took an interest in aviation from a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.argusleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/jill-callison/2014/06/02/callison-aberdeen-pilot-flying-around-earth/9857377/ | title=Callison: Aberdeen pilot, 19, flying around Earth | work=[[Argus Leader]] | date=2 June 2014 | accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up he gradually drifted more toward math and science, in particular computer science, which led him to pursue several business ventures.

He started his first company, AnySIMiPhones, at age 12, selling software to [[SIM lock|unlock]] the newly released iPhone, which at the time was only available in the U.S. and only on AT&amp;T, so that it could be used with any ([[GSM]]) cell carrier worldwide. After being in business for only a few weeks, Guthmiller sold his company to a similar company, FreeIt4Less, and joined their team. Together they unlocked around 20,000 iPhones in dozens of countries.&lt;ref name=limitless&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.aberdeennews.com/2013-03-24/news/37988560_1_mit-central-high-school-siemens-award | title=Limitless future awaits brilliant senior at Central High School | work=[[Aberdeen American News]] | date=24 March 2013 | accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the unlocking market dried up after Apple announced the iPhone 3G and its availability in multiple markets in 2008, Guthmiller moved on to pursue his interest in finance. Guthmiller pursued several projects aimed at analyzing financial market data with [[supercomputers]] in order to uncover ways to predict the likelihood of future price movements.&lt;ref name=limitless&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.aberdeennews.com/2013-03-24/news/37988560_1_mit-central-high-school-siemens-award | title=Limitless future awaits brilliant senior at Central High School | work=[[Aberdeen American News]] | date=24 March 2013 | accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tweet he posted earlier this year seems to indicate his latest company aims to bring that kind of work to everyday investors.&lt;ref name=twitter1/&gt;

==Solo flight around the world==
After getting bored one weekend in the summer of 2011, Guthmiller realized he could obtain his pilot certificate in a few months when he turned 17. Having wanted to fly his entire life, he convinced his parents to allow him to do a "$20, 20-minute intro flight" at a local flight school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://radioboston.wbur.org/2014/05/27/mit-youngest-solo | title=MIT Student To Become Youngest Person To Fly Around World Solo
 | work=Radio Boston | date=27 May 2014 | accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instantly hooked. Soloing just a couple weeks later, he earned his [[private pilot certificate]] on his 17th birthday before going on to pursue an [[instrument rating]], [[glider (aircraft)|glider]] rating, his [[commercial pilot certificate]], and a [[seaplane]] rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.limitless-horizons.org/about | title=About | work=Limitless Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reading a May 3, 2013, article about 20-year-old Californian Jack Wiegand, who was about to become the youngest person to fly solo around the world, Guthmiller decided he wanted to attempt the same record. After a year of planning, Guthmiller left [[Gillespie Field]] in [[El Cajon, California]] on May 31, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/01/travel/teen-attempts-global-flight/index.html | title=Teen attempts record-setting solo flight around the world | work=[[CNN]] | date=1 June 2014 | accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 44 days, 12 hours later landed back at Gillespie on July 14, 2014 to become the youngest person to ever circumnavigate the globe by aircraft at 19 years, 7 months, and 15 days old.&lt;ref name="guinness" /&gt; Spending 180 hours in a small, single-engine 1981 [[Beechcraft Bonanza]], he made 23 stops in 15 countries on 5 continents. The longest flight was 16.5 hours from [[Pago Pago, American Samoa]] to [[Hilo, Hawaii]]. In order to carry enough fuel for such long legs, Guthmiller had the rear four seats removed and extra fuel tanks installed and took off as much as 25% over the aircraft's maximum certificated takeoff weight (authorized by an [[FAA]] ferry permit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/teen-matt-guthmiller-sets-record-as-youngest-pilot-to-circle-the-globe | title=Teen sets record as youngest pilot to circle the globe | work=[[CBS This Morning]] | date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guthmiller and the plane have since been featured at [[EAA Airventure Oshkosh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://issuu.com/eaahq/docs/avt_072814_final/30 | title=Presentation Schedule | work=Airventure Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Air and Space Museum]] [[Udvar-Hazy Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= Matt Guthmiller |user= mattguthmiller|number= 610900165092732928 |date= 16 June 2015 |title= Come check out the Bonanza I flew around the world at the @AirAndSpace Udvar-Hazy Center this Saturday 10am-3pm! |access-date= 20 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he shares his story with audiences around the country in various speaking engagements.&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/adrian-brijbassi/matt-guthmiller-around-the-world_b_6875340.html | title=Meet the Youngest Pilot to Fly Around the World Solo | work=[[Huffington Post Canada]] | date=16 March 2015 | accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Molybdite''' is the naturally occurring mineral form of [[molybdenum trioxide]] MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It occurs as yellow to greenish needles and crystallizes in the [[orthorhombic]] [[crystal system]].

== Discovery and occurrence ==
Molybdite was first described in 1854 for and occurrence in quartz veins in the [[Knöttel]] area of [[Krupka]], [[Erzgebirge|Krušné Hory Mountains]] in the [[Ústí nad Labem Region|Ústí Region]] of [[Bohemia]], [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; It occurs in vein cavities and as coatings in [[molybdenite]] ore veins and [[quartz]] [[topaz]] [[greisen]]s. Associated minerals include molybdenite, [[betpakdalite]] and quartz.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt; The similar mineral [[ferrimolybdite]] is often misidentified as molybdite.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization'''|新エネルギー・産業技術総合開発機構}}, or '''NEDO,''' is Japan's largest public management organization promoting research and development as well as deployment of industrial, energy and environmental technologies. In 2003, NEDO was reorganized as an [[Independent Administrative Institution]]. NEDO has approximately 1,000 personnel and domestic offices in Hokkaido, Kansai, and Kyushu and international offices in Washington D.C., Silicon Valley (California), Paris, Beijing, Bangkok, Jakarta and New Delhi. Its budget for fiscal year 2009 was 234,700,000,000 yen (approximately $2.6 billion), the vast majority of which was provided by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). Its head office is located just outside Tokyo in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki City]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]].

NEDO has a number of projects in the United States, notably a [[smart grid]] and alternative energy project with two research laboratories in New Mexico, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9GD41001.htm  http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9GD41001.htm  Businessweek.com:  “Companies picked for Japan-NM smart grid projects.” June 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2010, NEDO and the laboratories signed agreements in which NEDO will fund a smart grid research facility at LANL and smart house demonstration projects in both [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]] and [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico.  NEDO is investing $30 million (U.S.) on the projects for a four-year period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2010/03/01/daily52.html New Mexico Business Weekly: “Japan signs smart-grid accords with New Mexico.” Robinson, March 5, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
*October 1, 1980 - In response to the [[energy crises]] of 1973 and 1978, the New Energy and Development Organization is established under the Law Concerning the Promotion of the Development and Introduction of Alternative Energy to develop fossil fuel alternative energy technologies in order to stabilize world energy supplies and reduce Japan's dependency on imported energy sources.
*October 1, 1988 - Reorganized and scope of activities is expanded to include the research and development of industrial technologies. Name is changed to New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (acronym remains NEDO).
*October 1, 2003 NEDO becomes an Independent Administrative Institution
*2005 - NEDO Pavilion at [[Expo 2005]], shares the results of many NEDO funded and managed R&amp;D projects, including solar photovoltaic, fuel cell and robotic technology. 
*2010- NEDO and [[Hokkaido University]] developed a motor using magnets which are commonly used in electronics parts to lessen the burden of utilizing rare earth minerals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-technology/japan-develops-hybrid-car-motor-free-of-rare-earths-20101001-15zj5.html Japan develops hybrid car motor free of rare earths]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On march 19th 2017 a memorandum of understanding was signed to build a large-scale hybrid battery system demonstration project in Germany. The project aims to stabilize the distribution grid, and thereby control the electric power supply and demand balance, by charging and discharging storage batteries, and to establish a new business model for electricity trading using the battery system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nedo.go.jp/english/news/AA5en_100185.html Large-Scale Hybrid Battery System Demonstration Project to Launch in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mw.niedersachsen.de/aktuelles/presseinformationen/in-varel-wird-eine-der-groeten-batterien-norddeutschlands-gebaut-152151.html In Varel wird eine der größten Batterien Norddeutschlands gebaut (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuclear power''' is the use of [[nuclear reaction]]s that release [[Nuclear binding energy|nuclear energy]] to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in [[steam turbine]]s to produce electricity in a [[nuclear power plant]]. 
Nuclear power can be obtained from [[nuclear fission]], [[nuclear decay]] and [[nuclear fusion]]. 
Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]].
Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s.
The possibility of generating electricity from nuclear fusion is still at a research phase with no commercial applications.
This article mostly deals with nuclear fission power for electricity generation.

Nuclear power is one of the leading [[low carbon power generation]] methods of producing [[electricity]].
In terms of [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|total life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy generated]], nuclear power has emission values comparable or lower than [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="Nrel.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_nuclear.html | title=Nuclear Power Results – Life Cycle Assessment Harmonization| quote=Collectively, life cycle assessment literature shows that nuclear power is similar to other renewable and much lower than fossil fuel in total life cycle GHG emissions. |publisher=nrel.gov |author= National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2013-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702205635/http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_nuclear.html |archivedate=2013-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From the beginning of its commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power prevented about 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels in [[thermal power station]]s.&lt;ref name="Kharecha Pushker A 2013 4889–4895"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prevented Mortality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Historical and Projected Nuclear Power – global nuclear power has prevented an average of 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and 64 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent (GtCO2-eq) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning |doi=10.1021/es3051197 |pmid=23495839 |ref=harv|bibcode = 2013EnST...47.4889K |volume=47 |issue=9 |journal=Environmental Science |pages=4889–4895 |year=2013 |author=Kharecha Pushker A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian nuclear power supplied 2,488 [[terawatt hour]]s (TWh) of electricity in 2017, equivalent to about 10% of global electricity generation.&lt;ref name="iaea_pris" /&gt;
As of April 2018, there are [[List of nuclear reactors|449 civilian fission reactors in the world]], with a combined electrical capacity of 394 [[gigawatt]] (GW). 
Additionally, there are 58 reactors under construction and 154 reactors planned, with a combined capacity of 63 GW and 157 GW, respectively. Over 300 more reactors are proposed.&lt;ref name=WNA&gt;{{cite web|title=World Nuclear Power Reactors {{!}} Uranium Requirements {{!}} Future Nuclear Power - World Nuclear Association|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/world-nuclear-power-reactors-and-uranium-requireme.aspx|website=www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of reactors under construction are of [[generation III reactor]] design, with the majority in Asia.&lt;ref name="iaea_pris" /&gt;

There is a social [[Nuclear power debate|debate about nuclear power]].
Proponents, such as the [[World Nuclear Association]] and [[Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy]], contend that nuclear power is a safe, [[Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|sustainable energy]] source that reduces [[carbon emissions]].
[[Anti-nuclear movement|Opponents]], such as [[Greenpeace]] and [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service|NIRS]], contend that nuclear power poses many threats to [[Environmental radioactivity|people and the environment]].

Some [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|accidents]] have occurred in nuclear power plants. 
These include the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in the Soviet Union in 1986, the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in Japan in 2011, and the more contained [[Three Mile Island accident]] in the United States in 1979.
There have also been some nuclear submarine accidents.
In terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated, nuclear reactors have caused the lowest number of fatalities per unit of energy generated when compared to the other major energy producing methods.
Coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydroelectricity each have caused a greater number of fatalities per unit of energy, due to air pollution and [[Energy accidents|accidents]].&lt;ref name="MarkandyaWilkinson2007" /&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|The [[Nuclear binding energy]] of all natural elements in the periodic table. Higher values translate into more tightly bound nuclei and greater nuclear stability. [[Iron]] (Fe) is the end product of [[nucleosynthesis]] within the core of [[hydrogen]] fusing stars. The elements surrounding iron are the [[fission products]] of the fissionable [[actinides]] (e.g. uranium). Except for iron, all other elemental nuclei have in theory the potential to be nuclear fuel, and the greater distance from iron the greater [[nuclear potential energy]] that could be released.]]
{{See also|Nuclear fission#History|Atomic Age}}
In 1932 physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered that when lithium atoms were "split" by protons from a proton accelerator, immense amounts of energy were released in accordance with the principle of [[mass–energy equivalence]]. However, he and other nuclear physics pioneers [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Albert Einstein]] believed harnessing the power of the atom for practical purposes anytime in the near future was unlikely, with Rutherford labeling such expectations "moonshine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/mp/p1s2.shtml |title=Moonshine |publisher=Atomicarchive.com |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, his doctoral student [[James Chadwick]] discovered the [[neutron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/mp/p1s1.shtml |title=The Atomic Solar System |publisher=Atomicarchive.com |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was immediately recognized as a potential tool for nuclear experimentation because of its lack of an electric charge. Experimentation with bombardment of materials with neutrons led [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Frédéric]] and [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] to discover [[induced radioactivity]] in 1934, which allowed the creation of radium-like elements at much less the price of natural radium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebigger.com/chemistry/nuclear-and-radiation-chemistry/what-do-you-mean-by-induced-radioactivity-2/ |title=What do you mean by Induced Radioactivity? |author=taneya says: |publisher=Thebigger.com |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work by [[Enrico Fermi]] in the 1930s focused on using [[slow neutron]]s to increase the effectiveness of induced radioactivity. Experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons led Fermi to believe he had created a new, transuranic element, which was dubbed [[hesperium]].&lt;ref name=Np&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderkrogt.net/elements/element.php?sym=Np |title=Neptunium |publisher=Vanderkrogt.net |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, German chemists [[Otto Hahn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1944/hahn-bio.html |title=Otto Hahn, The Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1944 |accessdate=2007-11-01 |publisher=Nobelprize.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fritz Strassmann]], along with Austrian physicist [[Lise Meitner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/otto-hahn-lise-meitner-and-fritz-strassmann |title=Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann, and Lise Meitner |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |publisher=Science History Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Meitner's nephew, [[Otto Robert Frisch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/biographies/bio_frisch-otto.htm |title=Otto Robert Frisch |accessdate=2007-11-01 |publisher=Nuclearfiles.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525170523/http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/biographies/bio_frisch-otto.htm# |archive-date=2017-05-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted experiments with the products of neutron-bombarded uranium, as a means of further investigating Fermi's claims. 
They determined that the relatively tiny neutron split the nucleus of the massive uranium atoms into two roughly equal pieces, contradicting Fermi.&lt;ref name=Np/&gt; 
This was an extremely surprising result: all other forms of [[nuclear decay]] involved only small changes to the mass of the nucleus, whereas this process—dubbed "fission" as a [[binary fission|reference to biology]]—involved a complete rupture of the nucleus. 
Numerous scientists, including [[Leó Szilárd]], who was one of the first, recognized that if fission reactions released additional neutrons, a self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]] could result. Once this was experimentally confirmed and announced by Frédéric Joliot-Curie in 1939, scientists in many countries (including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union) petitioned their governments for support of nuclear fission research, just on the cusp of World War II, for the development of a [[nuclear weapon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/mp/introduction.shtml |title=The Einstein Letter |publisher=Atomicarchive.com |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First nuclear reactor===
In the United States, where Fermi and Szilárd had both emigrated, the discovery of the nuclear chain reaction led to the creation of the first man-made reactor, known as [[Chicago Pile-1]], which achieved [[Critical mass|criticality]] on December 2, 1942. 
This work became part of the [[Manhattan Project]], a massive secret U.S. government military project to make [[enriched uranium]] and by building large production reactors to produce (''breed'') [[plutonium]] for use in the first nuclear weapons. 
The United States would test an atom bomb in July 1945 with the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]], and eventually two such weapons were used in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

[[File:First four nuclear lit bulbs.jpeg|thumb|left|The first light bulbs ever lit by electricity generated by nuclear power at [[EBR-1]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne National Laboratory-West]], December 20, 1951.]]

In August 1945, the first widely distributed account of nuclear energy, in the form of the pocketbook ''The Atomic Age'', discussed the peaceful future uses of nuclear energy and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused. 
Nobel laureate [[Glenn Seaborg]], who later chaired the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], is quoted as saying "there will be [[Nuclear thermal rocket|nuclear powered earth-to-moon shuttles]], nuclear powered [[artificial heart]]s, plutonium heated swimming pools for SCUBA divers, and much more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wendt |first1=Gerald |last2=Geddes |first2=Donald Porter |title=The Atomic Age Opens |date=1945 |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York, NY |url=http://alsos.wlu.edu/information.aspx?id=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity was generated for the first time by a nuclear reactor on December 20, 1951, at the [[EBR-I]] experimental station near [[Arco, Idaho]], which initially produced about 100&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/frt.shtml |title=Reactors Designed by Argonne National Laboratory: Fast Reactor Technology |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory |year=2012 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Reactor Makes Electricity."] ''Popular Mechanics'', March 1952, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Work was also strongly researched in the United States on nuclear marine propulsion, with a test reactor being developed by 1953 (eventually, the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS Nautilus]], the first nuclear-powered submarine, would launch in 1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/lwr3.shtml#fragment-2 |title=STR (Submarine Thermal Reactor) in "Reactors Designed by Argonne National Laboratory: Light Water Reactor Technology Development" |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory |year=2012 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1953, American President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] gave his "[[Atoms for Peace]]" speech at the United Nations, emphasizing the need to develop "peaceful" uses of nuclear power quickly. This was followed by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954|1954 Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act]] which allowed rapid declassification of U.S. reactor technology and encouraged development by the private sector.

===Early years===
On June 27, 1954, the [[USSR]]'s [[Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant]] became the world's first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a [[power grid]], and produced around 5 megawatts of electric power.&lt;ref name="IAEANews"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2004/obninsk.html |title=From Obninsk Beyond: Nuclear Power Conference Looks to Future |website=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] | accessdate = 2006-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WNA2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf45.htm |title=Nuclear Power in Russia |website=[[World Nuclear Association]] | accessdate = 2006-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1954, [[Lewis Strauss]], then chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (U.S. AEC, forerunner of the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Energy]]) spoke of electricity in the future being "[[too cheap to meter]]".&lt;ref name="thisdayinquotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2009/09/too-cheap-to-meter-nuclear-quote-debate.html |title=This Day in Quotes: SEPTEMBER 16 – Too cheap to meter: the great nuclear quote debate |accessdate=2009-09-16 |publisher=This day in quotes |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss was very likely referring to hydrogen fusion&lt;ref&gt;Pfau, Richard (1984) ''No Sacrifice Too Great: The Life of Lewis L. Strauss'' University Press of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0813910382 p. 187] {{ISBN|978-0-8139-1038-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; —which was secretly being developed as part of [[Project Sherwood]] at the time—but Strauss's statement was interpreted as a promise of very cheap energy from nuclear fission. The U.S. AEC itself had issued far more realistic testimony regarding nuclear fission to the U.S. Congress only months before, projecting that "costs can be brought down... [to]... about the same as the cost of electricity from conventional sources..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/?id=qBqbr8uV9c8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=strauss+son+cheap+meter | title= ''Nuclear Energy: Principles, Practices, and Prospects'' |author= David Bodansky |work= |publisher=Springer |page= 32 |doi= | accessdate= 2008-01-31 | isbn= 978-0-387-20778-0 | year= 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 the United Nations' "First Geneva Conference", then the world's largest gathering of scientists and engineers, met to explore the technology. In 1957 [[EURATOM]] was launched alongside the [[European Economic Community]] (the latter is now the European Union). The same year also saw the launch of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).

One of the first organizations to develop nuclear power was the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], for the purpose of propelling [[submarine]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s. The first nuclear-powered submarine, {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, was put to sea in December 1954.&lt;ref name = "iaeapdf"/&gt; As of 2016, the U.S. Navy submarine fleet is made up entirely of nuclear-powered vessels, with 75 submarines in service.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Two U.S. nuclear submarines, {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589|6}} and {{USS|Thresher|SSN-593|6}}, have been lost at sea.

The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] also had a [[Army Nuclear Power Program|nuclear power program]], beginning in 1954. The [[SM-1]] Nuclear Power Plant, at [[Fort Belvoir]], [[Virginia]], was the first power reactor in the United States to supply electrical energy to a commercial grid (VEPCO), in April 1957, before Shippingport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nab.usace.army.mil/portals/63/docs/FactSheets/FY15_Factsheets/VA-SM-1%20DNPPP.pdf|title=SM-1 Nuclear Power Plant, VA|date=2015-02-01|publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SL-1]] was a U.S. Army experimental nuclear power reactor at the [[Idaho National Laboratory|National Reactor Testing Station]] in [[eastern Idaho]]. It underwent a [[steam explosion]] and [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] in January 1961, which killed its three operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKeown |first=William |title=Idaho Falls: The Untold Story of America's First Nuclear Accident |isbn=978-1-55022-562-4 |year=2003 |publisher=ECW Press |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Soviet Union at the [[Mayak]] Production Association facility there were a number of accidents, including a 1957 explosion that contaminated a huge territory in the eastern Urals and caused numerous deaths and injuries. The Soviet government kept this accident secret for about 30 years. The event was eventually rated at 6 on the seven-level INES scale (third in severity only to the disasters at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima nuclear accident|Fukushima]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Kyshtym-disaster|title=Kyshtym disaster|last=Lewis|first=Robert|date=2018-09-22|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Satsop Development Park 07780.JPG|thumb|[[Washington Public Power Supply System]] Nuclear Power Plants 3 and 5 were never completed.]]

Installed nuclear capacity initially rose relatively quickly, rising from less than 1 [[gigawatt]] (GW) in 1960 to 100 GW in the late 1970s, and 300 GW in the late 1980s. Since the late 1980s worldwide capacity has risen much more slowly, reaching 366 GW in 2005. Between around 1970 and 1990, more than 50 GW of capacity was under construction (peaking at over 150 GW in the late 1970s and early 1980s) — in 2005, around 25 GW of new capacity was planned. More than two-thirds of all nuclear plants ordered after January 1970 were eventually cancelled.&lt;ref name="iaeapdf"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC48/Documents/gc48inf-4_ftn3.pdf |title=50 Years of Nuclear Energy |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of [[List of canceled nuclear plants in the United States|63 nuclear units were canceled]] in the United States between 1975 and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C5W8uxwMqdUC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=%22nuclear+power+industry%22+history+u.s.

During the 1970s and 1980s rising economic costs (related to extended construction times largely due to regulatory changes and pressure-group litigation)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bernard L. Cohen |date=1990 |title=The Nuclear Energy Option: An Alternative for the 90s |url=http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter9.html |location=New York |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-43567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and falling fossil fuel prices made nuclear power plants then under construction less attractive. In the 1980s (U.S.) and 1990s (Europe), flat load growth and [[electricity liberalization]] also made the addition of large new baseload capacity unattractive.

The [[1973 oil crisis]] had a significant effect on countries, such as France and Japan, which had relied more heavily on oil for electric generation (39%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iea.org/textbase/stats/pdf_graphs/FRELEC.pdf |title=Evolution of Electricity Generation by Fuel }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(39.4&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 73% respectively) to invest in nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Beder, '[http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/privatisation/japan.html The Japanese Situation]', English version of conclusion of Sharon Beder, "Power Play: The Fight to Control the World's Electricity", Soshisha, Japan, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three Mile Island and Chernobyl===
[[File:Центр города Припять на фоне 4 энергоблокаа ЧАЭС.jpg|thumb|The abandoned city of [[Pripyat (city)|Pripyat]] with Chernobyl plant and the [[Chernobyl New Safe Confinement]] arch, in the distance.]]

Health and safety concerns, the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident|accident at Three Mile Island]], and the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] played a part in stopping new plant construction in many countries,&lt;ref name=wolfgang&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Wolfgang |editor1-last=Rüdig|title=Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXwfAQAAIAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Longman Current Affairs|location=Detroit, MI|isbn=978-0-8103-9000-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the public policy organization, the [[Brookings Institution]] states that new nuclear units, at the time of publishing in 2006, had not been built in the United States because of soft demand for electricity, and [[cost overrun]]s on nuclear plants due to regulatory issues and construction delays.&lt;ref name="tbi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2004/09environment_nivola/pb138.pdf |title=The Political Economy of Nuclear Energy in the United States |format=PDF |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=The Brookings Institution |year=2004 |website=Social Policy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103011953/http://www3.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2004/09environment_nivola/pb138.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1970s it became clear that nuclear power would not grow nearly as dramatically as once believed. Eventually, more than 120 reactor orders in the United States were ultimately cancelled&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33442.pdf Nuclear Power: Outlook for New U.S. Reactors] p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the construction of new reactors ground to a halt. A cover story in the February 11, 1985, issue of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine commented on the overall failure of the U.S. nuclear power program, saying it "ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |date=1985-02-11 |title=Nuclear Follies |journal=Forbes Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Three Mile Island accident, the much more serious Chernobyl accident did not increase regulations affecting Western reactors since the Chernobyl reactors were of the problematic [[RBMK]] design only used in the Soviet Union, for example lacking "robust" [[containment building]]s.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html |title=Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident |website=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] | accessdate = 2006-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these RBMK reactors are still in use today. However, changes were made in both the reactors themselves (use of a safer enrichment of uranium) and in the control system (prevention of disabling safety systems), amongst other things, to reduce the possibility of a duplicate accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf31.html |title=RBMK Reactors &amp;#124; reactor bolshoy moshchnosty kanalny &amp;#124; Positive void coefficient |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date=2009-09-07 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international organization to promote safety awareness and professional development on operators in nuclear facilities was created: [[World Association of Nuclear Operators]] (WANO).

Opposition in Ireland and Poland prevented nuclear programs there, while Austria (1978), Sweden (1980) and Italy (1987) (influenced by Chernobyl) voted in referendums to oppose or phase out nuclear power. In July 2009, the Italian Parliament passed a law that cancelled the results of an earlier referendum and allowed the immediate start of the Italian nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Italy rejoins the nuclear family | publisher = World Nuclear News | date = 2009-07-10 | url = http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Italy_rejoins_the_nuclear_family_1007091.html | accessdate = 2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] a one-year moratorium was placed on nuclear power development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9M504RG0.htm | title=Italy puts one year moratorium on nuclear | date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a referendum in which over 94% of voters (turnout 57%) rejected plans for new nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13741105 | work=BBC News | title=Italy nuclear: Berlusconi accepts referendum blow | date=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]] on 11 March 2011, one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, and a subsequent tsunami off the coast of Japan, the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] suffered multiple core meltdowns due to failure of the emergency cooling system for lack of electricity supply.

Nuclear power generation had the biggest ever fall year-on-year in 2012, with nuclear power plants globally producing 2,346 TWh of electricity, a drop of 7% from 2011. 
This was caused primarily by the majority of Japanese reactors remaining offline that year and the permanent closure of eight reactors in Germany.&lt;ref name=wna13&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Nuclear_power_down_in_2012_2006131.html |title=Nuclear power down in 2012 |author=WNA |date=2013-06-20 |website=World Nuclear News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Fukushima===
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident sparked controversy about the importance of the accident and its effect on nuclear's future. 
The crisis prompted countries with nuclear power to review the safety of their reactor fleet and reconsider the speed and scale of planned nuclear expansions.&lt;ref name="Platts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/ElectricPower/6925550 |title=News Analysis: Japan crisis puts global nuclear expansion in doubt |date=2011-03-21 |publisher=Platts}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2011, ''The Economist'' opined that nuclear power "looks dangerous, unpopular, expensive and risky", and that "it is replaceable with relative ease and could be forgone with no huge structural shifts in the way the world works".&lt;ref name=econ2011&gt;{{cite news |date=2011-03-24 |title=Nuclear power: When the steam clears |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Earth Institute Director Jeffrey Sachs disagreed, claiming combating climate change would require an expansion of nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/03/nuclear-power-solution-climate-change|title=Nuclear power is only solution to climate change, says Jeffrey Sachs|first=Fiona|last=Harvey|date=3 May 2012|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, German engineering giant [[Siemens]] announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry as a response to the Fukushima accident.&lt;ref name=BBC18Sep2011&gt;{{cite news |date=2011-09-18 |title=Siemens to quit nuclear industry |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14963575 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Broder |date=2011-10-10 |title=The Year of Peril and Promise in Energy Production |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/business/energy-environment/the-year-of-peril-and-promise-in-energy-production.html?src=un&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjson8.nytimes.com%2Fpages%2Fbusiness%2Fglobal%2Findex.jsonp |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the construction of two additional reactors at the [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant]], the first reactors to be approved in over 30 years since the Three Mile Island accident.&lt;ref name=yah12&gt;{{cite news | author=Hsu, Jeremy | date=2012-02-09 | title=First Next-Gen US Reactor Designed to Avoid Fukushima Repeat | url=https://news.yahoo.com/first-next-gen-us-reactor-designed-avoid-fukushima-005203660.html | publisher=Live Science (hosted on Yahoo!) | accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2016, [[Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station|Watts Bar 2]] became the first new United States reactor to enter commercial operation since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blau |first=Max |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/us/tennessee-nuclear-power-plant/index.html |title=First new US nuclear reactor in 20 years goes live |work=CNN.com |publisher=Cable News Network.

In 2013 Japan signed a deal worth $22 billion, in which [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] would build four modern ''[[Atmea]]'' reactors for Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey Prepares to Host First ATMEA 1 Nuclear Reactors |url=http://www.powermag.com/turkey-prepares-to-host-first-atmea-1-nuclear-reactors/ |work=PowerMag |publisher=Electric Power |accessdate=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In August 2015, following 4 years of near zero fission-electricity generation, Japan began restarting its nuclear reactors, after [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster#Equipment, facility, and operational changes|safety upgrades were completed]], beginning with [[Sendai Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kyuden.co.jp/en_information_150811.html |title=Startup of Sendai Nuclear Power Unit No.1 |date=2015-08-11 |website=Kyushu Electric Power Company Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, the IAEA's outlook for nuclear energy had become more promising. 
"Nuclear power is a critical element in limiting greenhouse gas emissions," the agency noted, and "the prospects for nuclear energy remain positive in the medium to long term despite a negative impact in some countries in the aftermath of the [Fukushima-Daiichi] accident...it is still the second-largest source worldwide of low-carbon electricity. 
And the 72 reactors under construction at the start of last year were the most in 25 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/news/2015/january/taking-a-fresh-look-at-the-future-of-nuclear-power.html|title=January: Taking a fresh look at the future of nuclear power|website=www.iea.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the World Nuclear Association, as of 2015 the global trend was for new nuclear power stations coming online to be balanced by the number of old plants being retired.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Nuclear Association]], "[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide/ Plans for New Reactors Worldwide]", October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, [[List of nuclear reactors|441 reactors]] had a worldwide net electric capacity of 382,9 GW, with 67 new nuclear reactors under construction.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_May_22_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/ten-new-nuclear-power-reactors-connected-to-grid-in-2015-highest-number-since-1990 |title=Ten New Nuclear Power Reactors Connected to Grid in 2015, Highest Number Since 1990 |accessdate= May 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the International Energy Agency reported that the Fukushima accident had a strongly negative effect on nuclear power, yet nuclear power prospects are positive in the medium to long term mainly thanks to new construction in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/news/2015/january/taking-a-fresh-look-at-the-future-of-nuclear-power.html Taking a fresh look at the future of nuclear power], International Energy Agency, 29 Jan. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected for its “base case” that world nuclear power generation would increase from 2,344 [[terawatt hour]]s (TWh) in 2012 to 4,501 TWh in 2040. 
Most of the predicted increase was expected to be in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=31-IEO2016&amp;sourcekey=0 International Energy outlook 2016], US Energy Information Administration, accessed 17 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The future of nuclear power varies greatly between countries, depending on government policies. 
Some countries, many of them in Europe, such as Germany, Belgium, and Lithuania, have adopted policies of [[nuclear power phase-out]]. 
At the same time, some Asian countries, such as China&lt;ref&gt;James Conca, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/10/22/china-shows-how-to-build-nuclear-reactors-fast-and-cheap/#75c618694d0b "China shows how to build nuclear reactors fast and cheap"], ''Forbes'', 22 O ct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asia.nikkei.com/magazine/20160616-POWER-PERFORMERS-of-the-Asia300/Business/Nuclear-power-plant-builders-see-new-opportunities-in-India "Nuclear power plant builders see new opportunities in India"], Nikkei, 16 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; have committed to rapid expansion of nuclear power. 
Many other countries, such as the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/08/economist-explains-5 "The problem with Britain's (planned) nuclear power station"], ''The Economist'', 7 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States, have policies in between. 
Japan generated about 30% of its electricity from nuclear power before the Fukushima accident.
In 2015 the Japanese government committed to the aim of restarting its fleet of 40 reactors by 2030 after safety upgrades, and to finish the construction of the Generation III [[Ōma Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2018/03/19/japan-court-rejects-lawsuit-against-construction-of-nuclear-plant/&lt;/ref&gt; 
This would mean that approximately 20% of electricity would come from nuclear power by 2030.
As of 2018, some reactors have restarted commercial operation following inspections and upgrades with new regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/japan-nuclear-power.aspx|title=Nuclear Power in Japan|last=|first=|date=2016|website=World Nuclear Association|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems are related to very strict safety requirements, uncertain regulatory environment, slow rate of construction, and large stretches of time with no nuclear construction and consequent loss of know-how.
Commentators therefore argue that nuclear power is impractical in western countries because of high costs, popular opposition, and regulatory uncertainty.&lt;ref name=jmc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2013/11/10/new-build-nuclear-is-dead-morningstar/ |title=New-Build Nuclear Is Dead: Morningstar |author=Jeff McMahon |date=2013-11-10 |work=Forbes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Quiggin"&gt;{{cite news |author=John Quiggin |date=2013-11-08 |title=Reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction.

In 2016 the [[BN-800]] sodium cooled [[fast reactor]] in Russia, began commercial electricity generation, while plans for a [[BN-1200]] were initially conceived the future of the fast reactor program in Russia awaits the results from MBIR, an under construction multi-loop [[Generation IV]] research facility for testing the chemically more inert lead, lead-[[bismuth]] and [[gas cooled fast reactor|gas coolants]], it will similarly run on recycled [[MOX]] (mixed uranium and plutonium oxide) fuel. An on-site [[pyroprocessing|pyrochemical processing]], closed fuel-cycle facility, is planned, to reduce the necessity for a growth in uranium mining and exploration. In 2017 the manufacture program for the reactor commenced with the facility open to collaboration under the "International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycle", it has a construction schedule, that includes an operational start in 2020. As planned, it will be the world's most-powerful research reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/russia-starts-build-mbir-vessel-claire-louise-istedl|title=Russia starts to build MBIR vessel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Nuclear Association]], globally during the 1980s one new nuclear reactor started up every 17&amp;nbsp;days on average, and in the year 2015 it was estimated that this rate could in theory eventually increase to one every 5&amp;nbsp;days, although no plans exist for that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf17.html Plans For New Reactors Worldwide], World Nuclear Association&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear power plants==
[[File:PWR nuclear power plant animation.webm|thumb|thumbtime=2|An animation of a [[Pressurized water reactor]] in operation.]]
{{main|Nuclear power plant}}
{{see also|List of nuclear reactors}}
Just as many conventional [[thermal power station]]s generate electricity by harnessing the [[thermal energy]] released from burning [[fossil fuels]], nuclear power plants convert the energy released from the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an atom via [[nuclear fission]] that takes place in a nuclear reactor. When a [[neutron]] hits the nucleus of a [[uranium-235]] or [[plutonium]] atom, it can split the nucleus into two smaller nuclei. The reaction is called nuclear fission. The fission reaction releases energy and neutrons. The released neutrons can hit other uranium or plutonium nuclei, causing new fission reactions, which release more energy and more neutrons. This is called a [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]]. The reaction rate is controlled by [[Control rod|control rods]] that absorb excess neutrons. The controllability of nuclear reactors depends on the fact that a small fraction of neutrons resulting from fission are [[Delayed neutron|delayed]]. The time delay between the fission and the release of the neutrons slows down changes in reaction rates and gives time for moving the control rods to adjust the reaction rate.&lt;ref name=WNAnuclearreactorbasics&gt;{{cite web |title=How does a nuclear reactor make electricity? - World Nuclear Association |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/nuclear-basics/how-does-a-nuclear-reactor-make-electricity.aspx |website=www.world-nuclear.org |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/atomic-age-began-75-years-ago-with-the-first-controlled-nuclear-chain-reaction/|title=Atomic age began 75 years ago with the first controlled nuclear chain reaction|last=Spyrou|first=Artemis|date=2017-12-03|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-11-18|last2=Mittig|first2=Wolfgang|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fission nuclear power plant is generally composed of a [[nuclear reactor]], in which the nuclear reactions generating heat take place; a cooling system, which removes the heat from inside the reactor; a [[steam turbine]], which transforms the heat in [[mechanical energy]]; an [[electric generator]], which transform the mechanical energy into electrical energy.&lt;ref name=WNAnuclearreactorbasics /&gt;

Nuclear fission power stations, excluding the contribution from [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval nuclear fission reactors]], provided 11% of the world's electricity in 2012,&lt;ref name="oecd_pdf"&gt;{{Cite journal | url= https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/kwes.pdf | title=Key World Energy Statistics 2012 | accessdate=2012-12-16 | publisher= [[International Energy Agency]] | year=2012 | format=PDF | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; somewhat less than that generated by [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric stations]] at 16%. 
Since electricity accounts for about 25% of humanity's energy usage with the majority of the rest coming from fossil fuel reliant sectors such as transport, manufacture and home heating, nuclear fission's contribution to the [[World energy consumption|global final energy consumption]] was about 2.5%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicola Armaroli]], [[Vincenzo Balzani]], ''Towards an electricity-powered world''.

Nuclear power's share of global electricity production has fallen from 16.5% in 1997 to about 10% in 2017, in large part because the economics of nuclear power have become more difficult.&lt;ref name=ft-20180903&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/fa6ca7ac-ab9a-11e8-89a1-e5de165fa619 |title=The challenge for nuclear is to recover its competitive edge |last=Butler |first=Nick |newspaper=Financial Times |date=3 September 2018 |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear energy policy]] differs among European Union countries, and some, such as Austria, [[Estonia]], Ireland and [[Nuclear power in Italy|Italy]], have no active nuclear power stations.

==Economics==
{{Main|Economics of nuclear power plants}}
[[File:Ikata Nuclear Powerplant.JPG|thumb|The [[Ikata Nuclear Power Plant]], a [[pressurized water reactor]] that cools by utilizing a secondary coolant [[heat exchanger]] with a large body of water, an alternative cooling approach to large [[cooling towers]].]]
The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multibillion-dollar investments depend on the choice of an energy source. 
Nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low fuel costs. 
Comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants as well as the future costs of fossil fuels and renewables as well as for energy storage solutions for intermittent power sources. 
Cost estimates also need to take into account [[nuclear decommissioning|plant decommissioning]] and [[nuclear waste]] storage costs. 
On the other hand, measures to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] [[global warming]], such as a [[carbon tax]] or [[carbon emissions trading]], may favor the economics of nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Update of the MIT 2003 Future of Nuclear Power |date=2009 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-update2009.pdf |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Splitting the cost |url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2009/11/12/splitting-the-cost |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=The Economist |date=12 November 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must also take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. 
To date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by [[Nationalized|state-owned]] or [[Regulated market|regulated]] [[electric utility]] monopolies&lt;ref name=ft-20100912&gt;{{cite news |author=Ed Crooks |date=2010-09-12 |title=Nuclear: New dawn now seems limited to the east |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad15fcfe-bc71-11df-a42b-00144feab49a.html |newspaper=Financial Times |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; where many of the risks associated with construction costs, operating performance, fuel price, accident liability and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers. 
In addition, because the potential liability from a nuclear accident is so great, the full cost of liability insurance is generally limited/capped by the government, which the [[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] concluded constituted a significant subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 1983. The Price-Anderson Act: the Third Decade, NUREG-0957&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many countries have now liberalized the [[electricity market]] where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=MIT-2003&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-615-12420-9 |accessdate=2006-11-10 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nuclear power plants can vary their output, the electricity is generally less favorably priced when doing so. 
Nuclear power plants are therefore typically run as much as possible to keep the cost of the generated electrical energy as low as possible, supplying mostly base-load electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oecd-nea.org/nea-news/2011/29-2/nea-news-29-2-load-following-e.pdf Load-following with nuclear power plants by A. Lokhov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally the price of nuclear plants rose 15% annually in 1970–1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gore |first=Al |date=2009 |title=Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis |publisher=Rodale |location=Emmaus, PA |pages= |isbn = 978-1-59486-734-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} 
Yet, nuclear power has total costs in 2012 of about $96 per megawatt hour (MWh), most of which involves capital construction costs, compared with solar power at $130 per MWh, and natural gas at the low end at $64 per MWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 May 2015 |title=What does nuclear power actually cost #peakoil |url=http://northdenvernews.com/what-does-nuclear-power-actually-cost-peakoil/ |newspaper=North Denver News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, costs are expected to increase for then-operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/mitei/research/studies/documents/nuclear-fuel-cycle/The_Nuclear_Fuel_Cycle-all.pdf |title=The Future of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2011 |website= |page=xv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle of nuclear fuel==
[[File:Nuclear Fuel Cycle.png|thumb|The nuclear fuel cycle begins when uranium is mined, enriched, and manufactured into nuclear fuel, (1) which is delivered to a [[nuclear power plant]]. After usage in the power plant, the spent fuel is delivered to a reprocessing plant (2) or to a final repository (3) for geological disposition. In [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] 95% of spent fuel can potentially be recycled to be returned to usage in a power plant (4).]]

{{Main|Nuclear fuel cycle}}

A nuclear reactor is only part of the fuel life-cycle for nuclear power. 
The process starts with mining (see ''[[Uranium mining]]''). 
Uranium mines are underground, [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]], or [[in-situ leach]] mines. 
In any case, the uranium ore is extracted, usually converted into a stable and compact form such as [[yellowcake]], and then transported to a processing facility. 
Here, the yellowcake is converted to [[uranium hexafluoride]], which is then generally [[uranium enrichment|enriched]] using various techniques. 
Some reactor designs can also use natural uranium without enrichment.
The enriched uranium, containing more than the natural 0.7% [[uranium-235]], is generally used to make [[Fuel rod#Common physical forms of nuclear fuel|rods]] of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for. 
In modern light-water reactors the fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles (typically 6 years total now) inside the reactor, generally until about 3% of their uranium has been fissioned, then they will be moved to a [[spent fuel pool]] where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away. 
After about 5 years in a spent fuel pool the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to handle, and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.

Some commentators have argued that this strengthens the case for [[Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|Nuclear power to be considered a renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2016/07/01/uranium-seawater-extraction-makes-nuclear-power-completely-renewable/#34e87e246e2a Uranium Seawater Extraction Makes Nuclear Power Completely Renewable.

===Breeding===
{{Main|Breeder reactor|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy}}
As opposed to light water reactors which use uranium-235 (0.7% of all natural uranium), fast breeder reactors use uranium-238 (99.3% of all natural uranium). In 2006 it was estimated that with seawater extraction, there was likely some five billion years' worth of uranium-238 for use in these power plants.&lt;ref name="stanford-cohen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |title=Facts From Cohen and Others |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=Stanford |year=2006 |author=John McCarthy |authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist) |website=Progress and its Sustainability |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410165316/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |archivedate=2007-04-10 |df= }} Citing Breeder reactors: A renewable energy source, ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'', vol.&amp;nbsp;51, (1), Jan.&amp;nbsp;1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breeder technology has been used in several reactors, but the high cost of reprocessing fuel safely, at 2006 technological levels, requires uranium prices of more than US$200/kg before becoming justified economically.&lt;ref name="wna-anpr"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf08.html |title=Advanced Nuclear Power Reactors |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |year=2006 |website=Information and Issue Briefs}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Breeder reactors are however being pursued as they have the potential to burn up all of the actinides in the present inventory of nuclear waste while also producing power and creating additional quantities of fuel for more reactors via the breeding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/p001515.pdf |title=Synergy between Fast Reactors and Thermal Breeders for Safe, Clean, and Sustainable Nuclear Power |website=World Energy Council |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110121245/http://worldenergy.org/documents/p001515.pdf |archive-date=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/are_fast-breeder_reactors_a_nuclear_power_panacea/2557/ |title=Are Fast-Breeder Reactors A Nuclear Power Panacea? by Fred Pearce: Yale Environment 360 |author=Rebecca Kessler |publisher=E360.yale.edu |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, there are only two breeder reactors producing commercial power: the [[BN-600 reactor]] and the [[BN-800 reactor]], both in Russia.&lt;ref name=WNAfast /&gt;
The BN-600, with a capacity of 600 MW, was built in 1980 in Beloyarsk and is planned to produce power until 2025.&lt;ref name=WNAfast&gt;{{cite web |title=Fast Neutron Reactors {{!}} FBR - World Nuclear Association |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/fast-neutron-reactors.aspx |website=www.world-nuclear.org |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The BN-800 is an updated version of the BN-600, and started operation in 2014 with a net electrical capacity of 789 MW.&lt;ref name=WNAfast/&gt;
The technical design of a yet larger breeder, the [[BN-1200 reactor]] was originally scheduled to be finalized in 2013, with construction slated for 2015 but has since been delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Large_fast_reactor_approved_for_Beloyarsk-2706124.html |title=Large fast reactor approved for Beloyarsk |publisher=World-nuclear-news.org |date=2012-06-27 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Phénix]] breeder reactor in France was powered down in 2009 after 36 years of operation.&lt;ref name=WNAfast /&gt;
Japan's [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju]] breeder reactor restarted (having been shut down in 1995) in 2010 for 3 months, but shut down again after equipment fell into the reactor during reactor checkups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201211090056 |title=Atomic agency plans to restart Monju prototype fast breeder reactor – AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |publisher=Ajw.asahi.com |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614042451/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201211090056 |archivedate=2013-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reactor was decommissioned in 2017.&lt;ref name=WNAfast/&gt;

Both China and India are building breeder reactors.

The [[China Experimental Fast Reactor]] began operating in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/business/2012-10/31/c_131942867.htm |title=China makes nuclear power development – Xinhua &amp;#124; English.news.cn |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative to fast breeders is thermal breeder reactors that use uranium-233 bred from [[thorium]] as fission fuel in the [[thorium fuel cycle]].&lt;ref name="wna-thorium"/&gt;
Thorium is about 3.5 times more common than uranium in the Earth's crust, and has different geographic characteristics.&lt;ref name="wna-thorium"/&gt;
This would extend the total practical fissionable resource base by 450%.&lt;ref name="wna-thorium"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf62.html |title=Thorium |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |year=2006 |website=Information and Issue Briefs}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[India's three-stage nuclear power programme]] features the use of a thorium fuel cycle in the third stage, as it has abundant thorium reserves but little uranium.&lt;ref name="wna-thorium"/&gt;

===Nuclear waste===
{{details|Radioactive waste}}
[[File:Spent Fuel Storage (25865854820).png|thumb|left| The lifecycle of fuel in the present US system]]
{{See also|List of nuclear waste treatment technologies}}
The most important waste stream from nuclear power plants is [[spent nuclear fuel]]. 
It is primarily composed of unconverted uranium as well as significant quantities of transuranic actinides (plutonium and [[curium]], mostly). 
In addition, about 3% of it is fission products from nuclear reactions. 
The actinides (uranium, plutonium, and curium) are responsible for the bulk of the long-term radioactivity, whereas the fission products are responsible for the bulk of the short-term radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;M. I. Ojovan, W.E. Lee. ''An Introduction to Nuclear Waste Immobilisation'', Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam, 315pp. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

====High-level radioactive waste====

High-level radioactive waste management concerns management and disposal of highly radioactive materials created during production of nuclear power. The technical issues in accomplishing this are daunting, due to the extremely long periods [[radioactive waste]]s remain deadly to living organisms. Of particular concern are two [[long-lived fission product]]s, [[Technetium-99]] (half-life 220,000 years) and [[Iodine-129]] (half-life 15.7 million years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoller-eser.com/Quarterlies/iodine.htm |title=Environmental Surveillance, Education and Research Program |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121041307/http://www.stoller-eser.com/Quarterlies/iodine.htm |archivedate=2008-11-21 |accessdate=2009-01-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which dominate spent nuclear fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years. The most troublesome [[Transuranium element|transuranic element]]s in spent fuel are [[Isotopes of neptunium|Neptunium-237]] (half-life two million years) and [[Plutonium-239]] (half-life 24,000 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vandenbosch|2007|p=21.|Ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, high-level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the [[biosphere]]. This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving permanent storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ojovan, M.

Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Brown, Paul| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/14/nuclear.greenpolitics|title=Shoot it at the sun.

Some proposed nuclear reactor designs however such as the American [[Integral Fast Reactor]] and the [[Molten salt reactor]] can use the nuclear waste from light water reactors as a fuel, transmutating it to isotopes that would be safe after hundreds, instead of tens of thousands of years.

Another possibility is the use of thorium in a reactor especially designed for thorium (rather than mixing in thorium with uranium and plutonium (i.e. in existing reactors). Used thorium fuel remains only a few hundreds of years radioactive, instead of tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;NWT magazine, October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the fraction of a radioisotope's atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half-life, the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human radioactive waste would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes (such as the decay chains of 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium which are [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each]] over the crust's 3 * 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; ton mass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sevior M. |title=Considerations for nuclear power in Australia |journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=859–872 |doi=10.1080/00207230601047255 |year=2006 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a767886528 |format=PDF |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Thorium%20Resources%20in%20%20Rare%20Earth%20Elements.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121218195159/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Thorium%20Resources%20in%20%20Rare%20Earth%20Elements.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-18|title=Thorium Resources In Rare Earth Elements|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2007, abstract #V33A-1161.

====Low-level radioactive waste====
{{See also|Low-level waste}}

The nuclear industry also produces a large volume of low-level radioactive waste in the form of contaminated items like clothing, hand tools, water purifier resins, and (upon decommissioning) the materials of which the reactor itself is built. Low-level waste can be stored on-site until radiation levels are low enough to be disposed as ordinary waste, or it can be sent to a low-level waste disposal site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NRC: Low-Level Waste |url=https://www.nrc.gov/waste/low-level-waste.html |website=www.nrc.gov |accessdate=28 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste relative to other types====
In countries with nuclear power, radioactive wastes account for less than 1% of total industrial toxic wastes, much of which remains hazardous for long periods.&lt;ref name="wna-wmitnfc" /&gt; Overall, nuclear power produces far less waste material by volume than fossil-fuel based power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/TheRisksOfNuclearPower|title=The Challenges of Nuclear Power}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal-burning plants are particularly noted for producing large amounts of toxic and mildly radioactive ash due to concentrating naturally occurring metals and mildly radioactive material from the coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=2007-12-13 |title=Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste |journal=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 report from [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] concluded that coal power actually results in more radioactivity being released into the environment than nuclear power operation, and that the population [[Effective dose (radiation safety)|effective dose]] equivalent, or dose to the public from radiation from coal plants is 100 times as much as from the operation of nuclear plants.&lt;ref name="colmain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |title=Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger |author=Alex Gabbard |date=2008-02-05 |website= |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |pages= |doi= |accessdate=2008-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205103749/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |archivedate=February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although coal ash is much less radioactive than spent nuclear fuel on a weight per weight basis, coal ash is produced in much higher quantities per unit of energy generated, and this is released directly into the environment as [[fly ash]], whereas nuclear plants use shielding to protect the environment from radioactive materials, for example, in [[dry cask storage]] vessels.&lt;ref name="cejournal"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2008-12-31 |title=Coal ash is ''not'' more radioactive than nuclear waste |url= http://www.cejournal.net/?p=410 |journal=CE Journal |pages= |doi= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827045039/http://www.cejournal.net/?p=410 |archivedate=2009-08-27 |dead-url=yes |accessdate= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste disposal====

Reprocessing can potentially recover up to 95% of the remaining uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel, putting it into new [[mixed oxide fuel]]. This produces a reduction in long term radioactivity within the remaining waste, since this is largely short-lived fission products, and reduces its volume by over 90%. Reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in Europe, Russia, Japan, and India. The full potential of reprocessing had not been achieved as of 2013 because it requires breeder reactors, which were not commercially available at that time.&lt;ref name=berrytoll/&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE Spectrum"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fairley |first1=Peter |title=Nuclear Wasteland |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/feb07/4891 |work=IEEE Spectrum |date=February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216161554/http://spectrum.ieee.org/print/4891# |archivedate=2007-02-16 |access-date=2007-04-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste, but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to [[nuclear proliferation]], the potential vulnerability to [[nuclear terrorism]], the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle. Several different methods for reprocessing been tried, but many have had safety and practicality problems which have led to their discontinuation.&lt;ref name=berrytoll&gt;R.

====Depleted uranium====
{{Main|Depleted uranium}}

Uranium enrichment produces large amounts of [[depleted uranium]] (DU), which consists of U-238 with most of the easily fissile U-235 isotope removed. 
U-238 is a tough metal with several commercial uses including aircraft production, radiation shielding, and armor, as it has a higher density than lead. 
Depleted uranium is also controversially used in munitions; DU penetrators (bullets or [[APFSDS]] tips) "self sharpen", due to uranium's tendency to fracture along shear bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4004-safe-alternative-to-depleted-uranium-revealed.html | title= 'Safe' alternative to depleted uranium revealed

==Accidents, attacks and safety==
Nuclear reactors have three unique characteristics that affect their safety, as compared to other power plants. First, a very large amount of [[Radionuclide|radioactive]] materials is present in a nuclear reactor. Their release to the environment could be hazardous. Second, a reactor has no "natural" power level. Rapid power increase is possible if the [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]] cannot be controlled. Third, the [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]] in the reactor continue to generate a significant amount of [[decay heat]] even after the chain reaction has stopped. If the heat cannot be removed from the reactor, the fuel rods may overheat and release radioactive materials. These three characteristics have to be [[Nuclear reactor safety system|taken into account]] when designing nuclear reactors. Multiple barriers separate the radioactive materials from the environment. Reactors are designed so that natural feedback mechanisms prevent an uncontrolled increase of the reactor power. Emergency cooling systems can remove the decay heat from the reactor in case the normal cooling systems fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ansn.iaea.org/ansn.org/Common/Documents/apmd/asia251p4.pdf|title=Basic principles of nuclear safety|last=Deitrich|first=L.W.|date=|website=|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents===
[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe crop.jpg|thumb|Following the 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], the world's worst [[nuclear accident]] since 1986, 50,000 households were displaced after [[radiation]] leaked into the air, soil and sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tomoko Yamazaki |author2=Shunichi Ozasa |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2011-06-27 |title=Fukushima Retiree Leads Anti-Nuclear Shareholders at Tepco Annual Meeting |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-26/fukushima-retiree-to-lead-anti-nuclear-motion.html |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation checks led to bans of some shipments of vegetables and fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mari Saito |date=2011-05-07 |title=Japan anti-nuclear protesters rally after PM call to close plant |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/07/us-japan-nuclear-idUSTRE74610J20110507 |work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{See also|Energy accidents|Nuclear safety|Nuclear and radiation accidents|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}

Some serious [[nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll|nuclear and radiation accidents]] have occurred. 
The severity of nuclear accidents is generally classified using the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES) introduced by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).
The scale ranks anomalous events or accidents on a scale from 0 (a deviation from normal operation that pose no safety risk) to 7 (a major accident with widespread effects). 
There have been 3 accidents of level 5 or higher in the civilian nuclear power industry, two of which, the [[Chernobyl accident]] and the [[Fukushima accident]], are ranked at level 7.
The [[Chernobyl accident]] in 1986 caused approximately 50 deaths from direct and indirect effects, and many more serious injuries.&lt;ref name=WHO2012&gt;{{cite web|date=23 April 2011|title=Chernobyl at 25th anniversary – Frequently Asked Questions – April 2011|publisher=World Health Organisation|accessdate=14 April 2012|url=http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/20110423_FAQs_Chernobyl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The exact death toll due to indirect effects of the widespread radiation contamination is difficult to measure, and depends on the assumptions used. 
Some studies put the total death toll of the Chernobyl accident from indirect effects much higher, in the order of thousands of people.
The [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident]] was caused by the [[2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami]]. 
The accident has not caused any radiation related deaths, but resulted in radioactive contamination of surrounding areas.
The difficult [[Fukushima disaster cleanup]] will take 40 or more years, and is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars.&lt;ref name="Richard Schiffman"&gt;{{cite news |author=Richard Schiffman |date=2013-03-12 |title=Two years on, America hasn't learned lessons of Fukushima nuclear disaster |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/12/fukushima-nuclear-accident-lessons-for-us |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin Fackler"&gt;{{cite news |author=Martin Fackler |date=2011-06-01 |title=Report Finds Japan Underestimated Tsunami Danger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/asia/02japan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979 was a smaller scale accident, rated at INES level 5. 
There were no direct or indirect deaths caused by the accident.&lt;ref name=timenuke/&gt;

Other less serious accidents are more common. [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] has reported that worldwide there have been 99 accidents (defined as either resulting in loss of human life or more than $50,000 of property damage) at nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=critev/&gt; 
Fifty-seven accidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and 57% (56 out of 99) of all nuclear-related accidents have occurred in the United States.&lt;ref name=critev&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benjamin K. Sovacool |date=August 2010 |title=A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a923050767~db=all~jumptype=rss |journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=393–400 |doi=10.1080/00472331003798350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military nuclear-powered submarine mishaps include the [[Soviet submarine K-19|K-19]] reactor accident (1961),&lt;ref name="rad"/&gt; the [[Soviet submarine K-27|K-27]] reactor accident (1968),&lt;ref name="johnston2007"/&gt; and the [[Soviet submarine K-431|K-431]] reactor accident (1985).&lt;ref name="timenuke"/&gt; 
International research is continuing into safety improvements such as passively safe plants,&lt;ref name="David Baurac 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | url= http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/hn/logos-winter02-psr.shtml | author=David Baurac | title=Passively safe reactors rely on nature to keep them cool| journal = Logos | volume=20 | issue =1 | year = 2002 | accessdate=2012-07-25 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the possible future use of nuclear fusion.

According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, fission energy accidents ranked first among energy sources in terms of their total economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage attributed to energy accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sovacool | first1 = B.

Another analysis presented in the international journal ''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' found that coal, oil, [[Liquid petroleum gas]] and hydroelectric accidents (primarily due to the [[Banqiao dam]] burst) have resulted in greater economic impacts than nuclear power accidents.&lt;ref name="tandfonline1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burgherr | first1 = P. | last2 = Hirschberg | first2 = S. | date = 2008 | title = A Comparative Analysis of Accident Risks in Fossil, Hydro, and Nuclear Energy Chains | url = http://gabe.web.psi.ch/pdfs/_2012_LEA_Audit/TA01.pdf | journal = Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 947 | doi = 10.1080/10807030802387556 }} Page 962 to 965.

This study does not include Fossil fuel related cancer and other indirect deaths created by the use of fossil fuel consumption in its "severe accident", an accident with more than 5 fatalities, classification.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power works under an [[insurance]] framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with the [[Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy|Paris convention on nuclear third-party liability]], the Brussels supplementary convention, the [[Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage|Vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Conventions/liability.html Publications: Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage]. [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act|Price-Anderson Act]] in the United States.
It is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity; but the cost is small, amounting to about 0.1% of the levelized cost of electricity, according to a CBO study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/05-02-nuclear.pdf Nuclear Power's Role in Generating Electricity] [[Congressional Budget Office]], May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
These beyond-regular-insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power, as [[hydroelectric power]] plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the [[Banqiao Dam]] disaster, where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died, or large [[dam failure]]s in general. As private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios, major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damsafety.org/media/Documents/FEMA/AvailabilityOfDamInsurance.pdf Availability of Dam Insurance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108185336/http://www.damsafety.org/media/documents/fema/availabilityofdaminsurance.pdf|date=2016-01-08}} 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
In terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated, nuclear power has caused fewer accidental deaths per unit of energy generated than all other major sources of energy generation. 
Energy produced by coal, petroleum, natural gas and [[hydropower]] has caused more deaths per unit of energy generated due to air pollution and [[energy accidents]]. 
This is found when comparing the immediate deaths from other energy sources to both the immediate nuclear related deaths from accidents&lt;ref name="without the hot air"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c24/page_168.shtml |title=Dr. MacKay ''Sustainable Energy without the hot air'' |website= Data from studies by the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] including non EU data |page= 168 |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also including the latent, or predicted, indirect cancer deaths from nuclear [[energy accidents]].&lt;ref name="theage2006"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/nuclear-power-cheaper-safer-than-coal-and-gas/2006/06/04/1149359609052.html | title= Nuclear power 'cheaper, safer' than coal and gas |author= Brendan Nicholson |date= 2006-06-05 |work= |publisher= [[The Age]] |pages= |doi= | accessdate= 2008-01-18 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tandfonline1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/ with and without Chernobyl's total predicted, by the [[Linear no-threshold]], cancer deaths included.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dennis Normile |date=2012-07-27 |title=Is Nuclear Power Good for You? |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/07/is-nuclear-power-good-for-you.html |journal=Science |page=395 |volume=337 |issue=6093 |doi=10.1126/science.337.6093.395-b |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EPZQYUB0?url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/07/is-nuclear-power-good-for-you.html |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced evacuation from a nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, even suicide. 
Such was the outcome of the 1986 [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] in Ukraine. 
A comprehensive 2005 study concluded that "the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date".&lt;ref name=riv12&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew C. Revkin |author-link=Andrew C.

[[Frank N. von Hippel]], an American scientist, commented on the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, saying that a disproportionate [[radiophobia]], or "fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas".&lt;ref name="Frank N. von Hippel 27–36"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/5/27.full |title=The radiological and psychological consequences of the Fukushima Daiichi accident |author= Frank N. von Hippel |date= September–October 2011 |volume= 67 |issue= 5 |journal= Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages= 27–36 |doi=10.1177/0096340211421588 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 2015 report in ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' explained that serious impacts of nuclear accidents were often not directly attributable to radiation exposure, but rather social and psychological effects. 
Evacuation and long-term displacement of affected populations created problems for many people, especially the elderly and hospital patients.&lt;ref&gt;Arifumi Hasegawa, Koichi Tanigawa, Akira Ohtsuru, Hirooki Yabe, Masaharu Maeda, Jun Shigemura, et al.

In January 2015, the number of Fukushima evacuees was around 119,000, compared with a peak of around 164,000 in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1710-ReportByTheDG-Web.pdf|title=The Fukushima Daiichi accident.

===Attacks and sabotage===
{{Main|Vulnerability of nuclear plants to attack|Nuclear terrorism|Nuclear safety in the United States}}
Terrorists could target [[nuclear power plant]]s in an attempt to release [[radioactive contamination]] into the community. The United States 9/11 Commission has said that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered for the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]. An attack on a reactor's [[spent fuel pool]] could also be serious, as these pools are less protected than the reactor core. The release of radioactivity could lead to thousands of near-term deaths and greater numbers of long-term fatalities.&lt;ref name=fas12&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/pubs/_docs/Nuclear_Energy_Report-lowres.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power in the United States |author1=Charles D. Ferguson |author2=Frank A. Settle |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012 |website=Federation of American Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If nuclear power use is to expand significantly, nuclear facilities will have to be made extremely safe from attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity. 
New reactor designs have features of [[Passive nuclear safety|passive safety]], such as the flooding of the reactor core without active intervention by reactor operators. 
However, these safety measures have generally been developed and studied with respect to accidents, not to the deliberate reactor attack by a terrorist group. 
The U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) does now also require new reactor license applications to consider security during the design stage.&lt;ref name=fas12/&gt; 
In the United States, the NRC carries out "Force on Force" (FOF) exercises at all Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) sites at least once every three years.&lt;ref name=fas12/&gt; 
In the United States, plants are surrounded by a double row of tall fences which are electronically monitored.

Insider sabotage is also a threat because insiders can observe and work around security measures.

A fire caused 5–10 million dollars worth of damage to New York's [[Indian Point Energy Center]] in 1971.

Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that they can be used to make [[nuclear weapon]]s if a country chooses to do so. When this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to a nuclear weapon or a public annex to a "secret" weapons program. The concern over [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear activities]] is a case in point.&lt;ref name=dfall2009&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nuclear power without nuclear proliferation? |author1=Steven E. Miller |author2=Scott D. Sagan |lastauthoramp=yes |date=Fall 2009 |journal=Dædalus |doi=10.1162/daed.2009.138.4.7 |volume=138 |issue=4 |page=7 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2012 there were [[Nuclear power by country|thirty one countries]] that have civil nuclear power plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf01.html |title=Nuclear Power in the World Today |publisher=World-nuclear.org |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nine have nuclear weapons]], with the vast majority of these [[nuclear weapons state]]s having first produced weapons, before commercial fission electricity stations. 
Moreover, the re-purposing of civilian nuclear industries for military purposes would be a breach of the [[Non-proliferation treaty]], of which 190 countries adhere to.

A fundamental goal for global security is to minimize the nuclear proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power.&lt;ref name=dfall2009/&gt; 
The [[Global Nuclear Energy Partnership]] is an international effort to create a distribution network in which developing countries in need of energy would receive [[nuclear fuel]] at a discounted rate, in exchange for that nation agreeing to forgo their own indigenous develop of a uranium enrichment program. 
The France-based [[Eurodif]]/''European Gaseous Diffusion Uranium Enrichment Consortium'' is a program that successfully implemented this concept, with [[Nuclear power in Spain|Spain]] and other countries without enrichment facilities buying a share of the fuel produced at the French controlled enrichment facility, but without a transfer of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Conversion-Enrichment-and-Fabrication/Uranium-Enrichment/|title=Uranium Enrichment - Enrichment of uranium - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Iran was an early participant from 1974, and remains a shareholder of Eurodif via [[Sofidif]].

According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, a "number of high-ranking officials, even within the United Nations, have argued that they can do little to stop states using nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons".&lt;ref name=bks2011/&gt; 
A 2009 United Nations report said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies, which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=bks2011&gt;{{cite book |last=Sovacool |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin K.

On the other hand, power reactors can also reduce nuclear weapons arsenals when military grade nuclear materials are reprocessed to be used as fuel in nuclear power plants.

Up to 2005, the Megatons to Megawatts Program had processed $8 billion of high enriched, weapons grade uranium into [[low enriched uranium]] suitable as nuclear fuel for commercial fission reactors by diluting it with [[natural uranium]].
This corresponds to the elimination of 10,000 nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usec.com/news/megatons-megawatts-eliminates-equivalent-10000-nuclear-warheads |title=Megatons to Megawatts Eliminates Equivalent of 10,000 Nuclear Warheads |publisher=Usec.com |date=2005-09-21 |accessdate=2013-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426130245/http://www.usec.com/news/megatons-megawatts-eliminates-equivalent-10000-nuclear-warheads |archivedate=2013-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
For approximately two decades, this material generated nearly 10 percent of all the electricity consumed in the United States (about half of all U.S. nuclear electricity generated) with a total of around 7 trillion [[kilowatt-hours]] of electricity produced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dawn Stover |date=2014-02-21 |title=More megatons to megawatts |url=http://thebulletin.org/more-megatons-megawatts |journal=The Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enough energy to energize the entire United States electric grid for about two years.&lt;ref name="A Farewell to Arms, 2014"/&gt; In total it is estimated to have cost $17 billion, a "bargain for US ratepayers", with Russia profiting $12 billion from the deal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Much needed profit for the [[Rosatom|Russian nuclear oversight industry]], which after the collapse of the [[Soviet economy]], had difficulties paying for the maintenance and security of the Russian Federations highly enriched uranium and warheads.&lt;ref name="A Farewell to Arms, 2014"/&gt;

The Megatons to Megawatts Program was hailed as a major success by anti-nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of nuclear weapons worldwide since the cold war ended.&lt;ref name="thebulletin.org"/&gt; 
However without an increase in nuclear reactors and greater demand for fissile fuel, the cost of dismantling and down blending has dissuaded Russia from continuing their disarmament.
As of 2013 Russia appears to not be interested in extending the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2009-12-05 |title=Future Unclear For 'Megatons To Megawatts' Program |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121125743 |work=All Things Considered |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power is one of the leading [[low carbon power generation]] methods of producing [[electricity]], and in terms of [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|total life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy generated]], has emission values comparable to or lower than [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="Nrel.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_results.html Life Cycle Assessment Harmonization Results and Findings.Figure 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506114117/http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_results.html |date=2017-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2014 analysis of the [[carbon footprint]] literature by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) reported that the embodied [[Life cycle assessment|total life-cycle]] [[emission intensity]] of fission electricity has a median value of 12 g {{CO2}}[[carbon dioxide equivalent|eq]]/[[kilowatt-hour|kWh]] which is the lowest out of all commercial [[baseload]] energy sources.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf |title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II I: Technology – specific cost and performance parameters |year=2014 |publisher=IPCC |page=10 |accessdate=2014-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215013236/http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="report.mitigation2014.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-ii.pdf |title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II Metrics and Methodology. pg 37 to 40,41 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908235241/http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-ii.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of [[nuclear power station|fission-electric power station]] commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power prevented the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels in [[thermal power station]]s.&lt;ref name="Kharecha Pushker A 2013 4889–4895"/&gt;

===Radiation===
According to the United Nations ([[UNSCEAR]]), regular nuclear power plant operation including the nuclear fuel cycle causes radioisotope releases into the environment amounting to 0.0002 [[millisievert]]s (mSv) per year of public exposure as a global average.&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_GA&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/09-86753_Report_2008_GA_Report_corr2.pdf |title=UNSCEAR 2008 Report to the General Assembly |publisher=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is small compared to variation in natural [[background radiation]], which averages 2.4&amp;nbsp;mSv/a globally but frequently varies between 1&amp;nbsp;mSv/a and 13&amp;nbsp;mSv/a depending on a person's location as determined by UNSCEAR.&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_GA/&gt; 
As of a 2008 report, the remaining legacy of the worst nuclear power plant accident (Chernobyl) is 0.002&amp;nbsp;mSv/a in global average exposure (a figure which was 0.04&amp;nbsp;mSv per person averaged over the entire populace of the Northern Hemisphere in the year of the accident in 1986, although far higher among the most affected local populations and recovery workers).&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_GA/&gt;

===Waste heat===
{{See also|Environmental impact of nuclear power#Waste heat}}
[[Climate change]] causing weather extremes such as [[heat waves]], reduced precipitation levels and [[droughts]] can have a significant impact on all [[thermal power station]] infrastructure, including large biomass-electric and fission-electric stations alike, if cooling in these power stations, namely in the [[steam condenser]] is provided by certain [[freshwater]] sources.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Dr. Frauke Urban and Dr. Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=2012-09-20 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; While many thermal stations use indirect seawater cooling or [[cooling tower]]s that in comparison use little to no freshwater, those that were designed to [[heat sink|heat exchange]] with rivers and lakes, can run into economic problems.

This presently infrequent generic problem may become increasingly significant over time.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; This can force nuclear reactors to be shut down, as happened in France during the 2003 and 2006 heat waves. Nuclear power supply was severely diminished by low river flow rates and droughts, which meant rivers had reached the maximum temperatures for cooling reactors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; During the heat waves, 17 reactors had to limit output or shut down. 77% of French electricity is produced by nuclear power and in 2009 a similar situation created a 8GW shortage and forced the French government to import electricity.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Other cases have been reported from Germany, where extreme temperatures have reduced nuclear power production only 9 times due to high temperatures between 1979 and 2007.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; 

If global warming continues, this disruption is likely to increase or alternatively, station operators could instead retro-fit other means of cooling, like [[cooling towers]], despite these frequently being large structures and therefore sometimes unpopular with the public.

==Comparison with renewable energy==
{{See also|Renewable energy debate|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|100% renewable energy|Cost of electricity by source}}
There is an ongoing debate on the relative benefits of nuclear power compared to renewable energy sources for the generation of low-carbon electricity.
Proponents of renewable energy argue that wind power and solar power are already cheaper and safer than nuclear power.
Nuclear power proponents argue that renewable energy sources such as wind and solar do not offer the scalability necessary for a large scale decarbonization of the electric grid, mainly due to their intermittency.&lt;ref name=Kloor&gt;{{cite news |last=Kloor |first=Keith |date=2013-01-11 |title=The Pro-Nukes Environmental Movement |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/nuclear_power/2013/01/nuclear_energy_and_climate_change_environmentalists_debate_how_to_stop_global.html |work=Slate.com "The Big Questions" Blog |publisher=The Slate Group |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smil |first=Vaclav |date=2012-06-28 |title=A Skeptic Looks at Alternative Energy |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/a-skeptic-looks-at-alternative-energy/0 |journal=IEEE Spectrum |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the majority of installed renewable energy across the world is currently in the form of [[hydro power]], solar and wind power are growing at a much higher pace, especially in developed countries.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Several studies report that it is in principle possible to cover most of energy generation with renewable sources.
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has said that if governments were supportive, and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed, renewable energy supply could account for almost 80% of the world's energy use within forty years with a necessary investment in renewables of about 1% of global GDP annually.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite news |author=Fiona Harvey |date=2011-05-09 |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.&lt;ref name=ipccccc/&gt;

However, other studies suggest that solar and wind energy are not cost-effective compared to nuclear power.
The [[Brookings Institution]] published ''The Net Benefits of Low and No-Carbon Electricity Technologies'' in 2014 which states, after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis, that "The net benefits of new nuclear, hydro, and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants", with the most cost effective low carbon power technology being determined to be nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21608646-wind-and-solar-power-are-even-more-expensive-commonly-thought-sun-wind-and|title=Sun, wind and drain|publisher=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Net-Benefits-Final.pdf|title=The net benefits of low and no-carbon electricity technologies |date= May 2014 |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] | author=Charles Frank }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/6317|title=Comparing the Costs of Intermittent and Dispatchable Electricity-Generating Technologies|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date=September 2011 |author= Paul Joskow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power is also proposed as a tested and practical way to implement a low-carbon energy infrastructure, as opposed to renewable sources.
Analysis in 2015 by professor and chair of Environmental Sustainability [[Barry Brook (scientist)|Barry W. Brook]] and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely, from the electric grid of the world, has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in France and Sweden during each nation's building programs in the 1980s, nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely within 10 years, "allow[ing] the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets.".&lt;ref name="journals.plos.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Potential for Worldwide Displacement of Fossil-Fuel Electricity by Nuclear Energy in Three Decades Based on Extrapolation of Regional Deployment Data|first1=Staffan A.|last1=Qvist|first2=Barry W.|last2=Brook|date=13 May 2015|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=5|pages=e0124074|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124074|pmid=25970621|pmc=4429979}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a similar analysis, Brook had earlier determined that 50% of all [[world energy consumption|global energy]], that is not solely electricity, but transportation [[synthetic fuels]] etc. could be generated within approximately 30 years, if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nation's already proven installation rates in units of installed [[nameplate capacity]], [[Gigawatt|GW]] per year, per unit of global [[GDP]] (GW/year/$).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511009189 | doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2011.11.041 | volume=42 | title=Could nuclear fission energy, etc., solve the greenhouse problem?

As Brook notes, the "principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical, economic or fuel-related, but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance, fiscal and political inertia, and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing [the other] low-carbon alternatives."&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

Several studies conclude that wind and solar power have costs that are comparable or lower than nuclear power, when considering price per kWh.
The cost of constructing established nuclear power reactor designs has followed an increasing trend due to [[regulation]]s and [[court cases]] whereas the [[LCOE|levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE) is declining for wind and solar power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eetd.lbl.gov/ea/ems/reports/wind-energy-costs-2-2012.pdf ] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121021062622/http://eetd.lbl.gov/ea/ems/reports/wind-energy-costs-2-2012.pdf |date=October 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2010 a report from Solar researchers at Duke University found that solar power may be already cheaper than new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powers|first1=Diana S.|title=Nuclear Energy Loses Cost Advantage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/business/global/27iht-renuke.html|work=The New York Times|date=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ncwarn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncwarn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/NCW-SolarReport_final1.pdf |title=Solar and Nuclear Costs — The Historic Crossover |date=July 2010 |website=NC WARN |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2017}} 
However they state that if subsidies were removed for solar power, the crossover point would be delayed by years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news200578033.html |title=Is solar power cheaper than nuclear power? |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data from the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) in 2011 estimated that in 2016, solar will have a levelized cost of electricity almost twice as expensive as nuclear (21¢/kWh for solar, 11.39¢/kWh for nuclear), and wind somewhat less expensive than nuclear (9.7¢/kWh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/aeo/electricity_generation.html |title=Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2011 |date=November 2010 |website=U.S. Energy Information Administration |accessdate=2013-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104092151/http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/aeo/electricity_generation.html |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the EIA has also cautioned that levelized costs of intermittent sources such as wind and solar are not directly comparable to costs of "dispatchable" sources (those that can be adjusted to meet demand), as intermittent sources need costly large-scale back-up power supplies for when the weather changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/conference/2013/pdf/presentations/namovicz.pdf |title=Assessing the Economic Value of New Utility-Scale Renewable Generation Projects |author=Chris Namovicz |date=2013-06-17 |website=US Energy Information Administration Energy Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by the Global Subsidies Initiative compared global relative [[energy subsidies]], or government financial aid for the deployment of different energy sources.
Results show that fossil fuels receive about 1 U.S. cents per kWh of energy they produce, nuclear energy receives 1.7 cents / kWh, renewable energy (excluding hydroelectricity) receives 5.0 cents / kWh and biofuels receive 5.1 cents / kWh in subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/relative_energy_subsidies.pdf |title= Relative Subsidies to Energy Sources: GSI estimates 19 APRIL 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130513055956/http://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/relative_energy_subsidies.pdf |archivedate= 13 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/eia-releases-new-subsidy-report-subsidies-for-renewables-increase-186-percent/|title=Press release: EIA Releases New Subsidy Report: Subsidies for Renewables Increase 186 Percent - IER|date=3 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power is comparable to, and in some cases lower, than many renewable energy sources in terms of lives lost per unit of electricity delivered.&lt;ref name="MarkandyaWilkinson2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="without the hot air"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Starfelt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manhaz.cyf.gov.pl/manhaz/strona_konferencja_EAE-2001/15%20-%20Polenp~1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230434/http://manhaz.cyf.gov.pl/manhaz/strona_konferencja_EAE-2001/15%20-%20Polenp~1.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |title=Economic Analysis of Various Options of Electricity Generation – Taking into Account Health and Environmental Effects |author1=Nils Starfelt |author2=Carl-Erik Wikdahl |accessdate=2012-09-08 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, as opposed to renewable energy, conventional designs for nuclear reactors produce intensely radioactive spent fuel that needs to be stored or reprocessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Biello |date=2009-01-28 |title=Spent Nuclear Fuel: A Trash Heap Deadly for 250,000 Years or a Renewable Energy Source? |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nuclear-waste-lethal-trash-or-renewable-energy-source |journal=Scientific American |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A nuclear plant also needs to be disassembled and removed and much of the disassembled nuclear plant needs to be stored as low level nuclear waste for a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/yearbook/2012/pdfs/UYB_2012_CH_3.pdf |title=Closing and Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants |date=2012-03-07 |website=United Nations Environment Programme |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518164428/http://www.unep.org/yearbook/2012/pdfs/UYB_2012_CH_3.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear decommissioning==
{{main|nuclear decommissioning}}
The financial costs of every nuclear power plant continues for some time after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Once no longer economically viable, nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses, such as [[greenfield status]]. 
After a cooling-off period that may last decades, reactor core materials are dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for interim storage or [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] experiments. The consensus on how to approach the task is one that is relatively inexpensive, but it has the potential to be hazardous to the natural environment as it presents opportunities for [[human error]], accidents or sabotage.&lt;ref name=sov11/&gt;

In the United States a [[Nuclear Waste Policy Act]] and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund is legally required, with utilities banking 0.1 to 0.2 cents/kWh during operations to fund future decommissioning. They must report regularly to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) on the status of their decommissioning funds. About 70% of the total estimated cost of decommissioning all U.S. nuclear power reactors has already been collected (on the basis of the average cost of $320 million per reactor-steam turbine unit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/decommissioning-nuclear-facilities.aspx|title=Nuclear Decommissioning: Decommission nuclear facilities - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/decommissioning.html|title=Backgrounder on Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants. NRC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in 2011, there are 13 reactors that had permanently shut down and are in some phase of decommissioning.&lt;ref name=sov11&gt;{{cite book |last=Sovacool |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin K. Sovacool |date=2011 |title=Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |location=Hackensack, NJ |pages=118–119 |isbn=978-981-4322-75-1|title-link=Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power }}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant]] and [[Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station]] having completed the process in 2006–2007, after ceasing commercial electricity production circa 1992. 
The majority of the 15 years, was used to allow the station to naturally cool-down on its own, which makes the manual disassembly process both safer and cheaper.
Decommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time-consuming.

Proponents of nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a [[sustainable energy]] source that reduces [[carbon emissions]] and increases [[energy security]] by decreasing dependence on imported energy sources.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=aXb5iuqdZoD4&amp;refer=us U.S. Energy Legislation May Be 'Renaissance' for Nuclear Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626182130/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103 |date=2009-06-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Nuclear power in space}}
Both [[Nuclear fission|fission]] and fusion appear promising for [[Spacecraft propulsion|space propulsion]] applications, generating higher mission velocities with less [[reaction mass]]. This is due to the much higher energy density of nuclear reactions: some 7 orders of magnitude (10,000,000 times) more energetic than the chemical reactions which power the current generation of rockets.

[[Radioactive decay]] has been used on a relatively small scale (few kW), mostly to power [[space mission]]s and experiments by using [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s such as those developed at [[Idaho National Laboratory#Space and Security Power Systems Facility|Idaho National Laboratory]].

==Research==

===Advanced fission reactor designs===
{{Main|Generation IV reactor}}
[[File:GenIVRoadmap-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Generation IV roadmap from [[Argonne National Laboratory]]]]
Current fission reactors in operation around the world are [[generation II reactor|second]] or [[generation III reactor|third generation]] systems, with most of the first-generation systems having been already retired. 
Research into advanced [[generation IV reactor]] types was officially started by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals, including to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste, improve natural resource utilization, the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity, and decrease the cost to build and run such plants. 
Most of these reactors differ significantly from current operating light water reactors, and are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://ossfoundation.us/projects/energy/nuclear |title=4th Generation Nuclear Power — OSS Foundation |publisher=Ossfoundation.us |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One disadvantage of any new reactor technology is that safety risks may be greater initially as reactor operators have little experience with the new design. 
Nuclear engineer [[David Lochbaum]] has explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents have occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology. 
He argues that "the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold: scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations; and humans make mistakes".&lt;ref name=safe/&gt; 
As one director of a U.S. research laboratory put it, "fabrication, construction, operation, and maintenance of new reactors will face a steep learning curve: advanced technologies will have a heightened risk of accidents and mistakes. The technology may be proven, but people are not".&lt;ref name=safe&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benjamin K.

===Hybrid nuclear fusion-fission===
{{main|Nuclear fusion–fission hybrid}}
Hybrid nuclear power is a proposed means of generating power by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by [[Hans Bethe]] during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to delays in the realization of pure fusion. When a sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built, it has the potential to be capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission fuel, reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude, and more importantly, eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel, substances which cause security concerns.&lt;ref name="hybrid"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gerstner, E. | title = Nuclear energy: The hybrid returns | year = 2009 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 460 | issue = 7251| pages = 25–8 | pmid = 19571861|doi=10.1038/460025a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090701/pdf/460025a.pdf | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These reactions appear potentially viable, though technically quite difficult and have yet to be created on a scale that could be used in a functional power plant. 
Fusion power has been under theoretical and experimental investigation since the 1950s.

Several experimental nuclear fusion reactors and facilities exist. 
The largest and most ambitious international nuclear fusion project currently in progress is [[ITER]], a large [[tokamak]] under construction in France.
ITER is planned to pave the way for commercial fusion power by demonstrating self-sustained nuclear fusion reactions with positive energy gain. 
Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns. 
The facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year 2027 – 11 years after initially anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W Wayt Gibbs |date=2013-12-30 |title=Triple-threat method sparks hope for fusion |url=http://www.nature.com/news/triple-threat-method-sparks-hope-for-fusion-1.14445 |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow on commercial nuclear fusion power station, [[DEMOnstration Power Station|DEMO]], has been proposed.&lt;ref name="ITERorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm |title=Beyond ITER |publisher=Information Services, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory |website=The ITER Project |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107220145/http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm |archivedate=2006-11-07 |accessdate=2011-02-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }} – Projected fusion power timeline&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EFDA_Activities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt |title=Overview of EFDA Activities |website=[[European Fusion Development Agreement|EFDA]] |publisher=[[European Fusion Development Agreement]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001123645/http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt |archivedate=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2006-11-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also suggestions for a power plant based upon a different fusion approach, that of an [[inertial fusion power plant]].

Fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable, as fission-electric power had been. However, the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and [[plasma containment]] led to projections being extended by several decades. In 2010, more than 60 years after the first attempts, commercial power production was still believed to be unlikely before 2050.&lt;ref name="ITERorg" /&gt;

'''PetroSkills''' is a competency based training provider for the Oil and Gas Industry that offers training in disciplines that range from [[upstream (petroleum industry)|upstream]], [[downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]], to [[occupational safety and health]].  PetroSkills was founded in 1963 and is based out of Tulsa, Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of PetroSkills LLC|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=31072180|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 PetroSkills began the [[PetroSkills Alliance]] by partnering with BP and Shell to involve large oil and gas companies directly into the design of course material, instructor review, and competency analysis.

In 2008 PetroSkills expanded their number of courses through the acquisition of PetrEX International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PetroSkills Snags New Drilling Training, Consulting Company|url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=65040|publisher=RigZone|date=2008-08-04|accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 PetroSkills was acquired by BV Investment Partners. Previous owners, Ford Brett and Dennis Wing retained a minority ownership position during the acquisition. BV partner Justin Harrison was quoted as saying, "We share management's view that long-term demand drivers for oil and gas resources, the increasing technological complexity of finding and extracting oil and gas, and a demographic shift in the industry's workforce composition will drive a growing and sustainable need for quality technical training and competency-based solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marino |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/bv-investment-partners-petroskills-211433-1.html |title=Mergers &amp; Acquisitions |publisher=Themiddlemarket.com |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Also in 2010 PetroSkills partnered with the [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]] and began providing training to operations and maintenance technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petrocomputing.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/petroskills-announces-new-om-jv/ |title=PetroSkills Announces New O&amp;M JV " PetroComputing |publisher=Petrocomputing.wordpress.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership was a "response to the bigger crew change that will be occurring across operator ranks over the next decade. The demographic changes impacting the engineering ranks within E&amp;P represent a small percentage of the numbers that will be impacted in the operations and maintenance ranks.” With the introduction of PetroSkills O&amp;M, a specific focus was placed on both operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) technicians employed in upstream, midstream and downstream roles, PetroSkills O&amp;M offers companies training through both instructor-led training and e-learning content.

In 2011 PetroSkills opened its own 325,000 square foot Conference Center on January 14.  The center is located in Katy, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katyconfidential.com/2011/08/petroskills/ |title=PetroSkills Conference Center |publisher=Katy Confidential |date=2011-08-11 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011 PetroSkills launched PetroCore, a browser-based application offering technical professionals in the oil and gas industry anytime, online access to PetroSkills course materials and other technical knowledge resources.

In 2012 PetroSkills opened a training facility in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/3496/news/read/647737/1.html |title=Minister of Energy Opens Regional Office for PetroSkills |publisher=Al Wasat News |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2012, PetroSkills announced that it acquired John M. Campbell &amp; Co., a training provider that's focus was heavily on the facilities side of the Oil and Gas industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/122508/PetroSkills_Acquires_Training_Consulting_Businesses |title=PetroSkills Acquires Training, Consulting Businesses |publisher=RigZone |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physical oceanography''' is the study of [[physics|physical]] conditions and physical processes within the [[ocean]], especially the motions and physical properties of ocean waters.

Physical oceanography is one of several sub-domains into which [[oceanography]] is divided. Others include [[Marine biology|biological]], [[chemical oceanography|chemical]] and [[Marine geology|geological]] oceanography.

Physical oceanography may be subdivided into ''descriptive'' and ''dynamical'' physical oceanography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/784140610|title=Descriptive physical oceanography : an introduction|last=D.,|first=Talley, Lynne|last2=L.,|first2=Pickard, George|last3=J.,|first3=Emery, William|last4=(Oceanographer),|first4=Swift, James H.|isbn=9780750645522|oclc=784140610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptive physical oceanography seeks to research the ocean through observations and complex numerical models, which describe the fluid motions as precisely as possible.

Dynamical physical oceanography  focuses primarily upon the processes that govern the motion of fluids with emphasis upon theoretical research and numerical models. These are part of the large field of [[Geophysical fluid dynamics|Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD)]] that is shared together with [[meteorology]]. GFD is a sub field of [[Fluid dynamics]]  describing flows occurring on spatial and temporal scales that are greatly influenced by the [[Coriolis force]].

Roughly 97% of the planet's water is in its oceans, and the oceans are the source of the vast majority of [[water vapor]] that condenses in the atmosphere and falls as [[rain]] or [[snow]] on the continents.&lt;ref name="Pinet1996"&gt;{{cite book |title=Invitation to Oceanography |last=Pinet |first=Paul R. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=West Publishing Co. |edition=3rd |location=St. Paul, MN |isbn=0-7637-2136-0 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamblin1998"&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth's Dynamic Systems |last=Hamblin |first=W.

The oceans are far deeper than the [[continent]]s are tall; examination of the Earth's [[hypsographic curve]] shows that the average elevation of Earth's landmasses is only {{convert|840|m|ft}}, while the ocean's average depth is {{convert|3800|m|ft}}. Though this apparent discrepancy is great, for both land and sea, the respective extremes such as [[mountains]] and [[trenches]] are rare.&lt;ref name="Pinet1996" /&gt;

==Temperature, salinity and density==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
&lt;!-- These two images cause clutter at present; section expansion may improve their relevance [[File:WOA05 sea-surf TMP AYool.png|thumb|200px|[[World Ocean Atlas|WOA]] surface temperature.]]
[[File:WOA09 sea-surf SAL AYool.png|thumb|200px|[[World Ocean Atlas|WOA]] surface salinity.]] --&gt;
[[File:WOA09 sea-surf DEN AYool.png|thumb|200px|[[World Ocean Atlas|WOA]] surface density.]]

Because the vast majority of the world ocean's volume is deep water, the mean temperature of seawater is low; roughly 75% of the ocean's volume has a temperature from 0° – 5&amp;nbsp;°C (Pinet 1996). The same percentage falls in a salinity range between 34–35 ppt (3.4–3.5%) (Pinet 1996). There is still quite a bit of variation, however. Surface temperatures can range from below freezing near the poles to 35&amp;nbsp;°C in restricted tropical seas, while salinity can vary from 10 to 41 ppt (1.0–4.1%).&lt;ref name="Marshak2001"&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth: Portrait of a Planet |last=Marshak |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn=0-393-97423-5 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vertical structure of the temperature can be divided into three basic layers, a surface [[mixed layer]], where gradients are low, a [[thermocline]] where gradients are high, and a poorly stratified abyss.

In terms of temperature, the ocean's layers are highly [[latitude]]-dependent; the [[thermocline]] is pronounced in the tropics, but nonexistent in polar waters (Marshak 2001). The [[halocline]] usually lies near the surface, where evaporation raises salinity in the tropics, or meltwater dilutes it in polar regions.&lt;ref name="Marshak2001" /&gt; These variations of salinity and temperature with depth change the density of the seawater, creating the [[pycnocline]].&lt;ref name="Pinet1996" /&gt;

==Circulation==
{{main|Ocean current}}
[[Image:Thermohaline Circulation 2.png|thumb|250px|right|Density-driven thermohaline circulation]]
Energy for the ocean circulation (and for the atmospheric circulation) comes from solar radiation and gravitational energy from the sun and moon.&lt;ref&gt;Munk, W. and Wunsch, C., 1998: Abyssal recipes II: energetics of tidal and wind mixing. Deep-Sea Research Part I, 45, pp. 1977--2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The amount of sunlight absorbed at the surface varies strongly with latitude, being greater at the equator than at the poles, and this engenders fluid motion in both the atmosphere and ocean that acts to redistribute heat from the equator towards the poles, thereby reducing the temperature gradients that would exist in the absence of fluid motion. Perhaps three quarters of this heat is carried in the atmosphere; the rest is carried in the ocean.

The atmosphere is heated from below, which leads to convection, the largest expression of which is the [[Hadley circulation]]. By contrast the ocean is heated from above, which tends to suppress convection. Instead ocean deep water is formed in polar regions where cold salty waters sink in fairly restricted areas. This is the beginning of the [[thermohaline circulation]].

Oceanic currents are largely driven by the surface wind stress; hence the large-scale [[atmospheric circulation]] is important to understanding the ocean circulation. The Hadley circulation leads to Easterly winds in the tropics and Westerlies in mid-latitudes. This leads to slow equatorward flow throughout most of a subtropical ocean basin (the [[Sverdrup balance]]). The return flow occurs in an intense, narrow, poleward [[western boundary current]]. Like the atmosphere, the ocean is far wider than it is deep, and hence horizontal motion is in general much faster than vertical motion. In the southern hemisphere there is a continuous belt of ocean, and hence the mid-latitude westerlies force the strong [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]]. In the northern hemisphere the land masses prevent this and the ocean circulation is broken into smaller [[gyre]]s in the Atlantic and Pacific basins.

===Coriolis effect===
The [[Coriolis effect]] results in a deflection of fluid flows (to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere). This has profound effects on the flow of the oceans. In particular it means the flow goes ''around'' high and low pressure systems, permitting them to persist for long periods of time. As a result, tiny variations in pressure can produce measurable currents. A slope of one part in one million in sea surface height, for example, will result in a current of 10&amp;nbsp;cm/s at mid-latitudes. The fact that the Coriolis effect is largest at the poles and weak at the equator results in sharp, relatively steady western boundary currents which are absent on eastern boundaries. Also see [[secondary circulation]] effects.

===Ekman transport===
[[Ekman transport]] results in the net transport of surface water 90 degrees to the right of the wind in the Northern Hemisphere, and 90 degrees to the left of the wind in the Southern Hemisphere. As the wind blows across the surface of the ocean, it "grabs" onto a thin layer of the surface water. In turn, that thin sheet of water transfers motion energy to the thin layer of water under it, and so on. However, because of the Coriolis Effect, the direction of travel of the layers of water slowly move farther and farther to the right as they get deeper in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. In most cases, the very bottom layer of water affected by the wind is at a depth of 100 m – 150 m and is traveling about 180 degrees, completely opposite of the direction that the wind is blowing. Overall, the net transport of water would be 90 degrees from the original direction of the wind.

===Langmuir circulation===
[[Langmuir circulation]] results in the occurrence of thin, visible stripes, called [[windrows]] on the surface of the ocean parallel to the direction that the wind is blowing. If the wind is blowing with more than 3&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, it can create parallel windrows alternating upwelling and downwelling about 5–300&amp;nbsp;m apart. These windrows are created by adjacent ovular water cells (extending to about {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep) alternating rotating clockwise and counterclockwise. In the [[Convergence zone|convergence]] zones debris, foam and seaweed accumulates, while at the [[divergence]] zones plankton are caught and carried to the surface. If there are many plankton in the divergence zone fish are often attracted to feed on them.

===Ocean–atmosphere interface===
[[Image:Isabel 091503bm.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Hurricane Isabel]] east of the Bahamas on 15 September 2003 ]]
At the ocean-atmosphere interface, the ocean and atmosphere exchange fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum.

; Heat
The important [[heat]] terms at the surface are the sensible heat [[flux]], the latent heat flux, the incoming [[solar radiation]] and the balance of long-wave ([[infrared]]) [[radiation]]. In general, the tropical oceans will tend to show a net gain of heat, and the polar oceans a net loss, the result of a net transfer of energy polewards in the oceans.

The oceans' large heat capacity moderates the climate of areas adjacent to the oceans, leading to a [[maritime climate]] at such locations. This can be a result of heat storage in summer and release in winter; or of transport of heat from warmer locations: a particularly notable example of this is [[Western Europe]], which is heated at least in part by the [[gulf stream|north atlantic drift]].

;Momentum
Surface winds tend to be of order meters per second; ocean currents of order centimeters per second. Hence from the point of view of the atmosphere, the ocean can be considered effectively stationary; from the point of view of the ocean, the atmosphere imposes a significant wind [[stress (physics)|stress]] on its surface, and this forces large-scale currents in the ocean.

Through the wind stress, the wind generates [[ocean surface wave]]s; the longer waves have a [[phase velocity]] tending towards the [[wind speed]]. [[Momentum]] of the surface winds is transferred into the energy [[flux]] by the ocean surface waves. The increased [[surface roughness|roughness]] of the ocean surface, by the presence of the waves, changes the wind near the surface.

;Moisture
The ocean can gain [[moisture]] from [[rainfall]], or lose it through [[evaporation]]. Evaporative loss leaves the ocean saltier; the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Persian Gulf]] for example have strong evaporative loss; the resulting plume of dense salty water may be traced through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. At one time, it was believed that [[evaporation]]/[[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] was a major driver of ocean currents; it is now known to be only a very minor factor.

===Planetary waves===
;Kelvin Waves
{{main|Kelvin wave}}
A [[Kelvin wave]] is any [[wave|progressive wave]] that is channeled between two boundaries or opposing forces (usually between the [[Coriolis force]] and a [[coastline]] or the [[equator]]). There are two types, coastal and equatorial. Kelvin waves are [[Earth's gravity|gravity]] driven and [[Dispersion relation|non-dispersive]]. This means that Kelvin waves can retain their shape and direction over long periods of time. They are usually created by a sudden shift in the wind, such as the change of the [[trade wind]]s at the beginning of the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]].

Coastal Kelvin waves follow [[shoreline]]s and will always propagate in a [[counterclockwise]] direction in the [[Northern hemisphere]] (with the [[shoreline]] to the right of the direction of travel) and [[clockwise]] in the [[Southern hemisphere]].

Equatorial Kelvin waves propagate to the east in the [[Northern hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern hemisphere]]s, using the [[equator]] as a [[waveguide|guide]].

Kelvin waves are known to have very high speeds, typically around 2–3 meters per second. They have [[wavelength]]s of thousands of kilometers and [[amplitude]]s in the tens of meters.

;Rossby Waves
{{main|Rossby wave}}
[[Rossby wave]]s, or [[planetary wave]]s are huge, slow waves generated in the [[troposphere]] by [[temperature]] differences between the [[ocean]] and the [[continent]]s. Their major [[restoring force]] is the change in [[Coriolis force]] with [[latitude]]. Their wave [[amplitude]]s are usually in the tens of meters and very large [[wavelength]]s. They are usually found at low or mid latitudes.

There are two types of Rossby waves, [[barotropic]] and [[baroclinic]]. Barotropic Rossby waves have the highest speeds and do not vary vertically. Baroclinic Rossby waves are much slower.

The special identifying feature of Rossby waves is that the [[phase velocity]] of each individual wave always has a westward component, but the [[group velocity]] can be in any direction. Usually the shorter Rossby waves have an eastward group velocity and the longer ones have a westward group velocity.

===Climate variability===
[[Image:El-nino.png|right|thumb|350px|December 1997 chart of ocean surface temperature anomaly [°C] during the last strong El Niño]]
The interaction of ocean circulation, which serves as a type of heat pump, and biological effects such as the concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] can result in global [[climate change]]s on a time scale of decades. Known [[climate oscillation]]s resulting from these interactions, include the [[Pacific decadal oscillation]], [[North Atlantic oscillation]], and [[Arctic oscillation]]. The oceanic process of [[thermohaline circulation]] is a significant component of heat redistribution across the globe, and changes in this circulation can have major impacts upon the climate.

====La Niña–El Niño====

====Antarctic circumpolar wave====
{{main|Antarctic Circumpolar Wave}}
This is a coupled [[ocean]]/[[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] [[wave]] that circles the [[Southern Ocean]] about every eight years. Since it is a wave-2 phenomenon (there are two peaks and two troughs in a [[Circle of latitude|latitude circle]]) at each fixed point in space a signal with a [[Simple harmonic motion|period]] of four years is seen. The wave moves eastward in the direction of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]].

===Ocean currents===
Among the most important [[ocean current]]s are the:
* [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]]
* [[Thermohaline circulation|Deep ocean]] (density-driven)
* Western boundary currents
** [[Gulf stream|Gulf Stream]]
** [[Kuroshio Current]]
** [[Labrador Current]]
** [[Oyashio Current]]
** [[Agulhas Current]]
** [[Brazil Current]]
** [[East Australia Current]]
* Eastern Boundary currents
** [[California Current]]
** [[Canary Current]]
** [[Peru Current]]
** [[Benguela Current]]

====Antarctic circumpolar====
The ocean body surrounding the [[Antarctic]] is currently the only continuous body of water where there is a wide latitude band of open water. It interconnects the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] oceans, and provide an uninterrupted stretch for the prevailing westerly winds to significantly increase wave amplitudes. It is generally accepted that these prevailing winds are primarily responsible for the circumpolar current transport. This current is now thought to vary with time, possibly in an oscillatory manner.

====Deep ocean====
In the [[Norwegian Sea]] evaporative cooling is predominant, and the sinking water mass, the [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] (NADW), fills the basin and spills southwards through crevasses in the [[submarine sill]]s that connect [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]]. It then flows along the western boundary of the Atlantic with some part of the flow moving eastward along the equator and then poleward into the ocean basins. The NADW is entrained into the Circumpolar Current, and can be traced into the Indian and Pacific basins. Flow from the [[Arctic Ocean]] Basin into the Pacific, however, is blocked by the narrow shallows of the [[Bering Strait]].

Also see '''[[marine geology]]''' about that explores the [[geology]] of the ocean floor including [[plate tectonics]] that create deep ocean trenches.

====Western boundary====
An idealised subtropical ocean basin forced by winds circling around a high pressure (anticyclonic) systems such as the Azores-Bermuda high develops a [[gyre]] circulation with slow steady flows towards the equator in the interior. As discussed by [[Henry Stommel]], these flows are balanced in the region of the western boundary, where a thin fast polewards flow called a [[western boundary current]] develops. Flow in the real ocean is more complex, but the [[Gulf stream]], Agulhas and [[Kuroshio Current|Kuroshio]] are examples of such currents. They are narrow (approximately 100&amp;nbsp;km across) and fast (approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;m/s).

Equatorwards western boundary currents occur in tropical and polar locations, e.g. the East Greenland and Labrador currents, in the Atlantic and the [[Oyashio Current|Oyashio]]. They are forced by winds circulation around low pressure (cyclonic).

;Gulf stream
The Gulf Stream, together with its northern extension, [[North Atlantic Current]], is a powerful, warm, and swift Atlantic Ocean current that originates in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], exits through the Strait of Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland to the northeast before crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

;Kuroshio
The [[Kuroshio Current]] is an ocean current found in the western Pacific Ocean off the east coast of [[Taiwan]] and flowing northeastward past [[Japan]], where it merges with the easterly drift of the [[North Pacific Current]]. It is analogous to the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean, transporting warm, tropical water northward towards the polar region.

Ocean heat flux is a turbulent and complex system&lt;ref&gt;Talley, Lynne D. "Reading-Advection, transports, budgets". SIO 210: Introduction to Physical Oceanography. (Fall 2013). San Diego: Scripps Institute of Oceanography. University of California San Diego.  Retrieved August 30, 2014. http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~ltalley/sio210/transports/&lt;/ref&gt; which utilizes atmospheric measurement techniques such as [[eddy covariance]] to measure the rate of heat transfer expressed in the unit of [[joules]] or watts per second. [[Heat flux]] is the difference in temperature between two points through which the heat passes. Most of the Earth's heat storage is within its seas with smaller fractions of the heat transfer in processes such as evaporation, radiation, diffusion, or absorption into the sea floor. The majority of the ocean heat flux is through [[advection]] or the movement of the ocean's currents. For example, the majority of the warm water movement in the south Atlantic is thought to have originated in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, Alison M.(1995).

===Sea level change===
{{main|Sea level rise}}
Tide gauges and satellite altimetry suggest an increase in sea level of 1.5–3&amp;nbsp;mm/yr over the past 100 years.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] predicts that by 2081-2100, [[global warming]] will lead to a sea level rise of 260 to 820&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Technical Summary In: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.

==Rapid variations==

===Tides===
{{main|Tides}}
[[Image:Wpdms nasa topo bay of fundy - en.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The '''Bay of Fundy''' is a [[Headlands and bays|bay]] located on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[North America]], on the northeast end of the [[Gulf of Maine]] between the [[Provinces of Canada|provinces]] of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]].]]
The rise and fall of the oceans due to tidal effects is a key influence upon the coastal areas. Ocean tides on the planet Earth are created by the gravitational effects of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]]. The tides produced by these two bodies are roughly comparable in magnitude, but the orbital motion of the Moon results in tidal patterns that vary over the course of a month.

The ebb and flow of the tides produce a cyclical current along the coast, and the strength of this current can be quite dramatic along narrow estuaries. Incoming tides can also produce a [[tidal bore]] along a river or narrow bay as the water flow against the current results in a wave on the surface.

''Tide and Current'' (Wyban 1992) clearly illustrates the impact of these natural cycles on the lifestyle and livelihood of [[Native Hawaiians]] tending coastal fishponds. ''Aia ke ola ka hana'' meaning . . . ''Life is in labor''.

''[[Tidal resonance]]'' occurs in the [[Bay of Fundy]] since the time it takes for a large [[wave]] to travel from the mouth of the [[bay]] to the opposite end, then reflect and travel back to the mouth of the bay coincides with the tidal rhythm producing the world's highest tides.

As the surface tide oscillates over topography, such as submerged seamounts or ridges, it generates [[internal waves]] at the tidal frequency, which are known as [[internal tides]].

===Tsunamis===
{{main|Tsunami}}
A series of surface waves can be generated due to large-scale displacement of the ocean water. These can be caused by sub-marine [[landslide]]s, seafloor deformations due to [[earthquake]]s, or the impact of a large [[meteorite]].

The waves can travel with a velocity of up to several hundred km/hour across the ocean surface, but in mid-ocean they are barely detectable with [[wavelength]]s spanning hundreds of kilometers.

Tsunamis, originally called tidal waves, were renamed because they are not related to the tides. They are regarded as [[Waves and shallow water|shallow-water waves]], or waves in water with a depth less than 1/20 their wavelength. Tsunamis have very large periods, high speeds, and great wave heights.

The primary impact of these waves is along the coastal shoreline, as large amounts of ocean water are cyclically propelled inland and then drawn out to sea. This can result in significant modifications to the coastline regions where the waves strike with sufficient energy.

The tsunami that occurred in [[Lituya Bay]], Alaska on July 9, 1958 was {{convert|520|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and is the biggest tsunami ever measured, almost {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}} taller than the [[Sears Tower]] in Chicago and about {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} taller than the former [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.att.net/~thehessians/tsunamis.html |title=Tsuanmi Threats |accessdate=2008-06-28 |work= |publisher= |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726155930/http://home.att.net/~thehessians/tsunamis.html |archivedate=2008-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface waves===
{{main|Ocean surface waves}}
The wind generates ocean surface waves, which have a large impact on [[offshore construction|offshore structures]], [[naval architecture|ships]], [[coastal]] [[erosion]] and [[sedimentation]], as well as [[harbour]]s. After their generation by the wind, ocean surface waves can travel (as [[Swell (ocean)|swell]]) over long distances.

'''"Rain"''' is a short story by the British writer [[W. Somerset Maugham]]. It was originally published  as '''"Miss Thompson"''' in the April 1921 issue of the American literary magazine ''[[The Smart Set]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019344/literature Literature for ''Sadie Thompson''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is set on a Pacific island: a missionary's determination to reform a prostitute leads to tragedy.

==Background==
[[File:Sadie's as made famous by Somerset Maugham in 'Rain' - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The guest house where from mid-December 1916 author W. Somerset Maugham resided for six weeks during an extended trip through the South Sea Islands is today called the [[Sadie Thompson Inn]].]]
In December 1916 during a tour of the Pacific, Maugham and his secretary/companion [[Gerald Haxton]], on the steamer ''Sonoma'', visited [[Pago Pago]], the capital of [[American Samoa]]. Delayed by a quarantine inspection, Maugham, Haxton and others took lodgings there. Other passengers on the ''Sonoma'' included a "Miss Thompson", and a medical missionary and his wife, who were models for the characters in "Rain".&lt;ref name=rogal&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H0MqigagKTkC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=miss+thompson+somerset+maugham Page 244] Samuel J. Rogal, ''A William Somerset Maugham Encyclopedia''. [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near Pago Pago is [[Rainmaker Mountain]], which gives [[Pago Pago Harbor]] an unusually high rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lonelyplanet.com/tutuila/attractions/rainmaker-mountain/a/poi-sig/1456093/362248 Rainmaker Mountain] Lonely Planet, accessed 27 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Maugham - Rain and other Stories, 1921 - BEIC 2649401.jpg|thumb|Cover of the collection ''Rain and other stories'', New York, Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1921]]

On the way to [[Apia]] in the Pacific, a ship stops at [[Pago Pago]]. The passengers include Dr Macphail and his wife, and Davidson, a missionary, and his wife. (The story is seen from Macphail's point of view.) Because of an epidemic of measles (a serious disease for local people) on the island, the ship cannot leave until it is sure none of the crew are infected. The Macphails and the Davidsons find lodgings with Horn, a trader on the front. For most of their stay there is heavy rain which they find oppresive. Macphail hears from Davidson and his wife about the severity of the missionary in his work.

Also staying there from the ship is Miss Thompson. From her room is heard the sound of a gramophone and men's voices. They remember she came on board at [[Honolulu]] and is presumably from Iwelei, the [[red-light district]] there. Davidson is determined to stop her activities, and tries to get Horn to stop her having visitors. Macphail feels that Davidson is&lt;blockquote&gt;
mysteriously at work. He had an impression that he was weaving a net around the woman, carefully, systematically, and suddenly, when everything was ready would pull the strings tight.{{sfn|"Rain"|p=29}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davidson sees the governor of the island and gets him to put Miss Thompson on the next ship, which goes to San Francisco. The governor, aware that the missionaries have influence, does not change his decision when Macphail visits him. Miss Thompson is distraught, as she will be sent to the penitentiary if she returns to San Francisco. Davidson is often with Miss Thompson, whom he now familiarly calls Sadie. Her personality changes and she becomes repentant, it appears. Davidson says to the Macphails, "It's a true rebirth. Her soul, which was black as night, is now pure and white.... All day I pray with her...."{{sfn|"Rain"|p=45}}

A few days later Davidson's body is found on the beach; he has cut his throat with a razor. Macphail does not understand what happened until, returning to his lodgings, he finds Sadie Thompson has changed suddenly back to "the flaunting quean they had known at first".{{sfn|"Rain"|p=51}} She breaks into "a loud, jeering laugh" at Mrs Davidson and the Macphails, and says to Macphail, "You men! You filthy, dirty pigs! You're all the same, all of you."{{sfn|"Rain"|p=51}}

==Adaptations==

The '''Red Triangle''' is the [[colloquial]] name of a roughly triangle-shaped region off the coast of [[northern California]], extending from [[Bodega Bay]], north of [[San Francisco]], out slightly beyond the [[Farallon Islands]], and down to the [[Big Sur]] region, south of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]].

They are characterised by the absence of any [[magma]] conduit which connects below the surface of a planet.

Rootless cones are formed by [[steam explosion]]s as flowing hot lava crosses over a wet surface, such as a [[swamp]], a [[lake]], or a pond.  The explosive gases break through the lava surface in a manner similar to a [[phreatic eruption]], and the [[tephra]] builds up crater-like forms which can appear very similar to real volcanic craters.

Well known examples are found in [[Iceland]] like the craters in the lake [[Mývatn]] (''Skútustaðagígar''), the [[Rauðhólar]] in the region of the capital city [[Reykjavík]] or the ''Landbrotshólar located in South-Iceland in the'' Katla UNESCO Global Geopark in the vicinity of [[Kirkjubæjarklaustur]]. Rootless cones have also been discovered in the [[Athabasca Valles]] region of [[Mars]], where [[lava]] flows [[superheating|superheated]] [[groundwater]] in the underlying rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, W.

'''Samuel Arthur Campbell''' (1895 - 1962) was born August 1, 1895 in [[Watseka]], [[Iroquois County]], [[Illinois]]. He was the youngest of two children born to Arthur J. and Katherine "Kittie" (née Lyman) Campbell.

Sam Campbell was many things including a [[writer]], [[lecturer]], [[photographer]], and diligent student of [[nature]]. He studied wild animals from his home, which he called ''the Sanctuary of Wegimind'', and during his various travels.

Campbell died April 13, 1962 in Barrington, Illinois.

The '''Statherian Period''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|s|t|ə|ˈ|θ|ɪər|i|ən}}; {{lang-el|σταθερός (statherós)}}, meaning "stable, firm") is the final [[geologic]] [[geologic period|period]] in the [[Paleoproterozoic]] [[era (geology)|Era]] and lasted from {{Period start|Statherian}} [[annum|Mya]] to {{Period start|Calymmian}} Mya (million years ago). Instead of being based on [[stratigraphy]], these dates are defined [[Absolute dating|chronometrically]].

The period was characterized on most [[continent]]s by either new [[Platform (geology)|platform]]s or final [[craton]]ization of [[Fold and thrust belt|fold belt]]s.

By the beginning of the Statherian, the [[supercontinent]] [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] had assembled.

== Mechanisms ==

=== Extension ===

[[File:Fault-Horst-Graben.svg|thumb|Normal faults extending crust through [[Horst (geology)|horst]] and [[graben]] systems]]
Where the lithosphere undergoes horizontal extension at a normal fault or [[rift|rifting center]], the crust will stretch until faulting occurs, either by a system of [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|normal faults]] (which creates [[horst (geology)|horst]]s and [[graben]]s) or by a system of [[Fault (geology)#Listric fault|listric faults.]] These fault systems allow the region to stretch, while also decreasing its thickness. A thinner crust subsides relative to thicker, undeformed crust.&lt;ref name= "ceram" /&gt;

=== Cooling ===

[[File:Subsidence due to loading.png|thumb|Weight causes crustal flexure and subsidence]]
Lithospheric stretching/thinning during rifting results in regional necking of the lithosphere (the elevation of the upper surface decreases while the lower boundary rises). The underlying asthenosphere passively rises to replace the thinned mantle lithosphere. Subsequently, after the rifting/stretching period ends, this shallow asthenosphere gradually cools back into mantle lithosphere over a period of many tens of millions of years. Because mantle lithosphere is denser than asthenospheric mantle, this cooling causes subsidence. This gradual subsidence due to cooling is known as "thermal subsidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0012-821X(78)90071-7 |title=Some remarks on the development of sedimentary basins |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=40 |pages=25 |year=1978 |last1=McKenzie |first1=D |bibcode=1978E&amp;PSL..40...25M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loading ===

The adding of weight by [[sedimentation]] from [[erosion]] or orogenic processes, or loading, causes crustal depression and subsidence. Sediments accumulate at the lowest elevation possible, in accommodation spaces. The rate and magnitude of sedimentation controls the rate at which subsidence occurs. By contrast, in [[Orogeny|orogenic]] processes, mountain building creates a large load on the Earth's crust, causing flexural depressions in adjacent [[lithosphere|lithospheric]] crust.&lt;ref name= "Xie Xiangyang" /&gt;

=== Subduction erosion ===
{{main|Subduction erosion}}

== Environments ==

=== Tectonically inactive ===
These settings are not tectonically active, but still experience large-scale subsidence because of tectonic features of the crust.

==== Intracontinental basins ====
[[File:Formation of passive margins.png|thumb|Formation of passive margin]][[File:Pull Apart Basin.png|thumb|Pull-apart basin created by strike-slip faults]]
[[File:Cross Section.png|thumb|Cross section of a pull-apart basin]]
Intracontinental basins are large areal depressions that are tectonically inactive and not near any plate boundaries.&lt;ref name= "Xie Xiangyang" /&gt; Multiple hypotheses have been introduced to explain this slow, long-lived subsidence:&lt;ref name= "Xie Xiangyang" /&gt; long-term cooling since the breakup of [[Pangea]], interaction of deformation around the edge of the basin and deep earth dynamics.&lt;ref name= "intracontinental"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2008.05.008 |title=Subsidence in intracontinental basins due to dynamic topography |journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors |volume=171 |pages=252 |year=2008 |last1=Heine |first1=Christian |last2=Dietmar Müller |first2=R. |last3=Steinberger |first3=Bernhard |last4=Torsvik |first4=Trond H. |bibcode=2008PEPI..171..252H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extensional===
Tectonic subsidence can occur in these environments as the crust pulls apart.

==== Passive margins ====
Successful rifting creates a spreading center&lt;ref name= "Xie Xiangyang" /&gt; like a mid-ocean ridge, which moves progressively further from coastlines as oceanic lithosphere is produced. Due to this initial phase of rifting, the crust in a [[passive margin]] is thinner than adjacent crust and subsides to create an accommodation space. Accumulation of non-marine sediment forms alluvial fans in the accommodation space. As rifting proceeds, listric fault systems form and further subsidence occurs, resulting in the creation of an ocean basin. After the cessation of rifting, cooling causes the crust to further subside, and loading with sediment will cause further tectonic subsidence.&lt;ref name= "ceram" /&gt;

==== Aulacogens ====
[[Aulacogen]]s occur at failed rifts, where continental crust does not completely split. Similar to the lithospheric heating that occurs during the formation of passive margins, subsidence occurs due to heated lithosphere sagging as spreading occurs. Once tensional forces cease, subsidence continues due to cooling.&lt;ref name= "Xie Xiangyang" /&gt;

===Collisional===
Tectonic subsidence can occur in these settings as the plates collide against or under each other.

====Pull-apart basins====
[[Pull-apart basin]]s have short-lived subsidence that forms from transtensional strike-slip faults. Moderate strike-slip faults create extensional releasing bends and opposing walls pull apart from each other. Normal faults occur, inducing small scale subsidence in the area, which ceases once the fault stops propagating. Cooling occurs after the fault fails to propagate further following the crustal thinning via normal faulting.&lt;ref name= "Xie Xiangyang" /&gt;

====Forearc basins====
[[File:Volcanic Arc System.png]]

[[Forearc|Forearc basins]] form in [[subduction|subduction zones]] as sedimentary material is scraped off the subducting oceanic plate, forming an [[Accretionary wedge|accretionary prism]] between the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the overriding continental plate. Between this wedge and the associated [[volcanic arc]] is a zone of depression in the sea floor. Extensional faulting due to relative motion between the accretionary prism and the volcanic arc may occur. Abnormal cooling effects due to the cold, water-laden downgoing plate as well as crustal thinning due to [[underplating]] may also be at work.&lt;ref name= "Xie Xiangyang" /&gt;

==== Foreland basins ====
[[File:orogenic wedge.jpg|Orogenic wedge including Foreland basin]]

[[Foreland basin]]s are flexural depressions created by large [[Fold-and-thrust-belts|fold thrust]] sheets that form toward the undeformed continental crust. They form as an isostatic response to an orogenic load.

'''''The Natural History of Iceland''''' ({{lang-da|'''Tilforladelige efterretninger om Island'''}}) is a [[natural history]] of [[Iceland]] by Danish lawyer [[Niels Horrebow]]. It was first published in Danish in 1752 with an English translation in 1758.

==History of the work==

The book was intended to correct errors in past natural histories of Iceland, particularly the work of [[Hamburg]] mayor [[Johann Anderson]], who had written about the island without ever actually visiting it. Anderson had relied entirely on accounts from German and Dutch sea captains,&lt;ref name=Notes&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MGsdYvhLxXIC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=%22niels+horrebow%22+snakes+1752+danish&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA186,M1 Notes and Queries: A Medium of Intercommunication for Literary Men, General Readers, Etc]''. Series 4, Volume 5. [[Oxford University Press]], 1870. 186-7.&lt;/ref&gt; but Horrebow lived in Iceland for two years, studying the animals, plants, weather, and geological features. He also made note of the cultural practices of the [[Icelandic people]]. Horrebow's resulting work was published in Danish in 1752, then translated into German (1753), Dutch (1754), English (1758) and French (1764).&lt;ref name=Gunnar&gt;Gunnar Karlsson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mLk_Ox4pPTAC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22niels+horrebow%22+snakes+1752&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U3YsgLn_Ld1NqJFi1vF65bbkNaapg The History of Iceland]''. University of Minnesota Press, 2000. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Concerning Snakes"==

''The Natural History of Iceland'' is often noted for its seventy-second chapter, "Concerning Snakes", which, in its English translation, consists solely of one sentence:

{{cquote|No snakes of any kind are to be met with throughout the whole island.&lt;ref name=Gunnar/&gt;}}

Several works of English literature make light of this brief passage. For example, [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[Life of Johnson]]'' (1791) relates how [[Samuel Johnson]] bragged to a friend that he could recite the chapter in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;James Boswell. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=U_AeAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=horrebow+snakes+johnson&amp;lr= Life of Johnson]''. 1791.&lt;/ref&gt;
And [[William Morris]]' utopian novel ''[[News From Nowhere]]'' (1890) contains a short chapter called "Concerning Politics", in which a resident of "Nowhere" tells the narrator, "We are very well off as to politics,&amp;mdash;because we have none. If you ever make a book out of this conversation, put this in a chapter by itself, after the model of old Horrebow's Snakes in Iceland."&lt;ref&gt;William Morris. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zutjk0zM67MC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=%22if+ever+you+make+a+book%22&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U145JWthmfXQ1sT9sIVO8Iee0MdaA News from Nowhere]''. 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Danish version of the chapter on snakes was actually a full paragraph, rather than just one sentence. It was a direct response to a paragraph in Johann Anderson's book, which claimed that snakes could not survive the cold of Iceland. Horrebow's full chapter was translated into English in an 1870 issue of ''[[Notes and Queries]]'':

{{cquote|Serpents there are none in Iceland, as our author [Anderson] truly observes. But when he gives as a reason for this the intense cold of that country, he has been led into an error by false information. We have already spoken of the cold in Iceland, and it may be seen from the accompanying meteorological observations that the cold in the South of Iceland is not more severe than with us in Denmark, so that serpents could as easily live there as here. But since these creatures have not come to Iceland it is well, for no one is likely to trouble himself to transplant them thither.&lt;ref name=Notes/&gt;}}

Although the contributor to ''Notes and Queries'' remarked that "Horrebow's chapter is ... not so ridiculous as generally supposed",&lt;ref name=Notes/&gt; the earlier English translation of the chapter is still much better-known. The phrase "snakes in Iceland" is listed in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', where it is traced to the 1758 translation and defined as "something posited only to be dismissed as non-existent".&lt;ref&gt;"Snake". ''Oxford English Dictionary Online''. Retrieved on July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8811">[[Image:Tlazolteotl 1.jpg|thumb|A depiction of Tlazoteotl, from the [[Codex Borgia]] manuscript.]]
In [[Aztec mythology]], '''Tlazolteotl''' (or {{lang|pt|Tlaçolteotl}}, {{lang-nci|Tlazōlteōtl}}, {{IPA-nah|tɬaso:ɬˈteo:tɬ|pron}}) is a deity of vice, purification, steam baths, 
lust, midwives, filth, and a patroness of adulterers. She is known by three names,{{lang|nci|Tlahēlcuāni}} ('she who eats {{lang|nci|tlahēlli}} or filthy excrescence [sin]') and {{lang|nci|Tlazōlmiquiztli}} ('the death caused by lust'), and {{lang|nci|Ixcuina}} or {{lang|nci|Ixcuinan}} ({{lang-hus|Ix Cuinim}}, Deity of Cotton), the latter of which refers to a quadripartite association of four sister deities.&lt;ref&gt;Soustelle, p.104,199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sahagunp23"&gt;Sahagun, Florentine codex book 1, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan12"&gt;Sullivan, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|nci|Tlazōlteōtl|italic=no}} is the deity for the 13th {{lang|es|[[trecena]]}} of the sacred 260-day calendar [[Tōnalpōhualli]], the one beginning with the day {{lang|nci|Ce Ōllin}}, or First Movement. She is associated with the day sign of the [[jaguar]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan&lt;/ref&gt;

Tlazolteotl played an important role in the confession of wrongdoing, through her priests.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagun p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=Aztec religion=
[[File:British Museum Huaxtec 1-2.jpg|thumb|Huaxtec statue of Tlazolteotl from Mexico, 900-1521 CE ([[British Museum]], id:{{British-Museum-db|Am1989,Q.3|476726}})]] Tlazolteotl may have originally been a [[Huastec people|Huaxtec]] deity from the Gulf Coast&lt;ref name="Miller &amp; Taube, p.168"&gt;Miller &amp; Taube, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; who would have been assimilated into the Aztec pantheon.
==Quadripartite Deities==
Under the name of {{lang|nci|Ixcuinan}} she was thought to be [[wiktionary:quadrupartite| quadrupartite]], composed of four sisters of different ages known by the names {{lang|nci|Tiyacapan|italic=no}} (the [[first born]]), {{lang|nci|Tēicuih|italic=no}} (the younger sister, also {{lang|nci|Tēiuc}}), {{lang|nci|Tlahco|italic=no}} (the middle sister, also {{lang|nci|Tlahcoyēhua}}) and {{lang|nci|Xōcotzin|italic=no}} (the youngest sister). When conceived of as four individual deities, they were called {{lang|nci|ixcuinammeh}} or {{lang|nci|tlazōltēteoh}}&lt;ref name="Sahagunp23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan12"/&gt;; individually, they were deities of luxury.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagun p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sin==

===Encouragement of Sin===
According to Aztec belief, it was Tlazolteotl who inspired vicious desires, and who likewise forgave and cleaned away sin.&lt;ref name="Soustelle199"/&gt; She was also thought to cause disease, especially [[sexually transmitted disease|STDs]]. It was said that Tlazolteotl and her companions would afflict people with disease if they indulged themselves in forbidden love.&lt;ref name="Soustelle193"/&gt; The uncleanliness was considered both on a physical and moral level, and could be cured by steam bath, a rite of purification, or calling upon the Tlazōltēteoh, the deities of love and desires.&lt;ref name="Soustelle193"&gt;Soustelle, p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purification===
For the Aztecs there were two main deities thought to preside over purification: [[Tezcatlipoca]], because he was thought to be invisible and omnipresent, therefore seeing everything; and Tlazolteotl, the deity of lechery and unlawful love.&lt;ref name="Soustelle199"&gt;Soustelle, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that when a man confessed before Tlazolteotl everything was revealed. Purification with Tlazolteotl would be done through a priest. One could only receive the "mercy" once in their life, which is why the practice was most common among the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagun p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Codex Borbonicus (p. 13).jpg|thumb|From the [[Codex Borbonicus|Codex Borbonicus]], this shows the 13th [[w:en:trecena|trecena]] of the Aztec sacred calendar (''[[w:en:tonalpohualli|tonalpohualli]]'').  The deity [[w:en:Tlazolteotl|Tlazolteotl]], is wearing a flayed human skin and giving birth to [[Cinteotl|Cinteotl]].   The 13 day-signs of this trecena, starting with 1 Earthquake, begin at the bottom left and wrap around.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The priest (''tlapouhqui'') would be consulted by the penitent and would consult the 260-day ritual calendar ([[tonalpohualli|tonalpohualli]]) to determine the best day and time for the purification to take place. On the day of, he would listen to the sins confessed and then render judgment and penance, ranging from fasts to presentation of offerings and ritual song and dance, depending on the nature and the severity of the sin.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagun p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Dirt eating===
{{lang|nci|Tlazōlteōtl|italic=no}} was called "Deity of Dirt" ({{lang|nci|Tlazōlteōtl}}) and "Eater of Ordure" ({{lang|nci|Tlahēlcuāni}}, 'she who eats dirt [sin]'), with her dual nature of deity of dirt and also of [[ritual purification|purification]]. Sins were symbolized by dirt. Her [[coprophagia|dirt-eating]] symbolized the ingestion of the sin, and in doing so purified it.&lt;ref name="Sullivan1982p15"&gt;{{cite book |first=Thelma D. |last=Sullivan |authorlink=Thelma D. Sullivan |date=1982 |title=Tlazolteotl-Ixcuina: The Great Spinner and Weaver |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patrisia2012p98"/&gt; She was depicted with [[ochre]]-colored symbols of divine excrement around her mouth and nose.&lt;ref name="Patrisia2012p98"/&gt; In the [[Classical Nahuatl|Aztec language]] the word for sacred, {{wikt-lang|nci|tzin}}, comes from {{lang|nci|tzintli}}, the buttocks, and religious rituals include offerings of "liquid gold" (urine) and "divine excrement", which Klein jocularly translated to English as "holy shit".&lt;ref name="Patrisia2012p98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein1993p20"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klein |first=Cecelia F. |year=1993 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-14538980/teocuitlatl-divine-excrement-significance.html |title=Teocuitlatl, 'Divine Excrement': The Significance of 'Holy Shit' in Ancient Mexico |journal=[[Art Journal (College Art Association journal)|Art Journal]] |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=20–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process, she helped create harmony in communities.&lt;ref name="Patrisia2012p98"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ikLJLdhpYKoC&amp;pg=PA98 |title=Red Medicine: Traditional Indigenous Rites of Birthing and Healing |last=Gonzales |first=Patrisia |year=2012 |pages=98-99|quote=Klein reinterprets the ochre color symbols found around the mouth and nose of some Tlazolteotl depictions, as well as painted to represent matter emanating from the buttocks — from connoting 'dirt' to 'divine excrement.' She notes that {{lang|nci|tlazōlli}} — interpreted by many academics as Tlazolteotl's root word — is not only excrement or something old or used. Similarly the word for 'venerable' is {{lang|nci|tzin}}, which comes from {{lang|nci|tzintli}}, the buttocks. Urine as 'liquid gold' and offerings of excrement are examples of 'divine excrement' or, as Klein writes playfully, 'Holy Shit'. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival==
{{lang|nci|Tlazōlteōtl|italic=no}} was one of the primary Aztec deities celebrated in the festival of {{lang|nci|[[Ochpaniztli]]}} (meaning "sweeping") that was held September 2–21 to recognize the harvest season. The ceremonies conducted during this timeframe included ritual cleaning, sweeping, and repairing, as well as the casting of corn seed, dances, and military ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p.221&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Corryvreckan Whirlpool - geograph-2404815-by-Walter-Baxter.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|The [[Gulf of Corryvreckan]] whirlpool in Scotland is the third largest whirlpool in the world]]
A '''whirlpool''' is a body of rotating [[water]] produced by the meeting of opposing currents.{{cn|date=August 2018}}{{clarify|reason=Is this universally true?|date=August 2018}} The vast majority of whirlpools are not very powerful and very small whirlpools can be easily seen when a bath or a sink is draining. More powerful ones in seas or oceans may be termed '''''maelstroms'''''. ''[[Vortex]]'' is the proper term for any whirlpool that has a [[downdraft]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In oceans, in narrow straits with fast flowing water, whirlpools are normally caused by [[tides]]; there are few stories of large ships ever being sucked into such a maelstrom, although smaller craft are in danger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webecoist.com/2009/07/24/10-magnificent-maelstroms-and-destructive-whirlpools 10 Magnificent Maelstroms]. WebEcoist. Retrieved 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller whirlpools also appear at the base of many [[waterfall]]s&lt;ref name="fenh"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Family Encyclopedia of Natural History |editor1-first=Rosalind |editor1-last=Carreck |date=1982 |publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group |isbn=0-7112-0225-7 |page=246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be observed downstream from manmade structures such as [[weir]]s and dams. In the case of powerful waterfalls, like [[Niagara Falls]], these whirlpools can be quite strong.

=== Moskstraumen ===
{{main|Moskstraumen}}
Moskstraumen is an unusual system of whirlpools in the open seas in the [[Lofoten Islands]] off the [[Norway|Norwegian coast]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 1958 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second strongest whirlpool in the world with flow currents reaching speeds as high as {{convert|32|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. It finds mention in several books and movies.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012" /&gt;

The Moskstraumen is formed by the combination of powerful semi-diurnal tides and the unusual shape of the [[seabed]], with a shallow ridge between the [[Moskenesøya]] and [[Værøy]] islands which amplifies and whirls the tidal currents.&lt;ref name="Compton2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWwQAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|title=Why Sailors Can't Swim and Other Marvellous Maritime Curiosities|last=Compton|first=Nic|date=28 July 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4081-9263-4|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional depictions of the Maelstrom by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Cixin Liu]] describe it as a gigantic circular vortex that reaches the bottom of the ocean, when in fact it is a set of currents and crosscurrents with a rate of {{convert|18|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;B.

=== Corryvreckan ===
{{main|Corryvreckan}}
[[File:Corryvreckan.jpg|thumb|Corryvreckan whirlpool]]
The Corryvreckan is a narrow [[strait]] between the islands of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] and [[Scarba]], in [[Argyll and Bute]], on the northern side of the [[Gulf of Corryvreckan]], [[Scotland]].

[[Old Sow whirlpool]] is located between Deer Island, [[New Brunswick]], Canada, and Moose Island, Eastport, [[Maine]], USA. It is given the epithet "pig-like" as it makes a screeching noise when the vortex is at its full fury and reaches speeds of up to {{convert|27.6|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Compton2013" /&gt; The smaller whirlpools around this Old Sow are known as "Piglets.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012" /&gt;

[[French Pass]] ({{lang|fr|Te Aumiti}}) is a narrow and treacherous stretch of water that separates D'Urville Island from the north end of the South Island of New Zealand. In 2000 a whirlpool there caught student divers, resulting in fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divenewzealand.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/frenchpass.pdf|format=PDF|last=Smith|first=I R|title=In the matter of an inquest into the deaths of Narelle Taniko te Purei, Ricki Graeme McDonald and Michael David Welsh|date=14 April 2003|publisher=Nelson District Coroner|via=Dive New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a short-lived whirlpool that sucked in a portion of the 1300 acre (~530 hectares) [[Lake Peigneur]] in [[Louisiana, United States]] after a drilling mishap in November 1980. This was not a naturally occurring whirlpool, but a man-made disaster caused by underwater drillers breaking through the roof of a salt mine. The lake then drained into the mine until the mine filled and the water levels equalized but the ten-foot deep lake was now 1,300 feet deep. This mishap resulted in destruction of five houses, loss of nineteen barges and eight tug boats, oil rigs, a mobile home, and most of a botanical garden. The adjacent settlement of Jefferson Island was reduced in area by 10%. A crater 0.5-mile (~1km) across was left behind. Nine of the barges which had sunk floated back.&lt;ref name="Pile2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Pile|title=The Not Terribly Good Book of Heroic Failures: An intrepid selection from the original volumes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_qS4RW5nw0C&amp;pg=PT146|date=4 October 2012|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=978-0-571-27734-6|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heggen2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Heggen|title=Underground Rivers: From the River Styx to the Rio San Buenaventura, with occasional diversions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zczBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1108|date=16 January 2015|publisher=Richard Heggen|pages=1108–|id=GGKEY:BS7JB1BB957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Recovery&gt;{{cite web|url= http://members.tripod.com/%7Eearthdude1/texaco/texaco.html |title= And away goes the lake down the drain!|accessdate=23 May 2016|publisher=Archive of tripod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent example of a man-made whirlpool that received significant media coverage was in early June 2015, when an intake vortex formed in [[Lake Texoma]], on the Oklahoma–Texas border, near the floodgates of the dam that forms the lake. At the time of the whirlpool's formation, the lake was being drained after reaching its highest level ever. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], which operates the dam and lake, expected that the whirlpool would last until the lake reached normal seasonal levels by late July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kxii.com/home/headlines/Levels-at-Lake-Texoma-decrease-rare-look-at-intake-vortex-306557501.html |title=Levels at Lake Texoma decrease; rare look at intake vortex |first=Chelsi |last=Smith |publisher=[[KXII]]-TV |location=Sherman, TX |date=8 June 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dangers ==
[[File:'Edgard Poë et ses oeuvres' by Lix and Dargent 5.jpg|thumb|An illustration from Jules Verne's essay "Edgard Poë et ses oeuvres" (''Edgar Poe and his Works'', 1862) drawn by Frederic Lix or Yan' Dargent]]
Powerful whirlpools have killed unlucky seafarers, but their power tends to be exaggerated by laymen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythbustersresults.com/episode56 MythBusters Episode 56: Killer Whirlpool]. Mythbustersresults.com. Retrieved 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There are virtually no stories of large ships ever being sucked into a whirlpool. Tales like those by [[Paul the Deacon]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Jules Verne]] are entirely fictional.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul the Deacon]], ''[[History of the Lombards]]'' (8th century AD); [[Edgar Allan Poe]], "[[A Descent into the Maelström]]" (1841); and [[Jules Verne]], ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, temporary whirlpools caused by major engineering disasters are capable of submerging large ships. A prominent example is the drilling disaster that occurred on November 20, 1980, in [[Lake Peigneur]]. A drilling platform, eleven barges, several trees, and multiple acres of the surrounding terrain were submerged by the resulting whirlpool. Days after the disaster, once the water pressure equalized, nine of the eleven sunken barges popped out of the whirlpool and refloated on the lake's surface.

== In literature and popular culture ==
Apart from Poe and Verne other literary source is of the 1500s, of [[Olaus Magnus]], a Swedish Bishop, who had stated that the maelstrom which was more powerful than ''The Odyssey'' destroyed ships which sank to the bottom of the sea, and even whales were sucked in. [[Pytheas]], the Greek historian, also mentioned that maelstroms swallowed ships and threw them up again.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Charybdis]] in [[Greek mythology]] was later rationalized as a whirlpool, which sucked entire ships into its fold in the narrow coast of [[Sicily]], a disaster faced by navigators.&lt;ref name="Andrews2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Tamra |title=Dictionary of Nature Myths: Legends of the Earth, Sea, and Sky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC&amp;pg=PA171|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513677-7|page=171|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 8th century, [[Paul the Deacon]], who had lived among the Belgii, described [[tidal bore]]s and the maelstrom for a Mediterranean audience unused to such violent tidal surges:&lt;ref name="Deacon2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Deacon|first=Paul the |title=History of the Lombards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zt3jZ69vJKQC&amp;pg=PA8|date=3 June 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0558-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=Not very far from this shore … toward the western side, on which the ocean main lies open without end, is that very deep whirlpool of waters which we call by its familiar name "the navel of the sea." This is said to suck in the waves and spew them forth again twice every day. … They say there is another whirlpool of this kind between the island of Britain and the province of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and with this fact the coasts of the Seine region and of Aquitaine agree, for they are filled twice a day with such sudden inundations that any one who may by chance be found only a little inward from the shore can hardly get away. I have heard a certain high nobleman of the [[Gaul]]s relating that a number of ships, shattered at first by a tempest, were afterwards devoured by this same [[Charybdis]]. And when one only out of all the men who had been in these ships, still breathing, swam over the waves, while the rest were dying, he came, swept by the force of the receding waters, up to the edge of that most frightful abyss. And when now he beheld yawning before him the deep chaos whose end he could not see, and half dead from very fear, expected to be hurled into it, suddenly in a way that he could not have hoped he was cast upon a certain rock and sat him down.|source=Paul the Deacon, ''History of the Lombards'', i.6}}

Three of the most notable literary references to the Lofoten Maelstrom date from the nineteenth century. The first is the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] short story "[[A Descent into the Maelström]]" (1841). The second is ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870), the famous novel by [[Jules Verne]]. At the end of this novel, [[Captain Nemo]] seems to commit suicide, sending his ''Nautilus'' submarine into the Maelstrom (although in Verne's [[The Mysterious Island|sequel]] Nemo and the Nautilus were seen to have survived). The "Norway maelstrom" is also mentioned in [[Herman Melville|Herman Melville's]] ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Melville ''Moby-Dick'' [[s:Moby-Dick/Chapter 36|Chapter 36]], Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'Life of [[St Columba]]', the author, [[Adomnan of Iona]]', attributes to the saint miraculous knowledge of a particular bishop who ran into a whirlpool off the coast of Ireland. In Adomnan's narrative, he quotes Columba saying&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=Cólman mac Beognai has set sail to come here, and is now in great danger in the surging tides of the whirlpool of Corryvreckan. Sitting in the prow, he lifts up his hands to heaven and blesses the turbulent, terrible seas. Yet the Lord terrifies him in this way, not so that the ship in which he sits should be overwhelmed and wrecked by the waves, but rather to rouse him to pray more fervently that he may sail through the peril and reach us here.}}

== Etymology ==
One of the earliest uses in English of the [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] word (''malström'' or ''malstrøm'') was by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in his short story "[[A Descent into the Maelström]]" (1841). In turn, the Nordic word is derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''maelstrom'', modern spelling ''maalstroom'', from ''malen'' (''to grind'') and ''stroom'' (''stream''), to form the meaning ''grinding current'' or literally "mill-stream", in the sense of milling (grinding) grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6981">[[File:William j. long.jpg|thumb|right|Long as depicted by ''The Bookman'' in 1907]]
'''William Joseph Long''' ([[North Attleboro]], Mass., 3 April 1867&lt;ref name=born&gt;''Who's who in America'', cited in [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/89649#page/7/mode/1up ''William J. Long and his book'' - a pamphlet &lt;nowiki&gt;[1903]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; – 1952) was an [[United States|American]] writer, naturalist and minister.  He lived and worked in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] as a minister of the First [[Congregationalist Church]].

As a naturalist, he would leave Stamford every March, often with his son, Brian, and two daughters, [[Lois Long|Lois]] and Cesca, to travel to "the wilderness" of [[Maine]].  There they would stay until the first snows of October, although sometimes he would stay all winter.  In the 1920s, he began spending his summers in [[Nova Scotia]], claiming "the wilderness is getting too crowded".

He wrote of these wilderness experiences in the books ''Ways of Wood Folk'', ''Wilderness Ways'', ''Wood-folk Comedies'', ''Northern Trails'', ''Wood Folk at School'', and many others.  His earlier books were illustrated by [[Charles Copeland (illustrator)|Charles Copeland]]; two later ones were illustrated by [[Charles Livingston Bull]].  Long believed that the best way to experience the wild was to plant yourself and sit for hours on end to let the wild "come to you; and they will!"

== Controversy ==
Because of the increased public interest in the natural world as a reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]], Rev. Long's books were finding a large audience and even being issued in schools under the title of The Wood Folk Series.  However, his findings and observations clashed with the prevailing scientific wisdom of animal behavior, which believed animals behaved purely on instinct, and could not learn from experience: a bird builds a nest purely by instinct and is not taught the skills required. Rev. Long provided many examples, supposedly from his experience, to cast doubt on that prevailing wisdom, suggesting that in fact animals did learn, and each could become individuals within their species. Some of the more famous observations were that kingfishers would catch fish in a river and then drop them into small pools so their offspring could practice catching the same fish but in an easier environment.  He also chronicled a woodcock that made a "splint" for its broken leg. He also wrote of foxes that rode on the backs of sheep to escape hunters and porcupines curling into balls and rolling down hills.

All this led to a belief that Rev. Long (and others) were anthropomorphizing animal behavior, blurring the lines between the animal world and humans. This came to a head when President Teddy Roosevelt's naturalist adviser, [[John Burroughs]], accused Rev. Long (and others) of gross exaggeration, if not outright lies, regarding his books and the reflections of nature therein. Roosevelt wrote "If he stated that he had seen a weasel kill a deer and then carry it to the top of a pine tree, I would not care how many affidavits he produced, because the feat would be mechanically impossible." Long thus found himself at the center of the [[nature fakers controversy]] of the early 1900s. Ultimately Burroughs claimed Rev. Long was trying to sell books to gullible readers with such lies and President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] himself had Rev. Long's books taken from all school libraries.

The local Stamford paper chronicled the feud with "our dashing Rev. Long".  Rev. Long would counter that you cannot "understand nature when you have a gun on your hip, ride on top of a wagon or horseback, and have a crowd of twenty with you," taking aim at Teddy Roosevelt's much publicized and photographed forays into nature.  He went so far to state Roosevelt "never met an animal he didn't kill."  After a couple months back and forth in the Stamford and national papers, Rev. Long said that "while obviously we cannot settle this through the media, I invite President Roosevelt anytime to Stamford to settle this like men."

Roosevelt never accepted his invitation.

A '''winter storm''' is an event in which varieties of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are formed that only occur at low [[temperature]]s, such as [[snow]] or [[Ice pellets|sleet]], or a rainstorm where ground temperatures are low enough to allow [[ice]] to form (i.e. [[freezing rain]]). In temperate continental [[climate]]s, these storms are not necessarily restricted to the winter season, but may occur in the late autumn and early spring as well. Very rarely, they may form in summer, though it would have to be an abnormally cold summer, such as the summer of [[Year Without a Summer|1816]] in the [[Northeastern United States]].

[[File:SLCcloudyApril.jpg|thumb|Approaching winter storm in [[Salt Lake City]].]]

'''Snowstorms''' are storms where large amounts of snow fall.  {{convert|2|in|cm|0|spell=In}} of snow is enough to create serious disruptions to [[traffic]] and school transport (because of the difficulty to drive and maneuver the school buses on slick roads). This is particularly true in places where snowfall is not typical but heavy accumulating snowfalls can occur. In places where snowfall is typical, such small snowfalls are rarely disruptive, because of effective snow and ice removal by municipalities, increased use of [[four-wheel drive]] and [[snow tire]]s, and drivers being more used to winter conditions. Snowfalls in excess of {{convert|6|in|cm}} are usually universally disruptive.

A massive snowstorm with strong winds and other conditions meeting certain criteria is known as a [[blizzard]]. A large number of heavy snowstorms, some of which were blizzards, occurred in the [[United States]] during [[Great Blizzard of 1888|1888]] and [[North American blizzard of 1947|1947]] as well as the early and mid-1990s. The snowfall of 1947 exceeded {{convert|2|ft|cm}} with drifts and snow piles from plowing that reached {{convert|12|ft|m}} and for months, temperatures did not rise high enough to melt the snow. The [[1993 Storm of the Century|1993 "Superstorm"]] manifested as a blizzard in most of the affected areas.

Large snowstorms could be quite dangerous: a {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} snowstorm will make some unplowed roads impassable, and it is possible for [[automobiles]] to get stuck in the snow. Snowstorms exceeding {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} especially in southern or generally warm climates will cave the [[roof]]s of some homes and cause the loss of electricity. Standing dead trees can also be brought down by the weight of the snow, especially if it is wet or very dense. Even a few inches of dry snow can form drifts many feet high under windy conditions.

=== Dangers of snow ===

Accumulating snow can make driving motor vehicles very hazardous. Accumulation of snow on roadways reduces friction between tires and the pavement, which in turn lowers the maneuverability of a vehicle considerably. As a result, average driving speeds on public roads and highways are reduced by up to 40% while heavy snow is falling.&lt;ref&gt;https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/weather_events/snow_ice.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Visibilities are reduced by falling snow, and this is further exacerbated by strong winds which are commonly associated with winter storms producing heavy snowfall. In [[Blizzard|extreme cases]], this may lead to prolonged [[whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions in which visibilities are reduced to only a few feet due to falling or blowing snow. These hazards can manifest even after snowfall has ended when strong winds are present, as these winds will pick up and transport fallen snow back onto roadways and reduce visibilities in the process. This can even result in [[Ground blizzard|blizzard conditions]] if winds are strong enough.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.weather.gov/mkx/wwa-impacts&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy snowfall can immobilize a vehicle entirely, which may be deadly depending on how long it takes rescue crews to arrive. The clogging of a vehicle's tailpipe by snow may lead to [[carbon monoxide]] buildup inside the cabin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.weather.gov/dmx/wintersafety&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the temperature profile in the atmosphere, snow can be either ''wet'' or ''dry''. Dry snow, being lighter, is transported by wind more easily and accumulates more efficiently. Wet snow is heavier due to the increased water content. Significant accumulations of heavy wet snow can cause roof damage. It also requires considerably more energy to move and this can create health problems while shoveling when combined with the harsh weather conditions. Numerous deaths as a result of heart attacks can be attributed to snow removal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-30119410&lt;/ref&gt; Accretion of wet snow to elevated surfaces occurs when snow is "sticky" enough which can cause extensive tree and power line damage in a manner similar to ice accretion during ice storms. Power can be lost for days during a major winter storm, and this usually means the loss of heating inside buildings. Other than the obvious risk of hypothermia due to cold exposure, another deadly element associated with snowstorms is [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] which can happen anytime combustion products from generators or heating appliances are not properly vented. Finally, partially or fully melted snow on roadways can refreeze when temperatures fall, creating [[black ice]].

A sudden rise in air temperature is can result in the rapid melting of snow. This can create flooding issues if the snowpack has sufficient water content, and this can be significantly exacerbated by heavy rainfall and by [[Ice jam|ice jams]] which may have formed on area rivers during prolonged subfreezing temperatures. The re-freezing of previously melted snow creates [[potholes]] in roadways.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.summitengineer.net/resources/learning/52-potholes&lt;/ref&gt; This process is accelerated when water is melted and re-frozen multiple times. Fog is also known to occur during rapid melting of snow.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/weather/ct-wea-0311-summary-20150310-column.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avalanches]] and [[Cornice (climbing)|cornices]] occur when significant amounts of snow falls on mountains.

Heavy showers of [[freezing rain]] are one of the most dangerous types of winter storm. They typically occur when a layer of warm air hovers over a region, but the ambient temperature a few meters above the ground is near or below {{convert|0|°C|°F}}, and the ground temperature is sub-freezing.

While a {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} snowstorm is somewhat manageable by the standards of the northern [[United States]] and [[Canada]], a comparable {{convert|10|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} ice storm can paralyze a region: driving becomes extremely hazardous, telephone and power lines are damaged, and crops may be ruined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/docs/smith-and-katz-2013.pdf Smith A.B. and R. Katz, 2013: U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Data sources, Trends, Accuracy and Biases. Natural Hazards, 67, 387–410, doi:10.1007/s11069-013-0566-5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable ice storms include an [[El Niño]]-related [[January 1998 North American ice storm|North American ice storm of 1998]] that affected much of eastern Canada, including [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]], as well as upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] and part of [[New England]]. Three million people lost power, some for as long as six weeks. One-third of the trees in Montreal's [[Mount Royal]] park were damaged, as well as a large proportion of the [[sugar]]-producing [[maple]] trees. The amount of economic damage caused by the storm has been estimated at $3 billion [[Canadian dollar|Canadian]].

The Christmas Day Ice Storm of 2000 caused devastating electrical issues in parts of [[Arkansas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Texas]]. The city of [[Texarkana, Arkansas]] experienced the worst damage, at one point losing the ability to use telephones, power and running water. In some areas in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas and eventually [[Louisiana]], over an inch of ice accumulated from the freezing rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/shv/?n=ice2000|title=Ice Storm December 25-26, 2000|last=|first=|date=31 July 2009|website=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|access-date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/news/top-10-worst-ice-storms-20131205?pageno=4|title=The Nation's 10 Worst Ice Storms|last=Dolce|first=Chris|last2=Erdman|first2=Jon|date=12 February 2014|website=Weather Underground|publisher=|access-date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North Carolina ice storm of 2002|Ice Storm of December 2002]] in [[North Carolina]] resulted in massive power loss throughout much of the state, and property damage due to falling trees. Except in the mountainous western part of the state, heavy snow and icy conditions are rare in [[North Carolina]].

The [[December 2005 North American ice storm|Ice Storm of December 2005]] was another severe winter storm producing extensive ice damage across a large portion of the Southern United States on December 14 to 16. It led to power outages and at least 7 deaths.

In January 2005, [[Kansas]] had been declared a major disaster zone by President [[George W. Bush]] after an ice storm caused nearly $39 million in damages to thirty-two counties. Federal funds were provided to the counties during January 4&amp;ndash;6, 2005 to aid the recovery process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesskansas.org/ksadjutantgeneral/News%20Releases/2005/Gov%2002-09-05.htm|title=Presidential Disaster Declaration authorized for Kansas counties hit by January ice storm|website=accesskansas.org|accessdate=8 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425095129/http://www.accesskansas.org/ksadjutantgeneral/News%20Releases/2005/Gov%2002-09-05.htm|archivedate=25 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[January 2009 North American ice storm|January 2009 Central Plains and Midwest ice storm]] was a crippling and historic ice storm. Most places struck by the storm, saw {{convert|2|in|mm}} or more of ice accumulation, and a few inches of snow on top of it. This brought down power lines, causing some people to go without power for a few days, to a few weeks. In some cases, some didn't see power for a month or more. At the height of the storm, more than 2 million people were without power.

== Graupel ==
{{Main|Graupel}}

Ice crystals fall through a cloud of super-cooled droplets—minute cloud droplets that have fallen below freezing temperature but have not frozen. The ice crystal plows into the super-cooled droplets and they immediately freeze to it. This process forms ''graupel'', or snow pellets, as the droplet continues to accumulate on the crystal. The pellets bounce when they hit the ground.

== Ice pellets ==
{{Main|Ice pellets}}

Out ahead of the passage of a warm front, falling snow may partially melt and refreeze into a frozen rain drop before it reaches the ground. These ice pellets are called ''sleet'' in most of the [[US]]. Because it is easily seen and does not accumulate ice, it is not as dangerous as freezing rain.

== Rime ==
{{Main|Hard rime}}
{{See also|Soft rime}}

''Rime'' is a milky white accumulation of super-cooled cloud or fog droplets that freeze when they strike an object that has a temperature of {{convert|32|F|C}}, the freezing point of water. The process is called ''riming'' when super-cooled cloud droplets attach to ice crystals in the formation of [[Winter storm#Graupel|graupel]]. Rime ice can pose a hazard to an airliner when it forms on a wing as an aircraft flies through a cloud of super-cooled droplets.
